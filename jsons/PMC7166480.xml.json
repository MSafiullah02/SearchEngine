            "text": "Children and older adults are the most vulnerable groups of the population, and ARIs are the most common cause of their hospitalization worldwide.4, 5 Older adults are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality due to ARIs because of coexisting chronic diseases and immune senescence.6 Although bacteria, fungi, and parasites can cause ARIs, the majority of infections are caused by viruses. The most commonly diagnosed causative viral agents of ARIs are: influenza viruses (Flu) type A and B, adenoviruses (AdV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) types 1 to 4. Additionally, in the last 15 years, newly discovered respiratory viruses have been identified including human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human bocavirus (HBoV), coronaviruses NL63 (HcoV\u2010NL63) and HKU1 (HcoV\u2010HKU1), new human enterovirus (HEV), human parechovirus (HPeV), and human rhinovirus (HRV) strains.7 Influenza is a well\u2010recognized cause of ARIs in adults8, 9 but substantial adult disease is also caused by other respiratory viruses,10 particularly RSV and HMPV.11, 12, 13, 14 Both viruses belong to the new family Pneumoviridae within order Mononegavirales,\n15 and have similar clinical features.16, 17 The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of ARIs in children caused by RSV and HMPV in Croatia are well described.18, 19, 20 In contrast, for adult populations in Croatia, data are limited primarily on influenza viruses due to laboratory use of direct methods (isolation, antigen detection, or molecular methods) for routine diagnosis of respiratory viruses. Influenza diagnosis is performed in the Croatian Institute of Public Health, acting as a National Influenza Centre, that collects samples from several local, regional, and national institutions for the purpose of the influenza surveillance. Therefore, this Centre performs diagnosis of influenza for our hospitals with the results available to clinicians within 24 to 72 hours, depending on the time of sampling. The diagnosis of other respiratory viruses has been neglected and their incidence and role in the etiology of ARI in adults in Croatia is unknown. Also, in the past the burden of noninfluenza respiratory viruses was underestimated due the insensitivity of older microbiologic tests and the inability to get certain types of clinical specimens.21 New molecular techniques for laboratory diagnosis of respiratory viruses, particularly multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), have enabled quick, sensitive, and specific, simultaneous detection of the most common respiratory viruses, making it easier for clinicians to determine etiologic diagnosis of ARIs. However, these molecular diagnostics for respiratory viruses are not available for routine patient care in Croatia. Since the epidemiology of viral infections may vary world\u2010wide, local epidemiological data on viral ARIs will best inform public health authorities to develop efficient prevention measures and strategies. Also, these data could help to promote the introduction of molecular laboratory diagnostics for respiratory viruses in routine medical care procedure in Croatia by improving public and physician awareness of noninfluenza viral disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the viral etiology of ARIs in hospitalized adults in Croatia using multiplex PCR, to compare the prevalence of detected viruses, as well as determine the clinical characteristics and seasonal occurrence of investigated infections.",

The study not only demonstrates the frequency of viral infection in general but also highlights the burden of other respiratory viruses in addition to influenza in the Croatian population. Results of this study showed that the most common virus detected in older adults admitted to the hospital with symptoms of ARIs in Croatia is Flu types A and B which is consistent with many previously published studies.8, 22 However, the detection rate of influenza in this study (51 of 182; 28%) is much higher than in previously mentioned studies originated from the United States and Europe (11.6% and 9%, respectively). These results emphasize the epidemic and unpredictable nature of influenza but also potential opportunities in a country with low influenza vaccine uptake. The second, and the third most commonly detected viruses are the pneumoviruses, namely RSV and HMPV with detection frequencies of 9.3% (17 of 182) and 8.8% (16 of 182). Many studies around the globe have illustrated the importance of RSV as a cause of serious respiratory illness affecting older adults.12, 23, 24 The high frequency of HMPV detection in adults, revealed in this study, is not as commonly reported when compared with the other studies.22, 25 However, one recent study that performed multiple imputation estimations of community\u2010acquired pneumonia (CAP) with detections of specific respiratory viruses among 2259 adults hospitalized with CAP has revealed HMPV and RSV as the second, and third causative agents after Flu with detection frequencies of 3.9% and 3%, respectively.26 Other recent studies using molecular diagnostics highlight the role of HRV as the most prevalent noninfluenza respiratory virus with detection rates of 11.5% in adults greater than 18 years.27 In this study HRV was detected as the fifth most common virus after Flu, RSV, HMPV, and PIVs, with detection rate of 7.7% (14 of 182). HCoV and AdV in this study were detected with equal frequencies (4 of 182; 2.2%) and the low AdV frequency is similar to the other previously mentioned adult studies (1.6%),25 whereas, the incidence of HCoV is lower than prior reports ranging from 3% to 14%.28, 29 HEV was rarely detected (2 of 182; 1%) and was always in codetection with another respiratory virus (Table 1), and HBoV was not detected during the entire study period. It should be noted that HBoV was detected in children during the same period at the same geographic region (Zagreb, Croatia) with frequencies of 6.2% (7 of 275) using the same molecular test.30\n",

Although, patients with Flu A/B more often reported ill contacts than other patients, these features are not sufficiently specific to impact care. Of note, HMPV\u2010infected patients had very similar features to those infected with Flu A/B and often received empiric treatment with oseltamivir. Another observation in our study was the high rate of antibiotics prescribed in patients with documented viral respiratory infection (up to 65%) and underscores the need for more judicious antibiotic use.",

With exception of influenza where diagnosis leads to specific infection control measures and there is antiviral therapy currently available, the effect on patient management is less clear for the diagnosis other viruses. However, there are encouraging reports that if viral diagnosis is combined with proper clinical judgment and education, more rational use of antiviral drugs and antibiotics may result from the additional information.36 The use of serum biomarkers such as procalcitonin or CRP to assess likelihood of concomitant bacterial infection may be complementary to viral testing and enhance rational antibiotic prescription.37\n",

The current study conducted in adults, did not confirm biennial RSV cycles, although conclusions about biennial occurrence is not possible in a 2.5\u2010year study. Interestingly, high HMPV epidemic waves were still observed in even years (Figure 2). HRV mostly occurred in the spring and fall months although other studies reported its occurrence during colder months.38 To the best of our knowledge this is the first report for HRV epidemiology in Croatia since laboratory diagnosis for HRV in Croatia was not possible until this study. Meta\u2010analysis studies are being performed to make global estimates of seasonality and burden of disease and require the input specific viral activity data from different countries to make accurate estimates.39 In addition, new adult vaccines for RSV are in active clinical development.40 As new products become available, health ministries will need accurate local viral activity and seasonality data for optimal deployment.",
