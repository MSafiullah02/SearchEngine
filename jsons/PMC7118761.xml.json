The growing burden of non-communicable chronic diseases, threats of new emerging infections, demographic shifts and global environmental concerns underline the importance of population approaches that take account of a broad view of health. The emergence of human swine flu in Mexico and the USA, and the subsequent worldwide pandemic reinforce the importance of the lessons of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) for strong public health systems. The need for capacity in the public health workforce is not only for disease control and health protection, but also to ensure that health systems deliver effective health care. Conversely, discussion of the role of primary health care in ensuring better public health is gaining greater prominence. The challenges of modern epidemics cannot only be addressed through doctor\u2013patient interactions, and consideration of socio-economic factors is increasingly recognized as key to effective practice.",

This is reflected in increasing demand, rising costs, and a return towards curative and hospital care, making re-exploration of the Alma-Ata principles both timely and relevant.3 A better alignment of a population-based public health approach with personal health services is needed urgently, along with better integration of personal health care and public health. To quote van Weel et al., primary care needs to be organized on the principle of care for individuals in the context of the population, and the future of primary care, and health care in general, will depend on how effectively a community-oriented approach and its contribution to equity and social cohesion is achieved.2\n",

Arguing the need to revisit Alma-Ata, the report identifies four broad policy directions of improving health for all: tackling health inequalities through universal coverage; putting people at the centre of care; integrating health into broader public policy; and providing inclusive leadership for health.4 This approach requires public health strategies as well as clinical skills in meeting the needs of populations, particularly the poor and vulnerable, and is congruent with the influential report from the Commission on Social Determinants of Health which stresses the relevance of an ecological approach to health, essential to achieving the millennium development goals.5 The implicit need for stronger public health was again re-inforced by the 2009 WHO World Health Assembly resolution which calls for primary healthcare services to provide health promotion and disease prevention as well as curative care and palliative care, and for integration and co-ordinated practice to take account of the needs of populations and to promote active participation by all people.6\n",

Whereas the traditional concern of public health, particularly within Asia, was with controlling communicable disease, the present challenges also include the burden of the epidemic of non-communicable disease and achieving health for all with the limited resources available. Protecting and promoting health amongst a growing elderly population, as well as maintaining efforts to reduce the burden of disease related to infections such as tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, requires a well-prepared workforce. The increasing emphasis on health literacy, social marketing and community empowerment further highlights the need for new skills and training. Such an analysis therefore raises the key question: How should we educate for better public health practice and who should we educate?",

Public health uses collective or population methods and concerns about the health of the entire population, whereas clinical interventions are targeted at individuals and for the health of the individual. As the population consists of individuals, the two approaches are inevitably inter-related. Collective interventions such as policies will eventually affect individuals and often also need individual participation, whereas interventions for individuals add up to the totality of the society's effort although they could also directly affect the population, such as in the control of infectious diseases. Historically, public health concepts and practice originate from the prevention of communicable diseases, either at an individual level or population level, and have been included in public health practice. Prevention is thus usually considered a part of public health. However, prevention of chronic diseases such as treating hypertension for prevention of stroke and coronary heart disease is normally viewed as clinical medicine. In addition, in many countries, traditional public health methods targeted at individuals, such as vaccination and child and maternal care, have been successfully relocated into the clinical sector, most often primary care or general practice. Such individual public health approaches to prevention are too important to be neglected.",

One solution which could be developed is enhanced co-operation between schools of public health and health providers, such as centres for disease control and protection. They could collaborate to develop new ways of working, such as public health case teaching and field training. Health professionals from centres for disease control and protection could also play a more important role in teaching courses, particularly the practical aspects. There are great opportunities for joint research to address current important health problems of the community. What is needed is a mechanism to co-ordinate trainers from universities and healthcare institutions to enable achievement of educational and training aims. Field practice of students also needs to be improved; for example, by adjusting the length of practical experience, engaging school teachers and health professionals to help supervise practice, and selecting appropriate topics for practical experience for future careers.",

The report22 sets out basic competencies and curricula. This trend to a broader liberal education is being followed in Hong Kong, where the university curriculum is being extended to 4 years along the lines of the US and mainland Chinese model. Not only has a new BSc now been introduced at university level,23 but public health has been added into the curriculum for high school students as part of liberal studies for all students, and a further module on health and social care management is also being taught in years 4\u20136 in middle school.24 In the USA, there is a growing demand for public health undergraduate courses, and the Association of Schools of Public Health is in the process of devising undergraduate public health competencies. The Asia-Pacific Academic Consortium of Public Health is working to improve public health through the delivery of education, research and public health programmes by member institutions, and actively supports increasing undergraduate public health opportunities, stressing that public health education is more urgent for its region than the rest of the world and that a better system needs to be built, based on developments and experiments already occurring in other universities and other countries and regions.25\n",

General education does not need to be as formal as degrees and should include diploma and certificate training, short courses and on-the-job training, as well as considering how to provide education and information to the public.\u2022Better workforce planning is needed to respond to the needs of communities.\u2022Training of different talents according to the different regional needs should be considered.\u2022Engaging and informing the public in the discussion about the need for a strong public health workforce is essential, as is political commitment.\n",
