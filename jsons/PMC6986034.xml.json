            "text": "In the early phases of resuscitation for undifferentiated shock, uncertainty regarding the underlying etiology and patient comorbidities are common reasons for non-patient-centered resuscitation practices, conflicting treatments, unwarranted practice variability, and failure to meet targeted end points for initial resuscitation [1]. A positive association between fluid balance and mortality has been demonstrated in observational studies [2\u20138]. In smaller retrospective studies, however, comparisons of administered fluid volumes between resuscitation groups are frequently confounded by disease severity. Additionally, the extent and impact of variable fluid resuscitation decisions in common usual care practice is poorly characterized. Consequently, assessments of actual administered fluid volumes alone may not effectively address the clinical appropriateness of fluid resuscitation or the effects of relative under- and over-resuscitation on patient outcomes.",

We sought to determine the impact of variable DOF volumes on hospital mortality in the most severely ill patients, including those with undifferentiated shock and septic shock. Additionally, we sought to identify hospital- and patient-level contextual factors that contribute to irregular practice and evaluate whether these predict or explain differences in prescribed fluid volumes and hospital mortality. We hypothesized that mechanically ventilated patients with shock are frequently prescribed greater- or less-than-expected DOF volumes resulting in adverse impacts on standardized hospital mortality after risk adjustment.",

Since clock time is not recorded, fluid use was captured for the calendar day and not for a 24-h period. To compensate for this, cases with less than 1 L of DOF were excluded (Fig. 1).

All patients in the inclusion cohort were predicted to receive a comorbidity-adjusted baseline DOF of 2.42 L (2.34\u20132.50 L). The model identified eight admission diagnoses that contributed towards a probability of receiving less fluid (fluid reductive factors, FRFs) and five admission diagnoses that contributed towards a probability of receiving more fluid compared to baseline. Patients with FRFs tended to be older than those without FRFs (66.6 vs. 54.8 years, p < 0.0001). As anticipated, patients with FRFs had a higher average number of organ dysfunctions present on admission than those without FRFs (2.3 vs. 2.1, p < 0.0001) and increased frequency of comorbid diseases (Table 1).

Diagnoses identified as FRFs frequently include volume overload as a primary or secondary feature, potentially explaining the observed mortality benefit of receiving less-than-expected fluid volumes among patients with at least one of these conditions. Patients without an FRF were generally younger and had fewer comorbidities and acute organ dysfunctions present on admission. They also had lower predicted hospital mortality compared to patients with an FRF. Nonetheless, hospital mortality for patients without an FRF was increased with higher and lower fluid volumes and with greater- and less-than-expected fluid resuscitation. These findings challenge the assumption that younger and presumably healthier patients are more tolerant of a wide range of fluid resuscitation volumes. Likewise, we observed significantly lower ICU and hospital resource utilization and lower hospital costs among patients without an FRF despite higher-than-predicted risk-adjusted hospital mortality. This incongruity may reflect relatively less attentive care-titration for a population presumed to have lower risk for further clinical decompensation.",

However, comorbidity-based risk-adjustment indices (e.g., Charlson index AUROC = 0.67) have been shown to perform similarly well as severity of illness scores (APACHE II AUROC = 0.805 and SAPS II AUROC = 0.843) in predicting short-term mortality following ICU admission [18\u201320]. The discriminative ability of our comorbidity-based mortality model, while still dependent on ICD-9-CM-based coding instead of physiologic variables, compares favorably (AUROC = 0.80). In addition, the linear relationship between prescribed fluid volumes and predicted mortality observed in our model is consistent with prior observational studies suggesting a positive correlation between administered fluids and mortality. The range of predicted DOF accurately correlated with the range of observed DOF, and the \u00b1 1.5-L DOF cutoff was validated by the continuous deviation of observed from predicted mortality rates both above and below this critical value. Nonetheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that variance with respect to predicted versus observed DOF may be related to the performance of our model. Thus, while acknowledging the limitation of the current administrative dataset analyses, future prospective studies should evaluate the temporal relationship between prescribed fluid volumes and mechanical ventilation or other physiologic variables. Such an approach would facilitate further categorization of disease severity, for example by computing Sequential Organ Assessment (SOFA) scores for patients with sepsis, and elucidate the causal relationship between suboptimal fluid resuscitation and adverse outcomes.",

To mitigate this potential bias, we excluded hospitals where the 25th percentile for recorded DOF was below 250 mL and any cases where the DOF was less than 1 L (185 hospitals, 33%). The potential for ascertainment bias, however, exists as a result of excluding patients who may be admitted late in the calendar hospital day and hospitals with systematic underreporting of administered fluid volumes. With respect to identifying patients with shock, we attempted to address this by defining shock according to whether the subject was prescribed a vasopressor on hospital day 1 or 2. Furthermore, while isolating a higher risk population, patients with shock who require mechanical ventilation may represent a phenotypically distinct but heterogeneous subgroup. In separate analyses, we observed comparable associations in acutely resuscitated patients regardless of the need for ventilator support (unpublished data). Categorization of different shock states in administrative data is limited without access to patient-specific physiologic variables. For the purposes of the current analysis, we refer to all shock states as \u201cundifferentiated shock\u201d while acknowledging that bedside clinical assessment is likely to have informed a more precise etiology of shock that contributed to fluid resuscitation decisions. Finally, the present analysis does not distinguish between types of fluid administered that is the focus of ongoing studies. Though resuscitation with crystalloid rather than colloid fluids may have contributed to variability in DOF volumes [21], fluid type has not been consistently associated with differences in shock resuscitation outcomes [21\u201323].",

Further validation analyses in separate cohorts will be required to confirm the performance our novel risk-adjusted models. Institutional differences, including hospital size, teaching status, location, or geographic region, were not associated with variability in DOF resuscitation. While likely not a function exclusively of organizational or hospital-level factors, these data do not preclude that there may be significant individual- or team-level practice variability.
