Chronic HEV infection is defined by persistent HEV replication for more than three months [11,12]. These chronic infections are caused by genotype 3 and genotype 4 and may rapidly evolve to cirrhosis and loss of a liver graft [13,14]. Ribavirin has become the drug of choice for treating chronic HEV infections in immunocompromised [15,16]. While a decrease in HEV RNA in blood of 0.5 log copies/ml or greater by 7 days after initiation of ribavirin therapy is predictive of a response [17], detecting HEV RNA in the faeces despite a negative HEV RNA in blood is a strong predictor of a relapse in immunocompromised subjects [18]. Therefore, monitoring HEV faecal excretion could help determine the optimal duration of ribavirin therapy and has been recommended for managing chronic HEV infections in solid-organ transplant recipients [19]. However, the presence of PCR inhibitors in this particular matrix can make detecting HEV RNA difficult [[20], [21], [22]]. No commercial HEV RNA assay is presently validated for faecal samples.",

Clearly, the RNA extraction method is most important. Many PCR inhibitors are presumed to affect directly the RNA or the enzymes of the reaction [20,25]. Several inhibitors have been found in faeces: polysaccharides or chlorophyll originating from vegetables, bile salts, urea, glycolipids and heparin [[26], [27], [28]]. The QIAamp kit has been validated for extracting viruses from food [29,30] and this study indicates that it is suitable for extracting HEV RNA from faeces. The ef\ufb01ciency with which the RNA extraction method removes inhibitors or debris and produces nucleic acid extracts of high purity signi\ufb01cantly affects the detection of the target by RT-PCR [20,29,31]. A study that evaluated six commercial extraction platforms for detecting SARS Coronavirus frm faeces indicated that the MagNA Pure method performed less well than other automated platform that used magnetic beads (miniMag by bioM\u00e9rieux or the Magazorb by Cortex Biochem) [31]. Inhibitors can also be removed from faecal samples by sample dilution or using less faeces. This was successful when the Altona retested 2 negative samples. The Altona assay has an internal control that is introduced into the RT-PCR mix and thus acts as an ampli\ufb01cation control (controlling only the performance of the PCR itself). A limitation of the reference LDT assay is the absence of an internal control. Nevertheless, a negative internal control was not always seen in results that were HEV RNA-positive with the reference RT-PCR and HEV RNA-negative with Altona RT-PCR. Moreover, the Altona assay package insert indicates that the internal control can also be placed in the lysis buffer during extraction. This may evaluate inhibition better in challenging matrice such as faeces.",
