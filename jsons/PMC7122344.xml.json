Co-infections with influenza viruses may induce re-assortment between the viruses, leading to a more pathogenic subtype (Liu et al. 2010). In particular, co-infections with different subtypes of influenza A virus constitute a likely source of reassortants that can acquire unpredictable properties (Pajak et al. 2011). A sectional structure of the influenza virus genome brings about the variation of genotype and phenotype of the virus. When the host cell is infected with more than one strain, viruses equipped with a new set of genes may appear. Considering the essential role of co-infections in spread and severity of the disease, the goal of this study was to determine the frequency and a crisscross pattern of co-infections with influenza and influenza-like viruses.",

In the 2012/2013 season, co-infections were as follows: ten of subtype A/H1N1/pdm09 with A/H3N2/ and 8 of A/H3N2/ with type B virus (Czarkowski et al. 2014). In the 2013/2014 season, co-infections were as follows: two of subtype A/H1N1/pdm09 with A/H3N2/, seven of influenza with influenza-like viruses (two of influenza type A virus, RSV A virus, and RV A/B virus in one-day old and one-month-old children each), and three of influenza-like viruses (Bednarska et al. 2015). In the 2014/2015 season, in a framework of the I-MOVE (Influenza Monitoring of Vaccine Effectiveness) program, the following co-infections were detected: seven of subtype A/H1N1/pdm09 with type B virus and eight of subtype A/H3N2/ with type B virus. In that last season, in addition, one co-infection of influenza viruses and four of influenza viruses with influenza-like viruses were noted in children under 14 years of age (Hallmann-Szeli\u0144ska et al. 2016). A significant increase in the number of infections with more than one respiratory virus in the 2015/2016 season could be associated with a higher number of samples tested (8542 samples) compared with the two preceding seasons (2479 and 2416 samples, respectively) (Bednarska et al. 2016; Bednarska et al. 2015). Nonetheless, influenza viruses constantly evolve, undergoing antigenic changes, which provides them the ability to elude the host immune response system (Webster et al. 2013).",
