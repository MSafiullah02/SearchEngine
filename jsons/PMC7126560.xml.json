Participants were randomly assigned to receive 2 years of treatment with either fluticasone or placebo, followed by a third observation year, during which no daily study medication was given. During the 2-year treatment period, daily fluticasone therapy significantly reduced symptom frequency, exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids, and need for additional controller medication compared with placebo (Figure 2\n). However, despite the reduction in symptom frequency and exacerbations, there was no long-term effect on symptoms after ICS discontinuation, as the two groups had comparable proportions of episode-free days during the observation year. Furthermore, ICS treatment was associated with a 1.1-cm decrease in linear growth.12 These results suggest that ICSs are effective in reducing daily symptoms and preventing exacerbations in preschool children with recurrent wheeze and a positive mAPI, but should not be used in an attempt to prevent subsequent persistent asthma in such children.",

There was no significant difference between oral prednisolone and placebo in the duration of hospitalization (the primary outcome), any of the secondary outcomes, or the number of adverse events.18 The results, along with an editorial accompanying the article,19 suggest that oral prednisolone should not be routinely given to preschool children presenting to the hospital with acute, mild-to-moderate viral wheezing. However, interpretation of these findings is complicated by a substantial proportion of children in the study who were having their first episode of wheezing because it has been convincingly demonstrated that such episodes (typically diagnosed as bronchiolitis) are poorly responsive to systemic corticosteroid therapy.20 The heterogeneity of the patient population, the relatively mild severity of the wheezing episodes and relatively low dose of prednisolone, and the short duration of hospitalization in the placebo group lend caution to the widespread and complete abandonment of oral corticosteroid use during all acute episodes of viral wheezing. Furthermore, recent studies have raised the possibility of a differential and delayed response to systemic corticosteroids as a function of the infecting virus. In two recent studies, prednisolone reduced recurrent wheezing after episodes triggered by rhinovirus but not respiratory syncytial virus,15, 21 suggesting that rhinovirus-induced early wheezing may be a criterion for the selection of young children who are likely to respond to systemic corticosteroids. The clinical utility of this information will remain to be seen, as the infecting virus is not routinely identified in clinical practice.",

Parental education should focus on the early recognition of symptoms that are likely to be followed by wheezing. If used, episodic ICS treatment should begin as soon as the parent or caregiver believes the child is showing the earliest signs of an impending wheezing episode; starting ICS therapy once wheezing is established is unlikely to provide significant benefit. It is essential to treat all \u201ccolds\u201d as asthma episodes, using asthma medications and not over-the-counter cough and cold products. Should the above strategy not prevent symptom progression, a short course of systemic corticosteroids should be considered, realizing that recent evidence provides some uncertainty as to the efficacy of their use in preschool wheezing illnesses, particularly those not requiring hospital-based care. For patients who have a history of severe exacerbations with viral respiratory tract infections, systemic corticosteroids may be considered at the first (or early) sign of infection and may be available at home. If the strategy of episodic therapy does not help the patient achieve better episode control over time, then consider a daily controller regimen.",

Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that factors determining the development of persistent asthma include early exposure and sensitization to indoor allergens, environmental tobacco smoke, residence near a heavily traveled road, exposure to elevated ozone levels, and sex (male prepuberty, female postpuberty)22, 23 (Figure 4; available at www.jpeds.com).

In the CAMP study,25 children 5 to 12 years of age were treated with either inhaled budesonide, nedocromil, or placebo for 4 to 6 years. There was no difference between groups in the change from baseline in postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second percent (FEV1 %) of predicted. However, treatment with budesonide significantly improved airways responsiveness to methacholine, as well as resulting in fewer hospitalizations, fewer urgent visits to a caregiver, fewer courses of prednisone, and a smaller percentage of days on which SABAs or other asthma medications were needed. Furthermore, the use of budesonide had a small effect on growth (1.1 cm over 4 to 6 years), confirming the efficacy and relative safety of ICSs. However, the beneficial effect of budesonide on airways responsiveness to methacholine was lost after study medication washout, and there was no difference between groups in postbronchodilator FEV1. The CAMP data regarding the failure of asthma controller therapy to modify disease progression has prompted a shift in the field, with the most recent guidelines focusing on maximizing symptom control and quality of life rather than long-term disease remission.26\n",

The study consisted of 3 years of treatment with either budesonide or placebo, in addition to other usual asthma therapy, followed by a 2-year open-label period during which all participants received budesonide. In the double-blind phase, patients who received budesonide had a significant reduction in asthma exacerbations (OR, 0.57; P < .001), a longer time to first severe asthma-related event, and less of a decrease in prebronchodilator and postbronchodilator FEV1 values.27 During the open-label period, the original placebo group effectively \u201ccaught up\u201d to the budesonide group, so that there were no differences between the two groups in terms of asthma-related events, symptoms, activity restrictions, or sleep disturbances. However, patients in the placebo group required significantly more asthma medication than the budesonide group to reach the same level of asthma control during the open-label phase, indicating a potentially diminished response to ICSs when treatment is delayed. Results from the START study suggest that early intervention with ICSs will not affect lung function but may improve overall treatment effectiveness and reduce the need for additional medication to maintain asthma control.28\n",

In the Pediatric Asthma Controller Trial (PACT), which included 285 children with mild to moderate persistent asthma, ICS monotherapy was superior to both ICS/long-acting \u03b2-agonist (LABA) combination and montelukast over 48 weeks.30 A post hoc multivariate analysis of the PACT data found that factors associated with the best long-term outcomes with ICS therapy included a parental history of asthma, increased exhaled nitric oxide levels, marked airways hyperresponsiveness, or a history of ICS use. The investigators were unable to identify any factor that predicted a better response to montelukast compared with fluticasone.31 Similarly, in the Characterizing Response to Leukotriene Receptor Antagonist and Inhaled Corticosteroids (CLIC) study, which also compared ICS with leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA), 144 children ages 6 to 17 years with mild to moderate persistent asthma using only as-needed bronchodilators took fluticasone and montelukast, each for 8 weeks, in a crossover fashion. Fluticasone was superior to montelukast in asthma control days, Asthma Control Questionnaire scores, albuterol use, and pulmonary function measures. Baseline factors predicting a more favorable response to fluticasone included fewer asthma control days, higher exhaled nitric oxide levels, greater albuterol use, and more positive aeroallergen skin test responses (potentially reflective of a greater inflammatory component). Younger age and shorter duration of disease predicted a preferential response to montelukast.32\n",

Health care utilization in these patients was high, even though almost two-thirds of patients were using three or more long-term controller medications (Figure 5; available at www.jpeds.com). Assessment of age-associated and sex-associated differences revealed that height for age decreased across age groups, especially in females. In general, TENOR children and adolescents were shorter and heavier compared with national averages. Lung function (as FEV1 % predicted) decreased with increasing age. In boys, baseline prebronchodilator FEV1 % of predicted was 91 in the youngest age group (6 to 8 years) and 82 in the oldest age group (15 to 17 years); corresponding values in girls were 94 and 84, respectively.34\n",

The recently published Best Add-on Therapy Giving Effective Responses (BADGER) triple-crossover study assessed 182 children with uncontrolled asthma despite treatment with low-dose ICS (fluticasone 100 \u03bcg twice daily). The study compared three different step-up therapies: the addition of salmeterol 50 \u03bcg twice daily (LABA step-up), the addition of montelukast 5 to 10 mg daily (LTRA step-up), or an increase of fluticasone to 250 \u03bcg twice daily (ICS step-up). A differential response occurred in 98% of patients, with the best response occurring significantly more frequently with LABA step-up than with LTRA or ICS step-up. Better asthma control at baseline and lack of eczema were associated with a higher probability that LABA would be the best add-on therapy. In a secondary analysis, black patients were equally likely to have a best response to LABA or ICS step-up and were least likely to have a best response to LTRA step-up, whereas white patients were most likely to have a best response to LABA. The authors caution that the best overall performance of LABA therapy should be weighed against the potential increased risks of such therapy.35\n",
