Its pulmonary component is characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lung to noxious particles or gases\u201d.1 The general view of this disease is that it will become one of the major health challenges of the next few decades. Prevalence surveys suggest that up to almost a quarter of adults aged 40 years and older have mild airflow obstruction.2, 3, 4 COPD is presently the fourth leading cause of death, but WHO predicts that it will become the third leading cause by 2030;5 mortality owing to cardiac diseases and stroke decreased over the period 1970\u20132002, but that of COPD doubled over the same period.6\n",

In developing countries prevalence has risen strikingly, owing to increased smoking rates and reductions in other causes of death, particularly from severe infections. Worldwide prevalence of COPD of Global Initiative on Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage 2 or higher in adults aged 40 years and older is 9\u201310%.9 The Burden of Obstructive Lung Disease initiative2 used standardised methods to investigate the prevalence of COPD around the world and showed important differences between countries.

This method of assessment is simple, not tied to reference values derived from complex equations, enables comparison of prevalence estimates across sites, and can be easily understood by patients and the wider population. Four GOLD stages are distinguished on the basis of severity of airflow obstruction: stage 1 (mild, FEV1 \u226580% of predicted) stage 2 (moderate, FEV1 50\u201380% of predicted), stage 3 (severe, FEV1 30\u201350% of predicted), and stage 4 (very severe, FEV1 <30% of predicted).",

Moreover, although COPD has been typically seen in men, prevalence in women has risen because of the increasing number of those older than 50 years who smoke. For the first time in the USA, similar numbers of men and women died from COPD in the year 2000, although the mortality rate remains lower in women.13\n",

Remodelling of the small-airway compartment and loss of elastic recoil by emphysematous destruction of parenchyma result in progressive decline of FEV1, inadequate lung emptying on expiration, and subsequent static and dynamic hyperinflation.22 At the pathological level, exposure to smoke leads to infiltration of the mucosa, submucosa, and glandular tissue by inflammatory cells. Increased mucus content, epithelial-cell hyperplasia, and disturbed tissue repair with wall thickening in the small conducting airways are cardinal features of COPD (figure 1\n).23 This progressive narrowing, obliteration, and even removal of the terminal bronchioles is accompanied by emphysema, which typically starts in the respiratory bronchioles.24 The mechanisms that lead to thickening of the small-airway walls and destruction of lung tissue are far from understood,23 but they are likely to be multifactorial pathobiological processes25 that are interacting on a complex background of genetic determinants,26 lung growth,14 and environmental stimuli (figure 2\n).3, 13 Within this framework we discuss the pathogenesis of COPD as a progressive immunological disorder.27\n",

These signals are identified by pattern-recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors 4 and 2 on epithelial cells, and a non-specific inflammatory response is triggered.28 Upon the release of early cytokines (tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 and interleukins 1 and 8), macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells are recruited to the site of inflammation to orchestrate the innate immune response.29, 30 Proteolytic enzymes and reactive oxygen species are released and, if not sufficiently counterbalanced by antiproteases and antioxidant factors, further damage will occur.31 Immature dendritic cells pick up self-antigens released from damaged tissue and foreign antigens from incoming pathogens and present them to naive T cells in the draining lymph nodes.29 Once activated into T-helper-1 cells, these antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 cells and antibody-producing B cells are drawn to the lungs to neutralise the antigens. As the disease progresses, tertiary lymphoid aggregates, including an oligoclonal selection of the B and T cells involved, develop around the small airways.32, 33 Although the exact nature and function of these aggregates needs to be elucidated, adaptive or autoimmune responses are thought to perpetuate the inflammation years after smoking cessation.27, 34\n",

Tapering of the immune response by regulatory T cells protects against uncontrolled inflammation,35 and reduced populations of these cells have been seen in the lungs of patients with COPD.34, 36 By contrast, the numbers of proinflammatory T-helper-17 cells rise,37, 38 which suggests impaired immune regulation in COPD. Pulmonary emphysema and cellular ageing share some features:25, 39 senescence leads to cells becoming non-proliferative but metabolically active, which predisposes individuals to increased inflammation, reduced cell regeneration, and carcinogenesis. Cigarette smoke and oxidative stress promote senescence.40 As such, COPD can be interpreted as accelerated ageing of the lung, and hence age will increase susceptibility to COPD.41 Finally, cellular apoptosis and matrix destruction are continuously compensated for by cellular renewal and matrix repair to maintain lung homoeostasis.42 Resident stem cells within the lung are activated by epithelial damage43 but cigarette smoke limits alveolar repair44 and dysregulates repair processes involving transforming growth factor \u03b2, which leads to fibrosis.45 The underlying molecular signals are poorly understood, but in COPD repair mechanisms eventually fail.",

Concomitant infection with viruses and bacteria are seen in 25% of patients with exacerbations who are admitted to hospital.52 Viral exacerbations are strongly correlated with colds at presentation, high frequency of exacerbations, and severe respiratory symptoms during exacerbations. Mallia and co-workers70 used experimental rhinovirus infection in individuals with COPD and noted the development of lower-airway respiratory symptoms, airflow obstruction, systemic inflammation, and inflammation of the airways. A significant correlation was also seen between viral load and concentrations of inflammatory markers. These findings strongly support a causal relation between rhinovirus infection and COPD exacerbations. No diagnostic test is available for viral exacerbations of COPD. Increased concentrations of interferon-\u03b3-inducible protein 10 in serum was useful in one study to identify rhinovirus infection in patients with COPD.71 The presence of fever has also been associated with virus detection during exacerbations.72 Viral infections might facilitate subsequent bacterial infection or increases in the numbers of bacteria already colonising the lower airways. Although viral infection could be self-limiting, secondary bacterial infection might prolong exacerbations.70\n",

For instance, cigarette smoking is a major risk for COPD and cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and lung cancer.78 Abundant evidence shows that physical inactivity, which is frequently observed in people who develop COPD,79 is linked to the major comorbidities.80, 81 Finally, ageing is a major risk factor for chronic diseases. Almost half of all people aged 65 years or more have at least three chronic medical disorders,82 and for COPD in particular a cluster analysis indicated that age rather than FEV1 accounted for most of the comorbidities and symptoms.83\n",

The most important is probably whether bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, or both, modify the disease course. No direct evidence clearly shows a disease-modifying role, but circumstantial evidence is accumulating. Two large landmark trials have shown a trend for reduced mortality with fixed combinations96 and significantly reduced mortality was seen with a long-acting anti-cholinergic agent in two analyses, although this effect was not seen in a third analysis.97 A post-hoc analysis showed a significant reduction in the decline of FEV1, by 16 mL per year, with fixed combinations,114 and a prespecified subgroup analysis showed a reduction of 6 mL per year with a long-acting anticholinergic agent in patients with GOLD stage 2 COPD.115 In the latter analysis most of the patients in the control group were taking a combination of a long-acting \u03b22 agonists and an inhaled steroid and, therefore, these effects on annual rate of decline seem to be additive. Thus, with the appropriate combination of agents, tangible effects might be obtained. In a smaller subgroup of patients who took no maintenance medications at the beginning of the trial, tiotropium slowed the rate of decline in postbronchodilator FEV1 by 11 mL per year and of deterioration in health-related quality of life by two-thirds.116 Finally, safety data indicate that reductions in the incidence of respiratory failure and myocardial infarction as a serious adverse events have been seen with tiotropium.97\n",

Thus, how patients would move from GOLD stage 2 to 3, and further to 4, is hard to conceive. Several potential explanations for this pattern may be offered. First, patients who reach GOLD stages 3\u20134 have poor pulmonary function at diagnosis (lower intercept). For instance, patients who have low lung function at presentation because of genetic factors or exposure to environmental factors before age 4 years are at increased risk of developing chronic respiratory disease.4, 120 Second, patients who reach GOLD stages 3\u20134 also have a faster decline earlier in the disease course than patients in whom disease reaches less advanced stages.90, 115, 118 Finally, comorbidities of COPD arise in the early disease stages.73, 74 No randomised controlled trials have yet been done to investigate whether treatment with bronchodilators or inhaled corticosteroids reduces the prevalence or severity of comorbidities. Observational studies suggest that statins, \u03b2 blockers, and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors improve outcomes and survival,121, 122, 123 although these studies might be statistically flawed simply because of their observational nature.124\n",
