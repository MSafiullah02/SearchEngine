The envelope glycoprotein E2 gene of the CSFV is an immunoprotective antigen that induces the immune system to produce neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, it is essential to study the codon usage of the E2 gene of the CSFV. In this study, 140 coding sequences of the E2 gene were analyzed. The value of effective number of codons (ENC) showed low codon usage bias in the E2 gene. Our study showed that codon usage could be described mainly by mutation pressure ENC plot analysis combined with principal component analysis (PCA) and translational selection-correlation analysis between the general average hydropathicity (Gravy) and aromaticity (Aroma), and nucleotides at the third position of codons (A3s, T3s, G3s, C3s and GC3s). Furthermore, the neutrality analysis, which explained the relationship between GC12s and GC3s, revealed that natural selection had a key role compared with mutational bias during the evolution of the E2 gene. These results lay a foundation for further research on the molecular evolution of CSFV.",

Furthermore, it has been highlighted that an ENC value equal to or less than 35 is considered to be an extremely strong codon usage bias [26, 28] . To further determine the major factors affecting codon usage bias, an ENC-plot was generated which was completed with Graph Pad Prism6.0, with the ENC values plotted against the GC3s values. When the codon usage is only constrained by the GC3s, the observed ENC values will just lie on or around the standard curve. Otherwise, the observed values lying far lower than the standard curve, demonstrated that excepting for mutation pressure, other factors, such as natural selection, contribute to the codon usage pattern [27] .

The PCA results showed that among all the variations, the percentage of the first principal axis was 23.39% and the second axis, third axis and forth axis account for 19.03%, 14.05%, and 10.10% of all the variations (Fig 2) , respectively.

Therefore, a plot of the 1st axis and the 2nd axis of the isolated strains according to the geographical distribution was drawn (Fig 3) . This explained that the different isolated countries with CSFV are dispersed, and far away from the origin, confirming mutation pressure. Other factors also played a role in shaping the codon usage bias of the E2 gene of the CSFV (Fig 3A) . It is essential to denote that the majority of strains isolated from China were located near the origin, with only several China strains showing diversity, indicating that, compared with the other sixteen isolated countries, China strains contributed to mutation pressure to a large degree. Additionally, the majority of Asian strains were clustered together near the origin, suggesting that, compared with other strains, mutational bias was a major factor in shaping codon usage of the E2 gene of the CSFV Asian strains. The correlation analysis between the codon compositions and the 1st axis and 2nd axis signified the codon compositions that were significantly correlated with the 1st axis and 2nd axis Table 2 .

Previous studies indicated that, in the analysis of genomic sequencing, variations were frequently found in CSFV, 5'NTR, E2 and NS5B [43] [44] [45] . Additionally, the E2 glycoprotein is remarkable in affecting viral virulence and escaping immune responses [46] . However, the genetic bias of E2 glycoprotein in CSFV has not been studied. It has been previously shown that codon usage bias of vaccinated and non-vaccinated CSFV strains were different and the vaccination may influence the evolution of CSFV [47] . It is considered that codon usage bias of different species and different genes, even belonging to a virus, is different during evolution [48] [49] [50] . Additionally, the degree of codon usage is comprised of the following factors: mutation pressure, translational selection, the abundance of tRNAs, secondary mRNA structure, and gene length [10] . Two factors mainly affect codon usage; that is, mutation pressure and selection pressure [51, 52] . Further, in codon usage analysis on some DNA viruses and RNA viruses, mutational bias is a decisive factor compared with natural selection, such as the FMDV [53] and Tembusu virus [54] ; however, in the codon usage analysis on PEDV, it was revealed that natural selection dominates over mutation pressure [10] .",

It has been reported that ENC values of the complete genome of the CSFV ranged from 51.07 to 52.15, with a mean\u00b1SD of 51.7\u00b10.26 [55] , while the ENC values of E2 was wider, which might contribute to the characteristics of immunoprotective antigens.

Next, were A, G and U, while the nucleotide content analysis decrypted that among the four nucleotides, A%was the highest, which suggested that the nucleotide composition constrains synonymous codon usage of the E2 gene of the CSFV. Additionally, ENC-plot analysis (Fig 1) and PCA analysis (Fig 3) , based on the geographical distribution (isolated country and continent), were performed. Fig 1 shows that the value of each 140 independent strains was lower than the standard value, and strains isolated from three continents were clustered mainly in three groups, which was, according to the survey, that the prevalence of CSFV was mainly in Asian [57] and European [58] countries. The PCA analysis (Fig 3) demonstrated that the majority of Asian strains clustered near the origin, and European strains were disparate, which might be due to Asian countries being old epidemic areas, while European countries are actively prevalence areas. Then, the correlation between Aroma, Gravy and codon usage indices and among the 18 frequently used synonymous codons, 10 were commonly used in both CSFV and the viral host indicated the role of natural selection. The two main factors contributed to the codon usage of the E2 gene of the CSFV to different degrees. Thus, the neutrality analysis, GC3s plotted against GC12s, decrypted that GC3s had no correlation with GC12s. Furthermore, the extent of mutational bias occupied only 10.43%, and otherwise the translational selection was 89.57%, highlighting that in natural selection vs mutation pressure in shaping codon usage of the E2 gene of the CSFV, natural selection had a significant role.",
