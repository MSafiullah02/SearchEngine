            "text": "\nJapanese encephalitis has become a major cause of mortality and morbidity in wide areas of south and southeast Asia and kept in a zoonotic transmission cycle between pigs or birds and mosquitoes (Burke et al., 2001, Solomon et al., 2003, Tsai, 2000). JEV spreads to dead-end hosts, including humans, through the bite of JEV-infected mosquitoes and causes infection of the central nervous system, with a high mortality rate (Parida et al., 2006a). JEV targets the CNS, clinically manifesting with fever, headache, vomiting, signs of meningeal irritation, and altered consciousness, leading to high mortality and neurological sequelae in some of those who survive (Kumar et al., 1990). After entry into the host, JEV generates a rapid inflammatory response, including peripheral neutrophil leucocytosis or infiltration of neutrophils in extraneural tissue. Clinically, the infection of JEV results in increased levels of cytokines such as macrophage-derived chemotactic factor, TNF, and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (Khanna et al., 1991, Ravi et al., 1997, Singh et al., 2000). The increased levels of inflammatory mediators appear to play a protective role or initiate an irreversible immune response leading to cell death. Despite the fact that Japanese encephalitis is a major disease affecting the tropical world, little is known of its pathogenesis due, partly, to the lack of a suitable animal model and the complex cell interactions in infected individuals. JEV tends to cause a neurotrophic infection, attacking neural rather than non-neural tissues in humans. Experimental studies in rats have demonstrated that neuron cells, especially developing neurons are the major target cells for infection. The role that neurons play in the induction of the immune response following CNS viral infection is poorly understood, largely owing to the belief that these cells are immunologically quiescent. In order to understand the nature and consequence at the transcriptional level, we have carried out the microarray analysis of mock-infected and JE virus-infected murine neuroblastoma cells. The microarray data was validated with qRT-PCR experiments and time point analysis was done to demonstrate the induction of chemokine by JEV-infected neurons as an early defense mechanism. We employed mouse neuronal cells (N2A) as a model system because of the permissiveness of these cells to JEV infection (Murali-Krishna et al., 1995, Yang et al., 2004, Lin et al., 2004, Hong-Lin et al., 2002). In this study, we demonstrated that virus infection of neuronal cells results in the strong induction of proinflammatory chemokines along with robust anti-viral response. The replicating virus within the infected host neurons alters normal gene expression profiles, which can be of significance in JEV pathogenesis at the molecular level.",

Out of those six genes, five genes showed congruent and significant differences in expression, while one displayed opposite expression pattern (Table 5\n). Upregulated genes include CXCL1 (chemokine, C\u2013X\u2013C motif, ligand 1), CXCL10 (chemokine, C\u2013X\u2013C motif, ligand 10), Itgb (integrin beta), and CD 40 (CD40 ligand). downregulated genes include Xcr1 (chemokine, C motif receptor 1). However, the qRT-PCR showed greater dynamism in fold changes than the microarray results because of the greater sensitivity of PCR compared with fluorescent detection in microarray experiment.",

CXCL10 is found to be a crucial molecule governing the protective response against various diseases like dengue, Trypanosoma cruzi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, rabies virus and corona virus infection of the CNS by enhancing innate immune responses (Hsieh et al., 2006, Hardison et al., 2006). IP-10 is an essential component in host defense by coordinating the trafficking of Th1 T lymphocytes into the CNS in response to viral infection. We demonstrated the strong induction of CXCL10 by infected neurons itself. The qRT-PCR analysis showed sustained induction of CXCL10 in JEV-infected mouse neuroblastoma cells. The results indicate that neurons may be a source of chemokine synthesis for primary anti-viral response in JE infection (Fig. 3B). There is gradual decrease in CXCL10 expression with increased viral load in cells, suggesting its anti-viral role in JE infection. No significant fold change was detected for other chemoattractant like CXCL11 and CXCL9 (Fig. 3A\u2013C).",

Ccl5\u2013Ccr5 interaction provides anti-apoptotic signals for macrophage survival during viral infection. Ccl5-responsive genes comprise a significant number of enzymes, transcription factors, and miscellaneous molecules involved in neuronal survival and differentiation, including neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis (Valerio et al., 2004). There was significant upregulation of a number of ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system related genes such as Usp18 during JE virus replication but it was unclear if this response was anti-viral or if the JE virus utilized components of the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system for its replication. We found significant upregulation in anti-viral response genes like IFN induced Isg15, Viperin, Mx 2, anti-viral genes like oligoadenylate synthetase, Parp14, Irgm, transcription factor-like STAT and ER stress regulated genes like Herpud1, ATF6 and XBP1. The marked elevation in expression of these genes at 36 h post-infection suggests a highly notable anti-viral response to JEV pathogenesis.",

Specific components of the response to virus such as Viperin, G1p2, Ifit3, Atf3, Irgm and CXCL10 have been implicated in JE infection for the first time to the best of our knowledge. Future research is required to explore the mechanism of JEV modulation of these genes to evade the host defense response. Our study offers an overview of the cascade of changes in host cellular expression culminating from infection with JEV. The counterbalancing of several anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory pathways together with the variable expression of apoptosis-related genes is a significant finding of the present study. The involvement of these genes indicated modulation of initial host cell response and balance between cell proliferation and cell death there by enabling virus multiplication. The emerging picture from this study implicates a central role for the immune response in the pathobiology of JE infection. It will be interesting to compare the host response to different JEV isolates with inactivated preparations of the virus.",
