In October 2009, GiViTI set up the A(H1N1) registry with the following aims: to describe the epidemiology of the phenomenon in Italy and compare it with other international surveys; to assess the impact of the pandemic on the work of Italian ICUs; to assess whether a patient with A(H1N1) pneumonia had a different risk of death from a patient with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) of different origin.",

The core data of the Margherita Project included demographics, admission diagnoses, severity of infection on admission, comorbidities, where the patient had been before admission, surgical status, reasons for admission, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) variables [18], failures and diseases while in the ICU, maximum severity of infection, major procedures and interventions, ICU and hospital outcomes. Additional variables were collected in the A(H1N1) registry on onset of influenza symptoms, vaccination, risk factors for severe infection, polymerase chain reaction-confirmed diagnosis, worst PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and specific treatments during the ICU stay. We were careful to spot patients transferred from one ICU to another, so as to count them only once. We only considered the outcome at the final ICU destination.",

We also included a variable identifying the seasonal influenza period of each year, as reported by the permanent influenza surveillance program of the Italian Ministry of Health (http://www.iss.it/iflu/, see ESM). There were 47 potential prognostic factors tested in the model. We tested the assumption that the logit was linear in the quantitative variables by analyzing the estimated coefficients of designed variables representing the quartiles of the original variable distribution [19]. Whenever suggested by this analysis, we tested a second-order model or log transformation of the variable. If these approaches failed to fit the data, the variable was divided into classes, and dummy variables were used [19]. After forcing the inclusion of both A(H1N1) infection and influenza period in the model, step by step we added the covariate that maximized the increment in likelihood, in a forward approach.

In the absence of detailed information, we cannot ascribe the increase in ICU admissions at the beginning of 2009 to seasonal influenza. In other words, we cannot state that patients with 2009 seasonal influenza were more prevalent in the ICUs than those with A(H1N1) influenza, at their corresponding peaks. Nevertheless, on comparing the density of CAP per 1,000 ICU beds in the last 7 years (Fig. 3) with the incidence of seasonal influenza provided by the Ministry of Heath (see ESM) the two phenomena are seen to clearly overlap. This suggests that at least the peak in ICU CAP may be related to seasonal influenza. At any rate, the observation that the Italian ICUs were not overcrowded during the A(H1N1) influenza outbreak, proves that the ICU system, which already has very high occupancy rates, was able to absorb the H1N1 wave without additional workload. However, we do not know whether this was achieved by transferring critically ill patients, delaying elective surgery, or by other strategies. Only the Australian\u2013New Zealand study provided the percentages of ICU beds occupied by A(H1N1) patients (on average 5.2% over the 3-month period), but did not make any comparison with previous periods [13].",

Moreover, different ways of calculating the CFR lead to very different results [8, 22].

This assesses whether patients with A(H1N1)-related CAP were at higher risk of death than those with CAP of different etiology. In Italy, on account of the limited numbers of ICU beds, admission criteria are quite strict, selecting CAP patients who mostly need ventilatory support, often have severe sepsis or septic shock, and are thus a high risk of mortality (Table 3).",

In the right-hand column, the H1N1 OR is adjusted by the variable specified in the corresponding row plus all the variables listed before, in a multivariate model. Hence, for example, the third row of the left column gives the odds ratio of H1N1 after adjustment for severity of infection; the same row on the right gives the odds ratio of H1N1 after adjustment for severity of infection, length of stay (LOS) before ICU admission, and SAPS II.
