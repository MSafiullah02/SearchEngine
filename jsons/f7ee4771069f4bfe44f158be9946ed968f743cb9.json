Since then, our understanding of how ubiquitin is fundamental to maintain cell homeostasis has exponentially increased. It has become clear that the ubiquitin system is far more than just a system to control protein homeostasis through protein degradation and that it is fundamental for the control of signalling pathways such as DNA repair, receptor trafficking to the plasma membrane and immune signalling [1, 2] . The discovery of a wide variety of polyubiquitin chains, including phosphorylated ubiquitin and how each of these controls different protein fates, has uncovered the great complexity of this system.",

The initiation of inflammation leads to the activation of the innate immune response, as a first line of defence, followed by the adaptive immune response, with the ultimate goal of removing the threat, promoting tissue repair and restoring health. Although inflammation is a beneficial process in life, its deregulation can lead to chronic inflammation that results in the initiation and progression of disease [2] . It is therefore necessary that initiation and progression of the inflammatory response are tightly regulated at different levels, and this is achieved amongst other things through PTMs such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination [3] .",

Inflammasomes form when cells such as macrophages encounter danger signals, either derived from tissue damage, such as extracellular ATP, or infection, such as bacterial toxins. Assembly of these complexes leads to the activation of the protease caspase-1 which triggers the processing and release of the active forms of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1b and IL-18, and a process of cell death called pyroptosis [4] . The ability to sense and respond to danger appropriately is critical for maintaining immune homeostasis. Dysregulation of inflammasomes contributes to the progression of many chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and rheumatoid arthritis; hence, it is critical that inflammasome activation is tightly regulated [4] .",

First, the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme and ubiquitin form a thioester bond that is then transferred to an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme forming an ubiquitin-thioester intermediate that is finally transferred to the substrate protein by an E3 ubiquitin ligase [5] (Fig. 1A) . While the E1 and E2 families have around 2 and 40 members, respectively ( [6] , the E3 ubiquitin ligase family is formed by around 600 members that can be grouped in three major classes: (a) RING (really interesting new gene) domain-containing and U-box-containing E3s, which function as scaffolds for E2 enzymes; (b) HECT (homologous to the E6-associated protein C terminus) domain-containing E3s, which form a thiol ester bond with ubiquitin before conjugation to the substrate; and (c) RBR (RING1-between-RING2) E3s, which function as hybrids of RING and HECT E3s [7] .",

Ubiquitination can occur just in one residue (monoubiquitination) and occur repeatedly in the same protein at different sites (multi-monoubiquitination) or at the same site (polyubiquitination). In this case, the first ubiquitin serves as the acceptor of additional ubiquitins that conjugate to each other at any one of their lysine residues (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, K63 or methionine 1 (M1, linear chains)) [5] (Fig. 1Bi,ii) . In addition to these eight different types of polyubiquitin chains (poly-Ub), ubiquitin (Ub) can also form hybrid polyubiquitin chains, where additional ubiquitins conjugate to each other through any of their different K residues (Fig. 1Biii) . It is also worth noting that noncanonical ubiquitination of residues other than lysine, such as serine or threonine, can also occur, although this type of ubiquitination is not yet well understood [8] . An even higher level of complexity has been uncovered by recent discoveries showing that ubiquitin and members of the ubiquitin system can be modified by PTMs such as phosphorylation, acetylation or deamidation [9] .",

First, there is a priming step that involves activation of the NF-kB pathway usually by TLR engagement (signal 1) and leads to the upregulation of some of the inflammasome components such as NLRP3 and proIL-1b. This is followed by an activation step, where the cells sense DAMPs or MAMPs (signal 2) that results in the assembly and oligomerization of the inflammasome complex, the activation of caspase-1 and the consequent cleavage, activation and release of IL-1b and IL-18. Step 2 is characterized by the induction of potassium efflux [17] . Inflammasome activation also leads to a process of cell death called pyroptosis mainly mediated by the pore-forming protein gasdermin-D upon its cleavage by caspase-1 [18, 19] (Fig. 2) . It was recently showed that signal 1 also has a nontranscriptional component and that if NLRP3 is already present in a cell, short-term priming with a TLR agonist is enough to render an active inflammasome upon signal 2 independent of transcription [20] .",

One major way of achieving this is by controlling NLRP3 levels by the proteasome or autophagy degradation pathways. TRIM31 has been shown to directly bind to NLRP3, inducing K48 poly-Ub that leads to proteasomal degradation of the NLRP3 [26] . The E3 ligase SCF-FBXL2 also contributes to NLRP3 regulation [27] . SCF-FBXL2 ubiquitinates NLRP3 in the resting state and hence contributes to its degradation by the proteasome. However, upon LPS sensing (signal 1), the levels of the E3 ligase FBXO3 that ubiquitinates FBXL2 and targets it to proteasomal degradation increase. This consequently reduces FBXL2 levels leading to an increase in NLRP3 expression and therefore increased inflammasome activation. Although no direct link to a particular E3 has been yet been established, it has been shown that cigarette smoke induces NLRP3 ubiquitination leading to its proteasomal degradation [28] . Similarly, Filardy et al. [29] showed that murine colonic macrophages express much lower levels of NLRP3 protein compared to bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM), despite levels of mRNA being much higher. This is due to basal NLRP3 levels being controlled by the proteasome since treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 increased NLRP3 expression to levels equivalent to those seen in BMDMs. They also showed that blocking IL-10R in these macrophages restored NLRP3 levels, implying that IL-10 plays a role in such proteasomal control of NLRP3 inflammasome. This would provide a mechanism for other studies showing that IL-10 negatively regulates the NLRP3 inflammasome [30] .",

Inflammasome needs a priming signal (signal 1) such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that triggers the NF-KB pathway leading to an increase in the production of proIL-1b and NLRP3. A second signal, named activation signal (signal 2), is triggered after the recognition of MAMPs and DAMPs through specific receptors such as the purinergic receptor P2X7 that sense extracellular ATP, membrane disruption by bacterial toxins or lysosomal uptake of particulate matter such as monosodium urate crystals. This activating signal triggers a disruption of cell homeostasis that results in increased potassium efflux. This potassium efflux is sensed by the cytosolic receptor NLRP3 that in turn oligomerizes and forms the active complex of the inflammasome after recruitment of ASC and caspase-1. The active inflammasome will cleave procaspase-1 generating active caspase-1 which will lead to the cleavage and the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b and IL-18. Caspase-1 will also cleave gasdermin-D and that will result in the creation of pores in the membrane. These pores are suggested to be one mechanism of release for IL-18 and IL-1b.

This E3 ligase plays a dual role in NLRP3 regulation. First, it interacts with NLRP3 during the LPS-priming phase facilitating NLRP3 K63 polyubiquitination, a step Fig. 3 . Regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome by the ubiquitin system. The ubiquitin system contributes to both negative (i) and positive (ii) regulation of NLRP3. (i) E3 ligases such as FBXL2, PARKIN, TRIM31 or MARCH7 have been identified as negative regulators of the inflammasome by controlling its protein levels by either proteasome or autophagy pathways. Upon sensing inflammasome-priming signals (signal 1), ARIH2 and Cullin1 bind and ubiquitinate NLRP3 to maintain it in an inactive state, which prevents its assembly and inflammasome activation. Upon sensing activating signals (signal 2), they dissociate from NLRP3 reducing its ubiquitination and allowing for the formation of an active inflammasome. The deubiquitinase A20 also contributes to a negative regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. (ii).

In addition, the authors found that Pellino2 also ubiquitinates IRAK1 and limits its interaction with NLRP3 and consequently the ability of IRAK1 to inhibit NLRP3. In Pellino2-deficient macrophages, this effect is lost, and IRAK1 mediates its blocking effect on NLRP3 activation [37] .",

However, when they analysed inflammasome activation in SHARPIN-deficient bone marrowderived macrophages, they observed a reduction in inflammasome activation compared with WT [51] . These results fit with that described by Gurung et al. [48] and highlight the fact that the same protein might be having different roles depending on the cell type.

Involvement of DUBs as positive regulators of NLRP3 inflammasome was first identified when different DUB inhibitors G5, PR619, bAP15 and WP1130 were shown to block NLRP3-induced caspase-1 activation and IL-1b release [20, 53] . This was quickly followed by the work of Py et al. [54] , who showed that BRCC3, a JAB1/MPN/Mov34 (JAMM) domain-containing Zn 2+ metalloprotease DUB that forms part of the BRCC36 isopeptidase complex (BRISC) which specifically recognizes K63polyubiquitin chains, was required for NLRP3 activation. This work suggested that BRCC3 directly interacted with NLRP3, and its presence was required for appropriate NLRP3 inflammasome formation. Recently, Ren et al. [55] showed that ABRO1, another component of BRISC, is required for optimal NLRP3 activation and that ABRO1-deficient mice have impaired NLRP3 inflammasome responses. ABRO1 interacts with NLRP3 and promotes its deubiquitination allowing the formation of an active inflammasome complex. ABRO1 acts as a scaffold for the interaction of NLRP3 with BRCC3 and synergizes with BRCC3 to promote NLRP3 inflammasome activation by regulating NLRP3 deubiquitination. Furthermore, ABRO1 can deubiquitinate NLRP3 holding one of the mutations (A350V) that lead to its autoactivation and to Muckle-Wells syndrome, one the autoinflammatory CAPS (cryopirin-associated periodic syndromes) [56] . This suggests that blockade of ABRO1/BRCC3 activity could prevent inflammasome activation in these patients.",

[60] showed that mice deficient in A20 (A20 myel-KO ), which is a rheumatoid arthritis (RA) susceptibility gene, develop a spontaneous erosive polyarthritis that resembles rheumatoid arthritis in patients. This RA in mice was dependent on NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1R signalling since A20-deficient macrophages presented enhanced NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1 activation, and IL-1b processing and release. This work showed a role for A20 in the regulation of the inflammasome independent of its role in the priming step. The control of the inflammasome by A20 is not just limited to macrophages. Mice with microglia-specific A20 deletion (A20 Cx3Cr1 KO ) present impaired microglial regulation and synaptic function. Injection of these mice with a sublethal LPS doses, known to induce neuroinflammation through microglia activation and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, led to severe hypothermia and increased mortality, compared to controls. This exacerbated inflammatory response was due to increased microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1b release [61] .",

A20 associates with caspase-1 and proIL-1b in response to signal 1 (LPS), and NLRP3 activation by signal 2 further promotes these interactions preventing inflammasome activation. The authors showed that proIL-1b interacts not only with caspase-1 and A20, but also with caspase-8, RIPK3 and RIPK1. This complex is associated with K63 polyubiquitination which increases in the absence of A20 in a RIPK3 manner. Finally, the authors showed that proIL-1b itself is ubiquitinated at K133 and that this ubiquitination is required for cleavage [59] . This suggests that decrease in proIL-1b ubiquitination by A20 prevents its cleavage explaining why in A20-deficient cells there is an increased IL-1b release.",

Further studies on BMDMs further revealed that IL-1b release was mediated by RIPK3-dependent cell death (necroptosis) and that ZnF7 is critical for this function as LPS stimulation of BMDMs from mice with a mutated ZnF7 domain (A20 mZnF7/mZnF7 ) also induces the release of processed IL-1b (although at lower levels compared with A20-knockout cells) [63] .",

The authors proposed that HDAC6 negatively regulates the NLRP3 inflammasome through its interaction with ubiquitinated NLRP3 and independently of its deacetylase activity [64] and that DUBs would be required to reduce this interaction and hence allow inflammasome activation. HDAC6 roles independent of its deacetylase activity have been described, one of them being ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation by either the proteasome or autophagy [65] . It is then possible that HDAC6 regulates NLRP3 by inducing its degradation by one of these mechanisms although this was not investigated in this study.",

However, based on its predicted structure, USP50 is considered catalytically inactive because it lacks one of the canonical residues involved in catalysis [67] .

Firstly, NLRP1 presents its CARD on the C terminus, and secondly, it presents a FIIND (function-to-find domain) which undergoes constitutive self-cleavage that results in two polypeptides that associate in a noncovalent manner and that are required for inflammasome formation [69] . The range of stimuli that trigger NLRP1 activation is limited, with the best characterized being anthrax lethal toxin (Le-Tx). Although processing of the NLRP1 N termini by Le-Tx was known for a while, it was only recently that the mechanism of activation of NLRP1 has been revealed as a proteasome-dependent process also described as 'functional degradation' [69] . Le-Tx directly cleaves NLRP1 inducing the degradation of the NLRP1 N terminus polypeptide (based on the Nend rule [70] ) freeing the NLRP1 C terminus polypeptide that contains the CARD domain to oligomerize, recruiting and activating caspase-1 [71, 72] . This work was followed by the work of Xu et al., where they identified the N-end rule ubiquitin ligase UBR2 as the one ubiquitinating NLRP1B to target it for proteasomal degradation in response to Le-Tx [73] . In addition to the N-end rule, it was also discovered that this mechanisms of activation is not just limited to proteases and that other effectors that promote NLRP1 proteasomal degradation of the N terminus, such as Shigella E3 ligase IpaH7.8 or inhibition of serine dipeptidase DPP8 and DPP9, also lead to NLRP1 inflammasome activation [71, 72] . What regulates NLRP1 self-cleavage remains unknown.",

A20 can deubiquitinate proIL-1b hence preventing its activation and adding to the negative regulatory role of this DUB. ProIL-1b ubiquitination might support its cleavage by encouraging higher order oligomerization of inflammasome components [59] . In line with this work, Zhang et al. [81] have shown that POH1, a DUB that forms part of the 19S subunit of the proteasome, interacts with and deubiquitinates proIL-1b by decreasing the K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, as well as decreasing the efficacy of proIL-1b cleavage. This supports the need of proIL-1b polyubiquitination for caspase-1-mediated cleavage.",

In the last few years, we have seen much progress in our understanding of how ubiquitin controls inflammasome activation, in particular the NLRP3 inflammasome. Mechanistic insight has come from in vitro and in vivo studies taking advantage of the use of cellular and mouse models deficient in particular components of the ubiquitin system, as well as of the increasing availability of tools such as selective ubiquitin chain antibodies, tandem ubiquitinbinding entities or activity-based ubiquitin probes [82] . However, we still lack crucial knowledge on several issues. For instance, we do not understand how different poly-Ub chains contribute to NLRP3 conformational changes that shift it to an active state and how deubiquitination of this receptor does allow for inflammasome assembly. Similarly, we do not understand how ubiquitin contributes to the activation of the noncanonical or alternative NLRP3 activation pathways.",

It is then possible that other members of the ubiquitin system are also regulated by inflammasome activation, modulating not only inflammasome activity but a wider aspect of the inflammatory response. For instance, the DUBs USP10 and VCIP135 have been identified as Interleukin-1b (IL-1b) and its ability to be processed by the inflammasome are controlled by the ubiquitin system. ProIL-1b levels are regulated by the proteasome after its ubiquitination by the E2-conjugating enzyme UBE2L3. K63 polyubiquitination of proIL-1b at K133 is required for its processing by caspase-1. Deubiquitination by DUBs POH1 and A20 prevents its activation, independently of degradation.",

These result in manipulation of the host ubiquitin system by the pathogen as a mechanism for pathogens to escape from or delay the effects of the inflammatory response. This also includes control of inflammasome activation [88, 89] . Despite the importance of the noncanonical NLRP3, NLRC4 and AIM2 inflammasomes in responses to infection, very little is known about how pathogens and the ubiquitin system control activation of these inflammasomes and this could constitute a potential area of future research [90] . Targeting the ubiquitin system for therapeutic purposes is of great interest, in particular after the success of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in myeloma treatment [91] . However, there is still much we need to learn about the ubiquitin system before we can successfully target it to treat inflammatory disease. We need to better understand how E1-E2-E3 and DUBs are regulated, especially when present in protein complexes whose composition can vary depending on their location in the cell, cell type or in response to different cellular challenges, for example in disease or during ageing [92] . Hence, understanding the spatial-temporal regulation of these enzymes in health and disease is key, especially if we want to target these in the future. Finally, there are still many DUBs whose function is unknown and new ones that have just been discovered. This highlights how this is an area of research that is still growing and that there are exciting times ahead for new discoveries on the ubiquitin system.",

Ubiquitin is then transferred to an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme forming an ubiquitin-thioester intermediate that is finally transferred to the substrate protein by an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Deubiquitinase enzymes (DUBs) remove or edit ubiquitin chains from the substrate protein completing the circle of the ubiquitination system. (B) Different types of substrate modification by ubiquitin. Substrates proteins can be (i) by just one ubiquitin either just once or repeatedly in the same protein at different sites (monoubiquitination); (ii) at the same site repeatedly (polyubiquitination). Homogeneous polyubiquitination occurs when the first ubiquitin serves as the acceptor of additional ubiquitins that are conjugated to each other at the very same lysine residue each time (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, K63 or M1). (iii) Mixed polyubiquitination occurs when additional ubiquitins are conjugated to each other through any of their different lysines.",

Inflammasome needs a priming signal (signal 1) such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that triggers the NF-KB pathway leading to an increase in the production of proIL-1b and NLRP3. A second signal, named activation signal (signal 2), is triggered after the recognition of MAMPs and DAMPs through specific receptors such as the purinergic receptor P2X7 that sense extracellular ATP, membrane disruption by bacterial toxins or lysosomal uptake of particulate matter such as monosodium urate crystals. This activating signal triggers a disruption of cell homeostasis that results in increased potassium efflux. This potassium efflux is sensed by the cytosolic receptor NLRP3 that in turn oligomerizes and forms the active complex of the inflammasome after recruitment of ASC and caspase-1. The active inflammasome will cleave procaspase-1 generating active caspase-1 which will lead to the cleavage and the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b and IL-18. Caspase-1 will also cleave gasdermin-D and that will result in the creation of pores in the membrane. These pores are suggested to be one mechanism of release for IL-18 and IL-1b. The gasdermin-D pore also contributes to pro-inflammatory cell death known as pyroptosis.",
