Among the biomaterials, membranes have been a center of the various functions delimiting living cells. The membranes play a role in the interactions involving cell-surface glycoprotein, which mediate many biological communications and recognition processes [8].",

            "text": "Recently, there have been various works related to the applications aforementioned by using polymer colloids, since they possess extremely large surface area to guarantee high sensitivity. Colloid-based separation and sensor engineering seems to be very effective, for example, purification of specific protein from a crude biological mixture by either electrostatic interaction or specific ligand\u2013protein interactions, antigen\u2013antibody, DNA\u2013complimentary DNA, and carbohydrate\u2013carbohydrate binding protein [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. Chern et al. reported adsorption of Concanavalin A (Con A) onto dextran (glucose)-modified PMMA latex particles and charge neutralization due to Con A adsorption [17], [18]; however, the interaction between Con A and the glucose-modified PMMA latex is believed to be complicated and unclear due to the immobilization of glucose done by mere physical absorption. On the other hand, Koch and Yaacoub studied kinetics of emulsion polymerization of sugar-modified monomer, 3-O-methacryloyl-1,2:5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-\u03b1-d-glucofuranose, and properties of the sugar latex [19] where the sugar could be chemically adsorbed on to the latex surface and avoid any complex effect of dissolved glucose solution to Con A. As mentioned above, carbohydrate-based biosensors can be utilized to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) viruses [20]. Avian influenza viruses can bind to cell-surface of the glycoproteins or glycolipds containing carbohydrate, which can be similarly recognized by detection of specific proteins with sugar-modified latex.",

The detailed procedure is as follows: 2 g glucose was dissolved in a mixture of 17.4 g pyridine and 11.3 g acetic anhydride. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 6 h to obtain a clear solution. Afterwards, the reaction mixture was poured into the iced water, extracted with ethyl acetate, and washed with a mixture solution of 1N hydrochloric acid, aqueous sodium chloride, and water, and then dried over magnesium sulfate anhydrous. After washing, it was filtered to remove magnesium sulfate and volatile solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. As a result, \u03b1,\u03b2-mixture of peracetylated glucose was quantitative. Afterwards, 1 g peracetylated glucose was dissolved in 4 mL dry dichloromethane with 1.48 g allyl alcohol, and then 0.72 g boron trifluoride etherate was added to the round flask. The reaction was continued at 40 \u00b0C until the reaction completed, which was confirmed by thin layer chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate = 5:4). The collected mixture was poured into the water, and extracted with dichloromethane. The collected dichloromethane solutions were washed several times with aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate, dried, filtered, and then evaporated under reduced pressure. The product was fractionated by using chromatographic method (SiO2; hexane:ethyl acetate = 5:4) to obtain allyl 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-\u03b1-d-glucopyranose as a syrup. This product was dissolved in methanol with sodium methoxide, and stirred, until the starting material had been consumed (t.l.c; ethyl acetate). Finally, the product was neutralized with Amberlite IR-H+ resin, filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure.",

Colloidal instability of the latex was observed when the latex was diluted with PBS solution due to the presence of salts. As seen in Fig. 2(b), the SEM photo shows the coagulation of colloids as compared with Fig. 2(a). When Con A concentration was 0.1 and 0.4 \u03bcg/mL Con A (50 \u03bcL) to the above 0.02 wt% (0.5 mL) mixture, the mixtures increased the degree of coagulation. Scheme 3\nshows the schematic agglutination process due to the interaction between the glucose-modified latex and Con A. As seen in Scheme 3, Con A molecules in the PBS solution are forming tetramer structure at pH 7.2. Therefore, this Con A aggregate has at least four binding sites to coagulate the glucose-modified latex. Fig. 2 shows the effect of Con A concentration on the colloid stability of the latex, after incubating and evaporating for 6 h. There is a stability on the latex with various concentrations of the Con A which was directly observed by \u03b6-potential values. The Con A concentration decreased the stability of colloids because of the attachment of the Con A onto the surface of colloids. Decrease in the stability of colloids may be due to the charge neutralization of these negatively charged colloids induced by adsorption of the charged Con A. At pH 7.2, however, Con A is the isoelectric point (pI), i.e. electrically neutral. Therefore, this suggests that the coagulation of the latex particle should be achieved not by charge neutralization but by binding of Con A among the latex particles containing allyl-\u03b1-d-glucopyranose. As can be seen in Fig. 3\n, \u03b6-potential of the latex decreased as the concentration of Con A increased. This can be explained by the decrease in mobility due to the attachment of Con A, which shows electrically neutral and large size, ca. 3\u20136 nm [29]. When the glucose-modified latex particle meets Con A, Con A binds with allyl-\u03b1-d-glucopyranose and the latex would be covered with Con A, so particle becomes bigger and charge density decreased consequently. Aforementioned, these \u03b6 data imply that the coagulation kinetics is predominantly governed by the decrease in the electrical repulsion due to binding of Con A and followed by the agglutination of Con A-binded latex particles, whose behavior is totally different with the case of salt addition, as seen in Fig. 2(b and c).",

The stability of colloid was influenced by synergetic effects of electrostatic mechanisms. Con A diffused among of latex was observed by absorbance at 540 nm. The diffusion rate of Con A was measured by UV-intensity as a function of time. Fig. 4\nshows that Con A was dispersed in 0.02 wt% solid contents of the colloid with various concentrations. Its data was a general feature of the kinetic of coagulation. This result indicates that the dimension of the coagulated colloids continues to build up as the precipitation process proceeds. According to Fuchs, the stability ratio (W) is defined as the ratio K\nR/K\nS, where K\nR and K\nS are the fast coagulation and slow coagulation rate constants, respectively. As the method of Chern's analysis [17], the value of W for the colloids sample at concentration of Con A = 1 \u03bcg/mL can be estimated as the ratio of the asymptotic slope of the absorbance versus time curve at t\n = 0 (initial slope as concentration of Con A \u2192 20 \u03bcg/mL) to the slope of the absorbance versus time curve at t\n = 0 (initial slope at concentration of Con A \u2192 1 \u03bcg/mL). This is because K\nR or K\nS is proportional to the initial slope of the absorbance versus time curve. The log \nW versus log \nC (concentration of Con A) diagram for the modified colloids is shown in Fig. 5\n. The inflection point in the log \nW versus log \nC diagram is identified as the critical coagulation concentration of glucose-modified latex with addition of Con A. The formation of a cross-linked network structure by coagulation between the tetra-Con A and glucose active sites absorbed latex enhances the coagulation rate [30], [31].",
