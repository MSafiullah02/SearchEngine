Here, we develop a cell type-specific delivery system, based on vesicular stomatitis virus lacking the viral fusion protein (fusogen) and pseudotyped with AFF-1, a C. elegans cell-to-cell bilateral fusogen from the fusexin family. Following injection of AFF-1-coated virus into the C. elegans pseudocoelom that functions as a circulatory system, we observe specific infection of different cells that express EFF-1 or AFF-1 fusogens. EFF-1-expressing epidermal cells are preferentially infected, whereas mononucleated body wall muscles (BWMs) that do not express any fusogen are rarely infected. The epidermal cells infection is abolished when the host cells do not express EFF-1, while ectopic expression of EFF-1 on BWMs induces their abnormal cell-cell fusion, produces paralyzed-dumpy animals and enhances muscle infection by AFF-1-coated viruses. Thus, our data uncover that AFF-1-coated pseudotyped viruses can be retargeted to desired cells in a controlled manner and serve as a cell-specific delivery system in nematodes with potential applications in regenerative processes, therapies such as dendritic reconnection following injuries, and studies of diverse cellular and viral fusogens.",

EFF-1 and AFF-1 also participate in maintaining neuronal architecture and neuronal reconnection following injury [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Studied viral glycoproteins, including VSV-G, use a unilateral fusion mechanism that depends on the expression of receptors only on the target cells [28, 29] . In contrast, EFF-1 and AFF-1 are bilateral fusogens-their presence is required on the membranes of both apposing cells to mediate fusion [6, 16, 18, 30, 31] . These two fusogens can act in either a homotypic or a heterotypic manner [6, 16, 18, 21] and mediate heterotypic cell fusion of Sf9 insect and Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK) cells [6,16]. Finally, VSV viruses containing a GFP substituting the VSV-G coding sequence (VSV\u2206G) [32,33] that are coated with AFF-1 (VSV\u2206G-AFF-1) specifically infect AFF-1 or EFF-1 expressing BHK cells [6]. Thus, in contrast to the pseudotyped virus coated with the native, unilateral G glycoprotein (VSV\u0394G-G), infection by VSV\u0394G-AFF-1 requires fusogen expression on the host cell membrane. To date, however, VSV\u0394G coated with AFF-1, EFF-1 or any other non-viral fusogen have not been tested for infection in a living organism so far. Recently VSV\u0394G-G was demonstrated to infect living C. elegans [7,34]. Given that: (i) VSV\u0394G-AFF-1 requires a fusogen on the target cell for infection, (ii) a detailed cellular atlas of AFF-1 and EFF-1 expression and function in C.",

We find that AFF-1-coated viruses infect C. elegans and specifically target cells that express functional EFF-1 or AFF-1. Moreover, this infection increases with the dosage of active eff-1 conditionally expressed in the worm. Furthermore, AFF-1-coated pseudoviruses can be redirected to mononucleated BWMs that ectopically express EFF-1 inducing their merger to form nonfunctional syncytial muscle fibers. Therefore, VSV\u0394G-AFF-1 can serve as a cell-specific, inducible delivery system in C. elegans. Based on our results, we suggest additional applications for VSV\u0394G-AFF-1 including finding new fusogens and fusogen-expressing tissues, studying fusogen-fusogen interactions and fusogen-interacting proteins in vivo, studying neuronal regeneration processes and using specific cell-delivery approaches for other viruses such as coronaviruses and retroviruses in different organisms.",

VSV utilizes its surface glycoprotein G (VSV-G) to infect vertebrates and invertebrates and lyses many cell lines tested to date [1] [2] [3] . VSV is widely used for pseudotyping other viruses and has a high transduction efficiency [1] [2] [3] [4] . These properties turned VSV\u0394G into a promising vector for gene therapy, tissue regeneration, viral-based oncolysis, and VSV-based vaccines, some of which successfully completed phase III clinical trials [1, 5] . Moreover, VSV-based vectors are useful for studying mechanisms of transcription and replication of RNA viruses, cellular trafficking, antiviral responses and fusion proteins (fusogens) [6] [7] [8] [9] . However, the major bottleneck for both applied and fundamental research purposes is achieving an efficient and specific targeting of VSV-based vectors into desired cells/tissues of a live, multicellular organism [3] . Like other viruses, VSV lacks specificity for desired target cells as it suggestively enters cells through highly ubiquitous receptors such as the LDL receptor [10] . Retargeting VSV into particular tissues of interest therefore requires blocking the virus' natural interactions providing new, cell-specific interactions. Indeed, mutation or substitution of VSV-G with glycoproteins from other viruses or chimeric glycoproteins coupled with antibodies can retarget VSV to specific cells [3, 4, [11] [12] [13] .

To test whether pseudotyped VSV\u2206G-AFF-1 [6, 33, 38] can infect C. elegans, we prepared a recombinant VSV strain encoding the fluorescent reporter GFP, coated by AFF-1 fusion protein (VSV\u2206G-AFF-1). Briefly, BHK cells expressing AFF-1 were infected with VSV\u2206G-G helper virus (Fig. 1A) . Newly generated virions were coated by plasma membranebound AFF-1, thereby producing VSV\u2206G-AFF-1 pseudotyped viruses. Then, we titered the viruses determining the number of viral Infective Units (IU)/ml in BHK-AFF-1 cells. Finally, VSV\u2206G-AFF-1 viruses were injected into worm's pseudocoelom; a body cavity filled with fluid that surrounds the internal organs. We expected that virus injected into the pseudocoelom will encounter different cells inside the worm ( Figure 1A ). Worms were injected with VSV\u2206G-AFF-1 that was pre-incubated with \u03b1VSV-G antibody (see materials and methods and Figure S4 ), VSV\u2206G-G (as a positive control) or DMEM medium (as negative control). We used drh-1 (-) (Dicer Related Helicase -1) mutant worms, as they are more susceptible to VSV infection and do not have any observable phenotypes [7, 34] . Taken that VSV-G works unilaterally, while AFF-1 and EFF-1 fusogens have to be present in both fusing membranes [6, 16, 18, 30] , we hypothesized that VSV\u2206G-G and VSV\u2206G-AFF-1 will produce different infection patterns.",

It is known that in adults pharyngeal cells, head neurons, glia and hypodermal cells express EFF-1 [14] , while pharyngeal cells, excretory duct cell and glia express AFF-1 [18, 21] and lastly, excretory cell, head neurons, hypodermal cells and pharyngeal cells express EFF-2, a recent duplication of EFF-1 with unknown function (BG, Oren-Suissa and BP unpublished data). Importantly, BWM cells that do not express any known fusogen in C. elegans were infected by VSV\u2206G-AFF-1 in only 9% of the worms compared to 67% of the worms infected with VSV\u2206G-G ( Figure 1G ). These findings suggest that similarly to cell culture studies [6] , infection of living C. elegans by VSV\u2206G-AFF-1 follows a bilateral action mechanism, and that VSV\u2206G-AFF-1 is capable of interacting with several members of the fusexin family on the target cell. Therefore, we hypothesized that EFF-1expressing hypodermal cells could not be infected by VSV\u2206G-AFF-1 in the absence of EFF-1, while cells expressing AFF-1 or EFF-2 would still be targeted. To test this hypothesis, we injected either VSV\u2206G-G or VSV\u2206G-AFF-1 into the pseudocoelom of wt, null eff-1(ok1021) mutants ((eff-1(-); [14] ), null aff-1(tm2214) mutants ((aff-1(-); [18] ) or putative null eff-2(hy51) (eff-2(-); see materials and methods) worms, and quantified the percentage of worms with GFP(+) cells. We detected VSV\u2206G-AFF-1 infected hypodermal cells in eff-1(+) (Figure 2A) but not in in eff-1(-) worms ( Figure 2B ), while GFP(+) excretory and glia cell were detected even in the absence of EFF-1 ( Figure 2B ). aff-1(-) worms had GFP(+) hypodermal cells as in wildtype ( Figure 2C ). Overall, the fraction of worms showing VSV\u2206G-AFF-1-infected hypodermal cells was similarly high in wildtype and in aff-1(-) (87% and 92% for wt and aff-1(-), respectively) but was absent in eff-1(-) mutants ( Figure 2D ). In addition, muscles were inefficiently infected in wildtype and aff-1(-) mutants, and not infected in eff-1(-) animals ( Figure   2D ). The fraction of worms with GFP(+) excretory cells was not significantly different in all backgrounds ( Figure 2D ). Finally, the fraction of worms with GFP(+) glia/neuron cells was significantly higher in eff-1(-), compared to wt and aff-1(-) animals (Figures S1D-S1F).",

To exclude the possibility that hypodermal cells of eff-1(-) worms have a reduced susceptibility to viral infection, we injected wt, aff-1(-) and eff-1(-) worms with VSV\u2206G-G. We found that wild-type worms injected with VSV\u2206G-G, presented a full body-length covered by infected hypodermal cells along with muscles and excretory cells ( Figures 2E-2F ), while eff-1(-) worms had only few GFP(+) hyp nuclei localized closer to the injection regionthe head, as well as muscles and excretory cells ( Figure 2G ). aff-1(-) worms had hypodermal infection similar to wt animals ( Figure 2H ). Yet, the fraction of worms injected with VSV\u2206G-G that showed GFP(+) muscle and hypodermal cells was not significantly different in wt, eff-1 (-) and aff-1(-) backgrounds ( Figure 2I ). Finally, we observed a small fraction of worms with GFP(+) glia/neurons in the head with no significant difference between all tested backgrounds (Figures S1A-S1C). Thus, hypodermal cells are not compromised for VSV\u2206G-G infection even in the absence of EFF-1. In addition, VSV\u2206G-G with its unilateral viral fusogen infects different cells including muscles, hypodermis, excretory cell, and glia/neurons in an EFF-1-and AFF-1-independent manner. This is in contrast to VSV\u2206G-AFF-1 that uses a bilateral mechanism and infects cells that normally express EFF-1 or AFF-1 in adult animals.",

In eff-1(hy21ts) animals grown at the permissive 15\u00b0C, most epidermal cells fuse to form multinucleated hypodermis and vulva [14] . However, when eff-1(hy21) animals are grown at the restrictive 25\u00b0C, epidermal cells fail to fuse, producing phenotypes similar to the null eff-1(ok1021) worms [16] . Therefore, eff-1(ts) worms can serve as a temperature inducible system for modification of EFF-1 dosage in vivo [14, 19, 25] . To obtain varying expression of EFF-1, we maintained eff-1(ts) animals at 15\u00b0C, 25\u00b0C or performed 25\u00b0C to 15\u00b0C downshifts at different developmental stages and then injected VSV\u2206G-AFF-1 into young adult worms ( Figure 3A ). Wildtype worms in all experimental conditions had GFP(+) hyp nuclei spanning the worm's body from head to tail ( Figures 3B-3E ), while eff-1(ts) animals maintained at the restrictive temperature and then shifted down from 25\u00b0C to 15\u00b0C, had a gradual increase in infected GFP(+) hyp cells ( Figures 3F-3I ). In wt worms maintained in all conditions, the number of GFP(+) hypodermal nuclei was about 69, consistent with the number of hyp7 nuclei found on one side of the animals body [39, 40] . In contrast, for eff-1(ts), the longer time the worms developed at the permissive temperature (15\u00b0C), the more GFP(+) hyp nuclei were scored ( Figure 3J ). Thus, hypodermal infection by VSV\u2206G-AFF-1 increases with conditional induction of eff-1. ",

Hence, we propose that ectopic EFF-1 expression in host cells, such as body wall muscles (BWMs), could retarget VSV\u2206G-AFF-1 into these cells. C. elegans has 95 mononucleated rhomboid BWMs, arranged as staggered pairs and bundled in four quadrants that run along the worm's body [41] [42] [43] . While most vertebrates and invertebrates have syncytial striated muscles composed of long multinucleated myofibers, in C. elegans and other nematodes the BWMs have not been Most adult animals, including myo-3p::mCherry (+) and (-), were wild-type-like (Table S1, Figures 4A-4B and Movie S1), while about 10% of animals were both myo-3p::mCherry(+) and had an uncoordinated and dumpy (Unc+Dpy) phenotype (Table S1, Figures 4C-4D and Movie S1). Most myo-3p::mCherry(+), Unc+Dpy animals arrested during larval development (Table S1) (Table S1 ). Thus, EFF-1 expression in BWMs accounts for the Unc+Dpy phenotypes, larval arrest and clustered BWM nuclei, which supports the hypothesis that ectopic EFF-1 induces BWMs multinucleation by cell-cell fusion causing behavioral and morphological phenotypes.

EVs can serve as biomarkers and are potent vehicles for gene and drug delivery [26, 45, 46] . However, work with EVs-based vectors has to tackle the issues of specific targeting, loading of desired cargo, presence of undesired/non-specific content and quantification of produced EVs. Our system consisting of enveloped pseudotyped virus coated with bilateral fusogens and host cells expressing bilateral fusogens, demonstrates cell-specific targeting. Moreover, VSV\u2206G-AFF-1 has the benefits of viral-based vectors, namely loading a specific and tailored cargo including fluorescent markers such as GFP-coding RNA sequence, simple vector quantification and cargo amplification within the host cell. Therefore, VSV\u2206G-AFF-1 may serve as a paradigm for EVs-mediated transport. It can be utilized to explore how EVs deliver their cargos and to study whether and how EVs are involved in different biological processes. For instance, VSV\u2206G-AFF-1 can be utilized to study how vesicular AFF-1/EFF-1 delivery mediates neuronal regeneration. We can test a model in which non-cell autonomous, AFF-1-coated extracellular vesicles mediates PVD regeneration in C. elegans [26] .",

Myoblast fusion is also essential for muscle tissue patterning, maintenance and damage repair [62, 63] . In contrast, C. elegans BWMs do not fuse and exist as mononucleated cells, contracting in synchrony that mediate gait [64] . We found that EFF-1-mediated BWMs fusion results in loss of coordination, although we did not determine whether the observed locomotory defects result from aberrant joining of separately-innervated muscles or from a loss of contractility. These results demonstrate that a locomotory circuit may be optimally adjusted for both separate (as in C. elegans) and syncytial (as in vertebrate) striated muscles. Indeed, failure of myoblast fusion in vertebrates may have equally severe phenotypes [47, 48] . Despite the importance of muscle fusion, the studies of muscle fusion proteins are just emerging [55] [56] [57] [58] . We suggest that VSV\u2206G-AFF-1 can be used in screens to identify additional muscle fusogens in invertebrates (e.g. Drosophila). Alternatively, viruses coated with the bilateral Myomaker, can be a tool to screen for muscle-expressed Myomakerinteracting proteins in vertebrates.",

We found that for both VSV\u2206G-AFF-1 and VSV\u2206G-G, wt-like worms had individual GFP(+) BWM cells, that were mostly mCherry (-) (Figures 7A-7F, arrows), while Unc+Dpy animals had continuous GFP(+) BWMs that overlapped with mCherry along their body length(Figures 7G-7L, dashed lines and arrows). Compared to wt-like animals, the Unc+Dpy worms had about five-times fewer non-infected mCherry(+) only BWMs, a similar number of infected-GFP(+) only cells and about fifteen-fold more infected BWM cells that also express mCherry(Figures 7M-7N).

VSV and VSV-pseudotypes successfully infect invertebrate and vertebrate cell-lines and model organisms[1,2,[35][36][37]. Although EFF-1 and AFF-1 are not present, and have no known homologs in vertebrates, VSV\u2206G-AFF-1 infects mammalian BHK cells expressing AFF-1/EFF-1[6].

The PVD neuron is known to express EFF-1[25] and expression of a GFP reporter in the PVD dendritic tree shows continuous staining between individual muscle cells and the adjacently localized PVD branches[25,59]. Moreover, this muscle staining is abolished in eff-1(-) worms, suggesting that some muscle cells may transiently express EFF-1 and fuse to EFF-1-expressing PVD (Dganit Melamed, Meital Oren-Suissa and BP, unpublished data).Therefore, VSV\u2206G-AFF-1 may interact with undetected levels of EFF-1-expressed on muscle cells to infect them. On the other hand, this rare infection may be non-specific and could result from direct injections into muscle cells. For both VSV\u2206G-G and VSV\u2206G-AFF-1 injections, the fraction of worms with GFP(+) excretory cell is similar in all backgrounds. The excretory cell is suggested to eliminate waste from worm's body fluids[60,61]. Hence, it may endocytose viruses injected into the pseudocoelom and becomes infected independently of viral-coating (e.g. VSV\u2206G-G or VSV\u2206G-AFF-1) or worm background. Finally, we show that both VSV\u2206G-G and VSV\u2206G-AFF-1 can infect neuronal and glial cells. VSV\u2206G-G was previously reported to efficiently infect neuron and glia cells in mouse, rat, hamster, human, and Drosophila cells[2]. Some C. elegans neurons and glia cells are known to express EFF-1 and AFF-1[14,18], suggesting that infection by VSV\u2206G-AFF-1 could be mediated by bilateral interactions between the virus and EFF-1/AFF-1-expressed on the target cells. For VSV\u2206G-AFF-1 but not for VSV\u2206G-G, we observe significantly more infected glia and neurons in the absence of EFF-1. In wt worms, VSV\u2206G-AFF-1 mostly infects EFF-1-expressing hypodermal cells found in immediate proximity to the pseudocoelom. Moreover, the absence of EFF-1 abolishes hypodermal infection, which may reduce the competition for VSV\u2206G-AFF-1 mediated infection, and consequently increase the amount of infection in AFF-1-expressing glia/neuron cells. Alternatively, the infection of hypodermal cells could mask other infected cells and complicate their observation.",
