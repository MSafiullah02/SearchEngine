Because of these advantages, liquid ventilation with PFCs was initially shown to improve acute lung injury in animal models and a few human studies. Important mechanisms that attenuate lung inflammation include the distention of collapsed alveoli to improve lung compliance, improvement of oxygenation by increasing oxygen diffusion, and removal of inflammatory mediators from the alveolar regions of the lung [2\u20134]. However, two subsequent large clinical trials of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) showed that liquid ventilation was not beneficial for improving survival [5, 6].",

In addition, systemic FC-77 administration has been shown to attenuate acute lung injury induced by acid aspiration and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) [15, 16]. Although PFCs reportedly limit the infarction size in IR heart injury [17, 18], the beneficial effects of FC-77 on IR-induced acute lung injury remain unclear. Therefore, the present study was designed to determine whether systemic FC-77 administration ameliorates acute lung injury induced by IR. In this experiment, we used a well-established model of isolated rat lung because it enabled us to measure the pulmonary filtration coefficient (K\nf), which is the most accurate indicator of pulmonary capillary permeability [19].",

The animals used for this study were cared for in accordance with the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health (National Academy Press, 1996), and approval for our study protocol was obtained from the National Science Council and Animal Review Committee of the National Defense Medical Center. Male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (weight 250\u2013350 g) were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injections of pentobarbital sodium (20\u201325 mg/rat). Tracheostomy was performed to enable ventilation with a rodent ventilator (7025; Ugo Basile, Comerio, VA, Italy). The rat lungs were ventilated with 5 % CO2 in air at 65\u201370 breaths/minute with a tidal volume of 2 mL. After a median sternotomy was performed, heparin (1 U/g of body weight) was injected into the right ventricle, from which 10 mL of blood was collected. This blood sample was mixed with 10 mL of normal saline containing 1.5 % human serum albumin. This was subsequently used as a perfusing fluid for the isolated lungs. For constant-flow perfusion of the isolated lungs, a cannula was inserted into the pulmonary artery via a right-ventricular puncture. A tight ligature was placed around the main trunk of the pulmonary artery. A wide-bore cannula was inserted into the left atrium via the left ventricle to divert pulmonary venous outflow into a reservoir. The wide-bore cannula was then fixed with a ligature at the apex of the heart. Another ligature was placed above the atrioventricular junction to prevent the flow of the perfusate into the ventricles. Both the pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and the pulmonary venous pressure (PVP) were recorded from side arms of the inflow and outflow cannula. A roller pump was used to provide constant perfusion flow at a rate of approximately 8\u201310 mL/min to stabilize PAP at 15\u201320 cmH2O. PVP was set at 4\u20136 cmH2O by adjusting the height of the venous reservoir. With the isolated perfused lungs remaining in situ, the whole rat was placed on an electronic balance. The digital signals of the electronic balance were converted to analog signals with a digital-to-analog converter and were recorded on an oscillograph recorder. Isolated lung preparations were used in this study only if they satisfied three criteria: (1) no leakage at the sites of cannula insertion, (2) no evidence of bleeding or edema, and (3) an isogravimetric state.",

In addition, the promoter regions of many cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 are controlled by NF-\u03baB. NF-\u03baB activation amplifies an early inflammatory response and exacerbates tissue injury [35]. Previous studies demonstrated that inhibition of NF-\u03baB activity decreased lung reperfusion injury in porcine and rabbit models [36, 37]. The inhibition was associated with the suppression of cytokine production and neutrophil infiltration [37]. PFCs have also been shown to inhibit NF-\u03baB activation in LPS-stimulated macrophages, Chlamydophila pneumoniae-mediated pneumocytes, and models of respiratory syncytial virus-induced lung inflammation [15, 34, 38]. Therefore, our results are compatible with those studies.",

Further investigations revealed that PFC particles were ingested early into phagocytic cells in a time-dependent manner, thus resulted in the formation of PFC-filled vacuoles [39]. These cellular inclusions may interfere with intracellular signaling pathways and prevent the activation of inflammatory cascades. Similarly, Fernandez et al. demonstrated that PFCs interfered with transmembrane signal transduction by decreasing Syk phosphorylation in neutrophils. PFCs were also reportedly incorporated into the cellular membranes of alveolar epithelial cells and erythrocytes; this stabilized the cellular membrane and prevented surface receptor activation [34, 40\u201342]. However, other important inflammatory pathways may be involved in the protective mechanisms of PFCs, and further investigations are required to clarify these pathways.",
