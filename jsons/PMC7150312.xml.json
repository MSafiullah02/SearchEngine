However, the growth in this sector is under the continuous increasing threats of infectious diseases worldwide. This menace is further aggravated by globalization in animal trade for various purposes. The sudden entry of an infectious disease in a new country or geographical location could lead to delayed diagnosis and rapid spread into the susceptible animal population. In response to climate change, vector-borne diseases are also increasing worldwide. To prevent the spread of infectious diseases, one of the basic and critical requirements as prescribed by the World Organization of Animal Health (OIE) is the application of rapid, accurate, and highly sensitive identification of infectious agents. Though the term \u201cbiotechnology\u201d was coined in the year 1919 by Karl Ereky, the tangible biotechnological advancements in improving the human and animal health were started in the late 20th century. Since then, biotechnological applications have been making significant contributions in the development of novel powerful diagnostic assays for the efficient diagnosis and control of animal infectious diseases. Importantly, biotechnology has made the availability of pen-side tests for use at the field level to detect the causative infectious agent during a disease outbreak. In this chapter, we primarily describe and discuss the innovative biotechnological advancements made in the animal disease diagnosis in a step-wise manner.",

Vital sectors are under continuous economic loss and unrelenting development. The infectious diseases have taken a huge physical toll on animals and humans. This has pressed on humanity and has caused substantial economic, social, and mental losses. Thus, it is a matter of animal health and economic interest to invest in strategies to give a blow to infectious diseases and put them under control. Elimination of the pathogens and/or their vectors from their natural reservoirs would always be a first thought, but the removal is not easy, as they are constantly emerging and it is always very difficult to predict the emergence of infectious agents. Evolution of pathogens is putting extra challenges, pressing on humanity to look at the new strategies and forcing the researchers to look for innovative ones. The newly evolved pathogens are always more advanced and deadly from the previous ones and put up a strong resistance. \u201cFrom the evolutionary perspective, they [viruses and bacteria] are \u2018the fittest\u2019 and the chances are slim that human ingenuity will ever get the better of them.\u201d With the increase in the knowledge of infectious diseases and science, the degree of pace in pathogen discovery has increased. To keep pace and for better diagnosis, new tools and techniques need to keep on evolving. This is not only to quickly detect the pathogens, but also to make predictions with probable and possible outbreaks.",

This will facilitate in understanding the ancestry of the pathogen, and provide an insight and a mechanism for the epidemic, endemic, and even pandemic outbreaks. This system will also assist in understanding the interface transmission between and the directional flow of the zoonotic infectious diseases. Thus, phylogenetic analysis and epidemiology would aim toward strategizing the challenges during pathogen surveillance and discovery. SARS, a coronavirus was pandemic in 2003. But epidemiology and microbiology mediated to stem its disastrous results and also the causative agent of SARS was identified. Bacteria, viruses, and parasites, present in feces, contaminate foodstuffs and cause disease in humans and animals, affecting the social set up and consumer demands. To increase the productivity and for the maintenance of good health of animals, antibiotics are frequently administered resulting in the growth and emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This further aggravates the condition, and makes the situation more appalling. Overseas imported pets were also found to transmit and carry over the diseases to humans (Smith et al., 2012). Even aquaculture is at risk of contaminants with the virus directly affecting the marine lives, as in the case of the new virus discovered in salmon (Finstad et al., 2012). Even honeybees and other pollinators are transmitting pathogens like fungi, bacteria, and viruses through the contaminated food items (Cox-Foster et al., 2007).",

Among these, ICT and ELISA especially sandwich ELISA and competitive ELISA are used frequently in the commercial diagnostic kits for animal diseases worldwide. ICT assays mostly utilized mammalian IgG in commercial diagnostic kits, however, avian IgY antibodies, with added advantages over the mammalian IgG, have been employed for the detection of norovirus, rotavirus, and astrovirus in the fecal samples with good sensitivity and specificity ranging between 90% and 95% (Khamrin et al., 2009).",

For example, recently a novel ELISA for the detection of group A rotavirus antigen in the fecal samples of multiple host species has been developed (Kumar et al., 2016). This assay utilizes the potential use of synthetic peptides and is based on the detection of conserved VP6 protein using anti-recombinant VP6 antibodies as capture antibodies and anti-multiple antigenic peptide (identified and constructed from highly immune-dominant epitopes within VP6 protein) antibodies as detector antibodies. Another assay, which is simple to perform without the requirement of laboratory facilities, is dot-ELISA. A highly sensitive and specific dot-blot assays for rapid detection of staphylococcal enterotoxin-A in food has been reported (Singh et al., 2017). Dot-ELISA has been employed in diagnosing various important poultry diseases (Alam et al., 2012, Dhama et al., 2011, He et al., 2010, Majumder et al., 2018, Manoharan et al., 2004). Immuno-PCR is another powerful assay that has been used for the immunodetection of viral nucleic acids. By combining ELISA with PCR, sensitivity of detection can be increased up to 200 times and is especially useful in detecting low quantity viruses in the stool samples (Bonot et al., 2014). The major advantage of immune-PCR is that several viral nucleic acids can be detected simultaneously.",

RT-RPA was developed to study the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) disease in Egypt (Abd El Wahed et al., 2013). High degree of fidelity, portability, cost efficiency, simplicity, sensitivity, and tolerance to inhibitors, put this method into the category of resounding techniques, and implementation is quite easy at quarantine stations (Moore and Jaykus, 2017); while the latter one requires initial denaturation of the template followed by temperature labile polymerase dependent isothermal amplification and was designed specially to detect RNA (Compton, 1991). A multiplex real-time nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (qNASBA) system for the simultaneous detection of rotavirus A, norovirus genogroup II/astrovirus has recently been developed (Mo et al., 2015a). RT-NASBA proved as more efficient than the conventional RT-PCR and TaqMan RT-PCR assays (Mo et al., 2015b).",

Multiple diagnostics with hybridizing ability put it at more ease to strategize the control management programs. But, this technique comes at high expenditures.

With the advent, new kits for point-of-care detections, bioelectric arrays, and liquid microarrays are in the development process.

Nanopore systems can sequence both DNA and RNA viral genome in real time. This technology is based on the principle that when a strand of DNA/RNA is allowed to pass through a nanopore, the current is changed as the based A, T, C; and C passes through the pore in different combinations. Using these systems, sequencing can be performed on the portable MinION device, the benchtop GridION and the high-throughput, high-sample number PromethION. Recently, nanopore sequencing has proved a revolutionary diagnostic tool in detecting the Ebola virus (Hoenen et al., 2016), influenza viruses (Keller et al., 2018, Wang et al., 2015) and porcine viral enteric disease complexes (Theuns et al., 2018).

The POCD is basically a simple, rapid, and portable diagnostic device that can be applied at the field level in effective monitoring the disease status. Most of the commercially available POCDs utilize either antigen/antibody or nucleic acid detection technologies. The former is usually available in the format of lateral flow assays or immunochromatographic strip tests. These assays are simple to use, rapid, inexpensive, disposable, and thus make them the ideal assay for POCD for animal pathogens. The commercially available immunochromatographic strip tests for economically important animal diseases are summarized in Table 13.1\n. These assays are equally sensitive as compared to ELISA (Ferris et al., 2010). Furthermore, combining these assays with smartphones has made the increased sensitivity and quick reporting of results possible (Yeo et al., 2016). Therefore, these assays offer a novel herd level surveillance tool, and provide immediate results to the farmers. However, these assays have less analytical sensitivity as compared to nucleic acid-based POCD.",

Since the last few decades, a number of infectious diseases have been found associated with farm animals, causing colossal loss to the livestock rearing community and few of them being zoonotic in nature, becoming a problem for the public health. Highly contagious livestock diseases such as FMD, hemorrhagic septicemia, peste-des-petits ruminants, and surra cause irreparable economic losses. Several other infectious diseases of dairy cows such as BVD, Johne\u2019s disease, tuberculosis, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, and liver fluke infestations are generally regarded as being widespread and endemic. The best known and arguably most important discovery of farm animal diseases in the last few decades is bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and others include digital dermatitis, neosporosis and bovine abortion, bovine neonatal pancytopenia, Arcanobacterium pluranimalium, and Schmallenberg virus. Among all, the world organization for animal health classifies FMD and BSE as diseases of major interest in cattle. These diseases are known to have a significant effect on dairy production either directly due to death or indirectly due to effects on fertility or milk production, and subsequently, culling. The disease conditions are usually identified based on history and clinical profile of the affected population, but for affirmative diagnosis of the pathogens responsible, the identification of the causal agent is done on the samples or clinical specimens for submission to diagnostic labs.",

Albeit their usefulness as most sensitive method of detection, they are not used routinely due to time-lapse in confirming illness (Bursle and Robson, 2016). These methods may take hours to several weeks to obtain a confirmatory result. Therefore, other approaches based on morphology/biochemical properties of pathogens took the lead and were favored for pathogen detection and identification. Several infectious viral disease agents viz astrovirus, adenovirus, rotavirus, etc. were identified through electron microscopy (Ong and Chandran, 2005). But, these also have some drawbacks like more time consuming, less sensitivity, and costly instrumentation. Apart from these techniques, approaches like detection of pathogen-specific antibodies or detection of antigenic proteins of pathogens were adopted and categorized under serological assays. Serological assays measure antigen\u2013antibody interactions for diagnostic purposes. These assays are continuously being improved with technologies like rapid strip detection, thus becoming the most preferred tools and are broadly referred to as immunoassays.\n",

Although there is a variety of species which are suitable as companion animals (dogs, cats, rabbit, ferrets, caged birds, fishes, and guinea pigs), dogs and cats are the most common companion species. Their physical, behavioral, social, and emotional needs can be easily met at home. On the other hand, dogs and cats play a fundamental role in the life of human beings with many physiological and psychological benefits (Wood et al., 2005). Also, living with companion animals makes human surroundings happier and prosperous. As these animals enrich our lives, it becomes our responsibility to take care of the companion animals and to protect them from any kind of harm. There is a spectrum of infectious diseases that occur in companion animals. Lyme disease, psittacosis, hookworms, and Salmonella are amongst the most common diseases in pet animals. Some other examples include Rabies, E. coli, Rickettsia spp., infectious canine hepatitis, canine distemper virus, Ehrlichia spp., Helicobacer spp., Brucella canis, Bordetella bronchoseptica, and influenza A virus. Canine parvovirus (CPV) and feline leukemia virus are two of the important viral diseases of dogs and cats, respectively. Many of these infections are zoonotic in nature. The two most important human life-threatening infections include rabies and zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis, which are exerting their negative impact globally (Lembo et al., 2010, Palatnik-de-Sousa et al., 2009).\n",

Chances of introduction of new diseases also arise on the import of animals from foreign lands. Thus, maintenance of strict trade rules and regulations and hygienic conditions becomes a necessity. Once the disease occurs, it is important to identify the causative agent to improve the effectiveness of treatment and to control the disease. Since the clinical observations are not sufficient and can overlap with other diseases leading to misdiagnosis, several validated laboratory assays are used for confirmatory diagnosis. Until 20 years ago, these laboratory tests exploited cell culture (for isolation of specific pathogen) and serological assays (for detection of antibodies generated against a specific pathogen or antigenic proteins).",

Similarly, serological methods include a long list. Immunodiffusion testing is most often used to detect antibodies to fungal pathogens in dogs, such as Aspergillus fumigatus, Coccidioides immitis, and Blastomyces dermatitidis. Agglutination tests include the microscopic agglutination test for serologic diagnosis of leptospirosis (agglutination of live leptospires) and the cryptococcal antigen LA test (agglutination of antibody-coated latex beads). Hemagglutination inhibition is used to determine antibody titers to CPV and canine influenza virus, and it evaluates the ability of serum to inhibit erythrocyte agglutination by these viruses. ELISA is commonly used for the detection of feline retroviral, heartworm, Giardia, Leishmania, and tick-borne infections. Indirect IFA for serologic testing in dogs and cats include quantitative serology for some tick-borne infectious diseases (e.g., Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma spp.). Direct immunofluorescence assay in veterinary medicine include diagnosis of Giardia oocysts, FeLV within monocytes in peripheral blood or bone marrow, or canine distemper virus within epithelial cells from a conjunctival scraping. Many of these assays involve the use of polyclonal antibodies, or, more commonly, monoclonal antibodies-dependent diagnosis.",

Canine respiratory coronavirus, canine adenovirus-2, canine herpesvirus, feline herpesvirus-1, canine distemper virus, West Nile virus, and Encephalitis viruses are some of the examples, which are routinely diagnosed using these techniques. Other biotechnological tools cover hybridization assays, PNA, nanoparticles-based assays, etc. Hybridization-based methods have also been found to be compatible with the diagnosis of many diseases and composed of Taqman-based probes, molecular beacons, and FRET-based probes. Although not yet widely used for veterinary applications, PNA probes are now increasingly available to detect target DNA. Fluorescent PNA probes, followed by signal amplification were used to differentiate between M. tuberculosis complex and nontuberculous Mycobacterium spp. (Zerbi et al., 2001). In another example, NGS has also been used for the comparison of the oral microbiome of canines with their owners as they are in direct contact with their pets and many diseases might get transmitted to them (Oh et al., 2015). Gold nanoparticle-based immunochromatographic strip test using a combination of mAb and pAb was developed as an alternative for on-site and cost-effective diagnosis of CPV infection (Sharma et al., 2018). Another use of biotechnology has been observed for rapid and early detection of CPV using a QCM biosensor (Kim et al., 2015). Also, for genotyping of CPV-2, conventional methods are time consuming, therefore, a probe-based duplex fluorescence melting curve analysis (FMCA) for genotyping six different CPV-2 variants (original CPV-2, CPV-2a, CPV-2b, CPV-2c, and vaccine strains of CPVpf and CPVint) using only two Taqman probes has been developed (Liu et al., 2019).",

Further, NGS platforms like MinION (a portable, real-time NGS sequencer) coupled with NanoPipe analysis are promising tools to perform bacterial and viral disease investigation in low throughput laboratories and specifically in the field (Beato et al., 2018, Shabardina et al., 2019). Although, yet not been adopted for animal disease diagnosis, but novel platforms such as smartphone-based diagnosis (which expands nucleic acid-based detection assays toward POCD) like RT-LAMP and fluorescent lateral flow immunoassay (already developed for Zika virus and Dengue virus) provide exciting opportunities for veterinary diagnostics in the near future (Rong et al., 2019).",

Infectious diseases entail remarkable economic loss, weak food production system, food insecurity, and high maintenance cost of the agriculture sectors including farm animals, poultry, and aquaculture. Besides, these diseases carry a huge risk of transmission to humans as sporadic and endemic zoonoses. Classical and conventional diagnostic methods are labor intensive, time consuming, less sensitive, and difficult to meet the needs of the emerging pathogen diagnostics. Thus, new innovations have to be worked on and need to be practiced. Over the long term, innovations will be helping in the diagnosis of pathogens with accurate, sensitive and specific detections. NGS, biosensors, and advanced amplification techniques will persist for longer periods in their constant modified forms. Innovations will always be bringing the new applications in the diagnostics for the improved versions of techniques. New technique applications come with the cost and unbroken funding will be putting new prospective techniques into the trials. These techniques should be simplified in the innovations for their easy practices at the field itself, without looking for any skilled personnel/highly equipped laboratories.",
