            "text": "Very few experts can deny the vital role the WHO has played in the elimination or eradication and containment of infectious diseases and the awareness it has created globally about the risks of chronic or non-communicable diseases, especially during the last decade. The concept and origins of the WHO are quite interesting. The UN, of which WHO is one of its most important agencies, came into official existence on October 24, 1945, in San Francisco, when 50 of its members signed the Atlantic Charter. The creation of such an organization had been already agreed upon by President Franklyn D. Roosevelt (one of the most important spokesmen of the new international body), Joseph Stalin, and Winston Churchill. The most critical mission of the UN was to perverse world peace and security in the Post-World War II era by avoiding at all cost the mistakes that led to the previous world conflicts. For those who have followed the course of history, the UN was remotely related to the Quadruple Alliance (Austria, Prussia, England, and Russia) announced at the Congress of Vienna following the Napoleonic wars and French emperor Napoleon\u2019s final defeat at Waterloo in 1815. The aim of the Alliance was to maintain the status quo disturbed by the two Napoleons\u2019 ventures and ensuring that, if one of the four powers were to be threatened, the threat applied to the other three, forcing all members to fight together against the enemy. More recently, the principles embraced by the UN also incorporated those espoused by the League of Nations contained within the 1918 Treaty of Versailles, following the defeat of Germany in World War I, even though the US refused to sign it because of internal politics: Woodrow Wilson, the major proponent of the Leagues of Nations, which was to endorse \u201copen covenants of peace openly arrived at,\u201d failed to have the endorsement of his own country, but the remaining members of the League, led by Georges Clemenceau of France and Lloyd George of England, signed the treaty and tried to enforce it immediately. Wilson was an idealist who envisioned a world without wars, in which only diplomacy would be the solution for international conflict.",

            "text": "However, because of its weak nature, the disdain Adolph Hitler showed for its existence, and the appeasement policy particularly followed by Neville Chamberlain, Prime Minister of England, during the 1930s, the League of Nations had been rendered virtually dysfunctional by 1939. The UN was deemed to be the successor, incorporating relatively much stronger clauses and structures that would preserve world peace. To a great extent, this has happened. It stands to reason that, if an organization is strong and respected by the international community, the same can be expected of its components and its various agencies. Most experts would agree that this was the intent whose results could be seen through the creation of the WHO, which, according to many \u201cis the world\u2019s leading health organization, because, over the years, it has had \u2018a far-reaching impact on the status of international public health\u201d\u2019 (Ling 2002: 1). WHO components include the World Health Assembly (WHA), the Executive Board, and the Secretariat. Meeting with the 193 member states\u2019 ministers of health or their delegates once a year to discuss a policy agenda, the WHA is the decision-making or legislative body on the state of global health and recommends action that addresses problems that affect people all over the globe. This body also approves the WHO budget, with each member state having an equal vote on the \u201cdirection\u201d of the organization. Headquartered in Geneva, the WHO Secretariat is headed by a Director-General who is nominated by the Board and then elected by the WHA.",

The number of the member country\u2019s offices has varied. But in 2001, 141 WHO country offices were operating, the total number of WHO staff reaching 3,800 that year.

With time, however, the need arose to do precisely that: monitoring and surveillance of disease, announcing strategies and guidelines on health, and providing financial resources for the development of vaccines and the holding of immunization campaigns especially directed towards the health of women and children. However, the spread of infectious diseases and the continued outbreaks of disease epidemics, especially in the developing world, were seen as serious threats to human survival. These conditions were aggravated by changes in travel and communication that enhanced the spread of epidemics across the globe, which convinced the world community that a special agency was needed to fill the serious vacuum in the area of health. The WHO would also guide its mission according to the principles embraced by the UN, namely, promoting human rights, working towards social and economic development, protecting the environment at all cost, and assisting member states globally when disasters hit, such as famine, hunger, flooding, earthquake, an epidemic, and a refugee situation following armed conflict.",

It was thus that the WHO came into existence along with several other agencies within the UN framework, including the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) (1945), the International Civil Aviation (ICAO) (1947), the International Labor Organization (ILO) (1946), the International Maritime Organization (IMO) (1948), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) (1945), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) (1947), the United Nations Education Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) (1946), the Universal Postal Union (UPU) (1947), the World Bank Group (WBG) (1945), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) (1974), the Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) (1957), the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) (1967), the World Food Program (WFP) (1963), the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) (1974), the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) (1974), and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) (1977). As one commentator noted, at its founding, WHO was not intended to provide health services but rather be a coordinating body for global health policy implemented by national and international health agencies (Johnson 2011: 1). In fact, its original mission was ambiguous as it was designed for \u201cthe attainment by all people of the highest possible level of health, listing thereafter some 22 \u201cwide-range functions, of which the first was to \u2018act as the directing and coordinating authority on international health work\u2019\u201d (Clift 2013: 6).",

International politics also caused China to block Taiwan\u2019s membership of the WHO. Unfortunately, the WHO could not do anything in the face of the avian flu because it can only share the protocols but cannot force any member state to comply with its requests, even though it knew that China was not at the time in a position of develop a vaccine against the flu. This is the reason why many experts wished \u201cinternational health regulations would give the WHO more leverage during the transnational emergencies\u201d (Johnson 2011). Several developing countries would most likely side with China\u2019s attitude because quite often Western pharmaceuticals focus on drugs or vaccines that will benefit primarily the West\u2014ones that result in financial profit\u2014just as is the case with the attempts at finding a vaccine for HIV/AIDS in Africa, where the West has been testing the HIV sub-type B when the predominant strain in East Africa is HIV sub-type C. The reason is that, if they discover the vaccine for the African strain, this would not be as lucrative because it would not serve the interests of the West, which would therefore not buy it.",

On the budget, it is clear that the WHO is being overtaken by many philanthropic organizations that do not depend on member state donors, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, USAID, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and even PEPFAR provided by the US. These shortcomings are aggravated by the inefficiency and timidity in the use of the funds allocated for health across the globe. Indeed, instead of increasing, the WHO\u2019s budget has been shrinking dramatically since 2008. From 1990 to 2012, the overall level of global aid seems to have increased four-fold, reaching $22 billion annually, while that of the agency remained $1 billion, and continued to decline or remained static thereafter (Bollyky 2012).

The agency should also focus on its ability to engage in scaling up emergency measures that might have save the lives of thousands of people. Ebola, one the most deadly virus the world has ever seen, can be contained, as was the case several times since its first outbreak in 1976. The Communications Director of MSF, Jason Cone, has noted that the inability of the agency to contain the outbreak during a period of six months indicates the existence of a \u201chuge vacuum in leadership\u201d that it cannot fill, compelling, as well, President of MSF Joanne Liu to confess at the time that the world was losing the battle to contain the outbreak and, therefore, could not coordinate the international response (Gaist 2014: 1).

Prevention of vertical transmission of HIV to the fetus and the announcement of clear guidelines on the merits of baby breastfeeding constitute one of the most successful projects undertaken by the WHO. The fight against HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, called the \u201cBig Three\u201d in Africa, is being won, though slowly, but people are now able to live with HIV for decades because of new therapies, proving that having HIV is no longer a death sentence.",

Significantly, the WHO\u2019s turn towards mental disorders as serious illnesses is a move in the right direction, given that Africans have so far paid very little attention to the problem. Included in the arena tackled by the WHO are oral hygiene, veterinary science, occupational safety, special care for the elderly, and the fight against tobacco use, particularly among minors (see Oluwafemi 2014: 27). The various free publications and information one can obtain from the organization\u2019s headquarters, such as its Bulletin, and the many reports that can be freely downloaded from the Internet are a major source of health education and information. Rather than decrease its influence and its health service, as suggested by some, WHO has proven to be the most trustworthy agency of the UN, and should therefore be given enforcement power to ensure that our planet is protected not only from the spread of disease but also from corrupt individuals, including state leaders, who misuse the funds allocated for the improvement of the health of their people and endanger the safety and survival of the entire globe.",

After chronicling the history and development of the agency, the Center stresses that the major challenge for WHO has come from the World Bank\u2019s involvement in the health sector \u201con a large scale\u201d during the 1980s and the proliferation of a number of health initiatives thereafter, which placed in jeopardy the agency\u2019s authority in directing and coordinating health issues at hand, given that some of the new actors have a larger budget than this UN organization. The WHO also found itself challenged by the emerging new and old diseases, coupled with the alarming increase in non-communicable diseases and the impending threats of more epidemics, which underscored its weaknesses and its inability to act more effectively as the Ebola virus proved in Africa. These developments raised more questions about its future, especially in reference to its structures and operations. What is acknowledged, though, is that the WHO succeeded in placing center-stage the proposition that health was a human right and that social issues that cause or contribute to health inequalities should constitute a serious concern for all member states.",

Finally, though praising the constitutionally framed structure, critics point to the agency\u2019s actual function, which, according to them, \u201cis wrought with serious and complex problems of constitutional, political, managerial, and programmatic nature.\u201d The comment is applied in practice to the agency\u2019s interaction with the regional offices, the \u201ccenterpiece of \u201cOne WHO.\u201d This aspect has received mixed reviews from those who criticize the agency\u2019s management style and the nature of relations on the ground. Although some of the criticism may have some merit, it is often based on personal opinion couched in subjective information. Indeed, it would be a miracle, if an organization of such import and longevity as the WHO, which has to deal on a daily basis with issues of global relations and budget matters, particularly in time of want and recession, were not criticized for one reason or another. Criticizing is cheap but providing convincing solutions, based on the best practices available, is not an easy task.

He also makes the point that heterosexual transmission of HIV in Africa is often done through contaminated injections and surgical procedures, while the \u201ceffect of circumcision on the rate of heterosexual transmitted HIV could not actually be determined\u201d in the studies (see Azevedo et al. 2014: 248\u2013249). Important as well is the fact that the studies conducted did not take into account the age and time when those transmitting the infection were considered. Indeed, it does make a difference when the studies involve younger or older persons, and most of the participants have been young people. Recent studies, he claims, have not shown differences between those practicing circumcision and those not practicing it.",

The claim of the effectiveness of circumcision also creates a false idea in many men and women that an operation prevents HIV transmission and it therefore encourages unprotected and increased sexual activity, while condoms, less expensive and less invasive than surgery, have proven to be 99% effective. He mentions the fact that the various so-called \u201cscientific\u201d and \u201cobjective\u201d studies tend not to consider the role of culture and that surgery in African Western-medical facilities increases the chances of HIV infection through the use of contaminated or non-sterilized tools. Goldman also convincingly argues that circumcision causes immense pain in infants, to the point that some faint and many develop post-traumatic stress as they reach the age of six years. They may also experience reduced sexual pleasure, since the prepuce has been removed, which is there to \u201cprotect the gland and enhance feeling in the sex act.\u201d Finally, he notes that most of the proponents of massive male circumcision are themselves circumcised and are Jews or Americans. Goldman then writes, \u201cFor American society, circumcision is a solution in search of a problem, a social custom disguised as a medical issue,\u201d adding, \u201cBeware of culturally-based studies on circumcision posing as a science, and take your whole baby home\u201d (researcher\u2019s emphasis) (Goldman 1997).",

First of all, they say, the WHO/UNAIDS endorsement of the practice to prevent infection in 2007 has ethical and scientific flaws, namely, forcing people, including grown men, to be circumcised against their own will and their culture, whether they understood or note the benefits of the so-called medical male circumcision (MMC). African medical facilities are, moreover, incapable of reaching the goal of circumcising virtually all males not only due to their weak infrastructure and sustainability \u201cunder sufficiently safe, hygienic conditions\u201d (Garenne et al. 2014: 199) but also due to many other factors, such as lack of facilities and national funding. The problems the researchers had to confront from the start included confounders on how to determine the efficacy of the measures on newly circumcised persons and \u201cdelay to decreasing incidence; and global level of efficacy.\u201d When based on geographic and ecological studies, the conclusions were not unanimous but contradictory.",

Proponents have supported this measure of \u201cprophylaxis,\u2019 justifying it with scientific evidence\u2019 presented as absolute proof by the \u201cgold standard\u2019\u201d (Garenne et al. 2013: 204). The authors also note how quiet the media has been in the face of contrary evidence and the critical importance of taking a stand against \u201cgenital integrity and human rights.\u201d Interestingly, the studies have focused so far on Southern Africa. Finally, Garenne et al. got to the meat of this precipitously adopted MMC strategy by pointing out that:First, it will not have any major population impact, nor will it curb the course of HIV epidemics, as many studies cited in this chapter demonstrate. Second, it diverts human and financial resources into a single strategy that could be better used in other more effective strategies. Most African countries, for instance, lack physicians and nurses who are so badly needed to provide HAART treatments and other kinds of care; these countries also lack finances for their health care systems. In such a context, using scarce resources for a strategy that is unlikely to have a major population-level impact is questionable. Third, because circumcision has deep social, cultural, and emotional implications, MMC cannot be imposed on men; individuals must freely choose circumcision, so that population coverage will likely be below. Fourth, MMC on a large scale may have deleterious unintended consequences, ranging from infection to mild or moderate mutilations; these consequences are often disregarded in cost/benefits analyses. Fifth, MMC and HIV control strategy may encourage more dangerous practices. (Garenne et al. 2013: 197\u2013198)\n",

It is the most noble idea not only due to the hugeness of its chest funds but also to the goal and the unique way the Fund was to be organized and administered to countries of the developing world in particular. The exciting generous idea was accepted without reticence in 2001 by the UN and its Secretary\u2014General, Kofi Annan, who saw it as a winning proposition that would help Africa in particular where the three infectious diseases were most devastating. Subsequently, in 2002, he himself contributed $100,000 out of his own pocket to the fund.

Currently, more than 130 Theme Groups exist in more than 155 countries.

In 2014, the UNAIDS budget was smaller than the one the agency enjoyed in the 1996\u20131997 biennium, which was $120 million, of which 51% were used for country support, 29% for policy, strategy, and research, 11.5% for program administration, and 8.5% for program direction, external relations, and advocacy (UNAIDS 2014: 3).

The report adds that, in some parts of the African Region, 82% of them live with a TB condition. Annual deaths from AIDS-related causes decreased worldwide from a peak of 2.3 million in 2005 to an estimated 1.7 million in 2011, and the accelerated access to treatment has had its greatest impact in Sub-Saharan Africa, where an estimated 550,000 (or 31%) fewer people died from AIDS-related causes in 2011 than in 2005 when the number of deaths peaked (UNAIDS 2012: 24). Because of increased access to HIV treatment, the number of people dying annually from AIDS-related causes fell from its peak of 1.8 million in 2005 to 1.2 million in 2011, with most of the deaths occurring in Southern Africa. However, in North Africa (and the Middle East in general) the number of people dying of AIDS rose from 14,000 in 2001 to 25,000 in 2011 (UNAIDS 2012: 24).",

The successes are visible: In 2011, 1.4 million people were receiving more antiretroviral treatment in low- and middle-income countries than the previous year (UNAIDS 2012: 19). The UNAIDS Report further notes that \u201cThe most dramatic progress has been in Sub-Saharan Africa, where treatment coverage increased by 19% between 2010 and 2011.

The sad part of the equation is that 3 million people die for vaccine-preventable diseases worldwide each year, half of whom are children under-five (WHO, GAVI 2014: 1). This was the major reason why the Alliance decided to establish itself, as it also realized that it is cheaper financially as well (only $17 per child against the six child killer diseases, with a little more to cover Hepatitis B, yellow fever, and Haemophilus influenzae type B, recommended by the WHO in 2002) than to let children die or try to cure them. The savings can then be used wisely toward the eradication of other diseases and the reduction of poverty. Incidentally, it is estimated that the eradication of smallpox in 1977\u20131979, saved the world some $275 million a year. GAVI wished to reverse the growing trend of lower immunization coverage in many countries, which fell to 74% in 1999 from 80% in 1990 and galvanize international resolve to vaccinate children nationally and regionally.",

Unfortunately, the latter was Ghana\u2019s major source of revenue, followed by reductions in health and education spending; exports and imports rates were reduced, ballooning the 1980 $1.4 billion external debt to $7.0 billion in 1999. With the relaxation of environmental concerns at the hand of private Western companies, air and water pollution increased, malaria spread, along with other diseases such as TB and silicosis, and stories of corruption due to water privatization appeared in the papers. Ismi dramatizes the situation by noting that: \u201cThe World Bank\u2019s structural adjustment of Ghana is a textbook example of how to ruin a country. The ruthless denial of mineral wealth, food, medical care, education, and even water, has made the population destitute spectators of the plunder of Ghana by foreigners\u201d (Ismi 2004). Cote d\u2019Ivoire is another classic example of failure under the SAPs that serious studies have singled out. Its external debt rose by $3.7 billion in 1989\u20131991, increasing from 132% to 210.8% of GDP. Under the IMF and World Bank terms in 1989, Cote d\u2019Ivoire had to cut government spending by 30%, capital costs by 15%, increase taxes, privatize state enterprises, and, like in Ghana, \u201cderegulate the labor market, reduce the civil service, eliminate price controls, devalue the currency, and enact trade and financial reforms\u201d (Naiman and Watkins, 1999: 12\u201313). The consequences were devastating: poverty doubled between 1988 and 1995, from 17.8% to 36.8%; public health and education allocations were slashed by more than 35% for both by 1995; children\u2019s\u2019 stunted growth went from 20% in 1988 to 35% in 1995, much of it due to the introduction of user fees, according to some sources.",

The second phase of IFM reform package involved policies on liberalization of imports and exports, domestic tax reforms under the gun of the institution, to favor corporations, steady privatization and the abandonment of parastatals, weakening labor laws, reducing social spending, implementing user fees, and charging for condoms, all in the name of \u201ccost-recovery,\u201d which favored the rich and contributed to further impoverishment of the poor (see Rowden 2004).",

As consistently noted in this volume, the issue of Africa\u2019s leadership is crucial. As long as we have presidents and ministers of the various departments who seem to show little commitment to the plight of their citizens, and are unable to stand up when needed against the imposition of terms of development by the big financial corporations, pharmaceuticals, and expatriates who think they know better what Africa needs than the Africans themselves, nothing will change. The priorities in Africa are clear: ensuring that people have adequate and quality nutrition; provision of education for all citizens; making health accessible to all, as agreed at Alma-Ata in 1978; building and rebuilding the infrastructure; revolutionizing agriculture; and strengthening the industrial effort. Ismi, of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, echoes these ideas when he suggests six strategies for the future of Africa: participation of the poor, the vulnerable, farmers, rural populations, workers, women, and the underserved, and not just the elite, in critical decisions and policies adopted; some \u201credistribution\u201d of wealth (a concept and word rejected by the neo-liberals and those who believe only in market forces and trickle down theories); promotion of agriculture to increase production and feed and protect farmers from cheap imports and provide credit and subsidies to poor farmers who are unable to compete with the major corporations resulting from privatization policies; concerted work towards a strong industrial base, diversified manufacturing to generate more jobs for Africans; regional integration to accelerate reliance on local and regional products that will benefit directly or indirectly international and domestic output in industry and agriculture; and \u201cSouth-South\u201d cooperation rather than the current domination of the West and its multinational corporations over the continent of Africa.",

The study was jointly conducted by the Bank and an international group of non-governmental organizations called the Structural Adjustment Participatory Review Initiative Network. In it, the joint opinion of the participating institutions and organizations conclude that: \u201cpoverty has been further deepened by the inability of the poor to access essential services at affordable rates, which was disputed by the two international financial organizations\u201d (Third World Network 2002). The study also noted that the 42 poorest countries in Africa had lost 50% spending on health care during the 1990s, and that they were spending more on repaying the debt than on health or education. It is apparent as well that privatization of health care has moved health from the public to the private sphere through user fees, private insurance schemes, and privatization of medical consultations and treatment. Phillip Michael has argued that, though the IMF emphasis on \u201cearn more\u201d and \u201cspend less\u201d might make it seem that it helps repaying the loans, through the dependency that sets in, structural adjustment affects health care negatively through the closing of health facilities and preventing the hiring of more staff, or staffing them with \u201cinexperienced health providers\u201d (Michael 2004; Peet 2003).",

Its charter defines the organization as \u201can international, independent, medical humanitarian organization that delivers emergency aid to people affected by armed conflict, epidemics and natural disasters,\u201d regardless of race, religion, gender or political affiliation. Indeed, MSF focuses its efforts on alleviating suffering caused by war or any other type of violent conflict and natural calamities, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, rape and torture, abuse, neglect, poverty, and lack of respect for human and citizen\u2019s rights on the domestic, international, and global arena. Currently, MSF is organized into 19 sections, 24 associations, and other offices, which are spread over some 70 countries, most of which in the developing world, including Africa. Worldwide, it boasts some 35,000 volunteers, physicians, nurses, journalists, logisticians, lab technicians, scientists, administrators, epidemiologists, mental health experts, and water and sanitation professionals, a far cry from its beginning in 1971 when it had only 300 volunteers.",

The finances of MSF have apparently been quite open to researchers, and the allocation of resources is a transparent process. The organization gets 89% of its budget from some five million private donors, 9% from public institutions, such as the European Community and members, and 2% from other sources. Records also show that MSF spends very little on administration, management, and general activities, which take only about 6\u20137% of the total budget expenditures. Only 2% of the proceedings are dedicated to fundraising. Over the decades, MSF has spent more funds in Africa than in any other continent, over 60% of its budget. In 2014, the amount spent in Africa rose to 65% or 46 million Euros out of its 1.28 billion Euro budget, an increase of 272 million Euros over 2013 (Medecins Sans Frontieres Financial Report\n2014), when the overall budget was 1.2 billion Euros.",

The fortunate countries in Africa where MSF did its critical work in 2014\u20132015 on behalf of the sick, the poor, the refugees, and children in time of strife included Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Congo-DRC (since 1985), Egypt, Ethiopia (during the 1984\u20131985 famine, which led to its expulsion from the country for speaking out against the government), Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Cote d\u2019Ivoire (since 1990), Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya (since 2011), Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda (in 1994), Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, South Sudan (especially during the outbreak of the kala azar or visceral leishmaniasis in 2010), Sudan, Swaziland, Uganda (since 1980), and Zimbabwe. The war in Liberia, for example, which started in 1989 until 1996 to resume again in 1999 until 2003, appears to have affected some 49% of the women by 1998, who were subjected to at least one act of physical or sexual violence by soldiers or combatants. A study of Rwandan women showed that, for many, rape became their first sexual act, and 95% of these violated women contracted HIV/AIDS, which multiplied the rate of the epidemic in the country; this, of course, occurs on top of robbery, torture of women and children, domestic physical and psychological violence, street incidents, and armed conflict, which often resulted in deaths and injury, poor nutrition, and exposure to infections and deadly diseases, and less access to health care and disease prevention and treatment (see Niang 2008: 11, 35). It is amidst these inhuman occurrences that the MSF gets involved to save the innocent victims that have nowhere else to go to seek assistance, including medical treatment. Finally, it might be important to note that, even though MSF\u2019s work has continued to be vital and effective in the world, especially in Africa, the organization reluctantly accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in 1999, three years after it had been a recipient of the Seoul Peace Prize. A major factor that has contributed to MSF\u2019s success wherever it has worked has been its emphasis on gathering accurate and vital statistics, which have made it one of the most statistically grounded organizations in the world.",

It must be said that, no matter what its final verdict will be, AGI is thought to have contributed positively to the more effective running of the Ebola logistics operations, as happened at Freetown\u2019s Connaught Hospital. One other strong element of AGI was that the civil staff was drawn from the civil service and the city, and from what is called \u201cmanagement consultancy.\u201d As a result, Tony Blair became a major humanitarian celebrity among most West Africans.",

At its founding, in low- and middle-income countries, only 200,000 people were being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, and were paying as much as $10,000 per person per year for treatment. The number of people has, however, reached over 9.9 million worldwide now. CHAI seems to have tripled the number of patients being treated and has negotiated prices that convinced pharmaceuticals of the need to reduce them sometimes by as much as 80 to 90%. The Foundation has been operating in 38 partner countries, and 70 others have benefited from the negotiated price reductions on medical devices, diagnostics, and vaccines (The Clinton Health Access Initiative 2015). In Tanzania, where the first pilot project was introduced, CHAI, for example, has been able to reduce the price of artemisinin-based combination therapies against malaria, thus enabling the number of patients buying the therapies in private drug stores to increase from 1% to 44%, as is the case in Swaziland. In fact, as a result, Swaziland is the first country in Sub-Saharan Africa that might be \u201con the verge of achieving\u201d the goal of eradicating malaria. We end our discussion by noting that the Clinton Foundation has been a target of considerable negative publicity leveled by journalists, politicians, and some philanthropic organizations for allegedly not being transparent or forthcoming with its budget, and the fact that it seems to be receiving donations from several questionable foreign sources due to suspected inappropriate influence exerted by Hillary Clinton while secretary of state in the 2009\u20132013 period and as a candidate for the presidency in 2008 and 2016. In the 2016 presidential campaign, the Foundation came under heavy scrutiny and criticism, which may have contributed to Hillary\u2019s stunning defeat by Donald Trump. Apparently, Chelsea Clinton, daughter of the Clintons, has brought some transparency to the charitable contributions, one of the reasons why the Foundation is now called the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, even though many still call it the Clinton Foundation. Unfortunately, it is difficult to ascertain precisely how much the Foundation has spent on and in Africa, though the 2013 report gives a figure of $52,058,000, which is a significant contribution to the health needs of the continent (The Clinton Foundation 2013).",

The human conditions just mentioned are applicable to most of the countries of the Sahel, whose cyclical famines kill thousands of children and poor people when they strike, and in Sub-Saharan Africa, and have a direct impact on people\u2019s health. FAO was founded in October 1945 in Quebec City, Canada, and is headquartered in Rome, Italy, after it was moved from Washington, D.C., but has offices around the globe. Its decisions are made by the biennial FAO Conference, which has representatives from each member nation and the European Union. The Conference elects a 49-member Council, which acts as its executive body. Members serve for three years on a rotating basis. FAO is headed by a Director-General who presides over a Board of Directors consisting of 12 members.",

Unfortunately, the media responds slowly and the international community, even though fast to assist, tends not to figure into the equation the health needs of the affected population and does not look for and treat the structural causes. If there is attention given to recurring phenomena, it is usually short-lived. It is important, therefore, that we comment briefly on the issue of famine as it relates to disease. As a result of the food shortages in Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in the Sahel, during the 1970s, FAO took on the role of contributing to world food security and helping small farmers to grow better crops in 1974 at the World Food Conference. This phase was followed by a focus also on sustainable agriculture in rural areas and technologically meeting the level of technological advance of the host country during the 1980s and 1990s (Mingst, Encyclopedia Britannica\n2014).",

Three GHIs\u2014the World Bank\u2019s Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program, GFATM, and PEPFAR\u2014have contributed more than two-thirds of all direct external funding to scaling up HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care in resource-poor countries such as Tanzania (Biesma et al. 2009). Increasing access to health initiatives, doubling the employment of skilled health care providers, educating the community, addressing safety issues, improving water and sanitation, and discussing universal precautions at the workplace for nurses and physicians are ways of increasing involvement and efficacy of the health care system and optimizing public health outcomes. Indeed, HIV/AIDS is a lifelong illness and affects women, men, and children and all nationalities, no matter the socioeconomic status.",

For example, Zambia, Cameroon, Mali, ad Mauritania were accused of defrauding the organization at the tune of $25 million that simply disappeared and could not be accounted for, which caused Sweden and Germany to withhold their contributions to GFATM. The other problem has been the justified concern that the US wishes to impose its rule when it caps its contribution to 33% of the total contributions made by the donors. A further issue has been associated with the fact that some countries at times have been unable to disburse the funds as promised and have asked for extensions. These are not allowed any longer, as happened with Kenya and Uganda. In such cases, funds will be reclaimed. It is refreshing to known that, as a result of the unpleasant experiences over the years, GFATM announced its new strategies in November 2011, applicable to the period 2012\u20132016.

UNAIDS does not claim a victory of its own, given its meager annual budget provided by the WHO and philanthropic organizations, but it is entitled to share on the success. It has provided global leadership in the fight against HIV/AIDS, informed and urged member states to apply the best practices in the field of HIV/AIDS advances, has served as the most powerful advocate of those living with HIV/AIDS since 1996, and is the appropriate coordinating body for the eradication of the disease. Africa has been the greatest beneficiary of the creation of UNAIDS, as the figures on people being treated, saved from the disease, and the reduced rate of infections demonstrate. Some things are getting better in Africa in this respect but the battle is far from being won.

Beyond helping governments to provide nutritious food to their people, especially children, women, and vulnerable citizens through advice, special projects, and financial assistance, the agency has worked diligently with the relevant ministries of member states to adopt policies that promote good nutritional habits that will necessarily contribute to public health. FAO consists of seven departments that assist Africa: Administration and Finance, Agriculture and Consumer Protection, Economic and Social Development, Fisheries and Aquaculture, Forestry, Natural Resource Management and Environment, and Technical Cooperation. FAO\u2019s budget for the biennial fiscal year (2012\u20132013) was just over $1 billion. The funds come from voluntary contributions by member states and organizations. To the extent that FAO stresses proper nutrition, this UN agency contributes to health and public health in Africa, the reason why it is relevant and crucial. On its part, the Novo Nordisk World Diabetes Foundation, despite its small size in funds and personnel, is a most relevant foundation for Africa, given that diabetes, a chronic disease, is currently affecting millions of Africans. Not only does it contribute to the treatment many Africans would not have but it has raised awareness of the diabetes epidemic on the continent, which no other organization has done so far. In sum, no one in his or her right mind can dismiss the work that the unselfish and impeccably ethical MSF has done in Africa and other parts of the world whenever there has suffering from civil strife and war or natural disaster, such was the case the Ebola crisis in parts of West Africa where the organization deployed a staff of some 2,000 paid and unpaid, national and international volunteers. Virtually in every country that has experienced civil war such as in Angola, Mozambique, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, this humanitarian organization has been present. During the Ebola crisis, MSF lost some of its most dedicated physicians, nurses, and others that were involved in their mission to save lives, while overseeing the affected Africans and treating some 2,760 saving the lives of affected Africans and over half of them.",

Here it had its greatest impact through the thousands of effectively distributed hospital and mobile beds it provided and helped to recover, assisting the government, health officials, and health workers relocate and isolate the sick and placing them in safer hospitals and health centers. Beginning in 2009, the Tony Blair Africa Governance Initiative, on its part, has been assisting Africa in training health workers, with some 200 of whom becoming vital in the management of health centers also during the recent Ebola crisis. One of its most significant contributions in this recent crisis has been the collection, analysis, and provision of data, as well as making available critical health information through consistent and substantive briefings. These helped the government authorities and the rescue operators to identify the sources of the disease and the most effective approaches to manage resources and help the sick and those who were still at risk during the crisis.

Thus, the international organizations, such as the Clinton Initiative, both individually and collectively have been critical in the struggle to protect the health of the Africans and improve their health systems during the crises as well as under normal conditions. The humanitarian organizations in Africa have so far poured billions of dollars annually, in the hopes of raising simultaneously the consciousness of our, at times, seemingly insensitive, uninterested, incapable, and oblivious leaders in the face of the health catastrophes plaguing their own people, while spending the least of the vast resources in the struggle to stamp out even those epidemics easiest to contain or eradicate, as is the case with several children\u2019s diseases including measles and whooping cough.",

This may be done mainly through active and focused training of the locals. Above all, however, stands the absolute need for all humanitarian organizations to demand more accountability on the part of the African political leaders and those who manage the health ministries which have often become institutions simply looking for information and dispensing treatment rather than preventing disease.

Zambian Dambisa Moyo, who once worked for Goldman Sachs and as a consultant for the World Bank, writes in her Dead Aid: Why Aid is not Working and How There is a Better Way for Africa, that Africa has been trapped in and has become too dependent on the outside world\u2019s assistance, namely, the Western World, and that things will never improve unless the stream of assistance is stopped. She sarcastically writes: \u201cThe four horses of Africa\u2019s apocalypse\u2014corruption, disease, poverty and war\u2014can easily ride across international borders, putting Westerners at just as much risk as Africans. Of course, stolen money sent to European bank accounts can fund terrorist activities; disease, poverty and war induce waves of disfranchisement of refugees and unchecked immigration, which can place inordinate burdens on Western economies\u201d (Moyo 2009: 151).",

Were Africans to simply refuse all aid, refuse to pay back any portion of the loans and relinquish even grants, the whole health system would collapse, because the trillions of dollars poured into the continent annually would leave a deep crater with not enough dirt to fill it and restore the landscape. With assistance from abroad, both disease and poverty have, in fact, decreased in some corners of the continent. The problem is that they have not decreased as fast as on other continents. Smallpox, yaws, and polio have been eradicated from the continent. The prevalence of leprosy, river blindness and trypanosomiasis is at the tipping point where there is the probability that we can eradicate them during the next two decades. Maternal and infant mortality rates have relatively gone down. This would not have happened without the assistance received from the developing countries, no matter how one feels about the former colonizers. In fact, many Westerners unconsciously see assistance as veiled reparations for the resources they took from Africa to develop their own economies and reduce their own rate of poverty and disease.

The reasons are many. Africa has the least hospitable climate, the most difficult topography, and the least portion of arable land (6%) of all the major continents of the world. Corruption in Africa does not come just from foreign assistance: It is ingrained in the upbringing of many leaders. Thus, if the aid were to be removed tomorrow, corruption would not end. In addition, technology is still slowly trickling down to Africa. Who is responsible for the situation? Rather than advocating radical, unrealistic solutions, it is best to examine how foreign assistance is dispensed to Africans. First of all, the negotiators of the terms are the same people who siphon the funds for themselves, their families, and their cronies and are directly involved in the evaluation and assessment of the outcomes. Impartial and honest brokers, such as intellectuals and the people for which the assistance is targeted, are never present in the halls of the presidential or ministerial offices.

Consequently, what is needed is transparency at the negotiations and during implementation of any project and assessment of how funds are used; clear targets of the funds appropriated; funneling of most assistance to social programs (education and health) and infrastructure building; developing and transferring technologies, which Africans should insist during negotiations of the projects; provision of funds for projects where the recipients must prove their sustainability; insistence on democratic governance where civil society can actually be a witness to the honest use of funds; and, on the part of the givers, ensuring that Africans are not treated as ignorami, who do not know the needs of their continent.

Finally, Epidemiology 101 and Demography 101 warn all nations that, if the population goes unchecked, it will continue to choke any attempts at development, education, and adequate provision of health care.

Two African experts, Yaya & Ileka-Priouzeau, make the exactly opposite point, namely, that Africa needs international assistance to achieve its health goals and that an apportionment of about 7% of the GDP of the industrialized world would go a long way in helping the developing world achieve the MDGs. What is needed, the two authors say, are more effective partnerships with the developed world, which would be strengthened if the international community provided assistance to sub-regions and regions rather than to the individual little countries.

Indeed, as the adage goes, we need to think globally and act locally. Thus, regardless of how much this author disagrees with the overall policies of the IMF, he still agrees with the World Bank when it notes on the structural adjustments that:Successful implementation of these reforms implies a fundamental transformation of the role of the state in the African context of weak intense political opposition. Even if the necessary policy reforms can be carried out, adjustment programs will not solve all of Africa\u2019s problems. Adjustment can only create the necessary foundation for the resumption of growth. Reducing poverty and improving standards of living will require continuing investments in human capital and infrastructure and improvement in institutional capacity\u2026Strong leadership and good governance are needed above all, perhaps, to ensure that resources are used to achieve development goals.

Getting this right is one of Africa\u2019s big public health challenges\u201d (African Region Health Report\n2013: 125). Reliance on private donations, especially if faith-based, may soon disappear, and the fact that these often tend to discriminate against certain segments of the population becomes problematic in the long-run. Mbacke is blunt in his criticism of Africa\u2019s leadership when he notes that:The 21st century began hopefully with growing African leadership in the health policy arena and an unprecedented surge in donor assistance for health. But after one decade it is clear that the current situation is not conducive to building strong national health research systems in Africa. Consequently, the promise of strengthening the health care systems may remain elusive, despite the positive efforts. African countries are not acting to their declarations, and are reneging on their commitment to take the lead by increasing their investments in health and research for health. Although international support for health has increased substantially in recent years, there has been a continued focus on disease-specific initiatives. Much donor support funneled through international organizations, and country support continues to flow mainly to non-governmental organizations. The guidance of the Paris Declaration and the Accra Plan of Action are being royally ignored with more than two-thirds of donor assistance for health bypassing government. (Mbacke 2013: S15)\n",

In sum, developing national health policies across regions has yet to be done as a \u201ckey step towards taking a sector-wide approach\u201d that will contribute in its own way to the survival of our planet, Africa, and its people.",
