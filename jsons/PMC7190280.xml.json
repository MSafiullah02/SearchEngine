As he writes: \u2018It is a segmented, immobile, frozen space. Each individual is fixed in his place. And, if he moves, he does so at the risk of his life, contagion or punishment.\u2019 (Foucault 1975/1995: 195) Giorgio Agamben, basing his work partly on Foucault, by contrast, writes about the way Covid-19 has enabled the tendency to use a state of exception as a normal paradigm for government. He argues:Faced with the frenetic, irrational and entirely unfounded emergency measures adopted against an alleged epidemic of Faced with the frenetic coronavirus\u2026. why do the media and the authorities do their utmost to spread a state of panic, thus provoking an authentic state of exception with serious limitations on movement and a suspension of daily life in entire regions? (Agamben 2020a).",

The European Journal of Psychoanalysis provides a dialogue called \u2018Coronavirus and philosophers\u2019 that includes Foucault on \u2018Plague towns\u2019 and \u2018panopticism\u2019 as well as the brief reflection by Agamben with responses by J.L. Nancy, R. Esposito, S. Benvenuto, D. Dwivedi, S. Mohan, R. Ronchi, and M. de Carolis (Foucault et al. 2020). Agamben (2020b) elaborates his well-known argument about \u2018state of exception\u2019 to apply it to Covid-19. Nancy responds by emphasizing:We must be careful not to hit the wrong target: an entire civilization is in question, there is no doubt about it. There is a sort of viral exception \u2013 biological, computer-scientific, cultural \u2013 which is pandemic. Governments are nothing more than grim executioners, and taking it out on them seems more like a diversionary maneuver than a political reflection. (Nancy 2020)",

(2020) point out: \u2018In a matter of weeks (from February 21 to March 22), Italy went from the discovery of the first official Covid-19 case to a government decree that essentially prohibited all movements of people within the whole territory, and the closure of all non-essential business activities.\u2019 It is a different situation in the USA and in the UK where Trump and Johnson discounted the virus threat, instituted a huge bail-out for business, and talk freely and against their own medical advisors of getting back to work by Easter. Maybe, in Italy, Agamben\u2019s thesis applies. In other countries, the logic of government follows a different line based on propping up markets and the economy even at the risk and expense of large numbers of infections and deaths. The thesis must be able to take account of a nation\u2019s health infrastructure\u2014a fact that differentiates between social democratic models of public health and market-based forms like the USA where there is no universal provision. Trump wants to get everyone back to work as soon as possible and his government policies reflect this privileging of capital and the expense of labor. It seems likely that all the digital home-delivery companies and supermarkets that depend on cheap mostly Black and Latino labor that still able to operate in the USA will do so on the backs of low paid and temporary jobs.",

The emphasis of the two trillion dollar \u2018Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act\u2019 (CARES Act) (The Senate of the United States 2020) is to keep American workers paid and employed, to provide assistance to workers\u2019 families and businesses, and to support the health care system, with an accent on public education and innovation prioritizing zoonotic animal drugs. Title IV\u2014\u2018Economic stabilization and assistance to severely distressed sectors of the United States economy\u2019 looks at emergency relief and taxpayer protections as well as debt guarantee and hiring flexibility. Surely the form of governmentality represents another example of the ability to use reverse logic of neoliberalism to socialize any losses and privatize gains? The stimulus package of two trillion is the biggest in American history. John Cassidy (2020) remarks \u2018As a comparison, the Obama stimulus package that was passed in 2009 was about 4.5 per cent of G.D.P., or half as big.\u2019 It\u2019s too early to dismiss Agamben\u2019s theory for it may well prove to be correct especially as the time of the US elections draw closely: it is entirely possible that Trump will use \u2018state of emergency\u2019 to take exceptional government powers to declare a postponement for a year or two.",

When governments renowned for ruthless cuts in public spending can suddenly conjure up trillions. When toilet paper becomes a commodity as precious as diamonds.\u2019 He touches a chord when he writes with customary irony:An average consumer reason[s] in the following way: I know there is enough toilet paper and the rumor is false, but what if some people take this rumor seriously and, in a panic, start to buy excessive reserves of toilet paper, causing an actual shortage? So I better buy reserves myself. It is not even necessary to believe that some others take the rumor seriously \u2013 it is enough to presuppose that some others believe that there are people who take the rumor seriously \u2013 the effect is the same, namely the real lack of toilet paper in the stores. Is something similar not going on in the UK and California today? (\u017di\u017eek 2020).",

The WHO reports that in 2017, only 45% of the global population (3.4 billion people) used a safely managed sanitation service and 2.0 billion people still do not have basic sanitation facilities such as toilets or latrines with many defecating \u2018in the open, for example in street gutters, behind bushes, or into open bodies of water\u2019 (World Health Organization 2019). The WHO makes the conclusion that poor sanitation is linked to transmission of pandemic diseases and reduces human well-being. If ever there is an indicative index of development, it would have to be closely connected with sanitation and the ability to manage human waste hygienically. No doubt in poor countries like India, Middle Eastern, and African countries where there is little or no national health infrastructure, we are about to witness the devastation of entire communities that will linger on well after conditions elsewhere improve and the global economy restarts. This will be the greatest generational setback for these countries.",

People stood for a long time in queues that stretched around the isles jammed up against one another contravening social distancing design to preserve individual isolation. Panic buying of toilet rolls in NZ had increased 87% over last year (Shaw 2020). Hoarding and panic buying are examples of herd behavior where conditions for a self-fulfilling prophecy operate to cause the shortage that most fear. Consumer behavior theory mostly addresses \u2018single decision-makers faced with making economic choices in relative social isolation\u2019 rather than \u2018collective action such as fads and fashions, stock market movements, runs on nondurable goods, buying sprees, hoarding, and banking panics.\u2019 As Strahle and Bonfield (1989) go on to note \u2018[p]anic, as historically conceived, has been represented as a polar case of collective disorganization \u2026. clearly resting beyond the explanatory power of economic theories which depend on the rationality assumption.\u2019 I prefer to use the argument from \u2018cumulative collective irrationality\u2019 that contradicts the theory of efficient markets. Christoph J. Merdes in his dissertation on collective irrationality notes:collective (ir)rationality finds application in all areas of human social life, and a better understanding of the phenomena, the underlying processes and the evaluative standards could greatly improve our ability to organize everything from markets over democratic government to cooperative scientific inquiry and the social norms of everyday life.
