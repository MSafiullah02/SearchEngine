            "text": "Identification of protein function is the main theme of the post-genome era. Recently, biomedical scientists have been striving to study proteomics and explore the therapeutic potential of genes for curing disease. Thus, a powerful and integrated methodology is required for predicting novel protein function. During the past decade, many algorithms applied to computational biology have been used to solve several of the above problems, with the most frequently used methods including dynamic programming [1], the hidden Markov model [2], [3], the Bayesian theorem, and probabilistic modeling [4], [5], [6]. The Journal of Molecular Biology contains an introduction to hidden Markov models for biological sequences written by Krogh [7]. As a statistical model, the hidden Markov model (HMM) is appropriate for many tasks in molecular biology. A profile-like HMM architecture can be used for searching against sequence databases for new family members and also can make multiple alignments of protein families. Moreover, the latest review by Tsakonas and Dounias [8] indicates that artificial intelligence computational methodologies have been widely applied in bioinformatics, for example genetic algorithms [9], genetic programming [10], neural networks [11], [12], fuzzy logic [13], [14], and some classification and clustering techniques used in data mining [15]. Design of automatic models for comparing protein sequences that are homologous to a known family or super-family has become increasingly important. One standard approach to solving this problem uses \u2018profiles\u2019 of position-specific scoring measure estimated using multiple sequence alignment (MSA) [16]. In fact, a potential member of a distantly related protein family cannot be identified with the other members in the same family using only the primary protein structures. Consequently, a new protein, such as the case of the SARS virus, with numerous unknown functions cannot be accurately predicted by modeling a learning model. This study applies a hybrid methodology based on genetic programming with a causal tree [4], [28], [31] model to predicting protein function. The causal tree [28], [31] with a cause\u2013effect form is proposed for locally comparing protein sequences across each pairwise alignment of MSA. The clues to this proposal are that comparisons of distantly related sequences may carry more sensitive and accurate messages regarding protein function if given a segmented alignment using the more comprehensive depiction of the protein family. Additionally, the probabilistic scoring measures, similar to profile-to-profile comparisons [17], can be used to achieve one objective of genetic programming, namely aligning the hierarchical homologies based on profile comparisons. The resulting output is capable of function-related representation for further linkages of protein function. Furthermore, the proposed model can generate a tree structure output with a special aligned format rather than a traditional local or global alignment format such as CLUSTALW [23]. Traditionally, a local alignment based on the Smith\u2013Waterman algorithm [7] has been used to compare sequences with gaps using various scoring systems. Using scoring systems, many methods are used to evaluate the similarity of two profile columns, for example the FFAS method [18], and prof_sim [19]. The FFAS method can calculate the correlation coefficients and thus score the \u2018dot-product\u2019 scores of the amino acid frequencies in the two columns. Meanwhile, the prof_sim method utilizes a single similarity score combined with the divergence score and the significance score of the probability distributions in two columns. Recently, the method COMPASS [17], [20] generated the occurrence probability of target residue in one profile column based on the other column of given the target residue frequencies to construct the local profile-to-profile alignment. However, the proposed model was designed to detect the potential functions of a novel protein with a hierarchical homology structure. The hybrid model, namely Alignment using Genetic programming with Causal Tree (AGCT), is a heuristic evolutionary method that contains three basic components: (i) genetic programming with inner-exchanged individual strategy, (ii) causal trees [4], [28], [31] with probabilistic reasoning, and (iii) construction of hierarchical homologies with local block-to-block alignment using the methods of moment invariant and robust points matching (RPM) [24]. Locally, a standard construction of an alignment requires at least a two-step design: the first step is a scoring evaluation for similarity between two given positions, while the second step is an alignment extension that considers the gap penalties and an extension algorithm. The AGCT model applies two modified steps to an alignment with a standard construction. The first step is to change the compared objects from positions to blocks that initialize extents based on a particular signal wave, while the second step is to iteratively adjust the boundaries using trimming local fragments rather than the extension algorithm. Actually, in BLAST [21] and its successors [22], the effective local extension is displayed for the cases of sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-profile comparison. Similarly, in AGCT, the approach to a local block-to-block comparison modified from profile-to-profile alignment described in [17] shifts the leftmost and rightmost boundaries in relation to the parent segments when high local alignment scores are achieved. Notably, a detailed and refined procedure of alignment such as the Smith\u2013Waterman algorithm [7] is also used in a part of the proposed model for confirming a meaningful fragment detected, because a fragment with a short length reduces the computation time and only some individuals in the population have to be compared making the combination of heuristic and exhaustive search models feasible.",

            "text": "A traditional MSA method for protein classification compares more than two sequences to provide the aligned sequences for the observation of conserved domains. However, in a distantly related protein family, the data provides neither meaningful knowledge of biochemical function nor a consistent outcome when using different MSA algorithms. Clearly, the MSA comparisons would be worst if it is applied with the distantly related protein family members. In this model, a small protein fragment transformed into a feature-node would be a compared target point with spatially localized features. Individual feature-nodes simplified by six moment invariants [32] are matched with each other for the signal registration of 2-D curves [25], [30]. The 2-D curve is depicted using a block-to-block method that can transform a fragmenting sequence of protein residues into a signal curve by iteratively accumulating a block of amino acid properties. The signal curves are plotted by accumulating hydrophobicity against protein sequence here. Because the problem has been transformed into the problem of comparing feature-nodes (points), the comparison of spatially localized features for protein function can be considered an optimization problem of point match for the 2-D shape. In fact, the optimization problem is a difficult problem. Especially, the mapping problem must also consider the rigid and non-rigid deformations. A hybrid technique, combining genetic programming and the causal tree, is ideal for solving such difficult problems. Genetic programming has emerged from the evolutionary based systems [26], [40], [41], [42], and the causal tree is derived from probabilistic reasoning in intelligent systems [4]. Since the genetic programming can avoid local minima of an energy function, the model is appropriate for recognizing a potential pattern which is never found via direct comparisons.",

            "text": "This model uses a popular technique for synthesizing a special signal indicating specific protein functions by accumulating the properties of a group of protein residues. Comparing these special signals with each other can provide a wider window for viewing the world of the protein. Essentially, the signals must be decomposed for comparison using a method that can prevent a suitable waveform from destroying the protein signals. In the implementation, a technique of wavelet reconstruction for signals [29] is used to depict a noiseless signal curve skeleton. Next, the reconstructed curve is differentiated with respect to the positions of each protein residue, and let its results equal zero. The technique thus can easily identify some positions with local minimum accumulating properties. Subsequently, to preventing the generation of less than 40 residues, the method would discard some of the neighbor positions around the minima. Next, all of the fragmented signals are used to provide an initial dataset for the input of evolutionary computation. Although the local minimum values can not determine the true boundaries of the signals at the beginning step, the local alignment afterwards for fragmented proteins using the Smith\u2013Waterman algorithm [7] would iteratively regularize the boundaries until the suboptimal boundaries are found. Next, the model must further extract signal features from the fragmented input signals after decomposing the original signals. Technically, the vector features can be associated with the signal features. However, the vector value representing a signal must be invariant when the physical linear-transforms deform the signal curve (shape), such as move, rescale, stretching, and rotation. Once the problem is transformed into the image and signal processing domains, the RPM method is easily applied to protein function identification. Conceptually, this proposed model includes two stages for feature matching. The first stage is designed to obtain the initial signal features for the signal registration [25], [30]. During the second stage, an inner-exchanged genetic programming is used to repeatedly refine the RPM parameters.",

(16) is obtained: (15)\u222b\u222b[(\u22022f\u22022x\u21922)2+2(\u22022f\u2202x\u2192\u2202y\u2192)2+(\u22022f\u22022y\u21922)2]dx\u2192dy\u2192=\u222b\u222bf2(x\u2192,y\u2192)dx\u2192dy\u2192=\u2211a=1K\u03bb\u02c6a2=trace(W~t\u03a6W~) where \u03bb\u02c61\u2265\u03bb\u02c62\u2265\u22ef\u03bb\u02c6K\u22650 denote eigenvalues of the continuous eigenfunction \u03d51,\u03d52,\u2026,\u03d5K, and W~t is the transposed matrix of W~. (16)ETPS\u20d7(A~,W~)=\u2016X\u2192\u2212\u03a8\u2192A~D+1,D+1\u2212\u03a6K,KW~K,D+1\u20162+\u03bbtrace(W~K,D+1t\u03a6K,KW~K,D+1) where X\u2192 and \u03a8\u2192 are merely concatenated versions of the vector values of the nodes x\u2192a\u2208X\u2192 and \u03c9\u2192a\u2208\u03a8\u2192. Additionally, \u03a6 is a (K\u00d7K) matrix generated from the \u03d5(\u03c9\u2192a) of the (1\u00d7K) vectors. Each row of the matrix derives from the original vectors. In the model, an energy function with the affine A~ and warping W~ parameters, which is derived from Eqs. (13), (14), (15), (16), is used as a fitness function with genetic programming. Furthermore, the local border between two regions of protein fragments should be considered an important feature for understanding protein functions. Therefore, a distinctive characteristic of the TPS can always decompose a geometrical transformation into a global affine transformation and a local non-affine warping component. Using this characteristic, a functional signal generally can be detected based on the same essential protein family even if it is undergoing various environment parameters. The parameters include the setting of primary forming signal of the sequences, for example the fragment length in relation to signal response. Alternatively, the rotation, translation, and global shear of the signals should slightly influence the detection of the functional signals based on the feature geometrical characteristics (pattern). Consequently, the smoothness term W~ in Eq. (16) is specifically applied to be the warping components, and this term should be penalized when signal deformation is ineffective to their essential properties. Visually, two compared objects with similar patterns should increase the influence of TPS to interpolate a fitting spline. Correspondingly, the similar protein fragments compared with one another can be identified by TPS matching.",

            "text": "The subsection formally defines a correspondence matrix for a causal tree via the strategy of a one-to-many query. Assume that a sequence {Q1} with unknown functions is used as a query sequence to compare with the fragmented member sequences {Qx}x=2Z for constructing an optimal hierarchical structure. The optimal structure should comprise the maximum of homology relationships among these protein fragments of both \u2018query\u2019 and \u2018member\u2019. Moreover, Z denotes the number of the input sequence classified to the same distantly related protein family. Furthermore, let M~ denote a correspondence matrix representing the correspondence between two node-sets in a tree. Assume the matrix contains (N+1)\u00d7(K+1) elements: (17)M~={[mia]N+1,K+1\u2223mia\u2208[0,1],\u2211i=S1+1Nmi(N+1)=1\u2227\u2200i\u2264S1\u03f6mi(N+1),\u2211a=S1+1N+1maa=0,\u2211a=S1+1,i\u2260aN+1mia=1,\u2200i=1,2,\u2026,N} where each mia is an element of the matrix, with a value that is a real number between zero and one. One query sequence Q1 is divided into S1 fragments. The summation of mia in Eq. (17) for the constraints of each row in M~ must equal one. The node of the same label thus appears in the tree a maximum of once. The WTA method and Sinkhorn balancing theorem [36] can be used to normalize mia to satisfy the row and column constraints in Refs. [24], [27], [36]. However, this model only uses the row constraint to modify WTA as RO-WTA. Alternatively, the correspondence matrix for a causal tree must satisfy the constraint \u2211a=S1+1,i\u2260aN+1mia=1 in Eq. (17) to implement a one-to-many relationship. Simultaneously, a constraint \u2211a=S1+1N+1maa=0 is used to prevent a self-correspondence. The self-correspondence that appears when one feature-node points to itself is invalid. Furthermore, a constraint \u2211i=S1+1Nmi(N+1)=1 and \u2200i\u2264S1\u03f6mi(N+1) can decide the node of the unique root. From the definition of the correspondence matrix in Eq. (17), let: (18)K=N\u2212S1 where K represents the number of parent nodes with the starting number one and ending at number K. However, the alternative representation is beginning at number S1+1 and ending at number N. In fact, the two numbering representations are identical for the convenience of representation and implementation.

Moreover, the variable Sp denotes the number of fragments in each protein sequence.",

Alternatively, the model can generate the minimum number of states required to push the objective minimum away from the discrete points such that some rules emerge from mia. A gradually reduced temperature T can suitably control thermal fluctuation to yield an optimal solution. Regarding related applications, the application of this entropy term to statistical physics is also briefly described in [37], [38], [39]. Subsequently, the fourth term in Eq.

The differences stimulate some unphysical reflections that result from flipping through the whole plane. The fifth term in Eq.

Using the basic probability theorem, then assuming that P(xi,xa) denotes the joint probability distribution of two random variables xi and xa, and that P(xi\u2223xa) denotes the conditional probability of xi given xa; this conditional probability is defined as follows: (29)P(xi\u2223xa)=P(xi,xa)P(xa).\n",

            "text": "Using the Bayes inference described in [4], Eqs. (30), (31) are easily derived by Eq. (29). (30)P(xi\u2223xa)=P(xa\u2223xi)P(xi)P(xa)(31)P(xi\u2223xa\u2032,xa)=P(xa\u2223xi) where xi and xa\u2032 are conditionally independent given xa. Subsequently, a well defined Bayes model can be obtained by further generalizing beyond simple Markov models and considering the probability distribution in the form of general trees. By the expansions of Eqs. (30), (31), a probability distribution can be applied to learning and inferring for biological models when the tree network has a specific predetermined structure. During a learning phase, the variables within internal nodes and external nodes represent a set of member states and query states, respectively. These variables are both observable during the learning phase. Instead, these variables are hidden during an inferring phase when the structure and probability distributions of a causal tree are temporally fixed. This process fully corresponds to the operation of hidden states in a hidden Markov model. Iteratively, the model eventually produces a refined prediction result based on fitness function estimation. Recalling the example of a causal tree, Fig. 1 defines nine random binary variables on the tree. The case produces a joint probability distribution of the nine variables using a product of the following terms: (32)P(x0,x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6,x7,x8,x9)=P(x7)P(x6\u2223x7)P(x9\u2223x7)P(x5\u2223x7)P(x1\u2223x6)P(x4\u2223x6)P(x3\u2223x9)P(x8\u2223x5)P(x2\u2223x8)=P(x7)P(x6\u2223x7)P(x1\u2223x6)P(x4\u2223x6)P(x9\u2223x7)P(x3\u2223x9)P(x5\u2223x7)P(x8\u2223x5)P(x2\u2223x8) where each internal node xi separates variables above and below it. For example, using Eq. (31) can show that the node x7 gains the conditional probability P(x6\u2223x7,x6,x1,x4)=P(x6\u2223x7). Initially, the root variable x7 in Eq. (32) first generates a value using the result from Eq. (28). Given x7, the probabilistic model can determine the conditional probabilities P(x6\u2223x7), P(x9\u2223x7), and P(x5\u2223x7). This model then can generate the values of x6, x9, and x5, respectively. This model thus can calculate the remaining variables recursively. Finally, this model obtains an estimated value as one of the multiple fitness functions described in the following section. By rearranging and observing the terms in Eq. (32), an ordered product of terms is also very easily implemented by a preorder tree search. Besides the fitness function of the probabilistic and RPM models mentioned above, the model needs another fitness function to determine the boundaries of protein fragments. Eq. (33) shows the normalized measures of a local alignment score \u03b1\u00af divided by the sequence length and obtained by the Smith\u2013Waterman algorithm [7].

            "text": "In 1992, Koza et al. were early pioneers of the concept of genetic programming [26], [40], [41], [42] which was extended from the genetic algorithm. Genetic programming can automatically create programs for solving general problems. Genetic programming is based on a grammar-based methodology of an evolutionary theorem using the Darwinian survival principle. Therefore, genetic programming can describe highly complicated models for any domain problem without sufficient domain knowledge. First, problem solving requires randomly yielding an initial population of individuals. Subsequently, a fitness function can be used to evaluate individuals in the population and select excellent individuals for further performing specific genetic operations. The genetic operations typically include crossover, replication, and mutation operations. The operations enable the parent population at a given generation to form a new offspring population at the next generation. Iteratively, genetic programming continuously performs the above evolutionary steps until obtaining an optimal individual or satisfying certain conditions. A representation of genetic programming for a domain problem is composed of several functional programs. The programs form a rooted tree structure as a solution for solving the problem. Because genetic programming uses a tree form, the model can easily provide a flexible hierarchical presentation to estimate the relationship of homologies for predicting protein function. Characteristically, genetic programming provides a mechanism for searching for the fittest individual. The individual is the problem solution provided by using the computer program in the search space of all possible computer programs. The search space comprises terminal-nodes (external nodes) and function-nodes (internal nodes) that are appropriate to represent the specific problem [26]. When a causal tree following genetic operations generates an infeasible individual, the model must regularize this infeasible individual by using a tournament pick (TP) method. The TP method using the depth-first search (DFS) strategy is proposed to accelerate the performance of regularizing this infeasible individual to a feasible one. The TP+DFS method recursively cures the infeasible nodes residing in this individual. The method replaces an infeasible node with a feasible node, in a preorder visiting for trees, randomly selected from the tournament that contains numerous feasible nodes. This advantage of the TP+DFS method results from the mutation appearing at a suitable time, and estimates the fitness function simultaneously following the crossover. When all individuals conform to all constraints of a causal tree, a fitness function can be used for individual estimation. To improve prediction speed and accuracy, this model uses a multiple fitness function strategy. This strategy implements an exchanged individual mechanism involving three subpopulations. The model next considers the following parameters for developing a co-evolution with the strategy of inner-exchanged individuals in a population. The model exchanges the individuals in the three subpopulations 0, 1, and 2. There are nN individuals in subpopulation 0, nM individuals in subpopulation 1, and nK individuals in subpopulation 2, respectively. The size of the subpopulations should have nN\u226bnM, nK for considering a trade-off between speed and accuracy. The selection method used in the model always uses the tournament selection strategy rather than the fitness-proportionate selection strategy. Additionally, the tournament selection (TS) differs from TP in the target level. The former selects the individuals in the population as its targets on the size 7 tournament. Meanwhile, the latter selects the programs (nodes) of an individual (tree) to do the same. Regarding the probabilities of genetic operations, the genetic operation of crossover and reproduction gives values of 0.9 and 0.1, respectively. To control tree shape, the tree depth must be 20 or less after performing the crossover operation. Furthermore, each internal node has between one and three children connected to it. Related applications employing genetic programming can be found in [43], [44], [45].",

Initially, a set of initial feature nodes is fed into the subpopulation 0. Subsequently, two feature-node sets produced by random orders of all feature-nodes match each other with TPS methods to find the best correspondence between them. The subpopulation 0 is responsible for comparing the functional signals via heuristic matching. For effective heuristic match, the model assumes that the identical conserved protein domains demonstrate genetically similar functions given analogous functional signal shapes. Consequently, a physical deformation of the signal shapes should be preserved in somewhat ancestral contours. Subsequently, in Fig. 4, the n best individuals of subpopulation 0 must emigrate into subpopulation 1 for modifying the correct boundaries of the protein fragments. In subpopulation 1, an exhausted local alignment of two fragments (nodes) is used to adjust the boundaries of two protein fragments. Meanwhile, a moment invariant method calculates a new set of feature data for updating the signal data. Moreover, the model must realign the protein fragments once the boundaries of the related fragments have been changed. Next, the m best individuals of subpopulation 1 must emigrate into subpopulation 2 to confirm the significant protein fragments by training of real cases. Moreover, the n best individuals of subpopulation 0 also must emigrate into subpopulation 2 to do the same work. Finally, the k best individuals of subpopulation 2 must emigrate into subpopulation 0 to resume the individuals having specific biological evidence. These resumed individuals can improve the quality of the individuals of subpopulation 0 using the guidelines from real cases. Simultaneously, subpopulation 2 eliminates the worst individuals from subpopulation 2 to prevent them from backing to subpopulation 0 or 2. When all of the individuals in the three subpopulations have been coevolved by genetic programming, a final solution should select the optimum individual from subpopulation 0. Specifically, the solution takes the form of a causal tree. Each path from the root node to any external node represents the functional heredity process. This path can provide an auxiliary guide to biologists for comprehensively understanding the unknown function of query sequences. The strategies used by exchanged individuals are feasible and essential for improving the final solution quality. More specifically, the model cooperatively evolves the causal trees via the cooperation of multiple fitness functions. The multiple fitness functions use Eq. (27) as the fitness function of subpopulation 0, Eq. (33) as the fitness function of subpopulation 1, and the product of Eq. (30) for all nodes as the fitness function of subpopulation 2.

Although fewer individuals are involved in case III than case II, the resulting reports in case III are the best except for this sensitivity result. The following discussion can further explain the above confusion. Although cases II and IV involve the same numbers of individuals, case IV involves more immigrated or emigrated individuals than case II. Consequently, case IV obtains worse results than case II. The above demonstrates that, appropriate individual migration is essential for improving solution quality. However, the amount of migration should not be too large to perform the normal evolution by genetic programming. Meanwhile, population size is not particularly important in the present cases since the RPM method and Smith\u2013Waterman algorithm can undoubtedly obtain the local optimal result for each generation of genetic programming. Therefore, even through case III involves fewer individuals than case II, case III can still achieve the performance results approaching case II. Finally, the mechanism of premature convergence in cases I and IV attained the worst results. Clearly, case V improves the results of case V through a long-term evolution.",

This model differs in numerous respects from the other traditional model of MSA. Nevertheless, this model still includes various traditionally popular methods used for the high level application, predicting protein function. These methods include genetic programming, wavelet transform, profile comparison, local alignment with the Smith\u2013Waterman algorithm, moment invariant theorem, RPM with TPS, Bayes inference, and the causal tree model. Besides the above methods, this model introduces various strategies, including the inner-exchanged individuals in subpopulations, cooperation of multiple fitness functions, guided evolution involving real cases, and TP+DFS regularization. The prediction accuracy thus can be improved. This hybrid model is developed to exploit global search capabilities in genetic programming for predicting protein functions of a distantly related protein family that have difficulties in the conserved domain identification. Moreover, the RPM involved can identify more sequence homologies through softening comparisons. Essentially, this work contributed a complex and integrated methodology that enables new advances in predicting protein function in the post-genome era. We believe that the model robustness can be increased in the future if biologists generate more experimental data in laboratories. Future works will apply this model to investigate issues related to protein interaction.",
