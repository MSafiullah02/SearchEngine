However, owing to the acquisition of DNA through lateral gene transfer, the differences between closely related bacterial strains can be vast. By contrast, whole-genome sequencing comparisons allow a multitude of genes to be compared. Already, several bacterial species have had more than a single representative sequenced (e.g. Escherichia coli [1], Campylobacter jejuni [2], Helicobacter pylori [3], Yersinia pestis [4], Neisseria meningitides [5], Staphylococcus aureus [6] and several Chlamydia species [7]). Nevertheless, whole-scale genome sequencing remains an expensive endeavour and such comparisons are limited to only a handful of strains.",

Harnessing DNA microarray information through interrogative and robust algorithms has enabled a true \u2018comparative phlyogenomics\u2019 approach to be developed. Recent comparative phlyogenomics studies have been undertaken on increasingly large collections of strains of defined origin. One common feature of these studies is the unexpectedly large genetic diversity between strains of the same species, blurring our definition of species boundaries. Whole-genome comparisons typically identify sets of \u2018core genes\u2019, which are shared by all strains in a species, and \u2018accessory genes\u2019, which are present in one or more strains in a species and often result from gene acquisition. It is these differences that can often be used to identify genes and/or genetic islands related to \u2018gain-of-function traits\u2019 in pathogenic strains. Uncovering the mechanisms behind this variability is fundamental in understanding and ultimately counteracting the threats posed by our old adversaries.",

Currently, up to 50 000 gene fragments can be spotted onto a single microscope slide using robotic technology. Advantages of this technology are: flexibility in the design of the array; the relative ease of production; and its relatively low cost. Multiple identical microarrays can be robotically printed in batches of over a hundred in a single run. Most of the cost in printing such arrays is caused by the synthesis of oligonucleotide primer pairs required for the amplification of target gene fragments. The use of clone libraries as the template for the amplification of PCR products can dramatically reduce this cost [8].",

Such genetic differences are more evident in the highly clonal species such as Vibrio cholerae, in which microarray studies showed that all strains tested were <1% divergent from each other over their entire genome [9]. These differences provide clues to the evolution of V. cholerae as a human pathogen and as an environmental organism. Historically, the first six V. cholerae pandemics between 1817 and 1923 were caused by classical biotype strains from the O1 serogroup. However, the emergence of the seventh pandemic El Tor biotype in 1961 eventually resulted in the global elimination of classical biotype strains as a cause of disease. Microarray analysis revealed chromosomal islands specific to all pandemic strains as well as two chromosomal islands that are uniquely present in the modern-day pandemic El Tor strain. This suggested that these regions might encode factors specifically associated with displacement of the pre-existing classical strains in South Asia and might also promote the establishment of endemic disease in previously cholera-free locations [9].",

These are mainly grouped in large chromosomal regions of difference (RDs), and are often associated with phage genes, integrases or transposases. Of the 18 RDs identified, 10 contained putative virulence determinants (including enterotoxins and the methicillin-resistance gene mec) that appear to have been acquired independently into the chromosome background of several phylogenetically distinct strains. This demonstrated that methicillin-resistant strains have evolved multiple independent times, rather than from a single ancestral strain. It has also helped to resolve the long-standing controversy that the 1970s epidemic of toxic shock syndrome was caused by a change in the host environment (i.e. the use of certain tampons), rather than by the rapid geographic dissemination of a new hypervirulent S. aureus strain [10]. Interestingly, the epidemic methicillin-resistant S. aureus-15 (EMRSA-15) clone, one of the most prevalent MSRA strains in the UK, appears to have resulted from a large-scale recombination event [11]. Other microarray studies of this kind have recently identified specific RDs and coding sequences that might be responsible for hypervirulence of certain strains in animal models of muscoskeletal infections [12].",

Genetic characterization of these closely related organisms represents a useful model to study the rapid emergence of bacterial pathogens that threaten mankind. Studies using a Y. pestis-specific microarray identified 11 Y. pestis DNA loci that were absent or highly divergent in all 22 strains tested. Four were regions of phage origin, whereas the other seven included genes that encode a vitamin B12 receptor and the insect toxin SepC. These studies help predict the genome content of the single Y. pseudotuberculosis strain that evolved into the Y. pestis (sub)species [15]. Microarray-based studies to determine the evolution of Y. pestis have shown that recombination between the frequent insertion sequence elements scattered around the chromosome has resulted in large-scale deletions in most strains [15, 16\u2022]. Recent studies on Y. pestis isolates from Brant's vole plague foci in China have shown these strains (renamed Yersinia microtus) were attenuated in the human host. Microarray and sequencing analysis of these strains shows a specific pattern of loss of particular regions of the genome including five regions that are present in all virulent strains tested [16\u2022]. Additionally, several specific mutations were identified that are present in all Y. microtus strains but absent in human virulent strains. This study has therefore successfully identified regions of the Y. pestis genome responsible for Y. microtus niche-adaptation and for avirulence in humans, as well as mapping the accumulation of deletions in fully virulent Y. pestis strains as they spread among vole populations throughout China.",

Also, 5 additional regions (38 ORFs) were identified to be present in M. bovis strains but absent in some or all of the BCG strains [17]. This is indicative of ongoing genetic changes in BCG strains and offers a possible explanation for the loss of protective efficacy since their original derivation in 1921.

Comparative phylogenomics that use standard microarrays from a range of bacterial pathogens, such as H. pylori, C. jejuni, E. coli and S. aureus, clearly demonstrate the diversity and adaptability of these specialized groups of organisms. Studies have revealed much evidence of lateral gene transfer and recombination. This supports an evolutionary scenario involving vertical diversification by mutagenesis, punctuated by frequent lateral gene transfer, resulting in a global mosaic genome structure. By contrast, M. tuberculosis, V. cholerae and Y. pestis appear to exhibit limited genome diversity, but nevertheless are adaptable enough for pandemic strains to emerge.",

Resequencing arrays are designed to cover the entire genome by overlapping oligonucleotides. Multiple versions of each oligonucleotide are spotted on the array to represent the four possible base combinations (A, T, G and C) for each nucleotide position. Competitive hybridisation of test and control strains to the array allows the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms and small deletions or insertions that would be missed by standard microarrays. To date, this technique has only been applied to Bacillus anthracis, with 56 strains being resequenced using a custom-designed resequencing array [41\u2022\u2022]. As this technique becomes more robust, many more bacterial species will be investigated in this way. The same technique has also been used to track the evolution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [42].",

Currently we are developing an \u2018active surveillance pathogen\u2019 microarray that consists of genes from mobile elements such as pathogenicity islands, phage and plasmid sequences; this will have multiple applications. The active surveillance pathogen array could be used as an \u2018early warning system\u2019 to allow identification of the emergence of highly transmissible or virulent strains that could, for example, be traced back to an individual, or a flock or herd, and then eliminated, thus averting the spread of an emerging virulent strain. No doubt the knowledge garnered from these and other microarray studies will be applied to well-designed intervention strategies to help reduce the burden of infectious disease.",
