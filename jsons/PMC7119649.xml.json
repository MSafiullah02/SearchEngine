            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly recognized infectious disease with significant health and economic impacts worldwide. SARS was initially identified in Guangdong province, China in November 2002 and subsequently in Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam, Taiwan, countries in Europe and in North America by March and April of 2003 (CDC, MMWR 2003a; Lee et al., 2003; CDC, MMWR 2003b; WHO, 2003, Riley et al., 2003). The 2003 SARS epidemic was caused by a previously uncharacterized coronavirus, SARS-CoV (Peiris et al., 2003a, Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003). Typical coronavirus particles were readily visible under electron microscope and the specific coronavirus sequences were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from most SARS-CoV infected patients (Peiris et al., 2003a, Drosten et al., 2003, Lawrence, 2003). SARS-CoV could be isolated and cultivated from sputum specimens and respiratory secretions of SARS patients using Vero cell cultures before the appearance of SARS-specific antibodies in serum, average 21 days following exposure (Peiris et al., 2003b, Booth et al., 2003). The incubation period for SARS ranges from 2 to 10 days, though viremia can be documented approximately 2\u20135 days following exposure. The challenge of early detection of SARS-CoV infection is the low viremia of infected patients. Low viremia yields low to modest specific signal/noise ratio making distinction of the early-infected victims from non-SARS febrile patients difficult.",

Despite enormous efforts to implement extensive control measures, there were still unrecognized cases of SARS that led to nosocomial clusters and subsequent spread to other health-care facilities and community settings in different regions of the world (Twu et al., 2003, Seto et al., 2003). Several factors might contribute to difficulties to recognize cases of SARS. Early symptoms of SARS are nonspecific and more commonly associated with other respiratory illnesses (updated interim US case definition for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), CDC, 12 December 2003). Patients with SARS who are immuno-compromised or who have chronic conditions, e.g. diabetes mellitus or chronic renal insufficiency may remain afebrile when acutely ill or have symptoms attributable to underlying disease, delaying SARS diagnosis. The reappearance of SARS in Toronto, Canada illustrates the possibility that future outbreaks of SARS might occur during the flu season in different parts of the world. Thus, it would not be adequate to rely solely on the preliminary clinical symptoms, such as fever and cough to detect and differentiate SARS-CoV infections from other common upper respiratory infections.",

            "text": "There are various RT-PCR tests to detect SARS-CoV available using different SARS-CoV genomic sequences (Drosten et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003b). The formats of SARS-CoV RT-PCR assays range from conventional agarose gel based assays to fluorogenic real-time RT-PCR assays. Real-time RT-PCR may be preferred format due to its simplicity and ability to generate quantitative data. However, most of the current real-time SARS-CoV RT-PCR assays have not been validated to document consistent detection sensitivity and specificity to detect low SARS-CoV titers during early stages of illness. An expected characteristic of SARS-CoV similar to other RNA viruses, such as flaviviruses is the high rate of genetic mutations, which leads to evolution of new viral variants (Leitmeyer et al., 1999, Mangada and Igarashi, 1998, Sanchez and Ruiz, 1996). It is possible that the high mutation rate of SARS-CoV would render any given RT-PCR assay useless if the assay\u2019s target sequence is subject to mutational changes. Thus, a negative test result may not rule out SARS-CoV infection especially for the patients showing early symptoms of SARS. In this study, we report the development of a real-time RT-PCR assay based on the highly conserved 3\u2032-NCR of the genome as a quantitative SARS diagnostic system (Marra et al., 2003, Ruan et al., 2003). It was retrospectively demonstrated that the assay could be used as an efficient diagnostic to identify SARS-CoV positive samples derived from SARS probable, or suspected patients during Taiwan\u2019s 2003 SARS outbreak.",

The optimal RT and PCR assay conditions obtained were described above, and were used throughout this study. Various concentrations of viral RNA were used to demonstrate the quantitative nature of the assay. Fig. 1a\nshows typical sigmoid plots representing formation of the SARS-CoV specific PCR products from samples derived from Vero cell culture containing five-fold serial dilutions of viral RNA by showing accumulation in fluorescence (\u0394R) as amplification cycle number increases. Threshold cycle (C\nT) for each concentration of cDNA is defined as the cycle number where the application software detects the increase of product fluorescence above the calculated background fluorescence (Holland et al., 1991). The C\nT values for the described viral cDNA concentrations were automatically calculated by application software as the intercepts of the fluorescence signals and the base line of background fluorescence (set as the average of all tested samples from cycle 3 to 15). Parallel sigmoid plots representing serial dilutions of SARS-CoV cDNA template are shown and displayed in sequential order. Higher concentrations of template cDNA resulted in lower C\nT values, i.e. greater initial viral cDNA template copy numbers required fewer amplification cycles or a smaller C\nT value to reach the detectable fluorescence level. These preliminary results demonstrated that the fluorogenic RT-PCR assay was capable of detecting SARS-CoV viral cDNA in a dose-dependent fashion over at least seven serial five-fold dilutions (4.9 logs dilution). In addition, the assay was also capable of discriminating specific SARS-CoV viral stock cDNA from background levels (non-template controls showed no fluorescence signal).",

Live SARS-CoV cannot be safely used in most clinical laboratories and it is also difficult to maintain consistent viral RNA standards for routine usage due to the labile nature of RNA molecules. Therefore, a recombinant plasmid containing the 3\u2032-noncoding SARS-CoV cDNA was constructed to serve as a SARS-CoV genomic equivalence standard. The recombinant plasmid, pHCV1 containing the SARS-CoV 3\u2032-noncoding region was constructed and isolated as a possible SARS-CoV genomic reference standard (see Section 2). Fig. 1b demonstrated that the pHCV1 plasmid can be used as a SARS-CoV genomic copy number standard for the assay developed in this study. The C\nT values of serially diluted plasmid concentration reflect a copy number dependent reaction. The slope of the pHCV1 standard curve (0.28) is identical to the slope of SARS-CoV viral standard curve (see Fig. 2\n). This illustrates that the pHCV1 DNA and viral cDNA can be amplified by the same method with the same amplification efficacy.",

A linear regression model was used to determine the number of infectious units (pfu) present in a given SARS-CoV preparation and the results from this calculation indicates that the ratio of defective to infectious particles could be deduced from the difference of standard curves of assays using viral cDNA preparations as well as the cloned SARS-CoV 3\u2032-NCR. The GE/pfu ratio of 1:1600 was derived from the direct readout of intercepts difference at Y-(GE/pfu).

There are more than forty 3\u2032-NCR SARS-CoV sequences deposited in the GenBank database, and a Blast search demonstrated 100% homology among various SARS-CoV isolates obtained from different parts of the world. It was demonstrated that the 3\u2032-NCR based fluorogoenic RT-PCR developed in this study could be used as an efficient diagnostic assay for laboratory grown SARS-CoV detection and quantification. It was preliminarily illustrated that the assay has a wide dynamic range of detection (more than 4.9 logs) with excellent linearity (linear coefficient greater than 0.99) using cDNA templates derived from serial dilutions of viral RNA through reverse transcription (RT) reaction. The data presented in Fig. 1 showed the detection range of SARS-CoV from 18,000 through 0.25 pfu per assay. The C\nt value of 34 cycles obtained for the 0.25 pfu/assay did not represent the ultimate end point of the assay. It was later demonstrated that the end point, or lower detection limit of the assay could reach as low as 0.005 pfu per assay with the C\nt value approximate at 40 cycles (data not shown). The cloned 3\u2032-NCR SARS-CoV cDNA pHCV1 was also established in this study as a molecular copy standard, or genomic equivalent standard for the SARS-CoV assay. It was demonstrated in this study that the cloned cDNA pHCV1 could mimic the viral cDNA derived from SARS-CoV RNA preparations as a copy number standard for the assay. Fig. 2 showed the minimal detectable pHCV1 copy number of two GE per assay with C\nt value greater than 40 cycles. However, the population size of cloned SARS-CoV standard at two copies per reaction was too small to be represented as a \u201cnormal distribution\u201d (Gaussian distribution). Thus, multiple repeats of the same assay using such a low substrate copy number, two copies per assay would yield the result of \u201chit or miss\u201d phenomenon. In order to obtain more reproducible results of the assay, the cutoff, or end point of pHCV1 for the assay was raised to 6\u20138 GE per assay with the C\nt value at 40 cycles. Based on the calculated SARS-CoV GE/pfu ratio from Fig. 3, and the actual experimental data using serial dilutions of viral cDNA preparations and cloned pHCV1, the lower detection limit of SARS-CoV assay could be conservatively defined as 0.005 pfu or 6\u20138 GE per assay.",

            "text": "The traditional expression for viral titer, plaque-forming unit (pfu) per ml must be determined through a conventional viral plaquing assay. This culturing method identifies viable viruses that can generate cytopathic effects, or plaques, on the confluent lawn of susceptible host cells, such as Vero cells (Drosten et al., 2003). The viral plaquing assay can only be used to score the total viable viruses that can infect the host cells. Thus, it cannot be used to distinguish, or detect any viral contaminants that are capable of infecting the host cells used for the plaquing assay (Porterfield, 1959, De Madrid and Porterfield, 1969). In contrast, the SRAR-CoV RT-PCR assay developed in this study is specific for the SARS-CoV detection. However, the SARS-CoV PCR assay developed from this study cannot be used to differentiate among living versus dead viral particles (Freeman et al., 1999, Bae et al., 2003, MacKay et al., 2002). Any viral particle or genomic segment containing intact PCR target sequence, such as the 3\u2032-NCR SARS-CoV would be detected as one genomic equivalence (GE). The difference between pfu (viable viruses) and GE (total viral counts including defective and functional viruses) of SARS-CoV can be mathematically expressed as GE/pfu ratio (Freeman et al., 1999, Bae et al., 2003). The GE/pfu ratio of approximate 1200\u20131600:1obtained in this study only represents the GE/pfu ratio of the Vero cell derived SARS-CoV stock used in this study. The finding of high GE/pfu ratio from this study supported the hypothesis of SARS-CoV cultures and SARS-CoV infected clinical samples containing both infectious and defective (or subgenomic) viral RNA, i.e. each SARS-CoV infectious unit is represented by multiple viral RNA species. It is likely that the 3\u2032-noncoding based SARS-CoV RT-PCR assay could detect both infectious and defective viral RNA from clinical samples (Poon et al., 2004). It is possible that viral stocks of different preparations might contain the same pfu per ml, but the total viral particles, or RNA copy numbers would be different (Bae et al., 2003, Peccoud and Jacob, 1996). The pfu, infectious activity of any given viral stock is greatly affected by the percentage of viable virus. There are numerous factors that will determine, or affect the viability of each individual viral stock, such as culturing conditions (nutrients, ionic strength, incubation time and temperature), storage conditions (duration and temperature), and viral harvesting conditions. Thus, it is difficult to obtain a universal reference viral stock containing a precisely standardized viral copy number with persistent viability data. It was demonstrated in this study that the cloned pHCV1 plasmid could be used to replace viral cDNA as a stable and rational SARS-CoV copy number standard for the SARS-CoV RT-PCR assay.",

The key to the successful control of SARS outbreaks is to identify SARS-CoV infected individuals in the early stages of infections. This will allow public health officers to apply adequate physical quarantine measures before the SARS infected individuals become highly contagious. This requires the deployment of highly sensitive SARS-CoV diagnostics to detect low SARS-CoV titers. In this study, the assay was used to test a limited numbers of total RNA extracts derived from SARS suspected, or probable patients in Taiwan. The tested results indicated that it is feasible to use the developed assay to identify the SARS-CoV infected patients with viremia loads ranging from 3.59 pfu through 1608.29 pfu/ml. Even though only a limited numbers of samples were tested in this study, the assay was confirmed to be specific, i.e. none of 20 non-SARS ARD patients\u2019 samples tested positive using the SARS-CoV assay. Even though we did not have specific information on the onset dates of disease for those clinical samples tested in this study. We demonstrated that the 3\u2032-noncoding based RT-PCR developed in this study could be used to detect both infectious and defective viral RNA. Thus, the assay should have fairly high diagnostic sensitivity of detecting SARS-CoV during the early stage of infections (Poon et al., 2003). It was previously reported that the mean time between onset of symptoms and sample collection ranged from 3.2 to 4.3 days for SARS-CoV detection directly from nasopharyngeal aspirate using real-time RT-PCR (Peiris et al., 2003a, Peiris et al., 2003b; Tsang et al., 2003). It was proposed to further verify and validate the assay developed in this study by using careful selection panel of reference samples consisting of wide dynamic range of naturally infected SARS samples, i.e. from 106 to 1 pfu/ml as well as SARS negative control samples. However, it is very difficult to obtain credible SARS reference samples with known infectious titers since there is no known major outbreak of SARS after the last multi-country outbreak in 2003. The conserved 3\u2032-NCR feature of other RNA viruses, such as dengue viruses had been reported and utilized to develop type-specific RT-PCR assays for dengue virus identification and quantification throughout the world (Sudiro et al., 1997, Sudiro et al., 1998, Houng et al., 2000, Houng et al., 2001). Thus, it would be reasonable to predict that the 3\u2032-NCR based SARS-CoV specific RT-PCR assay can be used to detect different SRAS-CoV originated from outbreaks of various geographic origins. It was demonstrated that the SARS-CoV 3\u2032-NCR based assay using Canadian SARS-CoV Tor2 sequence could be used to detect laboratory grown SARS-CoV Urbani strain as well as various SARS-CoV infected samples in Taiwan. Based on the assay\u2019s excellent performance capacity (high detection sensitivity at 0.005 pfu/assay and robustness in detecting SARS-CoV of different origins and preparations including direct viral cDNA as well as cloned recombinant plasmid) and superior specifications (100% specificity and 91% amplification efficacy) shown in this report, the 3\u2032-NCR based SARS-CoV RT-PCR should be able to serve as an efficient SARS-CoV diagnostics in the event of future outbreak.",
