We calculate the exact expressions of these quantities, as functions of the SIR parameters, for all connected graphs of three to seven nodes. We obtain the smallest graphs where the optimal node sets are not overlapping. We find that (i) node separation is more important than centrality for more than one active node, (ii) vaccination and influence maximization are the most different aspects of importance, and (iii) the three aspects are more similar when the infection rate is low.",

What \"important\" means depends on the particular scenario-what kind of disease spreads and what can be done about it. In the literature, three major aspects of importance have been discussed. First, influence maximization is aimed at identifying the nodes that, if they are sources of the outbreak, would maximize the expected outbreak size (the number of nodes infected at least once) [6, 7] . Second, vaccination is aimed at finding the nodes that, if vaccinated (or, in practice, deleted from the network), would reduce the expected outbreak size the most [5] . Third, sentinel surveillance is aimed at finding the nodes that are likely to get infected early [8, 9] . These three notions of importance do not necessarily yield the same answer as to which node is most important. In this work, we investigate how the ranking of important nodes for these three aspects differs and why (see Fig. 1 ).",

The authors compare the top results of heuristic algorithms to identify influential single nodes, whereas in this paper we will consider the influence of all nodes, and also all sets of two and three nodes.

[13] is a bit different from ours-they call important nodes for vaccination \"blockers\" and important nodes for influence maximization \"spreaders\".) * holme@cns.pi.titech.ac.jp We will proceed by discussing our setup in greater detail: our implementation of the SIR model, how to analyze the three aspects of importance, network centrality measures that we need for our analysis, and our results, including the smallest networks where different nodes come out as most important.",

This is usually determined by the lead time-the expected difference between the time a sentinel node gets infected, or the outbreaks dies out, and the infection time of any node in the graph [8] . We will instead measure the average discovery time time \u03c4 (i) from the beginning of the infection until a node i gets infected or the outbreak dies [9] .

Panels (b)-(d) show how this outbreak influences maximization (a), vaccination (b), and sentinel surveillance, respectively. The idea of influence maximization (b) is that a node is important if the outbreak originating at it is expected to be large. The idea of vaccination (c) is that a node is important if removing it would reduce significantly the average outbreak size. The idea of sentinel surveillance (d) is that a node is important if a sensor on it would detect the outbreak early. The shades of the nodes in (c) and (d) are proportional to their contribution. In a stochastic simulation, one would average the values over many runs and, for (c) and (d), many seeds of the outbreak. In this work, however, rather than running simulations, we calculate the exact expectation values of these quantities. smallest discovery time is then considered most important for sentinel surveillance. If the purpose of the surveillance is just to discover the outbreak-not to rid the population of the disease as early as possible-one could measure \u03c4 (i) conditioned on the outbreak reaching a sentinel before it dies out. We will briefly discuss such a conditioned \u03c4 and refer to it as \u03c4 .",

This is the smallest graph where the most important single node (n = 1) is different for influence maximization, vaccination, and sentinel surveillance. For [(1 + \u221a 5)/2,(3 + \u221a 17)/4] \u2248 (1.62,1.78), node 6 is the most important node for influence maximization, 5 is most important for vaccination, and 1 is most important for sentinel surveillance. For small \u03b2 values, 6 is most important for all three aspects of importance. In this region, the outbreaks die out easily. The fact that 5 and 6 have a larger degree than the others is, of course, helpful for an outbreak to take hold in the population. Node 6 is slightly more important as a seed node since the extra link in its neighborhood helps the outbreak to persist longer [there are the (6, 7, 4) and (6, 4, 7) infection paths that, although unlikely, do not exist for diseases starting at 5]. This reasoning also explains why 6 is most important for vaccination. For sentinel surveillance and for low enough \u03b2, the outbreak would typically end by the outbreak becoming extinct rather than hitting a sentinel. Thus, for low \u03b2, when an outbreak has the highest chance of surviving if it starts at 6, then putting in a sentinel is good because an outbreak is either instantly discovered or will likely soon be extinct. With a conditional discovery time \u03c4 , the curves are strictly decreasing (since the early die-off is omitted), so 1 is the most important node for all \u03b2.",

If an active node has a high degree, it is likely to be the source of a large outbreak, meaning it is important for influence maximization (which was also concluded by Ref. [13] ). If a high-degree node is deleted, it would remove many links that could spread the disease and thus be important for vaccination [25] . It would also be important not to put a sentinel on a low-degree node for sentinel surveillance and low \u03b2 as diseases reaching low-degree nodes would likely die out. So panels Figs. 6(a) and 6(c) can be understood as a shift from nodes of high degree to nodes of high vitality. Closeness centrality-seen in Fig. 6 (b)-is harder to explain. Values of c increase with \u03b2 for influence maximization but decrease for vaccination. One way of understanding this is from the observation that vitality is most important for vaccination [as evident from Fig. 6(c) ], and degree is most important for influence maximization [as seen in Fig. 6(a) ]. The results of Fig. 6 (b) then suggest that the high vitality nodes optimizing the solution of the vaccination problem have a lower closeness centrality. Indeed, for many of the graphs we study, the highest vitality node has many degree-1 neighbors-cf. node 5 in Fig. 3 -which does not necessarily contribute to the closeness centrality. For influence maximization, it seems that the optimal nodes are central in the closeness sense-the closer to average the seed node is to the rest of the network, the higher is the chance for the outbreak to reach the entire network.",

Panels (b)-(d) show how this outbreak influences maximization (a), vaccination (b), and sentinel surveillance, respectively. The idea of influence maximization (b) is that a node is important if the outbreak originating at it is expected to be large. The idea of vaccination (c) is that a node is important if removing it would reduce significantly the average outbreak size. The idea of sentinel surveillance (d) is that a node is important if a sensor on it would detect the outbreak early. The shades of the nodes in (c) and (d) are proportional to their contribution. In a stochastic simulation, one would average the values over many runs and, for (c) and (d), many seeds of the outbreak. In this work, however, rather than running simulations, we calculate the exact expectation values of these quantities.",
