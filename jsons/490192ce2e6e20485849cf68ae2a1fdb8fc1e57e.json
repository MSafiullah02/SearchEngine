On Jan 12, a second patient was diagnosed, in our gastroenterology department (appendix p 5). On Jan 13, we updated our alerts ( our median times to response were within 1 day. We further discuss and evaluate our approach in the appendix (pp 6-9). Of note, given high rates of community transmission and the large number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in China, the Chinese Society of Gastroenterology recommended withholding immunosuppressive therapies, on the basis of potential increased risk of infection and worsening of COVID-19 disease course, especially in high-risk areas such as Wuhan. 2 However, local guidelines and isolation measures should be dictated by the background rate of COVID-19 in the community. Nonetheless, we believe our experiences could provide a model of care to prevent COVID-19 in patients with IBD. contact with health-care workers), telehealth outpatient visits, and recent symptoms (including fever and respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms). In response, 24 (8%) patients reported risk factors for exposure to SARS-CoV-2, including one patient who reported contact with an individual with confirmed COVID-19 (appendix p 2). As of March 30, none of our registered patients with IBD had reported concern over respiratory symptoms and none had confirmed or suspected COVID-19. COVID-19 was excluded in 29 patients, including 20 patients with disease flare and six active cases, by diagnostic chest CT scans and virological testing.",

We mailed trial drugs to those in clinical trials who lived further from our hospital (>1 h driving distance), to reduce exposure to hospital facilities.

We published online recommended guidelines and precautions for prevention of COVID-19 in the IBD population. 2 On Jan 22, we sent alerts to outpatients to be aware of atypical COVID-19 (ie, confirmed COVID-19 with only gastrointestinal symptoms and no fever) and to maintain selfisolation, and sent alerts via public news media (major newspapers and periodicals) on Jan 24, when the shutdown of Wuhan was announced and domestic social lockdown and quarantine controls were instituted.",
