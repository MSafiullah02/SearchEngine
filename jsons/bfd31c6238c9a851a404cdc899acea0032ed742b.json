Since the 12 TMs exhibited a 2-fold pseudosymmetry, the AcrB crystal structure can be fitted into the transmembrane regions in two ways. The correct fitting was selected based on the connections between TMs and the extracellular domains. The remaining transmembrane helix was TM1. Each TM was manually adjusted in COOT (Emsley et al., 2010) to better fit the EM map. After the assignment of NTD, domain C, and TMD, the remaining map in the extracellular region corresponded to domain I.
