Bacteroides fragilis is considered an important clinical pathogen and it is the most common anaerobe isolated from human clinical specimens producing endogenous infections (Duerden, 1994). Moreover, B. fragilis is also considered to be the most virulent species in the genus Bacteroides due to its virulence factors and its predominance in monomicrobial and mixed infections such as brain, lung, intra-abdominal and intrapelvic abscess, peritonitis and sepsis (Duerden, 1980).",

However, the practise of feeding animal meat and bone to cattle has been linked to epidemics of bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Not only are harmful prions found in the consumed animal products, but so too are heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants. For example, metals such as copper are used extensively as a growth-promoting agent in both industrial and organic animal production (D\u00f3rea, 2004; Hasman et al., 2006). Substances that are resistant to degradation and that are released in the environment accumulate in the food web and often end up being consumed by humans. The chemical characteristics of these substances determine the location of accumulation, the metabolism and the half-life within animal tissues (D\u00f3rea, 2004).",
