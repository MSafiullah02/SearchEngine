It is believed that there are approximately 10\u201315 different choline-binding proteins including PspA, PspC, and LytA that are encoded by S. pneumoniae\n8. After adherence of pneumococcus to a cell surface, further tissue invasion is facilitated by enzymes such as hyaluronidase and neuraminidase. Hyaluronic acid is one of the most abundant glycans in the extracellular matrix of connective tissues,9 while neuraminidase comprising of NanA and NanB, of which NanA is shown to enhance intracellular survival and replication of the bacteria in the lung.10 Being a nasopharyngeal commensal, S. pneumoniae can gain access to the eustachian tube and lungs via the nasopharynx, and can cause middle ear infection and pneumonia, respectively.11 During this process, there is a massive influx of neutrophils driven by proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1. The progression to pneumonia is associated with a viral infection, which can enhance the adherence of S. pneumoniae to the respiratory epithelia and is recognized due to the interactions between the phosphorylcholine of the pneumococcus cell wall and platelet-activating factor receptors that are believed to be upregulated upon cytokine stimulation.12 In addition, various cell wall degradation products such as peptidoglycan, techoic acid, and toxins like pneumolysin are also released following autolysis which can induce inflammatory responses in the host. The various actions of pneumolysin, which include induction of cytokines like TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, disruption of the epithelial cell integrity, decreased bactericidal activity, inhibition of neutrophil migration, and inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation and antibody synthesis, highlight its important role in the pathogenesis of S. pneumoniae.\n13\n",

The first stage is characterized by a bulge or engorgement due to the bacterial presence and serous exudate in the alveoli which provides nutrients to the bacteria and facilitates further infection in the lung.17 The next stage is the intense inflammatory reaction involving leakage of erythrocytes into the alveoli (red hepatisation), followed by the migration of leukocytes into the consolidated area (gray hepatisation), and surface phagocytosis by the leukocytes.18 Due to the intact immune system of the host, normally the type-specific antibodies and the polymorphonuclear leukocytes phagocytise the pneumococci and the lung returns to its normal state. However, in patients with a compromised immune system having certain complement deficiencies or hypogammaglobulinemia (absence of type-specific antibodies), bacteremia can occur and the pneumococcus with its virulence factors (mostly cell wall components such as peptidoglycan, techoic acid, and proteins such as pneumolysin) induce inflammation causing subsequent tissue damage.19\n",

In addition to this, newer PCV\u2019s have been shown to reduce the number of healthy carriers of the pathogen in the community because of \u201cherd immunity\u201d where unvaccinated people are protected from the pathogen.

The pneumonia management strategy with the use of appropriate antibiotics and supportive care including oxygen systems remains an effective cornerstone in the treatment and management of children suffering from pneumonia. The WHO Integrated Management of Childhood Illness program has consistently reported a reduction of childhood mortality rates by approximately 20%, while certain community based management strategies have reported a decrease in 70% mortality due to the usage of oral antibiotics such as amoxicillin.53., 54., 55. The four types of antibiotics recommended for children <5 years of age for the treatment of pneumonia are; cotrimoxazole, amoxicillin, cephalosporins, and macrolides, with oral amoxicillin (40 mg/kg/dose) used for 3 days (nonsevere pneumonia) and 5 days for children with severe pneumonia.56 During severe pneumonia, the first line of treatment is often parenteral ampicillin (penicillin) and gentamicin, followed by ceftriaxone if the first line of treatment is not effective.56 Various randomized controlled studies from the Cochrane database of Systemic Reviews have shown a multitude of available treatments for pneumonia in children with (1) cefpodoxime proving to be more effective than amoxicillin, (2) amoxicillin more effective than chloramphenicol, (3) amoxicillin being an effective alternative to cotrimoxazole for CAP patients, (4) coamoxyclavulanic acid and cefpodoxime as alternative second-line drugs of choice, and (5) penicillin/ampicillin plus gentamicin more effective than chloramphenicol for children hospitalized with severe CAP.57 A 3-year pediatric study of the susceptibility of 208 S. pneumoniae isolates, including serotype 19A, using antibiotics such as second- and third-generation cephalosporins showed significant efficacy against 60\u201370% of the isolates, with clindamycin susceptibility of 60\u201385%, levofloxacin 95%, and ceftriaxone >95%.58 The American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society recommend that hospitalized patients with CAP are preferably treated with a respiratory fluoroquinolone or combination therapy with a \u03b2-lactam and a macrolide.59 The success rates of incorporating the fluoroquninolone or combination with a macrolide based on the clinical, bacteriological, or radiological examinations ranged from 87\u201396%.60 Vancomycin or clindamycin (based on local susceptibility data) should also be provided in addition to \u03b2-lactam therapy if clinical, laboratory, or radiological characteristics are consistent with infection caused by S. aureus.\n61 Although nonsevere and severe CAP have been managed by many antimicrobials as a result of various studies from developing countries that compared different types of antibiotics, there is need for more studies and larger clinical trials for better management of pneumonia in developed countries. Another major health concern is the continual rise in antibiotic resistance with approximately 30% of the isolates being resistant to macrolides including erythromycin, azithromycin, and clarithromycin.62\n",

However, the dosages of antiviral agents currently recommended for seasonal influenza are developed for fully susceptible strains and evaluated in clinical trials mandating the requirement of treatment within 3 days of the onset of symptoms.65 Early antiviral treatment has been shown to provide maximal benefit, and treatment should not be delayed until confirmation of positive influenza test results.

During the early 1970s, infants and children were successfully treated with amoxicillin (40\u201345 mg/kg/day divided into 3 equal doses) because of the susceptible nature of the strains at that time. Resistance to the commonly used antibiotics poses a major problem and concern for health practitioners while choosing an empirical therapy against bacterial pneumonia, and there are large geographical variations indicating different resistance patterns. In the 1990s with the widespread pneumococcal resistance to penicillin, the dosage was increased to \u223c90 mg/kg/day given twice daily for treating children with acute otitis media.67 A recent review has highlighted advances in the understanding of the various mechanisms by which bacteria acquire resistance to antibiotics, how they prevent access to different drug targets, and modulate or inactivate antibiotics.68\n",

The decreased degree of penicillin resistance further prompted a decrease in amoxicillin dosage compared to that administered in the prevaccine era.69 Over the last decade, a certain multicentre clinical trial study has reported a significant decrease in the susceptibility rates of the commonly used antibiotics such as amoxicillin/clavulante, penicillin, and ceftriaxone from 93.8% to 82.7%, 94.7% to 84.1%, and 97.4% to 87.5%, respectively.70 The susceptibility rates of macrolides such as erythromycin and clindamycin were also reported to be decreased from 82.2% to 60.8% and from 96.2% to 79.1%, respectively. Recently, increasing resistance against macrolides has been reported in several European countries, including the United Kingdom. A 3-year surveillance study involving 1545 clinical isolates reported around 26% and 20% increase in the rates of ampicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistance against H. influenzae, respectively, while antibiotics such as ceftaroline, ceftriaxone, amoxicillin/clavulante, and levofloxacin showed 99\u2013100% susceptibility.71 This study also showed increasing resistance of penicillin (96.4%) towards M. catarrhalis, because of the prevalence of \u03b2-lactamase that is known to reduce the susceptibility to penicillins. The resistance to macrolides against M. pneumoniae in children and adults with CAP has been increasingly emerging in countries like Japan, France, Denmark, United States, and China, with rates as high as 40% in Japan, 85% in China, and 3\u201310% in the Europe and the United States.72., 73.

As a result, newer antimicrobials with novel modes of action against multidrug resistant strains are being developed. A recent review has highlighted how combinations of drugs can offer synergistic and antagonistic drug interactions, and how these drug interactions can provide opportunities for discovery of newer drugs.76 In recent years, the availability of new antimicrobials for human consumption has been lower than in the recent past, with no new classes of antimicrobials developed since the introduction of nalidixic acid (1962) and linezolid (2000). The availability of antimicrobials in recent years has mostly been the result of modification of existing molecules. One of the reasons for this is that the development of any new antimicrobial agent is very expensive and time consuming, with research and development of infective drugs taking around 15\u201320 years, and costing around US$1000 million, with further additional costs for bringing the new drug into the market.77 There is a strong need for newer unexploited targets and strategies for the next generation of antimicrobial drugs against drug resistant and emerging pathogens.

Prevention by means of vaccination is critical for reducing pneumonia mortality in children <5 years of age, and an effective antibiotic therapy is important for the elderly. The widespread emergence of antimicrobial resistance is a well-recognized cause of the ineffectiveness of the large number of the currently used antimicrobials. Although numerous efforts have been made to combat this, newer targets need to be identified for the generation of the next level of effective antimicrobials. In addition, a complete understanding of the various aspects of drug resistance in microbes is essential to assist us in designing better targets and help us discover new antibacterial drugs. In the near future, the next challenge will be to identify newer agents for the treatment of multidrug resistant pathogens which are emerging at a rapid rate. The constant and unpredictable nature of pneumococcal pathogens can outpace technological and drug development strategies. Therefore, it is critical for researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and governments and other funding bodies to continue making progress in developing new strategies and antimicrobials towards respiratory infections, including pneumonia.",
