However, previous research has been somewhat segmented and the interactions between pre- and postpartum nutrition and their economic ramifications within the context of beef production systems in an applied production setting are not well established. In addition to influencing cow reproductive performance, nutritional plane both pre- and postpartum has been shown to affect calf growth to the point of weaning (Perry et al., 1991; Beaty et al., 1994; Spitzer et al., 1995). But the persistency of differences in growth rate of calves as a consequence of pre- and postpartum nutrition of the dam beyond weaning is not known.",

However, feeding supplement can be expensive. In the Nebraska Sandhills, subirrigated meadows are a common resource and are dominated by cool-season grass species that provide high-quality forage, which is available postpartum in spring-calving operations. We hypothesized that production costs could be reduced without decreasing pregnancy rates by not feeding supplement and allowing loss of BCS while cows grazed dormant forage prepartum and then regain BCS prebreeding by beginning the grazing season earlier to incorporate high quality forage from subirrigated meadows into the production system. Objectives of this study were to determine the effects of pre-and postpartum nutrition and their interaction in an applied production setting on productivity of the entire system, cow reproductive performance, and calf growth through the feedlot and carcass characteristics.",

Mature cows calving with BCS 5 or greater become pregnant in fewer days than do cows calving with BCS 4 or less; however, increased BCS above 5 at calving does not improve reproduction (Richards et al., 1986). In our study, nonsupplemented cows had a BCS of 4.7 at calving, which may be near the threshold at which increasing BCS no longer improves reproduction. Postpartum nutritional plane influences reproduction (Randel, 1990) but is most pronounced in cows calving in thin to moderate BCS (Wettemann et al., 2003). Increased postpartum nutritional plane improved reproductive performance of cows whose BCS at calving was 4 or less but did not improve reproduction if cows calved in BCS of 5 or greater (Richards et al., 1986). Even though cows fed hay in the current study gained less BCS postpartum, BCS at calving may have been sufficient to prevent improved reproduction in response to postpartum nutritional plane in cows that grazed meadow. We hypothesized it would be important for nonsupplemented cows to graze meadow postpartum to regain lost BCS and achieve acceptable pregnancy rates. A lack of interaction between pre- and postpartum treatments for pregnancy rates would indicate this was not the case. Whereas the practice of managing cows to calve at a BCS of 5 is commonly recommended (Richards et al., 1986; Morrison et al., 1999), results of this study suggest that allowing cows to calve with BCS slightly less than 5 could result in acceptable reproductive performance even under conditions encountered in applied production settings.",

Other studies report increased weight of calves born to cows with greater nutrient plane pre- and postpartum. Beaty et al.

Increased weaning weight of calves nursing heifers fed to gain 0.90 kg/d postpartum compared with calves nursing heifers fed to gain 0.45 kg/d was observed by Spitzer et al. (1995). Houghton et al. (1990) documented greater weight at 105 d postpartum in calves born to cows fed to maintain weight prepartum and of calves born to cows fed to gain weight postpartum compared with calves born to cows fed to lose weight during the same periods. Differences in calf weight still existed at weaning (205 d). Feeding energy-deficient diets, beginning at 100 d prepartum to heifers and 2-yr-old cows resulted in lighter weight at weaning (Corah et al., 1975). Similarly, Perry et al. (1991) reported decreased weight at 70 d of age for calves born to cows fed low levels of energy either pre- or postpartum.",

From the beginning of the experiment (December 1) through calving, 7 calves died when cows were not fed supplement prepartum but no calves were lost during the same period when cows were fed supplement. Differences in diet quality during gestation is a possible explanation for decreased percentage of calves weaned in nonsupplemented cows. This conclusion is supported by the results of Corah et al. (1975) who fed energy-deficient diets prepartum to heifers and 2-yr-old cows and observed decreased percentage of live calves at weaning. Because only pregnant cows were used in the current study, differences in percentage of live calves at weaning cannot be attributed to failure to conceive. Potentially, failure of passive transfer of immunity could explain differences in weaning rate and weaning weight (Wittum and Perino, 1995). In yr 2 and 3, IgG titers of calves between 24 and 48 h after birth were similar (P = 0.98; Table 5) indicating passive transfer of immunity was not different between treatments. These results agree with the findings of Perino et al. (1995) who showed that BCS at calving, ranging from 4 to 7, does not influence IgG titers of calves.",

Ciminski (2002) showed improved growth from birth to slaughter in steers born to cows fed supplemental protein during the last trimester of gestation while grazing dormant upland range in the Nebraska Sandhills. One major difference between the study by Ciminski (2002) and the current study is weaning date. In the Ciminski (2002) study, increased steer carcass weight was observed when cows weaned in November were fed supplemental protein during the last trimester, but increased carcass weight in response to supplemental protein was not observed when weaning occurred in August. The fetus can be buffered from deleterious effects of gestational undernutrition by mobilization of maternal nutrient reserves (Martin et al., 1997). In the current study, weaning in early October may have allowed the cow to accumulate sufficient body reserves that could be mobilized during late gestation to compensate for dietary deficiency. Delaying weaning until November in the Ciminski (2002) study may have depleted maternal nutrient reserves, thus eliminating them as a resource to support fetal growth. Body condition score in nonsupplemented cows at the beginning of the calving season was 4.4 in the Ciminski (2002) study and 4.7 in the current study.",

Similarly, net returns at weaning were increased by $15.05/calf when cows were allowed to graze subirrigated meadow because of increased weaning weight and because grazing subirrigated meadow is less expensive than feeding hay. Net return differences through the feedlot phase were negligible ($0.65/steer) between steers born to supplemented and nonsupplemented cows. Feedlot net returns were $6.11/steer greater for steers whose dams were fed hay during the postpartum treatment period compared with those whose dams grazed meadow. This switch in postpartum treatment with greater net returns for the weaned calf phase vs. the feedlot phase is a consequence of weaning a greater number of heavier, greater-value calves from the meadow treatment, but those greater-value calves finish with an equivalent carcass value to the lighter, lower-value calves from the hay-fed treatment. If the cow-calf operator retained ownership of the steer from birth to weaning, net returns were $45.76/steer greater if supplement was fed to the dam. This increase is almost entirely accounted for by a greater percentage of live calves at weaning and therefore greater percentage of finished steers. Retaining ownership of a steer born to a dam that grazed meadow increased net returns by $8.95.",

Although feeding supplement may not improve pregnancy rates, an increase in percentage of live calves at weaning and weaning weight would improve net returns through the cow-calf phase. Feeding supplement to the dam has no benefit through the feedlot phase for steer calves; heavier calves from the meadow treatment are less profitable through the feedlot phase than are lighter calves from the hay-fed treatment. Allowing cows to graze high-quality forage in the early spring costs less than feeding hay and improves calf growth preweaning.",
