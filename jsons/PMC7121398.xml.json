Despite the high global stakes of this debate and the adoption of the Nagoya Protocol to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 2010, there is no clear pathway for its resolution in sight. ABS is one of the major stumbling blocks in the stalled negotiations on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPs) at the World Trade Organization (WTO), and its current fluid state internationally is the source of different, and at times contradictory, approaches at national levels. In the medium to long term this may adversely affect research and technology transfer prospects. The absence of clear international guidelines further complicates global research initiatives as national governments evolve their own ABS frameworks.1 This situation is frustrating for negotiators, disheartening for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other civil society organizations, and disappointing for many others involved in the process.",

Subsequent trends in the patent regime, however, increasingly reveal a pattern of commercial gain becoming inextricably involved with human genetics research (Hopkins et al. 2007). This is a major departure from the premise on which the Human Genome Project was launched. Since the establishment of the Human Genome Project and the identification of genes in human DNA which play a role in human diseases and disorders, a long moral and political battle has been fought over the extension of intellectual property rights to information contained in human genetic material (Papaioannou 2008) (see also Caulfield 2006; WHO 2009a).",

The expression \u2018genetic diversity\u2019 appears in the Stockholm Declaration (1972), the World Conservation Strategy (1980), the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) General Assembly Resolution (1984) and the Protocol Concerning Mediterranean Specially Protected Areas (1982) (Van Heijnsbergen 1997: 261). The classic example is the report of the UN Conference on the Human Environment (1973) that refers throughout Recommendations 35 to 45 to the need to preserve the world\u2019s genetic resources, yet in Recommendation 40 uses the term \u2018genetic diversity\u2019, where the subject to be protected is referred to as \u2018genetic resources\u2019 (Van Heijnsbergen 1997). The International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources (FAO 1983) refers to genes as part of \u2018genetic diversity\u2019. In this context, Bergman (1986), as quoted in Van Heijnsbergen (1997), observes that biological diversity includes much more than genetic diversity.",

(This quotation includes the related footnote.)4. Human genetic resources64. Medical researchers are increasingly interested in the diversity of the human gene pool as a source of valuable scientific and medical information. The genetic material found in human beings is \u2018genetic material\u2019 as defined under the Convention, in that it is material of animal origin containing functional units of heredity. The collection and analysis of samples of human genetic material from many different ethnic groups around the world could provide insight into the evolution of the human species as well as the nature of human susceptibility and resistance to diseases.43 This value for humanity indicates that these samples constitute genetic resources \u2013 genetic material \u2018of actual or potential value\u2019 \u2013 again fitting a definition under the Convention. Yet from the history of its negotiation, it is clear that the Convention was not formulated with human genetic resources in mind.The collection and use of human genetic resources raises difficult ethical and political issues. For example, the direct, physical interest of affected individuals in their own genetic resources argues strongly for extensive consultations with affected citizens. Given all the serious concerns surrounding this issue, the Conference of the Parties may wish to study the question of human genetic resources and the Convention on Biological Diversity to determine how it may be approached by the Conference of the Parties.___________________________________43 See Anna Maria Gillis, \u2018Getting a Picture of Human Diversity: Population geneticists and anthropologists plan to use variation in human genes to get a sense of Homo sapiens History,\u2019 BioScience 44:8 (994); Mary Claire-King, Celebrating Identity and Diversity: The Human Genome Diversity Project (testimony to the U.S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, April 26, 1993) (CBD 1995b).\n",

Exceptions can occur in the case of research that involves investments by a foreign institution or company, but is conducted in China. For example, a large-scale epidemiology project, led by a researcher at a prestigious UK university, was successfully launched in China in 2004 without reporting to the Human Genetic Resources Management Office (see www.ckbiobank.org). Although the study collects and stores blood samples and extensive health-related data, it does not actually export any \u2018human genetic resources\u2019 out of China. While there is every reason to believe that the research being approved by the university ethics committee and Chinese partner institutions is appropriately obtaining informed consent from participants, this kind of research alerts the office to potential loopholes in the current regulations. How to protect research participants effectively and efficiently, while promoting genuine international cooperative biomedical and pharmaceutical research, therefore remains a major issue.",

            "text": "Notwithstanding the complexity of identifying the origin of the \u2018biological resources\u2019 that constitute the raw material and the focal point of ABS guidelines, there is growing acceptance that some kind of benefit sharing should take place when human genetic material is involved (Schroeder and Lasen-Diaz 2006). We can find examples of this in international debates and guidelines, as outlined in 10.1007/978-94-007-6205-3_3. For instance, the Statement on Benefit Sharing by the Hugo Ethics Committee (2000), the WHO report Genetic databases: Assessing the benefits and the impact on human and patient rights (WHO 2003) and the UNESCO Declaration on Human Genetic Data (UNESCO 2003) have forcefully called for benefit sharing with participating populations in genetic studies. What constitutes benefit sharing in such cases is widely debated, as it may vary depending on the needs, values and cultural parameters in a given case. What is clear, however, is that benefit sharing is considered a key aspect of research involving human beings and human genetic material. Yet, because there are currently no legally binding obligations requiring ABS agreements to be concluded in such cases, there is little evidence that this is actually done in any formal or meaningful manner anywhere in the world. While research groups prefer to offer participating individuals in research studies (which are usually of a clinical nature) free health care as a \u2018benefit\u2019 (see 10.1007/978-94-007-6205-3_5), formal arrangements between the parties appear to be rare.",

This is a commitment incorporating the principles of fairness and equity. It needs to be appreciated that the CBD is fundamentally an effort to protect the world\u2019s biodiversity and to ensure the conservation of all the varied components of the earth\u2019s biological resources, which must include all species. Sustainable use of the various components of biological diversity, with fair and equitable ABS arising from the use of such genetic resources, is an institutional objective towards that goal.

It would be extremely useful if the WHO and CBD would work together more closely and generate common ABS guidelines. It is evident from the technological trends in various streams of biomedical research that clearly delineating the precise sources of a drug will become increasingly difficult as greater convergence is achieved between plant and human genetic resources in drug targeting, selection and development. This will require a far more refined and focused ABS regime. The efforts to address unresolved elements of ABS continue at CBD meetings (Balmford et al. 2005), but certain issues remain outside the scope of the CBD due to its non-inclusive approach to biodiversity. The fact that many of the important human genetic resources for drug development come from indigenous communities makes this a matter of even greater concern (Hammond and Mayet 2009).",

Of these, nearly 5,669 were filed at the world\u2019s three leading patent offices, namely the US Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office and the Japan Patent Office (Hopkins et al. 2007). The growing realization of this valued resource for technology (and product) development has received varying responses from national governments. For example, the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has already issued guidelines restricting the transfer of biological material for collaborative research subject to the approval of institutional review and ethics committees (GOI 1997). These guidelines also discuss the exchange of biological material for commercial purposes and stipulates that approval is on a case-by-case basis with a three-month lead time (GOI 1997). China\u2019s National Office of Administration on Genetic Materials has been revising the 1998 regulation on the administration of genetic material, which specifically regulates the export and import of genetic material (including human genetic resources) in that country. The office has also been concerned with the way ABS is defined and how best to ensure justified benefit sharing in international collaborative studies.",

How would ABS be accomplished for human genetic resources when the source is mixed or unknown? Since implementing benefits from human genetic resources, unlike plant genetic resources, would require not only highly advanced technology but also huge capital inputs, global arrangements for ensuring cost-effective access to medicines will have to be viewed as a priority.
