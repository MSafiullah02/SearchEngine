            "text": "The recent progresses in health care sector have witnessed the use of biomaterials for improving life quality of critically ill patients. Biomaterials have revolutionized a few emerging areas such as biomedical engineering and tissue engineering by facilitating less-invasive techniques for continuous monitoring, improving drug administrating and enhanced mobility by either restoring or replacing organ functions (Hench and Polak 2002; Place et al. 2009; Hubbell 1995). As compared to the conventional technologies, biomaterials with improved functionality and durability have been utilized in form of vascular grafts, biocompatible coatings, medical implants, stents tissue scaffolds which might remain functional even for several months (Place et al. 2009; Ratner et al. 2004). Despite considerable success of biomaterials in ageing society, only a few biomaterials can prove their safety concerns under practically relevant conditions. Regardless of implant composition and applications, i.e., from prosthetic joints, artificial heart and dental implants to vascular valves and intraocular lenses, virtually all biomaterials behave as a \u201cniche\u201d to pathogenic microorganisms (Zaat et al. 2010; Busscher et al. 2012; Stewart and Costerton 2001). Under in vivo conditions, the microbes get attracted and subsequently lead to biofilm formation on biomaterial surface, leading to one of the major clinical complications often referred as biomaterial-associated infections (BAIs) (Percival et al. 2015; Campoccia et al. 2013a; Zaat et al. 2010; Busscher et al. 2012; Stewart and Costerton 2001). The greater incidences of biomaterial-associated infections thus compromise with the intended use of any implant or device and add risk to humans in terms of high morbidity and even mortality (Parsek and Singh 2003; Hall-Stoodley and Stoodley 2009). Moreover, it marks an adverse impact on economy since the existing treatment strategies to cure infection could cost even more than the initial biomaterial implantation. In a broad sense, a biomaterial faces two major challenges when implanted within the body i.e., to make suitable integration with native tissue while preventing colonization of microbes on its surface. In 1987, an orthopedic surgeon Anthony Gristina introduced a phrase \u201cthe race for the surface\u201d referring that there exists a stern competition between tissue integration and bacterial attachment on biomaterial surface (Gristina 1987). A successful implantation of biomaterial without any infection would thus be a \u2018winning\u2019 situation for its intended use, though it is not the case with few of them.",

The cascade for pathogenesis of BAIs follows a series of common events (Costerton et al. 1999; Parsek and Singh 2003; Busscher et al. 2012; Stewart and Costerton 2001). First step involves an initial attachment of microbial cells to biomaterial surface while the attached cells start accumulating in multiple layers leading to the formation of biofilm as a second step. Subsequently, the maturation of microbial biofilm takes place and finally, microbial consortium is detached for spreading to other parts of biomaterial surface. The implants are thus susceptible to many infections, as direct contamination to biomaterial surface during surgery starts even after few hours of implantation i.e., preoperative contamination (Maathuis et al. 2005; Campoccia et al. 2013b). The site of implant can also be accessed to microbes during hospitalization, known as hospital-acquired infections. The spreading of microbes occur due to microbial contamination on several locations other than the implant site through blood stream i.e., post-operative infections and is inevitable (Siegel et al. 2007; Campoccia et al. 2013b). As a result, the durability and functionality of biomaterial implants is severely affected which is manifested by severe complications that arise during patient\u2019s recovery.",

            "text": "The accumulation of microbial biofilm leads to the secretion of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), which tends to hide microbes within its polymeric mesh and make them inaccessible to host immune system and antimicrobial therapies (Costerton et al. 1999; Hall-Stoodley et al. 2004; Hall-Stoodley and Stoodley 2009; Stewart and Costerton 2001). Sessile and adherent bacteria are thus intrinsically more resistant towards host clearance and require nearly 500\u20135,000 times higher concentration of common clinical antibiotics than planktonic or non-biofilm forming pathogens (Boucher et al. 2009; Donlan and Costerton 2002; Subbiahdoss et al. 2013). The therapeutic and prophylactic use of antibiotics for curing post operative infections has even contributed towards the development of microbial strains with high resistance against those drugs making conditions unmanageable. Ultimately, the removal of an infected implant would be the only possible solution followed by weeks of antibiotic treatment to remove infection before implantation of new device (Maathuis et al. 2005; Campoccia et al. 2013b; Busscher et al. 2012; Ratner et al. 2004). For these reasons, local or topical administration of antibacterial agents is preferred over routine systemic approaches which would minimize an initial attachment of bacteria on implant surfaces. Accordingly, a promising strategy for reducing the occurrence of BAIs is to prevent an initial attachment of bacteria to implant and device surfaces (Bazaka et al. 2012; Salwiczek et al. 2014; Monteiro et al. 2009). This has spurred research efforts on developing antimicrobial surfaces and coatings that can be applied to biomedical devices so as to confer resistance against bacterial colonization. To achieve this, the antibacterial biomaterial surface should reflect non-cytotoxic characteristics against mammalian cells and it should not pose any adverse effects on healthier tissues and body fluids of patients (Harding and Reynolds 2014; Norowski and Bumgardner 2009). Moreover, therapeutic approaches to inhibit bacterial colonization yet retaining the intended properties of biomaterials is always advisable, such as the visual clarity of contact lenses or the flexibility of vascular grafts would not be compromised.",

            "text": "In last few years, nanotechnology has provided immense opportunities to manipulate substances at nano scale altering their physicochemical properties and transform them into potential antimicrobial agents. Owing to its small size, nanomaterials have high surface area to volume ratio which makes them more effective even at relatively lower dose concentration than their bulk form (Mauter and Elimelech 2008; Sharma et al. 2009; Rai et al. 2009; Singh et al. 2008). Moreover, the mechanism of antimicrobial action of nanomaterials can be mediated through several pathways, i.e., disruption of bacterial membrane, formation of holes and pits on cell wall, generation of ROS, binding to sulfhydryl groups of metabolic enzymes of the bacterial electron transport chain to inhibit respiratory activity, and integration with DNA (Kumar et al. 2008; Morones et al. 2005; Rai et al. 2009; Hill 2009; Zhang et al. 2012a; Pan\u00e1\u010dek et al. 2006; Sharma et al. 2009; Chopra 2007). This provides inability of microorganism to develop resistance against them. Recently few reports have elucidated a more efficient, direct contact killing action of silver nanoparticles to the bacterial cell wall, which do not even require the internalization of nanoparticles into the cells and thus would be more efficient than antibiotics to inhibit bacterial resistance. As a result, nanomaterials are particularly very effective to kill the multiple drug resistant microbial strains. In particular, the inherent antimicrobial properties of coinage metals i.e., silver, gold and copper were known to us from ancient times, these metallic nanoparticles have been utilized by researchers as potential disinfectants in biomedical and water purification applications (Atiyeh et al. 2007; Russell et al. 1994). They are being introduced as one of the important component in our daily life style. Imagine an odorless textiles (antibacterial T shirts) to public hygiene (deodorants, toothbrushes, washing machines) to water purifier to processed foods packing material, to antibacterial bandages, sunscreen lotions, and cosmetics that you would certainly feel the existence of nanomaterials. More recently, silver nanoparticles are used in the coating of medical equipments such as catheters, infusion systems and dental composites. In addition, there is increasing interest in utilization of \u2018nanoparticulate\u2019 forms of metal, metal oxides like copper/copper oxides, zinc oxides (ZnO) and biopolymers which exhibit remarkable antimicrobial properties.",

            "text": "Despite this, materials at nano scale pose certain challenges which limit their development as an efficient antimicrobial agent. In the absence of any support material, the nanoparticles tend to aggregate due to their high surface reactivity such that their actual antimicrobial efficacy is severely inhibited (Gupta and Silver 1998; Li and Lenhart 2012; Morones et al. 2005; Agnihotri et al. 2012, 2013, 2015). Moreover, colloidal nanomaterials cannot be used repeatedly and thus seem to be uneconomical under practically relevant conditions. Over past few years, tremendous research activities have been focused to minimize these limitation by either immobilizing or incorporating nanoparticles onto solid support with an aim to enhance their antibacterial activities and promote their reusability (Agnihotri et al. 2015, 2012, 2013; Zhou et al. 2014; Bakare et al. 2016; Cao et al. 2010; Lin et al. 2013; Ifuku et al. 2015; Zheng et al. 2016; Chernousova and Epple 2013). In general, various immobilization approaches fall in one of three categories; (1) incorporation and entrapment of segregated nanoparticles inside a porous matrix, (2) simultaneous in situ generation and immobilization of nanoparticles on to a support matrix and (3) immobilization of nanoparticles on a surface functionalized solid support. Among all approaches, one common procedure that would facilitate a stable association between nanoparticles and the support matrix is the selection of appropriate surface modification methods. However, the choice of the method to be employed for immobilization would certainly depend on many other factors such as type of solid support used, size/shape, morphology, surface functionalization and stability of nanoparticles, and the kind of application for which it is used. For example, a low-moderate level of immobilization may give the desired signals for optical/biosensor applications (Johnsson et al. 1991) while, a relatively higher level of immobilization would always be desired for the long term antibacterial effects. Moreover, in order to develop a antimicrobial biomaterial, the physical behavior of a biomaterial during nanomaterials integration must be in compliance with clinical requirements (Stickler 2000). For example, the mechanical specifications of antimicrobial biomaterial would be desirable for a very high load as in case with hip and knee implants. On the other hand, a biomaterial should either have high transmittance for designing intraocular/contact lenses or should be highly elastic while fabricating artificial blood vessels. In many cases, haemocompatibility and cytocompatibility of a biomaterial is compromised while introducing the nano-antimicrobial component, which ultimately would lead to immunological rejection of implant. A thorough understanding of the interaction of nano antimicrobial moiety with the biological environment like proteins, cells and tissue, is therefore crucial in order to be able to improve the functionality of nano-biomaterial interfaces.",

Greeks and Romans used silver coins and vessels to disinfect potable water and keeping the milk fresh (Hill 2009). However, silver based antimicrobial therapy was first documented by Ravelin in 1889 which demonstrated that silver when used in ultra low concentration, proved to be highly germicidal (Zhang et al. 2012a). In late eighteenth century, eye drops constituting of 2% silver nitrate solution were also used to thwart the ocular infections in newborns which lead to blindness and against the treatment of typhoid and anthrax. In 1920s, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) agency has recognized colloidal silver as an effective agent to manage wound healing (Chopra 2007). Silver was then continued as a promising strategy for controlling infections during burns till World War II, which outraged its role with huge demands and development of new antibiotics (Dunn and Edwards-Jones 2004). However, such a heavy use of antibiotics lead to the development of drug resistant microbial strains which propelled the researchers to find novel remedies based on silver. In concurrence with growing interest in exploiting materials at nano level, nano silver has shown the highest level of commercialization (Agnihotri et al. 2014). Silver nanoparticles constitute an important component in nearly 57% (435 out of 762 products) of nano enabled consumer products (health care and fitness sector) available in market (Vance et al. 2015). As a result, AgNPs have emerged as the most exploited antimicrobial nanomaterial in diverse applications such as cosmetics, textiles and fabrics, dietary supplements, food packaging, surgical coatings, silver dressings, water sanitation and disinfection (Rai et al. 2009; Chen and Schluesener 2008; Dunn and Edwards-Jones 2004; Raghupathi et al. 2011; Dorobantu et al. 2015; Gajbhiye and Sakharwade 2016).",

These results might be possible due to higher penetration rates of small sized nanoparticle owing to their high surface to volume ratios (Chen and Schluesener 2008; Rai et al. 2009). The antimicrobial property of AgNPs is governed by several other factors such as shape, aggregation state, stability, dispersion medium, types of capping agents, and methods of surface functionalization of nanoparticles. Even similar sized nanoparticles show variation in antimicrobial action against two different strains of same microbial species, known as strain-specific biocidal killing (Agnihotri et al. 2014; Mukherji et al. 2012; Ruparelia et al. 2008). Regarding shape, the truncated AgNPs appear to be more potent than spherical AgNPs in terms of their antimicrobial efficacies (Pal et al. 2007). However, spherical AgNPs are usually preferred over other shapes due to their ease in synthesis, control on particle size, handling and recovery for use either as colloidal state, or immobilized form (Agnihotri et al. 2013, 2014).",

In disk diffusion studies, the sensitivity of a microbe is tested by calculating the diameter of zone of inhibition (ZoI) created by nanoparticles-laden disc by inhibiting the microbial growth surrounding that disc. Thus, a higher value of ZoI would indicate a more sensitive microbial strain and a more effective antimicrobial nanomaterial (Fig. 1). On the other hand, the liquid broth assay is used to quantify the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of nanoparticles as shown in Table 1. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is defined as the minimum concentration of antimicrobial agent that inhibits the visible growth of microbes whereas, the lowest concentration of biocidal agent that kills 99.9% of microbial population is termed as minimum bactericidal concentration (Ruparelia et al. 2008).\n\n",

Out of several methods (physical, chemical and biological) explored for producing silver nanoparticles, biological methods are gaining enormous interest due to its eco-friendly, non-toxic nature and often synthesize AgNPs with higher antimicrobial properties than that of produced by any other means (Pan\u00e1\u010dek et al. 2006; Sharma et al. 2009). For instance Nanda and Saravanan (2009) investigated the antibacterial activity of biogenic AgNPs (160\u2013180 nm) using S. aureus and found that these NPs showed excellent biocidal efficacy against clinically pathogenic multidrug resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multidrug resistant Staphylococcus epidermis (MRSE), and S. pyogenes. Similarly, Ingle et al. (2008) reported the extracellular synthesis of AgNPs using Fusarium accuminatum, isolated from infected ginger and demonstrated nearly 2\u20133 times higher biocidal activity of AgNPs than bulk silver (Ag+) against highly pathogenic bacterial strains i.e., MRSA, Salmonella typhi, S. epidermidis, and Escherichia coli. Results revealed that the antimicrobial activity of silver nanoparticles is 2.4\u20132.9 times that of silver ions. In a recent study, AgNPs (average size, 19\u201354 nm) synthesized using whole plant extract and callus extract of Linum usitatissimum demonstrated good efficacy against pathogenic strains E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and S. aureus (Anjum and Abbasi 2016). Similarly, Shanthi et al. (2016) used cell free extract of Bacillus licheniformis to produce 18\u201364 nm AgNPs which exhibited strong antibacterial and antibiofilm properties against Vibrio parahaemolyticus Dav1. Silver nanoparticles synthesized through green route have also demonstrated good antimycotic activity against various fungal species viz, Candida albicans, Dermatophyte Trichophyton and Mentagrophytes (Pan\u00e1\u010dek et al. 2009; Rodrigues et al. 2013). These strains are among few of the most common pathogens that cause hospital-acquired sepsis in immunocompromised patients with nearly 40% mortality rate (Pan\u00e1\u010dek et al. 2009).",

Admittedly, the growing concerns for single usage disposable items that have succeeded in reducing the chances of infection in hospitals are made up of polymeric materials. However, the major drawback associated using polymers is that they also provide the necessary surface for microbial contamination, colonization, migration and somehow mimic the conditions require for their subsequent biofilm formation (Hall-Stoodley et al. 2004; Hall-Stoodley and Stoodley 2009). As a result, a large portion of hospital acquired infections (HAIs) are spread through surface contacts with disposable syringes, blood sachets, bottles, pipings, hospitals furniture/wardrobes, which are mostly based on polymeric (polypropylene and polyethylene) materials. It was estimated that roughly 80% of hospital-acquired urinary tract infections originate from urinary catheters, which are of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) origin (Curtis 2008).",

Moreover, the presence of AgNPs would impart an additional biocidal feature to polymer without compromising its properties desired for a particular application. For the preparation of polymer/metal nanocomposites, metals can be incorporated via two approaches; (1) ex situ, in which pre synthesized nanoparticles are incorporated into the surface modified polymeric matrix and (2) in situ, in which polymeric matrix acts both as a nano reactor for synthesizing nanoparticles as well as a template for their subsequent immobilization. The immobilization is achieved through surface modification that allows favorable interaction between the nanoparticles and the support matrix. Although the current discussion is limited to the incorporation of AgNPs on to polymeric template, similar methods can also be employed for immobilization copper, gold, ZnO nanoparticles in later sections.",

The polymeric support can be fabricated into various structures such as nanofibers, thin films, solid support and porous gel that act as a template for immobilizing silver nanoparticles (Mukherji et al. 2012). Among various structures, nanofibers have emerged as the most promising biomaterial scaffolds owing to its nano scale architecture similar to natural human tissue along with microporous morphology which facilitates adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of cells for tissue engineering application (Dahlin et al. 2011). Nanofibers posses a high surface area to volume ratio while its characteristics such as composition, biodegradation, and mechanical strength can be manipulated to the intended role, which is beneficial for other biomedical applications as well (Peng et al. 2016). For example, Almajhdi et al. (2014) incorporated AgNPs (1\u20137 wt%, 5\u201310 nm diameter) on polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanofibers through electrospinning process (Fig. 2) and the antibacterial activities were tested against five pathogenic strains E. coli o157:H7, S. aureus ATCC 13565, Bacillus cereus EMCC 1080, Listeria monocytogenes EMCC 1875 and S. typhimurium ATCC25566 using disc diffusion method. PLGA nanofibers with 7 wt% AgNP demonstrated the best antimicrobial action displaying the highest ZoI (10 mm) against all tested strains. PLGA/Ag nanofibers were found to be suitable for therapeutic applications since they enhanced the anticancer activity along with the biocidal nature without posing any cytotoxicity effects to normal cells.\n",

Interestingly, polymers from natural sources offer many advantages over synthetic ones which make them suitable as biomaterials in regenerative medicine and therapeutics (Allen et al. 2015). Being natural, they are inherently biocompatible, biodegradable, renewable, nontoxic and are relatively cheaper (Dang and Leong 2006). Moreover, natural polymers are easy for chemical modifications thereby improving the structural and functional properties required for the biomaterials (Allen et al. 2015). With this approach, several biocidal agents including AgNPs have been incorporated on natural polymers after surface functionalization in order to enhance their utility as nano-antimicrobials in biomedical applications.",

As compared to pristine PVA/Cs, presence of nano ZnO and AgNPs increased the mechanical strength (from 0.055 to 0.205 GPa), demonstrated good visibility and UV-shielding effects along with excellent antimicrobial properties against Salmonella choleraesuis and S. aureus strains. Recently, a cellulose-chitosan hybrid nanocomposites containing a unique blend of AgNPs and antibiotic gentamicin was prepared for wound dressing applications (Ahamed et al. 2015). For preliminary experiments performed on rats, the physicochemical and biochemical studies revealed faster healing pattern in wounds while the presence of AgNPs ruled out the chances for contamination. The authors claim this nanocomposite as an eco-friendly wound dressing material for humans after being successfully implemented on other animals. Zahran et al. (2014) described an eco-friendly approach for synthesizing Ag/alginate nanocomposite using a one step in situ reduction of Ag+ ions in alginate solution, which acted as both reducing and stabilizing agent. The resulting nanocomposite was applied on cotton fabrics so as to testify its antimicrobial potential on clinical isolates. The modified cotton fabrics showed excellent antibacterial activity towards E. coli, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa strains. A slight reduction in the antibacterial efficacy of modified fabrics was observed when used repeatedly for 20 washing cycles, however 90% bacterial killing was still achievable with such high number of washing steps. Authors claimed this NC as a promising approach for fabricating antibacterial finishing for wound healing purposes. Similarly, Ag/collagen based hybrid nanocomposites have been exploited as tissue scaffold for promoting biocidal response against E. coli, P. mirabilis, B. cereus, and S. aureus pathogens (Mandal et al. 2012). Due to their good mechanical strength, biological functionalities and potential to immobilize metallic nanoparticles, collagen based scaffolds can successfully be utilized in fabricating prosthetic heart valves. Polymers isolated from non-primate sources such as crustaceans (chitosan, chitin), Bombyx mori (silk fibroin) has also been employed as a bio-template for in situ production of AgNPs besides acting both as a reducing agent and stabilizer to prevent their aggregation (Fei et al. 2013; Lavorgna et al. 2014). The resulting nanocomposites have demonstrated efficient killing of MRSA, S. epidermidis, and K. pneumoniae with disruption of biofilm formation afterwards. Nevertheless, the scientific advancements prompted towards establishing polymers-silver nanocomposites as an ideal antimicrobial biomaterial are still poised with several challenges such as broadening their applicability while combating against virulent pathogens.",

The Ag/NSP composite having 20 ppm AgNP concentration were translated into an effective biocompatible material by further mixing with PEU which showed no cytotoxic responses to mouse skin fibroblasts (L929 cells) and human hepatoma cells (HepG2), yet exhibiting complete bacterial killing (99.9%) of E. coli cells (Fig. 5).

Another study hypothesizing the dual role of antibacterial action of Ag/SiO2 based nanocomposites was given by (Agnihotri et al. 2013) where a high localized immobilization of AgNPs (8.6 nm, average size) was achieved on an amine-functionalized silica substrate using 3-(2-aminoethylaminopropyl)trimethoxysilane as a cross linker molecule. The bactericidal potential of AgNP\u2013glass nanocomposite was tested against two E. coli strains, MTCC 443 and MTCC 739, and one Bacillus subtilis strain, MTCC 441, in both deionized water and phosphate buffer medium. The antibacterial tests were performed independently at two different initial bacterial concentrations i.e., 103 and 105 CFU ml\u22121, where bacterial counts were reduced to zero within 120 min under all the test conditions. It was concluded that contact killing is the predominant bactericidal mechanism and surface immobilized nanoparticles showed greater efficacy than other sources of silver (free AgNPs, bulk Ag and bulk AgCl) and released even less than 25 ppb of silver in solution (Fig. 6). Interestingly, AgNP\u2013SiO2 substrate was reused 11 times without losing its bactericidal efficacy. This indicates that the proposed immobilization protocol could prove to be effective while minimizing the toxicity issues associated with excess release of AgNPs into solution as required in case with antimicrobial coatings, especially for surgical devices and synthetic implants.\n",

However, for higher conc. of AgNPs (i.e., 128 mg), POSS-PCU- demonstrated a 50% reduction in platelet adhesion as with pristine POSS-PCU. While comparing the morphology of the platelets, the positive controls (Collagen and PTFE) showed the existence of platelets in a highly aggregated state with extended pseudopodia. In contrast to this, the platelets treated with Ag incorporated POSS-PCU showed a very few platelets with a rounded appearance at their initial state of adhesion.

The size (diameter) of nanotubes is considered to be an important factor for assessing the bactericidal potential of CNTs since SWCNTs are more lethal to microbes than MWCNTs (Kang et al. 2008). Through gene expression data, it was evidenced that E. coli expressed a higher levels of stress-related gene products when treated with SWCNTs as compared to MWCNTs. The enhanced toxicity of SWCNTs is attributed to their sharp edges which acted as nanosyringes for inducing a direct contact to microbes thereby causing damage to cell membrane (Afzal et al. 2013). In addition to this, the presence of carbon nanotubes in Ag-CNTs nanocomposite serves many purposes. First, CNTs act as an immobilizing template for dense localization of silver nanoparticles owing to its high surface area. Secondly, CNTs may undergo simple surface functionalization procedures and the modified CNTs can offer the required nucleation sites for in situ synthesis of AgNP via forming stable silver-CNTs complexes (Wildgoose et al. 2006). Most importantly, Ag-CNTs often mediate synergistic antibacterial effect due to the inherent bactericidal action of CNTs and thus strengthen their antimicrobial performance in addition to being acted as an immobilizing substrate material (Akhavan et al. 2011; Yu et al. 2014; Seo et al. 2014; Rangari et al. 2010).",

This indicates that bacteria were proliferating more over the surface of pure HA and CNTs whereas the addition of Ag particles resulted in the inhibition of bacterial growth and bacterial proliferation was retarded. Later, the same group reported synthesis of ceramic biomaterial based on Ag/HA/CNTs for minimizing bacterial infections for bone replacement prosthesis (Herkendell et al. 2014). Introducing small amounts of silver (2\u20135 wt%) demonstrated a profound antibacterial effects as the bacterial adhesion was reduced to 60% in contrast to pure-CNTs and pure-HA who promoted bacterial growth on their surface by 8.5%. Several other approaches have also been applied to synthesize Ag/CNTs nanocomposites employing biocompatible, environmental benign molecules such as dendrimers (Murugan and Vimala 2011), PMMA (Rusen et al. 2014), and liposomes (Barbinta-Patrascu et al. 2014) which demonstrated excellent antibacterial activity against various pathogens strains B. subtilis, S. aureus, E. coli, and E. faecalis.",

            "text": "The development of toxic free biomaterials has become a great challenge in recent times. The chemical procedure for synthesizing Ag-carbon nano hybrids mainly involves the use of either sodium borohydride or hydrazine hydrate as reducing agents. These chemicals are inflammable, toxic and potentially hazardous, and their left over residues persists in the system despite several washing steps. As a result, they elicit cytotoxic effects both under in vitro and in vivo conditions and limit the applicability of synthesized biomaterial for long term use. Synthesis of nanocomposites by green method using some biocompatible reducing agents can potentially eliminate this problem. Recently, Yallappa et al. (2015) proposed a green method for synthesizing Ag-MWCNTs composite using Terminalia arjuna bark extracts under microwave irradiation. In this study, AgNO3 precursor was introduced in aqueous dispersion containing MWCNTs and the biological extract. The phytochemicals present in the extract acted as reducing and stabilizing agent such that AgNPs were synthesized in situ and subsequently grown on the surface of MWCNTs. The hybrid nanocomposite was found to be very effective against bacterial and fungal strains, which are the causative agents for hospital-acquired infections. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated on the basis of disc diffusion studies, where the zone of inhibition (ZoI) was calculated in the range from 10\u201316 mm for bacterial strains and 7\u20138 mm for fungal strains. While comparing the antibacterial results with pristine MWCNTs, the order of bactericidal and antifungal potential of Ag/MWCNTs was observed as E. coli > S. typhi > S. aureus > P. aeruginosa and C. albicans > T. rubrum \u2248 C. indicum, respectively. Authors explained this enhanced antimicrobial activity of nanobiohybrids as a combined effect of CNTs, AgNPs, and the presence of phytochemicals from plant extract in the dispersing media. These results suggest that the biohybrid nanomaterials can compete with commercial antimicrobial agents.",

The potential for using graphene based nanocomposites in films and coatings applications has been rapidly expanded over the past decade. Graphene is considered as a biocompatible material towards mammalian cells and osteoblasts while graphene oxide has been utilized as a carrier matrix to deliver bioactive agents and drugs into the cells. Hu et al. (2010) described a novel route for synthesizing graphene-based antibacterial paper via introducing several functional groups (hydroxyl, epoxy, and carboxyl) over graphene sheets enabling it to be water dispersible. The antibacterial activity of graphene paper was validated by observing a significant reduction (up to 70%) in metabolic activity of E. coli DH5\u03b1 cells and suppressing bacterial growth up to 98.5% in presence of GO nanosheets. In another study, Wang et al. (2015) investigated the antibacterial potential of reduced graphene oxide/magnetic NPs/polyethylenimine nanocomposite onto which AgNPs were grown through in situ approach. The resulting biomaterial exhibited excellent antibacterial performance against model strain, E. coli O157:H7 with 99.9% killing rate (initial bacterial count, 107 CFU ml\u22121) using a dosage of 0.1 \u03bcg ml\u22121 followed by a photothermal treatment (5 min) under a near-Infrared (NIR) laser irradiation. Moreover, a MBC value of 0.1 \u03bcg ml\u22121 could be achieved under near infrared (NIR) laser irradiation for 10 min, while no colony of E. coli O157:H7 was found in solid agar plate. The strong absorbance characteristics of graphene in NIR has been exploited in another study (Tian et al. 2014), where AgNP/GO/iron oxide nanocomposite showed synergistic antibacterial effect against E. coli and S. aureus strain. Moreover, due to the presence of iron oxide nanoparticles, the antibacterial composite were recoverable and hence can be used repeatedly.",

It was a single-step synthesis protocol and was performed under mild atmosphere without involving any hazardous chemicals or specific process conditions. Electron microscopy studies indicated that the presence of DOPA not only facilitated the intercalation of HNTs within GO sheets, it also caused reduction of silver ions to AgNPs and their subsequent attachment to both HNTs and graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets (Fig. 7). Synthesized AgNPs were found to be in a range between 5\u201315 nm through TEM micrographs. The antibacterial experiments indicated a very high bactericidal potential of Ag/HNTs/rGO (reduced graphene oxide) towards E. coli and S. aureus having MIC value of 2 \u00b5g/ml as compared to their control groups, i.e., Ag/GO (16 \u00b5g ml\u22121), Ag/HNTs (32 \u00b5g ml\u22121), colloidal Ag (64 \u00b5g ml\u22121) and GO nanosheets (1064 \u00b5g ml\u22121).

Results indicate while no inhibition zone was observed for pure GO samples during 24 h of incubation, both GO\u2013AgNPs and CNS\u2013AgNPs showed a clear zone of inhibition (ZoI) even after an incubation period of 8 h. However, as the incubation time was increased to 12, 20, and 24 h, the no. of viable colonies were much lesser in CNS\u2013AgNPs treated samples as compared to GO\u2013AgNPs for same strains under similar test conditions. The antifungal activity of GO, GO-AgNPs and CNS\u2013AgNPs also was evaluated by liquid culture assay broth micro dilution method. The MIC values of CNS\u2013AgNPs against C. albicans and C. tropical strains were calculated as 0.25 and 0.125 mg mL\u22121, respectively. On the contrary, GO\u2013AgNPs demonstrated a higher MIC value of 0.5 mg mL\u22121 against both fungal strains. In order to elucidate the enhanced antifungal activity of CNS-AgNPs over GO, scanning electron microscopy was employed (Fig. 8). The SEM micrographs indicated that no significant morphological change was observed in C. albicans and C. tropical cells treated with pure GO. However, both fungal strains treated with CNS-AgNPs demonstrated a distinct damage to cytoplasmic membrane such that their intracellular contents were leaked completely. Moreover, release of silver ions from CNS-AgNPs also caused a more severe effect such that a clear concave zone was observed in the cell membrane. Similarly, a hydrogel based contact lens has recently been tested as antimicrobial biomaterial comprising of quaternized chitosan, AgNPs and graphene oxide (Huang et al. 2016). Contact lenses loaded with AgNP and GO demonstrated good mechanical properties and excellent antifungal efficacy under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. Authors indicated its therapeutic use as drug delivery vehicle for the treatment of fungal keratitis, a severe ocular disease in developing countries which often leads to blindness and ocular morbidity. Analogous antimicrobial performance of various silver based nanocomposites and their biomedical applications has been summarized in Table 2.\n\n",

Another expanding area where hydrogels have gained enormous attention is in wound dressings and coating surgical devices to prevent nosocomial infections. Other than being non-toxic, hydrophilic, biocompatible and biodegradable, hydrogel exhibits several other remarkable properties such as oxygen permeability, good adhesion and easy handling, which make them an ideal candidate for biomedical applications (Peppas et al. 2006; Hoffman 2012; Zhu and Marchant 2011; Jones and Milton 2000). Especially for wound healing purposes, the water holding ability of hydrogel keeps the wound hydrated and prevents scar formation, which is inevitable several times. Moreover, their low abrasion characteristics and ability to supply nutrients in a controlled manner accelerates healing process and alleviate pain. Some commercial hydrogel based products like Hydrofiber\u00ae and Aquagel\u00ae are already in the market which allow to keep a moist environment around the wound site and promotes wound healing (Jones et al. 2006).",

First, hydrogels suffer with poor mechanical durability which restrict their applications in several domains such as tissue engineering and corneal implants where tough and flexible properties are specifically needed (Zhu and Marchant 2011). Secondly, with few exceptions, hydrogels are generally more susceptible to get infected and their applications at the infected site may elevate the risk of spreading infection to surrounding tissues (Jones and Milton 2000). Integration of nanotechnological advances to hydrogel thus have succeeded to minimize these limitations and extended its accepted applications beyond treating sloughy and necrotic wounds. Reinforcing hydrogel with nanomaterials such as silica nanoparticles, graphene oxide, carbon nanotubes, clay nanosheets as nanofillers have tremendously improved their mechanical strength. On the other side, introduction of nano-antimicrobials to hydrogel is becoming an utmost concern for its clinical relevance in much needed areas such as prostheses, ocular surgery, biodegradable sutures, and coating surgical implants and devices.",

As compared to synthetic polymers, polymers having natural origin (cellulose, starch, chitosan, alginate, etc.) are increasingly utilized for biomedical applications due to their biocompatible, biodegradable and low cost attributes.\n",

They investigated that there exist a synergism between AgNPs and chitosan, responsible for the enhanced antibacterial action of hydrogel against S. aureus, E. coli, S. epidermidis, and P. aeruginosa strains. Moreover, the hybrid gel contributed toward inhibiting the maturation of their biofilms whereas no harmful effects on the viability of keratinocytes and fibroblasts cells were observed through the biocompatibility tests. Another natural polymer isolated from microbial strain Acetobacter xylinum TISTR 975 i.e., bacterial cellulose was tested as an immobilizing template for AgNPs (Maneerung et al. 2008). Silver nanoparticles were synthesized in situ within bacterial cellulose by introducing polymeric material into AgNO3 solution followed by the borohydride mediated reduction. The resulting hydrogel exhibited good physicochemical properties and a strong bactericidal performance against E. coli and S. aureus strains. Panacek et al. (2014) synthesized sodium polyacrylate stabilized AgNPs (size 10 nm) and incorporated into methylcellulose to form a hydrogel based nanocomposite which could be used as a potential topical antimicrobial formulation for treatment of burns and wounds. The hybrid nanocomposite showed excellent antibacterial and antifungal efficacy against infective pathogens S. aureus, C. albicans, E. coli, P. auregenosa, S. epidermis with MIC values of 25 mg L\u22121. As claimed by the authors, this material could act as a barrier preventing the attack of microorganisms causing infections at wound site.",

SEM analyses indicated that semi-interpenetrating network of hydrogel not only facilitated a controlled and uniform distribution of AgNPs (Average size, 13 nm), it also precluded the requirement of adding any stabilizer to keep AgNPs in segregated state (Fig. 10). Swelling studies confirmed that the incorporation of silver incorporation enhanced the porosity and chain entanglement of the polymeric species of the hydrogel.

To this polymeric mixture, sodium borohydride was introduced as to convert silver ions into AgNPs yielding hydrogel\u2013silver nanocomposites. The antibacterial tests performed in solid agar demonstrated a significant and distinct ZoI while good antibacterial activity was observed against E. coli strains using liquid broth assays.

Results indicated that chitosan-AgNP hydrogels always mediated higher antibacterial performance than pure chitosan under relevant conditions, regardless of the bacterial species tested.

The antimicrobial efficacy of AgNP-hydrogel composites were determined on the basis of variation in the apparent lag phase and growth rate of S. aureus and S. epidermidis cells. Results indicate that hydrogel with 0.1 mM AgNP concentration demonstrated a better antibacterial activity than hydrogel having lower (0.5 mM) AgNP content. The maximum antibacterial effect of AgNP-hydrogel was achieved in 48 h while a further increase in contact time marked no increment in its antibacterial activity. Moreover, the presence of AgNPs did not pose either any cytotoxic effects on osteoblast cells or rheological characteristics of hydrogel.

In a recent article, Loo et al. (2014) demonstrated the importance of AgNP-PVA hydrogels as antimicrobial coating on commercial endotracheal tubes. The antibacterial potential of hydrogel nanocomposite was evaluated on the basis of their degree of colonization on its surface after desired durations. Results showed that the density of P. aeruginosa colonization on pure PVA hydrogels was estimated to be in the range of 2.2\u20135.5 \u00d7 103 CFU cm\u22122 after 6 h of incubation whereas, no adherent bacterial colony was found on AgNP loaded PVA hydrogel for initial 6 h.

Similar trend was observed in case of S. aureus strains attachment to the hydrogels surface. Moreover, exposing hydrogel to human normal bronchial epithelial (BEAS2B) cells showed no cytotoxicity consequences. In another perspective, incorporating AgNPs into PVA matrix enhanced Young\u2019s modulus and ultimate tensile strength whereas its elongation at break was decreased than pristine PVA hydrogel. The mechanical property of hydrogel was found to comparable with commercially available endotracheal tubes and hence their utilization as antibacterial coatings for preventing nosocomial infections was envisaged by the authors.

Chitosan is a deacetylated form of chitin derivative which is a linear copolymer of N-acetyl glucosamine and glucosamine. Owing to its poor solubility in both aqueous and organic solvents, chitin polymer limits its practical applications and was widely accepted in the form of chitosan, which provided ample opportunities for further development (Dash et al. 2011). Moreover, chitosan offers some extraordinary properties such as innate biocompatibility, biodegradability, intrinsic antimicrobial efficacy, bone forming capability, and wound healing knack difficult to achieve with any other natural or synthetic polymer, making it a promising biomaterial to be used in various biomedical applications (Dash et al. 2011). With the shift of dimension from macro to nano, chitosan nanomaterials have also been shown to have expansive antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal activity (Rabea et al. 2003), which depend upon several factors, including pH, degree of deacetylation, and the type of solvent (Tavaria et al. 2013; Chung et al. 2003).

Due to its excellent mucoadhesive nature to a variety of hard and soft tissues, chitosan based hybrid materials may serve as a temporary skeleton in bone tissue engineering (Ca\u00f1as et al. 2016). Fortunately, most of the chitosan based formulations has not been reported to provoke either inflammatory responses or allergic consequence within human body which has established its wide acceptability and utilization as biocompatible implants, injection, oral ingestions, topical applications for diverse biomedical purposes. Chitosan films/membranes has been tested as an efficient biomaterial for wound healing applications (skins, burns) and coating implants, thanks to its innate antimicrobial nature which inhibits biofilm formation yet promoting cell (e.g., fibroblasts, keratinocytes) proliferation for epidermal regeneration (Bla\u017eevi\u0107 et al. 2016). For example, Qi et al. (2004) synthesized chitosan and copper loaded chitosan nanoparticles (CSNPs) based on ionic gelation interaction between positively charged chitosan and negatively charged tripolyphosphate molecules. The processing was operated at room temperature and copper ions were absorbed on to CSNPs via ion exchange resins and/or surface chelation respectively. The average size of pure CSNPs and Cu-loaded CSNPs was calculated as 40 and 257 nm, respectively through AFM. These NPs showed effective antibacterial activity than their pristine counterparts against E. coli, S. choleraesuis, S. typhimurium, and S. aureus with MIC values ranging between 0.01 and 0.13 \u00b5g ml\u22121. AFM analyses revealed that CSNPs severely killed S. choleraesuis cells via membrane disruption such that membrane permeability was severely damaged resulting in the leakage of intracellular components. In another study, a synergistic antibacterial activity of Cu loaded CSNPs was observed against E. coli K88 strain with MIC (9 \u00b5g ml\u22121) and MBC values 21\u201342 folds lower than the individual antibacterial entities i.e., copper ions and chitosan nanoparticles (Du et al. 2008).

They found that among modified NPs; N,O-CMC NPs showed maximum antibacterial efficiency than O-CMC and CSNPs, with 100% inhibition rate at a maximum concentration of 1 mg ml\u22121. The greater antibacterial effect of N,O-CMC NPs was attributed to their relatively higher degree of substitution of carboxymethyl groups on chitosan than unmodified chitosan, (Sun et al. 2006). Earlier, It was hypothesized that the introduction of carboxymethyl groups strengthen the overall positive charge on chitosan molecules, resulting in greater interaction with negatively charged components (lipopolysaccharides, proteins) present in the bacterial membrane, thereby causing membrane disruption and release of major content of intracellular material outside cells (Sudarshan et al. 1992).",

In order to combat this problem nanoscale systems with antibacterial properties are being developed as a biological carrier materials to inhibit biofilms formation, maturation and growth. For the above mentioned reasons endodontic irrigants like sodium hypochlorite have been used for successful elimination of biofilms but these irrigants when retained in higher amounts for longer period of time may even cause more structural damage into the dentin (Zhang et al. 2010). Also, they leave smear layers because of incomplete elimination of bacteria and hence there is a need of chelating agents used as final irrigant to get rid of smear layers from the root canals (\u00c7alt and Serper 2002). However the chelates may cause additional damage by compromising the mechanical integrity and amplified bacterial adherence on collagen (Kishen et al. 2008). Inspired by this approach, de Paz et al. (2011) tested the antibacterial efficiency of chitosan nanoparticles prepared from chitosan (high and low mol. wt.) against Streptococcus mutans biofilms. Confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) image analysis showed high antibacterial potency of low MW CSNPs with more than 95% destruction rate of bacterial cells as compared to 25% killing rate for high MW CSNPs. In line to this, a recent study has demonstrated the chelating and antibacterial effect of CSNPs to remove the smear layer and inhibit bacterial colonization on bovine dentin (del Carpio-Perochena et al. 2011). Results showed noteworthy chelation and antibacterial potency of NaOCl-EDTA, NaOCl-EDTA-CNPs and NaOCl-CNPs in comparison with that of the control and NaOCl groups, with 73% of live cells in case of NaOCl-EDTA-CNPs compared to 92% of control. This establishes the fact that CSNPs can be used as anti-biofilm and chelating agent in dental applications, however, further work on the above issues is needed.",

For example, Romainor et al. (2014) demonstrated the potential of CSNPs (216 nm) doped cellulose films as an antibacterial wound dressing material. Disk diffusion assays revealed that while pure cellulose film could not exhibit any inhibitory effects on bacterial growth, no colonies were able to grown on the surface in contact with either chitosan-doped or chitosan nanoparticles-doped cellulose films. It was hypothesized that being polar in nature, both chitosan and CSNPs were able to diffuse slowly from films to agar plate, facilitating a direct contact killing action. The polar nature of film was further increased after cross linking with citric acid, which demonstrated a larger diameter of zone of inhibition i.e., an enhanced bactericidal potency of CSNP-doped cellulose films, validating the above hypothesis. The antibacterial assays showed the highest activity against E. coli with 85% and 81% inhibition rate in bacterial growth at 5% and 10% doping concentration of CSNPs and chitosan in cellulosic films, respectively. The value MIC and MBC values of CSNPs/cellulose films were determined as 10 and 13 \u00b5g ml\u22121 respectively, which was significantly lower than the bulk chitosan/cellulose films (MIC: 16.37 \u00b5g ml\u22121; MBC: 19.70 \u00b5g ml\u22121). Similarly, Jamil et al. (2016) developed cefazolin loaded chitosan nanoparticles (CSNPs) and tested their antimicrobial activity against K. pneumoniae, P. aeroginosa and extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) positive E. coli. Antibiotic loaded CSNPs showed ZoI ranging from 15 to 22 mm with increasing concentration of drug from 200 to 2000 \u00b5g ml\u22121. It indicates that CSNPs can be used to fabricate antibacterial agent for effective therapeutic solutions against MDR bacteria and can be employed in antimicrobial coatings on medical devices.",

GNPs are appropriate to deliver drugs to cellular addresses due to their ease in fabrication, functionalization, biocompatibility and their ability to cross cellular barriers while interacting with cell surface lipids (Huang et al. 2009). On the other hand, antibacterial efficacies of GNPs can be increased by adding antibiotics (Grace and Pandian 2007; Rai et al. 2010) whereas on conjugating with target-specific biomolecules, GNPs can be used as powerful therapeutics to destroy even cancerous cells. Gu et al. (2003) synthesized vancomycin-conjugated GNPs exploiting the strong binding affinity of gold to thiol (\u2013SH) groups such that the antimicrobial activity of vancomycin was significantly improved on coating with gold nanoparticles (5 nm) against vancomycin resistant Enterococci (VRE) well as E. coli. These gold NP conjugates were more effective than vancomycin itself against various bacterial strains. Similar findings were presented in another study (Huang et al. 2007) where polygonal shaped GNPs after immobilizing vancomycin were used as an effective photothermal agents for the selective killing of VRE, MRSA, and other potentially drug-resistant microorganisms. Authors revealed that the dual functionalities of GNPs (to absorb near-infrared radiations) and vancomycin (binding with the terminal D-Ala-D-Ala moieties of the peptide units of bacterial cell wall) contributed towards its photothermal destruction with high efficiency without eliciting any toxic effects on human cells.",

(2006) also demonstrated that ciprofloxacin-encapsulated gold-silica nanoshells mediated enhanced antibacterial activity as compared to free ciprofloxacin against E. coli DH5. The ability of Cefaclor, a second-generation antibiotic for synthesizing GNPs showed potent antimicrobial activities on both Gram positive S. aureus and Gram-negative bacteria E. coli strains (Rai et al. 2010). As compared to individual components, GNPs-antibiotic conjugate facilitated more severe perforations in bacterial cell wall followed by disrupting the bacterial DNA leading to cell death. Demurtas and Perry (2014) created a proficient drug delivery/carrier system by conjugating stable GNPs with antibiotic amoxicillin (a member of the penicillin family) which also reduced the chloroauric acid to form nanoparticles (30\u201340 nm) and simultaneously coated them to afford the functionalized nanomaterial. Figure 12 shows the comparative antibacterial performances of pure amoxicillin, pure GNPs and amox-GNPs conjugates with various proportions over duration of 4 h. Results indicate that amoxicillin-conjugated GNPs showed an enhancement in antibacterial potency against E. coli as compared to the antibiotics and GNPs alone. The conjugated form exhibited 100% inhibition of E. coli growth in minimum time (2 h) with an MIC value of 300 \u03bcg ml\u22121. Authors claimed that these GNPs conjugates can be used to coat a wide variety of biomaterial surfaces for instance implants, fabrics for treatment of wounds and glass surfaces to maintain hygienic conditions in the home, in hospitals and other infected prone areas (Das et al. 2009).\n",

The combined antibacterial and antifungal activities of GNPs on conjugating with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU, anti-cancer drug) was also testified against Micrococcus luteus, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus niger (Selvaraj and Alagar 2007). 5-FU conjugated GNPs were found to be more effective on Gram negative bacteria than Gram positive due to their easier permeability into the cells.

For example, Chen et al. (2010) synthesized lysozyme-protected gold nano clusters combining the individual antibacterial properties of lysozyme and gold nanoclusters which inhibited the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as Acinetobacter baumannii and vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (VRE). Zaporojtchenko et al. (2006) produced an antibacterial metal/polymer nanocomposite coating system employing Ag/Au together with polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) film having thickness between 100 and 300 nm. Higher antimicrobial effect of Ag\u2013Au/PTFE nanocomposite coatings was estimated as compared to either individual Ag/PTFE or Au/PTFE as manifested by evaluating the extent of inhibition of S. aureus and S. epidermidis model bacterial strains. Marsich et al. (2011) prepared a nanocomposite hydrogel based on natural polysaccharides alginate and chitlac with incorporated GNPs (Average size, <20 nm). A good antimicrobial efficacy of these hydrogels was tested against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa though the GNPs containing nanocomposites showed some cytotoxic effects towards eukaryotic cell lines HepG2 and MG63. Recently, a novel biodegradable hydrogels based on gold nanocomposites was synthesized using acrylamide and wheat protein isolate through an environmentally benign route (Jayaramudu et al. 2013). GNPs were synthesized by reducing HAuCl4 using neem leaf extract (Azadirachta indica) within the hydrogels network with an average size of 10 nm. The gold-nanocomposite hydrogel showed potential applications for wound/burns dressings as it exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against S. pyogenes and E. coli with ZoI 0.9 cm and 1 cm respectively, however it was entirely absent for hydrogel without GNPs. Zhou et al. (2014) synthesized cellulose nanofiber mats by alternatively depositing negatively charged GNPs (Average size 18.7 nm) and positively charged lysozyme through layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly technique. Multiple functional moieties present in lysozyme provided the necessary electrostatic interactions required for binding GNPs and lysozyme to the supporting substrate. The resulting GNPs/lys/cellulose LBL multilayer assembly was found to be highly stable while exposing them under dilute acid, alkali and surfactant solutions. These film coated mats were tested against E. coli and S. aureus which showed good antimicrobial potency for food packing, tissue engineering, wound dressings applications. The fabrication process for GNPs coated cellulose mats is shown in Fig. 13.\n",

Copper materials combined with metals like cadmium and lead have been considered for sanitary and hygienic purposes since 1980s because of its biocidal activity against a varieties of microbes (Domek et al. 1984; Gould et al. 2009). CuNPs are currently gaining enormous interests due its low cost, availability and are considered to be practically more safe for humans (Grass et al. 2011; Longano et al. 2012b). In addition to this, CuNPs exhibit excellent antimicrobial activity against a varieties of clinically relevant pathogens including bacteria, fungi, and algae while a recent few reports have demonstrated their antimicrobial and catalytic efficacies similar to other metallic nanoparticles, i.e., silver and gold (Wei et al. 2010; Usman 2013) with intrinsic antimicrobial activities. Nano copper is considered as a potential candidate for new generation of antimicrobials since in trace amounts it is necessary for the execution of several metabolic processes in organisms (Krupanidhi et al. 2008) and at the same time it shows bactericidal activity at a relatively higher dose due to membrane disruption, nucleic acid and protein damage (Gant et al. 2007) and ROS production (Pelgrift and Friedman 2013; Longano et al. 2012b).",

In 2005, they first reported the synthesis of bioactive coatings made from polymeric thin films loaded with copper nanoparticles for antibacterial and antifungal applications (Cioffi et al. 2005b). Copper nanoparticles (average size, 3.2 nm) were synthesized employing a novel electrochemical method under an inert and stabilizing environment. The synthesized CuNP were embedded in polymer matrices of polyvinylmethyl ketone (PVMK), poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) followed by spin casting the resulting solution on to some substrate in order to get Cu-polymeric mixture in form of films with an average thickness of 400\u2013500 nm. The bioactivity of three nanocomposites was screened against S. cerevisiae (yeast), E. coli, S. aureus, Lysteria monocytogenes, and molds, where CuNPs-PVMK films exhibited the strongest biostatic effect with more than 99.9 and 95% inhibition of bacterial and molds colonies, respectively. The higher antimicrobial activity of Cu nanocomposites was attributed to their higher release kinetics of Cu into the solution which was in turn linearly correlated with CuNPs loading. CuNPs-PVDF nanocomposites showed minimum antibacterial activity since the amount of Cu loading among all three coatings followed order as PVMK > PVC > PVDF. Authors envisaged the application of these CuNP based nanomaterials for the preparation of antibacterial coatings in household, biomedical and hospital, which are prone to receive infections. In another study, (Cioffi et al. 2005a), same research group investigated the electrochemical synthesis of copper and silver core-shell nanoparticles (range, 1.7\u20136.3 nm) using tetraoctylammonium (TOA) salts as both base electrolyte and stabilizing agents to NPs. The nanocoatings formed after incorporating them onto PVMK polymer showed an extraordinary inhibitory effect on both eukaryotes and prokaryotes microbes, thanks to the synergistic action of nanoparticles and tetraoctylammonium as potential disinfectants. The enhanced physicochemical properties with good stability of Cu nanocoatings thus prompted the authors to find applications in antifouling paint and coating formulations. In a different study, CuNPs synthesized using laser ablation method were deposited on to polylactic acid after drop casting so as to make a self assembled antimicrobial film. The resulting nanocomposite showed good bioactivity against Pseudomonas spp. which is the most causative pathogen in food processing (Longano et al. 2012a).",

The hybrid nanofibers demonstrated a noticeable antibacterial activity against E. coli with a MIC value of 5 CFU cm2 when composites were loaded with 4% wt. of copper had. In addition to this, the presence of cellulose provided the required mechanical strength to alginate nanofibers for holding CuNPs for intended applications.

Ahmad et al.

The antibacterial properties of CuNPs coated cotton substrates were assessed in solid media using zone of inhibition assay and growth inhibition assay in liquid broth. ZoI results indicated while ActicoatTM (a commercial silver dressings) exhibited the largest zone of inhibition, which is an indicative of high Ag+ ions release from sample into the solid agar medium, CuNP-cotton nanocomposite did not shown any distinct ZoI, thanks to non-leachable CuNPs that were bound firmly to the functionalized cotton surface. Contrary to this, CuNP-cotton caused a 8 log reduction in growth of A. baumannii in liquid assay within 10 min of incubation as compared to merely 1 log reduction for bacterial cells treated with AgNP-cotton samples. Moreover, CuNPs coated cotton exhibited more effective bacterial killing than ActicoatTM despite having approximately 90% less metal cm\u22122. Authors envisaged the enhanced bactericidal killing of Cu-coated cotton samples to be predominantly contact killing activity, a similar mechanism of action proposed by (Agnihotri et al. 2013) in a different study related to immobilized silver nanoparticles.

For instance, Narayanan et al. (2012) synthesized ZnO NPs of size ranging between 41\u2013167 nm by precipitation method using zinc nitrate and NaOH. The antimicrobial activity was tested against common human pathogens such as S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, and P. aeruginosa with an average ZoI of nearly 21, 17, 13, 16, and 30 mm for respective strains at 100 \u03bcg concentration of ZnO NPs. In addition to this, the biogenic synthesis of nanoparticles can alleviate various limitations associated with the involvement of toxic chemicals and reagents through chemical approaches. For example, the antimicrobial efficacies of ZnO nanoparticles synthesized using green (average size, 40 nm) and chemical (average size, 25 nm) approaches were tested against various bacterial and fungal pathogens viz. S. aureus, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, and fungal strains Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus nidulans, Trichoderma harzianum, and Rhizopus stolonifer (Gunalan et al. 2012). Amongst the various tested bacterial strains, ZnO NPs showed the highest antimicrobial activity against S. aureus as demonstrated through a larger ZoI (26 mm) than P. mirabilis (27 mm), S. marcescens (24 mm) and C. freundii (19 mm). Among fungal pathogens, the order of antifungal effect was noticed as R. stolonifer > A. flavus > A. nidulans > T. harzianum. Interestingly, ZnO NPs synthesized through green route exhibited enhanced antibacterial & antifungal activity than chemical ones, despite having larger nanoparticle size. Several other studies have also reported the improved antimicrobial potency of ZnO NPs synthesized through green routes over chemical approaches (Gnanasangeetha and Thambavani 2013; Salem et al. 2015; Sharma et al. 2010).",

Antimicrobial activity and stability of ZnO nanoparticles can be improved by incorporating them into some carrier matrix. Moreover, ZnO in the form of nanorods can even act as an immobilizing template for other nano-antimicrobials like AgNPs and may contribute towards an unprecedented antimicrobial performance. For instance, Agnihotri et al. (2015) described a facile approach for dense immobilization of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on ZnO nanorods using arginine molecule as an eco-friendly cross linker. Various characterization studies indicated that arginine molecules provided numerous nucleation sites on ZnO nanorods forming stable silver-arginine complexes, which was subsequently reduced into silver nanoparticles (Fig. 15). The resulting Ag/ZnO hybrid nanocomposite (HNC) demonstrated an extraordinary antibacterial activity against E. coli and B. subtilis strains under the given test conditions. A dual mode of bactericidal action of HNCs, i.e., mediated through direct-contact as well as release of silver ions was hypothesized. Ag/ZnO HNCs showed no significant reduction in antibacterial efficacy even after being recycled multiple times. A good extent of immobilization was confirmed by measuring the amount of Ag and Zn release in potable water which was found to be well below the USEPA recommended standard. Interestingly, the Ag/ZnO HNC did not show any cytotoxic effects on the human hepatocarcinoma cell line (HepG2) and no significant generation of ROS was observed by the treated cells after an exposure of 24 h. The immobilized substrate thus showed good biocompatibility and sustained bactericidal activity and has good potential as a nano-antimicrobial biomaterial.\n",

The plaque inhibition potency of polymer/ZnO nanocomposites were examined against various strains Streptococcus sobrinus, which is known to cause dental caries and possesses a superior adherence on tooth surfaces as compared to other Streptococcus species. The MIC and MBC values of ZnO NPs against S. sobrinus were found to be 50 and 150 \u00b5g ml\u22121, respectively while the incorporation of 10% ZnO-NPs in polymeric resin reduced biofilm growth by 80% as compared to polymeric resin without ZnO NPs.

On a similar account, higher biofilm coverage was observed on pure polymer resin after 3 days of incubation whereas, 10% ZnO/polymer nanocomposite showed significantly less colonies of S. sobrinus attached on its surface which discouraged the formation of a continuous biofilm layer.",

Moreover, a significant change in cell morphology was also observed and the existence of more rounded cells was attributed to cytotoxic consequences of ZnO NPs. Thus, nanofibrous composite with 5% ZnO was considered as a suitable material for wound dressing applications by providing good antibacterial activities yet remaining non cytotoxic.\n",

(2014) synthesized a potential wound dressing/healing nanocomposite films using bacterial cellulose with different concentrations of ZnO NPs (size range, 70\u201390 nm). The antimicrobial efficacies of nanostructured films were tested against E. coli where an introduction of 1 and 2% ZnO to cellulosic depicted a ZoI of 34 and 41 mm, respectively. Also, there was a significant up gradation in thermal, mechanical and biological properties of composites with addition of ZnO NPs. The resulting nanocomposites were also found to be non toxic and biocompatible to be used in biomedical applications. In a similar sense, several other polymeric and inorganic nanocomposites have been translated as an effective antimicrobial coating material for medical implants, devices after incorporating ZnO NPs which remain active for months without posing any cytotoxicity to human cells (Sudheesh Kumar et al. 2012; Applerot et al. 2010; Schwartz et al. 2012). A summary of various ZnO based nanocomposite and their biomedical applications are shown in Table 5.\n",

            "text": "The demands for high living standards and hygienic disciplines call new challenges for exploring some advanced, reliable but effective antimicrobial agents that should be environmentally benign and extremely safe for human use. Moreover, there is a daunting concern about the reoccurrence of drug-resistant microorganisms in infection prone areas such as hospitals, where the development of new antimicrobial materials for therapeutics, antisepsis or disinfection purposes are anticipating new strategies for employing them under clinically relevant conditions. In this context, nanotechnology is playing major role in some high priorities areas such as biomedical implants, surgical devices, catheters, stents, and antimicrobial coatings where the application of nano-antimicrobials based on metallic nanoparticles (silver, gold, copper/copper oxide), zinc oxide, chitosan nanoparticles along with their hybrid nanocomposites have been evaluated at various parameters such as their broad spectrum antimicrobial nature, efficacy, reusability and potential cytotoxicity towards mammalian cells. Each nanomaterial has shown its advantages and limitations therefore, accepting an ideal strategy or procedure for developing the antimicrobial biomaterials is not feasible. However, in future the involvement of \u201ctranslational research\u201d for making nano-antimicrobial biomaterials needs to be urgently constructed so as to implement the actual transformation of laboratory research for the realization of product for commercial applications.",
