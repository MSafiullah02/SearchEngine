Polymerase chain reaction is performed for HIV and hepatitis C virus. Risk of missing the detection of infectious agents occurs in the \u201cwindow period\u201d between exposure and positive testing. A high risk especially involves hepatitis B virus due to its long window period; vaccination for hepatitis B virus reduces this risk. Other rare viruses and diseases include West Nile virus, herpesviruses, parvovirus B19, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and severe acute respiratory syndrome. Current standard testing does not detect these infections; nevertheless, viral transmission via blood components is very rare.3,\n4\n",

Moreover, incubating the recipient's serum with commercially available group A and group B red cells demonstrates the presence of specific alloantibodies, confirming the ABO blood type. For example, blood type A shows the recipient's red cell agglutination with commercial anti-A antibodies and commercial group A red cell agglutination with the recipient's serum.

Unbound antibodies are removed by washing RBCs with 0.9% NaCl. An antiglobulin reagent (rabbit anti-human IgG or IgG plus complement) is then added. A positive test shows red cell agglutination, reflecting the presence of allo- or autoantibodies. Allo- versus autoantibodies are determined by a commercially available panel of red cells, varying with antigen phenotype. Agglutination of all red cell panels indicates autoantibodies (e.g., patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia). By contrast, specific reactivity indicates alloantibodies (e.g., patients with alloimmunization). The direct antiglobulin (Coombs') test detects antibodies or complement on the surface of red cells. Washed recipient's red cells are incubated with antiglobulin reagent (rabbit anti-human IgG or IgG plus complement) as in the IAT. Agglutination is observed if antibodies or complement are present on the surface of red cells. A crossmatch with an ABO- and Rh-compatible unit of blood determines whether the recipient's serum contains unexpected antibodies to the donor's red cell antigens.",

If the antibody screen is positive, the specificity of the antibody is identified; if clinically significant, only red cells negative for the relevant antigen will be transfused. A full crossmatch is also performed. Additional time is required to identify the antibodies, find antigen-negative red cells, and perform full crossmatch tests.

Each unit usually contains approximately 200 ml of RBCs, 70 ml of plasma, and 100 ml of additive nutrient solution (e.g., citrate [as an anticoagulant], phosphate, dextrose, and ATP). Clinical citrate toxicity (hypocalcemia due to calcium chelation) is rare, occurring only with massive transfusions (e.g., exchange transfusion), and responds to calcium supplements. Prolonged storage produces a leakage of potassium into the plasma, which is usually clinically insignificant.

A single unit (prepared from 1 unit of whole blood) should contain greater than 5.5 \u00d7 1010 platelets, which raises the platelet count by 6 to 10 \u00d7 103/mm3 in adults. Transfusing 4 to 6 pooled random-donor units of platelets for adults and children greater than 20 kg (1 unit/10 kg for children < 20 kg) raises the platelet count by 25 to 50 \u00d7 103/mm3 (see Table 132-2), which is usually adequate for supporting hemostasis (see Table 132-2).5 Platelets are also prepared from blood from a single donor with the use of blood cell separator machines, yielding a platelet product (apheresis) equivalent to that of 5 random units. For adults and children greater than 20 kg, a platelet transfusion requires 1 single-donor apheresis unit (10 ml/kg for children < 20 kg) (see Table 132-2).1,\n5 This type of product (apheresis unit of platelets) aims to minimize donor exposure and is recommended for patients requiring chronic transfusion.5 If the intention is to transfuse a small volume (e.g., in infants), an apheresis unit of platelets can be divided into two aliquots.",
