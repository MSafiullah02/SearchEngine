Indeed, one study reported that 30% of hospitalized subjects don't make 140 antibodies to the virus [3] . For example, one of the 4 hospital-provided NAT+ serum samples 141 yielded an OD within the range of the control samples. Hence, we concluded that setting a 142 specific cut-off to declare samples SARS/CoV-2 positive or negative will require compromising 143 sensitivity or specificity. Accordingly, as all archived sample fell within 2.6 SD of the group 144 mean, we set a cut-off of 4 SD above that mean as a threshold to indicate that an individual had 145 likely been exposed to SARS/CoV-2. If values had a normal distribution, such a cut-off would 146 provide over 99% specificity. This cut-off result was met by 3 of 4 community-collected NAT+ 147 samples. The IgM assay was harder to validate in that, as one might expect, the 4 hospital-148 provided convalescent serum samples were all within the range of the archived samples. Hence, 149 based on overall analysis of our data and other studies, we set a cutoff of 3 SD to indicate likely 150 recent exposure to SARS/CoV-2. Based on this cutoff, 2 of our 4 community-acquired NAT+ 151 samples, including the one that was negative for IgG, were positive for SARS/CoV-2 anti-IgM. 152 .
