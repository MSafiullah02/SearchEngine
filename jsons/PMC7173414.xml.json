            "text": "\nA high quality radiograph requires optimal radiographic density, adequate contrast, minimal patient motion and proper patient positioning (Owens, 1999). High quality radiographs must be obtained for accurate interpretation and assessment. A radiograph exposure technique chart is essential for consistent high-quality radiograph production. Most poor quality radiographs are due to operator error or inadequate techniques (Ewers, 2000; Stender, 1990). Since radiograph exposure technique charts are based on anatomic thickness (in centimeters), formulating a chart for small primates is relatively easy. As thickness decreases it becomes easier to visualize the different densities within that thickness (Ferron, 1967). However, as mass increases radiograph exposure technique charts must be tailored precisely to the anatomical study (Ferron, 1967). In addition, short exposure times (1/60 or 1/120 seconds), fast film screen systems and effective patient restraint, eliminate most motion artifacts. Nonhuman primates require either physical or chemical restraint for proper patient positioning. Unfortunately, this restraint may also alter the radiographic technique or quality.",

It may persist in subsequent generations of captive-born group housed macaques. Treatment with ivermectin can eliminate the infection, but the lesions of chronic bronchiolitis, bronchiectasis, and pigmentation may persist as an incidental finding (Lowenstine, 2003). The typical radiographic manifestation of pulmonary acariasis in rhesus macaques consists of an increased nonstructured interstitial pulmonary density, increased thickness and density of the bronchial walls, increased peribronchial density, pleural thickening, pleural adhesions, indistinct pulmonary vasculature and cavitary pulmonary lesions. Follow-up radiographs usually demonstrate minimal or no progression of the peribronchial and interstitial densities in uncomplicated cases. Pleural thickening is a prominent radiographic finding; the interlobar fissures are thickened and irregular, differing from their normal thin, smooth appearance. Pleural adhesions are common. Cavitary pulmonary disease consisting of bullae and subpleural blebs can be extensive. The most frequent complication of pulmonary acariasis is pneumothorax. Because, of the complete separation of the mediastinum of the macaque, unilateral pneumothorax occurs frequently (Silverman and Morgan, 1980a).",

However, ionic and nonionic iodinated media are less sensitive for the detection of mucosal lesions and may not demonstrate a perforation or a fistula. In addition, nonionic iodine contrast is hypertonic, drawing fluid into the intestinal lumen, diluting the contrast media further, and dehydrating the patient. Also, iodine has a faster transit time than barium so lateral and ventrodorsal projections should be made more frequently (usually every 10\u201330 minutes) until the contrast is seen in the large intestine (Owens, 1999).
