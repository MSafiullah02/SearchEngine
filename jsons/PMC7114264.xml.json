Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), elafin and WFDC1/ps20 are three members of this WAP family, characterized by the presence of a four-disulfide core (FDC) structure (Bingle and Vyakarnam, 2008, Bouchard et al., 2006, Hennighausen and Sippel, 1982a, Hennighausen and Sippel, 1982b, Piletz et al., 1981, Simpson et al., 2000, Simpson and Nicholas, 2002). SLPI and elafin exhibit antiviral activity that is not associated with their anti-protease function (Bingle and Vyakarnam, 2008, Ma et al., 2004, McNeely et al., 1995): SLPI inhibits human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of primary monocytes by binding to annexin II (Bingle et al., 2001, Doumas et al., 2005, Ma et al., 2004) and elafin exerts its antiviral activity by direct binding to HIV (Ghosh et al., 2009). Unlike elafin and SLPI, ps20 is a permissivity factor for HIV infection (Alvarez et al., 2007).",

The interaction of CD54 with LFA-1 is known to stabilize HIV-1 fusion to targets cells, thereby promoting HIV entry.

            "text": "Mouse hepatitis virus type 1 (MHV-1) is a member of the Coronaviridae family of positive single-stranded RNA viruses. MHV-1 infects a wide variety of species, including humans, rodents, felines and birds (Gu and Korteweg, 2007, Spaan et al., 1988). MHV-1 is a mouse-specific coronavirus (Spaan et al., 1988). MHV strains enter host cells via endocytosis mediated by a virion spike protein binding to host carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1(CEACAM-1a) (Compton et al., 1992, Perlman and Netland, 2009). In an earlier report we described a mouse model of respiratory MHV-1 infection, wherein A/J mice are more susceptible to intranasal respiratory MHV-1 infection than C57Bl/6 mice, associated with differences in the host innate immune response, specifically the interferon (IFN) response (Albuquerque et al., 2006, Baig and Fish, 2008). Subsequent publications have confirmed that variable sensitivity to MHV-1 infection is a consequence of the innate and adaptive immune responses (Khanolkar et al., 2009a) and that MHV infection inhibits IFN production (Zhou and Perlman, 2007). Notably, MHV-1-specific T and B cell responses exert protective effects that minimize morbidity in C57Bl/6 mice (Khanolkar et al., 2009a). Given the contribution of innate and adaptive immune responses to morbidity in MHV-1 infection of C57Bl/6 mice and the accumulating data that WAP proteins influence susceptibility to infection, employing ps20+/+ and ps20\u2212/\u2212 C57Bl/6 mice we examined the effects of ps20 on the immune response to MHV-1 infection. Our data reveal a hitherto unreported contribution of neutrophils to MHV-1 infection and describe how ps20 expression affects both neutrophil migration to MHV-1 infected lungs and draining lymph nodes (dLNs) and neutrophil susceptibility to infection, associated with effects on lung virus replication.",

These mice were generated through replacement of exon 1 of the WFDC1 gene with a LacZ gene at the WFDC1 ATG start codon. The LacZ-PGK-neo cassette introduced an EcoRV site, which was used for screening by Southern analysis. To confirm deletion of WFDC1 and insertion of LacZ, genomic DNA was digested with EcoRV and probed with a Spe1-Apa 1.3 kb probe. The ps20\u2212/\u2212 allele is 6.5 kb, and the ps20+/+ allele is 9.5 kb. The screened ps20\u2212/\u2212 gene constructs were inserted into a 129 mouse blastocyte by electroporation and subsequently implanted into a C57Bl/6 ps20+/+ female host. Pups were subsequently backcrossed to a C57Bl/6 background using a speed congenic approach. Briefly, low-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis (The Center for Applied Genomics, Toronto, ON) was performed on tail-snip DNA from the pups of each progeny litter. Mice exhibiting the highest SNP homology to C57Bl/6 were selected for subsequent breeding. Screening was completed until mice were >98% homologous to C57Bl/6 mice. A/J and C57Bl/6 mice, aged 6\u20138 weeks were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were bred and housed in a pathogen-free environment and all experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Toronto General Research Institute.",

Notably, MHV-1 infection of both ps20+/+ and ps20\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts does not result in a cytopathic effect or induce apoptosis by 24 h post-infection, hence viral progeny were measured in culture medium following infection of cells, using the L2 plaque assay as described (Section 2.5). To confirm that this outcome was a direct consequence of ps20 expression levels, we next examined the effects of treatment of ps20+/+ fibroblasts with neutralizing antibodies to ps20, namely the anti-ps20 FAb IG7, on MHV-1 infection. Following a 1 h pre-treatment with IG7, ps20+/+ fibroblasts were infected with MHV-1 at an MOI of 0.01 for 16 h. ps20+/+ fibroblasts treated with IG7 exhibited higher viral titers compared with ps20+/+ fibroblasts treated with either a control FAb or PBS (PBS mock-treated control \u223c12.75 PFU/mL; control IgG \u223c16.7 PFU/mL; IG7 \u223c535.4 PFU/mL) (Fig. 2B).",

The induced gene expression levels of IFN-\u03b14 and ISG15 are greater in the ps20+/+ fibroblasts compared with the ps20\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts when infected with MHV-1 at an MOI of 0.1, although IFN-\u03b2 gene expression is induced to comparable levels (Fig. 3\nA). Next we examined the gene expression levels for CXCL1 and CXCL2, chemokines with neutrophil chemoattractant activity. CXCL1 and CXCL2 gene expression levels are detectable post-infection in both the ps20\u2212/\u2212 and ps20+/+ fibroblasts, with greater CXCL1 and CXCL2 gene expression in the ps20\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts (Fig. 3A). In a more extensive time course study we observe that following MHV-1 infection CXCL2 gene expression is downregulated in ps20+/+ fibroblasts (Fig. 3B). Notably, in the absence of ps20, basal levels of CXCL2 are higher in the ps20\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts and, following MHV-1 infection, although there is some downregulation in CXCL2 expression, by 24 h levels are elevated again and comparable to uninfected cells, in stark contrast to the ps20 sufficient fibroblasts (Fig. 3B).

Consistent with what we observed in vitro, ps20\u2212/\u2212 mice are more susceptible to MHV-1 infection than ps20+/+ mice (Fig. 4\nA). Differences in viral burden in the lungs are evident on days 1 and 2 post-infection (Day 1: ps20+/+\n \u223c 131.5 PFU/g; ps20\u2212/\u2212\n \u223c 2.14 \u00d7 104\n PFU/g; Day 2: ps20+/+\n \u223c 1.80 \u00d7 103\n PFU/g; ps20\u2212/\u2212\n \u223c 1.06 \u00d7 104\n PFU/g.).

Additionally, we observe an IFN response to MHV-1 infection in the lungs of infected mice, with no difference in IFN gene expression levels between ps20+/+ and ps20 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 4B). In the absence of experimental data that show the effects of different lung viral titers on IFN induction, we infer that the viral burden in the lungs of both ps20\u2212/\u2212 and ps20+/+ mice is such that IFN induction is comparable.

In dose\u2013response experiments we examined the ability of recombinant ps20 protein, when incubated with human neutrophil elastase, to affect the elastase cleavage of the substrate N-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val p-nitroanilide. Neutrophil elastase cleaves the substrate on the carboxyl side of valine and this cleavage results in the liberation of p-nitroanilide (Hagio et al., 2001, Simpson et al., 2001).

Neutrophils were isolated from the BM of ps20+/+ and ps20\u2212/\u2212mice and cell surface expression of CEACAM-1, the receptor for MHV-1, was determined by FACS. The data in Fig. 8\nA identify cell surface expression of CEACAM-1 in both ps20+/+ and ps20\u2212/\u2212 neutrophils, at comparable levels. The implications are that MHV-1 will infect neutrophils. Accordingly, we examined the infectivity of BM derived neutrophils from ps20+/+ and ps20\u2212/\u2212 mice and provide evidence that both are susceptible to MHV-1 infection, yet the absence of ps20 is associated with greater infectivity (Fig. 8B). Neutrophils are generally associated with clearance of infectious pathogens, mediated by their TLR activation and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (Clark et al., 2007, Gonzalez-Dosal et al., 2011). Notably, exposure of both ps20+/+ and ps20\u2212/\u2212 BM derived neutrophils to MHV-1 did not result in intracellular ROS generation and neutrophils from ps20\u2212/\u2212 mice have lower levels of intracellular ROS even in the absence of infection (Fig. 8C). Immunohistology of lungs from ps20+/+ and ps20\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with MHV-1 did not reveal NET formation at 48 h post-infection, despite evidence of extensive neutrophil lung infiltration (Fig. 9\n).",

Since neutrophil elastase activity facilitates the migration of neutrophils into inflamed tissue (Wang et al., 2005, Young et al., 2007), we speculated that ps20 may inhibit elastase activity, resembling elafin and SLPI, and that this inhibitory activity might decreased neutrophil migration into the lungs of ps20+/+ mice compared with ps20\u2212/\u2212 mice. However, in vitro examination of ps20 effects on neutrophil elastase activity revealed no inhibition. Close examination of the signature amino acid sequence conserved in SLPI and elafin that is thought to be associated with neutrophil elastase activity, reveals that it is not conserved in ps20 (Bingle and Vyakarnam, 2008). Accordingly, the difference observed in neutrophil migration between ps20+/+ and ps20\u2212/\u2212 mice during MHV-1 infection likely is not a consequence of ps20 effects on neutrophil elastase activity.",
