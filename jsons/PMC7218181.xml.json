Evidence of human-to-human transmission has been reported in both communities and hospitals1; COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease that can spread rapidly through respiratory droplets of infected individuals.2 According to one of the first published COVID-19 studies, the most common symptoms at onset are fever, cough, myalgia, and/or fatigue, and less common symptoms include sputum, headache, hemoptysis, and diarrhea.3 However, these symptoms may be more severe in the elderly, the immunosuppressed, and those with chronic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and pulmonary dysfunction.4,5\n",

On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 is a \u201cPublic Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)\u201d during its second meeting of the Emergency Committee.6 As of February 27, 2020, there were 1,610,909 accumulative confirmed cases and 99,690 cumulative deaths globally.7 Iranian health authorities confirmed the first COVID-19 cases on February 19, 2020, in Qom. As of February 27, 2020, there had been >66,220 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 4,110 deaths in Iran.8 Notably, however, Iran has had the highest improvement in COVID-19; it ranks second in the world after China. Recently, although the number of new cases reported in China has been steadily decreasing, epidemics in other countries are still a major concern. Prevention and identification of the disease have become the most important tasks in Iran, and the government has invested many material and human resources to manage the epidemic.9 Currently, no licensed preventative vaccine or specific antiviral therapy is available for COVID-19, and according to the basic theory of controlling infectious diseases, the most effective measures include eliminating the source of infection, disrupting transmission, and protecting susceptible individuals. Therefore, to cope with a sudden outbreak of COVID-19, the community needs to be screened, and whether the infection has occurred and the dynamics of when it is contagious need to be understood more fully.",

Those suspected of having the disease receive a message regarding their health status, and healthcare providers then call them and guide them. Also, the their residences are disinfected and other family members are quarantined if required. If they do not improve within 3 days, they are referred to the emergency department of a hospital.

During the pandemic, many efforts have been made to find effective and efficient solutions for the initial management of COVID-19 globally. One of the significant factors, which is been emphasized today, is the important role of community engagement in the management and screening of infected patients. People's attitudes toward the disease and understanding of its consequences if left untreated have played an important role in encouraging their participation in self-screening through designed website. The government has allocated >17,000 health houses and >9,000 comprehensive health centers in urban, suburban, and rural areas throughout the country to support the plan. These centers, as community health centers, play an important role in these efforts; they are responsible for delivering integrated care services to the population in geographically defined areas.11 In addition, this plan is consistent with the overall goal of developing health systems, strengthening their capacity to meet the needs of the community, and achieving universal health coverage.",

On the other hand, it prevents nonemergency referrals to emergency departments of hospitals. Implementing a simple strategy can be effective for the health system in dealing with this pandemic.
