The World Health\nOrganization named this new coronavirus disease COVID-19, resulting from the combination\nof the words Corona, Viruses and Disease, with an indication of the year 2019, the year\nof its appearance. The General Directorate of Health of Portugal states that the\ntransmission of COVID-19 can occur through respiratory droplets, direct contact with\nrespiratory secretions, infected feces or contaminated surfaces and by air, through\naerosol generators(\n1\n).",

            "text": "There are relatively few reported cases of COVID-19 infection in children, compared to\nthe total number of cases in the general population. In February 2020, 2.4% of the\n75,465 cases in China (confirmed and suspected) occurred in children, as well as in\nItaly with 1.2%(\n2\n) and 5% in the United States of America(\n3\n). Data from the General Directorate of Health of Portugal, from March 29,\n2020, show that 1% of children under 10 years old and 2.3% of adolescents between 11 and\n19 years old were presenting COVID-19. At the moment, there are no cases of death in\nthis age group(\n1\n). One of the explanations for this disease not being prevalent in children\nmay be because they are less exposed to the virus and have less indications for testing\nfor SARS CoV-2 because, in most cases, they have mild symptoms similar to those of a\ncommon flu. The function of innate immunity to respiratory tract infection is greater in\nchildren than in adults, because the adaptive immune response in children is superior\nand the protein that binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme is less mature in\nyounger people, which makes such binding difficult. Thus, children's ability to trigger\nan acute inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 is weak, which can also contribute to a\nbetter outcome. Such particularities, however, do not eliminate the possibility of\nserious cases and even death, especially in children with comorbidities(\n4\n).",
