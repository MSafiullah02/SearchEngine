This retrospectively diagnosed intensive care unit/critical care unit (ICU/CCU)-associated outbreak occurred in April 2012 in a large public hospital in Zarqa, Jordan, located 25 km northeast of the Jordanian capital of Amman [2] . The authors, using 3 antibody assays developed by the CDC, are the first to provide serologic data on this outbreak. These assays advance the ability to conduct wider population-based serosurveys for MERS as well as to assist in the diagnosis of individual patients.",

The MOH undertook at least 3 major epidemiologic investigations. The first in April 2012 stopped the outbreak of the unknown and likely contagious hospital-associated pneumonia that involved 13 persons, most of whom were healthcare personnel. Importantly, patient samples from at least 2 of the fatal cases were obtained and stored. The second major investigation was with the World Health Organization (WHO) in November-December 2012 after the laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of MERS had been made retrospectively on the stored specimens from the 2 fatal cases [2, 6, 7] . The third was in collaboration with the CDC in May 2013. This study added 7 survivors who, 13 months after the outbreak, had at least 2 serologically positive tests for anti-MERS-CoV antibodies [1] .",

The initial outbreak communication response by the Jordan MOH occurred on 19 April 2012 when they closed the ICU at Zarqa Public Hospital and notified the press that 1 healthcare worker had died due to this outbreak of \"pneumonia.\" On 20 April the Jordan Times published the first of a series of articles on the outbreak [8] . Notably, the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) published an epidemiological summary and assessment in its 29 April 2012-5 May 2012 Communicable Disease Threats Report. ECDC noted that 1 nurse had died and that at least 7 nurses and 1 doctor had a febrile lower respiratory illness. Citing the Jordan MOH, it was reported that the cause was likely to be viral; however, no laboratory tests were available. ECDC stated that due to the severity and \"unusualness\" of the illness in healthcare personnel, they contacted WHO and the CDC and that both organizations also \"are following this event\" [9] . Meanwhile, the outbreak was stopped, in part, by creating a case definition that focused on unexplained pneumonia and transferring suspected patients to 2 hospitals in Amman where strict infection control measures were undertaken (unlike in the ICU/CCU at Zarqa Hospital). The onset of illness for the last patient was on 26 April [2] .",

This report first appeared on 20 September 2012 on the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED) website. It was posted by the astute microbiologist, Dr Ali Zaki, who reported that this virus grew easily on Vero cells [11] . Testing with a pan-CoV reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was consistent with a CoV and with molecular identification in the Erasmus Medical Center, Netherlands, which showed that it was a novel beta CoV [10, 11] . Later studies from the University of Hong Kong also showed that the virus could grow on a broad range of cell lines [12] . On 25 September 2012 ProMED posted an inquiry from Dr Iren Lai from Sydney, Australia, asking if this novel CoV could be the cause of the outbreak in Zarqa, Jordan [13] .",

Notable findings included that the index case \"could not be determined\" and \"there was no history of travel or contact with animals among confirmed or probable cases\" [7] .

A possible explanation is the fact that he was still viremic before he died. A small number of other patients with MERS have been found to be viremic as well, thereby raising the concern of a risk to the blood supply or of maternal-fetal transmission of MERS-CoV. In fact, 1 of the serologically positive cases in this study, household contact \"HHM-303,\" was a 39-year-old woman who had a stillbirth at 5 months gestation during the time she had an acute respiratory illness. She had been exposed to 2 family members who would later be diagnosed with MERS within 7 days of the onset of her illness and spontaneous delivery of a stillborn infant.",

Obtaining and preserving patient specimens as comprehensively as possible would be an essential start. The specific types of laboratory assays, ranging from contemporary molecular to traditional culture techniques, and electron microscopy would likely be included. Acute and convalescent serum for serologic tests and for assessing the pathogen in blood would be important. Where possible, preservation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells could also be helpful when testing for a reservoir for the pathogen and cellmediated immune responses.",
