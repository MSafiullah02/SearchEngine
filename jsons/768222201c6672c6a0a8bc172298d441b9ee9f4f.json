People engaged in 8 hunting and management of such wild animals are at high risk of infection, likely live in mountain or rural areas and are more likely to be undetected when having such an infection for various reasons.ConclusionsOur study suggests that there are at least two different viral strains of 2019-nCoV infecting human and human infection occurred a few months earlier than the outbreak being officially announced. Recessive infection and underdetection can cause a delay in response. The seafood market in Wuhan may or may not be the first spot of this outbreak.A large number of viruses carried by wild animals bring many uncertainties to the emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). In order to effectively control these EIDs, it is necessary to strengthen interdisciplinary cooperation and communication among human, animal and environmental health investigators based on the One Health concept, so as to detect and identify pathogens as early as possible, find patients and report epidemics, and effectively control the spread of EIDs through timely isolation and prevention measures and observation of close contacts.ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATEThis study is a serial of phylogenetic analyses based on large scale of existing gene sequences; all these sequences can be searched and downloaded from two public databases, the NCBI Influenza Virus Sequence Database and the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database.
