            "text": "Dobutamine has been widely advocated to improve (inadequate) cardiac output in septic shock. However, on the basis of the double-blind, crossover, randomized study from Hernandez et al. [1], the microcirculatory and regional effects, despite improvement of the macrocirculation, seem to be limited. Indeed despite an increase in cardiac output and heart rate, with dobutamine, they found no significant impact on lactate level and sublingual vessel perfused density. This is in contrast to some other studies. The question now is were the results of these earlier studies wrong or is the current baseline resuscitation of critically ill patients so different from these earlier days that the state of the vasculature of our patients is now different when compared to those earlier days?",

Maybe even the resuscitation measures used, in and of itself, influence endothelial activation/injury. Targeting these sepsis-induced coagulation abnormalities that are critically linked to endothelial injury was reviewed by Levi and van der Poll [4]. The impressive effect of recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin on disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and prognosis in a pilot uncontrolled study published in the journal this year merits further investigations in patients with severe sepsis [5]. Another question arises from this study: what is a clinically relevant endpoint of resuscitation? We more or less agree that macrocirculatory endpoints might not be adequate in many cases. At least in fluid resuscitation patients the microcirculation might prove to be more important than macrocirculation [6]. Adequate microcirculatory perfusion might even permit one to have abnormal macrocirculatory parameters; however, the scientific bases for these endpoints need to be laid out [7].",

Kurniati et al. [8] demonstrated that the endothelial expression of Tie2 in vivo is dependent on flow. A decrease of flow leads to a decrease in Tie2 expression. This has major implications for basal research on sepsis mediators and its effects on endothelial cells. The translation from these preclinical findings to human sepsis is more complicated, but the study suggests that interventions in sepsis patients aimed at normalizing diminished blood flow may be able to prevent downregulation of Tie2 and potentially counteract microvascular dysfunction and permeability in this devastating condition.",

All three trials conform to CONSORT guidelines, address the same fundamental questions, and share key design elements. Each trial is a patient-level, equal-randomized, parallel-group superiority trial that seeks to enroll emergency department patients with inclusion criteria that are consistent with the original EGDT trial (suspected or confirmed infection, two or more systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria, and refractory hypotension or elevated lactate), is powered to detect a 6\u20138 % absolute mortality reduction (hospital or 90-day), and uses trained teams to deliver EGDT.

A better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms induced after severe injury is a prerequisite to the initiation of immune adjuvant therapies. MerTK is a protein tyrosine kinase that with Tyro-3 and Axl comprises the TAM receptor family. In their very interesting and elegant study, Guignant et al. [10] prospectively evaluated 98 patients with septic shock and severe trauma to investigate the expression patterns of TAM receptors in circulating white blood cells. They observed that the evolution of MerTK expression in circulating monocytes over time is associated with adverse outcome in patients with septic shock. MerTK expression decreased between day 1/2 after the onset of injury and day 3/4 in patients with septic shock who recovered uneventfully, but remained elevated in patients who died or developed a nosocomial episode. Patients with persistent overexpression in whom MerTK expression remained elevated at day 3/4 may actually be at risk of deleterious outcome. These observations suggest that the development of a putative biomarker evaluating the risk of death or infection after severe injury may require dynamic measurements over time to be more informative than a single value, and the evolution of monocyte MerTK overexpression in patients with septic shock over time may be predictive of adverse outcome.",

They found considerable differences in vancomycin concentrations among the three SIRS subgroups. Consistent with these concentration measurements, the area under the curve/minimum inhibitory concentration ratio (AUC/MIC) of vancomycin showed a decreasing trend with increasing SIRS score. The AUC/MIC is the most important pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameter correlating with efficacy and the target AUC/MIC has been reported to be more than 400. In this study, 39 % of patients with SIRS-2, 60 % of those with SIRS-3, and 69 % of those with SIRS-4 did not reach the target AUC/MIC of 400. This study clearly demonstrated changes in the pharmacokinetic profile of vancomycin in patients assessed using the SIRS criteria for the first time in a Japanese population.

It is one of the most frequent, lethal, and costly complications of central venous catheterization. It is also the most common cause of nosocomial bacteremia. Although the use of central venous catheters (CVC) is increasing, there is evidence that the problem of CRBSI can be reduced. In their distinguished and complex study Harron et al. [16] studied all the cases of BSI in two English children\u2019s hospitals in the period 2003\u20132010. They calculated trends of pediatric ICU (PICU)-acquired BSI, defined as BSI occurring between at least 2 days after admission until up to 2 days following discharge. In one PICU, they compared rates of all PICU-acquired BSI with clinically significant PICU-acquired BSI submitted to the national surveillance system. The results showed that the rate of PICU-acquired BSI per 1,000 bed-days was 15.17 (14.45\u201315.86). The rate of PICU-acquired BSI decreased by 9 % (95 % CI 7\u201311 %) each year during the study period. This corresponded to a 44 % reduction in the rate of PICU-acquired BSI between 2003 and 2010 associated with the introduction of a bundle of catheter care and maintenance. However, only 321 (41 %) BSIs were classified as clinically significant. Indeed, of the 445 PICU-acquired BSIs due to skin organisms (mainly coagulase negative staphylococci), only 155 (34.5 %) were clinically significant. Although definitions for classification of healthcare-associated BSI exist, there are no clear criteria to guide clinical judgment on classification of clinically significant positive isolates that are reported to the national surveillance system. Clinicians need to make daily judgments about the care and treatment of patients, but national monitoring requires objective outcome measures to achieve fair comparisons. Automated downloads of laboratory data to the voluntary surveillance system, introduced in recent years, offer the opportunity to capture all positive BSI data. Analyses based on these data would overestimate the total burden of clinically significant BSI acquired in the PICU, as happened in the described study.",

Colistin has been widely used for selective digestive decontamination (SDD) and selective oropharyngeal decontamination (SOD); however, the effects of this topical use on colistin resistance have not been determined rigorously, although some data suggest that prolonged use induces colistin resistance. Oostdijk et al. [24] tried to quantify the rates of colistin resistance among GNB in the intestinal and respiratory tract of patients receiving SDD or SOD in two large Dutch cohorts of ICU patients. The authors demonstrated that the prolonged use of colistin as part of SDD and SOD was not associated with increased acquisition of colistin-resistant GNB in the respiratory tract. Moreover, acquisition rates of colistin-resistant GNB in the intestinal tract during SDD ranged from 1.2 to 3.2 per 1,000 patient-days at risk. The overall conversion rate from colistin susceptibility to resistance in the intestinal tract was below 1 conversion per 1,000 patient-days at risk. Although the overall risk of acquisition of colistin-resistant GNB and conversion rates to colistin resistance were low the study identified the circumstances in which this risk is higher. The conversion rate was about fivefold higher during persistent intestinal carriage with GNB, and about 15-fold higher during intestinal colonization with tobramycin-resistant GNB. On the basis of the results of this study and the worrisome result of another study [25], the authors recommend SDD or SOD in settings with low levels of antibiotic resistance. If SDD or SOD is used, it should be accompanied by careful monitoring of tobramycin and colistin resistance in GNB.",

Using Markov chain modeling, they observed clear differences in the predominant acquisition routes between MRSA and gram-negative microorganisms. The conclusions of this study were that combination of simple infection control measures and antibiotic mixing was highly effective in reducing the prevalence of MRSA, but not of gram-negative microorganisms and are in line with the recently published study of the MOSAR group [27] and may suggest other interventions to reduce the spread of multiresistant gram-negative bacteria in the ICU.",

Of these patients, 152 (31 %) were allocated to group 1 with early-onset pneumonia and no risk factors for PRM acquisition, and 333 (69 %) were allocated to group 2 with early-onset pneumonia with risk factors for PRM or late onset pneumonia. Group 2 patients were older and had more chronic renal failure and more severe illness (SAPS II score, 44.6 \u00b1 16.5 vs. 47.4 \u00b1 17.8, p = 0.04) than group 1 patients. In group 1, 77 patients (51 %) had PRM in spite of the absence of classic risk factors recognized by the current guidelines. A logistic regression analysis identified that presence of severe sepsis/septic shock (OR = 3.79) and pneumonia developed in centers with greater than 25 % prevalence of PRM (OR = 11.3 were independently associated with multidrug resistance in group 1 patients. In patients admitted to ICUs with a prevalence of multidrug resistance greater than 25 % or with severe sepsis/septic shock, empiric therapy for group 1 nosocomial pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation should also include agents likely to be effective for multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. These factors should be taken into account when updating VAP/HAP guidelines.",

Typically, it causes VAP in patients with late-onset pneumonia or with risk factors such as previous administration of antibiotics. The increasing rate of MDR Pseudomonas is a concern and a challenge for clinicians. The presence of MDR is a clear factor for a higher initial inadequate treatment and higher mortality. Tumbarello and colleagues [33] conducted a retrospective analysis of prospective data collected in an ICU of a tertiary hospital in Italy. They included 110 VAP patients with confirmed P. aeruginosa. In 42 % of cases, the Pseudomonas was MDR. Sixty percent of the patients received initial inadequate therapy and 49 (44.5 %) died. Initial inadequate therapy, diabetes mellitus, higher SAPS II score, and older age were independently associated with ICU mortality. Among patients that survive, those with MDR Pseudomonas and those with initial inadequate therapy had significant longer periods of post-pneumonia onset mechanical ventilation days. These findings highlight the importance of initial adequacy of antibiotic treatment and that of the early detection of MDR Pseudomonas.\n",

Bouza and colleagues [36] performed an open-label randomized trial comparing linezolid and meropenem, and the control group, which received the standard of care. The main outcome was the development of VAP or VAT. Overall, of the 78 patients included in the study, 40 were in the intervention group and 38 in the control group. Both groups were comparable. Data for the intervention and control groups, respectively, were as follows: VAP + VAT/1,000 days was 31.79 vs. 64.78 (p = 0.03), median length of MV before the first episode of VAP or VAT 9 vs. 4.5 days (p = 0.02). No significant differences were observed in median length of stay in the ICU, median length of hospital stay, antibiotic use, Clostridium difficile infection, and overall mortality rate. They detected linezolid-resistant coagulase-negative and coagulase-positive staphylococci in the MHS ICU after the study period. This study suggested that a pre-emptive approach with broad-spectrum antibiotics may be effective in reducing the incidence and delaying the onset of VAP + VAT after MHS.

Of the respondents, who represented 611 departments in 70 countries, 99 % reported using aerosol therapy during mechanical ventilation (including noninvasive), 43 % exclusively used nebulizers and 55 % also used metered dose inhalers.

A total of 423 small molecules were identified; of these, the relative levels of 70 (17 %) were different between survivors and non-survivors (p \u2264 0.05). Broad differences were present in pathways of oxidative stress, bile acid metabolism, and stress response. Metabolite-based prognostic models for 90-day survival performed modestly (AUC = 0.67).

They are preferred to quinolones because some observational studies have shown a decreased mortality when comparing the two types of combination in favor of macrolides. It has been hypothesized that this beneficial effect is due to the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of macrolides. However, the potential effects in pure viral pneumonia are unknown. Martin-Loeches et al. [40] investigated the potential effects of macrolides in patients with severe pure H1N1 pneumonia. Primary viral pneumonia was present in 733 ICU patients with pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus infection with severe respiratory failure. Macrolide-based treatment was administered to 190 (26 %) patients. Patients who received macrolides more often had chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. Length of ICU stay in survivors was not significantly different in patients who received macrolides compared to patients who did not [10 (IQR 4\u201320) vs. 10 (IQR 5\u201320), p = 0.9]. ICU mortality was 24.1 % (n = 177). Patients with macrolide-based treatment had lower ICU mortality in the univariate analysis (19.2 vs. 28.1 %, p = 0.02); however, a propensity score analysis showed no effect of macrolide-based treatment on ICU mortality (OR = 0.87). A separate analysis of patients under mechanical ventilation yielded similar results (OR = 0.77; 95 % CI 0.44\u20131.35, p = 0.4).

The main endpoint was intubation rate. The secondary endpoint was rate of increased ventilatory support defined as an increase in oxygen requirement [50 %, the need to start noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or increase NIPPV support. Within 24 h, an increase in ventilatory support was required following 59 bronchoscopies (35 %), of which 25 (15 %) led to endotracheal intubation.

None of the baseline physiological parameters, including the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, was associated with intubation. Bronchoscopy is often followed by an increase in ventilatory support in hypoxemic critically ill patients, but less frequently by the need for intubation. COPD and immunosuppression is associated with the need for invasive ventilation in the 24 h following bronchoscopy.

Patients were monitored for cardiorespiratory complications. The treatment group underwent four blood draws to assess pharmacokinetic parameters. Nineteen patients were in the treatment group and 38 patients in the control group after consideration of exclusion criteria and consenting were included. No clinically significant differences were found between groups. There were no interventions or discontinuations of MgSO4 due to adverse events. In the treatment group, three patients had mild infusion-related reactions. Heart rate and respiratory rate were statistically significantly lower in the magnesium treatment group. The continuous infusions of MgSO4 were safe at the studied doses and maintained serum magnesium (SrMg) and ionized magnesium levels similar to levels required to produce smooth muscle relaxation in other clinical settings. Further studies are needed to investigate the efficacy of high-dose continuous MgSO4 infusion as an adjunctive treatment for severe asthma treatment and determine the SrMg level required to maintain airway smooth muscle relaxation.",

They demonstrated distinct profiles of early cytokine responses in gram-negative sepsis (threefold IL-6 levels, tenfold IL-10 levels, and double TNF levels) in contrast to gram-positive sepsis. The clinical utility of this observation is limited but the implications for different responses to attempts at immunomodulation or risk stratification are clear [71].",
