            "text": "An RNA molecule is a linear polymer in the nucleotides Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, Uracil. RNA molecules play various vital roles in the cell ranging from working as messengers mediating between genes and the protein that the genes encode (coding RNA) to functioning as enzymes (non-coding RNA) [1, 2]. Moreover many of the common viruses such as SARS, Zika, Ebola and HIV are self replicating RNA molecules that evolve rapidly [3]. The nucleotide bases of an RNA molecule can form hydrogen bonds with each other. These bonds give the molecule a 3-dimensional folded structure which is believed to determine the function of non-coding RNAs [4]. Since RNA embodies both genetic code as well as biological function, it can be thought of as incorporating both a genotype (RNA sequence) and a phenotype (RNA structure). This way, RNA serves as a microcosm for studying the properties of evolution in general and of RNA viruses in particular. For example the study of RNA virus adaptation from host to host is under heavy investigation [5\u20137].",

For a sequence \u03c3 the structure with minimum free energy (MFE) is proposed as the structure to which \u03c3 folds. There are efficient dynamical programming algorithms and software for computing the MFE structure (as well as the suboptimal structures and their energies) from the primary sequence. These include the Vienna RNA package [9] which we used for our computations in this paper.",

It exhibits a high degree of redundancy meaning that for each structure (satisfying a few conditions such as lack of isolates base pairs) there are many different sequences folding into it. Two RNA sequences are said to be neutral if they fold to the same structure. In general about 30% of one point mutants of an RNA sequence of length 100 are neutral. The set of all sequences folding to a structure S is called the neutral network of S. Neutral networks of different structures vary greatly in their sizes with some structures (usually natural structures) dominating vast portions of sequence space [10].

According to this theory, evolution is driven by neutral mutations and it is the accumulation of such mutations which results in the occurrence of beneficial mutations. This is in contrast with the selectionist view of evolution in which most mutations are either deleterious of beneficial. Neutral networks imply robustness for RNA phenotypes under mutations while at the same time increasing the number of other phenotypes to which one can evolve. Mutational robustness means that, due to the significant number of neutral neighbors for most sequences, RNA phenotypes are resilient under mutations of their underlying phenotypes. Therefore starting from a sequence in a neutral network and randomly mutating it, its structure stays the same for a period of time, as long as the mutations are neutral.",

In other words there are many different phenotypes to which a given one can evolve. However, as mentioned before, different RNA shapes differ in the size and shape of their neutral networks. To quantify these phenomena one defines the mutational robustness of a sequence to be the fraction of its one point mutants that fold into the same structure. Sequences of high robustness lie in the \u201cinterior\u201d of a neutral network while those of low neutrality lie closer to its interface with other networks.

He termed such a distribution a quasispecies. Around the same time as the publication of the quasispecies theory, Gillespie [18] proposed an algorithm for the probabilistic simulation of the interactions between molecular species in a flow reactor. Even though the physics behind molecular interactions in chemistry and mutations and natural selection in biology may be very different, Gillespie\u2019s approach can be applied to studying both [19]. Gillespie\u2019s method was adopted by Fontana and Schuster [19] for simulating RNA evolution. Such a simulation starts with a population of RNA sequences that are chosen at random. At each step a member of the population is chosen randomly to replicate. As in actual replication in cells there is a probability, called the error rate that a base is changed (mutated) during replication, resulting in a mutant copy of the original sequence. One uses a fitness function to decide which members are given more chance to replicate. Fontana and Schuster use three different fitness functions: the structure distance to a given natural structure [20], minimum free energy and a sigmoid function derived from the number of helices and the number of their arcs in the structure [19].",

Structural promiscuity is a closely related phenomenon in which a genotype, such as an enzyme, exhibits more than one function.

There is also a qualitative description of assimilation using dynamical (\u201clayered\u201d) genotype networks [27, 28]. Here, inspired by the Boltzmann ensemble of RNA (discussed below), we give a probabilistic interpretation of assimilation and then specialize it to RNA molecules. We postulate that all the phenotypes that a genotype can possibly have via either structural promiscuity or phenotypic plasticity belong to the abstract phenotype space of that genotype. For a fixed environmental condition, each element of the phenotype space has a specific probability of occurrence, with the most fit (wild type) being the most probable. However changes in the environment alter these probabilities. Such changes can either keep the wild type fixed (neutrality) or cause it to be replaced with another phenotype. However even in the former case, the probabilities of suboptimal (promiscuous) phenotypes can change. Note that the idea of a probabilistic phenotype space is somewhat similar to phenotype-genotype correlation analysis in medicine, see e.g. [29].",

The Boltzmann ensemble of a sequence contains all the secondary structures compatible with it, each with a given probability given by a Boltzmann probability distribution [31]. These probabilities reflect the amount of time the molecule spends in a given folded configuration. This is in contrast with the (still prevalent) point of view that an RNA molecule has a single folded structure. The probability of a given structure is in reverse proportion with its folding (free) energy and so the structure with the minimum free energy (MFE) is the most probable one. Therefore it is often regarded as the structure to which the molecule folds. However, oftentimes the MFE structure is just slightly more probable than the structure(s) with the second highest probability. The dependence of the phenotype probabilities on the environment is reflected in the dependence of Boltzmann probabilities on temperature [32]. A special case of this phenomenon is RNA thermometers whose structures change as a response to changes in temperature [33].",

Examples of (nearly) degenerate RNAs include: Riboswitches, Leptomonas collosoma spliced leader RNA [36] and the untranslated leader RNA of HIV-1 virus [37]. See also Fig. 3. Degenerate sequences have high evolvability and tend to cluster together in the sequence space, see Figs. 4 and 5. As illustrated in Fig. 6, the percentage of sequences which are degenerate increases as a function of the length of the chain so that for length 1000 and longer almost all sequences are degenerate. Degenerate RNA sequences were computationally studied in [38]. In [38] we also studied quasineutrality which is intimately related to our interpretation of genetic assimilation in the case of RNA. Two sequences are quasineutral if they have a phenotype (MFE structure) in common and similarly a mutation relating two such sequences is called a quasineutral mutation. Such a mutation is nontrivial (non-neutral) only if one of the two sequences is degenerate. In [38] we observed that quasineutral walks i.e. walks in the sequence space in which each new sequence is a quasineutral mutant of the last, resemble neutral walks in the short run and random walks in the long run. Such walks were able to reach their targets solely by means of genetic assimilation (see also the \u201cResults\u201d section on quasineutral simulations). This result provides computational evidence for the genetic assimilation theory in the context of RNA evolution.\n\n\n\n",

The structure of the 5\u2019 end of this mRNA, of length 58, is important in the regulation of translation of the associated gene [39]. In [39, 40] it is demonstrated that this mRNA posesses two different conformations (structures) referred to as A and B, see Fig. 3. When the environment temperature is increased the ratio of the two structures is shifted towards A. The authers analyse the one point mutants of this mRNA and realize that in mutants which resulted in overexpression, structure B predominates, whereas in most of the low-expression mutants, A is favored. This is because in structure B, the Shine-Dalgarno-AUG region is unpaired and, hence, more accessible for ribosome binding, whereas it is occluded in structure A. Some of these mutants have the same MFE-structure as the natural sequence and so can be regarded as being quasineutral to it.",

For RNA this has been further verified experimentally [42] and computationally [43]. (The result of [42] pertains to cryptic genetic variation however in the light of [43] it can be interpreted in terms of plasticity.) However in [15] Ancel and Fontana use simulations utilizing a fitness function obtained by averaging the fitnesses of suboptimal structures in a truncated Boltzmann ensemble to study the effect of plasticity on RNA evolution. They conclude that such a \u201cplastic fitness function\u201d results in the vanishing of plasticity in the population and prevents it from reaching its target.

We however note that this surge is not observed in the \u201cnon-adaptive\u201d simulations i.e. the ones in which all sequences have the same fitness and therefore there is no selective pressure.

We moreover observed that in the absence of the selective pressure, the pool of the dominant structure is much larger in quasineutral simulations. Some insight is provided by comparing the probability distributions \u03c1 and \u03c1\u2217 (see Methods\u201d section) for structures to which the inverse folds of Phenylalanine are likely to mutate, see Fig. 9. We can see that the initial part of the probability distribution for free mutants is much more flat compared to the distribution for quasineutral mutations. In other words in the quasineutral case there are a few select structures that dominate the distribution. This results in a much lower rate of shape innovation.\n",

To demonstrate this, we ran simulations in which the base pair distance was used to measure the distance of structures to the target. The base pair distance between two structures S and S\u2032 is given by the number of base pairs present in S1 but not in S2 plus the number of ones present in S2 but not in S1. So one can expect that in a simulation using this metric, the series of dominant structures connecting the initial structure S0 to the target ST is given by removing the arcs that are in S0 and not in ST and adding the arcs that are in ST and not in S0. We observe that this is indeed the case and in 18.5% of the 103 free simulations using base pair distance, the average MFE of the population drops to zero, i.e. the open chain becomes dominant. However the quasineutral runs even with base pair distance avoided this phenomenon. This can be attributed to the fact that quasineutral mutations tend to maintain the number of base pairs, see Fig. 10. Quasineutral mutations thus preserve the integrity of the structures involved even when there is a strong pressure to reduce the number of base pairs.\n",

We observe that even though neutral mutations are excluded from the computation of both \u03c1 and \u03c1\u2032, quasineutral mutations have a much higher likelihood of preserving the number of arcs. The probability of a positive (resp. negative) change in the number of arcs for free mutations is 0.5 (resp. 0.35) and for quasineutral mutations it is 0.46 (resp. 0.28). This means that quasineutral mutations are slightly less likely to decrease the number of arcs. Bottom: The same probabilities for structures S with 4 or 5 arcs. We see that when the number of arcs is low, quasineutral simulations are less likely to decrease the number of arcs and so to result in the structure to mutate to an open chain",

This means that the higher up a structure is, the higher its free energy and therefore the lower its Boltzmann probability. Thus the lowest structure is the MFE structure of the sequence. The label NS denotes the neutral network of S. A nondegenerate RNA sequence (left) which has structure S at MFE level is forced by selective pressure to neutrally (cryptically) evolve into a degenerate sequence folding to two RNA structures S,S\u2032 (center). Further selection causes the sequence to enter the neutral network of S\u2032 and discard its original phenotype S. This way the acquired phenotypic character S\u2032 becomes inherent to the genotype",

The rank 1 structure, the structure into which Phenylalanine is most likely to mutate, either freely (black curve) or quasineutrally (blue curve) is the same for the two curves. However the probability to mutate quasineutrally to this structure, \u03c1\u2217, is 29 times higher than its free probability \u03c1.
