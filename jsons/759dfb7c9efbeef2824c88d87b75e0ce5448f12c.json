We identified and analysed the amino acid 17 mutations that gained prominence worldwide in the early months of the pandemic. 18 Eight mutations have been identified along the viral genome, mostly located in 19 conserved segments of the structural proteins and showing low variability among 20 coronavirus, which indicated that they might have a functional impact. At the moment 21 of writing this paper, these mutations present a varied success in the SARS-CoV-2 virus 22 population; ranging from a change in the spike protein that becomes absolutely 23 prevalent, two mutations in the nucleocapsid protein showing frequencies around 25%, 24 to a mutation in the matrix protein that nearly fades out after reaching a frequency of 25 20%. 26 ",

            "text": "The emergence of the novel Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- 29 CoV-2) and the subsequent pandemic has become a health problem unparalleled in the 30 last century. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be originated from an animal coronavirus that 31 successfully adapted to humans. The species of origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not been fully 32 identified, but the virus seems to be related to SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses found 33 in bats and other mammal species, although different from them (Chan et The SARS-CoV-2 genome size is around 30 kb with the typical gene structure known in 36 other betacoronaviruses: starting from the 5\u2032, more than two-thirds of the genome 37 comprises orf1ab encoding polyproteins (nsp1 to nsp15), while the last third consists of 38 genes encoding major structural proteins; including spike (S or ORF2), envelope (E or 39 ORF4), membrane (M or ORF5), and nucleocapsid (N or ORF9) proteins. Additionally, the 40 SARS-CoV-2 contains at least 6 minor structural proteins, encoded by ORF3a, ORF6, 41 ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, and ORF10 genes (Khailany et al. 2020) . 42 The first cases of the novel coronavirus associated disease (CoVID-19) have been traced 43 to the Chinese province of Hubei in early December 2019 44 (https://www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-china/en/). 45 Although the actual index case is not really known, the first sequence of the novel 46 coronavirus was produced within weeks from the emergence of the disease (Zhu et al. 47 2019). As of the moment of writing this paper, more than 16,000 sequences have been 48 produced in less than five months since the start of the pandemic. This is a unique 49 opportunity to gain insight on the evolution of a betacoronavirus in a completely na\u00efve 50 4 human population. In this context, viral variants efficiently transmitted will have less 51 influence of the selection exerted by the immune response, since most transmissions 52 will occur from individuals before the development of an efficient immune response to 53 na\u00efve recipients. 54 The aim of the present study was to determine the amino acid substitutions in viral 55 proteins that were widely present in available sequences of SARS-CoV-2, relating them 56 to the known chronology of the pandemic. Also, the mutations found were assessed in 57 order to try to understand its potential significance for viral fitness. week, they were also reported in other continents (Supplementary Table S1 ). 117 Interestingly, the only substitution that became fully predominant was Asp614Gly in the 118 spike protein (ORF2-S). Gly57His in ORF3a reached a frequency of 50% at the moment 119 7 of writing this paper. It is worth noting that when the sequences where analysed by 120 continents, all mutations were spread worldwide, except the 175Met in the ORF5-M, 121 that was absent in Africa (Supplementary Table S1 ). Fig. S4 ). These clades did correspond to the L and S types reported by 212 Tang et al. (2020). This mutation was predicted to be neutral. 213 Finally, the last change was found in the nsp6 protein, Leu37Phe, which significance was 214 unclear. This mutation was also predicted to be neutral. ",

From early to late phases of the SARS epidemic of 2003, 134 11 substitutions gained wide spread.

Modelling of the original 153 and mutant proteins using template 6vsb.1.A from SwissModel of the S protein of SARS-154 CoV-2 (Wrap et al. 2020) showed that by changing Asp614 by Gly614, the distance to 155 Thr859 and its side chain increased (from 2.7 to 6.2 \u00c5), creating a cavity and a more 156 relaxed structure (Fig. 3).

The pictures show amino acid residues on 20\u00c5 distance from Asp614 (known to be bound by Ubc9, a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme of the sumoylation 167 system, probably at the SR segment. Since lysines are targets for sumoylation, we next 168 checked whether this substitution could introduce a sumoylation motif. The prediction 169 using two different methods JASSA v4 (http://www.jassa.fr/index.php?m=jassa) and 170 GPS-SUMO (http://sumosp.biocuckoo.org/) was negative. Predicted phosphorylation 171 sites and enzymes (NetPhos 3.1.) were not significantly different between variants. The 172 observed mutations were predicted to be neutral by Provean. 173 In the matrix protein, the main change was the substitution of Thr175 by Met175. 174 Thr175 was predicted to form part of a motif known to interact with 14-3-3 proteins and 175 of a potential phosphorylation site (173-SRTLSYYKL-181) targeted by protein kinases A 176 (PKA) and C (PKC), ribosomal s6 kinase (RKS), and DNA-dependent protein kinases. The 177 substitution of the THR by a MET was predicted again to be a phosphorylation site (for 178 PKA, PKC and RKS). Provean predicted that the introduction of M175 was deleterious 179 (score -3.135). Since no reliable model was available, 3D structure could not be assessed. 180 Interestingly, the presence of a M175 in the M protein occurred together with the 181 203KR204 mutation in 98% of the cases (p<0.0001). The rapid decay of this mutation 182 (Fig. 1) would be consistent with a deleterious effect.183 3.3. Substitutions in the minor structural proteins 3a and 8, and the non-mutation. The presence of His in residue 57 would be expected to 189 result in an increased positive charge at that site. 190 The Gly251Val mutation occurred in a predicted serine-phosphorylation site 248-191 TID(G/V)SSGVV-256. The introduction of a Val reduced the prediction scores for the site 192 from a maximum >0.90 with Gly for phosphokinase B and ATM serine/threonine 193 phosphokinase to 0.73-0.82 for the same enzymes. It is worth to note that the amino 194 acid at this position was strongly correlated with the amino acid present in position 57 195 of the same protein. Thus, among the sequences harbouring His57 in ORF3a, 99.8% were 196 associated with Gly251 and only 0.2% with Val251. In contrast, for Gln57, 17% of the 197 sequences harboured Val251 (p<0.001). Similarly, His57 was only found in sequences 198 harbouring Arg203-Gly204 in the N protein, while Gln57 was found simultaneously with 199 Arg203-Gly204 (70% of the cases) or Lys203-Arg204 (30%) (p<0.001). Both mutations 200were predicted as deleterious (scores of -3.286 for His57 and -8.581 for Val251).201    The lack of a reliable model made impossible to make any prediction of the impact of 202 those mutations on the 3D structure or the interactions between residues. However, 203 the checking of the potential in the secondary structure of the protein revealed that 204 mutation Gln57His resulted in the elimination of a turn of the protein predicted to be in 205 Ser58. Similarly, mutation Gly251Val eliminated the turn at Gly251 but did not affect the 206 turn predicted for Ser253 (Supplementary Fig. S3).",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a worst-case scenario of the introduction of a new 217 agent that transmits easily in a completely na\u00efve population. In this context,218    transmission events occur in an uncommonly high scale, in a very short period of time219    and with little selective pressures from the immune system if compared to an endemic 220 situation. This scenario would permit the arising of a great diversity of viral variants of221    which the fitter could be expected to gain predominance.222    In the present study, we identified 8 early mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome that 223 gained prevalence over 10% at some point during the pandemic. This cut-off was 224 arbitrarily set to discriminate random mutations and errors in sequencing from changes 225 that might have a bigger impact. Certainly, this approach has the limitation of neglecting 226 some mutations with lesser prevalence that still can be biologically significant. worth noting that 7 out of 8 of the widely spread mutations occurred in residues 229 that were highly conserved in related coronaviruses of bats, pangolins, civets, or in SARS-230 13 CoV(Fig. 2). Conserved regions are usually assumed to be functionally relevant and thus, 231 mutations in them may have deleterious effects or can be hardly tolerated; if so, they 232 will be probably removed in the future. A mutation in a highly conserved region that 233 becomes widespread and persists can be thought as representative of a change that 234 increases viral fitness. In the present case, we found three different situations:235    mutations that expanded and rise to predominance, mutations that expanded to a 236 certain extent and fade out, and mutations that are apparently expanding but not yet 237 predominant. This pattern affecting conserved regions was also seen for SARS-CoV238 although the affected proteins were different. Interestingly, in SARS-CoV-2 most of the 239 mutations were in structural proteins, while in SARS-CoV were in non-structural ones, 240 suggesting that the adaption process from the original host species to human was 241 different in these two cases. When the spike protein was examined, this difference was 242 more obvious. Mutations in SARS-CoV occurred in positions conserved in the civet and 243 bat-related coronaviruses but different from those of pangolin and SARS-CoV-2. In 244 contrast, spike mutation in position 614 of SARS-CoV-2 affected a residue that was 245 conserved in betacoronaviruses of pangolins, civets, bats, and SARS-CoV. This would be 246 compatible with a scenario where those mutations affected the viral fitness for that 247 particular new host, namely humans. The scale of the viral replication in the scenario of 248 a pandemic would be unprecedented for those coronaviruses and will provide the 249 probability for such beneficial mutations to appear and expand. 250 The Asp614Gly mutation in S protein is an example of a mutation becoming fully 251 predominant. A previous report (Korber et al. 2020) already indicated its emergence. 252 Recently, Bhattacharyya et al. (2020) suggested that the predominance of this mutation 253 as the pandemic advanced and the low proportion in initial phases of it was related to agree with Korber et al. (2020) regarding the possibility that the Asp214Gly 259 mutation produced a laxer interaction between S1 and S2 spike domains that might 260 facilitate shedding of S1 from membrane-bound S2. In SARS-CoV, the segment of S 261 protein including residues 597-625 contains epitopes inducing both neutralizing 262 antibodies (positions 604-625 in SARS-CoV) and antibodies participating in an antibody-263 dependent enhancement (ADE) in animal models (residues 597-625) (Wang et al. 2016). 264 The mutation Asp614Gly would affect the epitope segment inducing ADE but not the 265 one inducing neutralizing antibodies. Although, it has been hypothesized that ADE may 266 have a role in CoVID-19 (Tetro 2020) this has not been demonstrated (Sharma 2020). 267 The effects of the mutation on the immune escape or the transmission potential cannot 268 be concluded at this moment. 269 Regarding the mutations found in the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, the first surprising 270 fact was to find two consecutive substitutions in the highly conserved serine-rich 271 segment of the LKR region of the protein. The LKR region is essential for conferring 272 flexibility to the protein as well as for cell signalling, binding to RNA and to M protein. It 273 also contains multiple phosphorylation sites in the SR segment that are thought to be 274 essential (Reviewed by McBride et al. 2014). Since the mutant nucleocapsid introduced 275 a Lys residue -a canonical target for sumoylation -and sumoylation occurs in this region 276 by analogy to SARS-CoV (Fan et al. 2006) we also tested it. the nucleocapsid protein with the M protein is thought to happen 280 between the SR-region and the C-terminal domain of M (Escors et al. 2001; Kuo and 281 Masters 2002). We found that the M175 phenotype of the M protein was almost 282 exclusively associated to the 203K-204R phenotype of the nucleocapsid protein. It is 283 tempting to hypothesize that the above-mentioned residues may be involved in such 284 interaction. Besides this, the introduction of an additional charge in the SR segment may 285 enhance interaction with RNA which core is negatively charged. 286 Changes in the ORF3a protein have been recently reported to define microclonal clades 287 of SARS-CoV2 (Issa et al. 2020). We have found that the introduction of Val251 was 288 apparently non compatible with His57. We determined that, probably, such mutations 289 affected the secondary structure by changing the number of turns. Considering that 290 both residues are out of the functional domains proposed by Issa et al. (2020), those 291 changes in the structure of the protein may modify interactions enough to be non-292 compatible. Interestingly, mutations in ORF3a protein and mutations in the 293 nucleocapsid protein were related. To our knowledge, these two proteins have not been 294 investigated for interactions; however, this finding suggests that might be an Leu84Ser was reported before (Tang et al. 2020). The authors suggested 297 that the Leu variant (called L) is more aggressive and spreads easier. The evolution of 298 the proportion of strains harbouring this mutation would not support the idea of a 299 higher transmissibility of the L variant since its frequency clearly declined. Certainly, the 300 16 introduction of such variant in different countries applying control measures earlier or 301 later could have had an impact on the spread of the variants as well. 302 Finally, the nsp6 mutation at position 37 is difficult to interpret. The nsp6 of 303 coronaviruses is part of the replication machinery of the virus and has been reported to 304 induce autophagosomes (Benvenuto et al. 2020). The same authors suggested that it 305 may lead to a lower stability of the protein structure. Lacking a verified model for the 306 protein it is difficult to assess whether this happens or not. Interestingly, the same 307 authors indicated that the distribution of the Leu phenotype was restricted to Asia while 308 the Phe was common in other parts of the world. According to our analysis, the Phe 309 phenotype has almost disappeared in current sequences. The discrepancy could be 310 originated in the fact that Benvenuto et al. (2020) analysed the 351 sequences available 311 in a past moment while in the present analysis thousands of sequences from all over the 312 world have been included. 313 In summary, the present is a comprehensive report of the amino acid mutations that 314 gained spread during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic up to now. Most of the substitutions 315 gaining wide diffusion occurred in conserved positions indicating that they probably had 316 a functional impact but, differently from SARS-CoV, they accumulated in structural 317 proteins",
