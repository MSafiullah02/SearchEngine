Individuals who receive medical care abroad are a vulnerable, sentinel population, who sample the local environment and can carry home unusual and resistant infections, documented in many reports. Medical tourists are at risk for hospital-associated and procedurerelated infections as well as for locally endemic infections. Patients may not volunteer details about care abroad, so clinicians must inquire about medical procedures abroad as well as recent travel. Special infection control measures may be warranted. Healthcare abroad is associated with diverse financial, legal, ethical, and health-related issues. We focus on problems the infectious disease clinician may encounter and provide a framework for evaluating returned medical tourists with suspected infections. A better system is needed to ensure broad access to high-quality health services, continuity of care, and surveillance for complications.",

In the past, this was primarily to access facilities or technologies unavailable at home. Now travel for medical treatment has expanded enormously and many travel from developed countries to low-or middle-income countries, often to avoid high costs or long delays. Travel to another country for medical treatment has been called \"medical tourism\" and \"cross-border healthcare\" [1, 2] . Globalization of medical care is a multi-billion-dollar phenomenon, associated with economic, cultural, ethical, legal, and health consequences. A growing literature describes its dimensions and complexities [3] [4] [5] [6] . This paper will focus on infectious disease implications.",

Patients often seek treatment in their World Health Organization (WHO) region of residence, but the diaspora population may combine medical treatment with family visits [8] . Seventy percent of patients going to Singapore and Malaysia are from countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations; those going to Cuba are mainly from the Caribbean and Central America, and those going to Jordan are mostly from Middle Eastern countries [8] . The main constraint on medical tourism is the challenge of insurance portability. High-quality medical professionals, often trained in the United States or United Kingdom, are found in many institutions treating medical tourists; US medical schools are increasingly cooperating with foreign institutions in educational efforts. Meanwhile, lower costs of services, including labor, provide developing countries a substantial cost advantage [8] .",

Common procedures include dental work; arthroplasty; cataract, bariatric, cosmetic, and cardiac surgery; reproductive care; and tissue and organ transplant. More than 40% of unrelated stem cell transplants worldwide involve donors from a different country [15] . Vast cost differences exist: a hip replacement may cost $7000-$12 000 (India) or $6500-$14 000 (Thailand) versus $43 000-100 000 (United States) [12] .

Although this paper focuses on individuals who travel to obtain healthcare, similar risks exist for travelers who require care during travel (inadvertent medical tourists) and persons visiting friends and relatives who undergo procedures while abroad (incidental medical tourist). A Boston-area survey found that about half of international travelers experienced health problems, 7% sought medical care, and 1% required hospitalization [17] .",

At least 45 cases of malaria have occurred in organ (36 renal) ; at least 14 (3 heart, 5 liver, 6 renal transplants) had evidence supporting donor-to-host transmission via the graft [29] . Strongyloides stercoralis, endemic in tropical and subtropical regions, has been transmitted from a donor with unrecognized infection to kidney and liver transplant recipients [30] . A systematic review of outcomes found inferior patient and graft survival after commercial transplants ( performed in South Asia, East Asia, and the Middle East) compared to results described in the United Network for Organ Sharing [26] . Commercial transplants had a higher incidence of infections including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis, and markedly increased incidence of postoperative surgical interventions [26] . Likewise, patients who had renal transplants overseas (n = 87, mostly in China) followed at Seoul National University Hospital, Korea (2000-2009), had higher risk of infections, acute rejection, and hospitalization than did patients with local donors (n = 577) [31] . A meta-analysis (39 centers globally) concluded that transplant tourists had lower 1-year graft and patient survival than domestic kidney transplant recipients and were more likely than domestic kidney transplant recipients to develop cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus, HIV, and wound infections [32] .",

This metallo\u03b2-lactamase was first characterized from an isolate in a Swedish patient (Indian origin) who had been hospitalized in India in late 2007 and early 2008 [52] . In Sweden, a multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae from his urine and an E. coli cultured from a fecal sample were both positive for what was subsequently designated NDM. These carbapenemases have been identified primarily in Enterobacteriaceae but can spread to multiple gram-negative bacterial species, including other pathogens (eg, Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella), and to commensals. Bacteria may carry NDM-1 along with other resistance determinants; they are typically pan-resistant. The genetic element encoding NDM-1 is carried on plasmids and occasionally on chromosomes [53] . A 2010 paper identified 37 NDM-1-producing isolates in the United Kingdom, a high proportion in travelers to India or Pakistan within the previous year (n = 17/37); 14 had antecedent hospital treatment abroad, including renal or bone marrow transplant and cosmetic surgery [46] . The earliest documented NDM-1-producing isolates were in India in 2006 [54] . NDM-1-producing isolates are widespread in clinical isolates in India and Pakistan (Varanasi 6.9%, Mumbai 8%, and Rawalpindi, 18.5%), [54] [55] [56] and were also found in environmental samples (eg, water samples, Delhi) [57] .

For medical tourists, a tracking system is needed as patients from one institution may return to many different countries and institutions, making it difficult to identify problems at a particular institution. Improved communication is essential to optimize continuity of care of medical tourists who may have follow-up on a different continent by a clinical team unaware of site(s) of medical and surgical care. Medical tourists may carry home unusually resistant microbial flora; patients hospitalized after return from medical care in high-risk destinations such as South Asia should be placed on contact isolation and cultured for resistant organisms. Decisions about empiric therapy and surgical prophylaxis should consider recent travel history and procedures abroad. Surveillance networks such as GeoSentinel (55 traveltropical medicine clinics on 6 continents) can be refined to capture data on antimicrobial resistance. The International Health Regulations 2005 contain criteria to determine whether an event may \"constitute a public health emergency of international concern\" [64]; thus, WHO can potentially champion coordinated global surveillance of antimicrobial resistance as well as international response [65] .",

            "text": "Travel abroad for healthcare will likely continue to increase, given the market forces. Knowledge of this trend is critical in incorporating a global perspective into clinical care. Patients may not freely volunteer information about medical care, so today's medical history must include explicit queries about travel and details of medical care or procedures carried out abroad. The differential diagnosis of illness after a procedure in another country is often broader than that in the United States. Infection control issues must be considered, as patients may be colonized or infected with multidrug-resistant bacteria. Complicating infections may appear early or late, with the latter more common in those who have received blood or blood products, tissue or organ transplants, and immunosuppressed hosts. Healthcare abroad is an integral part of the knowledge base required of infectious disease clinicians. More generally, a better system is needed to gather information on these global patients and the outcomes of their treatment. Infectious diseases associated with medical tourism have been recognized primarily through case reports or case series. Collection of data including demographics, procedures sought, and outcomes in a systematic and standardized fashion is needed to inform physicians caring for patients seeking medical care abroad or returning from their overseas medical treatments. Policy makers must consider economic, ethical, and legal aspects of medical tourism in trying to balance healthcare access and affordability.",
