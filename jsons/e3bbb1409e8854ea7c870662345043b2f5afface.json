            "text": "Extensive review of the literature produced 12 studies and 1 pertinent review article examining the effects of briefing and/or debriefing on the performance of healthcare professionals conducting resuscitation in real or simulated clinical environments. Briefings (conducted prior to an event) and debriefings (after an event) encompass encounters ranging from short, focused discussions to lengthy, detailed, interactive sessions involving audiovisual recordings of the event(s) of interest and other sources of objective feedback (as from the patients or patient simulators involved in clinical training). Briefings and debriefings are grounded in sound adult learning theory, supported by rational conjecture, and felt to be essential for achieving expert performance. Adult learning theory predicts that the majority of learning occurs not during an event but rather after an event when the learner has the opportunity to reflect on his/her performance (as during a facilitated debriefing). Briefings and debriefings have been used for decades in other domains where the risk to human life is high and are a core component of maintenance of certification/competency programs in those domains. While objective data exists in some of those domains to support the use of briefings and debriefings it is far from being definitive in nature or comprehensive across all domains. Despite the paucity of objective evidence the use of briefings and debriefings remains standard operating procedure in commercial aviation, aerospace, the military, etc. and no one working in those domains would consider conducting a prospective, randomized, controlled trial where subjects (and those for whose safety they bear responsibility) are randomized to the \"no briefing/debriefing\" group. So what can be said about the effectiveness of briefings and/or debriefings in healthcare where the emphasis is clearly on evidencebased practice and historically the gold standard of evidence has consisted of the prospective, randomized, controlled, sufficiently powered clinical trial where the outcomes focus on patients? In some ways this situation is similar to the debate that is currently taking place regarding the extent of evidence necessary to accept the results of quality assurance/improvement work. At one end of the spectrum are investigators who insist that quality initiatives must be subject to the same rigorous testing that precedes the introduction of new pharmacologic therapies and medical instrumentation in order to prove that they actually improve quality of care and ensure patient safety. Alternatively, others note that requiring randomized controlled trials to assess the safety of innovations with high face validity may unduly place humans at risk and therefore prove impossible to conduct. Thus we are left with a situation where the need for more definitive evidence, while desirable, is felt by at least some members of the healthcare education and training community to be neither necessary nor practical.",

            "text": "As an additional note, it should be stated that debriefings and feedback are actually two separate activities. A debriefings is, by definition, a series of questions asked about a prior sequence of events; thus the emphasis is on solicitation of information from those who were present during the events, requiring their active engagement. Feedback, on the other hand, refers to the provision of information to others about a prior event or series of events. Thus, conducting a debriefing is technically much different, for both the instructor and the learner(s), than simply providing feedback.",

            "text": "The use of briefings and debriefings is a relatively recent phenomenon in healthcare. Briefings and debriefings may be conducted in association with either simulated or real clinical events and the reasons they are utilized vary. Given their novelty in healthcare the literature has very few actual studies of their use and utility; the vast majority of the literature consists of discussions of the theoretical soundness of the techniques based on principles of adult learning and \"how to\" descriptions. Evidence from two prospective randomized controlled (LOE 1) studies (Salvodelli 2006, 279; Mayo 2004, 2422) and ten other studies (LOE 3 -5) of briefings and debriefings document improvement in the acquisition of the content knowledge, technical skills and/or behavioral skills required for effective and safe resuscitation. Salvodelli et al compared the effects of debriefing vs no debriefing on performance in a simulated crisis scenario and found that debriefing produced a statistically significant improvement in behavioral skills. Mayo et al examined the effect of simulation + debriefing vs clinical experience as a resident on emergency airway management and determined that simulation + debriefing resulted in statistically significant improvement in skill immediately and four weeks after the experience. Of the studies cited in this review only two of thirteen (Mayo 2004, 2422; Edelson 2008, 1063) included an analysis of performance while caring for real patients in the actual clinical domain. The other eleven studies (Blum 2005, 1375; DeVita 2005, 518; Wayne 2005, 202; Savoldelli 2006, 279; Clay 2007, 738; Dine 2008, 2817; Falcone 2008, 1065; Goffman 2008, 294; Ireland 2008, 328; Mikrogianakis 2008, 761; Salas 2008, 518) examined the performance of the healthcare professionals while working with simulated patients. A total of twelve of the thirteen studies indicated that briefings and/or debriefings resulted in improved human performance during simulated or real resuscitation activities; only a single study (Blum 2005, 1375) revealed equivocal results.",

Based on subjective survey data the authors indicate that debriefings after real-life emergencies are common in the United Kingdom and felt to be generally helpful. However it appears that in this context debriefings were most frequently focused on the psychological wellbeing of the healthcare professionals rather than their performance or patient outcome, limiting its relevance to the question at hand.

(2004). \"Achieving house staff competence in emergency airway management: results of a teaching program using a computerized patient simulator.\" Crit Care Med 32(12): 2422-7. Comment: LOE 1, Quality Fair, Supporting. This study shows that simulation and debriefing focused on airway management resulted in improved performance in intubation skill (in simulated patients) compared to clinical experience during residency and successful completion of an ACLS post-test.

Comment: LOE 4, Quality Fair, Supporting. Simulated emergencies followed by facilitated debriefings produced improvements in content knowledge and confidence. Perhaps most importantly it also increased self-awareness of areas of weakness; this is an important, yet often underappreciated, aspect of debriefing. Salas E, Klein C, et al.
