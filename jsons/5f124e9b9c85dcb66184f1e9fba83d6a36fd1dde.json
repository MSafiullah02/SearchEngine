These viruses have also contributed internal genes to H5N1, H5N6, H7N9, and H10N8 viruses, which have been isolated from humans with infections and are a substantial public health threat. To investigate the potential pathogenic mechanism of the H9N2 virus, we performed serial lung-to-lung passage of an avirulent H9N2 avian influenza virus (A/Chicken/Shandong/416/2016 [SD/416]) in mice to increase the pathogenicity of this virus. We generated a mouse-adapted (MA) virus that exhibited increased viral titers in the lungs, caused severe lung damage in mice, and induced body weight loss in mice; however, the avirulent parental virus did not cause any clinical symptoms in infected mice. Global gene expression analysis was performed and indicated that the transcriptional responses of these viruses were distinct. The lungs of mice infected with the MA virus exhibited the downregulation of genes related to innate immunity and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, which was not seen in infections with the avirulent parental virus. These data indicated that the MA virus might evade immune surveillance and changed its replication capacity to increase the viral replication level and pathogenicity. Our study demonstrates that host factors play an important role in the adaptive evolution of influenza virus in new hosts.",

The H1, H2, and H3 subtypes can be stably transmitted to humans and have caused several pandemics in human history [4] . In addition, influenza viruses, such as H5N1, H5N6, H7N9, and H9N2, have sporadically infected humans directly from terrestrial animals, suggesting that other influenza virus subtypes also pose a potential threat as the cause of new pandemics through further evolution [5] [6] [7] .",

In the laboratory, the serial passage of AIVs in mammalian hosts can result in adaptive viral changes. Currently, scientists have mainly studied the pathogenic mechanism of viral adaptability in regard to viral replication, transmission, and virulence. For example, Wang et al. reported that the combination of 147 L and 627 K in the PB2 protein was a major contributor to the adaptation and increased virulence of the H9N2 influenza virus in mice [16] . The PB1-K577E mutation is a marker of the mammalian adaptation of the H9N2 virus [17] . The NS1-T5S substitution has previously been observed in a mouse-adapted (MA) avian H9N2 subtype (A/Ck/Korea/163/04H9N2), implying that this mutation may be preferentially selected during the viral adaptation of avian influenza in mammals [18] . However, scientists rarely study the pathogenic mechanism of the interaction between an adapted virus and the new host.",

To evaluate gene expression changes in response to infection, we used a random variance model (RVM) to filter differentially expressed genes (DEGs), because the RVM t test performs much better than the standard t test when identifying significantly different genes between groups. To select for genes that were the most relevant to infection, a P value of < 0.05 was considered significantly different [19, 20] . The detailed information of DEGs is described in Supplementary table 1.",

To examine the biological functions of the DEGs, we used GO enrichment analysis to examine the genes of the SD/416 and MA-infected mouse lungs (Table 1 ). This analysis method enriched the key genes and the surrounding genes of related biological functions, and in this study, we only focused on the key genes. We found that the transcriptional activity of the innate immune response and proteolysis were altered (Tables S2 and S3 ). The key genes of the innate immune response were down-regulated by infections with the MA virus compared with the control (Table S2 ). In addition to GO enrichment analysis and pathway analysis, key DEGs were assembled into a functional pathway, generating a global view of the host-pathogen immune response to influenza virus infection (Fig. 5 ). Genes were color coded according to the signaling pathways and gene expression differences (Fig. 5) . Compared to the control group, the genes of MA-infected mouse lungs encoded three pattern-recognition receptors, including RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and NOD-like receptors (NLRs) ( Table S3) . We found changes in TLR3 and TLR7 that have been implicated in the defense against influenza virus infections [24, 25] . The expression levels of the TLR genes were reduced in response to the MA virus infection, suggesting that the MA virus inhibits TLR signaling through TLR3 and TLR7. The CYLD and TANK genes, which are RLR family members, were down-regulated in MA-infected mouse lungs but were not down-regulated in response to SD/416 infection (Fig. 5) . CYLD is a negative regulator of RIG-I-mediated innate antiviral responses [26] . TANK interacts with MAVS, TRIF, and TBK1 to regulate RLR-and TLR-mediated interferon production [27] . We also found that the NLR signaling group members CASP1 and CASP8 (Fig. 5) . To validate the results of the innate immune response in the lung, two genes (IRF5 and TLR2) that are down-regulated in both SD/416 and MA virus-infected mouse lungs were chosen for qRT-PCR analysis (Fig. S3a, b) . Overall, the MA virus inhibited TLR, RLR, and NLR signaling more than the SD/416 virus, which may be related to the greater pathogenicity of the MA virus.",

As mentioned above, MA viral infections alter the expression of proteolytic genes ( Table 1 ). The pathway analysis of the genes involved with proteolysis revealed that these genes were involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in MA virus-infected mice compared with the control (Table S2 ). This pathway was generally absent in SD/416-infected mice compared with the control (Table S3) . Eighteen genes were induced with the MA virus infection, and only two genes were induced with SD/416 infection. These 18 genes were members of E1 (SAE1 and UBA6), E2 (UBE2A, UBE2C, UBE2J1, and UBE2N), and E3 (WWP2, HERC4, RCHY1, FANCL, CUL2, TCEB2, BIRC3, RBX1, CDC16, CDC20, ANAPC4, and CDC27) (Fig. 6) . Further research on the biological functions of these genes showed that approximately one-third of the genes (RBX1, UBE2N, WWP2, RCHY1, UBE2J1, and HERC4) [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] play roles in antiviral innate immunity, while others (CDC16, SAE1 and CUL2) [34, 35] are related to viral replication. To validate the results of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in the lung, two genes (UBE2A and CDC20) that are down-regulated in both SD/416 and MA virus-infected mouse lungs were chosen for qRT-PCR analysis (Figs. S3C, D) . This suggests that the MA virus had a stronger replication ability and higher virulence, and these characteristics were related to the downregulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS).",

            "text": "Previous studies have investigated the pathogenesis of adapted viruses from the perspective of the virus itself, but have rarely studied the interaction between the adapted virus and the new host. In the current study, we acquired an adapted virus by performing five passages of a virus in mice. The viral titers in the MA virus-infected lungs were almost 1000-fold greater than those in the SD/416-infected lungs, and the MA virus could kill one in five infected mice (MLD 50 > 6.38 log EID 50 ). The transcriptome data indicated that the MA virus activated the innate immune response and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. The differences in the host transcriptional responses to infection mirrored the clinical manifestations of the disease, with a clear response profile distinguishing the MA virus from SD/416. This study described the pathogenesis of influenza virus resulting from the interaction between the adapted virus and the new host. H9N2 influenza virus is an avian virus with low pathogenicity, so mandatory immunization is not required. Because of this, the H9N2 virus is easily amplified and disseminated in nature, increasing the probability of transmission to other birds and humans. In China, H9N2 infections in humans were documented in 1999, 2003, and 2013 [9] . India, Cambodia, Romania, the United States, Nigeria, and Vietnam have reported that poultry workers were serologically positive for H9N2 [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] . In addition, H9N2 virus can act as a \"vehicle\" to deliver different subtypes of AIVs to humans. The internal genes of H5N1, H5N6, H7N9, and H10N8 viruses, which pose a substantial threat to public health, came from H9N2 viruses [10] [11] [12] [13] . The mechanisms through which the H9 avian influenza virus adapts to mammals and crosses the species barrier are a scientific problem that needs to be solved now. The \"serial passage of virus\" approach is an experimental method for adapting an AIV to mammals to make the virus pathogenic to mammals, which could simulate the phenomenon of viruses crossing the interspecies barrier in a natural environment [16] . Therefore, we chose a wild-type SD/416 virus that was avirulent in mice for our tests. Here, we gained a virulent H9N2 virus using the lung-to-lung passages in BALB/c mice, and the virulent virus acquired five amino acid alterations [PB2 (T129A/ E627K), NP (T62S), and NS1 (T5S/S42A)]. The PB2/ E627K substitution not only contributed to the increased virulence and transmission efficiency of viruses in mammals, but also affected virus escape [44, 45] . The NP protein plays an important role in both viral assembly and RNA synthesis, and the NP-T62S substitution located near the RNA-binding region which affected the formation of RNP [46] . The NS1 protein counteracts innate immune responses by several mechanisms. In this study, the amino acids residue S42A of the NS1 locates near the nuclear localization signals, and interacts with RIG-I, TRIM25 to affect the innate immune responses [47] . In addition, the NS1-T5S substitution was commonly appeared in the mouse-adapted virus [18] . This study indicated that H9N2 viruses can acquire pathogenicity under the appropriate circumstances and could pose a substantial public health threat.",

Microarray analysis revealed that the transcription of genes involved in the innate immune response was inhibited. This inhibition included the suppression of TLR, RLR, and NLR signaling in response to infection with the MA virus. This may be related to the adapted virus evading immune surveillance. Previous reports have demonstrated that the NS1 protein is a very potent inhibitor of immunity that allows influenza virus to efficiently escape immune surveillance and to establish an infection in the host [50] . Furthermore, the NS1 protein that contains S42A mutation can interact with RIG-I, TRIM25 to affect the innate immune responses [47] . The PB2 E627K mutation permits escape from a species-specific restriction factor that targets viral polymerases [44] . In addition, antigenic drift in NP enabled viral escape from recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes [51] . The results of our analysis suggest that adapted viruses evade immune surveillance by adaptive mutations.",

In this study, some of the identified genes act as activators that regulate antiviral innate immunity. The downregulation of the expression of these genes can help viruses to escape immune surveillance. For instance, UBE2N as an activator that is essential for RIG-I-mediated MAVS aggregation in antiviral innate immunity [32] . In coronaviruses, RCHY1 interacts with the SARS unique domain to trigger the degradation of p53 and alters antiviral innate immunity [30] . The genes involved with ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis are involved in viral replication. CDC16 is an RAB1 GTPase-activating protein that mediates viral replication. SAE1 enzymes activate E1 by sumoylation and can restrict intracellular viral movement [35] . Perhaps, the ability of adapted viruses to replicate more is associated with the downregulation of these genes.",

Importantly, if a novel virus is generated via adaptation from birds to humans, this virus may be virulent in mammal. Further study is needed on the mechanism by which the adapted virus escapes immune surveillance and gains a higher ability to replicate. Therefore, these findings further underscore the pandemic potential of the H9N2 AIV and provide mechanistic insights into the replication and virulence of this influenza virus among mammalian hosts.",
