For example, their genomes can be made up of DNA or RNA, and within the RNA viruses the genomes may be positive-sense RNA, negative-sense RNA, or dsRNA. Production of mRNA transcripts may take place in the nucleus and therefore the virus can make use of host cell enzymes. Alternatively, this process may occur in the cytoplasm, in which case the virus must encode, or bring with it, its own transcriptional system. Viral mRNAs also differ in their structure; some viral mRNAs are capped and polyadenylated, and these viruses often adopt novel ways in which to ensure the viral mRNAs are preferentially translated over cellular mRNAs, either through modification of the host cell translational machinery and/or adoption of novel translational mechanisms. There are also a large number of viruses that do not produce capped mRNAs and have evolved novel strategies to direct initiation of protein synthesis.",

The virus encodes homologs of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)4E, eIF4A, and eIF1 and also possesses a homolog of the release factor eRF1. Although the virus therefore encodes proteins involved in all stages of translation, it does not encode any ribosomal components. It has been speculated2 that these viral components probably represent the remains of a more complex translational system that has been gradually lost over time, rather than an acquisition of cellular components.",

For initiation to occur the eIF4F complex, comprised of the cap-binding protein eIF4E, the helicase eIF4A, and the bridging protein eIF4G, binds to the mRNA. The 40S ribosomal subunit is recruited via an eIF4G\u2013eIF3\u201340S interaction together with the ternary complex, which contains eIF2, GTP, and initiator met-tRNAi. The resulting complex is known as the 48S complex. The scanning model of translation initiation predicts that this complex then scans along the mRNA until the start codon is reached.3\n",

These include upstream open reading frames (uORFs), microRNA (miRNA) target sites, and polyadenylation elements.7, 8 Transcription of mRNAs from mammalian DNA virus genomes such as herpesviruses and adenoviruses occur in the nucleus and results in the production of capped viral mRNAs. These viruses need to establish conditions to permit selective translation of viral mRNAs over cellular transcripts. It is therefore desirable to stimulate cap-dependent translation pathways and at the same time inhibit or downregulate the translation of host mRNAs, which otherwise would be similarly stimulated, to provide the virus with a selective advantage.",

These viruses establish latent infections during which a restricted subset of viral mRNAs is expressed at a low level, so that the virus evades the host immune system. The virus replication may undergo periodic reactivation to a productive lytic infectious cycle, accompanied by major changes in viral gene expression.

The picornaviruses have uncapped mRNAs that are translated by the cap-independent mechanism of internal ribosome entry. Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and, to a lesser extent, PV, affect 4E-BP activity by increasing the ability of this protein to bind to and sequester eIF4E in order to silence cap-dependent translation of host mRNAs and permit selective translation of EMCV and PV mRNAs.19 Upon infection with EMCV, 4E-BP1 becomes dephosphorylated, and this coincides with the shutoff of protein synthesis that occurs. Dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in PV-infected cells lags behind the shutoff of cellular protein synthesis, and it appears that in this situation protein synthesis inhibition is initiated by the cleavage of eIF4G. Further evidence of a role for dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in inhibition of protein synthesis during EMCV and PV infections was demonstrated by addition of rapamycin, an inhibitor of 4E-BP phosphorylation, to virus-infected cells. This results in enhanced synthesis of EMCV and PV viral proteins.20\n",

Interestingly, no corresponding increase in the level of PABP association with the eIF4F complex was observed, and PABP was seen to redistribute from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. This is perhaps surprising given the role of PABP in stimulating translation.5 It was suggested that alternative eIF4F complexes lacking PABP could selectively promote the synthesis of viral, but not host, proteins, so that KSHV-encoded mRNAs would compete more effectively for host translation machinery in infected cells.15\n",

Adenovirus mRNAs are capped, but they are selectively translated during late viral infection. During this stage, the first protein to be synthesized is the 100 K protein, encoded by the L4 transcription unit, and this is produced in very large amounts.30 The 100 K protein then binds to the carboxyl-terminus of eIF4G at, or near, the site that is normally occupied by the eIF4E kinase Mnk1. By competing with Mnk1 for binding, the 100 K protein acts as a direct inhibitor of Mnk1 and displaces this protein from eIF4G.31, 32 The removal of Mnk1 from eIF4G results in the dephosphorylation of eIF4E, which is thought to be associated with the inhibition of cellular cap-dependent translation, although the precise mechanism by which this occurs is not understood. Late AdV mRNAs are capped but are still translated when cellular protein synthesis is inhibited as they possess a common 5\u2032-noncoding region (5\u2032-NCR) known as the tripartite leader. The tripartite leader allows the late mRNAs to be selectively translated by an alternate mechanism of initiation known as ribosome shunting. During late infection, the 100 K protein enhances the binding of eIF4G and eIF4A to the tripartite leader complex at the 5\u2032 end of the adenovirus mRNA.33 The activity of the 100 K protein is stimulated by tyrosine phosphorylation,33 and this phosphorylation event is necessary to promote viral translation following shunting and does not affect the binding of this protein to eIF4G.",

Infection with feline calicivirus (FCV) induces cleavage of eIF4GI and II, somewhat closer to the N-terminus than the picornavirus 2A protease cleavage site.44 This cleavage occurs late in infection and correlates with host translational shutdown. Despite this induction of cleavage, FCV requires intact eIF4G to mediate translation of viral mRNAs. It may be that in this case, cleavage of eIF4GI results in a cleavage product that retains the eIF4E-binding site, but removes the PABP-binding site. This would make sense as FCV mRNA translation requires eIF4E,45 although the PABP requirement is currently unknown. However, translation of mRNA from the related calicivirus murine norovirus (MNV) is insensitive to FMDV L-protease treatment and it therefore seems that intact eIF4G is not required for translation of MNV mRNAs.46 It appears that even within the same family of viruses, different requirements for specific initiation factors in viral translation exist.",

As these two processes are occurring in opposite directions on the same RNA, it is believed that something must stall translation to allow replication to occur. It has also been shown recently that HAV 3C protease cleaves PABP in vivo and in vitro.\n57 The resulting N-terminal cleavage product binds to the HAV 5\u2032-UTR (to the pY1 region upstream of the IRES) and suppresses translation of the HAV mRNA. HAV does not induce host cell shutoff and infection does not result in cleavage of eIF4G. A model has been proposed in which PABP binds to the poly(A) tail on the HAV RNA early in infection and stimulates translation. Once enough viral proteins have accumulated, the 3C protease cleaves PABP and the N-terminal cleavage product binds to the pY1 region of the 5\u2032-UTR of HAV RNA, inhibiting translation. The RNA is then cleared of ribosomes to allow replication to occur in the opposite direction.57\n",

Rotaviruses cause gastroenteritis and infect many animal species; in humans, they are responsible for severe diarrheal disease in infants which is a cause of high mortality in the developing world. These viruses replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells where capped, nonpolyadenylated viral mRNAs are made.60 The rotavirus nonstructural protein NSP3 binds to the N-terminal region of eIF4GI, both in vitro and in infected cells and also binds to the 3\u2032-terminal sequence common to all rotavirus mRNAs, similar to PABP binding to cellular mRNAs.61 Rotavirus-infected cells also undergo inhibition of cellular protein synthesis and this has been attributed to the novel action of the NSP3 protein. The NSP3 protein specifically evicts PABP from the eIF4F complex by competing for binding to eIF4GI. In spite of this similar function, there is no sequence homology between PABP and NSP3. It is therefore believed that NSP3 binding to a consensus sequence in the 3\u2032 end of rotavirus mRNAs recruits the eIF4F complex to the viral mRNAs via NSP3 binding to eIF4GI, effectively circularizing the viral mRNAs. It has been proposed that NSP3 functions in a similar way to PABP binding to polyadenylated eukaryotic mRNAs. However, more recent data have questioned this model as it has been demonstrated that NSP3 (and its interaction with eIF4GI) is not required for rotavirus mRNA translation.62 In this study, RNAi-induced silencing of NSP3 in infected cells had no effect on viral protein production (except NSP3) or virus replication, although it did result in a less severe shutoff of host cell protein synthesis. In fact, viral progeny production was enhanced in the NSP3-silenced cells. Similarly, these authors suggested that eIF4GI is also not required for viral protein synthesis, as silencing of this factor also had no effect on virus production. A new model on the role of NSP3 was put forward that proposes that binding of NSP3 to the viral mRNAs either protects them from degradation or prevents binding of the virus polymerase, thereby ensuring they are utilized for translation.62 The exact role remains to be determined.",

Type I IRESs are found in entero- and rhinoviruses, such as PV, and recruit ribosomes to an AUG codon at the 3\u2032 end of the IRES. A ribosomal scanning process then transports the 40S subunit and associated factors to the next AUG codon further downstream, where translation initiation occurs. Type II IRESs, located in cardio- and aphthovirus mRNAs (e.g., EMCV), are similar in length to type I IRESs, at about 450 nucleotides (nt). They also recruit the 40S ribosomal subunit directly to an AUG codon at the 3\u2032 end of the IRES, but in this case this AUG is the initiation codon67 (Fig. 3\n). The FMDV IRES is structurally related to the type II IRESs, but only a minority of translation initiation occurs at the site of ribosome recruitment. The remaining ribosomes initiate translation at the next AUG downstream following a scanning process, so this IRES uses a hybrid of type I and type II mechanisms.",

Well-characterized examples include the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), which was first shown to interact with the human rhinovirus (HRV),70 and was subsequently found to be required for efficient PV and EMCV translation in cells.71 A role for the autoantigen La in stimulation of PV IRES activity has also been demonstrated in vitro and in cell culture.72 ITAFs are thought to act by modulating the secondary structure of the IRES such that canonical initiation factors are more effectively recruited, and such a role was demonstrated for PTB and ITAF45 binding to the FMDV IRES73 and more recently in cells.74\n",

This activity was mediated by VA RNAI competition with pre-miRNAs and shRNAs for binding to both exportin-5, required for pre-miRNA export from the nucleus, and to the cytoplasmic processing enzyme Dicer.128 VA-derived small RNAs also compete with endogenous miRNAs for incorporation into the RISC.109 VA RNAI is expressed at very high levels in infected cells, so it is possible that its interference with the miRNA and RNAi pathways may be a consequence of this expression and have little functional relevance for the virus.

Influenza virus is well known for causing pandemic outbreaks and is a zoonotic disease, infecting pigs, avian species and horses, as well as humans. Influenza A viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family and have a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome which is made up of eight segments. In influenza virus-infected cells there is a dramatic inhibition of host cell translation while the viral mRNAs are selectively translated.139 It is well established that influenza virus mRNAs acquire their 5\u2032 caps through a process of \u201ccap snatching\u201d or \u201ccap stealing\u201d during which the virus polymerase complex \u201csnatches\u201d the 5\u2032 10\u201312 nt from host nuclear mRNAs which then prime the synthesis of viral mRNAs. The viral mRNAs therefore contain host cell sequences at their 5\u2032 ends, which are followed by conserved viral sequences that are known to bind the viral polymerase. It is believed that polymerase binding to these conserved sequences prevents the snatching of caps from the viral mRNAs140 and contributes to the selective translation of viral mRNAs during infection; the cellular mRNAs being degraded once decapped. The polymerase itself is a complex of three subunits, PA, PB1, and PB2. The PB1 subunit is involved in binding to the caps on cellular mRNAs that are then thought to be cleaved by the endonuclease activity of the polymerase. The crystal structure of the PA subunit has recently been solved and the endonuclease active site was shown to reside in the amino-terminal end of the protein.141, 142\n",

The RNA pseudoknot interacts with the ribosome in close association with the putative 80S helicase at the entrance to the mRNA channel as well as with the 18S rRNA helix 16, rpS9, rpS2, and the ubiquitous eukaryotic ribosomal regulatory protein RACK1. Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) was shown to be trapped in the A site of the ribosome and this would prevent binding of tRNA to this site until the frameshift has been completed. In the presence of the pseudoknot the P site tRNA is distorted and bent toward the A site that contains eEF2. Taken together these data allowed the following three step model for frameshifting to be proposed.152\n(i)The helicase at the entrance of the mRNA tunnel on the elongating ribosome is unable to unwind the pseudoknot structure in the mRNA, pausing the ribosome.(ii)The blockage imposed by the pseudoknot partially inhibits the movement of the tRNA, bound to the mRNA by the codon\u2013anticodon pairing, during translocation. The tRNA is unable to return to the A site due to the presence of eEF2, and the resulting strain on the tRNA causes it to bend in a (+) sense direction such that it now moves to the roof of the P site.(iii)Due to the strain of these opposing forces the codon\u2013anticodon interactions breaks. The tRNA then relaxes and moves in the (\u2212) sense 5\u2032 direction and repairs with the mRNA in the \u2212 1 position.152\n\n",

There is an 11 bp helical stem and a highly ordered hairpin loop, the top of which contains an ACAA tetraloop (Fig. 6). A less stable stem is also present which is separated from the upper loop.148, 166 It has been suggested that the lower stem acts as a \u201cpositioning element\u201d that permits the stem-loop to induce the ribosomal pausing required to perturb ribosome translocation.166\n",

The subgenomic mRNA encoding the structural proteins of FCV is bicistronic with two overlapping cistrons. The first ORF of the RNA encodes the viral major capsid protein (VP1) and the second cistron encodes the minor capsid protein VP2. The two uORFs overlap by 4 nt in FCV (A\nUGA), one in norovirus (UAA\nUG) and eight in rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (AUGUCUGA).173, 174 The expression of the downstream ORF requires a termination\u2013reinitiation event which is different from those identified in mammalian systems studied to date since it is independent of eIF4G or the eIF4F complex. Instead reinitiation requires an interaction of eIF3 and the 40 S ribosomal subunit with a sequence element that is present in the 3\u2032-terminal 70 nt of the upstream ORF, denoted the termination upstream ribosomal-binding site (TURBS).175, 176 Two short sequence motifs present in TURBS are required for reinitiation, the first of which is a pentameric UGGGA sequence that is complementary to the apical loop of helix 26 in the mammalian 18S rRNA. Evidence for a direct interaction between FCV mRNA and 18S rRNA was obtained using a yeast model system where mutations were introduced into both RNAs.128 Thus when the yeast 18S rRNA was mutated such that it was adapted to the FCV sequence or vice versa there was a dramatic increase in the translation of the downstream frame.128 This UGGA motif is conserved in caliciviruses.175 The second motif is not conserved among caliciviruses but is located at an equivalent position in the TURBS of FCV and RHDV,175 and it is the secondary structure of these sequences, and not the primary sequence, that is important for function.176 It has been proposed that the binding of posttermination eIF3/40S complexes to TURBS retains them in a position suitable for reinitiation once they have acquired the eIF2/GTP/Met tRNAi ternary complex.175, 176 In agreement with this hypothesis it has been shown that eIF3 is involved in termination and recycling of ribosomal complexes, thus providing in part an explanation for the interaction of eIF3 with the 40S ribosomal subunit (Ref. 177 and discussed in the chapter by Fraser, this volume).",

The most important region is not between the overlapping cistrons, but is located 150 nts upstream in the M2-1 ORF and contains stable structural elements.184, 185 A similar mechanism is used to initiate the translation of M2-2 transcripts of APV and hMPV, although there are differences in the efficiencies of the process, which appear to be due to lack of stimulatory sequences in the M2-1 ORF.185 The reinitiation mechanism is likely to be quite different from that found in influenza BM2 and calicivirus subgenomic mRNAs, but may well involve the same principle of capturing some of the posttermination 40S subunits and restraining them in a position suitable for reinitiation.",

During early stages of infection there is a production of proteins for viral DNA replication whereas in late infection this switches to proteins that are required for the assembly of viral capsids.186 Most late adenovirus transcription is initiated from the major late promoter (MLP). mRNAs derived from this promoter all possess a common 5\u2032-NCR of 212 nt in length called the tripartite leader which arises from splicing of three small exons.187, 188 There is an inhibition of host protein synthesis following adenovirus infection. The continued selective translation of viral mRNAs under these conditions is due to the presence of the tripartite leader which is able to direct ribosome shunting.189, 190 Shunting involves the loading of the 40S subunit at the 5\u2032 end of the capped tripartite leader-containing mRNAs, followed by linear scanning over a short distance and then a direct translocation of the 40S subunits via \u201cshunting elements\u201d to the start codon.190 Within the tripartite leader, the elements that are required for translation initiation during late viral infection are an unstructured 5\u2032 end to the mRNA189 and hairpin structures that have complementarity to the 18S rRNA at the 3\u2032 end.190\n",

This is similar to the mammalian reovirus sigma 1 protein that has a function in cell adhesion.193 Analysis of the start codons of these three ORFs revealed that the first AUG codon is in a suboptimal context, whereas the sequence surrounding the AUG of the second uORF provides a good context for translation initiation with a highly conserved A at the \u2212 3 position. The start codon of sigma C is in a strong context but it is a considerable distance from the 5\u2032-terminal cap structure.194 By altering the sequences surround the AUGs of the uORFs that encoded the p10 and p17 proteins to optimal contexts it was shown that the coordinated expression of these proteins occurred by leaky scanning.194 However, the translation initiation of sigma C was shown to be independent of leaking scanning, reinitation, and internal ribosome entry and it was proposed that sigma C translation is mediated by an atypical shunting mechanism.194\n",

A sixth start codon is located more than 1500 nt from the 5\u2032 end, and together these generate eight protein products, as alternative C-termini are also used.195 Initiation from the first three start codons, which are ACG, AUG, and AUG, can be explained by the leaky scanning model. The sequence that surrounds the first unusual ACG codon is in an otherwise optimal context (GCCACG\nGAT) with a purine at + 4 and \u2212 3.196 If the ACG sequence is mutated to AUG there is increased expression of the encoded C\u2032 protein, but the expression of the P and C proteins initiated from the second and third start codons is ablated, presumably because there is no leaky scanning. The expression of the proteins from the downstream start codons is not affected under these circumstances, suggesting that the initiation of these proteins is independent of scanning.197, 198 It was shown that in vitro translation of these downstream Y proteins was initiated by ribosomal shunting,195 but in vivo this occurred by both shunting and proteolytic processing of the C\u2032 and/or C proteins.199\n",

Interestingly, the 2A peptide is active when placed between reporter proteins and the cleavage reaction is not therefore dependent on viral (protease) sequences outside of this region.200 Instead the data suggest that the 2A peptide is able to interact with the ribosome and direct translational recoding.201 A detailed analysis of this recoding reaction shows that the ribosomes pause over the final amino acid of the 2A peptide. The recruitment of release factors to this peptide catalyzes termination and releases the peptide, the sequence of which includes the penultimate amino acid encoded by this region (glycine), while the codon of the terminal amino acid (proline) remains in the A site of the ribosome.201 These 2A like peptides have been termed CHYSEL (cis-acting hydrolase element) peptides and their ability to act independently of any proteolytic activity in the \u201chost\u201d cell has lead to a number of biotechnological uses.201\n",

Against these, there is evolutionary pressure on the host to elaborate antiviral defense mechanisms, which in turn puts pressure on the viruses to develop mechanisms of negating or bypassing these host cell defenses.

This is in part due to the fact that, irrespective of whether the viral genome is DNA or RNA, positive or negative strand, double or single stranded, all viruses are dependent on the cellular protein synthesis machinery, whereas they vary in their dependence on other facets of host-cell gene expression. The contribution of virus research to our understanding of mRNA structure and function, and the mechanism of protein biosynthesis is highlighted by the following list of discoveries (in approximate chronological order) all made through exploiting viruses: eubacterial translation initiation sites (RNA bacteriophages), poly(A) tails (vaccinia), 5\u2032 caps (reovirus), PKR (PV), translation of only the first cistron of polycistronic mRNAs (tobacco mosaic virus), leaky termination (plant RNA viruses), the scanning ribosome mechanism (reovirus), eIF4G (PV), IRESs (picornaviruses), programmed-1 frame-shifting (retroviruses and coronaviruses), ribosome shunting (adenovirus), and reinitiation after translation of a long ORF (pneumoviruses, caliciviruses, influenza B viruses). Moreover, this list has not closed because there are unusual viral RNA translation mechanisms that remain to be fully elucidated, for example, the extraordinary translational stop\u2013restart mechanism promoted by the FMDV 2A peptide. Some of the earlier discoveries in the above list exploited the fact that in the era before recombinant DNA techniques and transcription vectors had been developed, viruses were often the best source of a single mRNA species (e.g., PV, tobacco mosaic virus) or a very limited number of mRNAs (reovirus), with the added advantage of being able to synthesize defined radiolabeled mRNAs in some cases (e.g., reovirus). Viruses also provide excellent tools with which to study cellular protein synthesis or novel viral mechanisms of initiation. For example, the picornavirus proteases that cleave eIF4G are widely used to study cap-independent mechanisms of initiation, and a range of viral IRES elements that require different factors for function are routinely used to dissect translational control processes, such as miRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression. However, the more recent discoveries are due to the fact that viruses, particularly positive-strand RNA viruses with small genomes, have evolved to exploit the extremes of behavior (or what might be thought the weaknesses) in the host cell translation machinery (e.g., programmed frameshifting, leaky termination, shunting, reinitiation after a long ORF). Some of these viral \u201ctricks\u201d (e.g., IRESs, and perhaps shunting) have evolved to enable efficient viral protein synthesis to proceed despite the virus-induced shutdown of host cell protein synthesis, and, certainly in the case of IRESs, the discovery has proved highly relevant to mRNA translation in the uninfected host cell.",

It is not yet clear whether these events also occur in the translation of some cellular mRNAs. If they do, they certainly concern only a very limited number of cellular mRNAs, and without the clues provided by the viral examples as to the sequence and structure of the required RNA motifs, the task of identifying such cellular mRNAs would be like trying to find the proverbial needle in a field of haystacks. Even if they do not occur in any cellular mRNA, the viral mechanisms are always instructive, because they provide insights into issues such as why does reinitiation after a long ORF not normally occur with the vast majority of cellular mRNAs. Moreover, if the viral mRNA motifs directing leaky termination, frameshifting, or reinitiation after a long ORF, are absent from all essential cellular mRNAs, they provide potential targets for the development of novel antiviral agents targeted against the intracellular phase of the infectious process (although the high mutation rate of RNA viruses may well pose problems with this approach).
