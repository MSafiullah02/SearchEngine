The RSVs were detected using the respiratory virus panel fast assay and single-tube RT-PCR, their nucleotides were sequenced, and they were tested for positive selection. Of the 165 positive samples, 131 (79.4%) carried RSV-A and 34 (20.6%) RSV-B; both groups co-circulated in all of the study periods, with RSV-A predominating in all the seasons except for winter 2010-2011, which had a predominance of RSV-B. Phylogenetic analysis of the RSV-A sequences identified genotypes NA1 and ON1, the second replacing the first during the last two years of the study period. The RSV-B belonged to genotypes BA9 and BA10. BA9 was detected in all the years of the study whereas BA only desultorily. Comparison of the subjects infected by RSV-A and RSV-B types did not reveal any significant differences, but the children infected by genotype A/NA1 more frequently had lower respiratory tract infections (p<0.0001) and required hospitalisation (p = 0.007) more often than those infected by genotype A/ON1. These findings show that RSV has complex patterns of circulation characterised by the periodical replacement of the predominant genotypes, and indicate that the circulation and pathogenic role of the different RSV strains should be investigated as each may have a different impact on the host. A knowledge of the correlations between types, genotypes and disease severity may also be important in order to be able to include the more virulent strains in future vaccines.",

F protein is conserved, whereas the C-terminal third hypervariable region of the G protein is subject to rapid mutation [2] . On the basis of their reactions with monoclonal antibodies, the viral strains have been separated into two major serotypes (RSV-A and RSV-B), and nucleotide sequence analysis has led to the identification of 11 RSV-A (GA1-GA7, SAA1, NA1-NA2, and ON1) [2] [3] [4] and 23 RSV-B genotypes, (GB1-GB4, SAB1-SAB3, SAB4, URU1, URU2, BA1-BA12 and THB) [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .

The p-distances within the NA1 and ON1 genotypes were respectively 2.4 \u00b1 0.3% and 2.3 \u00b1 0.5%, and the p-distance between NA1 and ON1 was 5.2 \u00b1 1.2%. The NA1 strain sequences were characterised by N237D/Y amino acid substitutions, a change involved in the loss of a potential glycosylation site in position 237. Only three sequences (MI-3521-Jan2011, mi-3517-Dec2011, and Mi-73-Dec2011) were observed with a recovered N-glycosylation site in positon 237. It is worth noting that two divergent clusters (highlighted in grey in Fig 1) were identified with several amino acid changes: one characterised by amino acid changes P222L, E232G, K233E, K240R and N242S, and the other by amino acid changes P234S, T239A, I243T, S250T and S277P. RSV-A NA1 was the only genotype identified in the samples collected during the winter seasons between 2009-2010 to 2011-2012, but was no longer present in the later samples. A single swab was positive for genotype ON1 in 2011-2012, but this genotype subsequently completely replaced NA1. The RSV-A strains belonging to the ON1 genotype were characterised by amino acid changes E232G, T253K and P290L (RSV-A NA1 numbering). Within the ON1 genotype, three different phylogenetic subgroups (group A: n = 29 strains; group A1; n = 16 strains; and group B: n = 24 strains), could be distinguished in the phylogenetic tree shown in Fig 1 on the basis of some amino acid substitutions in comparison with the first-described ON1 strain. The sequences belonging to group A were characterised by amino acid changes L274P, L298P and Y304H, and those in group A1 by the amino acid changes G254E, Y273H and Y297H; no unique amino acid changes were observed in the sequences belonging to group B.",

            "text": "The findings of this study show that RSV has complex circulation patterns that are characterised by the periodic replacement of the predominant genotypes with new ones during successive epidemic seasons. As previously found in other countries [13, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] and Central Italy [16] , the new RSV-A/ON1 strain emerged in Northern Italy in 2011-2012, and soon completely replaced the previously dominant RSV-A/NA1 strain. In addition, as recently occurred in Japan [10] , RSV-B/BA9 was predominant between RSV-B viruses. It was identified in all the years of the study, whereas detection of RSV-B/BA10 was limited to 2010-2011 and 2012-2013 seasons. Phylogenetic and deduced amino acid sequence analyses of the RSV strains revealed that ongoing changes characterised the different clusters in the RSV-A tree [31, 32] . Interestingly, almost all of the Italian NA1 strains lost the first N-glycosylation site due to substitution N237D [5] , whereas this N-glycosylation site was restored in three NA1 and all ON1 strains. The NA1 strains fell into two clusters characterised by a number of amino acid changes, but it is not clear how these changes favoured the evasion of the host immune response. The ON1 genotype was characterised by E232G, T253K and P292L substitutions, as previously reported in Chinese strains [33] , and other cluster-specific mutations were observed in ON1 clusters A (L274P, L298P and 310P) and A1 (G254E, Y273H, and Y297H) [18, 34] . It has been suggested that the evolution of the major antigens of RSV and other respiratory viruses is associated with selective pressure due to host immune responses [35] . Our search for phylogenetic signatures of selective pressure in RSV-A and RVS-B showed that the RSV genes have predominantly negatively or neutrally selected evolving sites. Only a minority were under positive selection, thus suggesting that the forces driving the evolution of RSV are mainly stochastic. However, additional investigations are needed to evaluate whether amino acid changes in the G protein may help the virus to alter the antigenic characteristics leading to an evolutionary advantage.",

This permitted to have precise information regarding the real pathogenic role of this virus avoiding the risk of misinformation that can occur when all the RSV infections, including co-infections between RSV and other respiratory viruses, are studied. However, only children aged < 2 years attending the Emergency Room were enrolled. Moreover, in comparison to RSV-B, a significant greater number of RSV-A positive cases was identified. These are limits that do not allow to draw firm conclusions about the real global clinical relevance of the different RSV types in paediatrics. RSV infection is more severe in younger children and mild to moderate infections are usually followed by primary care paediatricians in the community [1] . However, in the study population, we did not find any difference in the severity of the disease due to RSV-A and RSV-B strains. This finding is in line those of some previous studies [39] [40] [41] , but conflicts with those of other epidemiological evaluations showing a significantly higher risk of severe disease due to type A [42] [43] [44] [45] or type B [46] . Moreover, it is not agree with findings in various cell culture and in vivo models suggesting that individual RSV-A strains may be more infective, virulent and immunopathogenic [1] . In this regard, it is interesting to note the findings of a recent in vitro study of primary epithelial cells and epithelial cell lines, which suggest that prototypical RSV-A and RSV-B strains are differently capable of inducing nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation (i.e. an important step in the cascade of events leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines) and the subsequent induction of the NF-\u03baB responsive genes interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8, with RSV-B eliciting significantly weaker responses than RSV-A [47] .",

The greater severity of the infections due to RSV-A/NA1 in comparison with RSV-A/ON1 suggest that different RSV genotypes may be associated with different degrees of virulence, and that the relevance of one RSV type in clinical practice may depend on the incidence of infections due to the most virulent genotype during the period of the epidemiological evaluation. A simple evaluation of RSV type is not enough to predict the risk of severe infection during epidemics, and only studies specifically planned to evaluate the virulence of the different genotypes can allow a precise assessment of what can be expected when a particular genotype is in circulation.",

This is in line with the findings of other authors [16, 17, 31, 48] , although Prifert et al. observed that a considerable number of children with A/ON1 infection were admitted to an intensive care unit [31] , possibly because they only enrolled children with LRTIs. The lower virulence of A/ON1 also seems to be further supported by our finding that the clinical manifestations due to A/ON1 infection were significantly less severe than those due to the simultaneously circulating B/BA9 and B/BA10 viruses. Similar data have been reported by Panayiotou et al. [48] , who showed that patients infected with RSV-A/ON1 had a significantly lower mean severity score than children with B/BA infection.",
