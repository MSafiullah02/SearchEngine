            "text": "The contrasting social and antisocial effects of alcohol consumption must have become evident shortly after the discovery of winemaking. Time has only augmented our understanding of the multifaceted nature of this Dr Jekyll\u2013Mr Hyde phenomenon. It is clear that excessive alcohol consumption, both acute and chronic, can have devastating effects on physical and mental well-being. Excessive ethanol consumption can cause cirrhosis of the liver, increase the likelihood of hypertension and stroke, favor the development of breast and digestive tract cancers, and induce fetal alcohol syndrome. Many of these effects may stem from the activation of free-radical damage induced by high alcohol intake (Meagher et al., 1999). Because the problems associated with alcoholism (Abrams et al., 1987; Schmitz and Gray, 1998), and the cerebral chemical changes associated with addiction (Nestler and Malenka, 2004; Heinz, 2006) have been well documented, they will not be discussed here. On the other hand, it is becoming equally clear that moderate wine consumption (250\u2013300 ml/day \u2013 about one-third of a 750-ml bottle) has distinct health benefits. Multiple epidemiological studies suggest that daily, moderate, alcohol consumption (Thun et al., 1997; Doll et al., 2005), and especially wine (Gr\u00f8nb\u00e6k et al., 2000; Renaud et al., 2004) is associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality. This is expressed in a U-shaped curve, with increased mortality being associated with both excess alcohol intake and abstinence. This is particularly evident in the reduced incidence of cardiovascular disease in moderate alcohol consumers. In addition, it reduces the likelihood of type 2 diabetes, combats hypertension, and reduces the frequency of certain cancers and several other diseases. These epidemiological correlations are being supported by in vivo studies that provide molecular explanations for these associations. The principal element missing in confirming a causal relationship involves detailed information on the dynamics of absorption, metabolism, and elimination of the proposed active ingredients.",

Ancient Greek and Roman society used wine extensively in herbal infusions. This practice continued largely unabated until the beginning of the twentieth century. The excessive abuse of distilled alcoholic beverages, combined with religious and political conservatism, created a backlash against all beverages containing alcohol, notably in North America. Alcohol was viewed as an agent of corruption to be annihilated. Following the failure of Prohibition, humans themselves, not alcohol, came to be viewed as the source of evil. Alcoholism is now appropriately viewed as a genuine disease, possessing a complex etiology (Nurnberger and Bierut, 2007), with both genetic and environmental aspects. Thus, the social climate is changing, and the legitimate use of wine in medicine and health is being investigated seriously.",

The primary (constitutive) mechanism involves the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde, through the action of cytoplasmic alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs). Of the seven known ADH genes, three function in the liver. The others act in the gastric epithelium and other tissues. Subsequent oxidation converts acetaldehyde to acetic acid. This occurs principally under the action of mitochondrial acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2). Cytoplasmic acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH1) is less active. The acetic acid may be released into the blood or converted to acetyl CoA. From this point, metabolism may flow along any of the standard biochemical pathways (Fig. 7.15).",

For example, ADH1B*1 codes for an isozyme that oxidizes ethanol slowly, whereas ADH1B*3 encodes for a highly active version (about 30 times more efficient) (Thomasson et al., 1995). These allelic variants are common among African Americans. Fast and slow acting isozymes of ADH1C are common in Europeans. Rapid alcohol oxidation may donate a degree of protection against alcoholism, by quickly converting ethanol to acetaldehyde. Such individuals tend to drink less and show more rapid and marked negative consequences to alcohol consumption than do those metabolizing alcohol more slowly (Wall et al., 2005). However, this probably reduces some of the health benefits of ethanol consumption. The effect of mutants of mitochondrial acetaldehyde dehydrogenase gene (ALDH2) is discussed below.",

The activation of the microsomal oxidation pathway has the undesirable side-effect of generating free oxygen radicals (Meagher et al., 1999). The free-radical activity can remain long after alcohol intake has ceased. Although most free oxygen radicals are inactivated by glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase, long-term exposure to trace amounts of oxygen radicals may induce the slow, progressive accumulation of irreparable cellular damage.

It may be involved in much of the chronic damage associated with alcoholism. At low rates of alcohol intake, acetaldehyde metabolism is sufficiently rapid to limit its accumulation and liberation from the liver. At higher concentrations, acetaldehyde rapidly consumes glutathione reserves in the liver \u2013 an crucial cellular antioxidant. This coincides with activation of the microsomal ethanol oxidation pathway that generates toxic free-oxygen radicals. In the absence of sufficient glutathione, free-oxygen radicals can accumulate, disrupting mitochondrial function. Elsewhere in the body, acetaldehyde can bind with proteins and cellular constituents, forming stable complexes (Niemela and Parkkila, 2004). These can lead to the production of immunogenic determinants, which can stimulate antibody production against acetaldehyde adducts. This may generate some of the chronic tissue damage associated with alcohol abuse (Niemela and Israel, 1992). The binding of acetaldehyde to the plasma membrane of red blood cells is known to increase their rigidity. By limiting their ability to squeeze through the narrowest capillaries, oxygen supply to tissue cells may be restricted. This could participate in suppressed brain function. Nerve cells show only respiratory (oxygen-dependent) metabolism. It is estimated that the brain consumes up to 20% of the blood's oxygen supply.",

In addition, wine promotes the release of gastrin as well as gastric juices. Succinic acid is the principal wine ingredient activating the release of gastric juices (Teyssen et al., 1999). It does not, however, activate gastrin release. The substance(s) involved in stimulating gastrin secretion are unknown. Wine also significantly delays gastric emptying, both on an empty stomach (Franke et al., 2004), or when consumed with food (Benini et al., 2003). The latter favors digestion by extending acid hydrolysis. It also promotes inactivation of pathogenic food contaminants. In addition, wine slows plasma glucose uptake, independent of any insulin response (Benini et al., 2003). Furthermore, at the levels found in most table wines, ethanol activates the release of bile in the intestines. Wine acids and aromatics also induce the same effects. In contrast, the high alcohol content of distilled beverages can suppress digestive juice flow, the release of bile, and induce stomach spasms.",

These transformations could significantly affect their antioxidant and other properties, as well as their ability to move into tissues. Most of these metabolites still retain a reducing phenolic group, and, thus, may possess antioxidant properties. Nevertheless, there is growing evidence that phenolic metabolites act primarily as signaling molecules, notably in oxygen-stress-related pathways (Williams et al., 2004). Smaller amounts of chemical are needed for signaling reactions, than direct antioxidant effects. This might explain the discrepancy between the low levels of free phenolics in the plasma and their apparent effects in the body. Future studies will have to investigate the efficacy of phenolic metabolites and conjugated complexes, at concentrations found in the plasma. Their efficacy at binding to, or translocation into tissue cells, is little known. Survival of most of these constituents in the plasma is comparatively short (a few hours). Breakdown products of phenolic metabolism rapidly appear in urine shortly after uptake in the plasma.",

Nevertheless, alcohol is not particularly antimicrobial at the concentrations found in wine (optimal at about 70%). Thus, the antibiotic action of wine results primarily from other constituents, probably its phenolic content. Modification of anthocyanins during fermentation increases their toxicity to viruses, protozoans, and bacteria. Other phenolic compounds commonly found in red wines are also bacteriostatic and fungistatic. For example, p-coumaric acid is particularly active against gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus and Streptococcus, whereas other phenols inhibit gram-negative bacteria, for example Escherichia, Shigella, Proteus, and Vibrio (Masquelier, 1988). The latter cause serious forms of diarrhea and dysentery. Despite wine being more effective than antimicrobial agents, such as bismuth salicylate (Weisse et al., 1995), full action may take several hours (Maretr\u00f8 and Daeschel, 2004; Dolara et al., 2005). In most instances, the mechanism by which phenolics have their action is unknown. However, in the case of quercetin, the effect may be partially attributed to its inhibition of DNA gyrase, whereas with epigallocatechin, disruption of cell membrane function appears central to its antibiotic action. The low pH and presence of various organic acids appear to accentuate the antimicrobial action of both wine phenolics and ethanol. It is not without good reason that Roman armies added wine or vinegar to their drinking water. Diarrhetic soldiers do not win wars.",

Figure 12.2\nprovides an example of such results. Alcohol consumption also decreases the likelihood of intermittent claudication (pain or cramping in the calf of the leg). Claudication is a common indicator of peripheral arterial disease. Recent studies have confirmed that incidental factors, such as gender, race, lifestyle, educational level, etc. do not affect the results (for example, Mukamal et al., 2006). Studies have also demonstrated that daily consumption of alcohol significantly reduces the incidence of other forms of cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension (Keil et al., 1998), heart attack (Gaziano et al., 1999), stroke (Truelsen et al., 1998; Hillbom, 1999), and peripheral arterial disease (Camargo et al., 1997). Those who consume wine moderately live, on average, 2.5\u20133.5 years longer than teetotalers, and considerably longer than heavy drinkers. The prime area of contention is the degree to which these benefits accrue from the effects of ethanol vs. phenolic constituents (Rimm et al., 1996).",

However, in high concentrations, they may accumulate in the artery wall. If they remain there for an extended period, their lipid content tends to become oxidized. In an oxidized form, lipids are cytotoxic and indirectly irritate the artery wall. As a consequence, special adhesion proteins attach to the artery wall. Monocytes and helper T-cells of the immune system bond to these proteins. In addition, affected endothelial cells may secrete compounds, such as endothelin-1. Endothelin-1 activates the migration of monocytes and T-cells into the artery wall. Procyanidins, principally found in red wines, are particularly effective in suppressing the production of endothelin-1 (Corder et al., 2001). In the layer just underneath the endothelial lining (intima), monocytes mature into macrophages. Both macrophages and T-cells may release cytokines that further activate the immune system, involving localized inflammation. Activated macrophages tend to engulf oxidized LDLs. However, as the LDLs are not degraded, their progressive accumulation gives the macrophage the appearance of being full of bubbles. This has given rise to the term foam cells. They are the first clear evidence of the beginning of localized arterial swelling (plaques). Occasionally plaques enlarge inward, but more frequently they bulge outward into the surrounding tissue. Action of immune cells in the plaque also induces migration of smooth muscle cells from the artery wall into the intima. Here they proliferate and produce collagen, forming a fibrous cap over the plaque. Additional LDLs slowly collect, provoking further rounds of inflammation and enlargement of the plaque. These accretions may develop their own vasculature, becoming fibrous and inelastic. As the plaques enlarge, they may produce irregular protrusions into and block the artery lumen.",

For example, collagenases secreted by macrophages inhibit collagen synthesis by smooth muscle cells. Sudden rupture of a plaque permits blood infiltration into the plaque.

It is currently thought that plaque rupture is the principal factor inducting thrombus formation, and precipitating a heart attack, stroke, or other cardiovascular trauma.",

Either form tends to remove cholesterol from the arteries, transferring it to the liver for metabolism. HDLs also appear to interfere with LDL oxidation.

Nevertheless, the combined effect of several phenolics is superior to single compounds (Wallerath et al., 2005). The action partially results from the enhanced synthesis and release of nitric oxide by endothelial cells. Nitric oxide induces vasodilation (by relaxing vascular smooth muscle), and limits platelet adhesion to blood vessel endothelia. Indicative of the complexities of such interactions is the observation that flavonoids may also inactivate nitric oxide (Verhagen et al., 1997). In addition, nitric oxide, notably as peroxynitrile, oxidizes LDLs.",

In a study by Vally and Thompson (2001), wine containing 300 ppm sulfite induced a rapid drop in forced expiratory volume, reaching a maximal decline within about 5 min. Recovery took between 15 and 60 min. The same individuals did not respond to wine containing 20, 75, or 150 ppm sulfite.

Migraines may be induced by a wide range of environmental stimuli, possibly because migraines are themselves a complex of etiologically distinct events. The dilation of blood vessels in the brain, as a result of histamine release, can be the common element in many instances of headache development. When red vs. white wines were discovered to contain higher concentrations of biogenic amines, such as histamine and tyramine, there was the initial assumption that they were the culprits. However, it was later realized that the normal levels of histamine found in red wines are below those that generally trigger a migraine. In addition, double-blind studies have seemingly exonerated histamine in red-wine-induced migraine headaches (Masyczek and Ough, 1983). Nevertheless, alcohol can suppress the action of diamine oxidase, an important enzyme of the small intestine that inactivates histamine and other biogenic amines (Jarisch and Wantke, 1996). Thus, in individuals with histamine intolerance, sufficient histamine may enter the blood system to provoke a vascular headache. However, this view does not correlate with the observation that spirits and sparkling wine were more frequently associated with migraine attacks than other alcoholic beverages (Nicolodi and Sicuteri, 1999). Both spirits and sparkling wines are low in histamine content.",

Correspondingly, red wines are more frequently associated with headache production than white wines. On average red wines contain about 1200 mg/liter vs. 200 mg/liter for whites. Some phenolics suppress the action of platelet phenolsulfotransferase (PST) (Jones et al., 1995). Individuals having low levels of platelet-bound PST are apparently more susceptible to migraine headaches (Alam et al., 1997). Suppression of PST results in reduced sulfation (detoxification) of a variety of endogenous and xenobiotic (\u201cforeign\u201d) compounds, including biogenic amines and phenolics. Without inactivation, biogenic amines can activate the liberation of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, or serotonin), an important neurotransmitter in the brain. 5-HT also promotes platelet aggregation and the dilation of small blood vessels in the brain. The pressure so created can cause intercranial pain, and the instigation of a migraine (Pattichis et al., 1995). People prone to migraine headaches also may show abnormal and cyclical patterns in platelet sensitivity to 5-HT release (Jones et al., 1982; Peatfield et al., 1995). This may be involved in why wine consumption is not consistently linked to headache induction. Small phenolic components in wine also prolong the action of potent hormones and nerve transmitters, such as histamine, serotonin, dopamine, adrenalin and noradrenaline. These could affect headache severity and other allergic reactions.",

In contrast, their monomers are readily absorbed. This may explain why aged red wines (in which most tannins occur as large polymers) tend to be less associated with headache induction than their younger counterparts. A classic example is the ease with which the youngest of all red wines, Beaujolais nouveau,\nproduces headaches in those prone to their occurrence. Large tannin polymers remain largely unmodified until entering the colon, where bacteria metabolize them to low-molecular-weight phenolics (D\u00e9prez et al., 2000). Because this can take up to two days, they cannot be involved in headache induction. However, headache induction may result from monomeric phenolics, such as caffeic acid and catechins. Depending on their metabolism in the plasma, phenolics may be detoxified (o-methylated or sulfated), or made more \u2018toxic\u2019 (oxidized to o-quinones). o-Quinones can inhibit the action of the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). By so doing, the neurotransmitter dopamine is not broken down, and the availability of \u03bc-opinoid (painkilling) receptors is restricted. Consequently, the perception of pain associated with cerebral blood vessel dilation may be enhanced.",

Contraction of the membrane covering the brain (the dura) could pull on fibers attaching the dura to the skull, causing pain sensors to discharge.

The resultant disruption of normal nerve and muscle function could theoretically induce symptoms such as headache, nausea and fatigue. Ethanol can also induce the breakdown of glycogen in the liver.

For the majority of the adult population (except pregnant women), moderate wine consumption appears to have considerable health benefits. Nevertheless, there are several situations in which wine consumption, even in moderate amounts, can complicate or diminish the effectiveness of disease treatment.1.The acidic nature of wine can aggravate the inflammation and slow the natural healing of ulcers in the mouth, throat, stomach, and intestinal tract. Other constituents in wine may also be detrimental in this regard. Thus, all beverages containing alcohol are usually contraindicated in cases of gastritis, gastric cancer, and bleeding in the upper digestive tract. Nevertheless, the prophylactic action of red wine against Helicobacterium pylori and the suppression of histamine production by the gastric mucosa (Masquelier, 1986) may require a reconsideration of the old prohibition in mild cases. In the presence of pancreatitis, alcohol is absolutely contraindicated.2.Wine, along with other alcoholic beverages, may provoke gastroesophageal (acid) reflux in individual prone to this problem.3.\nIn liver disease, the consumption of wine is normally contraindicated. The presence of alcohol puts additional stress on an already weakened vital organ. Chronic alcohol abuse can lead to cirrhosis of the liver.4.In acute kidney infection, wine should be avoided. The consumption of alcohol increases the burden on an organ essential to eliminating toxic metabolic wastes.5.In prostatitis or genitourinary infections, the consumption of alcohol can complicate matters. The diuretic action of wine may increase the frequency of urination or, conversely, it may induce highly painful urinary retention.6.In epilepsy, the consumption of even moderate amounts of wine may increase the frequency of seizures.7.In patients about to undergo surgery, the effect of alcohol on reducing platelet aggregation is undesirable. Thus, it is recommended that patients terminate any alcohol (as well as aspirin) consumption before surgery. This avoids increasing the incidence of intra-and postoperative bleeding (Wolfort et al., 1996).\n",
