The sudden appearance of the virus leads to the limited existing therapies for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, vaccines and antiviral medicines are in desperate need. This study took immune-informatics approaches to identify B-and T-cell epitopes for surface glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2, followed by estimating their antigenicity and interactions with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. We identified four B cell epitopes, two MHC class-I and nine MHC class-II binding T-cell epitopes, which showed highly antigenic features. Allergenicity, toxicity and physiochemical properties analysis confirmed the specificity and selectivity of epitopes. The stability and safety of epitopes were confirmed by digestion analysis. No mutations were observed in all the selected B-and T-cell epitopes across all isolates from different locations worldwide. Epitopes were thus identified and some of them can be potential candidates for vaccine development.",

SARS-CoV-2 utilizes glycosylated spike (S) protein to gain entry into host cells. The S protein is a trimeric class I fusion protein and exists in a metastable prefusion conformation that undergoes a dramatic structural rearrangement to fuse the viral membrane with the host-cell membrane (Bosch BJ et al, 2003; Li F. 2016; Wrapp D, et al. 2020) . The S protein includes the receptor binding S1-subunit and the membrane fusion S2-subunit. The S1 subunit receptor-binding domain (RDB) is specifically recognized by the host receptor. When the S1 subunit binds to a host-cell receptor, the prefusion trimer is destabilized, resulting in the shedding of S1 subunit, and the state transition of S2 subunit to a stable postfusion conformation (Walls AC et al, 2017) . The critical function of the S protein can be a breakthrough in vaccine design and development.",

Developing an effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 is therefore a research priority. It is time-consuming and expensive to design novel vaccines against viruses by the use of kits and related antibodies (Qamar MT et al, 2018) . Thus, we chose the method of immune-informatics, which is more efficient and more applicable for deep analysis of viral antigens, B-and T-cell linear epitope prediction, and evaluation of immunogenicity and virulence of pathogens. Among those can be analyzed, B-cell can recognize and activate defense responses against viral infection, T-cell and antibody reactions may recover extreme respiratory infection.",

The antigenicity score of each peptide was calculated by VaxiJen v2.0 to evaluate its antigenicity. A peptide having both high antigenicity score and capacity to bind with larger number of alleles is considered to have high potentials to initiate a strong defense response. High stringent criteria were used to filter peptides with antigenicity score larger than or equal to 1 and the number of binding alleles larger than or equal to 3. Utilizing the evaluating method above, we obtained a total of 9 MHC class-I allele binding peptides ( Peptide_binding_to_MHC_class_II_molecules tool of IEDB and HLA class II set (Greenbaum J, et al, 2011 ) was utilized to predict T-cell epitopes for S protein.

Of the 1273 residues, 110 aa and 103 aa were found as negatively and positively charged, respectively. Theoretical iso-electric point (PI) of S protein was 6.24, reflecting its negative nature. The instability-index (II) was computed to be 33.01, which categories the S protein as stable. Aliphatic-index was 84.67 with GRAVY (grand average of hydropathicity) value of -0.079, which reveals a thought of proportional volume hold by aliphatic side chain. Half-life of the S protein was estimated as 30 hours for mammalian reticulocytes, > 20 hours for yeast, > 10 hours for Escherichia coli, which measures the total time taken for its vanishing after it has been synthesized in cell. The number of Carbon (C), Oxygen (O), Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Sulfur (S) of a total of 19710 atoms were formulated as C 6336 H 9770 N 1656 O 1984 S 54 .
