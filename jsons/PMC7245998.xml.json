Since the first laboratory-confirmed human infection with avian influenza A (H7N9) was reported on 31 March 2013, epidemics of human infections of H7N9 virus in mainland China have generally followed a seasonal trend, with five previous major outbreaks on record [1]. In the epidemic of the past 5 years, human cases of H7N9 have an annual peak in January and February, and the mortality rate was around 40% [2]. Among them, the epidemic situation was the worst in the 5th wave in 2017, and 766 laboratory-confirmed cases were observed (nearly half of the total number of H7N9 cases reported in 2013\u20132017 [3]). The seasonality of H7N9 epidemics implies that ambient temperature and absolute humidity had significant independent and interactive effects on H7N9 infection risks [4].",

One of the main ways people are exposed to the H7N9 virus is through exposure to live poultry markets (LPMs). Previous studies found that 80% of households reported purchasing poultry at LPMs at least once a year in 2006 [5], and 47% of residents in Guangzhou city reported visiting an LPMs > = 1 times a year in 2013. Retail and wholesale markets are two major types of LPMs in China. A prior study suggested that the retail but not the wholesale LPMs are strongly associated with human H7N9 infection risk [6, 7]. Given that there has been no evidence of H7N9 virus spread through human-to-human so far, the preventive measure should still focus on the human to animal [8]. In rural areas, 48% of respondents reported that they raised backyard poultry [9], while for cities the highest influenza A positive rates were detected at the retail LPMs [6].",

For instance, one strict prevention and control measures were used to conduct in Guangdong Province, which was daily cleaning of the market, weekly disinfection of the market and monthly closings of the live market. Some cities adopted a permanent closure of LPMs in recent years, such as in Shenzhen, and other cities have been taking the LPMs closed for a certain period in each year, like Shanghai and Guangzhou city. While for Hangzhou and Suzhou city implemented the closure only in urban area of cities. In short, the LPMs measures of closure are different when implemented in each city.",

In fact, most of the previously closed LPMs have reopened after the outbreak, due to the enormous economic and political pressures otherwise [16]. Hence, there is an urgent need for dissemination of the optimal available scientific evidence on the effectiveness of LPMs closure to help policymakers reassess intervention strategy in future human outbreaks of influenza A (H7N9). The paper aims to quantify the effect of LPMs closure on H7N9 infection after adjustment of climate variables in various cities and the role of LPMs closure of different scale and duration, to provide more empirical evidences for policy-makers for the efficient control of H7N9.",

The timelines for each city were derived by matching the calculated live poultry exposure dates of the cases with the start and end dates of the LPMs closure on the time axis.

In this daily time series, independent variables are divided into three categories: 1 \u2013 before LPMs closure, 2 \u2013 during or after LPMs all closure (all LPMs be closed in whole city), and 3 \u2013 during or after partial LPMs closure (only LPMs in urban be closed, suburban and rural area remain open); and the dependent variable was the number of cases on each day. Considering that LPMs in Suzhou and Hangzhou were partial closed i.e. only in urban area, we calculated the RR by merging the data according to the implemented or non-implemented area and date, to evaluate the effect of closure scale. Moreover, we controlled for the confounding effects of the current day\u2019s relative humidity, and the mean temperature.

The other two cities are located in Pearl River Delta: 1) Shenzhen, partially closed the LPMs in urban area during first 3 waves, the rest waves adopted the permanently all closure in the whole city till today; 2) Guangzhou, adopted partial LPMs closure in urban area during five waves. In summary, only Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen (latest 2 waves) implemented the LPMs all closure, Suzhou, Hangzhou and Shenzhen (first 3 waves) adopted the partial closure; comparing the all closure days in 5 waves we can find, Shanghai> Shenzhen> Guangzhou (Fig. 2). Timelines with exposure dates of each case, and days before during and after intervention in three cities (in different background color) were drawn respectively (Fig. 3), and the distribution of different periods lists in Table 1. Furthermore, general linear regression analysis shown a linear relationship in Shanghai between LPMs closure days (X) and epidemics interval days (Y) that is Y = 6.24X-224.37, R2 = 0.93, which indicated that longer the LPMs closure, later the next epidemic comes.\n",

But their study suggested that LPMs closure should be sustained in at-risk areas and implemented in any urban areas [8]. Our study\u2019s results of Hangzhou and Suzhou city indicated if only urban area implemented the LPMs closure would not be effective to reduce the risk for human H7N9 infected, may due to the people who have the habit of eating live poultry are still willing to the suburb or rural area to purchase the live poultry. In one investigated study [23] convincingly demonstrated this fact that all respondents were asked about, without consideration of other factors, which type of the chicken they preferred most among the four types of chicken (i.e. live, freshly slaughtered, chilled or frozen). A significant portion of 47% of respondents indicated that they preferred live chicken above other forms of chicken, while 32% expressed \u201cindifferent\u201d. Live poultry is a necessity for many residents and related workers, that may explain why partial closure does not cause have an ideal controlling consequent.

From a public health standpoint, LPMs should remain closed in all affected areas until the current influenza A (H7N9) epizootic and epidemic are declared definitively over by national authorities [8]. Moreover, one study suggested that A (H7N9) virus activity peaked around March in both retail and wholesale LPMs, while A (H5N1) virus peaked around in December to January in China [6].

One field study demonstrated that during the closure, H7N9 viral RNA detection and isolation rates in retail markets decreased by 79 and 92%, respectively. However, viable H7N9 virus could be cultured from wastewater samples collected up to 2 days after the market closure began [31]. Overall, LPMs reopen and temporary interventions cannot completely halt A (H7N9) virus persistence and dissemination. In order to balance the interests of agriculture economics [32] and public health, government encourages residence purchase chilled chicken instead of live poultry. Chilled chickens are slaughtered and packaged chicken stored at between 0 \u00b0C and 4 \u00b0C after going through a chilling process and has a shelf-life of 5\u20137 days, which can highly reduce the risk of virus transmission from live poultry to human [23]. Since the outbreaks of H7N9, many cities that reported the cases have launched a pilot program (named \u201cCentralized Slaughtering, Cold Chain Delivery, Chilled Poultry Supply\u201d) in designated areas, such as 2013 in Shanghai, 2014 in Guangzhou and Shenzhen [11]. Furthermore, the long-lasting circulation of the H7N9 virus in market poultry has often preceded the emergence of H7N9 outbreaks [14]. Based on the above considerations, on 1st June 2016, Shenzhen was the first city in China implemented the LPMs all closure in the whole city and sold chilled poultry instead of live poultry in urban and suburb areas. This policy of live poultry ban in the whole city can prevent any type of avian influenza not only H7N9. It is an optimal measure with long-term effectiveness to block the avian infected virus transmit to human, our results proved that as well.",

If we were able to collect the samples from the environment around the live poultry markets to detect the positive rate of virus of LPMs in every city, it can be a piece of strong evidence to support our results. Despite poultry immunity has been controlled, it does not rule out that the evolutionary genes transmit into human beings or emerge other types of avian influenza. It is necessary to adopt long-term, large-scale LPMs closure or even permanent ban on the sale of live poultry and wild animal in high-risk area and densely populated cities.",
