Impulse transmission along axons is greatly facilitated by the presence of myelin, the compact multilamellar extension of the plasma membrane of specialized glial cells that spirals around larger axons. In the central nervous system (CNS), oligodendroglial cells are responsible for the synthesis and maintenance of myelin, whereas Schwann cells subserve this role in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Schwann cells produce a single segment of myelin (called an internode), whereas oligodendroglial cells furnish multiple myelin segments around different axons, although only one segment for a given axon. There are periodic interruptions along the axons between adjacent myelin internodes; termed nodes of Ranvier, these short intervals where axons are not enveloped by myelin are vital for normal nervous system function (see later this chapter).",

In unmyelinated axons, impulse transmission involves a wave of membrane depolarization that moves down the axon in a continuous sequential manner. However, in myelinated axons, the myelin internodes function as high-resistance insulators, so the excitable axonal membrane, containing a high concentration of voltage-sensitive sodium channels, is exposed only at the nodes of Ranvier. Impulse conduction thus involves excitation at the nodes only, and the impulse jumps from node to node (saltatory conduction) (see Funch and Faber, 1984, Waxman, et al., 1989; and Morell et al., 1994, for details). Saltatory conduction is much 1 of the nervous system, facilitating conduction while conserving metabolic energy and space. It is not difficult to imagine how even minor loss of myelin or perturbations in its structure and/or function could have deleterious effects on normal nervous system function.",

            "text": "Structural aspects of the process of myelination are most easily illustrated in the PNS. Each myelin-forming Schwann cell produces an elaborate specialized extension of its plasma membrane, which is wrapped spirally around a segment of one axon (Fig. 1\n). Schwann cells, the glial cells of the PNS, are derived from the portion of the neural epithelium that gives rise to the neural crest (Le Douarin, 1982). During development, Schwann cells invade the developing nerves, where they migrate along bundles of axons, proliferate (probably in response to an axonal mitogen; Webster and Favilla, 1984), and segregate the axons individually within invaginations on the surface of Schwann cells. As they cease migrating, they synthesize a basal lamina (Billings-Gagliardi et al., 1974), composed of laminin, merosin, type IV collagen, fibronectin, nidogen/entactin, and heparan sulfate proteoglycan (Sanes and Cheney, 1982, Tohyama and Ide, 1984, Bannerman, et al., 1986, Leivo and Engvall, 1989, Sanes, et al., 1990). As the axons continue to enlarge, the larger axons become further segregated so that a single Schwann cell envelops a single axon. After the plasma membrane of the Schwann cell has completely enclosed the axon, the external surfaces of the plasma membrane fuse to form a structure known as the mesaxon. The mesaxon then elongates and spirals around the axon, eventually resulting in a \u201cjelly-roll\u201d structure consisting of double layers of the Schwann cell plasma membrane. Myelin internodes can be as much as 2 mm long and contain 5 mm of myelin spiral (Friede and Bischhausen, 1980). Myelin compaction occurs as cytoplasm is extruded and the cytoplasmic faces are condensed to produce the dark major period line visible in electron micrographs (Fig. 2\n). The juncture of what was originally the outer faces of the apposing plasma membranes form the lighter appearing intraperiod line. Mature myelin thus has a characteristic compact multilamellar structure, but cytoplasmic inclusions continuous with the perikarya cytoplasm of the Schwann cells are also present (Figs. 1 and 2). In addition, the myelin internode contains several ultrastructurally and biochemically distinct membrane domains, including the outer plasma membrane of the myelin-forming cell and the compact myelin itself, as well as the cytoplasm-containing Schmidt\u2013Lanterman incisures, paranodal loops, nodal microvilli, and outer and inner mesaxons. The latter cytoplasm-containing structures provide connections with the perikaryal cytoplasm, and are vital for myelin maintenance.",

Much of the local membrane assembly to give mature, compact myelin occurs within the oligodendroglial cytoplasmic processes (Waxman and Sims, 1984). The size of the fibers and the thickness of the sheaths are very different in the PNS and the CNS, but the overall surface area of myelin generated by an oligodendrocyte around multiple axons may be no larger than that formed by a Schwann cell around a single internode. The term oligodendrocyte, meaning \u201cfew processes,\u201d is actually somewhat of a misnomer, as a given oligodendrocyte may myelinate anywhere from less than five axons up to dozens of axons (Butt and Ransom, 1989, Bjartmar, et al., 1994). As in the PNS, the onset of myelination is preceded by proliferation of oligodendroglia. As development continues, both the diameter and length of the axons increase, and this is associated with a corresponding increase in nodal length as well as increases in myelin thickness. Thus, despite its compact highly ordered appearance, myelin continues to expand in all planes during growth and development.",

There is, however, considerable overlap in this progression. In addition, each fiber tract may have its own spatiotemporal pattern of myelination, so that the degree of myelination may differ in different fiber tracts at a given developmental stage. For example, myelination in the spinal cord proceeds in a rostral\u2013caudal gradient, whereas in the optic nerve, myelination progresses with a retinal to chiasmal gradient. Although not necessarily an absolute prerequisite for function, in general, fiber tracts are myelinated before they become fully functional.",

In both the CNS and PNS, an enormous amount of myelin membrane is formed (some PNS axons may have as many as 100 layers) and this membrane must be maintained at a considerable distance from the supporting glial cell body. The surface area of myelin per adult oligodendrocyte in the rat brain has been calculated to be 1\u201320 \u00d7 105\n \n\u03bcm2, several orders of magnitude greater than the perikaryal membrane surface area of about 100 \n\u03bcm2 (Pfeiffer et al., 1993). Myelinating glial cells are thus maximally stressed in terms of their metabolic and synthetic capacity during this time, with each cell synthesizing myelin equivalent to up to 3 times the weight of its perikarya each day (Morell et al., 1994). Because of these very high levels of synthetic and metabolic activity, these myelinating cells are especially vulnerable to nutritional deficits and/ or to toxic insults or injuries during this period.",

During the early stages of myelination, the axon is loosely ensheathed by processes arising from immature, relatively undifferentiated glial cells. Loose glial ensheathment of axons in the optic nerve is seen in the rat beginning at postnatal day 6. This is followed by spiral wrapping of the axon by oligodendroglial processes that form compact myelin. In some tracts, the immature myelin sheath is initially close to the oligodendroglial cell body (Remahl and Hildebrand, 1990), but with maturation the sheath is displaced radially and often is connected to the cell body by only a thin cytoplasmic bridge. A single oligodendrocyte can myelinate axons of various diameters in their vicinity and can form myelin sheaths of different thicknesses around axons of differing diameter.",

Myelin internodal distance is also matched to fiber diameter (Hess and Young, 1952) and the internodal distance: diameter ratio is different for fibers in different tracts. There is some evidence that myelination is initiated when a developing axon reaches a \u201ccritical diameter.\u201d However, myelination occurs over a range of axonal diameters (Fraher, 1972) and at various times along a single axon (Waxman, et al., 1972, Waxman, 1985).

Although some Schwann cells go on to myelinate axons, others only ensheath bundles of unmyelinated axons. These nonmyelinated Schwann cells express distinct molecular markers such as the low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (NGF-R), neural cell adhesion molecules (N-CAM and L1), and growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43), but none of the myelin specific proteins (see following sections, as well as Mirsky and Jessen, 1990; Curtis et al., 1992). Transplantation studies have shown that the axon determines the phenotype of the Schwann cell (Aguayo, et al., 1976, Weinberg and Spencer, 1976). Thus, there are a number of potentially distinct physical interactions between Schwann cells and axons as Schwann cells proliferate, migrate, ensheath axons, and form myelin sheaths during development of the PNS.",

The premyelinated axon is electrically excitable (Foster et al., 1982; Waxman et al., 1989) and the loss of excitability in the internodal axonal membrane that occurs with myelination involves an active suppression of Na+ channels by the overlying oligodendrocyte or myelin sheath (Black, et al., 1985, Black, et al., 1986). Proliferation of oligodendrocyte precursors in the optic nerve is dependent on axonal electrical activity in that the blockage of optic nerve electrical activity by transection or exposure to tetrodotoxin resulted in a dramatic loss of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (Barres and Raff, 1993). Potassium channels may also participate in myelin formation; the potassium channel blocker, TEA+ was shown to be effective in eliminating myelination in spinal cord explants while leaving axonal conduction and synapse formation intact.",

Most of our knowledge derives from cell-culture studies, but in vivo developmental studies in normal as well as in transgenic and gene knock-out mice have also proved useful. Understanding of the events and stages involved is of potential clinical relevance, not only with respect to various toxic neuropathies and to PNS nerve regeneration, but also because Schwann cell precursors may be attractive candidates for transplantation to facilitate remyelination and repair in injured CNS. A detailed discussion of this subject is beyond the scope of this chapter, but the reader is referred to several comprehensive reviews on this subject if more details are desired (Jessen and Mirsky, 1991, Gould, et al., 1992, Mirsky and Jessen, 1996, Zorick and Lemke, 1996). Schwann cells develop from neural crest cells and most of the key developmental stages in Schwann cell maturation seem to depend on axon-associated signals. Schwann cell precursors give rise to immature Schwann cells, which have a distinct phenotype (Fig. 4A\n). These cells then develop into either myelin-forming Schwann cells, under the control of reversible processes regulated by axon-associated signals. Even mature Schwann cells show a high degree of plasticity. Following a demyelinating insult, Schwann cells dedifferentiate into more primitive precursor cells, but generally do not die. When appropriate conditions present themselves (such as the regrowth of axons that occurs following a nerve-crush injury), these cells can proliferate, reestablish contact with axons, redifferentiate to the myelin-forming phenotype, and remyelinate the axons, thereby restoring normal function.",

Members of the NDF growth factor family, including glial growth factor (GGF), heregulin, acetylcholine-inducing activity (ARIA), and neuregulin, are alternatively spliced products of a single gene, and these molecules are emerging as important regulators of Schwann cell lineage development (Dong, et al., 1995, Zorick and Lemke, 1996).

Their development is discussed only briefly here, but a more comprehensive review is available (Warrington and Pfeiffer, 1992). Panels of cell- and stage-specific antibodies have proved especially useful in characterizing the sequential expression of various developmental markers, and this has allowed identification of distinct phenotypic stages, each characterized by its proliferative capacity, migratory ability, and distinct morphologies. Primitive precursor cells differentiate into proliferative, migratory bipolar O2A progenitor cells. These cells are bipotential, being capable of differentiating into either astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. The oligodendrocyte lineage progresses through several additional stages, including an immature oligodendrocyte expressing galactocerebroside, sulfatide, and cyclic nucleotide phosphordiesterase (all myelin components), finally arriving several days later at the mature oligodendrocyte stage. Mature oligodendrocytes express all of the myelin-specific proteins and are capable of myelin synthesis in vitro in the absence of axons.",

In addition, a small population of oligodendrocyte progenitors persist in the adult rat brain (see Wolswijk and Noble, 1995, for details), and these constitute a potential source of myelin-forming cells for CNS remyelination. Immature, cycling oligodendroglial progenitor cells endogenous to adult white matter are capable of remyelinating CNS axons following lysolecithin-induced demyelination (Gensert and Goldman, 1997). Also, O2-A progenitor cells from mice subjected to coronavirus-induced demyelination show increased phenotypic plasticity and enhanced mitotic potential, properties that may be linked to the efficient remyelination that occurs following the demyelinating phase of this disease (Armstrong et al., 1990). Manipulation of these progenitor cells by various factors (see later this chapter) thus may also be useful in promoting remyelination in a clinical context.",

Oligodendrocytes differ from Schwann cells in that they can be induced to produce myelin in culture in the absence of axons. This raises the question of the extent to which neurons and their axons influence oligodendrocytes with respect to development and myelination in vivo. It is, however, difficult to imagine the lack of significant interaction between these two cells in the developing nervous system, and in fact, many such interactions are known. Neurons produce many of the growth factors involved, and they are known to modulate steady-state levels of myelin components as well as mRNA levels for these components (Singh and Pfeiffer, 1985, Macklin, et al., 1986; Kidd et al., 1990; Barres and Raff, 1993,).",

The marked up-regulation of myelin-specific proteins, as well as of enzymes involved in synthesis of myelin lipids (see later this chapter), reflects corresponding increases in abundance of the respective mRNA transcripts, suggesting that most regulation of the program for myelination occurs at the level of transcription (see Hudson, 1990, for review). A possible candidate for the coordinate control of CNS myelination is myelin transcription factor 1 (MyTI), a zinc-finger DNA-binding protein first identified by its ability to recognize the myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) gene (Kim and Hudson, 1992). MyTI mRNA transcripts are most abundant in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, suggesting that this factor acts at a very early stage in the regulation of transcription for myelinogenesis (Armstrong et al., 1995).",

This complexity of gene expression is augmented by posttranslational protein modifications, including loss of C-terminal arginine, N-acylation, glycosylation, phosphorylation, methylation, deamination, and substitution of some arginine residues with citrulline (Toews and Morell, 1987, Smith, 1992, Morell, et al., 1994). MBPs are extrinsic membrane proteins localized to the cytoplasmic membrane surface (major dense line) of myelin of both the CNS and PNS. In the CNS this protein accounts for approximately 30% of the total myelin protein, whereas in the PNS it accounts for only 18% (Greenfield et al., 1980). Myelin lipids can promote MBP self-association, suggesting it may exist as oligomers on the cytoplasmic surface of the myelin membrane (Smith, 1992). It has been suggested that stabilization and maintenance of the myelin structure may be due to specific associations between MBPs and sulfatides and gangliosides (Ong and Yu, 1984, Maggio and Yu, 1989, Maggio and Yu, 1992, Mendz, 1992, Smith, 1992).",

PLP is the most abundant protein in CNS myelin (50%), and although mRNA for this protein is present in the PNS, the protein itself is present at only very low levels in PNS myelin (Lemke, 1992) and its function in PNS myelin is unknown (Puckett, et al., 1987, Kamholz, et al., 1992). A report (Garbern et al., 1997) of a human PLP null mutation phenotype characterized by a demyelinating peripheral neuropathy suggests that PLP/DM20 is necessary for proper myelin formation in the PNS as well as the CNS. This report also demonstrates by immunoelectron microscopy the presence of PLP in compact PNS myelin (however, see also Puckett et al., 1987). Like MBP, PLP is one of the products of alternative splicing of a single gene, having a molecular weight of approximately 25 kDa. DM20, a second isoform that migrates as a 20 kDa band on SDS gel electrophoresis, is identical to PLP except for the deletion of amino acid residues 116\u2013150 (Macklin, 1992). The PLP\u2013DM20 gene, located on chromosome X in the mouse, rat, and human, is approximately 17 kb in length and consists of seven exons. The alternative splicing of this gene to give PLP and/or DM20 is developmentally regulated, with the DM20 splice product predominating during early myelination. Some mutations of the PLP/DM20 gene (e.g., jimpy mice; see later this chapter) result in developmental abnormalities prior to any myelination, suggesting that gene may be involved in other functions besides myelination. In addition, expression is not confined to myelin-producing oligodendrocytes in the CNS. The role of protein products of this gene outside the nervous system remain unknown, however. Missense mutations of the PLP/DM20 gene give rise to a host of CNS pathologies, the most devastating being Pelizaeus\u2013Merzbacher disease (PMD) (see Seitelberger, 1995). In some forms of PMD, there is complete deletion of the PLP/DM20 gene (Raskind et al., 1991). The described single base pair deletion in humans leads to the absence of PLP/DM20 expression; this produces a disease similar to, but less severe than, classic PMD, but also involving a progressive demyelinating peripheral neuropathy (Garbern et al., 1997).",

In addition, PLP may play an active role as an ion channel (Toews and Morell, 1987, Lees and Bizzozero, 1992). As noted previously, DM20 is generally a relatively minor product of the PLP gene but it shows a pattern of developmental regulation distinct from PLP. It is expressed earlier in development than PLP and is the major PLP gene product in the developing embryo (Ikenaka, et al., 1992, Macklin, 1992, Timsit, et al., 1992).

            "text": "Myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) is the principal glycoprotein of central nervous system myelin (for review, see Milner, et al., 1990, Quarles, et al., 1992). MAG is heavily glycosylated and is specific to myelin sheaths, with an especially high concentration in the periaxonal regions of both CNS and PNS myelin. It is a member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily (Sutcliffe, et al., 1983, Lai, et al., 1987, Salzer, et al., 1987). Examination of the extracellular, N-terminal domains suggest that MAG is most closely related to the cell adhesion molecules N-CAM, L1, and contactin. In the PNS, MAG immunostaining is seen in glial membranes of the Schmidt-Lantermann incisures, paranodal loops, and mesaxons (Trapp, 1990) and is distinctly absent from the compact myelin sheath. It is thought that MAG plays a major role in membrane\u2013membrane interactions during myelin formation and maintenance (Salzer, et al., 1990, Quarles, et al., 1992, Morell, et al., 1994). It is presumed to be involved in the adhesion of the myelin sheath to the axonal plasmalemma and in membrane spacing (Trapp, 1990), and it has been implicated in various peripheral neuropathies (Mendell, et al., 1985, Tatum, 1993). MAG exists as two isoforms (L-MAG and S-MAG) that are derived by alternative splicing from a single gene. L-MAG is produced almost exclusively in the CNS and is the predominant variant during early development and active myelination (Campagnoni, 1988, Trapp, 1990). S-MAG is the major isoform in the adult CNS and in the PNS at all ages. It is thought that the differences in distribution within the CNS and PNS may be associated with either the phosphorylation or other posttranslational modifications (e.g., sulfation of oligosaccharide moieties, acylation of the transmembrane domain) altering interactions with the cytoskele-ton (Trapp, 1990, Quarles, et al., 1992). Homotypic interaction may be operational in Schmidt\u2013Lantermann incisures, paranodal loops, and mesaxon membranes in PNS myelin, whereas heterotypic interactions with axolemmal constituents may mediate glia\u2013axon adhesion (Salzer, et al., 1990, Trapp, 1990, Quarles, et al., 1992).",

Because no physiologically relevant substrate molecules have been found in myelin, however, this enzymatic activity may actually be vestigial and unrelated to its function in myelin. The current view of CNP is that it may be a key component of an interactive protein network within oligodendroglial cells, possibly involved in extension of processes (e.g., see Braun et al., 1990). It is isoprenylated, suggesting possible involvement in signal transduction processes (Braun et al., 1991). Furthermore, the presence of potential nucleotide-binding domains on CNP (Sprinkle, 1989) suggest it might exert regulatory influence on various cellular processes such as growth and differentiation by serving as a link between extracellular signals and intracellular effector molecules. Its exact function within myelin and oligodendroglial cells, however, remains unknown.",

This has lead to the suggestion that P0 is the PNS equivalent of PLP in the CNS, although the properties of these two proteins are very different. P0 is a transmembrane protein with a glycosylated extracellular domain, a single membrane spanning region, and a highly basic intracellular domain (Lemke,(Lemke and Axel, 1985). It is thought to play an important role in the compaction of myelin through the homotypic interaction of molecules on adjacent myelin lamellae (Lemke, 1988). Like MAG, it is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Unlike many of the other myelin protein genes, expression of the P0 gene is highly restricted to Schwann cells. The P0 gene contains six exons distributed over about 7 kb in both rats and mice (Lemke, 1988, You, et al., 1991). Based on transgenic experiments, elements regulating its expression appear to reside in first 1.1 kb of the 5\u2032-flanking region (Messing et al., 1992). Mutation of the P0 gene in humans is associated with Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease, type 1B, an inherited peripheral neuropathy (Hayasaka, et al., 1993, Kulkens, et al., 1993).",

Interest in P2 arose from its ability to induce experimental allergic neuritis, a demyelinating disease of the PNS (Kadlubowski and Hughes, 1980). It has sequence homology to cellular retinol and retinoic acid\u2013binding proteins (Crabb and Saari, 1981, Eriksson, et al., 1981) and fatty acid\u2013binding proteins (FABPs) (Veer-kamp et al., 1991), and has high affinity for oleic acid, retinoic acid, and retinol (Uyemura et al., 1984). The P2 protein gene belongs to an ancient family of FABPs that diverged into two major subfamilies (Medzihradszky et al., 1992). P2 mRNA levels parallel myelination during development as well as the levels of microsomal enzymes involved in fatty acid elongation. This suggests the P2 protein may be involved in fatty acid elongation or in the transport of very long-chain fatty acids to myelin (Narayanan et al., 1988).",

The rat and human genes have been cloned (Spreyer, et al., 1991, Welcher, et al., 1991, Hayasaka, et al., 1992); although these have a high homology to the growth arrest\u2013specific mRNAs for gas 3 and PASII-glycoprotein, the function of PMP-22 in PNS myelin remains unknown. The PMP-22 gene maps to mouse chromosome 11 and a point mutation in this gene is apparently responsible for the autosomal dominant mutation in the Trembler (Tr) mutant mouse (Suter, et al., 1992a, Suter, et al., 1992b). In humans, the gene maps to chromosome 17; this gene is duplicated in patients with Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease, type 1A, and this alteration is presumably related to the pathology (Patel, et al., 1992, Valentijn, et al., 1992; see Campagnoni, 1995, and Newman et al., 1995 for additional references and discussion). The rat PMP-22 gene, the expression of which is largely confined to the PNS, is developmentally regulated in Schwann cells, where its expression coincides with myelination (Spreyer, et al., 1991, Snipes, et al., 1992). mRNA expression is coordinately down-regulated along with other myelin proteins during tellurium-induced primary demyelination and during degeneration induced by nerve transection or crush; message levels are consequently up-regulated along with other myelin genes during remyelination if it occurs (Spreyer, et al., 1991, Toews, et al., 1997).",

            "text": "Although myelin initially was believed to be metabolically inert (due largely to the very slow metabolic turnover of some of its components) and to function exclusively as an electrical insulator, it is now known that the picture is considerably more complex and interesting. All protein and lipid components of myelin turn over with measurable turnover rates (see Benjamins and Smith, 1984, Morell, et al., 1994). Although some structural components of myelin are indeed relatively stable metabolically, with half-lives of several months, there is also a very rapid turnover of some myelin components. The phosphate groups modifying myelin basic protein in compact CNS myelin turn over with half-lives of minutes or less (DesJardins and Morell, 1983), and the phosphate groups on myelin polyphosphoinositides also show a very rapid turnover rate. At least 40 different enzyme activities have been documented in CNS myelin (Newman et al., 1995). In addition to CNP described previously, these include enzymes related to second messenger signalling, as well as associated receptors and G-proteins (Larocca et al., 1990). A number of enzymes involved in myelin lipid metabolism are also present, including those for phospholipid synthesis and catabolism. Noteworthy among the latter are phospholipase C activities for polyphosphoinositides, and these may have important roles in signal transduction mechanisms in myelin (Ledeen, 1992). Also of note are a cholesterol ester hydrolase, and UDP-galactose: ceramide galactosyltransferase, the terminal enzyme in biosynthesis of galactocerebroside, the most \u201cmyelin-specific\u201d lipid. Various proteases, protein kinases and phosphatases, and transport-related enzymes are also present; of particular interest with respect to the transport-related enzymes are carbonic anhydrase (Cammer et al., 1976) and Na+,K+-ATPase (Zimmerman and Cammer, 1982). These enzymes may be involved in controlling K+ levels at nodes of Ranvier (Lees and Sapirstein, 1983) and/or in removal of carbonic acid from metabolically active axons.",

There is indeed a great deal of protein and lipid transport and targeting within the myelinating glial cell, and cytoskeletal elements play important roles in these processes. P0, MAG, and laminin (a secreted extracellular matrix component; Cornbrooks et al., 1983) are synthesized and modified in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and Golgi membranes of the perinuclear cytoplasm and then sorted into different carrier vesicles upon exit from the trans Golgi network (Trapp et al., 1993). These proteins must be transported over millimeter distances prior to insertion into their proper surface membrane locations. Various proteins enriched in compact myelin reach their proper destinations via different mechanisms. For example, P0 reaches compact myelin by vesicular transport, whereas it is the mRNA for MBP that is translocated, with synthesis of MBP occurring close to the site of its insertion into the forming myelin (Colman, et al., 1982, Trapp, et al., 1987, Griffiths, et al., 1989).",

            "text": "As noted previously, the cytoskeleton plays a major role in transport and assembly of myelin. In myelinating Schwann cells, microfilaments are enriched beneath the membranes of the Schmidt\u2013Lanterman incisures, the outer and inner mesaxons, and portions of the outermost compact myelin lamellae and Schwann cell plasma membrane (Trapp, et al., 1989, Zimmerman and Vogt, 1989, Kordeli, et al., 1990). It is thought that interactions between MAG and microfilaments play a role in membrane motility during myelination (Trapp and Quarles, 1982, Trapp, et al., 1984, Martini and Schachner, 1986, Salzer, et al., 1987). MAG colocalizes with microfilaments at membranes that move during internodal growth (Trapp et al., 1989). A role for MAG in myelin wrapping and spacing is supported by studies showing precocious spiral wrapping by myelinating Schwann cells transfected with additional copies of MAG (Owens et al., 1990), and impaired or prevented wrapping when MAG expression is reduced or eliminated in Schwann cells (Owens and Bunge, 1991, Mendell, et al., 1985). Microfilaments also help to define and maintain organelle-rich channel regions and organelle-free non-channel regions of the myelin internode. The channel regions are important to formation and maintenance of the myelin internode and to intracellular transport of myelin components. They include the external cytoplasmic channels, Schmidt\u2013Lanterman incisures, para nodal loops, and periaxonal cytoplasm. Microfilaments associated with the abaxonal plasma membrane and the adaxonal periaxonal membrane may have multiple functions in dealing with the external environment, including endocytosis (Blok et al., 1982), pinocytosis (Phaire-Washington et al., 1980), and exocytosis (John, et al., 1983, Koffer, et al., 1990), as well as stress resistance.",

Post-Golgi vesicles transported in this way could be involved in the growth, turnover, or modification of compact myelin at distant sites. Microtubules are the largest of the cytoskeletal filaments and provide a dynamic substrate for organelle trafficking and structural organization (for review see Dustin, 1984, Kirschner and Mitchison, 1986, Schroer and Sheetz, 1991). They are present in all major cytoplasmic compartments of the myelin internode, but are excluded from compact myelin (Peters et al., 1991). In myelinating Schwann cells, microtubules are crucial to the transport of myelin proteins and organelles (Trapp et al., 1995). This function is determined by the orientation and organization of microtubules, which in turn are influenced by axons (Kidd et al., 1994). During the formation of the myelin sheath, contact with a myelin-inducing axon results in a more complex microtubule organization (Kidd et al., 1994). As in axons, microtubules are inherently unstable and oscillate between phases of elongation and collapse (Dustin, 1984, Kirschner and Mitchison, 1986). The extent of depolymerization and repolymerization is determined by complex assembly/disassembly kinetics and can be influenced by modifications such as binding of MAPs (Sloboda, et al., 1976, Pryer, et al., 1992). Microtubule disassembly causes marked accumulation of P0, MAG, and laminin in the perinuclear cytoplasm of myelinating Schwann cells (Trapp et al., 1995). Because of this, chemically induced neurotoxicity involving microtubules may lead to alterations not only in axons, but also in myelin and myelinating cells as well.",

            "text": "Because the structure and composition of myelin is unique, its formation involves activation of a set of unique genes (see Lemke, 1988, for details). These genes include those related to induction of myelination (e.g., glial-specific receptors for differentiation signals), those involved in controlling and directing the initial deposition of myelin (e.g., axon\u2013glial cell-adhesion molecules), and those involved in actual production of compact myelin (e.g., structural proteins of myelin). Genes for enzymes involved in synthesis of lipids enriched in myelin are also preferentially activated as well. The process of myelination is a highly regulated event that begins postnatally during the first few weeks of life in the rodent brain and within the third fetal trimester in the human spinal cord. In the CNS of rodents, maximum levels of synthesis of myelin components and actual accumulation of myelin occurs at about 3 weeks of age (Norton and Poduslo, 1973b, Norton and Cammer, 1984, Morell, et al., 1994), and although myelin accumulation continues for an extended time, the rate of synthesis declines considerably by about 6 weeks of age. This time course is similar to the profile of expression of myelin protein genes (see Campagnoni and Macklin, 1988). In the rodent PNS, myelination begins at about birth, peaks at about 2 weeks, and then decreases to a low basal level by the end of the first month (Webster, 1971). As is the case in the CNS, the pattern of myelin synthesis and accumulation is closely paralleled by expression of mRNA for PNS myelin protein components (Lemke and Axel, 1985, Stahl, et al., 1990) and for enzymes involved in synthesis of major myelin lipids (hydroxymethylglutaryl-Coenzyme A [HMG-CoA] reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis; and ceramide galactosyltransferase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cerebroside biosynthesis) (Lemke and Axel, 1985). Regulation of the expression of myelin genes occurs at a number of different levels including promotor choice, transcription, mRNA splicing and stability, translation, and posttranslational processing (for reviews see Campagnoni, 1988, Campagnoni and Macklin, 1988, Lemke, 1988, Nave and Milner, 1989; Ikenaka et al., 1991; Mikoshiba, et al., 1991, Campagnoni, 1995).",

After individual myelin components have been synthesized, they must be assembled to form mature compact myelin. Some components, such as PLP, which is synthesized on bound polyribosomes in the oligodendroglial perikaryon, show a time lag of about 45 min between their synthesis and their appearance in myelin, reflecting the time required for transport from their site of synthesis to the forming myelin. Other components, such as MBP, show only a short lag, in keeping with their synthesis of free polyribosomes in oligodendroglial processes, near the actual site of myelin assembly. In keeping with this difference, studies have shown that myelinating cells spatially segregate mRNA species for myelin-specific proteins (see Trapp et al., 1987). mRNA for MBP is transported to near the sites of myelin assembly before the protein is synthesized (Trapp, et al., 1988, Gillespie, et al., 1990), whereas PLP mRNA is present in a perinuclear location. Individual lipids also show different kinetics of entry into myelin following synthesis, and some of this may be due to synthesis in, or movement through, different intracellular pools (Benjamins, et al., 1976, Benjamins and Iwata, 1979; for review, see Benjamins and Smith, 1984).",

Some of these membrane domains are compositionally distinct, containing different structural proteins and differing in lipid composition as well. With respect to the PNS, P0, MBP, and PMP-22 are enriched in compact PNS myelin (Trapp, et al., 1981, Omlin, et al., 1982), whereas PLP and MBP predominate in compact CNS myelin. The exact mechanisms by which individual components are targeted to their respective membrane domains and other molecular aspects of actual myelin membrane assembly are not well understood, but this continues to be an active area of investigation.

The behavioral phenotype of this mouse is first observed within the second postnatal week, when a general body tremor, which becomes more pronounced with intentional movements, develops (Biddle et al., 1973; Chernoff, 1981). The shivering behavior derives from a loss of spinal motor and reflex control and increases with age, often progressing to include seizures.

At the ultrastructural level, the pattern of dysmyelination is dominated by a severe lack of myelin. The myelin-like structures that are occasionally present are loosely wrapped around the axon and the intracellular adhesion zone of the extended cell process that normally forms the \u201cmajor dense line\u201d of myelin cannot be discerned (Readhead and Hood, 1990). The lack of proper myelin sheath formation may be the result of a defect in myelin compaction or a related process, because oligodendroglia appear to be normally differentiated. Histologic evidence of dysmyelination is supported biochemically by a dramatic reduction of all major myelin proteins, and more specifically by the complete lack of MBP. This is the result of a large (20 kb) genomic deletion encompassing exons 3\u20137 of the MBP gene (or exons 7\u201311 of the larger golli-MBP gene) resulting in no coding capacity for any of the MBP isoforms (Roach, et al., 1985, Molineaux, et al., 1986).",

Similarly, the formation of antisense MBP mRNA is the presumed primary defect of the myelin-deficient (shi-mld) mouse mutant, an allele of the shiverer mutation on chromosome 18 (Doolittle and Schweikart, 1977, Popko, et al., 1988). The presence of this antisense RNA is thought to reduce and dysregulate the amount of normal MBP mRNA functionally available, thereby resulting in a level insufficient for normal myelin formation (Fremeau and Popko, 1990, Tosic, et al., 1990). The dysmyelination is less severe in the myelin deficient mouse when compared to the shiverer mouse. Isolated white matter tracts in CNS have a 3\u20134-fold increase in sodium channel density and it has been suggested that some myelin-associated molecule absent from the Shiverer white matter tracts could cause a down-regulation of either the synthesis or accumulation of sodium channels in myelinating axons (Noebels et al., 1991). The lack of dysmyelination in the PNS is thought to be due to the substitution of P0, the major integral protein of PNS myelin, for the structural function of MBP (Lemke and Axel, 1985).",

In the mouse, three mutations have been characterized: the jimpy (jp), myelin synthesis\u2013deficient (jp msd), and rumpshaker (rsh). Each derives from a point mutation that alters the structure of the encoded protein. In the jimpy mouse, the mutation is a single nucleotide change in the PLP gene that inactivates the splice-acceptor site of intron 4. The last \u03b1-helical transmembrane domain is replaced by an aberrant carboxy terminus, and the resulting abnormally folded protein is degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum shortly after synthesis, failing to reach the Golgi apparatus for further processing and transport (Roussel et al., 1987). The CNS is nearly completely devoid of myelin, with less than 1% of the axons ensheathed; PNS myelin, however, is ultrastructurally intact (Sidman, 1964, Herschkowitz, et al., 1971). There are only a few layers of abnormally thin myelin around CNS myelin, consisting of either uncompacted membrane whorls or compacted myelin with abnormal ultrastructure (Duncan et al., 1989). The major cause of the dysmyelination in the jimpy mouse seems to be a lack of differentiated oligodendrocytes. The proliferation rate of oligodendrocyte precursor cells is increased but an abnormally high rate of apoptotic cell death eliminates most of these maturating oligodendrocytes (Skoff, 1982, Knapp, et al., 1986, Barres, et al., 1992). Islands of myelinated fibers are formed by the few oligodendrocytes that escape degeneration and developmental arrest. The behavioral phenotype is evident at 2 weeks of age and consists of general body tremor and ataxia; the animals die with seizures and convulsions by about 4 weeks of age. Heterozygous jimpy females, which are mosaics with respect to the X-linked PLP gene, display normal behavior.",

The rumpshaker mutant is the result of a novel mutation of the PLP gene (Schneider et al., 1992) and displays a phenotype very different from the jimpy and the jimpy msd. Rumpshaker mice have more myelin than other dysmyelinated mutants and the degree of dysmyelination varies among CNS regions, with early myelinated regions appearing normal whereas late myelinating regions are severely hypomyelinated. The oligodendrocytes appear differentiated and most escape apoptotic cell death resulting in a normal complement of mature oligodendrocytes (Griffiths et al., 1990). The rumpshaker mutation appears to allow the oligodendrocyte to survive but somehow interferes with its ability to normally deposit PLP in the myelin membrane (Schneider et al., 1992). Although sparse, some myelin sheaths subsist in the rumpshaker mutants and these show selective immunostaining for DM20 (Schneider et al., 1992). These findings suggest that DM20 may serve a critical purpose in glial cell development that is distinct from any function in myelin formation and maintenance.",

Animals lacking one functional copy of the P0 gene are phenotypically normal, but the homozygotes develop a behavioral phenotype by the third week of life. These mice show a body tremor and dragging movements of the hindlimbs. There is no evidence of paralysis or seizures and the mutants have a normal life span. Histologically, the deficit is characterized by the inability of the Schwann cell to assemble a compacted multilamellar PNS myelin sheath. The high degree of variability in the pathology is thought to be due to the intervening actions of other proteins such as cell adhesion molecules (MAG; N-CAM), and perhaps other myelin proteins. Using promoter and regulatory regions of the P0 gene in a fusion gene construct, Schwann cells were destroyed when they began to express P0, after associating in a 1:1 ratio with axons (Messing et al., 1992). The behavioral phenotype of the Schwann cell\u2013ablated mice was similar to the phenotype displayed in the homogygous P0 mutants.

Histologically, the majority of large caliber axons in the sciatic nerve are devoid of a myelin sheath and, if present at all, these are abnormally thin and relatively uncompacted (Henry and Sidman, 1988). The total number of Schwann cells is dramatically increased at the time of segregation of axons, and myelin deposition is arrested.

The production of neurons is virtually completed by about the midpoint of gestation, but glial cell production continues through the end of gestation into the second postnatal year. The vulnerability of the developing nervous system to various factors is determined by the developmental stage of the cellular activities targeted by a specific insult. The effects of an agent or condition may vary depending on the agent, the time of insult during development, and the species under study (Dobbing, et al., 1971). General factors such as undernutrition can have maximal effects on processes that are most active during what has been called the \u201cbrain growth spurt\u201d (Dobbing and Sands, 1979). Depending on the developmental process ongoing at the time of exposure, alterations can be produced in either the number of neurons and extent of axonal arborizations, the number of glial cells, or the degree of myelination.",

Brains of rats undernourished from birth contain a lower amount (20% deficit) of total lipids, cholesterol, and phospholipids and a 50% deficit in cerebrosides (Benton et al., 1966). Following severe nutritional deprivation during lactation and post-weaning, total brain galactolipids, cholesterol, and lipid phosphorus showed a slower rate of accumulation (Krigman and Hogan, 1976). Lipid phosphorus and cholesterol levels recovered by adulthood, whereas galactolipids remained at a 60% decreased level. Myelin recovered from undernourished rats was normal in lipid composition but siginificantly reduced in total amount (Fishman et al., 1971). A reduced proportion of basic and proteolipid protein was seen in myelin isolated from undernourished rats at postnatal days 15 and 20, but the composition was similar to normals by postnatal day 30. At all time points examined, myelin yield was 25% less than normal levels (Wiggins et al., 1976). These studies suggested that undernutrition produced a delay in myelin maturation. Morphologic examination of animals undernourished from birth showed a decreased number of mature oligodendroglia and poorly stained myelin (Bass, et al., 1970, Krigman and Hogan, 1976). The number of myelin lamellae per axon and the number of myelin lamellae for a given axon diameter were both lower (Krigman and Hogan, 1976).",

Rats deprived by an increased litter size rapidly gained body and brain weight and normal brain lipid composition within 3 weeks after weaning to an unrestricted diet (Benton et al., 1966). However, nutritional deprivation during the first 21 days of life resulted in reduced levels of total brain lipids, cerebrosides, cholesterol, and PLP, and this deficit persisted through 120 days of age (Bass et al., 1970). Similar persistent myelin deficits were found in brains of rats subjected to either moderate or severe food deprivation during the first 30 days of life (Toews et al., 1983). Although metabolic studies showed that after 6 days of free feeding following 20 days of postnatal starvation, incorporation of labeled precursors into myelin proteins was higher than in animals starved for the entire 26 days, and it was still depressed relative to controls (Wiggins et al., 1976). Severe underfeeding in rats from 1 to 14 days of age resulted in a lasting significant deficit in myelin, even with rehabilitation (Wiggins and Fuller, 1978). Overall, these studies point to the possibility of irreversible deficits in myelin resulting from nutritional deficiencies during development. Additional studies suggest the most vulnerable period for myelin may be the time of oligodendroglial proliferation. Animals deprived during this period are left with a permanent deficit of myelin-forming cells, resulting in irreversible hypomyelination (Wiggins and Fuller, 1978). Apparently, once normal numbers of oligodendroglia have been formed, the process of myelin formation itself is somewhat more capable of nutritional rehabilitation.",

An early postnatal protein deficiency resulted in reduced levels of brain myelin and an altered myelin composition in rats (Nakhasi et al., 1975). In myelin from offspring of rats maintained on a 4% protein diet during lactation, an excess of high molecular weight proteins and a deficiency of PLP in heavy myelin was found at postnatal day 17, with normal protein composition seen at 53 days (Figlewicz et al., 1978). The MAG persisted in its higher molecular weight form longer than normal, suggesting that protein deficiency results in a delay in development and maturation of the myelination process (Druse and Krett, 1979).",

            "text": "A classic example of differential susceptibility of the developing organism to the effects of an environmental chemical is that of inorganic lead exposure. Children are more vulnerable to lead in terms of external exposure sources, internal levels of lead, and timing of exposures during development. At high exposure levels, lead induces encephalopathy in children and can be life threatening. Experimental animal studies have allowed examination of various specific target sites and processes of development susceptible to lead toxicity (Krigman et al., 1980). During development, the process of CNS myelination shows an increased vulnerability to lead exposure. The amount of lead that accumulates in the brain of the developing animal during lactation can be as much as 4 times higher than brain levels in the lactating dam receiving lead in the drinking water. Under these conditions, myelin was significantly reduced; however, the relationship between the axon diameter and myelin lamellae remained normal, suggesting that the hypomyelination was the result of altered axonal growth (Krigman et al., 1974). Direct administration of lead via to pups intubation from 2 to 30 days of age resulted in a reduction of myelin accumulation in the forebrain and optic nerve. These effects were not due to undernutrition, as the accumulation of brain myelin was decreased significantly relative to controls undergoing a similar degree of malnourishment (Toews et al., 1980). In developing rats, there is a synergistic interaction between lead exposure and mild malnutrution induced by milk deprivation with respect to decreasing the normal developmental accumulation of myelin (Harry et al., 1985). This interaction appeared to be more prevalent in females as compared to males. The decrement in myelin induced by development exposure to inorganic lead is a long-lasting effect that persists into adulthood (Toews, et al., 1980, Toews, et al., 1983). Myelination is not necessarily the most sensitive target for lead as low doses sufficient to produce some microscopically discernible hemorrhagic encephalopathy in the cerebellum of young rats did not depress myelination (Sundstrom and Karlsson, 1987); this hemorrhagic encephalopathy may be related to concentration of lead in brain capillaries (Toews et al., 1978).",

The pathologic effect varies with the age of the animal (Suzuki, 1971). Young rats exposed to TET develop severe spongious white matter similar to that seen in the adult, but with the absence of major clinical signs seen in the adult (Suzuki, 1971, Blaker, et al., 1981). It is thought that the severe paralysis seen in the adult animal is due in part to the intracranial pressure developed during severe edema, whereas the open cranial sutures in the young rat may allow for edema in the absence of increased pressure. When newborn rats are exposed to TET, brains became swollen and petechial hemorrhages are observed, particularly in the cerebellum. Necrotic cells were found diffusely throughout the brain (Watanabe, 1977). When older (postnatal day 8) animals were exposed, both the hemorrhagic and necrotic changes occurred, but damage was also seen in the myelinated fibers of the brain stem and cerebellum. Although the morphologic alterations in myelin dissipate with time, biochemical evidence suggests that the amount of myelin produced is decreased and that this myelin deficit persists through adulthood (Blaker, et al., 1981, Toews, et al., 1983). Chronic exposure to TET from 2 to 30 days after birth decreases myelin yield and cerebroside content (55%) and 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic nucleotide 3\u2032-phosphohydrolase activity (20%) (Blaker et al., 1981). In studies using radioactive tracer, Smith (1973) demonstrated that it is the newly forming CNS myelin that is preferentially susceptible to degradation by TET. Interestingly, administration of TET to quaking mice did not produce intramyelinic edema (Nagara et al., 1981).",

Both CNS and PNS myelin show a severe white matter edema following exposure, and young rats are more vulnerable than adults (Towfighi et al., 1974). In young rats, edema of the myelin sheath becomes evident after postnatal day 15, probably because the myelin membrane provides a hydrophobic reservoir for accumulation of this toxic compound and thereby becomes a significant site for fluid accumulation (Nieminen et al., 1973). Developmental exposure results in a decrease of the normal accumulation of myelin during development (Matthieu et al., 1974). In 22-day-old rats nursed by mothers fed hexachlorophene, there was a decrease in myelin yield, yet the myelin composition remained normal.

The loss of myelin can reach as much as 70% in white matter regions of the cerebrum (Carey and Freeman, 1983). Deficits in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production secondary to reduced activity of cytochrome oxidase (a copper-requiring enzyme) may lead to alterations in energy-requiring ion transport mechanisms, but the underlying reason for targeting of this compound to CNS myelin is not clear. Interestingly, cuprizone inhibits carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme present in myelin, and this inhibition takes place well before any demyelination is observed (Komoly et al., 1987). In experimental studies of cuprizone neurotoxicity, mRNA for MAG, a protein located at the myelin\u2013axonal interface, is down-regulated during demyelination and returns to normal levels following cessation of exposure (Fujita et al., 1990). The mRNA for this glycoprotein exists in two major splice variants that are both severely down-regulated. On recovery, one splice variant returns to normal levels whereas the exposure to cuprizone (9 weeks or longer in mice) results in irreversible demyelination (Tansey et al., 1996), possibly due to death of oligodendrocytes and/or oligodendroglial precursor cells.",

When tellurium exposure is discontinued, there is rapid and synchronous remyelination. Although tellurium toxicity in humans is rare, this model is of considerable interest as a system for studying the manner in which a specific metabolic insult can lead to demyelination. Because there is little or no associated axonal degeneration, it has also proved useful for examining events and processes related to PNS remyelination, independently of processes related to axonal regeneration.",

            "text": "Inclusion of 1\u20131.5% elemental tellurium in the diet of weanling rats leads to a primary segmental demyelination of about 20\u201325% of myelinating internodes in the sciatic nerve, but with sparing of axons (Bouldin, et al., 1988, Harry, et al., 1989). This demyelination results in a peripheral neuropathy characterized by hindlimb paresis and paralysis. Older rats are much more resistant to tellurium, and the CNS is generally not affected, although some pathologic alterations can be induced with prolonged exposure periods. The nature of the underlying metabolic insult has been delineated. Tellurium blocks cholesterol synthesis, specifically by inhibiting the enzyme squalene epoxidase, an obligate step in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway (Harry, et al., 1989, Wagner-Recio, et al., 1991, Wagner, et al., 1995). Tellurite, a water-soluble oxidized metabolite of the administered insoluble element, is the active species in vitro, effective at micromolar concentrations in a cell-free system (Wagner et al., 1995). The organotellurium compound dimethyltelluronium dichloride, (CH3)2TeCl2, is also effective in inhibiting squalene epoxidase in cultured Schwann cells and in inducing demyelination when administered intraperitoneally (Goodrum, 1997). Presumably, the resulting cholesterol deficit in Schwann cells eventually leads to an inability to maintain preexisting myelin and to assemble new myelin; this in turn leads to the observed demyelination. Although the tellurium-induced inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis is systemic, deleterious effects are confined largely to the sciatic nerve. In the liver, which supplies cholesterol for most body tissues, the resulting intracellular cholesterol deficit results in a marked upregulation of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway (Toews, et al., 1991b, Wagner-Recio, et al., 1991, Wagner, et al., 1995), presumably via well-characterized feedback mechanisms (see Goldstein and Brown, 1990, for review). This allows normal levels of cholesterol synthesis in this tissue despite considerable inhibition of one of the steps in the synthesis pathway, and normal levels of lipoprotein-associated circulating cholesterol are maintained. However, unlike many other tissues, the sciatic nerve cannot use circulating cholesterol; all cholesterol required for myelin in the sciatic nerve must be synthesized locally (Jurevics and Morell, 1994). This fact, coupled with the great demand for cholesterol in the rapidly myelinating PNS at the time of tellurium exposure, may account for the specificity of toxicity observed.",

The latter include HMG\u2013CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. Although this enzyme is markedly up-regulated in the liver (as expected from the tellurium-induced intracellular sterol deficit), it is down-regulated in the sciatic nerve in concert with other myelin-related genes (Toews et al., 1991b). Failure to up-regulate the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in the sciatic nerve is, in fact, probably the major underlying reason for the preferential susceptibility of this tissue. The co-ordinate down-regulation for myelin-related genes seen following exposure to tellurium suggests that gene expression of all proteins involved in myelin synthesis and assembly may be under the co-ordinate control of the overall program for myelination (see Morell and Toews, 1996a, Toews, et al., 1997, for discussion). The coordinate down-regulation of myelin gene expression takes place in all myelinating Schwann cells and not just in those undergoing demyelination (Toews et al., 1992). Thus, this down-regulation is not just a secondary response to injury but rather reflects the co-ordinate control of myelin gene expression. When tellurium exposure is discontinued, there is co-ordinate up-regulation of these messages during the remyelinating period.",
