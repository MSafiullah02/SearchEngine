JEV infection ranks as a leading cause of high morbidity and mortality rate in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific region (Chung et al., 2007). The JEV genome contains structural and non-structural (NS) genes (Sumiyoshi et al., 1987a, Sumiyoshi et al., 1987b). There are three structural genes; capsid protein (C) and involved in capsid formation, pre-membrane (prM) and Envelope (E). The E protein (53\u201355 KDa) contains two potential glycosylation sites (Dutta et al., 2010) responsible for the virus attachment, fusion, penetration, cell tropism, virulence and attenuation (Lindenbach et al., 2007) while prM contains only one glycosylation site and is important for the virus release and pathogenesis (Kim et al., 2008). There are seven NS genes: NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, NS5 and these are involved in the virus replication.",

            "text": "Griffithsin (GRFT) isolated from red alga Griffithsia sp is a plant-derived antiviral protein which exerts antiviral activity against several enveloped viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (O\u2019Keefe et al., 2010a), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 (O\u2019Keefe et al., 2009a) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Meuleman et al., 2011). It was found that, the purified GRFT exhibited antiviral activity comparable to the native one (Mori et al., 2005, O\u2019Keefe et al., 2009b). GRFT has a high affinity to interact with the viral glycosylated proteins and prevent its entry into cells, and this was attributed to its dimeric structure that demonstrates six binding sites (Ziolkowska et al., 2006). In related studies, GRFT was found to bind the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV, gp120 of HIV-1 and E1 and E2 glycoproteins of HCV (O\u2019Keefe et al., 2009a, O\u2019Keefe et al., 2010a, Meuleman et al., 2011). In our previous study (Ishag et al., 2013), we have shown that, the GRFT could inhibit JEV infection. However, there is a critical gap in understanding of how GRFT functions effectively to inhibit JEV infection. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to further detail whether GRFT could also bind to the glycosylated JEV protein (E and prM) to inhibit its infection in BHK-21 cells. We found that, GRFT binds to the JEV glycosylated viral proteins, specifically E and prM. We also observed that, the incubation of GRFT with mannose before interacting with the virus, was competitively inhibited binding of GRFT to the virus, which blocks the anti-JEV effect of GRFT. We suggested that, the binding of GRFT to the glycosylated virus proteins, may contribute to its anti-JEV activity. In summary, our data suggested the mechanism and potential of GRFT in the development of therapeutics against JEV infection.",

            "text": "In our previous study, we observed that, the recombinant GRFT exhibited an anti-JEV activity. In the present study, we further aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which GRFT exerts its anti-JEV activity. As in other viruses such as SARS-CoV, HCV and HIV-1, it was found that GRFT binds to the glycosylated viral proteins to inhibit its infection. It is therefore likely that the anti-JEV activity of GRFT may be due to the binding of GRFT to the JEV glycosylated proteins (E and prM). To address this, we used an experimental approach of Pull-down assay and CO-IP assay. Our results showed that GRFT could bind to E and prM glycosylated JEV proteins, similar to its function in other viruses such as SARS-CoV, HCV and HIV-1. This binding activity of GRFT was found to be inhibited by increasing concentrations of mannose. As E protein in JEV is responsible for the virus attachment, fusion, penetration, cell tropism, virulence and attenuation (Lindenbach et al., 2007) while prM is important for the virus release and pathogenesis (Kim et al., 2008), we expect that, the virus inhibition observed, could be attributed to GRFT effect. It was shown that GRFT exists as a dimmer with six separate binding sites that bind to N-linked glycans on virus glycoproteins (Zi\u00f3\u0142kowska et al., 2006). Therefore, the interaction of GRFT with E and prM might inhibit the conformational change required for the virus\u2013target cell attachment essential for viral entry and cell-to-cell fusion. However, this inhibition activity of GRFT was found to vary from virus to another and this was explained by the differences in the binding affinity of GRFT to the viral glycosylated proteins (O\u2019Keefe et al., 2010b). This finding is in consistence with antiviral mechanisms of other lectins such as Cyanovirin-N (CV-N) that binds to the HIV-1 surface glycoprotein gp120 to inhibit its infection (Boyd et al., 1997).",

Similarly, we also expect that, the conformational alteration caused by interaction of GRFT with JEV glycoproteins (Bressanelli et al., 2004) may expose the hidden epitopes of JEV glycoprotein, allowing the immune system to become actively involved in inhibiting the JEV infection (Balzarini, 2007).",
