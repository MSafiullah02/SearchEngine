            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of enveloped RNA viruses with positive\u2010sense single\u2010stranded RNA genome, affecting a wide range of animal species. Some widely spread human coronaviruses (HCoVs, i.e., strains 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1) are the etiologic agents in 15\u201330% of common cold disease,1 a relatively benign yet highly contagious respiratory illness that can possibly be complicated by virus\u2010induced asthma or exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.2 These HCoVs can also cause high\u2010morbidity lower respiratory tract conditions, such as pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and croup, especially in immunocompromised patients, the elderly and young children.3, 4, 5 Besides, two highly pathogenic CoVs originating from animal reservoirs have had a major medical and socio\u2010economic impact. In 2003, the newly discovered SARS\u2010CoV6 responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome, suddenly emerged in South\u2010East Asia, after which it caused 8096 infections worldwide with a case\u2010fatality (CFR) rate of 9.6% and a total societal cost estimated at 40 billion USD.7 In 2012, the thus far unknown Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus (MERS\u2010CoV) appeared6 which, to date, caused 2249 cases with a CFR of 36%.8 The high virulence of SARS\u2010 and MERS\u2010CoVs, combined with their sudden emergence and clear pandemic potential, has boosted the development of preventive (i.e., vaccines) or therapeutic (i.e., antiviral drugs) interventions to address serious CoV infections in humans. Thus far, except for quarantine measures, no effective intervention exists.",

The first evidence for the formation of 7 and 8 was the observation of a new band between 1728\u20131697 cm\u22121 in their IR spectra due to 3\u2010carbonyl group. The C=O stretching band of the carboxamide moiety was also observed at 1660\u20131693 cm\u22121. Bands between 3468\u20133167 cm\u22121 region confirmed the presence of NH stretching bands. In the 1H\u2010NMR spectra of 7, CONH protons were observed at \u03b4 9.91\u201310.59 ppm as singlets. C2\u2013methylene protons of 7a\u2013g and 8a\u2013h resonated at \u03b4 3.52\u20133.64 ppm as singlets, while C2\u2010methine protons of 7h\u2013n and 8i\u2013p gave quartets at \u03b4 3.80\u20133.93 ppm. The 13C\u2010NMR spectra of 7a\u2013m and 8j showed spirothiazolidinone C2 carbon (\u03b4 27.76\u201338.08 ppm) and spirothiazolidinone C=O carbon (\u03b4 167.59\u2013170.77 ppm) resonances as another evidence for the formation of a ring system. Molecular weights (for the group coded as 7) were verified by taking mass spectra to get another proof. ESI method was applied in positive or negative modes and [M+H]+ or [M\u2010H]\u2212 ions formed confirmed the molecular weights.",

The compounds showing activity all carry a methyl substituent at the C\u20102 position of the azaspiro[4.5]decane (R1), whereas the unmethylated analogs (i.e., 7e, 7f, 8c, 8d, 8e, 8f, 8h) were devoid of antiviral activity. The same observation was previously made for the structurally related influenza virus fusion inhibitors.9 In addition, for compound series 8, the anti\u2010coronavirus activity clearly depended on the bulkiness of the C\u20108 substituent of the azaspiro[4.5]decane (R). No activity was seen for the unsubstituted compound 8j (R = H). Intermediate activity was observed for 8k and 8l (EC50 = 28 and 18 \u00b5M), which carry a 4\u2010methyl and 4\u2010ethyl\u2010group, respectively. A further increase in activity was seen for 8m, 8n, and 8p (EC50 values 5.5\u20138.1 \u00b5M), carrying, respectively, a 4\u2010propyl, 4\u2010tert\u2010butyl and 4\u2010phenyl group. An exception here is 8o (R = 4\u2010CF3), which did not show antiviral activity at concentrations up to 100 \u00b5M. Its direct analog belonging to Group 7 (7m) however, was moderately active (EC50 = 31 \u00b5M), and so was 7n (EC50 = 12 \u00b5M), which carries the same substituent (4\u2010phenyl) as 8p. Molecules 7k and 7l, which are the counterparts of 8k and 8n, were not active.",

The anti\u2010coronavirus activity was found to be strongly dependent on the substituents at the C\u20102 and C\u20108 positions of the azaspiro[4.5]decane scaffold. While a series of closely related analogs was previously demonstrated to target influenza virus fusion by interfering with hemagglutinin refolding at low pH, the present molecules have no activity against human influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B viruses.
