To detect significant differences between groups, we used the chi-square test or Fisher exact test for categorical variables and the t test or Mann\u2013Whitney test for continuous variables, as appropriate. A multivariate logistic analysis, including significant variables in univariate analysis and clinically important variables, was performed to detect factors associated with severe disease. The relative risks were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI. The possibility of multicollinearity among variables was measured by means of correlation coefficient matrix. A value of 0.75 or higher among variables were considered as multicollinearity. Calibration of the model was evaluated by the goodness-of-fit according to the Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow test. We also tested the ability of the Bewick et al.14 scoring system for identifying patients with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09-related pneumonia by means of the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios (LR). The Bewick 5-point scoring system is a model based in five clinical criteria: age \u2264 65 years, mental orientation, temperature \u2265 38 \u00b0C, leucocyte count \u226412 \u00d7 10(9)/l and bilateral radiographic consolidation.

            "text": "The accuracy of the scoring system described by Bewick et al.14 for identifying influenza A (H1N1)pdm09-related pneumonia was moderate in the present external validation, as the statistical analysis demonstrates (AUROC 0.77). However, it should be noted that the model was less useful for identifying patients with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09-related pneumonia and bacterial co-infection (AUROC 0.70). In addition, sensitivity and (to a lesser extent) specificity were low in diagnosis of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09-related pneumonia in this clinical context. Thus, a course of antiviral therapy guided solely by the application of the model would have left 2.5% (including those with bacterial co-infection) of the patients with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09-related pneumonia without specific coverage (score of 0 or 1), and would have led to administration of an unnecessary antiviral regimen to 58.2% of patients classified with scores of 4 or 5. In addition, the model was unable to distinguish between influenza A (H1N1)pdm09-related pneumonia and other aetiologies in most cases, because 41% of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09-related pneumonia cases and 51.6% of cases with other aetiologies fell into the values of 3 and 4. Thus, rather than identifying patients who benefit from treatment, the most useful finding of the scoring system proposed by Bewick et al.14 is that antiviral treatment might be avoided in some patients with a score of 0 or 1.",

Thus, this cohort is representative of patients hospitalised with a pneumonic illness during the first post-pandemic period. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, no prior study has evaluated microbial patterns and outcomes in CAP during this period. Moreover, nearly 90% of patients underwent viral PCR and 95% underwent one or more bacterial identification tests. However, our study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. Firstly, we did not compare our cohort of patients with those of other epidemiological periods to explore for differences in outcomes. Secondly, PCR testing was mainly performed on samples obtained via a nasopharyngeal swab. Evidence suggests that the yield of positive PCR results from nasopharyngeal swabs in patients with confirmed positive lower respiratory tract samples is nearly 80%. However, sampling was repeated when clinical suspicion was high in some cases in the present study. Thirdly, as serologic methods were not used to determine antibodies against atypical agents, these microorganisms are under-represented. Lastly, hospital and ICU admission criteria were not standardized. However, to detect factors associated with severe disease, we performed a multivariate analysis to control for confounding factors. In addition, a post hoc analysis was performed considering ICU admission and intubation as dependent variable. Notably, the usefulness of biomarkers to predict prognosis was not evaluated in the present study.",
