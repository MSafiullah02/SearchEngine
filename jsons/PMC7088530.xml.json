Individual case surveillance identifies people with particular diseases (such as tuberculosis or syphilis) and provides the option to intervene to treat and to stop spread. In its traditional form, such case surveillance involves specification of a list of \u201creportable\u201d diseases to an entity such as a department of health, followed by treatment and/or contact tracing as deemed necessary. It also involves reporting or monitoring of laboratory testing results for identified organisms, toxins, or other suspected agents of disease. In complement, statistical surveillance identifies disease trends in populations: incidence, prevalence, distribution, and the like (Stoto 2008).",

For example, the World Health Regulations in effect until 2007 required reporting of cholera, yellow fever, and plague\u2014but only these three diseases (Chretien et al. 2008). In the United States, under the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS), disease surveillance at the federal level has been voluntary, and based on case reports under reporting systems mandated at the state level and alerts from clinicians and laboratories about disease clusters (Centers for Disease Control, National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System). At the state level, public health statutes typically require reporting of specified infectious diseases (NY CLS Pub Health \u00a7 2130 2008), cancer diagnoses (e.g., California Health & Safety Code [Deering\u2019s] \u00a7 103885 2008), workplace toxins (Minn. Stat. \u00a7 175.33 2008), and more recently agents associated with bioterrorism (Ariz. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 36\u2013782 2008). Other recent proposals have extended surveillance beyond contagious disease and environmental toxins, the traditional domains of public health, to identify incidence and prevalence of diseases such as diabetes\u2014an expansion that has come under criticism (Mariner 2007).",

            "text": "However, with emerging contagious diseases such as HIV or SARS, new strains of influenza, or as-yet-to-be-imagined agents of bioterrorism, illness may reach pandemic proportions if effective surveillance must wait upon identification of a diagnosis or disease-causing agent that is the object of interest. Instead, observation and subsequent investigation of behavioral or symptom patterns of potential significance is an important way of ascertaining a developing public health threat. The basic idea of such \u201csyndromic surveillance\u201d is to collect real-time data about disease indicators in order to detect possible outbreaks of diseases even before the diseases themselves have been identified (Buehler et al. 2004; Mandl et al. 2004). Syndromic surveillance thus relies on a wide variety of data available in electronic or other forms beyond those used in traditional surveillance (Chretien et al. 2008; Heffernan et al. 2004). This includes information such as data about chief complaints, symptoms, medication sales; grocery store purchases such as pediatric electrolyte formulas or even orange juice; absenteeism from work or school; or internet queries for topics such as \u201cinfluenza\u201d or \u201cfever.\u201d1 For example, an important data source in syndromic surveillance is emergency room visits. One of the measures of disaster preparedness employed in the American College of Emergency Physicians\u2019 report card on the status of emergency medicine in the United States is the presence of real-time surveillance systems for common emergency department presentations (American College of Emergency Physicians 2009). As an illustration, North Dakota receives daily electronic feeds of chief complaint data from eight large emergency rooms in the state (North Dakota Health Department). Such feeds can alert public health officials about unusual clusters or increased rates of symptoms such as diarrhea, respiratory illness, or joint pain\u2014and trigger further investigation about what might be causing the observed phenomena. In Europe, syndromic surveillance has been developed quite extensively (Smith et al. 2006; Josseran et al. 2006).",

            "text": "Syndromic surveillance, as thus understood, is based on novel data sources and data-mining techniques: emergency department data in electronic form, electronic medical records, electronic prescription data, pharmacy purchases, reported absenteeism, and traffic on the web in particular (Sengupta et al. 2008; Mandl et al. 2004). Such surveillance presents new possibilities and new challenges. One difficulty in the construction of syndromic surveillance techniques is validation: for example, is an increase in certain pharmacy purchases indicative of a rise in respiratory disease? (One study concludes that it is (van den Wijngaard et al. 2008).) Other studies have concluded that reports of respiratory symptoms in pediatric emergency rooms are indicative of a rise in respiratory syncytial virus (Bourgeois et al. 2006). On the other hand, purchases of antivirals may be generated by individual decisions to stockpile after publicity about influenza, rather than with any increased rates of influenza itself (Centers for Disease Control 2006). Concerns have also been raised about the accuracy of syndromic surveillance at single institutions; however, the problem may be limited data rather than methodological difficulties with syndromic surveillance per se (Weber and Pitrak 2003). Even when measures are validated, sensitivity and specificity pose additional problems. It is desirable to have highly sensitive measures to avoid missing detection of potentially serious outbreaks, but this raises concerns about false positives and attendant costs and risks (Buehler et al. 2004).",

This identification is typically codified by legislative action or administrative rule-making. There has thus been a degree of public oversight of the decision to make a disease reportable. However, as we detail below, even recent and proposed reforms of public health law have not anticipated the full range of possibilities syndromic surveillance may present. Thus, as it has developed to date, syndromic surveillance has not been subject to the level of public scrutiny that has attended traditional public health surveillance. Legally-established reporting regimes typically also implement mechanisms for protecting the confidentiality of any reported data, but comparable regimes have not been fully developed for protecting the data obtained for purposes of syndromic surveillance.",

A physician recommending testing to a patient for HIV or syphilis can explain the significance of a positive test result before the patient agrees to the test. With new methods of syndromic surveillance, by contrast, issues of informed consent and data use are far less well analyzed and understood. As it involves the identification of patterns of interest, patients and providers may not know in advance that a particular symptomatic report entered into an electronic medical record will be of any significance whatsoever: whether this fever triggers interest may only be known after a pattern of fevers is observed in an interoperable set of electronic records. Moreover, no informed consent process at all is involved in such activities as purchase of an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal or a search of the web for information about managing fever.",

Such data collection practices pose risks to patient confidentiality if data security is imperfectly protected (Myers et al. 2008). To be sure, some syndromic surveillance in the United States involves \u201cde-identified\u201d electronic health data, health records from which a defined list of identifying information has been removed as set out in the federal privacy rule for medical information transmitted in electronic form (HIPAA 2008).2 However, increasingly concerns have been raised about whether de-identified data can be readily re-identified, especially when data sets are combined (Porter 2008), as data sets are likely to be under robust syndromic surveillance regimes. Consider, for example, combining electronic medical records, pharmacy purchase data, and grocery store purchases of over-the-counter remedies using a frequent-shopper discount card that contains purchaser identifying information. Moreover, entities issuing de-identified data sets may keep coded identifiers to permit re-identification in case of public health need (Sengupta et al. 2008). Thus there may be risks to patient confidentiality even when de-identified data sets are employed for syndromic surveillance. These very real risks to confidentiality highlight the importance of careful consideration of regimes for data protection if syndromic surveillance is to be employed.",

Syndromic surveillance may identify suspected higher rates of illness or disease risk in particular populations. One quite recent example of group stigmatization involved an HIV exposure alarm among students at a particular school (whose school population happened to be 99% African-American) (Gay 2008).3 Stigmatization has also been alleged concerning minority patients with diabetes in New York City (Goldman et al. 2008).

The data collection in syndromic surveillance, as it has developed so far, is just the beginning. Surely, as more robust systems of electronic health records are put into play, more extensive data mining for public health purposes will come into play. But there is more. Consider the thought experiment\u2014or perhaps realistic proposal\u2014that we developed elsewhere: universal rapid testing for infectious disease in airports, on public transit, at schools, workplaces, movies and sporting events (Battin et al. 2009, Ch. 15). Or suppose that it were possible to detect overall temperature levels in a population by means of remote thermal imaging. Suppose this could be done in such a way that no one was aware that data were being collected and no information about particular individuals was included in the data collection. All that was ascertained was the occurrence of shifts in the amount of heat emitted by bodies of a given size in a particular area. Such sensing is a technologically possible method for determining whether there has been an increase in bodily temperatures in a population\u2014and a possible method for determining whether a corresponding rise in infection rates has been occurring in a population. Although remote thermal sensing of people while they are in their homes would likely be an unreasonable search and seizure under United States law, this use of thermal imaging could be a very effective way of ascertaining increased rates of infectious disease in a population, perhaps even more effective than monitoring data about purchases of aspirin or acetaminophen in local pharmacies.4\n",

As we have already indicated, the novel uses of data in syndromic surveillance may place serious pressures on confidentiality. To take just one example, if a novel influenza strain appears as it apparently did in the spring of 2009, intense efforts may be devoted to identifying and detaining air travelers with potential exposures (Centers for Disease Control 2008). Although these two concepts are often used interchangeably, privacy refers to the initial intrusion\u2014the contact from which data are obtained\u2014and confidentiality refers to individual control over the information thus obtained. From the victim/vector perspective, it is not clear that privacy is the more important value. Protection from each other as vectors may be significantly inadequate without the initial access that allows data to be gathered. At the same time, if confidentiality is not protected and people are identified, then risks of harm may be significant. These risks stem from the information becoming known, not from its being gathered in the first place; the only likely harm, for example, from a grocery store keeping an electronic record of an aspirin purchase, even a purchase linked to a particular individual, might be identification of that individual as being ill. The reason for protecting privacy is not the harm involved in the moment of data gathering; it is instead the concern that, once gathered, the data will inevitably come to light. To put the point succinctly, confidentiality is the reason for protecting privacy, not the reverse (Francis 2008).",

Local authorities are also expected to be able to implement preliminary control measures immediately.

They include, in addition, assessment of the urgency of the situation and the ability to transmit information about any urgent situations to national authorities.

However, in fashioning the requirements for surveillance and reporting, the Regulations define a public health emergency of international concern as \u201can extraordinary event which is determined . . . to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response\u201d (International Health Regulations, art. 1). This definition elides whether the reference is only to identified diagnoses or agents or includes syndromic identification as well. Although the definition of \u201csurveillance\u201d quoted above is surely broad enough to include syndromic surveillance, nothing more specific is stated about the possibilities. In discussing the resource issues raised by the Regulations, Chretien et al. (2008) give illustrations of successful establishment of syndromic surveillance capacity in Indonesia and Peru. It seems increasingly likely, moreover, that as syndromic surveillance techniques become better developed, pressures will increase for their use in detecting emerging disease before spread becomes likely\u2014especially, we might hypothesize, spread to more affluent areas of the world.",

The Regulations state that all measures should be implemented in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner (International Health Regulations, art. 42), but do not set out any specific requirements for what this might involve. With respect to privacy, Article 45 states both that data should be processed anonymously and that personal information may be used when needed, so long as they are processed fairly and not kept longer than necessary (International Health Regulations, art. 45). These provisions are quite vague, however, and do not attend specifically to the privacy and confidentiality issues that may be raised by increasing use of non-traditional forms of surveillance. Although the Regulations commit more affluent countries to helping others in developing surveillance capacities (International Health Regulations, art. 44), they do not include commitments to more extensive development of the health infrastructure needed to ensure that treatment is available to the extent possible for those who are identified as disease threats.",
