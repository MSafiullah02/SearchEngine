NWs were collected using 5 mL of saline per nostril for adults (2.5 mL/nostril for children), and combined with oropharyngeal swabs for testing. A research specimen was generally collected within 14 days before the scheduled HCT regardless of respiratory symptoms. During the study period, NWs were routinely collected for respiratory viruses from all patients with pretransplant respiratory symptoms; therefore, clinical samples may have been collected before, after, or instead of research samples. If a research sample was collected in the absence of a clinical sample, it was designated as asymptomatic surveillance. From December 2007 to April 2008, collection of pretransplant screening NW was instituted because of an RSV outbreak. The collection of pre-HCT surveillance specimens regardless of symptoms was routine for children aged <8 years until November 2009, when collection was extended to include children aged \u226417 years. Results of clinical viral testing from symptomatic patients, patients screened during RSV outbreaks, and children with surveillance NWs were known to the ordering provider per clinical practice.

Patients with other pretransplant viruses, including HRV, had significantly fewer days alive and out of hospital. Patients with HRV had significantly higher day 100 mortality than uninfected patients. One possible reason for this difference is that most patients with RSV and influenza received either antiviral treatment or underwent delay to transplant, whereas fewer patients with HRV had transplant delayed and thus remained positive at conditioning. Although some studies have indicated that pretransplant rhinovirus infection may not be a serious problem [15], HRV has been reported to cause lower respiratory tract disease, with outcomes similar to influenza and other respiratory viruses [16\u201318].",

Unadjusted analysis of asymptomatic patients with surveillance samples found no increase in bronchoscopy incidence or overall mortality, but a borderline significant decrease was seen in days out-of-hospital in patients with a pre-HCT respiratory virus detected. This suggests that asymptomatic patients shedding respiratory viruses before HCT may require more care and utilize more resources after HCT, compared with those not shedding respiratory viruses before HCT. Patients with symptoms and any respiratory virus detected had no significant difference in bronchoscopy incidence or hospitalization days compared with uninfected patients, although there was a trend toward lower survival at day 100.

Our analysis of individual viruses remains limited by small numbers of patients; virus-specific conclusions are not straightforward. Similarly, we analyzed pediatric and adult patients together to increase the power of our analysis, making it difficult to draw separate conclusions for adults and children. Analysis of surveillance samples vs symptomatic samples was limited by the small number of events, precluding multivariable analysis. Because results of respiratory virus testing were known for symptomatic patients, management and outcomes may have been influenced. We also combined data for samples collected for clinical care, outbreak investigation, and research, potentially resulting in unforeseen differences between these groups. Although we are able to make broad conclusions about outcomes in patients with and without a pretransplant respiratory virus, and in those patients with and without symptoms, predictive algorithms for every situation are not possible. Respiratory virus testing closer to conditioning onset could be considered, particularly in patients with known infections (Table 4). In addition, a potential limitation of molecular testing is that detection of viral RNA in asymptomatic or previously treated patients may not represent replicating virus.",

Thoughtful deliberation must be given regarding underlying disease, transplant type, underlying immunosuppression, and specific viruses.

Our results suggest that even pretransplant rhinovirus infection is associated with poor outcomes and delay of transplant, or possibly, that milder conditioning regimens should be considered. This likely applies most to patients with symptomatic rhinovirus infection; further research to assess why rhinovirus is associated with poor outcomes is needed. Our data suggest that surveillance of asymptomatic patients without recent history of respiratory disease prior to HCT may not be necessary. However, further study to specifically address screening of asymptomatic patients before HCT is warranted. The application of this approach to children remains problematic, in part because relatively few children were studied, with high rates of pretransplant viruses detected (31% positivity in asymptomatic children). The high mortality in children aged <5 years (2 of 6 [33%]) with pre-HCT respiratory viruses is noteworthy. Because effective treatment is unavailable for many respiratory viruses and delay of HCT is often not feasible, these data emphasize the need for intensified prevention of respiratory virus acquisition before transplant and improved management strategies, including development of new antiviral agents and other prophylactic strategies.",
