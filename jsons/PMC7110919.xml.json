The pathogen of COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]), identified as a member of the Coronaviridae family. Another coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-1, was responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome.1 Compared with SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 has a similar binding receptor and similar pathologic features systemically and epidemiological characteristics.1,2 Although there is no direct evidence that SARS-CoV-1 replication results in conjunctivitis and other ocular diseases, reports have emphasized the eye as a potential site for virus transmission.3 Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the eye has been suspected.",

This study was approved by the ethics committee of Yichang Central People\u2019s Hospital, and all patients gave written informed consent. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 13.0 (SPSS Inc). Means for continuous variables were compared using independent-group t test when the data were normally distributed; otherwise, the Mann-Whitney test was used. Proportions for categorical variables were compared using the \u03c72 and Fisher exact test as appropriate. For unadjusted comparisons, a 2-sided \u03b1 of less than .05 was considered statistically significant.",

Among these 12 patients, there were 4 cases judged as moderate, 2 cases judged as severe, and 6 cases judged as critical, which was graded according to the guideline of PC-NCP4: moderate indicated fever and/or respiratory symptoms and lung computed tomography imaging findings; severe indicated dyspnea (respiratory frequency of 30 cycles per minute or greater), blood oxygen saturation of 93% or less, and an arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of oxygen inspiration ratio of 300 or less; and critical indicated respiratory failure or shock or multiple organ dysfunction/failure.4 In these patients, 1 patient experienced epiphora as the first symptom of COVID-19. None of them experienced blurred vision. By univariate analysis, patients with ocular symptoms were more likely to have higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts and higher levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase than patients without ocular symptoms (Table 1). In addition, 11 of 12 patients with ocular abnormalities (91.7%; 95% CI, 61.5-99.8) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs.
