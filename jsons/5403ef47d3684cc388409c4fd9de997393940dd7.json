These initial symptoms include fever, headache, myalgias, malaise, and sore throat (Del Rio et al. 2014) . Toward the end of the first week, fever, headache, and malaise continue and the onset of the gastrointestinal (GI) phase begins (Chertow et al. 2014; Lyon et al. 2014) . After the first few days of illness, a rash may also appear. The rash can be either a classic viral exanthem or petechial.

After 2-3 days, the vomiting begins to improve, but the diarrhea continues to worsen. It is common for many patients to continue losing between 3 and 5 L of fluid per day and in the severest cases can be up to 10 L of output per day per rectum . Massive fluid loss along with vascular leakage which occurs in Ebola virus disease (EVD) can lead to intravascular hypovolemic dehydration.

As a consequence of the GI phase and viral sepsis, intravascular hypovolemia and vascular leakage, organ failure can develop. Coagulopathy, renal failure, and respiratory failure are the most commonly encountered organ systems which fail. Coagulopathy typically manifests as clinical bleeding. GI bleeding is the most common manifestation. Patients may also experience oozing from venipuncture sites and intravenous catheter sites (Uyeki et al. 2016b ; Respiratory vaccine shows promise 2014; Qin et al. 2015; Bah et al. 2015) . In previous EVD outbreaks, bleeding from gums and the urinary tract have also been noted. Bleeding complications has also been linked to poor outcomes (Ndambi et al. 1999) . Renal failure is an uncommon complication of EVD occurring in about 5% of cases (Bah et al. 2015) . Although uncommon, renal failure has historically been associated with increased mortality (Schieffelin et al. 2014 ). Renal failure is felt to be either pre-renal from shock (Bah et al. 2015) or from acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from direct infection of the renal tubules by Ebola virus (Martines et al. 2015) .",

            "text": "Death from EVD has been associated with several clinical features or demographic characteristics. Older age is associated with a higher risk of dying from EVD. For patients who have or might get EVD, forty years is old. This has been noted across multiple outbreaks of EVD with different variants of Ebola viruses, from Kikwit in the 1990s to West Africa in 2014-2016. In addition to age, severity of illness is another predictor of mortality. For EVD, this is borne out as higher viral load, higher temperature, higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) concentrations, and higher AST concentrations. Higher BUN and Cr concentrations represent renal failure, and higher AST concentration represents increased liver injury. Clinically evident hemorrhagic manifestations such as melena, petechiae, ecchymoses, and oozing puncture sites are all associated with increased mortality (Roddy et al. 2012; Geisbert 2015) . The 2014-2016 outbreak in West Africa may have indicated that the level of care is also associated with mortality. The overall mortality from EVD in West Africa was 40% (WHO 2016). However, in persons who were evacuated from West Africa to either Europe or the USA, the mortality rate was 18.5% (Uyeki et al. 2016b) . This suggests that the higher level of care provided outside of West Africa decreased the mortality rate by half. Of the 27 patients who were evacuated out of Africa, five died and three of those had respiratory and renal failure (Uyeki et al. 2016b ). However, there were nine total patients who had respiratory failure and nine patients who had oliguria indicating possible renal failure. Seven of the nine with respiratory failure received mechanical ventilation, and five of the nine with renal failure received dialysis (Uyeki et al. 2016b) . These patients had severe illness yet the mortality rate was half of what was seen in West Africa. What is not clear is whether these patients would have lived or died had they remained in West Africa. But, it seems plausible that improving the level of supportive care in West Africa may reduce the mortality associated with any future outbreaks of EVD.",

Expectant management means anticipating potential problems and pitfalls and taking corrective action before they actually arise. In this way, problems can be avoided or mitigated. Knowing that patients with EVD can develop hypokalemia, providers may choose to supplement potassium as the gastrointestinal phase develops. Similarly, expecting hemorrhage to potentially be an issue, transfusing platelets when the platelet counts reach 30-50 K/\u00b5L (as opposed to <20 K/\u00b5L), or providing fresh frozen plasma when the international normalized ratio (INR) is 1.5 should be strongly considered. Anticipating problems and intervening at an earlier time point than in usual clinical practice may help prevent a very sick patient from becoming a critically ill patient, hopefully saving the patient's life.",

Matching this volume loss with oral rehydration or intravenous fluids is challenging. However, it should be the goal of fluid replacement to maintain intravascular volume to avoid shock. If the patient has a lot of vomiting, it may be very difficult to do this with oral rehydration, and intravenous access should be obtained before significant dehydration develops. Intravenous replacement fluids should ideally be done with balanced crystalloid solutions such as lactated ringers, though the use of normal saline is certainly appropriate if balanced crystalloid solutions are not readily available. There is concern that relying solely on normal saline or similar fluids can result in hyperchloremia and potentially induce or exacerbate renal failure (Guidet et al. 2010 ). However, in EVD patients where colloidal products may also be needed, using normal saline as a carrier or to supplement colloids is likely very appropriate. Normal saline should not be avoided at the expense of maintaining intravascular volume.",

Therefore, correcting coagulopathy is a goal of supportive care in EVD. Again, early transfusion of platelets or infusion of clotting factors via fresh frozen plasma should be a goal when feasible. This may be more easily achieved in resource-rich environments where platelet counts and INR can be more closely monitored. As a surrogate, oozing from intravenous catheter sites or phlebotomy sites should prompt transfusion of platelets and fresh frozen plasma. If frank hemorrhage occurs as manifested by visible bleeding, hematemesis or melena, transfusion of platelets, clotting factors, and red blood cells is likely warranted. Here, the goal is to maintain acceptable hemoglobin levels and correct coagulopathy. Transfusion will likely also help maintain intravascular hydration and blood pressure.",

In patients evacuated to Europe or the USA, 20% had renal failure and two were described as having renal failure with anuria (Wolf et al. 2015; Connor et al. 2015) . Both of these patients received renal replacement therapy with dialysis. Both patients also had recovery of renal function such that dialysis was no longer needed by 2 months past onset of symptoms. In both of these cases, dialysate fluid was tested for the presence of Ebola virus (EBOV) RNA and was found in one instance at one of the institutions Wolf et al. 2015) . It should be noted that dialysis membranes are designed to allow the passage of electrolytes but not larger molecules such as proteins or viruses. Therefore, it would be expected that dialysate fluid should be without EBOV. But both institutions autoclaved dialysate fluid so as to eliminate the potential for environmental contamination (Wolf et al. 2015; Connor et al. 2015) . While renal failure is associated with a higher risk of dying from EVD, aggressively supporting the patient with dialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy can have positive, life-saving effects. Bah et al. (2015) reported severe pre-renal kidney failure in one of their patients. This patient responded well to intravascular rehydration with crystalloid intravenous solutions.",

Fatal arrhythmias developed in patients who die from EVD. Vascular leakage is a common phenomenon in EVD.

In addition, there exists an additional ebolavirus, Reston virus (RESTV) that is only known to cause disease in non-human primates. While aggressive supportive care remains the only therapeutic modality proven to be efficacious in treating patients with EVD, there have been ongoing efforts to develop agents specifically for EVD. The magnitude and longevity of the 2014-2016 West Africa EVD outbreak highlighted the need for efficacious therapeutics against Ebola viruses to augment the supportive care measures in the treatment of individual patients and also to assist in diminishing the spread of the virus in communities. Thus, the 2014-2016 EVD outbreak allowed for greater attention and support for research into the development of these therapeutics, many of which are now in clinical studies (WHO Web site http://www.who.int/medicines/emp_ebola_q_as/en/).

The first known use of this modality in EVD occurred during the 1976 outbreak when a laboratory worker had an occupational exposure and was infected with an Ebola virus. This patient received transfusions of two units of convalescent plasma and had a full recovery (Emond et al. 1977; Winkler and Koepsell 2015) . Following this experience, eight patients received whole blood transfusions obtained from five different EVD survivors during the 1995 EVD outbreak in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of Congo (Mupapa et al. 1999) . While only 1 patient who received these transfusions succumbed to EVD, this cohort received significantly higher levels of care than the majority of patients in the Kikwit outbreak (Mupapa et al. 1999) . Since this time, multiple animal studies have shown the potential efficacy of transferring a high-quality, species-specific convalescent serum/plasma for EBOV infections (Winkler and Koepsell 2015; Zeitlin et al. 2016) .",

            "text": "Once the 2014-2016 EVD outbreak caught international attention, there were calls from WHO and other agencies to explore the utilization of convalescent blood products for the multitude of patients in the EVD treatment units (ETUs) in affected nations (World Health Organization (WHO) 2014). The ability to safely separate and store vast amounts of whole blood or plasma from EVD survivors proved to be difficult in these resources-constrained environments undergoing a devastating epidemic. As a few nationals of European nations and the USA responding to the outbreak became infected with Ebola and were repatriated for treatment of EVD, the receiving centers began to explore collecting convalescent plasma from their recovered patients. The first use of a convalescent blood product for EVD outside of Africa occurred at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC), when plasma collected from a previous EVD survivor was transfused after informed consent to another patient in that ETU . Since that time, a national repository of Ebola Convalescent Plasma (ECP) has been created at Emory University in Atlanta, GA, USA, from survivors living in the USA, and multiple units have been distributed for the care of EVD patients in the USA Florescu et al. 2015; Liddell et al. 2015; Winkler and Koepsell 2015) . There were also several patients in Europe who received convalescent blood products (Uyeki et al. 2016b ). However, these few cases, in the absence of controlled clinical trials, do not provide adequate data to assess efficacy or safety of these products. Three clinical trials of ECP were initiated in West Africa, though enrollment was slow as the outbreak began to wane and data are not yet available. Until clinical trials of standardize convalescent plasma products are performed, it will remain unclear what is the role of these products in the treatment of EVD.",

This novel combination, later termed ZMapp\u2122 (Mapp Biopharma), was tested in a pivotal study by Qiu et al. (2014) , showing 100% protection in EBOV-infected rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) when treatment with this cocktail was initiated within 5 days of infection.

The original formulation, TKM-100802, was designed to target these three genes of the 1995 Kikwit EBOV variant. It was shown to prevent disease in 66 and 100% of rhesus macaques given four or seven, respectively, treatments of the agent after an otherwise lethal EBOV infection (Geisbert et al. 2010 ). The first human use of TKM-100802 occurred in two patients evacuated to the USA from West Africa in late 2014 ) and subsequently in three additional evacuated patients (Uyeki et al. 2016b ). However, these patients received advanced supportive and other experimental agents, making it difficult to ascertain any treatment effect of TKM-100802. Investigations in the matching of TKM-100802 to the new West African EBOV variant (Makona) revealed mismatches for the polymerase gene and the VP35 gene (Thi et al. 2015) . A new formulation, TKM-130803, was designed to better match the circulating EBOV strain and demonstrated good protection in a small study of rhesus macaques given an otherwise lethal inoculum of EBOV (Thi et al. 2015) . Based on these results, the Rapid Assessment of Potential Interventions and Drugs for Ebola (RAPIDE-TKM) trial was designed and launched in early 2015. In this single-arm phase 2 trial, patients with EVD were administered a 0.3 mg/kg intravenous infusion of TKM-130803 daily for up to seven days (Dunning et al. 2016 ). The study enrolled 14 patients, of whom 11 died and 3 survived, and subsequently, the trial was halted due to meeting its pre-specified futility threshold (Dunning et al. 2016 ).",

AVI-7537 has been evaluated in NHP models of EBOV infection, though usually in combination with AVI-7539, a PMO targeting the VP35 gene of EBOV (Madelain et al. 2016) . However, in one study, rhesus monkeys received either AVI-7537+AVI-7539, AVI-7537, AVI-7539, or placebo and found to have survival rates of 62.5, 75, 0, and 0%, respectively (Warren et al. 2015) . In addition, viral loads were similar in the AVI-7537 and AVI-7537 +AVI-7539 groups, but lower than the AVI-7539 and control groups (Warren et al. 2015) . These data indicated that AVI-7537 was potentially sufficient to prevent disease and thus moved forward for clinical development (Madelain et al. 2016) . AVI-7537 (in combination with AVI-7539) was evaluated in a phase I human study, showing it was well tolerated and without severe adverse reactions (Heald et al. 2014) . However, plans for further clinical trials are unknown at this time.",

Currently, almost 20 different vaccines are in preclinical or clinical development, almost 10 times the number in 2013 (Ohimain 2016) .

            "text": "VSV belongs to the Rhabdoviridae virus family and causes vesicles and ulcerations of the mouth, feet, and teats of livestock (Roberts et al. 1999) . A replication-competent recombinant VSV (rVSV)-vectored EBOV vaccine (rVSV-ZEBOV) was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). In August of 2014, PHAC donated 800 vaccine doses to the WHO to conduct rapid human studies. The VSV Ebola Consortium (VEBCON) designed a group of studies of these vaccines to assess the safety and immunogenicity of various doses of rVSV-ZEBOV in Gabon, Kenya, Germany, and Switzerland (Agnandji et al. 2016) . A total of 158 healthy adults received either rVSV-ZEBOV in doses of ranging from 300,000 to 50 million plaque-forming units (PFU) or placebo. EBOV-specific antibody responses were detected in all the study participants with higher neutralizing antibody titers seen at higher doses of the vaccine (Agnandji et al. 2016) . The vaccine was also found to have significant rates of reactogenicity, with fever in 30% of vaccine recipients and vaccine-related arthritis in 22% of recipients at one center (Agnandji et al. 2016) . rVSV was detected in the blood of 95% of vaccinees, skin vesicles of two recipients and in the synovial fluid aspirate of an additional subject (Agnandji et al. 2016) . Contemporaneous to these studies, the rVSVDG-ZEBOV-GP group conducted two phase 1, placebo-controlled, trials of the same vaccine in the USA, at Walter Reed Medical Center and at the National Institutes of Health (Regules et al. 2017) . A total of 40 adults received the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine at a dose of 3 million or 20 million PFU. All vaccine recipients developed EBOV-specific antibodies, with recipients of the higher doses having statistically higher antibody titers and higher levels of neutralization (Regules et al. 2017) . Again, reactogenicity was very common with 55% of recipients reporting fevers and >75% reporting significant injection site pain (Regules et al. 2017) . rVSV viremia was found in all vaccinees, though no significant arthritis nor skin disease was reported in this study (Regules et al. 2017) . Given the concerns of arthritis from the previous studies, the VEBCON group developed a dose comparative study, evaluating 300,000 versus 10 million versus 50 million PFU dosages of the vaccine (Huttner et al. 2015) . As expected, EBOV-specific antibody titers and neutralizing titers were lower with the low-dose vaccine (Huttner et al. 2015) . Reactogenicity remained common even at the lower dose (88 vs. 98% in the higher doses), though fevers, chills, and myalgias were all significantly lower in the low-dose group. Importantly, the investigators found no significant reduction in the rates of vaccine-related arthritis or dermatitis (Huttner et al. 2015) . Taking these data together, the developers of this vaccine (NewLink Genetics [Ames, IA, USA] and Merck Sharp and Dohme [Kenilworth, NJ, USA]) moved forward trials of 20 million PFU dosage of the rVSV-ZEBOV, renamed V920.",

Then, a booster of modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vector (MVA-BN Filo; Bavarian Nordic), which encodes the same EBOV isolate glycoprotein antigen as that encoded by the ChAd3-EBOZ vaccine, in addition to glycoproteins of Sudan virus and Marburg virus and the nucleoprotein of TAFV, was given to 10 participants in each dose group. EBOV-specific antibody titers and neutralization activity were similar to those reported in rVSV-ZEBOV studies. The boosting with the MVA-BN Filo significantly increased EBOV-specific antibody and CD8+ T cell responses, although the antibody responses were more long lived (Ewer et al. 2016) . Overall, the vaccine was well tolerated (Ewer et al. 2016 ). In the combined data from two phase 1 dose-finding studies, one in the USA (n = 20) and the other in Mali (n = 91), with 52 of the Malians receiving MVA-BN-Filo boosters, the 1 billion viral particle dose was found to be the optimal dose in phase 3 efficacy trials (Tapia et al. 2016) . Currently, the ChAd3-EBOZ vaccine is being tested in several clinical trials and has been included as a comparator arm in the PREVAIL study (Partnership for Research on Ebola Virus in Liberia) evaluating rVSV-ZEBOV.",

In one outbreak in 1995, 25% of the infected were healthcare workers . The role of appropriate infection control precautions was demonstrated during this outbreak, as there were 80 infected healthcare workers prior to the implementation of appropriate barrier precautions, but only one additional case after barrier precautions were instituted. In the most recent 2014-2016 outbreak, there were 876 confirmed and probable cases of EBOV infection in healthcare workers of whom 509 died (WHO 2016) . Healthcare workers were between 21 and 32 times more likely to be infected with EBOV than people in the general adult population, and nearly 60% of those infected healthcare workers died. The importance of infection control in this setting was, as in the 1995 outbreak, demonstrated by the fact that healthcare workers represented 12% of all EVD patients in July 2014, but decreased to 1% by February 2015 as more rigorous infection control and occupational health and safety strategies were implemented. While the source of healthcare worker infection may be difficult to trace in locations where there is an ongoing community outbreak, such transmission is easier to identify when there is no ongoing community disease. The number of infected healthcare workers in resource-rich settings with no ongoing community disease was markedly less than the number in resource-constrained settings. However, one nurse in Spain and two nurses in the USA acquired EBOV infection from their patients who had acquired EBOV infection in West Africa. For these reasons, infection control has received a great deal of attention in the care of patients infected with Ebola viruses in both resource-rich and resource-constrained settings.",

However, in a study evaluating 31 environmental specimens from an EBOV isolation ward that were not visibly bloody, all specimens were negative by RT-PCR, suggesting that fomites in a clinical setting where cleaning and decontamination would be frequent are unlikely to be capable of EBOV transmission (Bausch et al. 2007) .

EBOV has been detected in seminal fluid for months following patient recovery (Uyeki et al. 2016a) . A secondary case has occurred following sexual exposure to semen 155 days after the source patient had cleared virus from his blood (Mate et al. 2015) . One case of uveitis was diagnosed with infectious virus in the aqueous humor 9 weeks after the patient had cleared his viremia . A nurse was diagnosed with meningitis, with recovery of EBOV from her cerebrospinal fluid, 9 months after clearing her viremia ). While such events are concerning, the role of such persistence in person-to-person transmission is still being evaluated. However, patients who have recovered from EBOV infection who require an invasive procedure of an immune-privileged site need to have special attention paid to the infection control measures followed during such a procedure. EBOV blood levels in infected patients increase rapidly during the first week after the onset of symptoms, going from undetectable to many log orders of virus (Towner et al. 2004) . During the most symptomatic period, viral levels in the blood may reach 10 8 virions per milliliter of blood (Iwen et al. 2015; CDC 2016a) , which is many logs higher than is seen with other blood borne pathogens. This helps to explain why individuals exposed to blood and body fluids of patients with Ebola infection during the early days of illness frequently do not become infected, while healthcare workers caring for the patient during the later stages of illness are at greatest risk. When this high viral load is added to the observation that symptomatic patients may excrete 8-10 L of infected fluid daily, one can readily understand why healthcare workers who do not use optimal PPE are at increased risk of occupationally acquired infection.",

In resource-constrained units, such equipment frequently consists of double gloving, impermeable suits, aprons, and surgical masks. In the absence of air conditioning, healthcare workers wearing such equipment are frequently limited to short periods of time in the patient care unit due to heat exhaustion, representing a challenge in the delivery of the aggressive supportive care required for optimal patient outcomes. Recommendations for PPE in resource-rich environments evolved rapidly in 2014. As the USA prepared for its first EBOV-infected patients in 2014, the official recommendation from the US Public Health Service was that healthcare workers should use standard contact precautions, with goggles or face shields, fluid resistant gowns, face masks, and gloves generally in use in healthcare facilities in the USA. Unfortunately, there was little emphasis on covering all skin surfaces and proper training in the use of PPE. The occurrence of EBOV infection in 2 nurses caring for a critically ill patient in October 2014 lead to a reconsideration of these recommendations. What evolved was a new appreciation for effective training and complete covering of all skin and mucous membranes when caring for a patient with Ebola virus infection. New guidelines stress: Healthcare workers caring for patients with EVD must have received comprehensive training and demonstrated competency in performing EVD-related infection control practices and procedures; PPE that covers the clothing and skin and completely protects mucous membranes is required when caring for patients with EVD; personnel providing care to patients with EVD must be supervised by an onsite manager at all times, and a trained observer must supervise each step of every PPE donning/doffing procedure to ensure established PPE protocols are completed correctly; individuals unable or unwilling to adhere to infection control and PPE use procedures should not provide care for patients with EVD (CDC 2016a). In addition, there is a renewed emphasis on frequent cleaning of the floors and surfaces in the patient room and doffing area. Policies should be in place to limit room entry to only those healthcare workers essential to the patient's care and restrict non-essential personnel and visitors from the patient care area. Such policies will need to balance any conflicts between healthcare worker safety and local work and union regulations.",

Consideration will also need to be given to whether the use of the equipment for the testing of blood in patients who may have serious communicable pathogens requires that equipment to be removed from service if the patient tests positive.

Eventually, contractors agreed to take the waste if it was first autoclaved prior to transport. However, even then such waste was transported separately from other regulated medical waste and only accepted for incineration in special facilities. For institutions that do not have the capability of autoclaving medical waste on site, contractors require that the waste be immersed in disinfectant inside 55-gallon metal drums, the drums sealed, and then transported by dedicated trucks to specially designated facilities (Stericycle). The expense of such special handling has been a major issue for patient care units. More recently, contractors have demonstrated a willingness to accept unit waste as standard regulated medical waste after it has been autoclaved. However, units without autoclave capability on site continue to be faced with logistic issues. All personnel who handle unit waste prior to autoclaving must be included in the unit PPE training.
