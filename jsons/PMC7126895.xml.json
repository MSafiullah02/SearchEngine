            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is an enveloped, positive-strand RNA virus of Gamma coronavirus which infects chickens. It causes avian infectious bronchitis (IB), which is an acute highly contagious disease with severe economic losses in poultry industry worldwide [1]. IBV has a large number of genotypes and in China, 19 strains are isolated during 2011\u20132012. Infected chickens develop respiratory symptoms, coughing, sneezing, depression, nasal discharge, kidney, gonads, reduced egg production, poor egg quality and death. In recent year, nephropathogenic IBVs have become prevalent genotypes in China [2], new nephropathogenic isolates induce more severe lesions to kidney and show high mortality in young chickens [3]. Currently only IBV Beaudette strain can replicate in HD11 [4] or Vero [5] cell lines. Several recent works have proved the induction of apoptosis and suppression of immune response are related to the pathogenicity of nephropathogenic IBVs [6,7]. However, the key factor for these process during infection are still unclear.",

Post infection of IBVs can encode miRNAs or influence the expression levels of cellular miRNAs [10,11]. miRNAs have been reported to play an important role in virus pathogenesis such as miR-122, which may be able to stabilize the HCV genomic RNA [12], and the immune response related miRNAs such as miR-130a, miR-155, miR-23b miR-146a-5p which can help the virus to augment its replication or in evasion of cellular immune response [[13], [14], [15]].",

In our previous study, we have described the transcriptome of chicken kidneys infected with nephropathogenic IBVs at mRNA and miRNA level. Chicken kidney infected with three nephropathogenic IBV with different virulence revealed the differentially expressed genes and miRNAs [6,16]. Among them, most of the differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs are related to immune response, cell apoptosis, DNA replication and metabolic pathways [6]. 58 differentially expressed miRNAs are considered responsible for the differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs. As we described several of these miRNAs are in accordance with the virus titers in each group, revealing that they may serve as determinants of the pathogenicity of nephropathogenic IBVs.",

In addition, we tested the growth curve of Beaudette in HD11 cells in the post transfection of miR-146a. As shown in Fig. 2b & c, high levels of miR-146a-5p can promote the replication of Beaudette at the early stage post infection, subsequently it was increased to 4-fold of virus genome at 8 h period. The virus titer peaked at 32 h, and the time of cytopathic effects reduced to 33 h when compared to 36 h of untreated cells (control).

Hence, we investigated the expression levels of these 8 genes (Fig. 3\na) in HD11 and Vero cells transfected with miR-146a-5p mimics (Fig. 3a). Expression analysis results showed the down regulations of TNFRSF18 and IRAK2 compared to control cells.

A study of differences of dynamic distribution between nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains such as SAIBK, M41 and H120 in SPF chicken exhibited that the kidney and the lung were the most sensitive organs in IBV infection [22].

In VSV model, it targets TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), IL-1 receptor associated kinase-1 (IRAK1) and IRAK 2 genes. In the present study, we described IRAK 2 as a target for miR-146a-5p in IBV model. In addition, for the first time it was found that TNFRSF18 was a target of miR-146a. However, the expression level of TNFRSF18 was relatively low, the function of TNFRSF18 is need to be further characterization. On the other hand, we found Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 2 (LRP2) was down regulated by miR-146a-5p during the infection of virulent IBV. Down regulation of LRP2 has been reported leading to cell apoptosis in Alzheimer \u2019s disease. Similarly, miR-146a-5p was also reported target in enterovirus 71-induced cell apoptosis.

In this study, we found that miR-146a-5p increased the replication of IBV by induced down-regulation of IRAK2. IRAK2 is also involved in TLR signaling and type I interferon production.
