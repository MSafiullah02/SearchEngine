The overall term for this is cybersecurity, which was referred to in the past as Information Assurance.1 Scarcely a day passes without a major news report on computer crime or other incident, from things as basic as defacing Web sites to identity theft, crippling virus attacks, diverted bank accounts, ransomware , and compromise of sensitive operational data and intellectual property. Systems with large numbers of users, geographically distributed locations, and networked access are especially vulnerable. Security professionals, many of whom have specialized training and hold credentials like Certified Information Systems Security Professional ( CISSP) , fight a never-ending battle to defeat criminals, hackers, terrorists, foreign intelligence services, and deranged people who derive perverse satisfaction from releasing viruses, Trojans, worms, and other \u201cmalware.\u201d Even a system with robust safeguards against external attack may be vulnerable to the \u201cinsider threat\u201d from personnel with authorized access who have become disaffected, have taken money from a criminal or hostile agency, or are simply poorly trained and careless. Any organization or enterprise that relies on information processing is a potential target, and the reality is that most systems of any size or significance have already been penetrated. Figure 10.1 suggests the range of threats confronting secure systems.\n",

A few examples from recent reports on cyberattacks and data breaches will serve to highlight the challenge [1].Common estimates are that the number of new threats is doubling every year, and the global cost of data breaches is measured in trillions of dollars per year.Many, perhaps most, common attacks could be defeated with available and affordable safeguards that victims simply fail to deploy; as an example, the average time from publication of a software patch or other mitigation to close a newly discovered vulnerability to the actual installation of the protective measure by both private and public sector organizations is months or even years, when it should be hours or days.The top ten system vulnerabilities account for approximately 85% of data breaches; some have been around for as long as several years but continue to be exploited.Roughly 80% of successful attacks originate with external threat agents, but the majority also involve either deliberate or accidental actions by \u201cinsiders,\u201d i.e., members or employees of the victimized organization; a common example is an attack that starts with \u201cphishing\u201d to trick an insider into revealing information or downloading malware, giving the attacker access to the system.A cybersecurity provider recently reported that ten out of ten mobile devices and applications used for payments at stores, theaters, hotels, etc. had major security weaknesses such as failing to encrypt Social Security Numbers.Relatively new and more sophisticated threats are proliferating; one such is a \u201c ransomware\u201d attack in which a criminal attacker encrypts a victim\u2019s databases and demands payment to restore them.Online security across the board is so bad that most successful hackers don\u2019t actually need to employ hacking methods; they simply enter the victim\u2019s network through unprotected public interfaces .\n",

Cybersecurity is therefore a balancing act involving an adequate level of protection against known or postulated threats while still allowing systems and their users to carry out their legitimate functions and accomplish their business objectives or operational missions. For example, a classic dilemma facing a security architect today is the unanticipated user, an external party who is not known to a system a priori, and may very well not even be physically located at the system, but who nevertheless has permissions granted by a higher authority to access functions and data. The security design must then ensure that such legitimate users are granted access, while imposters are blocked with acceptably low error rates.",

A typical security architecture begins with the most thorough analysis possible of the sources and methods of system attack. The security architect then follows an orderly process of selecting and applying protective measures while ensuring that a system can still accomplish its purpose with acceptable impacts on performance, cost, reliability, and long-term evolution. Security design often uses products with defined assurance levels and employs design patterns, security protocols, and standards to achieve an acceptable level of security risk. This chapter describes a typical security architecture process and introduces some terminology and design approaches. The objective is to enable a general system architect to appreciate the dimensions of the security challenge, to interact more effectively with security specialists, and to ensure compliance with security policies . There are frequent references to Department of Defense (DoD) security policies and practices both because of the importance of protecting classified information and because much of the security technology and many standards and implementation methods, which are used throughout information technology (IT) systems, derive from the experience and investments of the Defense community.",

Figure 10.2 is a graphical portrayal of the main elements of a cyberattack and introduces some standard terms. An Asset is any information, process, or other system content that requires protection. Assets are potentially at risk if the system has that an attacker can exploit. Collectively, these vulnerabilities constitute the system\u2019s , and a primary goal of secure architecture is to minimize this. An asset such as a database typically has that are the specific items sought by an attacker. A is created by a Threat Agent who seeks to exploit a vulnerability to steal, corrupt, delete, or otherwise harm an asset. Then if the system has safeguards, properly called Security Controls , that adequately mitigate the vulnerability, the asset is protected; otherwise, there can be an Exposure or data breach.

Intelligence agencies typically require more stringent control and protection for their information, which is often achieved through \u201ccompartments\u201d that have very strict access requirements and higher levels of physical, administrative, and technical security measures. Civil agencies and commercial enterprises typically define sensitivity levels, e.g., Restricted, Confidential, Private, etc., for information such as intellectual property, personal and financial data, strategic planning, and compliance with laws governing information protection.

These can range from property fences and controlled access points to alarms and locked equipment enclosures .Procedural measures \u2013 these deal with secure operations and practices aimed at maintaining the effectiveness of security controls and eliminating vulnerabilities caused by human error. A typical example is a requirement to erase sensitive software and data from a computer at the completion of a work period or task. Others include automatic locking of computers after a period of inactivity and regular, timely system scans to detect suspicious behavior or altered system configurations. Such procedures may be documented in an Automated Information System (AIS) directive.

Cybersecurity requirements, functions, and standards will impact many aspects of the system and may be the dominant factor in decisions such as product selections.

Regardless of whether a system has a Government or a private customer, adequate testing must be planned and conducted as an integral part of the total test program. Ultimately, a body of evidence is presented to an appropriate authority to support an approval to operate decision. This is further discussed under System and Component Trust Evaluation below.Monitoring, Maintenance, and Upgrading  \u2013 during system operation, provide the resources and procedures for monitoring functions such as event logging, configuration audits, and vulnerability testing. Since technology, requirements, and threats continuously evolve, even the best security architecture and implementation will require periodic updating and retesting to maintain assurance that the required risk level is still being met. Plans for long-term system support and upgrading need to account for the inevitable updates and problem fixes associated with system security components and functions. Specific activities in this area include:Configuration management to protect against unknown or unapproved contentPrompt installation of software patches as soon as released to deal with new vulnerabilitiesTechnology refreshment as cybersecurity components, like any other products, evolve, become obsolescent, and require replacement or upgradingAddition, upgrading, or reconfiguration of protective measures to deal with new or changing threats and policiesEducation, training, and security awareness of personnel to ensure the human element of the cybersecurity posture does not degrade as personnel and system functions change \n\n  \u2013 as shown in Fig. 10.5, implement governance at every step and throughout a system\u2019s lifetime. Valuable guidance is provided in NIST Special Publication 800-100 [13], which is targeted to Government agencies and policies but provides useful insight for private security architects and managers as well; Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-95669-5_3 is especially relevant to secure system development. This document stresses the importance of clear individual and organizational roles and responsibilities, regular monitoring of security features and policy compliance, periodic reassessment of the effectiveness of security controls and procedures using measurements and metrics, rigorous configuration management and change control, and continuous analysis of incidents, supported by auditing of system logs.\n",

A DMZ can be implemented with one or two firewalls, the latter being more secure.

In a typical situation, a user would request access to an application or data set, and the PEP would obtain the user\u2019s certificate and other attributes (see Access Control below); would apply current policy, provided by a Policy Definition Point ( PDP) , to determine if the requested access is allowed; and, if so, would authorize the requested activity.

The Kerberos protocol, defined in RFC 4120 from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), is the most common standard for mutual authentication between computers [18]. A Digital Certificate (or Public Key Certificate) is a document that binds a public key to one or more identification attributes of the key issuer, who may be the recipient of secure messaging or the client of a service provider. An enterprise can create a PKI that provides for issuing authentication credentials, such as an identity card with an embedded electronic certificate, to participants and can provide services such as certificate revocation if a credential is withdrawn or compromised, using a Certificate Revocation List (CRL). An alternative to PKI is called a Web of Trust scheme in which individual participants in an enterprise digitally sign their own certificates which are then attested by a third party. A popular implementation of this approach is Pretty Good Privacy ( PGP) , which allows use of email digital signatures and lets participants publish their public keys. A Web of Trust can interoperate with a PKI if all parties trust the Certificate Authority. Multiple CAs can be used to create a distributed ledger of certificates. Certificates can be used as part of a Non-Repudiation implementation, e.g., by using proof-of-origin and proof-of-receipt, as evidence that an individual participated in a transaction.

Access control can be centralized for a system or enterprise as a whole, or decentralized, e.g., at the level of individual enclaves.

An approach that is growing in popularity is to create a virtual computing environment that matches the actual system but is completely separate from it, commonly labeled a \u201csandbox.\u201d This allows software to be hosted and thoroughly tested before it is deployed in the production environment and to be retested as necessary in response to newly discovered vulnerabilities without disrupting operations. Continuous monitoring is also helped by the availability of increasingly sophisticated tools for analyzing network traffic patterns, event logs, and other indicators. A sandbox can be used in conjunction with a honeypot or honeynet to perform forensics such as identifying an attacker.",

The CC structure allows security requirements for an item to be specified in a way that allows a product to be tested against them. Security requirements for a class of devices are captured in a Protection Profile (PP), and one or more PPs are used in compiling a Security Target (ST) that defines the security properties of a product and a set of Security Functional Requirements (SFRs). PPs are oriented toward allowing users to define their needs, while STs allow providers to spell out the security their products provide.

The highest levels can consume so much time and money that products are either not economically feasible to evaluate or approaching obsolescence when the process is complete, which is one of the major criticisms of CC. Government agencies typically mandate an EAL for a component of a secure system based on the sensitivity of the information being protected and the nature of the threat [34]. For example, information whose compromise would cause some damage (roughly equivalent to a classification of Confidential or Company Private) and that faces a threat characterized as unsophisticated but willing to take risks (perhaps a basic hacker) warrants an EAL of 2. Information whose compromise would cause exceptionally severe damage (e.g., a classification of Top Secret or key intellectual property) with a sophisticated adversary who has reasonable resources and will take significant risks (perhaps a major terrorist organization) calls for an EAL of 6, which many commercial products cannot meet.

Artifacts exported from such a model can be focused on specific aspects such as security features and functions and can effectively provide the information needed by security testers, analysts, and accreditation authorities. For example, architecture data can support planning of effective vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.An architecture model allows rigorous and auditable flowdown of requirements, including security requirements, to components, interfaces, and processes, to ensure all requirements have been accounted for in system design and to provide a basis for requirements verification and validation.As service-oriented architecture (SOA) becomes the preferred approach to implementing large information systems and enterprises, the power of architecture modeling in defining services and, especially, service interfaces is invaluable in system accreditation involving security services, both for internal services and for those a system provides or consumes as a participant in a larger enterprise.An architecture model provides a basis for configuration management, data management, and change management. For example, a model captures dependencies among system elements to support defining required regression testing following a design change. The model also serves as a searchable repository of system and component information, including functions such as archiving data from previous security testing to keep subsequent testing to the feasible minimum.Modern system architecture modeling tools allow simulation of behavioral diagrams to visualize the processes that they represent.

Typical measures include security screening and intensive education of staff and access controls to prevent support personnel from reaching client data.Similarly, a CSP must provide physical security to ensure a data center is difficult or impossible to penetrate. Reliable electrical power, for example, using uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs), and environmental controls are also important to ensure against data loss.In any secure system, data at rest should be encrypted. This is especially important in a cloud.Access controls should be controlled only by the cloud client or data owner. It\u2019s highly desirable that the CSP support fine-grained user privileges so that access can be finely matched to individual users. The CSP should provide and maintain logging of all access attempts.The CSP must have an adequate plan for data backup and recovery and for business continuity.Encryption is important to protect cloud transactions over open networks, for data protection and for security of user data, logs, and other sensitive information. Advanced encryption algorithms used in cloud environments include various types of Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) in which a set of attributes of the ciphertext and of the user\u2019s secret key must match before decryption can be performed.Compliance with applicable laws and regulations may be different in a cloud environment than with a system controlled by the using organization. An example is the approach used for data locating. A cloud services client must be aware of any such differences and take steps to ensure compliance .\n",
