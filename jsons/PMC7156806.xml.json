This may also relate to a lack of availability of testing, guidelines limiting testing, and an under-appreciation of the benefits of routine testing around the world. However, the large number of respondents who had already modified their outpatient practices to reduce their patients\u2019 exposure shows that important actions have already been undertaken, and that there is an awareness of the need to help protect individuals who may be vulnerable to infection. This is an important issue to consider, as the hallmark of inpatient rehabilitation facilities has been rehabilitation participants coming together in gyms and dining areas to join in community. Individuals with COVID-19 can spread the disease before symptoms occur, therefore we advocate for the routine testing of individuals that are newly admitted to or currently in rehabilitation facilities and for use of personal protective equipment (PPE) on all individuals with SCI until test results are available. Visitors to rehabilitation facilities also ought to routinely use PPE.",

This pandemic highlights the need to advocate for people with SCI/D and other disabilities as we adapt to an increasing worldwide population, climate change, and more frequent zoonoses and disasters.
