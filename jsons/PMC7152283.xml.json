Furthermore, veterinarians should develop formal infection control plans, identify common case scenarios (e.g., diarrhea, respiratory disease) in which antimicrobial drugs are often employed, develop antimicrobial use protocols for their practice, and categorize all antibiotics in primary, secondary, and tertiary use categories, besides appropriate diagnostic and sensitivity measures. Monitoring and surveillance for trends in the prevalence of resistant bacteria within a practice, a farm, a region, or a nation permits continual evaluation of antimicrobial drug use on various levels.",

Diarrhea in preweaned calves is by far the leading cause of mortality in dairy heifer calves with no change in mortality rates between 1995 and 2001 in the United States.2 Despite the widespread availability of vaccines against enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, rotavirus, and coronavirus, as well as continued emphasis on optimizing colostral transfer of passive immunity, the oral and parenteral administration of antimicrobial agents continues to play an important role in the treatment of calf diarrhea.3., 4., 5., 6., 7. Evidence-based recommendations for the administration of antimicrobial agents in diarrheic calves were recently developed based on a systematic review of randomized controlled studies published in peer-reviewed journals.8., 9. This chapter is based on those recommendations and the results of recent studies on the use of antimicrobials in calves with diarrhea during the first few weeks in life (preweaning period). For a complete historic background and reference list of antimicrobial use in the treatment of calf diarrhea, the reader is referred to these reviews.8., 9.\n",

In many herds several agents are usually present and can be detected in neonatal calves with and without diarrhea. If calf diarrhea occurs in an outbreak situation with high morbidity, Salmonella bacteria may be involved. Regardless of the etiology, calves with diarrhea often have increased coliform bacterial numbers in the small intestine and this colonization is associated with altered small intestinal function, morphologic damage, and increased susceptibility to bacteremia.9 The importance of bacterial overgrowth in calf diarrhea recently gained attention when the role of D-lactic acid in the development of acidemia in calves with diarrhea was identified. Production of D-lactic acid results from bacterial fermentation in the gastrointestinal tract and is a common finding in neonatal calves with and without diarrhea.10., 11., 12. D-lactic acid is a major component of acidemia in diarrheic calves13., 14., 15. and is accompanied by systemic signs of weakness and ataxia.16\n",

Bacteremia, predominantly with E. coli, is present in approximately 20% to 30% of calves with diarrhea or systemic illness.17., 18., 19. The frequency of bacteremia is considered sufficiently high that treatment of calves with diarrhea that are severely ill (as manifest by reduced suckle reflex, >6% dehydration, weakness, inability to stand, or clinical depression) should include routine treatment against bacteremia, with emphasis on treating potential E. coli bacteremia. A clinical sepsis score to predict bacteremia is not recommended to guide antibiotic treatment decisions until further validation of the score in different calf-rearing scenarios.20 Bacteremia should be suspected to be present in all calves with clinical signs of Salmonella diarrhea, although the prevalence of bacteremia in affected calves has not been determined.21\n",

Susceptibility results obtained from dead calves should be interpreted carefully because isolates obtained from dead calves are likely to be obtained from treatment failures, and calves that died from diarrhea are likely to have bacterial overgrowth in the intestines and many organs not representing the in vivo situation. Another concern with fecal susceptibility testing is that the Kirby Bauer break points (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]) are not based on typical antimicrobial concentrations in the small intestine and blood of calves.

Antimicrobials that bypass the rumen are not thought to alter rumen microflora, potentially permitting bacterial recolonization of the small intestine from the rumen. The normal intestinal flora is always exposed to varying amounts of antimicrobial drugs regardless of the type of administration.1 Historic studies reported that some orally administered antibiotics (e.g., potassium and procaine penicillin, neomycin sulfate, ampicillin trihydrate, tetracycline hydrochloride) may increase the incidence of diarrhea, produce malabsorption, and reduce growth rate.9\n",

Oral amoxicillin trihydrate (10 mg/kg, q12h for 4 days) was efficacious in decreasing mortality rate and duration of diarrhea in two studies where diarrhea was experimentally induced with enterotoxigenic E. coli bacteria.22., 23. The absorption rate of amoxicillin trihydrate from the calf small intestine is 30% when administered in milk.27 High amoxicillin concentrations are present in the bile and intestinal contents, with lower antimicrobial concentrations in serum.21 Feeding of amoxicillin with milk does not change the bioavailability of amoxicillin, although amoxicillin is absorbed faster when dissolved in an oral electrolyte solution than in milk replacer.28 Amoxicillin absorption is slowed during endotoxemia, presumably because of a decrease in abomasal emptying rate.29 Amoxicillin trihydrate is preferred to ampicillin trihydrate for oral administration in calves because it is labeled for the treatment of calf diarrhea in the United States and is absorbed to a much greater extent.27., 28., 30. However, a field study comparing equal amounts (400 mg, q12h) of oral amoxicillin and ampicillin for the treatment of diarrhea reported similar proportions of calves with a good to excellent clinical response.31 The addition of clavulanate potassium to amoxicillin trihydrate is recommended because clavulanate potassium is a potent irreversible inhibitor of \u03b2-lactamase, increasing the antimicrobial spectrum of activity.",

Oxytetracycline in combination with neomycin followed by oxytetracycline alone are the most common medications.6 Several studies reported inconsistent results of the effects of antibiotics containing milk replacer on the incidence of diarrhea (scours). The incidence of diarrhea was not influenced when antibiotics in milk replacer were compared with oligosaccharides or bovine plasma as nonantibiotic alternative treatments.35., 36., 37. A more extensive recent study found that the onset and overall morbidity of important diseases in calves during their first weeks of life (diarrhea, respiratory disease, navel infection) were significantly lower in calves receiving antibiotics neomycin sulphate (22 mg/kg/day) and tetracycline HCl (22 mg/kg/day) in milk replacer than in control calves without in-feed antibiotics.38 This study did not exclusively consider diarrhea as the primary outcome, but the findings are valuable because they reflect the pattern of diseases in newborn calves in a specialized calf-rearing facility with high disease incidence in a stressful environment.",

The administration of a single dose of flunixin meglumine (2.2 mg/kg [1 mg/lb] IM) as an adjunct treatment for naturally occurring diarrhea resulted in fewer morbid-days and antimicrobial treatments only when calves had fecal blood in their feces.41 In calves with experimentally induced enterotoxigenic E. coli infection, flunixin meglumine (2.2 mg/kg [1 mg/lb] q8h IM) reduced fecal output perhaps by acting as an antisecretory agent.42 Flunixin meglumine (2.2 mg/kg [1 mg/lb] q12h) is indicated in severely sick calves with presumed endotoxemia when hydration status is adequate to prevent nephrotoxicity. A rule of thumb is to administer flunixin meglumine once at a dose 2.2 mg/kg (1 mg/lb) and not to exceed three doses of flunixin meglumine for the treatment of diarrhea and respiratory disease to avoid potential damage of the intestinal mucosa of the abomasum, especially in intensive calf-rearing facilities with a history of case fatalities from perforated abomasal ulcers. An important effect of flunixin meglumine administration is the clinical impression that calves show a better suckle behavior after therapy. This impression is supported by a recent statement that \u201cthe use of flunixin meglumine is valuable in improving the well-being of the calves.\u201d38\n",
