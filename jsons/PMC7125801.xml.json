Scientist found that outside the hematopoietic system, APN was widely expressed on various kinds of cells. For example, epithelial cells of the intestine and kidney, hepatocytes, osteoclasts, endometrial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, bone marrow stromal cells and on neuronal synaptic membranes. APN is involved in many physiology and pathology processes such as hydrolysis of nutrients, inactivation of bioactive peptides, binding of corona viruses, mediating cytomegalovirus infection and antigen presentation. Furthermore, APN has been a target for anti-tumor agents due to its important functions in ECM degradation, tumor cells invasion and tumor angiogenesis.1, 2, 3\n",

The binding sites of APN with bestatin can be divided to three parts. Part 1 is a hydrophobic pocket (S1); part 2 is the zinc binding group (ZBG); part 3 is another hydrophobic pocket in the other side (S1\u2032).",

Also in 2008, the crystal structures of Escherichia coli amino-peptidase N (e PepN) in complex with l-arginine, l-lysine, l-phenylalanine, l-tyrosine and l-tryptophan have been determined to understand the structural basis for APN\u2019s hydrolysis pattern. The result showed that all these amino acids bind with their backbone atoms close to the active-site zinc ion and their side chain occupying the S1 pocket of e PepN. And the specificity of the S1-binding pocket suggest that the preferred amino acid is, in decreasing order, arginine, lysine, tyrosine and phenylalanine.17 Additionally, arginine is similar with lysine in structure except the guanidinium group and the longer carbon chain. According to the former reasons, we choose l-arginine as the starting material in order to get more efficient and potential APN inhibitors. The compounds designed are showed in Figure 1.",

This possibly descript from the differences between the structures of two enzymes, leading to different requirements for their respective inhibitors. APN is a membrane-bound zinc exopeptidase that catalyzed the removal of NH2-terminal amino acid from the peptide, while MMP-2 is a zinc-dependent endopeptidase that could cut the peptide to parts from the specific amino acid residue of the peptide.

The docking study performed using Sybyl/FlexX module, the residues in a radius of 7.0 \u00c5 around Bestatin in the co-crystal structure (PDB code: 2DQM) were selected as the active site. Other docking parameters implied in the program were kept default. From Figure 2\n, we can see the backbone of 5s inserted to S1 pocket, the hydroxymate of 5s interacted with the zinc ion of APN and the 4-bromo-3-nitro benzamide side chain extended to S1\u2032 pocket.",
