The reports originate from national laws, according to which positive test findings must be submitted to the Federal Health Authorities, the Robert Koch Institute, via the local health authorities. Since an enormous number of unreported cases can be expected, the question of how widespread the disease has been in the population cannot be answered based on these administrative reports. Using mathematical modeling, however, estimates can be made. These estimates indicate that the small numbers of diagnostic tests carried out at the beginning of the outbreak overlooked considerable parts of the infection. In order to cover the initial phase of future waves of the disease, wide-spread and comprehensive tests are recommended.",

The numbers of cases were based on the positive results reported according to the Infection Protection Act (\"Infektionsschutzgesetz\", IfSG) of the diagnostic tests carried out throughout Germany for the novel coranavirus SARS-CoV-2. The number of tests carried out was based on regional characteristics, availability of test kits and laboratory capacities. The frequency of the tests carried out increased during the epidemic [RKI 2020] . Together with the fact that several people with the associated COVID disease show only asymptomatic or mild courses and presumably have not been tested at any time, the variable frequency of the tests leads to the hypothesis that the actual disease process was at least partially underestimated.",

If the mortality of the susceptible people is negligible (for COVID it is), we have following system of differential equations(A3)Here, \uf062 is the rate of making an efficient contact (per time unit) and r is rate at which infectious people leave the infectious state (due to recovery or death). Let N = S + I + R, then we have \uf062 = R 0 r / N, where R 0 is the basic reproduction number [Vynnycky 2010 ]. Insertion into (A2) yields dI/dt = r I (R 0 S/N \uf02d 1). As R eff = R 0 S/N, we have Equation (1).As F t = S(t) \uf02d S(t + \uf044) can be approximated by \uf02d\uf044 dS/dt (Taylor's Theorem), Equation (A1) and \uf062 = R 0 r / N yields F t \uf0bb \uf044 \uf062 I S = \uf044 R eff r I, which is Equation (3).",
