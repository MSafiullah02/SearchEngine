Recently, we reported the tentative mechanism for the formation of \u03b1-bromo-\u03b1-fluoro-\u03b2-lactams by Et2Zn-promoted Reformatsky-type reaction of 1 with imine in Et2O.6 There, chemo- and diastereoselective formation of 3a was achieved by the addition of stable (Z)-zinc bromofluoroenolate (6) to imine, where low coordination power of Et2O makes the generation of chair-like transition state favorable. Intramolecular cyclization of intermediate (7) to ester carbonyl group was promoted by the intramolecular coordination of zinc to carbonyl moiety to give 3a.6 On the other hand, the strongly coordinating solvent, CH3CN, could coordinate with Zn of the enolate 8 leading to reversible equilibrium of E/Z isomer of 8. And also the coordination could destroy the chair-like transition state to give another open-chain transition state (TS-1\u2013TS-4). The Reformatsky adduct (9) gave the aziridine ring 4a via aza-Darzens-type intramolecular cyclization, where coordination of solvent to Zn of 9 seemed to disturb the activation of ester carbonyl moiety. This assumption was supported that the mixture of 3a and 4a was obtained by the reaction of 1 with imine (2a) using Et2Zn and Et2O as a solvent in the presence of PPh3 which must be a better monovalent ligand than CH3CN.13 In this transition model, the syn isomer is obtained mainly from TS-1, in which there is little steric repulsion. On the other hand, other transition states (TS-2\u2013TS-4) have some steric repulsion between bromine and phenyl group and between phenyl group and the other functional group. Z-8 used for TS-1 might be provided from equilibrium of E-8 and Z-8. As a result, the selective generation of syn isomer was achieved by dynamic kinetic resolution.",
