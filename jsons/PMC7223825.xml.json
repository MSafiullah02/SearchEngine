Virulence factors are essential for the invading bacteria to colonize, invade host cells, adapt to various environments in the host, subvert host functions, and overcome the defenses of the host (Martens and Demain 2017). Invasins and intimins are members of virulence factors secreted by gram-negative pathogens. Currently, many invasins and intimins have been identified in pathogens including Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Yersinia pestis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Hafnia alvei, etc. (Leo et al. 2015; Chauhan et al. 2016), which played a crucial role in their attachment and invasion to intestinal epithelial cells (Oberhettinger et al. 2012; Tsai et al. 2010). These pathogens can intimately adhere to the colonic epithelium of the host and form a pedestal-like structure, disrupting the microvilli on the enterocyte surface. Intimins bind with its receptor Tir with high affinity, resulting in actin reorganization in the host cell (Leo et al. 2012; Gillenius and Urban 2015; Heinz et al. 2016). Tir is synthesized by the pathogen itself, and injected into the host cell via T3SS in advance. Invasins, however, directly bind to the host receptor \u03b21 integrins, triggering the re-arrangement of the host cell cytoskeleton to help with pathogen invasion (Leo et al. 2012; Isberg and van Nhieue 1995).",

Both invasins and intimins are mainly composed of four parts: signal peptide, periplasmic domain, translocation domain, and passenger domain (Leo et al. 2015). Signal peptide (SP), located at the N-terminus of the protein, mediates its transport and secretion through the Sec secretion system (Leo et al. 2015). Periplasmic domain, referred as the \u03b1-domain, links the \u03b2-barrel domain. In addition, the lysin motif (LysM) in the periplasmic domain could bind to peptidoglycan under low pH conditions (Buist et al. 2010). The \u03b2-barrel and the linker region constitute the translocation domain, which is the transmembrane region and can stabilize the membrane due to \u03b1-helical structures (Sadana et al. 2018). The passenger domain of invasins/intimins consists of a series of immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains (Batchelor et al. 2000).",

ATs have N-terminal passenger domain and C-terminal \u03b2-barrel domain, while IATs are opposite (Leibiger et al. 2019; Van Ulsen et al. 2018). Type V secretion system is the most common secretion system of gram-negative pathogens, which could be divided into five subtypes (Va\u2013Ve). Type Va systems are classical ATs; type Vb systems are two-partner secretion systems since the passenger domain and the translocation domain are two separate protein chains but are expressed from the same operon structure; type Vc systems are trimeric ATs; type Vd systems are recently described and similar to type Va systems; type Ve systems are IATs. Besides the inversion of passenger and \u03b2-barrel domains, type Ve systems also have a small peripheral domain at the N-terminus of the polypeptide chain. In some cases it contains a peptidoglycan-binding motif (Fan et al. 2016).",

            "text": "Edwardsiella piscicida, phylogenetically close to other model enteric pathogens such as pathogenic E. coli, Shigella and Salmonella species (Yang et al. 2012), is a bacterial pathogen with broad host (Xiao et al. 2008). E. piscicida mainly affects freshwater and marine animals, causing edwardsiellosis in over 20 fish species and resulting in large economic losses in the aquaculture industry worldwide (Leotta et al. 2009; Green 2010; Park et al. 2012; Leung et al. 2019). In our previous study, sequencing of the complete genome of a typical highly virulent E. piscicida strain EIB202 was accomplished (Wang et al. 2009). The genomics study revealed that E. piscicida harbored both type III and type VI secretion systems (T3SS and T6SS) (Tan et al. 2002; Srinivasa Rao et al. 2003; Zheng et al. 2005; Leung et al. 2012; Gao et al. 2015; Okuda et al. 2009). In E. piscicida, T3SS and T6SS are identified as two of the most important virulence mechanisms which are essential for bacterial internalization, survival and replication inside host cells (Srinivasa Rao et al. 2004). T3SS mutation or T6SS mutation which abolishes the secretion ability results in severely impaired cell invasion capabilities (Yang et al. 2015). The gene cluster of the T3SS in E. piscicida includes 34 genes, mainly encoding translocon proteins (EseB, EseC, and EseD), chaperones (EscA, EscB and EscC), effectors (EseG, EseH, EseJ, EseK), regulators (EsrA, EsrB and EsrC) and apparatus (EsaB, EsaN). T3SS forms syringe-like structure, and relies on translocon proteins to translocate effectors into the host cell (Wei et al. 2018). It has been reported recently that the balanced role of T3SS and T6SS are required to achieve full virulence (Hu et al. 2019).",

            "text": "As one of the core secretion systems for E. piscicida to invade host cells, up-stream mediators of T3SS have rarely been explored. Previously we constructed the Himar1 transposon insertion mutant library of E. piscicida (Wei et al. 2019), in which each mutant has a random but defined transposon insertion locus. Here we performed autoaggregation assay with this library to screen for up-stream T3SS mediators. The rationale for autoaggregation assay is explained in Fig. 1a. EseB is a T3SS translocon component in E. piscicida which can form filamentous appendages on the surface of E. piscicida and facilitate bacterial adhesion to an abiotic surface (Gao et al. 2015). During screening, autoaggregation assay was performed in 96-well plates and the small amount of medium volume in each well caused some extent of bacterial sedimentation (Fig. 1b, white plaque in the middle, referred as \u201cbutton\u201d). When T3SS is complete, the secreted EseB mediates the adhesion and clump of all bacterial cells. The weight makes them settle down to the bottom (forming \u201ccarpet\u201d, fuzzing up the white plaque). However, when T3SS is disrupted, no EseB will be secreted. Therefore, cells will not clump and the bottom will be clear (\u201cbutton\u201d only). As a result, the transposon insertion mutant of the ETAE_0323 gene (ETAE_0323::Tn) showed dramatic T3SS defect (Fig. 1b). The autoaggregation phenotype was also confirmed in test tubes. Aggregation look in test tubes was slightly different from that in 96-well plates. Because of the larger medium volume in test tubes, natural sedimentation did not happen. Bacteria settled down to the bottom with a functional T3SS, and left the bottom clear when T3SS was disrupted. As shown in Fig. 1c, ETAE_0323::Tn displayed the same autoaggregation phenotype with the \u0394esrB strain, with much fewer cells accumulated at the bottom. EsrB is a key regulator of T3/T6SS in E. piscicida which plays a crucial role in E. piscicida pathogenicity (Liu et al. 2017). In addition, we collected and concentrated the extracellular proteins (ECPs) for SDS-PAGE. Compared with WT, \u0394esrB strain showed defect on the ECPs from both T3SS (EseB, EseC, and EseD) and T6SS (EvpI, EvpP, and EvpC). Interestingly, the transposon mutant ETAE_0323::Tn abolished the secretion through T3SS but had an unaffected T6SS (Fig. 1d, e), suggesting that ETAE_0323 may specifically activate T3SS.",

Autoaggregation assays were then performed again (Fig. 3a). Unlikely the transposon mutant inV::Tn, N-terminus and C-terminus deletion of inV did not affect the phenotype of autoaggregation. To further examine the influence of InV to T3SS, EseB levels were measured in both ECPs and WCPs since it was the major elemental protein of T3SS. As shown by Fig. 3b, EseB secretion rather than expression was disrupted in the transposon mutant inV::Tn. However, InV deletion did not affect EseB secretion, as well as expression (lane 4 and lane 5 in Fig. 3b). In addition, qRT-PCR data suggested that the deletion of InV had no influence on T3SS transcription (Fig. 3c). Taken together, these results demonstrate that InV protein itself affects neither secretion nor expression of T3SS.",

InV-N\u2032 levels were detected in WCPs, ECPs, cytoplasma proteins (Cyto), and membrane proteins (Mem) through Flag antibody to reveal its localization. According to Fig. 3d (left 4 lanes), in WT cells a majority of InV-N\u2032 fragment was located on the membrane with a little bit in cytosol as well, suggesting that InV was a membrane protein. In addition, no InV-N\u2032 was secreted out of cells (ECPs). The membrane localization of InV-N\u2032 was partially affected by T3SS, however, not significantly when compared with DnaK control (Fig. 3d, right 4 lanes). These data suggest that InV may not have strong relationship with T3SS, and the T3SS depletion phenotypes of inV::Tn may be caused by polar effect.",

We also examined the InV-N\u2032 fragment localization and found that it was not significantly affected by T3SS. Therefore, the T3SS defect phenotype of the transposon insertion mutant was likely caused by the polar effect or frameshift mutation induced by transposon (Dymov et al. 2004).

Since both the N-terminus deletion and C-terminus deletion of inV showed internalization and virulence defect, it is likely that LysM/\u03b2-barrel (N-terminus) and bacterial Ig-like domains (C-terminus) were essential for the function of InV.
