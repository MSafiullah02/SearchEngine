But for the vast majority of our patient encounters, this technology has proven to be an effective bridge. Indeed, it is likely that these visits will permanently replace in-person visits in some circumstances, particularly long-term follow-up appointments; However, we have not replaced the need for in-person visits for those patients who are on intravenous therapies. Somewhat unique to colorectal cancer, we prescribe home intravenous 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as a routine, but other agents such as oxaliplatin, irinotecan, bevacizumab, anti-EGFR agents and others, are still administered in an infusion unit by skilled nurses and supported by expert pharmacists.

Certainly, in the adjuvant setting for stage II and stage III patients, chemotherapy has a significant curative impact. We would suggest that curative therapies can still be modified without compromising long-term survival. In the metastatic setting, our treatment is primarily palliative and while we cannot simply put this treatment on hold for the next few months, we can make significant modifications that are unlikely to have a major negative impact on patient outcomes; \u2022 Reduce myelosuppression.",

Unlike influenza, secondary bacterial pneumonias do not appear to be as commonly associated with COVID-19 but are still seen in a minority of patients [11] . Lymphopenia is frequently seen in COVID-19, but this likely reflects active viral infection, more than vulnerability to becoming infected. Nevertheless, we recommend modifying regimens to reduce myelosuppression where possible, particularly in the palliative setting; \u2022 Avoid grade 3-4 toxicity that would require emergency room (ER) visits or hospitalizations Many of our treatments induce nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis and febrile neutropenia, among others, which result in emergency room evaluations and often admissions. While many of these toxicities can be predicted, most are not. Careful monitoring of kidney and liver function can help predict risk. In addition, pharmacogenetic tests of germline mutations in DPYD, UGT1A1 and others, can identify rare patients at risk for significant toxicities, but these are unlikely to significantly reduce unexpected adverse events and are not recommended in standard guidelines [12] ; We do know that by lowering doses we can reduce the frequency of grade 3-4 toxicities and, fortunately in colorectal cancer, there is little evidence that dose intensity carries a survival advantage. Therefore, it would be our recommendation for those patients that are being continued on more intensive regimens that dose modifications by as much as 25% be made proactively, particularly in the first few cycles, to ensure that grade 3/4 toxicities do not emerge. Moreover, we would favor adding prophylactic growth factor support in patients with borderline neutrophil counts at baseline. We would caution using growth factor in patients with confirmed COVID-19 given the risk of capillary leak syndrome; \u2022 Planning for 2-3 months, not a few weeks.",

Primary surgery for colorectal cancer will continue over the course of the next few months and patients will be looking to us for adjuvant therapy decisions.

Some companies providing this technology are offering in-home sample collection in support of this process. While not definitive or established, a positive tumor DNA test would compel us to initiate chemotherapy even during the pandemic. A negative test will be more difficult to apply but could justify delaying treatment or being less aggressive. Similarly, Immunoscore R quantifies immune cell infiltration in resected colorectal cancer and if a patient had a high-risk stage II colorectal cancer but with high Immunoscore, adjuvant chemotherapy has a lower likelihood of benefit and should be avoided [21] ; \u2022 Delay surgeries when appropriate (may be upwards of 2-3 months).",

This could be surgery to remove their primary tumor, a metastasectomy or the long awaited re-anastomosis. Decisions to delay surgery must be based on a multidisciplinary discussion, but could be justified based on hospital and ICU resources and patient risk. Some rectal cancer studies indicate that a watch-and-wait approach for patients with a clinical complete response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation is safe and leads to similar outcomes compared with patients who undergo surgery; however, other studies highlight an increased rate of distant metastases in those forgoing surgery [22, 23] . Regardless, a watch-and-wait approach may be appropriate in order to avoid surgery and its resulting hospitalization during the pandemic. Likewise, patients scheduled for resection of metastases could be maintained on oral chemotherapy or even treatment holiday until such time that it is safe to have surgery. These delays in surgery are unlikely to have a major negative impact on a given patient apart from the anxiety of waiting, which should not be minimized. In fact, any change in therapy which is recommended solely due to COVID-19 will cause some level of anxiety among our patients. Extra time will be required to explain the rationale for the recommendation and the establishment of a revised plan that is mutually agreed upon. During this period, more will be expected of our patients and patient selection, patient resources and caregiver support are critical to optimized outcomes. The following table was developed not as absolute guidelines but more as a framework for thinking through an individual patient's treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Emphasis should continue to be placed on multidisciplinary discussions balancing the patient's individual benefit from a given therapy against potential exposures within the hospital setting and limited resources within many hospitals dealing with a surge in COVID-19 patients.",
