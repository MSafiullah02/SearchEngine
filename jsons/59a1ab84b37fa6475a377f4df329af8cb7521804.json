Here we present a rapid and high-throughput screening method to study the substrate specificity of SARS-CoV 3CL pro . Six target amino acid positions flanking the SARS-CoV 3CL pro cleavage site were investigated. Each batch of mixed peptide substrates with defined amino acid substitutions at the target amino acid position was synthesized via the \"cartridge replacement\" approach and was subjected to enzymatic cleavage by recombinant SARS-CoV 3CL pro . Susceptibility of each peptide substrate to SARS-CoV 3CL pro cleavage was monitored simultaneously by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The hydrophobic pocket in the P2 position at the protease cleavage site is crucial to SARS-CoV 3CL pro -specific binding, which is limited to substitution by hydrophobic residue. The binding interface of SARS-CoV 3CL pro that is facing the P1\u00a2 position is suggested to be occupied by acidic amino acids, thus the P1\u00a2 position is intolerant to acidic residue substitution, owing to electrostatic repulsion. Steric hindrance caused by some bulky or bbranching amino acids in P3 and P2\u00a2 positions may also hinder the binding of SARS-CoV 3CL pro . This study generates a comprehensive overview of SARS-CoV 3CL pro substrate specificity, which serves as the design basis of synthetic peptide-based SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors. Our experimental approach is believed to be widely applicable for investigating the substrate specificity of other proteases in a rapid and high-throughput manner that is compatible for future automated analysis.",

To screen the substrate specificity of SARS-CoV 3CL pro in a rapid and highthroughput manner in contrast to the traditional tedious procedures, we applied the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometric (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis in combination with the novel \"cartridge replacement\" solid-phase peptide synthesis approach to investigate the biological significance of amino acid residues in the P2, P3, P4, P1\u00a2, P2\u00a2, and P3\u00a2 positions that are flanking the conserved Gln residue in the P1 position at the SARS-CoV 3CL pro cleavage site (Schechter and Berger 1967; Fan et al. 2004 Fan et al. , 2005 . Owing to the sensitivity of MALDI-TOF MS, the protease cleavage progress of a mixture of different peptide substrates can be monitored simultaneously to generate comprehensive data on the substrate specificity of SARS-CoV 3CL pro . Therefore, all of the 20 possibilities of amino acid substitutions in a particular position of the peptide substrate can be easily investigated in the same reaction. Our study can provide insights into the molecular mechanism of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro cleavage process and reveal the feasibility of developing synthetic peptide-based protease inhibitors as potential drugs against SARS-CoV and other coronavirus infections. Furthermore, the rapid approach we described in this study could be widely applicable for monitoring the cleavage activities of other proteases, such as allowing the rapid screening of potential protease inhibitors of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as the basis of drug development. In addition, automations are highly compatible and feasible with our experimental procedures to cope with the increasing demand of high-throughput analysis in proteomic research.",

Our results demonstrated consistency with other findings (Fan et al. 2004 (Fan et al. , 2005 , suggesting that the P2 position serves as an important hydrophobic pocket for SARS-CoV 3CL pro -specific binding; thus, the peptide substrate with replacement of the original Leu with the hydrophobic Phe in the P2 position was still susceptible to SARS-CoV 3CL pro cleavage (Fig.  4) . From the results of a previous time course cleavage experiment (data not shown), we observed that the Figure 3 .

Our peptide cleavage results revealed that the P1\u00a2 position is highly unfavorable to the substitution by Pro, Asp, and Glu residues ( Fig. 1; Table 2 ), which is consistent with molecular docking results showing their total energy levels being higher than that of the positive control peptide by more than fivefold. Our findings on the intolerance of Asp or Glu substitutions in the P1\u00a2 position suggest that the acidic residues at the binding interface of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro active site are probably in close proximity and sterically complementary to the P1\u00a2 position of the substrate, leading to electrostatic repulsions between the negatively charged acidic residues that hinder the substrate binding to SARS-CoV 3CL pro . Our molecular docking results also demonstrated that the P1\u00a2 position is proximal to the Glu47 and Asp48 residues at the SARS-CoV 3CL pro active site (Fig. 4) , which further confirmed our interpretations. Also, the unfavorable substitution by Pro in the P1\u00a2 position could be accounted for by the steric hindrance arising from its cyclic side chain (Fig. 4) , which obstructs the substrate binding to SARS-CoV 3CL pro . Previous studies also demonstrated that small aliphatic residues such as Ser, Ala, and Gly are favored in the P1\u00a2 position (Fan et al. 2005) .",

By combining the MALDI-TOF MS and synthetic peptide-based approaches, peptide-cleavage studies on the defined equal molar mixture of a batch of 20 peptide substrates before and after the protease cleavage reaction could be performed simultaneously on a single MALDI-TOF MS analysis. The MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer is Figure 4 . Comparison between the molecular models of different selected peptide substrates docked to the active site of SARS-CoV 3CL pro . The Cys145 (orange) and His41 (yellow) residues in the catalytic dyad of SARS-CoV 3CL pro (purple) and the conserved Gln residue (gray) in the P1 position at the cleavage site of the peptide substrate (red) were shown. (A) PS02 peptide with Phe (green) in the P2 position was in close proximity to the active site of SARS-CoV 3CL pro . Peptide substrates that were unfavorable for SARS-CoV 3CL pro cleavage were deviated away from the active site of SARS-CoV 3CL pro , which include PS03 peptide with Pro (blue) in the P3 position (B); PS05 peptide with Pro (blue) in the P1\u00a2 position (C); PS05 peptide with Asp (blue) in the P1\u00a2 position that was in close proximity to the acidic residues (brown) at the active site (D); PS05 peptide with Glu (blue) in the P1\u00a2 position that was in close proximity to the acidic residues (brown) at the active site (E); PS06 peptide with Pro (blue) in the P2\u00a2 position (F); PS06 peptide with Ile (blue) in the P2\u00a2 position (G); PS06 peptide with Leu (blue) in the P2\u00a2 position (H). a delicate and sensitive instrument that enables clear and precise discrimination of different peptides, even with single amino acid difference. Therefore, each of the 20 peptide substrates with equal molar ratios in the same mixture can be monitored simultaneously on a single MALDI-TOF MS analysis before and after the protease cleavage reaction. Our approach is advantageous over the traditional methods that are restricted to testing single peptides with defined condition one at a time and the setup of a total of 20 identical experimental conditions for every analysis. After generating the comprehensive cleavage profile on the 20 peptides simultaneously based on the primary screening procedure of the \"cartridge replacement\" strategy, we can easily identify some of the biologically important residues taking part in the recognition process. Nevertheless, we employed the secondary screening procedure using the defined batch-synthesis approach to synthesize target peptides in different batches for exact identification purpose (ambiguous residues like Ile/Leu and Gln/Lys that carry identical or close masses). Our approach provides an option in which the resolution of the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer instrument is not sensitive enough to distinguish between species with 1-Da mass difference. Also, MALDI-TOF MS analysis is tolerant to impurities; therefore, the reaction mixture can be analyzed directly after a simple desalting procedure, which reduces the workload of subsequent downstream purifications of cleavage products prior to analysis.",

Cleavage products were desalted by ZipTip U-C18 (Millipore), and the corresponding peptide peaks before and after the cleavage reactions were resolved by mass spectrometry on an Ettan MALDI-TOF Pro Mass Spectrometer (Amersham Biosciences) or an ABI 4700 MALDI TOF/TOF Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). For acquisition of mass spectra, 0.5-mL aliquots of samples were dispensed onto the MALDIplate, followed by a 0.5-mL matrix solution (5 g/L a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). All spectra were acquired in a reflectron-positive ion mode and accumulated from 1000 laser shots with acceleration of 20 kV and pulsed extraction. Angiotensin III (m/z value of 897.523) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (m/z value of 2465.199) were used as standards for internal calibration of MALDI-TOF MS spectra.",

            "text": "All three-dimensional molecular modeling studies were performed on an Insight II molecular modeling platform (Accelrys Software Inc.) run on Silicon Graphics Octane2 workstations (Silicon Graphics Inc.). The consistent valence force field (CVFF) was selected in all simulations. The X-ray crystal structure of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro (1UK4) was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (PDB; http://www.rcsb.org/pdb) and used as a starting model. The catalytic active site of chain A in the SARS-CoV 3CL pro structure without the bound CMK peptide was used in the study. Hydrogen atoms were added for the structure of SARS-CoV 3CL pro chain A using the BUILDER module. Then, the force field potentials and partial charges were assigned. The resulting structure was subsequently subjected to energy minimization using the DIS-COVER module and was used as the initial structures for molecular docking. Since the proteolytic activity SARS-CoV 3CL pro mainly relies on the active nucleophile Cys145 and the acid-base catalyst His41, the region containing all residues (10.0 \u00c5 radius) around this Cys-His dyad was selected as the target site and was used to set up as a grid with the DOCKING module. The nonbond energies of this region were precalculated on the grid. Different peptide substrates were then docked into the target site by manual docking using the DOCKING module. The best docking position was based on the docking energy of the peptide/SARS-CoV 3CL pro complex. Thousands of orientations of peptides were searched by maneuvering in the Cys-His dyad region of SARS-CoV 3CL pro manually until reaching the energy minimum. The resultant complex was subjected to energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulation using the DISCOVER module. A dielectric constant of 1.0 was used throughout the energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulation. The system was equilibrated at 300 K for 100 psec, during which time the potential energy of the system reached a stable value. A time step of 1 fsec was used to integrate the equation of motion. The final conformation of the structure was obtained through 5000 iterations of steepest descent energy minimization. Ultimately, the total docking energy between the peptide substrate and SARS-CoV 3CL pro in the energy-minimized complex was calculated using the DOCKING module. The docking energy included the van der Waals and electrostatic energies, which were the components of the intermolecular energy.",
