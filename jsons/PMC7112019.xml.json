            "text": "Swine enteric alphacoronavirus (SeACoV), also known as swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), is a novel porcine enteric coronavirus that causes acute vomiting and watery diarrhea in piglets (Gong et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018). This emerging virus was first isolated from clinically sick animals in commercial swine herds at Guangdong province, China during February\u2013May 2017. The mortality rate in less than 5 days old piglets was over 90%, whereas it dropped to 5% in piglets older than 8 days (Zhou et al., 2018). The clinical samples examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) during laboratory investigation were negative for the other swine coronaviruses such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), as well as the other known viral pathogens (Pan et al., 2017). Isolation of the pathogen in African green monkey Vero cells resulted in the discovery of SeACoV (Pan et al., 2017), which belongs to the species Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2 identified in the same region a decade earlier (Lau et al., 2007). A retrospective study indicated that the virus had emerged in Guangdong since August 2016 (Zhou et al., 2019). The isolated virus was infectious to pigs and cause mild or severe diarrhea symptom when inoculated orally into conventional newborn piglets (Pan et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2018). Nevertheless, as SeACoV fulfilled the premises of Koch's Postulates, this was regarded to be the etiologic agent of the epidemic.",

            "text": "The CoV genome harbors a few genus-specific accessory genes within the 3\u2019-part genomic region encoding the four structural proteins (S-E-M-N). It is found that SeACoV contains a putative open reading frame (ORF), NS7a, and a downstream NS7b ORF (overlapped with NS7a) after the N gene at the 3\u2019-end genome (Lau et al., 2007; Pan et al., 2017). The NS7a is shared by the HKU2 and SeACoV strains, whereas NS7b is only present in the SeACoV genome (Zhou et al., 2018). Many of CoV accessory proteins play some important roles in immune modulation and viral pathogenesis (Liu et al., 2014). For examples, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) ORF-3a was found to induce necrotic cell death, lysosomal damage and caspase-1 activation, which largely contribute to the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV infection (Yue et al., 2018). In addition, SARS-CoV ORF6 and ORF7b may also be also associated with the virulence. In another newly emerged swine CoV, PDCoV, its accessory NS6 protein has been reported to counteract host innate antiviral immune response by inhibiting IFN-\u03b2 production that interacts with RIG-I/MDA5 (Fang et al., 2018). Whether the predicted NS7a and NS7b of SeACoV encode functional accessory proteins remain to be confirmed experimentally.",

Perinuclear and cytoplasmic foci were detected by anti-N staining at 4 and 8 hpi, and were distributed throughout the cytoplasm at 12 and 24 hpi, probably reflecting that N protein is associated with sites of viral RNA replication in early infection phase (Verheije et al., 2010) and assembled into virions subsequently (Fig. 1B). Anti-Ac (Nsp3) staining also resulted in detection of perinuclear foci at four time points, indicating localization to the viral replication-transcription complexes (Fig. 1C), which was similar to the pattern of Nsp3 antibody observed in SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells (Prentice et al., 2004). Confocal microscopy detected discrete cytoplasmic fluorescence signal throughout the cytoplasm with anti-M (Fig. 1D) and anti-S1 (Fig. 1E) as early as 4 hpi. Diffuse and more intense fluorescence was observed over time, demonstrating the process of virus assembly by incorporation of M and S proteins into virus particles.",

Thus far, the RNA polymerases II-based DNA-launched reverse genetics system using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) as the backbone vector has been applied to rescue of multiple CoVs (Almazan et al., 2014). Basically, homogenous RNA transcripts are generated from transfected full-length cDNA clone in permissive cells to launch virus life cycle. Recently, our lab has just developed a novel and efficient method to assemble a full-length cDNA clone of measles virus (~16 kb) by using the GeneArt\u2122 High-Order Genetic Assembly System, without the need for restriction endonucleases, which was used to rescue recombinant measles virus and the derived vaccine candidates (Wang et al., 2018). We employed this strategy successfully to assemble the 27.2-kb SeACoV genomic cDNA from the passage-10 virus (\u201cSeACoV-p10\u201d) by a single step ligation of 15 overlapping fragments into a BAC expression vector, resulting in a full-length cDNA clone of SeACoV named pSEA (Fig. 2\nA). The SeACoV genomic cDNA cassette on pSEA was engineered with a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (HDVRz) followed by a bovine growth hormone polyadenylation and termination sequences (BGH) at both termini, respectively. In addition, two silent mutations (A24222T and G24223C) in ORF3 were introduced in pSEA as a genetic marker to distinguish the parental virus SeACoV-p10 (Fig. 2A).",

The virus particles measured 100\u2013120 nm in diameter with surface projections (Fig. 2D), consistent with our previous report of SeACoV isolation in Vero cells (Pan et al., 2017). The comparative growth kinetics of rSeACoV and the parental SeACoV-p10 were analyzed by infection of Vero cells with the respective virus at the same multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. The infectious virus titers were determined at different time points post-infection (2, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 hpi). The result showed that rSeACoV had the growth kinetics similar to the parental SeACoV-p10 (Fig. 2E). Of note, the maximal rates of SeACoV-p10 or rSeACoV production were from 6 to 12 hpi, suggesting that the exponential release of virus occurred before 6 hpi, which was consistent with detection of N, M, S and Ac expression as early as 4 hpi (Fig. 1B\u2013E). The single-cycle growth of SeACoV in Vero cells is hence similar to those of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), SARS-CoV and PDCoV, taking approximately 4\u20136 h (Prentice et al., 2004; Qin et al., 2019). These data collectively demonstrated that rSeACoV and its parental virus share the same virological features. To our knowledge, this is the first study describing a SeACoV/SADS-CoV infectious clone. Previous studies on CoV reverse genetics have shown that CoV accessory genes such as ORF3 [in TGEV (Sola et al., 2003), SARS-CoV (Yount et al., 2005), PEDV (Ji et al., 2018) or human CoV NL63 (Donaldson et al., 2008)] and the gene 7 [in TGEV (Ortego et al., 2003)] are dispensable for propagation in vitro. The corresponding genes, ORF3 and NS7a, are also present in the SeACoV genome; therefore, we will aim to generate reporter virus expressing luciferase or green fluorescent protein by replacement of ORF3 or NS7a with the reporter gene in future studies.",

Since amplification with the reverse primer NS7a-R could not cover the entire NS7b, we next determined whether a potential NS7b sgRNA is present using the leader primer LF and a new reverse primer NS7-R corresponding to the 3\u2019-end of ORF7b by RT-PCR. A single band of approximately 400-bp was amplified by optimizing the PCR condition and detected by agarose gel electrophoresis analysis; the other smaller bands were not found (Fig. 3E). Sequence analysis revealed that the TRS for this bicistronic sgRNA NS7 was exactly AACUAAA and one nt upstream of the AUG start codon of NS7a, which is consistent with the prediction (Fig. 3E). We further expressed and purified the complete NS7a or NS7b gene in the bacteria. Both products were found in the inclusion bodies. However, the resulting anti-NS7a or anti-NS7b pAb did not react with any antigens in SeACoV-infected cells by IFA and western blot analysis (data not shown) in contrast to the four working SeACoV pAbs. This suggests that NS7a and NS7b are either, not highly antigenic or the denatured antigens used to generate pAbs destroy the native protein structure. Development of monoclonal antibodies against NS7a and NS7b used for experimental validation of the existence of two expression products at the protein level is underway.",

DMVs are membrane structures where viral genomic RNA is recognized by the host cell machinery and translated into non-structural proteins (ORF1ab), assembling into viral replication\u2013transcription complexes (Gosert et al., 2002), whereas LVCVs are large circular organelles that are thought to originate from Golgi compartments expanding to accommodate numerous precursor virions (Ulasli et al., 2010). The other type of membrane structure usually seen is phagosome-like vacuoles or lysosomes containing endoplasmic reticulum (ER), small vesicles, damaged mitochondrion and other vesicles. These conserved structures were also observed directly under an electron microscope (EM) in SeACoV-infected Vero cells (Fig. 4\nA; 24 hpi) but not in uninfected cells (Fig. 4C). Of note, time course analysis of Nsp3 detection in Fig. 1C likely indicated corresponding locations of the DMVs.",

Interestingly, PEDV appeared to induce a higher number of DMVs and LVCVs in large clusters surrounding the nucleus at 24 hpi and thereafter (Fig. 4B). A previous study on qualitative and quantitative ultrastructural analysis of membrane rearrangements induced by MHV proposed that CoV RNA synthesis is dictated by the number of DMVs, whereas an increasing production of viral particles is accommodated by LVCVs from expanding of ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC)/Golgi compartments (Ulasli et al., 2010).

Recombinant SeACoV had similar growth kinetics to the parental virus. The single-cycle growth of SeACoV in Vero cells was determined to take approximately 4\u20136 h. By RT-PCR analysis, we experimentally identified all proposed SeACoV sgRNAs containing the leader-body junction sites. Among six sgRNAs, a bicistronic mRNA 7 was utilized by the accessory NS7a and NS7b genes. Finally, we characterized the cellular ultrastructural changes induced by SeACoV infection in vitro.
