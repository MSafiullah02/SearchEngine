The killing was attributed to Mossad 1 The European Union, which considers Hamas a terrorist organization, nonetheless condemned the assassination of the Hamas leader and showed particular concern over the fact that the killers had used passports from Ireland, France, Germany and the UK-to coordinate their travel into Dubai from various parts of the world, synchronizing their arrival time from various flights into Dubai International Airport and checking into the hotel of the victim contemporaneously. The EU strongly condemned the fact that those involved in this action used fraudulent EU member states' passports and credit cards acquired through the theft of EU citizens' identities. 2 Australia was another complainant who warned Israel that its friendly relations with Israel would be jeopardised if it were found to have condoned the suspected 1 Mossad is responsible for the collection of intelligence and other covert activities including military operations.

The diplomatic impasse occurred when three Australians from Victoria living in Israel at the time were confirmed among 26 people from four nations whose tampered passports were allegedly used by a team of suspected Israeli Mossad agents who assassinated al-Mabhouh. Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd is reported to have stated that Australia would be vocal in its contempt of any State if it were found that it \". . . has been complicit in the use or abuse of the Australian passport system, let alone for the conduct of an assassination, and has treated Australia with contempt and there will therefore be action by the Australian government in response\". 3 Dubai authorities are reported to have said that they were virtually certain Israeli agents carried out the killing and had released the identities of 11 people who travelled on forged British, Irish, French and German passports to kill al-Mabhouh in a hotel. 4 There is seemingly a history behind alleged Mossad involvement in the use of fake foreign passports in its activities. Reportedly, in 2004 New Zealand's prime minister imposed diplomatic sanctions-restricting visas and cancelling high level visits-after two Mossad agents were caught trying to acquire passports fraudulently-one in the name of a tetraplegic man. Seven years earlier, Mossad assassins carrying Canadian passports with assumed names attempted to murder the Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal by spraying nerve agent into his ear as he entered his office in Amman. 5 The fundamental issue that emerges is one that is critical to air law in the context of the integrity and ownership of the passport and its abuse in criminal activity. There is also the issue, from a legal and diplomatic perspective is whether a State or instrumentality of State such as Mossad, can, with impunity, use forged passports for travel of its staff on missions of espionage or assassination. A fortiori, an additional issue is whether a State could be complicit or condone or be seen to 3 http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/australians-caught-in-hit-on-hamas/story-e6frg6so-1225834538825. It is reported that in 1997, Mossad bungled the assassination of top Hamas leader Khalid Mishal, who was injected while in Jordan with a poison by Israeli agents travelling on Canadian documents. He survived after his assailants were captured by his bodyguards and Israel provided the antidote. In 2004, two Mossad agents were jailed in New Zealand after trying to obtain fake passports, one in the name of a cerebral palsy sufferer.

Hamas, which won 2006 legislative elections in the Palestinian territories, is shunned by the West for rejecting its calls to recognise Israel and renounce violence. Hit squads dispatched by Mossad have used foreign passports in the past, notably in 1997 when agents entered Jordan on Canadian passports and bungled an attempt to kill Meshaal with poison. In 1987, Britain protested to Israel about what London called the misuse by Israeli authorities of forged British passports and said it received assurances steps had been taken to prevent future occurrences. In 2003, the offices of several EU member countries in the Council's Justus Lipsius building, including France, Germany and the UK, were found to be bugged.

            "text": "Starting from the premise that the passport is primarily a document which establishes the identity of the holder, 6 the various approaches 7 taken by ICAO in advancing technologies that facilitate this task at borders have evolved into the use of biometric identification of the passport holder as the ultimate frontier in the identification process. The techniques of biometrics employed in a machine readable travel document (MRTD), be it a visa or passport, 8 enable the user to uniquely encode a particular physical characteristic of a person into a biometric identifier or biometric template which can be verified by machine to confirm or deny a claim regarding a person's identity. Accordingly, biometric identification of a person either correctly establishes his identity as being consistent with what is claimed in the passport he is holding or brings to bear the possibility that the person carrying a particular passport is an imposter. A biometric is a measurable, physical 6 See Naziranbai v. the State, 1957 Madhya Bharat Law Reporter, at 1, where the court recognized the passport as essentially being a document of identity and nationality issued to citizens or subjects of a state who intend to travel overseas. See also, Turack (1972) at 20-21. Also, Abeyratne (1992) at 10. 7 ICAO has been working on the development of passports since 1968. The Seventh Session of the ICAO Facilitation Division in 1968 recommended that a small panel of qualified experts including representatives of the passports and/or other border control authorities, be established: to determine the establishment of an appropriate document such as a passport card, a normal passport or an identity document with electronically or mechanically readable inscriptions that meet the requirements of document control; the best type of procedures, systems (electronic or mechanical) and equipment for use with the above documents that are within the resources and ability of Member States; the feasibility of standardizing the requisite control information and methods of providing this information through automated processes, provided that these processes would meet the requirements of security, speed of handling and economy of operation. See Facilitation Division, Report of the Seventh Session, 14-30 May 1968, ICAO Doc 8750-FAL/564, Agenda Item 2.3, at 2.3-4. See also AT-WP/1079, 1/12/70, Attachment A, which sets out the Terms of Reference of the Panel. 8 A passport asserts that the person holding the passport is a citizen of the issuing State while a visa confirms that the State issuing the visa has granted the visa holder the non-citizen privilege of entering and remaining in the territory of the issuing State for a specified time and purpose. The machine readable passport (MRP) is a passport that has both a machine readable zone and a visual zone in the page that has descriptive details of the owner. The machine readable zone enables rapid machine clearance, quick verification and instantaneous recording of personal data. Besides these advantages, the MRP also has decided security benefits, such as the possibility of matching very quickly the identity of the MRP owner against the identities of undesirable persons, whilst at the same time offering strong safeguards against alteration, counterfeit or forgery. Abeyratne (1992) , pp. 1-31. characteristic or personal behavioral trait used to recognize the identity, or verify 9 the claimed identity of a person. In the modern context, biometrics are usually incorporated in an MRTD with a view to achieving five goals, the first of which is global interoperability 10 enabling the specifications of biometrics deployed in travel documents across the world to be applied and used in a universally operable manner. This is a critical need if the smooth application of biometric technology were to be ensured across borders. The second goal is to ensure uniformity within States in specific standard setting by States authorities who deploy biometrics in travel documents issued by them. The third is technical reliability, where States are required to ensure that technologies used in deploying biometrics are largely failure-proof and of sufficient quality and standard to ensure a State immigration authority reading documents issued by other States them that the details in the document do provide accurate verification of facts. Fourthly, the technology used has to be practical and not give rise to the need for applying disparate types of support technology at unnecessary cost and inconvenience to the user. The final goal is to ensure that the technology used will be sufficiently up to date for at least 10 years and also be backwardly compatible with new techniques to be introduced in the future.",

Global interoperability is a major objective of the standardized specifications for placement of both eye-readable and machine-readable data in all MRTDs. 11 The Chicago Convention, supra, defines, in Article 2, \"territory of a State\" as the land areas and territorial waters adjacent to the State under the sovereignty, suzerainty, protection and mandate of such State. This measure not only ensures that the holder of the document is the legitimate claimant to that document and to whom it was issued, but also enhances the efficacy of any advance passenger information (API) 12 system used by the State to pre-determine the arrivals to its territory. Furthermore, matching biometric data presented in the form of the traveler with the data contained in the template accurately ascertains as to whether the travel document has been tampered with or not. A three way check, which matches the traveler's biometrics with those stored in the template carried in the document and a central database, is an even more efficacious way of determining the genuineness of a travel document. The final and most efficient biometric check is when a four way determine is effected, were the digitized photograph is visually matched (non electronically) with the three way check described above. 13 In this context, it is always recommended that the traveler's facial image (conventional photograph) should be incorporated in the travel document along with the biometric templates in order to ensure that his identity could be verified at locations where there is no direct access to a central database or where the biometric identification process has not entered into the legal process of that location.",

Biometric identification gets into gear each time an MRTD holder (traveler) enters or exists the territory of a State and when the State verifies his identity against the images or templates created at the time his travel document was issued. This measure not only ensures that the holder of the document is the legitimate claimant to that document and to whom it was issued, but also enhances the efficacy of any advance passenger information (API) system used by the State to pre-determine the arrivals to its territory.",

The action was grounded on the basis that two of the passengers in the passenger list earlier provided to the US authorities were on a \"no fly\" list. The importance of this drama to modern day aviation is that the aircraft was merely over-flying the territory of a State. Even more important is the fact that at the time of the incident, there was no US legislation covering the act of refusal to grant over-flying permission to an aircraft in that situation. 15 However, within days, The US Transportation Security Administration (TSA) announced that rules will be adopted to require that 15 passengers on all flights landing in and overflying US territory will be screened against a \"no fly\" list. 16 The Passenger Name Record (PNR) is a subject that has been under intense scrutiny by the Council of ICAO which has developed PNR Data Guidelines that have been transmitted to Contracting States for their comments 17 This exercise was carried out on the understanding that, in the present context of the compelling need for the enhancement of aviation security, the global aviation community has shown an increased interest 18 in adding the PNR data as a security measure in addition to the already existing Advanced Passenger Information (API) 19 and the Machine Readable Travel Document (MRTD), which, although primarily are facilitation tools, greatly assist States authorities in ensuring border security.",

For example, information captured through reservations created by international sales organizations (global distribution systems \"GDS\" or computer reservation systems \"CRS\") with pertinent details of the PNR could be transmitted to the operating carrier(s). When reservations are made directly by the aircraft operator and the complete PNR is stored within the operator's automated reservations systems, the information therein could be a useful repository of PNR data. Information contained in records of some operators who may hold sub-sets of the PNR data within their own automated departure control systems (DCS), for their information or for onward transmittal to contracted ground handling service providers, calculated to support airport check-in functions would be another way in which PNR data could be provided. However, it must be noted that in each case, operators (or their authorized agents) will have access to, and be able to amend only that data that has been provided to their system(s). An important consideration in this regard is that some DCS systems are programmed such that details emerging from checkin (i.e. seat and/or baggage information) can be overlaid into the existing PNR for each passenger.

Therefore, where there could be an inconsistency between two legal regimes of the departure State and the destination State, or where a conflict arises between any two States, or where an operator advises of a conflict, The ICAO guidelines suggest that the States involved should consult each other to determine what might be done to enable affected operators to continue to operate within the bounds of the laws in both States.",

            "text": "The above principle of extra-territoriality might not sit comfortably in the instance of a State requiring PNR data from a flight over-flying its territory as there is no stricto sensu application of a requirement in a foreign territory. The most fundamental principle of public international law, that of State sovereignty, is embodied in Article 1 of the Chicago, thus importing the principle into the tenets of air law. This Article provides that Contracting States recognize that every State has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the air space above its territory. The territory of a State, for the purposes of the Convention, cover the land areas and territorial waters adjacent to and under the sovereign, suzerainty, protection and mandate of the State concerned. 29 Arguably, these provisions would give the United States the right in limine to prescribe requirements on aircraft flying over its territory. Article 12 of the Chicago Convention provides, inter alia, that each contracting State undertakes to adopt measures to insure that every aircraft flying over or manoeuvring within its territory and that every aircraft carrying its nationality mark, wherever that aircraft may be, shall comply with the rules and regulations relating to the flight and manoeuvre of aircraft there in force. This rule can apply to a foreign carrier who is over-flying the territory of any State having a regulation that certain data pertaining to a flight that over-flies its territory has to be submitted to that State. Also important is Article 9 of the Convention, which allows a Contracting State to restrict or prohibit an aircraft from flying over its territory for reasons of military necessity or public safety. The provision goes on to say that each contracting State could also reserve the right, in exceptional circumstances or during a period of emergency, or in the interest of public safety and with immediate effect, temporarily to restrict or prohibit flying over the whole or part of its territory, provided such action would apply without distinction of nationality to aircraft of all States. 30 At the 28th Session of the International Law Association held in Madrid in 1913, the meeting drew up text which stated that it was the right of every State to enact prohibitions, restrictions and regulations as it may think proper in regard to passage of aircraft through the airspace above its territory and territorial waters. 31 the text contained a caveat that such restrictions should be subject to the rights of subjacent States and the liberty of passage of aircraft of every nation. 32 The balance advocated at the Madrid meeting of the ILA goes to show that even as early as the beginning of the last century, the thinking was that a State ought to allow other States free passage for their aircraft through the airspace above its territory. There is no doubt that the same position prevails even now, particularly through the currently applicable International Air Services Transit Agreement (IASTA) which was concluded at the same time as the Chicago Convention in December 1944 and has been ratified by many ICAO Contracting States. IASTA allows aircraft of foreign States freedom of peaceful transit (over the airspace of a State) and freedom of making non-traffic (non-revenue) stops for such purposes as refuelling and repair. It has been acknowledged that without these two freedoms, the air transport industry could not survive 33 The above discussion brings one to the inexorable conclusion that there are two major issues at stake. The first is whether the OPNR is an acceptable tool which helps in enhancing facilitation and security measures in air transport. The answer to this question, as provided by the 12th ICAO Facilitation Division in March/April 2004 and subsequently by the ICAO Council 34 is a resounding \"yes\". This affirmation brings to bear the need to consider whether the PNR should be used strictly as intended, firstly to facilitate customs and immigration procedures regarding persons and secondly to advise States in advance of persons on board an aircraft approaching their territory for purposes of landing there, enabling States to determine appropriate security clearance measures. The security angle of the PNR brings one to the second issue, as to whether a State can use information contained in the PNR to disallow the right of passage to an aircraft flying over its territory, thereby denying that aircraft a fundamental right acknowledged by States through IASTA.",

Nation States are becoming more interdependent, making decisions made by a particular State in its own interest have a significant negative impact on the interests of other States. Therefore ethics in foreign policy has largely become a construct which combines cultural, psychological and ideological value structures. Within this somewhat complex web of interests, decisions have to be made, which, as recent events in history have shown, require a certain spontaneity from the international community. For example, when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, the members of the United Nations chose economic sanctions against Iraq, claiming that war was the last resort to be embarked upon against Iraq if economic sanctions did not prove to have any effect. In hindsight, one could argue one way or another, firstly, as did the United States, that the use of force bore quick results and, on the hand, as did many officials in Paris, Moscow, Ottawa and Washington, that the decision to wage war against Iraq was too precipitous as not enough time had been given to economic sanctions to compel Iraq to retreat from Kuwait. The precipitous but quick action taken in going to war with Iraq might be justified by some with the analogy of Britain appeasing Hitler in the 1930s without adopting a more aggressive and perhaps belligerent attitude toward German atrocities. This action, which was later labeled as folly by most political scientists, was applauded and endorsed at that time in the British Parliament. In the absence of extra territoriality the only balancing factor in favor of State which orders the diversion of an aircraft overflying its territory, on the basis that persons therein are unacceptable is to have sound justification for doing so in the interests of security and safety.",

The establishment of a public key directory, through means of public key cryptology and in a PKI environment, is consistent with ICAO's ultimate aim and vision for the application of biometric technology on the fundamental postulate that there must be a primary interoperable form of biometric technology for use at border control with facilities for verification, as well as by carriers and the issuers of documents.

The study itself had resulted in a four-part recommendation of the TAG/MRTD.

Although Article 37 (j) is directly in point, it is somewhat questionable as to whether Articles 13 and 33 bestow upon ICAO any special mandate to address the need to develop machine readable travel documents and technology related thereto. Article 13 merely states that the laws of States with regard to various aspects of entry and departure should be complied with. Article 23 provides that each Contracting State undertakes, inter alia, to establish customs and immigration procedures. uploading their public keys. As the supervisory authority, ICAO would act on behalf of e-passport issuing States; be responsible for establishment of the PKD system, appointment of the PKD operator; and providing oversight of the system operation, financial matters and policies as decided or approved by the Council. In this regard ICAO's functions would include: receipt of new key certificates from e-passport issuing States, verification of their authenticity, and formal acceptance and uploading to the PKD; liaison with all country contributors and users, and with contractor operational staff, in administrative and operational matters such as new country sign-up and collection of fees; calculation of proposed fee schedules; distribution of revenue to the PKD operator and relevant ICAO units, and development of the regulations and procedures manuals; and periodic reporting to the Council on all of the above matters.",

Firstly there would be the \"group\" of e-passport issuing States, comprising a group that would be constituted as a legal body with its own governance structure. This body would be the owner of the PKD and determine independently its mode of operations-including membership, and financial operations. Secondly, there would be ICAO, duly authorized by the Council to act as an agent of the Group, with defined responsibility for providing advice to the Group and executing the work of the group based on agreed terms and conditions. It is envisioned that such an arrangement would cover ICAO against any financial liability arising either from contracting with a third party or a shortfall in the finances of the group. The Group, as a whole, should underwrite the financing of the activities undertaken by ICAO. The last person in the triangle is the contractor, who is appointed either by the group or by ICAO on authority granted by the Group. ICAO's responsibility for the management of the contractor's activity would be defined by the Group. 6.1.9 Legal Liability of ICAO As stated above, ICAO's responsibility with regard to oversight of the PKD process would involve two areas, i.e. maintenance and administration. A host of functions are attached to these two supervisory functions, such as acting on behalf of e-passport issuing States, and being responsible for establishment of the PKD system, appointment of the PKD operator and providing oversight of the system operation, financial matters and policies as decided or approved by the Council. The first question that arises in regard to ICAO's legal status is whether the Organization has the legal capacity to perform the abovementioned functions and be responsible for them. In other words, if ICAO's legal liability were to be questioned in a court of law in any jurisdiction of an ICAO member State, would the courts recognize ICAO as having the legal capacity to assume these functions and be legally accountable for them?",

Then, 2 months after the attacks, in November 2001, Congress passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) with a view to improving security and closing the security loopholes which existed on that fateful day in September 2001. The legislation paved the way for a huge federal body called the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) which was established within the Department of Transportation.

It will be recalled that after the spate of hijackings in the late 1960s and 1970s, States rushed to install detectors with X-Ray capability at the entrance to the aircraft gate. Then, as the displacement theory 40 demonstrated, terrorists moved their attention towards attacking airports, which prompted States to install screening equipment at centralized points in the terminal itself. In similar vein, in the aftermath of the attempted bombing of an aircraft on 25 December 2009 by a person who is alleged to have carried explosives in his undergarments, some States began to look seriously into tightening airport security, particularly through a more stringent body scanning process. While the United States toughened screening measures on US bound flights, particularly with regard to passengers arriving from 14 targeted nations, 41 airports in the United Kingdom began the use of full body scanners at both Heathrow and Manchester airports. 42 In Canada, Rob Merrifield, Minister of State for Transport is reported to have stated that 44 scanners have been ordered to be used on passengers selected for secondary screening at Canadian airports. The machines, which can scan through clothing, will be installed in Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and Halifax. 43 This measure is partly due to the fact that the Christmas day incident was later classified as having occurred due to a serious lapse in security. 40 The Displacement Theory suggests that removing opportunity for crime or seeking to prevent a crime by changing the situation in which it occurs (see Situational Crime Prevention) does not actually prevent crime but merely moves it around. There are five main ways in which this theory suggests crime is moved around: crime can be moved from one location to another (geographical displacement); crime can be moved from one time to another (temporal displacement); crime can be directed away from one target to another (target displacement); one method of committing crime can be substituted for another (tactical displacement); and one kind of crime can be substituted for another (crime type displacement). 41 ",

However, it should be noted that this is just one more reactive step-to ensure that no person enters an aircraft with explosives hidden in his underwear-and the only known way to respond to this new threat is to use full body scanner.

This scheme of things may well give the outward perception of surveillance attributable to computer devices monitoring individuals' most intimate activities, preferences and physical attributes, leading to the formation of a genuine \"traceable society\". 60 The main feature of this complex web of technological activity is that an enormous amount of personal information handled by such varied players from the public and private sector, may bring about concerns of possible \"data leaks\" in the system, a risk that could have drastic legal consequences affecting an individual's rights to privacy.",

United Kingdom and Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v. United States of America regarding the PANAM 103 accident at Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, where the International Court of Justice requested air carriers to submit to the Court the defendants' flight information and reservation details. See International Court of Justice. News Release 99/36, \"Questions of Interpretation and Application of the 1971 Montreal Convention arising from the Aerial Incident at Lockerbie\" (1 July 1999), online: http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idocket/iluk/ iluk2frame.html (date accessed: 14 July 2000). In a similar vein, Arthur R. Miller describes the significance of airline computer reservation system records when dealing with federal, state, local, and other types of investigations where these dossiers could provide valuable information. See also Miller (1971) at 42. 60 See Scott (1995) at 307; Burnham (1983) at 20. A contrario to the argument supported in this thesis that the advancement of technology directly affects the intimacy of individuals. U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Posner favours the idea that other factors, such as urbanisation, income, and mobility development have particularly weakened the information control that, for instance, the government has over individuals: this denotes that individuals' privacy has increased. See Posner (1978) at 409. 61 The text reads: \"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks\". to establish a necessary legal framework to protect the individual and his rights inherent to the enjoyment of a private life.",

            "text": "The right of privacy, as enunciated by the United States Judge Thomas M. Cooley, was the right \"to be let alone\" as a part of a more general right to one's personality. This idea was given further impetus by two prominent young lawyers, Samuel D. Warren and Louis D. Brandeis, 66 in 1890. 67 Before this idea was introduced, the concept of privacy reflected primarily a somewhat physical property or life. The foundations of \"information privacy\", whereby the individuals would determine when, how, and to what extent information about themselves would be communicated to others, inextricably drawing the right of control of information about oneself, 68 is a cornerstone of privacy. With the development of computer capabilities to handle large amounts of data, privacy has been enlarged to include the collection, storage, use, and disclosure of personal information. 69 The notion of informational privacy protection, a typically American usage, has been particularly popular both in the United States and Europe, where the term \"data protection\" is used. 70 63 See Regan (1995) at 33; Freund (1971) at 182. 64 In this case, the US Supreme Court acknowledged the right of women to have abortions based on the grounds that the federal government could not interfere within her \"decisional privacy\" sphere. See Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) . See also Cate (1997) at 49. See also Zelermyer (1959) at 16. 65 In a remarkable case concerning the legality of a national census scheduled by the authorities, the German Constitutional court connected the individual's liberty and the personal data processing of the intended census, to rule that if the individuals do not know for what purposes and who is collecting the data, that situation will eventually create an abdication of the individual's rights to the processor's command, \"which cannot be tolerated in a democratic society\". See Simitis (1995) , pp. 447-448. See also Hoffer (2000) at 8.1.; Gavison (1980) , p. 421. 66 See Cooley (1888) , as cited in Warren and Brandeis (1980) at 195. 67 The definition of privacy as the \"Right to be Alone\" is often erroneously attributed to Warren and Brandeis. See Warren and Brandeis (1980) . See Cooley (1888) as cited in Warren and Brandeis (1980) at 195. Additionally the concept of privacy as \"the right to be let alone\", and \"the right most valued by civilized man\": was embraced by US courts in the landmark dissenting opinion of Justice Louis D. Reidenberg (1995) at 498. 70 The former Privacy Commissioner of British Columbia, Canada, has asserted that privacy was originally a \"non-legal concept\". See Flaherty (1991) at 833-834. The term \"data protection\" has been translated from the German word Datenschutz, referring to a set of policies seeking to regulate the collection, storage, use, and transfer of personal information. See Bennet (1992) at 13. Self-determination in the right to protect one's privacy was first judicially embraced by the German Bundesverfassungsgericht in 1983. The US Supreme court followed this trend by adopting the principle of privacy self-determination in DOJ v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press. 71 It must be borne in mind that privacy is not an absolute, unlimited right that operates and applies in isolation. 72 It is not an absolute right, applied unreservedly, to the exclusion of other rights. Hence there is frequently the necessity to balance privacy rights with other conflictive rights, such as the freedom of speech and the right to access information when examining individuals' rights vis-\u00e0 -vis the interest of society. 73 This multiplicity of interests will prompt courts to adopt a balanced approach when adjudicating on a person's rights, particularly whose interests of a State are involved.",

Although complete uniformity in privacy legislation may be a difficult objective to attain 74 (as has been the attempt to make other aspects of legislation uniform), it will be well worth the while of the international community to at least formulate international Standards and Recommend Practices (in the lines of the various ICAO Annexes) to serve as guidelines of State conduct. After all, as Collin Mellors pointed out: Under international agreements. . . privacy is now well established as a universal, natural, moral and human right. Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 17 of the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, all specify this basic right to privacy. Man everywhere has occasion to seek temporary \"seclusion or withdrawal from society\" and such arrangements cannot define the precise area of the right to privacy. 75 It is such a definition that is now needed so that the two requirements of ensuring respect for information about individuals and their privacy on the one hand, and the encouragement of free and open dissemination of trans-border data flows on the other, are reconciled.",

Globalization and increased migration across borders is gradually putting an end to the concept of the nation State, although resistance to reality can be still seen in instances where majority or dominant cultures impose their identity and interests on groups with whom they share a territory. In such instances, minorities frequently intensify their efforts to preserve and protect their identity, in order to avoid marginalization. Polarization between the opposite forces of assimilation on the one hand and protection of minority identity on the other inevitably causes increased intolerance and eventual armed ethnic conflict. In such a scenario, the first duty of governance is to ensure that the rights of a minority society are protected. would be the security of State. Inherent to the concept of security of State is State responsibility to its citizens and others who are in its territory. The fundamental issue in the context of State responsibility for the purposes of this article is to consider whether a State should be considered responsible for its own failure or non-feasance to prevent a private act of terrorism against civil aviation or whether the conduct of the State itself can be impugned by identifying a nexus between the perpetrator's conduct and the State. One view is that an agency paradigm, which may in some circumstances impute to a state reprehensibility on the ground that a principal-agent relationship between the State and the perpetrator existed, can obfuscate the issue and preclude one from conducting a meaningful legal study of the State's conduct. 77 At the core of the principal-agent dilemma is the theory of complicity, which attributes liability to a State that was complicit in a private act. Hugo Grotius (1583 Grotius ( -1645 , founder of the modern natural law theory, first formulated this theory based on State responsibility that was not absolute. Grotius' theory was that although a State did not have absolute responsibility for a private offence, it could be considered complicit through the notion of patienta or receptus. 78 While the concept of patienta refers to a State's inability to prevent a wrongdoing, receptus pertains to the refusal to punish the offender.",

The case 81 involved the Mexico-United States General Claims Commission which considered the claim of the United States on behalf of the family of a United States national who was killed in a Mexican mining company where the deceased was working. The United States argued that the Mexican authorities had failed to exercise due care and diligence in apprehending and prosecuting the offender. The decision handed down by the Commission distinguished between complicity and the responsibility to punish and the Commission was of the view that Mexico could not be considered an accomplice in this case. 77 Caron (1998 ) at 153-154 cited in Becker (2006a at 155. 78 Grotius and Scott (1646), pp. 523-526. 79 De Vattel and Fenwick (1916), p. 72. 80 Blackstone and Morrison (2001) The Complicity Theory, particularly from a Vattellian and Blackstonian point of view is merely assumptive unless put to the test through a judicial process of extradition.

The United Nations General Assembly, on 9 December 1999, adopted the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, 86 aimed at enhancing international co-operation among States in devising and adopting effective measures for the prevention of the financing of terrorism, as well as for its suppression through the prosecution and punishment of its perpetrators.",

However, as the case law cited in this article reflects, these measures have to conform to the constitutional guarantees given to citizens, one of which is the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In this context, the consent of the individual selected for a full body screen is essential and a full body scan taken by the State or an instrumentality of that State without a person's consent would tantamount to a breach of the Fourth Amendment. In the final analysis, however, the State is answerable to the public to show that it took every measure to avoid clear and present danger. The responsibility of a State for private acts of individuals which unlawfully interfere with civil aviation is determined by the quantum of proof available that could establish intent or negligence of the State, which in turn would establish complicity or condonation on the part of the State concerned. One way to determine complicity or condonation is to establish the extent to which the State adhered to the obligation imposed upon it by international law and whether it breached its duty to others. In order to exculpate itself, the State concerned will have to demonstrate that either it did not tolerate the offence (by using such measures as body scanners) or that it ensured the punishment of the offender. Brownlie is of the view that proof of such breach would lie in the causal connection between the private offender and the State. 93 In this context, the act or omission on the part of a State is a critical determinant particularly if there is no specific intent. 94 Generally, it is not the intent of the offender that is the determinant but the failure of a State to perform its legal duty in either preventing 92 Becker (2006b) at 335. 93 Brownlie (1983) the offence (if such was within the purview of the State) or in taking necessary action with regard to punitive action or redress. 95 A perceived inadequacy of the global framework of aviation security is the lack of an implementation arm. ICAO has taken extensive measures to introduce relevant international conventions as well as Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) in Annex 17 to the Chicago Convention. There is also a highly classified Aviation Security Manual developed by ICAO which is provided to States. Additionally, the Organization provides focused security training courses to its member States. However, ICAO's role is largely confined to rule making and the provision of guidance, bringing to bear the need for an aviation security crisis management team on a global scale that could work towards effectively precluding acts of terrorism.",

The Strasbourg Agreement was opened for signature by the member States of the Council of Europe on 26 October 1973. This agreement was designed to adapt the provisions of the Berlin Agreement concerning the conveyance of corpses, to the new situation arising from developments in the field of communications systems, international relations and commercial and tourist activities. A proposal to examine anew the problem of the transfer of corpses with a view to drawing up a new instrument was approved by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in 1967 and this task was entrusted to the European Public Health Committee which, in the course of its work, gave due consideration to the observations, among others, of the European Federation of Funeral Directors (Brussels) and the European Funeral Directors Association (Vienna). The text of the draft Agreement was submitted to the European Committee on Legal Co-operation (CCJ) before its final adoption by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in April 1973. It was opened for signature by member States of the Council of Europe on 26 October 1973.",

Also it was claimed that these two agreements imposed strict rules on the cross-border transfer of mortal remains, applied essentially to 'nonnationals' and hence ran counter to the Community scheme of things. Accordingly, and with a view to addressing the case where a Community citizen expired in a Community country other than his own and his remains had to be repatriated to his country, a Committee was appointed by the European Parliament to consider an instrument that addressed the conveyance of mortal remains suggested in Resolution 2003 /2032 . This Resolution noted that, on account of the above agreements, the death of a Community citizen in a Member State other than his country of origin results in more complex procedures, a longer period of time before burial or cremation takes place and higher costs than if the death had occurred in the deceased person's country of origin, Another compelling reason for this Resolution was the recognition that, in view of the growth in intra-Community tourism, the increasing numbers of retired people who choose to live in a country other than their own and, more generally, greater intra-Community mobility which is actually encouraged, the number of Community citizens who die in a country other than their country of origin was bound to increase. This was considered against the backdrop that Community citizens should, mutatis mutandis, be able to move between and reside in Member States in similar conditions to nationals of a Member State moving around or changing their place of residence in their own country, and that exercising the right to freedom of movement and freedom of residence should be facilitated to the utmost by reducing administrative formalities to an absolute minimum.",

            "text": "ICAO has approached this subject from another dimension i.e. the carriage of human remains of an aircraft accident victim. In 2001 the Council released its Guidance on Assistance to Aircraft Accident Victims and their Families 111 where ICAO recognizes that in an accident context the identification, custody and return of human remains are very important forms of family assistance but remains are often difficult to recover and identification can be an arduous and time consuming process. The ICAO guidance goes on to say that legislation often requires a post mortem examination of those killed in an accident and in some instances there may be remains that cannot be identified. 112 ICAO also calls for personal effects of the deceased to be correctly handled and returned to their lawful owners. 113 The Guidance also calls for the State of occurrence to provide for the return of human remains 114 while also devolving that burden-of the carriage of such remainsupon the aircraft operator involved in the accident. 115 Annexes 9 and 18 to the Chicago Convention There are two Annexes to the Chicago Convention which bear some relevance to the carriage of human remains by air-Annex 9 (Facilitation) and Annex 18 (The Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air). The Annex 9 definition of cargo implies that human remains could be categorized as cargo by giving the definition of cargo as \"any property carried on an aircraft other than mail, stores and accompanied or mishandled baggage\". This definition is slightly different from the one contained in another ICAO document-Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air 116 which defines \"cargo\" as \"any property carried on an aircraft other than mail and accompanied or mishandled baggage\". Annex 18 does not define the word \"cargo\" but defines \"dangerous goods\" as articles or substances which are capable of posing a risk to health, safety, property or the environment and which are shown in the list of dangerous goods in the Technical Instructions or which are classified according to those instructions. The Technical Instructions do not list human remains as being dangerous cargo. However, it behooves the international aviation community to inquire, along the lines of ICAO discussions in the Council, whether human remains could be ruled out as not posing a risk to health or the environment under any circumstances of carriage by air or whether human remains, depending on the way it is packed for transport, could be considered as dangerous goods. 117 Getting back to Annex 9, there is a whole chapter in the Annex-Chapter 4dedicated to the entry and departure of cargo and other articles. Surprisingly, there is no provision in the Annex for priority of clearance or transport of human remains over other cargo, despite the prominence given to the subject in ICAO Circular 285 -AN/166. 118 Another surprise is that, although there is a Recommended Practice in the Annex which suggests that electronic information systems for the release and clearance of \"goods\" (my emphasis) should cover their transfer between air and other modes of transport, 119 there is no definition of \"goods\" in the Annex. Do corpses or cremated human remains come under the purview of \"goods\"? This question is valid in the context of Appendix 3 to the Annex which has a template for a cargo manifest where there exists a column for \"Nature of Goods\". There is no mention of the word \"cargo\" in this template.",

If the spillage has occurred on an aircraft, the AHM provision advises the handler to only use cleaning materials suitable for aircraft use. He should not try to clean the body fluids by hosing with water or air and should use material that will adsorb the body fluids and scrape the material into a biohazard bag. Afterwards, he should wash the area with water/ disinfectant after removal of the adsorbent material, dispose of gloves and apron in a biohazard bag and wash hands thoroughly with soap and water afterwards.",
