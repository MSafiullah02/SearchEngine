No neoplasia was found within organs of the abdomen and/or the thorax. Instead granulomatous lesions, which appeared as white foci on cut surfaces were found in the liver, kidneys, abdominal lymph nodes and spleen, confirming feline infectious peritonitis. The cat also had pulmonary haemorrhage, oedema, myocardial necrosis and blood filled bladder indicating that this cat is likely to have had hyperviscosity syndrome secondary to its elevated globulins, which probably led to cardiac hypoxia, pulmonary haemorrhage, oedema and bladder haemorrhage. The cat did not have classic monoclonal gammopathy; rather, it had a polyclonal gammopathy. A possible explanation for the absence of monoclonal gammopathy is the presence of feline infectious peritonitis. The virus could have been present subclinically before the development of the plasma cell neoplasia, and feline infectious peritonitis became clinically apparent when normal immunoglobulin levels became severely depressed.",

This may be because the cause of haematuria was hyperviscosity syndrome rather than infection. In our experience one of the main differential diagnoses of multiple myelomas in cats is feline infectious peritonitis. Both may be presented with a similar clinical and haematological picture. The main differences were the identification of high levels of coronavirus titre; absence of Bence Jones protein in the urine and electrophoresis consistently produced polyclonal gammopathy in both blood and urine in feline infectious peritonitis.",
