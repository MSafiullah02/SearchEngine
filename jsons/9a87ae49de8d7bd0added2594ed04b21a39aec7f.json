The WHO estimates that DF and DHF together result in~500 000 hospitalizations and 15 000 deaths per year (http://www.who.int/ mediacentre/factsheets/fs117/en/).

Various strains of each serotype can cause severe disease. The four serotypes of DENV form a single species in the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae. 7 The DENV genome is an $11 kb single-stranded RNA molecule of positive polarity, containing a single open reading frame (ORF) flanked by 5 0 and 3 0 untranslated regions (UTRs). The ORF is translated into a single polyprotein that is co-and posttranslationally cleaved to produce 10 mature viral proteins. The UTRs contain conserved sequences and structures that have important roles in the regulation of many aspects of the viral life cycle, including translation, RNA synthesis and virion assembly. 8, 9 Dengue viruses are generally not pathogenic for mice. However, a number of murine models for the study of DENV exist, although none are thought to accurately mirror DENV pathogenesis in humans. 10 AG129 mice lack aand b-interferon and gamma interferon receptor genes, and therefore have a crippled innate immune system. Their adaptive immune system is considered to be functional, however, and they have been used successfully as a model system for DENV vaccine development. 11, 12 Certain strains of mouse-adapted DENV-2 can cause viraemia and can be detected at high titres in a number of tissues after intraperitoneal (ip) administration in AG129 mice. 11, 13, 14 AG129 mice infected with neuroadapted DENV-2 strain New Guinea C (NGC) or DENV-1 Mochizuki strain typically suffer 100% mortality by day 18 post-infection. 11, 12, 15 Recently, Schul et al. 14 showed that ip administration of unadapted DENV-2 can produce transient viraemia in AG129 mice and that antiviral drug candidates could be evaluated for their effect on viraemia and cytokine levels through blood testing.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 299, "end": 300, "text": "7", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 801, "end": 803, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 804, "end": 805, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1000, "end": 1002, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1281, "end": 1284, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1285, "end": 1287, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1462, "end": 1465, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1466, "end": 1469, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1470, "end": 1472, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1629, "end": 1632, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1633, "end": 1636, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1637, "end": 1639, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) are nonionic oligonucleotide analogues that contain the same four bases as DNA but possess a backbone composed of morpholine rings and phosphorodiamidate inter-subunit linkages instead of the deoxyribose and phosphodiester components of DNA. 16 Antisense PMO have been reported to be effective against both Ebola virus 17 and feline calicivirus 18 in vivo. PMO delivery into cells can be much improved through covalent conjugation to arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides (CPP). 19 ,20 CPPconjugated PMO (PPMO) have been shown to generate potent inhibition of DENV infections 21, 22 in cell cultures, and of West Nile virus (WNV), 23 poliovirus (PV), 24 murine coronavirus 25 and influenza A virus 26 infections, in both cell culture and mouse models.

A 20-mer 5 0 SL or 18-mer 3 0 CS PMO produced no significant treatment benefit, whereas 20-mer 5 0 SL or 18-mer 3 0 CS PPMO treated mice showed a statistically significant increase in survival time ( Figure 1 ). 5 0 SL and 3 0 CS PPMO of various lengths were then compared in cell culture for anti-DENV efficacy. PPMO of 22-24 bases were found to be the most effective, and able to reduce viral titres by several orders of magnitude when present at 1 mM in the cell culture medium. This antiviral effect was also greater than that reported previously for 5 0 SL 20-mer and 3 0 CS 18-mer PPMO that had been made with a different CPP ('P4'). In that earlier report, at 1 mM concentration, the P4-PMO exhibited no antiviral activity against DENV-2 D2/ IC-30P-A virus in Vero cell cultures. 22 5 0 SL and 3 0 CS 22-mer PPMO, which had produced high efficacy in the length versus activity evaluation, were then used in a second mouse study. With a higher number of doses and a longer time period over which dosing occurred than were employed in the first in vivo experiment, survival benefit of the antisense PPMO-treated groups again extended to an average of~1 week. For the second in vivo experiment, we had hypothesized that employing a greater number of doses with PPMO of more effective length during the first week post-infection, concomitant with a lower (but still severe) DENV-2 NGC challenge dose, would limit viral replication sufficiently to permit development of a fully protective anti-DENV-2 immune response. The PBS-treated group lived an average of 14 days in the second experiment compared with 9 days in the first experiment. In both experiments the effective PPMO produced up to a 7-8 day extension of survival time, and protection from DENV-induced weight loss for a period of about a week compared with controls (Figures 1 and 3 ). It is difficult to compare the in vivo results from this study with those obtained with other potential anti-DENV drugs, as there have been no reports in the literature (at the time of writing) of studies in which survival time was employed as an end-point in the evaluation of potential drugs using AG129 mice. The results here strongly suggest that 5 0 SL and 3 0 CS PPMO treatments suppressed viral titres in vivo for a period of several days, but that residual virus was able to rebound a number of days after treatment cessation. A similar pattern was also observed in the cell culture studies reported here and previously. 22 An alternate, and likewise untested, hypothesis is that virus resistant to the effects of the PPMO arose over time in response to the treatments. To date, however, there have been no reports in the literature of viral mutations arising in response to PPMO treatment in animals. Other investigators have sequenced virus from mice that had been treated with PPMO highly active in vivo against WNV 23 and PV, 24 and found no mutations in the PPMO-targeted regions.

A P7-PMO-Fl compound has previously been shown to be stable in human serum for at least 2 h. 30 Here, the PK profile was based on plasma concentration data monitored over 24 h following a single ip injection. Peak plasma concentration was observed at a T max of 0.67 h following injection, which is indicative of rapid transfer from the site of injection to the vascular space. The observed distribution half-life of~3 h, a high volume of distribution (Vd) and AUC, and detectable levels of PPMO-Fl observed in brain, liver and spleen at 0.2 h (10 min) post-dose all indicate that the PPMO-Fl distributed fairly rapidly into tissues. Tissue to plasma concentration ratios in liver (2.43) and spleen (0.72) at the T max provided a further indication that the PPMO-Fl rapidly penetrated into these tissues. Of the three tissues tested, liver was observed to be the primary site of accumulation, with brain accumulating minimal amounts of the compound. We assume that the higher perfusion of liver (11.8 mL/min in rats) compared to spleen (0.6 mL/min) and brain (1.3 mL/min) 42 contributed to the observed pattern. We attribute the low cerebral uptake to the presence of the blood brain barrier. As shown in Figure 6 (b), the level of PPMO-Fl in brain, liver and spleen did not change significantly for 3-5 days following the cessation of the 9 day treatment period. This observation indicates that these tissues retained the compound, and provides useful information for prospective dosing frequency in future studies. Although the liver is not considered a major target organ for DENV replication, the involvement of the liver in the pathogenesis of DENV infection has been documented. 43, 44 DENV antigens and RNA have been detected in various cells of the liver in humans. 43, 44 Safety assessment of the PPMO was based on changes in behaviour, appearance, body weight, serum chemistry panel and haematology in BALB/c mice after nine daily treatments. The only significant changes in serum chemistry or haematology during or after treatment were elevated serum cholesterol and a decrease in haematocrit, haemoglobin, packed cell volume and red blood cell (RBC) count. However, these changes did not appear to impact the overall health of the animals, and all of these indices reverted to levels comparable with the untreated control during the 5 day washout period, as shown in Figure 7 . The fact that total bilirubin was not altered during the treatment period suggests that the observed decrease in red blood cell count, haematocrit and packed cell volume was a result of interference with red blood cell production rather than haemolysis of these cells.
