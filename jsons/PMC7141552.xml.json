At the initial stages, Singapore, being the hyper-connected city that it is, was the country with the most confirmed COVID-19 cases outside of China (2). We are part of a large general hospital of 1800 beds with a 13-Bed Acute Palliative Care Unit and a busy inpatient referral and outpatient service. We are also situated next to the National Centre of Infectious Diseases where the majority of COVID-19 positive or suspected patients were housed. Consequently, clinicians from our palliative care team were deployed to help \u2018fight\u2019 in this nation-wide healthcare crisis.",

Those who were in the \u2018dirty\u2019 wards usually isolated themselves from the rest of the team and often ate alone. So much of palliative care is about the camaraderie of being together as a team, these regular routines of team meeting provided the peer support which invariably strengthens us from burnout and builds resilience (3).",

These fears and questions are no different from our palliative care patients who suffer and experience these same feelings and emotions. The families suffered along with them. Often anxious, worried and burdened and because of the \u2018No visitor policy\u2019 in the hospital for this group of patients, they could only contact their loved ones online or on the phone. Many cried in the loneliness of their rooms.",

But the principles of holistic care which palliative care embodies so well (4) still apply. For instance, empowering our clinicians to manage physical symptoms, spending time on the phone (through a stained glass window) to care for their psychological needs, and comforting and encouraging these patients. For those of us who had to move from our usual line of work in palliative care into the frontlines of fighting this epidemic, the echoes of the words of Sheila Cassidy (5) rings clear and true \u2013 that we in palliative care are here, walking \u2018through the darkness\u2019 with you.",
