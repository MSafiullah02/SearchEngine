            "text": "The potential of RNA viruses to adapt to new environments relies on their ability to introduce changes in their genomes, which has resulted in the recent expansion of re-emergent viruses. Chikungunya virus is an important human pathogen transmitted by mosquitoes that, after 60 years of exclusive circulation in Asia and Africa, has rapidly spread in Europe and the Americas. Here, we examined the evolution of CHIKV in different hosts and uncovered host-specific requirements of the CHIKV 3'UTR. Sequence repeats are conserved at the CHIKV 3'UTR but vary in copy number among viral lineages. We found that these blocks of repeated sequences favor RNA recombination processes through copy-choice mechanism that acts concertedly with viral selection, determining the emergence of new viral variants. Functional analyses using a panel of mutant viruses indicated that opposite selective pressures in mosquito and mammalian cells impose a fitness cost during transmission that is alleviated by recombination guided by sequence repeats. Indeed, drastic changes in the frequency of viral variants with different numbers of repeats were detected during host switch. We propose that RNA recombination accelerates CHIKV adaptability, allowing the virus to overcome genetic bottlenecks within the mosquito host. These studies highlight the role of 3'UTR plasticity on CHIKV evolution, providing a new paradigm to explain the significance of sequence repetitions.",

So far, how genetic bottlenecks act in concert with host selective pressures to shape the composition of CHIKV populations remains unclear.",

            "text": "Sequence comparisons of RNA viruses from different groups show that those that must cycle between host species have a more diverse 3'UTR than others with a single host [26] . In this regard, we have previously introduced the concept that 3'UTR duplications of complex RNA structures provide mosquito-borne flaviviruses with the means to efficiently switch between hosts maintaining high viral fitness [27, 28] . Here, based on the heterogeneity of the 3'UTR of circulating CHIKV, we hypothesized that the number of sequence repetitions can change to accelerate viral adaptation during continuous host cycling. We found that the 3'UTR of CHIKV populations is highly dynamic in cell culture and during the infection of laboratory mosquitoes, recapitulating the observations in natural isolates. Genetic diversity of viral populations depends both on CHIKV lineage and the infected host cell, indicating that CHIKV 3'UTR is under conflicting selective pressures in mosquito and mammalian cells. Our studies suggest that CHIKV uses genetic recombination at the 3'UTR to generate virus populations with diverse 3'UTRs. This strategy allows CHIKV to overcome bottlenecks in nature, driving the generation of new viral variants that rapidly replace the existing ones during adaptation to the host. Altogether, our findings provide important insights into the function of CHIKV 3'UTR plasticity for host cell adaptation, pointing out a central role of RNA recombination on CHIKV ongoing evolution.",

Interestingly, ECSA and Asian CHIKV lineages differ at their 3'UTRs. ECSA lineage contains two DR elements at the 3'UTR, namely DR1 (two copies) and DR2 (three copies), while the Asian 3'UTR accumulated insertions and point mutations around the DR1 and DR2 [hereafter designated as DR (1+2)], plus the duplication of an entire region (DR3) ( Fig  1A) [21] .",

In 2005, a CHIKV derived from ECSA lineage expanded the infection in La Reunion Island and then passed to the European continent. More recently, in 2016, a new autochthonous transmission of CHIKV derived from ECSA lineage was described in Brazil and Haiti [31] [32] [33] [34] . ECSA-derived isolates contain simple 3'UTRs, with only two copies of DR 1 and DR2 (Fig 1B) . In contrast, Asian-derived isolates, which arrived to America in 2013, contain longer 3'UTRs. Some American CHIKV isolates (such as the Caribbean) bear 3'UTRs that have never before been described in nature [17] . These novel 3'UTRs display a 177-nt duplication corresponding to the 3' portion of the DR(1+2)a region plus an extra copy of the complete DR(1+2)b region (Fig 1B) . It has been proposed that this duplication confers an advantage for viral replication in mosquito cells compared to the original Asian strain [17] .",

            "text": "Ongoing CHIKV epidemics are caused by viruses from ECSA and Asian lineages, which contain differences both in their coding and non-coding regions. As mentioned, the CHIKV responsible for 2005-2006 epidemics in La Reunion Island (CHIKV-LR; ECSA-derived) contained a single mutation in the envelope protein gene (E1-A226V) that increases viral fitness in Aedes albopictus [15, 35] , which is not present in the CHIKV that arrived to America [CHIKV-Caribbean (Cbn); Asian-derived]. Besides, both linages largely differ at their 3'UTRs. To identify sequence repetitions at the 3'UTR from these two distinct re-emergent viruses, RNA matrix comparisons were performed. Local alignment plots confirm the presence of multiple DRs at both 3'UTRs, but with distinct repetition patterns (Fig 2A) . Firstly, we studied the impact of distinct 3'UTRs on replication by comparing growth kinetics of CHIKV-LR and CHIKV-Cbn in mammalian (BHK and human fibroblasts) and mosquito cells. Growth curves in mammalian cells showed that both viruses replicated similarly, despite a slight advantage of CHIKV-LR over the CHIKV-Cbn for replication in human fibroblasts ( Fig 2B) . In contrast, CHIKV-Cbn exhibited enhanced growth kinetics in Aedes albopictus C6/36 cells, resulting in 10-fold higher titers compared to CHIKV-LR. To assess the contribution of the 3'UTR to the differential behavior in insect cells, we designed chimeras containing the 3'UTR from CHIKV-LR in the context of the CHIKV-Cbn genome and vice versa. Equal amounts of RNA transcripts from parental and chimeric viruses were individually transfected into BHK or C6/ 36 cells. Then, virus replication was monitored by immunofluorescence as a function of time and virus growth curves ( Fig 2C) . In BHK cells, similar levels of replication were observed for parental and chimeric viruses of both LR and Cbn lineages, demonstrating that neither the virus backbone nor the 3'UTR play lineage specific functions and that the 3'UTR may be swapped between viral isolates. On the other hand, in mosquito cells the 3'UTR from CHIKV-Cbn provided CHIKV-LR a net advantage for replication, displaying increased percentage of infected cells at two days after transfection and enhanced growth kinetics compared to the parental virus ( Fig 2C) . In contrast, the 3'UTR from CHIKV-LR disfavored replication of CHIKV-Cbn in the same cell line (Fig 2C) . So far, our results indicate that CHIKV-Cbn contains a 3'UTR advantageous for viral replication in C6/36 cells but without benefit for replication in different mammalian cells.",

To address these questions, we investigated whether viral populations of re-emerging CHIKV are prone to change during passaging in cell culture. We first followed the evolution of the 3'UTR of viruses restricted to replicate in mammalian or mosquito cells. Viral RNA molecules were obtained by in vitro transcription from CHIKV-Cbn infectious clone and used to transfect C6/36 and BHK cell lines in two parallel experiments ( Fig 3A) . Viruses recovered from the transfection supernatants were serially passaged in mosquito or mammalian cells. Then, total RNA was extracted from culture supernatants and used as a template for reverse transcription reactions with an oligo(dT) primer. The pool of viral cDNAs was used to amplify fragments corresponding to the 3'UTR ends and then cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector. Individual plasmid clones were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and sequenced using Sanger method.

            "text": "Viral variants carrying deletions at their 3'UTR appeared in CHIKV populations. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism responsible for the generation of these new viral variants. It is accepted that RNA recombination contributes to genetic diversity of many RNA viruses, impacting on their evolution, epidemiology and re-emergence [6, 36] . RNA deletions are often generated during RNA recombination by a copy-choice mechanism. This process involves dissociation of the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase and the nascent strand from the RNA template, and their re-association at a different position of either the original RNA or template switch to a homologous RNA, guided by sequence similarities (Fig 4A, i and ii, respectively). Template switching from a donor to an acceptor strand generates a chimeric RNA molecule. Given the fact that CHIKV contains various copies of sequence repetitions at its 3'UTR, we reasoned that 3' variability could be originated by a copy-choice mechanism. To differentiate between re-association on the same or an alternative template molecule, we introduced point mutations into CHIKV-Cbn infectious clone in order to generate recognition sites for two unique restriction enzymes at the boundaries of the 3'UTR. Thus, when the RNA marked with the restriction sites is mixed with parental unmarked RNA, recombination between homologous RNAs by template switching will generate a chimeric 3'UTR carrying only one of the marker sites. We engineered SacI and NheI restriction sites at positions 1-6 and 858-863 after the translation stop codon. The recombinant CHIKV-Cbn SacI/NheI was infective in both mammalian and mosquito cells (Fig 4B) . To visualize the presence of SacI and NheI sites, fragments corresponding to the last 1,500 nucleotides of the viral genome were obtained by PCR and separately digested with the two restriction enzymes (S3 Fig) . The fragment amplified from the recombinant virus was sensitive to both SacI and NheI digestion, and the introduced mutations were stable in cell culture even after 5 successive passages (Fig 4B, right panels). Then, to evaluate template-switching events, equal amounts of RNA transcripts for the parental and CHIKV-Cbn SacI/NheI were co-transfected into cultured cells. At day 3 after transfection, total RNA was extracted from culture media, used as a template for reverse transcription reactions and cloned. The presence of SacI and NheI sites was assessed by enzymatic digestion of PCR products amplified from individual clones. For confirmation, the 3'UTRs were also sequenced and relative abundances of viral variants were calculated. About 15% and 50% of the viruses recovered from mosquito and mammalian cells, respectively, contained full-length 3'UTRs with only one of the two restriction sites (Fig 4C and 4D ). The emergence of these new recombinant variants, that were absent in the input mixture of RNAs, strongly suggests that they were products of a template switching mechanism generated by a polymerase that jumped from a RNA to the same position of a homologous RNA.",

Because replication of \u0394(1+2)abb' virus was only evident after 10 days, we asked whether To mark the CHIKV-Cbn RNA, SacI and NheI restriction sites were introduced at the 5' and 3' ends of the viral 3'UTR, respectively. Immunofluorescence of Cbn-WT and Cbn-SacI/NheI viruses were performed in BHK and C6/36 cells. Viral RNA was recovered from the supernatant, and fragments corresponding to the last~1,500 nucleotides of the viral genome were obtained by RT-PCR, digested with SacI and NheI restriction enzymes and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Undigested (-) and digested (+) products are shown on the right panel for parental (WT) and marked (SacI/NheI) viruses. Also, we show the digested products for one representative individual clone of SacI/ NheI virus containing full-length 3'UTR, which was isolated after 5 passages in C6/36 cells (red asterisks). For P5, 20 clones were tested and they all conserved both SacI and NheI restriction sites. (C and D) Cbn-WT and Cbn-SacI/NheI RNAs were co-transfected at a 1:1 ratio into C6/36 and BHK cells, in duplicates. At 72hpt, supernatants were harvested, subjected to RT-PCR and blunt-end cloned. For each experiment, 14 individual clones were subjected to PCR reactions, enzymatic digestion, and resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. To illustrate, undigested and digested products from 7 representative clones are shown. Depending on the orientation of each inserted fragment into the blunt plasmid, digestion of SacI positive clones generated 430 or 372 nucleotide-length products and digestion of NheI positive clones generated 186 or 146 nucleotide-length products. Presence of SacI and/or NheI restriction sites are indicated with yellow and light blue stars, respectively. Individual clones are also schematized and deletions are indicated with orange and red lines. Recombinant clones generated by template switching between strands are indicated with a R. Relative abundance of each virus is represented in pie charts (bottom). Unmarked WT 3'UTRs are indicated in grey, marked 3'UTRs sensitive to SacI and NheI digestion in light blue, and 3'UTRs that are only sensitive to SacI digestion in yellow.",

Analysis of clones corresponding to the \u0394(1+2)abb' population showed that the 3'UTR remained stable, suggesting that a minimum of DR copies may be maintained to favor recombination. In agreement with the immunofluorescence results, assessment of virus replication by growth curves showed that \u0394(1+2)ab and \u0394(1+2)abb' exhibited delayed replication kinetics, resulting in 300 and 10,000 fold lower titers as compared to the WT, respectively (Fig 5A) . Deletion of one DR3 copy was also evaluated in mosquito cells and it was found to delay viral replication, with 10% of the monolayer infected at day 1 and 100-fold reduction in viral titer compared to the WT. Replication of all mutants and WT viruses was similarly investigated in mammalian cells and interestingly, deletion of DR copies had no significant effect on viral fitness (Fig 5A, bottom panel; and S4 Fig) . Taken together, our results indicate a remarkable difference for replication requirements in mosquito and mammalian cells, with an evident positive correlation between the number of DR copies and replication rates in mosquito cells. In addition, DR(1 +2) copies cannot compensate for the deletion of DR3, suggesting that DR(1+2) and DR3 copies are functionally different. In fact, DR1 and DR2 do not fold into stable RNA structures. Because DR3 folds into a stable SLY (Fig 1D) , it is tempting to speculate that this structure plays a role on viral replication in mosquito cells.",

We reasoned that host switch by alternate passaging of the virus in mammalian and mosquito cells would impact on the frequency of deletion variants. The CHIKV-Cbn grown in mammalian cells, where 64% of the viruses bear deletions in the 3'UTR was used to infect mosquito cells (Host Switch I, Fig  6A) .

Our experiments reveal that populations of CHIKV are greatly dynamic and the copy number of sequence repetitions at the 3'UTR varies continuously when the virus shuttles from mosquito to mammalian cells. Indeed, sequence repetitions act as functional blocks that are gained or lost during cycling to accelerate viral adaptability. Interestingly, duplication of complex RNA structures is a common feature of the 3'UTR among other RNA viruses that must cycle between hosts [26, 37] . However, we have only recently obtained experimental insights into the function of duplicated structures for DENV, showing that duplication of a 3' structure is beneficial in mammalian cells [27] . Here we uncovered the requirements and the underlying mechanism that maintain sequence duplications during CHIKV host cycling. Although there are evidences that support that sequence duplications at the 3'UTR provide RNA viruses with the means to replicate in hosts with conflicting demands, our results highlight the differences related to viral biology. We propose a model where RNA recombination and natural selection act concertedly to shape the composition of CHIKV populations (Fig 8) . One example is the outcome of CHIKV-Cbn experimental adaptation to mammalian cells (see experiment II in Fig 3) , where the same deletion variant was isolated with high frequency. This can be explained by an early single recombination event followed by positive selection during passaging in cell culture.",

            "text": "RNA recombination is driven by blocks of repeated sequences and is the main mechanism underlying genome plasticity at the 3'UTR in both mosquito and mammalian hosts. While positive selection favors the replication of advantageous viral variants, RNA-recombination does not always produce beneficial rearrangements of the viral genome. In fact, RNA recombination yields both viable viruses and non-replicative viral RNAs that are packaged into defective interfering particles [38] [see Fig 8A) and 8B)]. The Cbn strain missing DR3a and DR3b copies isolated in BHK cells is an example of those non-replicative RNAs. In turn, viable viruses are subjected to positive selection processes in each host, according to specific requirements for viral replication. Direct repeats at the 3'UTR are under different host-selective pressures. While they are advantageous for replication in mosquito cells, they are rather redundant in mammalian cells. These conflicting requirements explain why viral variants enriched in DR copies are positively selected in mosquito cells, and then cleared out when the virus switches to mammalian cells. However, the cause for selection of viral variants with disparate 3'UTRs in different hosts still remains unclear. In the case of DENV, we discovered that host adaptation modulates the species of non-coding RNAs derived from the 3'UTR (known as sfRNA) that are accumulated in infected cells [28] . A number of studies have revealed important functions of sfRNAs, including the evasion of immune responses [39, 40] . Evidence so far suggests that during CHIKV infection no sfRNAs are produced [41] . In turn, alphavirus 3'UTR in the context of the complete viral genome appears to be the target for antiviral responses in mammalian cells: (i) CHIKV 3'UTR is specifically recognized by RIG-I receptors, that sense viral infection to initiate and modulate antiviral immunity [42] and (ii) Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) contains at its 3'UTR a binding site for a vertebrate-cell specific miRNA that restricts viral replication [43] . Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that loss of DR copies at the 3'UTR serves as a mechanism to evade host antiviral response in mammalian cells. Future work is required to elucidate whether immune escape is the driving force for CHIKV 3'UTR evolution.",

Following this line of thought, we explain the evolution of CHIKV during host switch under two possible scenarios: \"tight\" or \"wide\" genetic bottlenecks. In light of our experiments, we propose that under \"wide\" genetic bottlenecks the mammalian-adapted population undergoes a purifying selection to remove the variants with lower fitness in mosquitoes. On the other hand, \"tight\" genetic bottlenecks reduce genetic diversity. Variants with higher fitness in mosquitoes are underrepresented in the mammalian-adapted population and may not go through the bottleneck, posing a constraint to viral replication. In this scenario, RNA recombination can generate new viral variants that are positively selected in mosquitoes, working as an efficient strategy to rescue CHIKV from \"tight\" genetic bottlenecks or even providing an advantage for viral replication [Fig 8(C) and 8(D) ].",

Comparable effects of 3'UTR deletions on CHIKV replication were also observed in C6/36 cells and mosquitoes (Figs 5A,6A and Fig 6B) . Overall, our study confirms previous reports showing the requirement for repeated DR elements for efficient replication in mosquito [17, 21, 22] .

Products from RNA recombination are proposed to impact on viral evolution and adaptation [56] [57] [58] . A strong evidence of alphavirus recombination is the emergence of Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV), which arose from a recombination event between Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) and a Sindbis-like virus. Also, RNA recombination at the 3'UTR of Sindbis virus (SINV) has already been reported, where the conserved sequence element CSE along with the poly (A) tail have been proposed to play a role. Contrarily to our findings with CHIKV, RNA recombination of SINV RNA is not dependent on sequence homology. Instead, cryptic polymerase recognition motifs promote non-homologous template switching between viral and non-viral templates [59, 60] . It appears that, although stimulated by different RNA determinants, RNA recombination is a founding mechanism that generates diversity at alphaviruses 3'UTR.",

The strength of base pairing regions between the donor and the acceptor RNA strands is believed to modulate genome propensity for this process. In this regard, not all viral variants have the potential to generate diversity through RNA recombination. For instance, previous studies show that CHIKV-La Reunion carrying the deletion of both DR1 and both DR2 copies does not introduce changes at the 3'UTR during adaptation. Instead, it acquires compensatory mutations in protein coding regions, so as to improve viral fitness in mosquito cells [22] . It seems reasonable that a minimum number of DR copies should be maintained to drive RNA recombination between homologous strands. Here, although bearing certain sequence variations, we have detected recombination events when viruses containing the 3'UTR from different CHIKV lineages coexist in the same cell. During outbreaks, coinfections of mosquitoes and patients with different arboviruses have been extensively documented, supporting the notion that simultaneous exposure of mosquitoes to multiple arboviruses during one feeding episode is highly frequent [ [62] [63] [64] [65] , for review see [66] ]. Given the fact that ECSA and Asian derived lineages co-circulate in the same geographic areas [17, [31] [32] [33] [34] , we propose that RNA recombination may occur in mosquitoes that are simultaneously infected with different CHIKV lineages, resulting in the emergence of new viral variants. The ability of viral genomes to recombine within mosquitoes could clearly have implications on CHIKV epidemiology and evolution.",
