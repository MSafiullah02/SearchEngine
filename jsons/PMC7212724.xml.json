Finally, all surgical services can revert to normal with the advent of a vaccine or effective therapy. This phased approach allows for a cautious introduction of surgical services while keeping health care workers safe, surgical disease, and COVID-19 at check. It will safe guard patient needs and prevent huge backlogs that would overwhelm the health care systems in Asia and may potentially result in unwanted outcomes in the form of morbidity to mortality.",

Aerosolization during laparoscopy is held as the most common reason for holding back laparoscopic surgery during COVID-19 outbreak. However, surgical plume results from tissue desiccation and thus the use of an electrocautery even in open surgery is potentially hazardous. Studies have shown that activated virus like, HIV and Papilloma virus can be found in surgical smoke that is blown away by the CO2 in laparoscopy and thus potentially infective [5, 6]. Also, hepatitis B virus has previously been demonstrated to be present in surgical smoke from HBV positive patients [7]. Erring on the side of caution, due to limited data on the use of laparoscopy in COVID-19 patients, many societies have cautioned against the use of laparoscopy [8, 9]. Li et al. in their study had shown that for the same energy device activated for 10 min during traditional open surgery versus laparoscopic surgery, the particle concentration of the smoke in laparoscopic surgery was significantly higher owing to low gas mobility in the pneumoperitoneum [10, 11].",

This ensures that at least two full gas exchanges of the OR are taken and enhances safety in the very unlikely chance that the surgeons are operating on an undiagnosed COVID-19 case [13]Trainee\u2019s participation in surgery is best not done as an operating surgeon given that it will delay surgery and may potentially risk complications and safety issues may arise [11]The operating rooms ideally should be one as descried by Ti et al. [14]. An OR with a negative pressure environment located at a corner of the operating complex, and with a separate access, is designated for all confirmed (or suspected) COVID-19 cases. Only the ante room and anesthesia induction rooms have negative atmospheric pressures. But for countries with limited resources, an alternate OR complexes separated from the main OR can be identified for COVID-19 patients, thus avoiding contamination of other ORs.Judicious use of PPE which includes a N-95 mask for high risk cases, impervious gown, double gloves, shields or goggles are recommended along with non-perforated shoes or rubber boots [15].No definitive evidence that PAPR reduces likelihood of viral transmission for potential airborne infections [16].Use regional anesthesia where possible to reduce intubation and general anesthesia related riskEffective communication between the operating team, anesthetist and support staff is of paramount in helping to reduce operating time and improving safety.Surgical plume needs to be removed effectively. During open surgery consider use of electrocautery pencil with suction.Team changes will be required for prolonged procedures in full PPE [17].Adequate disposable of waste at the end of surgery.During shifting of suspected COVID-19 patient to an outside recovery area or intensive care unit, handing over to a minimum number of transport personnel who are waiting outside the OR should be considered [18].Personal protective equipment during transport should be not be the same as worn during the procedure [18].Continued education on the occupation hazard and updates on new research will help real time adjustment of protocols.",

Purse-string suture or disposable trocar with skin blocking system should be usedC.Disposable trocars should be used as reusable trocars may contain virus load after cleansingD.Pneumoperitoneum creation should be undertaken using a technique that one is most familiar with. The Veress needle is a good choice where expertise exists. An optical trocar to gain access can be used too, otherwise, Hasson\u2019s technique with a good seal with prevention of air leak is importantE.Pneumoperitoneum should be maintained at a lower pressure (10-12 mm of Hg) and low flow rate of gas insufflationF.All pneumoperitoneum should be safely evacuated via a filtration system before trocar\u2019s removal, port site closure, specimen extraction or conversion to open surgeryG.Avoid using two-way pneumoperitoneum insufflators to prevent pathogen colonization of circulating aerosol in pneumoperitoneum circuit or the insufflatorH.Prevent creation of plume byMinimizing energy device usage and avoid its prolonged activationFor endo-laparoscopic electrocautery set power at lowAvoid long dissecting time at same spot using the device to reduce surgical plumeSuction frequently to avoid accumulation of plume in the intra-abdominal cavityKeep instruments clean of blood and tissues and operating surface dry to minimize plume formation.I.Smoke evacuationPassive or Active Filtration Should be utilized.Use of commercially available smoke evacuating system is encouraged. The specification of the filtration is an important consideration in COVID-19 as the virus itself measures approximately 0.12 microns and systems like RapidVacTMsmoke evacuator system by Medtronic uses an ultra-low particulate air filter (ULPA) that can remove 99.99% of the particles that are 0.12microns or more in diameter.Where a commercially available system can\u2019t be obtained due to cost or licensing issues a DIY technique that uses a draining tube connected to a ventilating port on the abdominal side and then to an underwater seal containing a virucidal solution like CIDEX\u00ae that connects to suction device can be used.Standard electrostatic filters used for ventilation offer 99.99% effective protection against HBV and HCV which have a diameter of 42 nm and 30\u201360 nm, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 has a larger diameter of 70\u201390 nm therefore according to an accepted publication of Mintz et al. [19] the filter can be connected via standard tubing to the trocar evacuation port to constitute an evacuation and filtering system which evacuates the generated smoke, as well as filters the potential viral load to ensure surgical staff safety without the need for active suction.J.The use of more complex integrated systems like the IES3 Erbe, Conmed Airseal system\u00ae,Megadyne Mega Vac Plus or MiniVac, S-PILOT Karl Storz are recommended where resources are availableK.The use of disposable instruments where possible is advisable. Reusing disposables, is not approved due to concerns over sterility and the clinical consequence of residual viral load [20, 21]L.Reusable instrument\u2019s reprocessing durability must be considered as they are subject to wear and tear. The use of reusable instruments may be wary about quality reducing over time, insufficient sterility and equipment failure [22]M.Watch out for sharp instruments and handle with care as a prick may damage protective equipmentN.Use surgical drains only if strictly necessaryO.Teach and practice safe surgery",
