In fact, there are several groups of influenza viruses, which are proved to be the causes of respiratory tract infections in human beings as well as in other animals. In human beings, the influenza virus infection can be seen worldwide with a wide range of epidemic areas. Each year, million illnesses are reported. As a virus, the possible mutation can be expected, and any sense mutation can result in new problematic virus. The new atypical influenza virus can be the cause of new disease that can cause the worldwide pandemic.[12]",

Antiviral drug is useful for not only getting rid of the infection but also controlling of disease spreading. The standard treatment for swine flu is similar to the classical influenza. The drug of choice is oseltamivir.[19] According to the interim guideline published by CDC,[25] standard dosage of oseltamivir as used for general influenza infection case should be applied. Nevertheless, until present, there is still no report on the efficacy and effectiveness of oseltamivir in treatment of new H7N9 influenza. For supportive treatment of cases with pneumonia, oxygen therapy and non-invasive mechanical ventilation should be considered.[19]",
