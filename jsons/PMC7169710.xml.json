For oral RBV, dosing ranged from 800 to 1800 mg daily; for reference, recommended dosing for hepatitis C virus ranges from 800 to 1400 mg daily (weight\u2010based dosing). Oral RBV for RSV therapy is an off\u2010label use, and little information is available to define the appropriate dose. In the available literature, dosing strategies vary, and include non\u2010weight\u2010based and weight\u2010based regimens ranging typically from 15 mg/kg/day to 22.5 mg/kg/day 4, 10, 11, 12, 13. Inhaled RBV is approved for use in children at a dose of 6 g aerosolized over 12\u201318 h. This long duration of nebulization can be difficult to tolerate and often disrupts other patient care activities. Limited data suggest than an intermittent dosing schedule is equal, in terms of safety, and may be superior in preventing progression to LRTI 14. This alternative intermittent dosing schedule of 2 g aerosolized every 8 h (typically for a 2\u2010h period with each administration) was the most commonly used regimen in our survey.",

A systematic review suggested benefit in terms of decreased progression to LRTI and mortality with administration of inhaled RBV plus monoclonal (palivizumab) or polyclonal antibody preparations (IVIG, RSV\u2010IVIG) 8. Other retrospective studies in HSCT populations have shown similar results 2, 9. Evidence for the efficacy of oral RBV is more limited; however, some retrospective studies suggest that it is well tolerated in HSCT and lung transplant recipients 4, 10, 11, 13. In the same systematic review noted above, oral RBV in combination with IVIG and/or palivizumab was associated with lower rates of progression to LRTI and mortality, although the effect was not as pronounced as that seen with inhaled RBV combined with immunomodulators (IVIG, RSV\u2010IVIG, and/or palivizumab) 8. Of note, RSV\u2010IVIG is no longer commercially available. A study aimed at determining the efficacy of RSV\u2010IVIG for prophylaxis of RSV infection in allogeneic HSCT recipients was unable to determine benefit 15. Likewise, palivizumab is costly and has not proven to be efficacious in preventing progression of URTI to LRTI, or reducing mortality in adult allogeneic HSCT recipients 6, 16.",

Furthermore, studies evaluating the use of oral RBV suggest that it is equivalent to inhaled RBV for treatment of RSV in lung transplants 4. In non\u2010lung SOTs and in patients with hematologic malignancy, most centers would not treat URTI, which is consistent with Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommending against routine treatment of RSV URTI in neutropenic patients 18.

While inhaled RBV was used more commonly, no consensus existed regarding its use compared to oral RBV or regarding the use of IVIG. Given the potential severity of RSV infection in adult immunocompromised patients, this variability demonstrates the critical need for well\u2010designed studies examining currently used and novel agents. Attempts at randomized studies examining the efficacy of inhaled RBV in the past have not been successful owing to poor enrollment and perhaps reluctance to accept a placebo arm, and we would not advocate repeating that effort. Larger multicenter non\u2010interventional trials could better identify risk factors for poor outcomes and identify populations most likely to benefit from expensive and potentially toxic therapies such as inhaled or oral RBV. The issue, however, may be solved as new therapies are tested and approved. ALN\u2010RSVO1, a topically administered small interfering RNA; GS\u20105806, an oral fusion inhibitor; and MDT\u2010637, an inhaled viral fusion inhibitor, are in various stages of development and provide hope that a proven effective treatment will soon be available 6, 19, 20, 21.
