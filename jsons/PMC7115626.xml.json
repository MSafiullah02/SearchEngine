            "text": "Chronic inflammation is a common and important factor in the pathogenesis of neoplasmas. Inflammation is often accompanied by the excessive formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that are potentially damaging to DNA and cell membranes. In addition, the expression of COX-2 in inflammatory and neoplastic cells has an impact on various carcinogenic pathways [1], [2], [3], [4]. NSAIDs usefulness in chemoprevention is well-documented. Numerous experimental, epidemiological, and clinical studies have found that long-term use of NSAIDs is associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer, adenomatous polyps, and some other types of cancer [5], [6], [7], [8]. NSAID chemical modifications were undertaken with the aim of improving the NSAIDs safety profile (increasing the analgetic/anti-inflammatory activity and COX1/COX2 selectivity, reducing the ulcerogenic effect or obtaining dual COX/LOX inhibition) [9], [10]. Many efforts were made to get NSAID derivatives with pronounced cytostatic activity as well [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. Thus, we set to prepare a series of new NSAID derivatives rich in nitrogen/oxygen atoms, related to semicarbazides, carbazides, ureas, hydroxyureas and hydroxamic acids, bearing pharmacophores present in numerous antitumor agents [20], [21], [22], [23]. Their synthesis, full chemical characterization, and evaluation of their cytostatic, antiviral and antioxidative potential are reported in this paper.",

The panel cell lines were inoculated onto a series of standard 96-well microtiter plates on day 0, at 1 \u00d7 104 to 3 \u00d7 104\n cells/ml, depending on the doubling times of a specific cell line. Test agents were then added in ten-fold dilutions (10\u22128\u201310\u22124\n M) and incubated for further 72 h. Working dilutions were freshly prepared on the day of testing. After 72 h of incubation the cell growth rate was evaluated by performing the MTT assay, which detects dehydrogenize activity in viable cells. The absorbance (A) was measured on a microplate reader at 570 nm. The absorbance is directly proportional to the number of living, metabolically active cells. The percentage of growth (PG) of the cell lines was calculated according to one or the other of the following two expressions:If(meanAtest\u2212meanAtzero)\u22650,thenPG=100\u00d7(meanAtest\u2212meanAtzero)/(meanActrl\u2212meanAtzero).\nIf(meanAtest\u2212meanAtzero)<0,thenPG=100\u00d7(meanAtest\u2212meanAtzero)/(Atzero),where the mean A\ntzero is the average of optical density measurements before exposure of cells to the test compound, the mean A\ntest is the average of optical density measurements after the desired period of time and the mean A\nctrl is the average of optical density measurements after the desired period of time with no exposure of cells to the test compound. The results are expressed as IC50, which is the concentration necessary for 50% of inhibition. The IC50 values for each compound are calculated from concentration\u2013response curves using linear regression analysis by fitting the test concentrations that give PG values above and below the reference value (i.e. 50%). If however, all of the tested concentrations produce PGs exceeding the respective reference level of effect (e.g. PG value of 50), then the highest tested concentration is assigned as the default value, which is preceded by a \u201c>\u201d sign. Each test was performed in quadruplicate in at least two individual experiments.",

The tested compounds do not discriminate very much between the different tumor cell lines regarding their cytostatic activity, except for the human mammary carcinoma MCF-7 cells that are generally more sensitive to the antiproliferative activity of the compounds than the other carcinoma cell lines (Table 1). The most active compounds 4-benzhydryl-1-[2-(3-phenoxyphenyl)propanoyl]semicarbazide (5l), 4-benzhydryl-1-[2-(3-benzylphenyl)propanoyl]semicarbazide (5s), and 4-benzhydryl-1-[2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoyl]semicarbazide (5f) inhibited tumor cell proliferation at IC50 values ranging from 3 to 23 \u03bcM. It is striking to observe that those three most active compounds consistently contain the same unique structural motif (i.e. a 4-benzhydryl-1-propanoyl-semicarbazide), whereas lack of any bulky aromatic or cycloalkyl group resulting in a free end-standing \u2013CONHNH2 or \u2013CONHOH group virtually annihilates the cytostatic activity. Thus, the presence of a bulky lipophilic group, preferably a benzhydryl group, is strictly required at this terminal end. It would be interesting to introduce additional substituents on the benzhydryl moiety (i.e. alkyl, alkoxy, halogene, amine, carboxylic acid and/or hydroxyl groups) to further explore the cytostatic potential and selectivity of these test compounds. The NSAID terminal of these molecules seems to be less important (i.e. isobutyl, phenoxyphenyl, benzyl) to determine the antiproliferative potency. It would be also interesting to explore an additional SAR by modifying the latter part of the molecule.",

All other compounds generally showed the same inhibitory effect toward tumor and non-tumor cell lines, except toward breast cancer cells MCF-7, which were shown to be slightly more sensitive.

Promotion is closely linked to oxidative and inflammatory tissue damage. Conversely, substances with potent anti-inflammatory and/or antioxidant activities are anticipated to exert chemopreventive effects on carcinogenesis, particularly in the stage of promotion and to act as antitumor promoters. Taking under consideration the above mentioned as well as the antioxidant and cytostatic activities of our compounds, it seems that three out of five of the most active LP inhibitors are the strongest antiproliferative agents as well. These findings support the idea that the cytostatic activity of 5l, 5s and 5f is highly correlated to their antioxidant potential (anti-lipid peroxidation activity).",

LOX inhibitors have attracted attention initially as potential agents for the treatment of inflammatory and allergic diseases, certain types of cancer, and cardiovascular diseases [41], [42]. In order to diminish the pro-cancerous mechanisms a key treatment strategy is to reduce the free radical load. Antioxidant activity by the scavenging of reactive oxygen species is important in preventing potential damage to cellular macromolecules such as DNA, proteins and lipids. Moreover, it has been found that LOX inhibitors may have chemopreventive activity in lung carcinogenesis [43]. Reports published over the past three decades support a growth-regulatory role of arachidonic acid metabolites in the etiology of mammary carcinogenesis [44]. Studies have demonstrated that levels of several eicosanoids are increased in breast cancer in comparison to benign breast tumors [45].",

The tested compounds varied very much in cytostatic activity. All intermediate products 3a\u2013c, 6 and 7 displayed no or very weak inhibitory activity against proliferation of all the tested tumor cell lines. Opposite to some reports [49], [50], carbazides 8d\u2013f with the pharmacophore \u2013CONHOH identified in hydroxamic acids and hydroxyureas, where also completely inactive, while their O-benzyl derivatives 8a\u2013c showed a slightly better activity with IC50 values ranging from 19 to 105 \u03bcM. Semicarbazides with a free (5w\u2013y) or a benzyl protected hydroxy group (5t\u2013v) showed no or low activity as well. However, 5-acylsemicarbazides 5a\u2013s bearing cycloalkyl or aryl substituents (cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cyclohexylmethyl, benzyl, phenylethyl, benzhydryl) at position 4 exerted a cytostatic activity against all examined malignant  tumor cell lines, with a slight selectivity to MCF-7. In particular, the benzhydryl-substituted compounds showed the most pronounced cytostatic potential. Indeed, 5l and 5s, both bearing the highly lipophilic benzhydryl group, showed marked antiproliferative activity in vitro against a variety of cancer cell lines (IC50\n = 3\u201319 \u03bcM). The same compounds profoundly inhibited soybean lipoxygenase and lipid peroxidase (81\u201399%). The ibuprofen benzhydryl analog 5f was slightly less active with IC50\n = 6\u201323 \u03bcM cytotoxicity, 46% inhibition of LOX and 74% LP inhibition, respectively.",

However, compound 7 showed the best DPPH interaction value (85%) from all the tested compounds. The highest LP inhibition showed compounds 5t, 8c and 5l, followed by 5s and 5f. Our results indicate that LP inhibitory activity is not always accompanied by DPPH radical scavenging activity. Compounds 5s, 5l and 5j showed as the best LOX inhibitors. The cytostatic activity of 5l, 5s and 5f is highly correlated to their antioxidant potential. The compounds depict the same activity pattern, which may suggest similar mechanisms of action correlated to their antioxidant activities. The results of our biological tests point to compounds 5s and 5l as the leading compounds for further derivatization in our search for effective antiproliferative and LP/LOX inhibitory agents. A further detailed study of antioxidant activity of 5s and 5l, along with the elucidation of specific target(s) and pathway(s) that mediate these activities, especially in a breast cancer model, should be the next steps toward novel antioxidant/chemopreventive compounds discovery.",
