            "text": "While the focus of this work is the public response to framing infectious diseases, this study also adds to the larger debate regarding domestic public opinion as a factor that affects the national and foreign policy decisions of governments in an increasingly interconnected world (Fearon 1998; Powlick 1995; Risse Kappen 1991; Beuno de Mesquita 2002; Jacobs and Shapiro 2000) . A body of scholarly work has debated the role of public opinion in foreign policy decision-making in democratic societies. The discussions have centered on the role of the public in foreign policy decision-making, that is, whether public opinion follows, determines, or sets some limits on leaders who avoid making policies that might later evoke \u201cpublic retribution\u201d (Price 2009) . Much of the early literature of the two decades after the Second World War, as represented by the works of Walter Lippmann , Hans Morgenthau , and Gabriel Almond , posits a rather pessimistic view of public opinion on domestic and foreign policy issues\n(Lippman 1922; Morgenthau 1956; Almond 1956). Studies on public opinion on foreign policy issues were concerned mainly with matters such as war, military intervention abroad, nuclear arms policy, international trade, defense spending, and foreign aid. Policy makers perceived these issues to be far removed from peoples\u2019 lives, and the public was disinterested in these issues. Added to this was the belief that some of the foreign policy issues required secrecy, speed, and flexibility in the use of classified information (Holsti 1992). Decision makers, therefore, felt that there was little need to engage public opinion, which they considered to be erratic, unstable, emotional, and volatile (Almond 1956).",

In the post-Cold War era, researchers such as Richard Sobel , James Larson , Bruce Jentleson , Rebecca Britton , Eugene Wiittkoph, Miroslav Nincic, Bruce Russett, Ronald Hinckley, Peter Feaver, Christopher Gelpi, and Richard Eichenberg studied issues like public tolerance of war casualties, international trade, and military involvement (Jentleson 1992) .

            "text": "On this issue, the relationship between public opinion and foreign policy in the United States takes on increased significance (Holsti 2004). First, although scholars agreed that while some issues, such as military conflicts and resulting domestic costs and war casualties, attracted intense public attention, public opinion was, in general, considered to be important only in so far it had electoral implications (Potter and Baum 2010; Price and Zaller 1993) . The public was assumed to be more easily manipulated on issues of wars and military crises abroad than on domestic issues, which affected them directly (Domke et al. 2006). The need for speed and secrecy in issues of war and military confrontation were often used as justification by policy makers for denying public engagement in foreign policy decision-making. The same rationale, however, cannot be used for policy making on an issue such as infectious diseases. On the contrary, on this issue policy makers consider an active, informed, and engaged public to be important, and public cooperation is actively sought. Infectious diseases are a major source of concern to people and government alike. They are potentially transferable from one person to the other and can cause death and disability, impose high health care costs, lead to loss of productivity, and thereby cause social and economic disruption (World Health Organization 2004). Due to the transmissibility of infectious diseases and their direct impact on people, any public health intervention, support for surveillance, or policy decisions regarding funding, prevention, and control of global infectious diseases requires the active engagement of the American public. Secondly, on issues of war and military crisis, local actors, including the executive branch of the government, members of the Congress, interest groups, media, and often academia, have traditionally dominated the elite discourse.3\n",

Many organizations that transcend national boundaries, including multinational corporations, pharmaceutical companies, epistemic communities, and civic society organizations (e.g., Health Action International), have also enriched and participated in the debate on global and national health policies (Walt et al. 2004; Loewenson 2011). To influence public opinion and enlist support for their proposed policies these organizations emphasize different dimensions of infectious diseases (e.g., human rights and economic and biomedical issues) and frame issues in ways that strategically emphasize their political positions (Nisbet and Lewenstein 2002). On this issue, therefore, the public is exposed to frames espoused by domestic, transnational, and international organizations.",

            "text": "Within the context of this persistent debate, there was agreement among scholars of public opinion and foreign policy about the sources of information about international events and foreign policy issues and the accessibility of this information to the public. Because many ordinary citizens were inattentive to international affairs and foreign news, public opinion about foreign policy issues often was activated through elite discourse (e.g., policy-making elite and opinion leaders) and by the media (Page 1996). Extensive research has shown that the media is most able to activate opinion when these elite debates are presented as \u201cframes\u201d to which people are particularly receptive and which seem to have an impact on people\u2019s lives (Powlick and Katz 1998). The concept of \u201cframing\u201d and \u201cframing effects\u201d has been studied widely in the social sciences (Scheufele and Tewksbury 2007; Scheufele 2006). Studies of agenda setting and framing as developed in research on social movements, communication, and foreign policy all suggest that public opinion may be shaped by the way in which an issue is framed (Gamson and Modigliani 1987). Framing may be seen as an attempt by leaders and other actors to insert into the policy debate-organizing themes that will affect how the public and other actors such as the media will perceive an issue.4 Framing effects occur when the media\u2019s decision to highlight or emphasize only certain aspects of an issue causes individuals to base their views and opinions on these salient aspects (Gamson and Modigliani 1987).",

Scholars also have shown that frames may not necessarily be oppositional in nature and that audiences may adopt only a portion of frames (Gross and Ambrosio 2004). In other words, they might embrace mixed frames. There is no consensus among scholars about which frames will appeal most to the public and why some frames are more successful in persuading audiences when presented as part of multiple frames (Payne 2001). The above review indicates there is no consensus among scholars if any frame is effective in all situations, and some feel that only an \u201coperational approach of asking people directly to evaluate the relative strength of various frames\u201d will allow assessment of frame strength (Chong and Druckman 2007). Hence it becomes relevant to use a research method that gives an understanding of evolving frames that are issue-based or content frames and assess their impact on public opinion (Scheufele 2006; Entman 2003; Baumgartner and Leech 2001).",

Many previous studies conducted to understand framing effects had several flaws. Most of these studies were conducted as laboratory experiments, although some involved focus groups (Chong et al. 2001). First, when conducted as laboratory experiments, they lacked external validity (Barabas and Jerit 2010). Since the study was done under strictly controlled conditions it was very difficult to generalize the result in outside settings and to general populations (Campbell and Stanley 1996). Second, in most of these studies, subjects were exposed to single frames. In simple laboratory experiments the researcher strictly controlled the experiments and randomly assigned participants to these groups (Shanto and Kinder 1987). Participants were exposed to contrasting frames one after the other, and then their opinion was recorded. The researchers could gauge which frame was most influential in changing opinion of participants (Nelson et al. 1997). This kind of study had two limitations. One, the experimenters were not able to determine what kinds of reactions would be evoked if subjects were exposed to dual or multiple frames at the same time, as usually happens in the real world. Second, these studies in the absence of a control group failed to gauge the impact of either frames when experimenters did not expose them to contrasting frames that run in opposite directions (Druckman 2011). These studies, therefore, were also unable to establish which kinds of frames were more powerful or influential in determining public preference for one frame over the other (Chong and Druckman 2010). In response to this concern, scholars (Sniderman and Theriault 2004; Aldrich et al. 2006)\nstudied framing in competitive environments in which individuals were exposed to dual frames in equal quantities in controlled laboratory experiments. These scholars set out to prove that exposure to more than one frame would neutralize or cancel the effect of the other frame\n(Sniderman and Th\u00e9riault 2004). These studies, however, failed to explain why in some cases one frame could be more influential than another. The studies also were conducted as laboratory experiments and thus were subject to the same criticisms of external validity. They failed to capture the effects of the manifold, complex, and variegated framing environments that citizens face in the real world (Kinder 2007). In more recent studies, subjects were exposed to multiple frames in varying quantities at the same time.5 These studies were conducted either in an experimental setting or in a non-experimental setting like focus groups or by combining content analysis of news reports with survey research to understand the effects of framing on public attitudes\n(Wise and Brewer 2010; Mira 2003). Other studies showed that in such a competitive environment, some frames were more persuasive than others and not all frames were successful in changing public opinion (Druckman 2010). These findings, however, indicated that in a very competitive environment, framing results were not as powerful as they were when subjects were exposed to single frames in laboratory settings.",

Public opinion poll data are used to present a measure of the public reaction to these frames. This research method not only addressed limitations of past studies, but it also was the best method that could help me understand evolution of frames and framing effects on respondents. By relying on content analysis and public opinion data, I could address some of the above-mentioned limitations of past studies on framing effects that involved participant observation, interviews, focus groups (Chong 1993), and laboratory studies (Kinder 2007).

I could capture an evolving debate on policies and discussions around transnational infectious diseases from 2001 to 2007 and analyze a large amount of data. Second, compared to other research methods like participant observation, controlled laboratory experiments, focus group studies, and interviews, conducting content analysis was an unobtrusive method (Blackstone 2012). Unobtrusive methods are those where the data collector does not interfere in any way with the participants and respondents of the study (Krippendorff 2013). This prevents a bias on the part of the researcher and results obtained are fair and truly acknowledge the role of media frames. Third, it was an inexpensive method and solved my problem, like many other researchers who are unable to leave homes and travel to gather research data. I used Lexis Nexis Academic database to retrieve content. While students and researchers need to be trained in the use of the database, it is still a very inexpensive research method. Most universities and research institutions provide this database and research can be conducted without requiring extensive funding for fieldwork and conducting experiments and interviews. Polling data for the study including public opinion polls was also easily accessible, and available (Krippendorff 2013).",

Shifts in public opinion toward infectious diseases were assessed by considering exact and similarly worded questions about issues related to avian flu, HIV/AIDS, and SARS (Ho et al. 2007). Specifically, these questions measured the following: (a) willingness to support harsh public health measures such as quarantine to curb the spread of disease; (b) precautionary steps taken and behavioral changes made in personal lives due to fear of the disease; and (c) concerns about the spread and likelihood of contracting the disease. Positive responses to these questions would indicate a higher level of awareness and concern about the disease in response to media coverage of these diseases.

Both the security and human rights frames affected opinion and increased public support for policies intended to prevent or treat HIV/AIDS. My analysis produced three major findings. First, the biomedical frame was the dominant frame in all three case studies, and the economic frame was the second most represented frame. The human rights and security frames were less prominent in all the three case studies.

This finding supports Shanto Iyengar\u2019s observation that repeated exposure to a frame, such as frequently hearing a news story emphasizing economic losses, increases the accessibility of the frame and enhances its effect (Iyengar 1990). When any concept is recently or frequently repeated, it comes quickly to one\u2019s mind when making judgments on policy (Fiske and Taylor 2008; Liberman et al. 2007). Other frames, even if they did not appear most frequently, apparently prompted concern over the disease because they were perceived to be more relevant or stronger frames. In this fashion, the economic frame may have increased public anxiety about SARS when coverage pertained specifically to the United States. The findings of this study are generally consistent with those of Paul Brewer, David Wise , Paul Sniderman , and Sean Theriault, who posited that framing results are not as robust when respondents are exposed to dual or multiple frames, compared with single frames\n(Wise and Brewer 2010; Sniderman and Theriault 2004)\n. On the other hand, this study of infectious disease framing does not support the claim that exposure to competing frames necessarily mitigates the impact of any one frame. As Rodger Payne puts it:No frame is an omnipotent persuasive tool that can be decisively wielded and it would be virtually impossible to know in advance if an apparently compelling frame in one situation would also prove persuasive when applied to an analogous case.
