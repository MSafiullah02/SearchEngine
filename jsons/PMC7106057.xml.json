            "text": "Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a negative single-stranded RNA virus, belonging to the Metapneumovirus genus of the Pneumovirinae subfamily of the Paramyxoviridae family (van den Hoogen et al., 2002). First identified by van den Hoogen and colleagues in 2001, HMPV is a causative agent of acute respiratory tract infections (van den Hoogen et al., 2001). Primarily at risk of severe HMPV-related disease are infants, immunocompromised patients and the elderly (Boivin et al., 2002, O\u2019Gorman et al., 2006, Sivaprakasam et al., 2007, van den Hoogen et al., 2004b, van den Hoogen et al., 2003, Williams et al., 2005). Infection with HMPV can be both symptomatic and asymptomatic (Bruno et al., 2009). Clinical manifestations of symptomatic HMPV are indistinguishable from those of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and range from mild upper respiratory tract infection to severe disease requiring hospitalisation. Re-infection with HMPV is common and currently there is no vaccine available. Although reports have confirmed the global circulation of HMPV, data from tropical countries, especially Asia, remains limited. Similar to other pneumoviruses, HMPV virions are surrounded by a lipid membrane into which three transmembrane surface glycoproteins are inserted: the attachment glycoprotein (G), the fusion protein (F) and the small hydrophobic protein (SH) (Collins and Mottet, 1993, Skiadopoulos et al., 2006). HMPV strains can be classified on the basis of genetic variability within the F and G genes. Two HMPV genotypes have been identified, A and B, both of which can be divided further into the distinct sub-genotypes B1, B2, A1, A2 (van den Hoogen et al., 2004a). In addition, the sub-genotype A2 comprises two lineages, A2a and A2b (Huck et al., 2006, Ishiguro et al., 2004).",

Not only can the incidence of HMPV infection vary from year to year, but it is now well understood that HMPV epidemics are highly localised and community based; that strains of both genotypes, all sub-genotypes and lineages can circulate concurrently within a given location during a given season (Kahn et al., 2008, Papenburg and Boivin, 2010, van den Hoogen et al., 2004b). Furthermore, in localised HMPV epidemics worldwide, the predominant circulating strains can vary annually. In order to generate a globally effective vaccine, the genetic heterogeneity of circulating HMPV must be well understood. Here we report the results of the first study to investigate the seasonality and genetic variability of HMPV strains circulating in Cambodia.",

The aim of the SISEA project was to investigate the prevalence of endemic and emerging pathogens in South-East Asia. Between June 2007 and December 2009, a total of 3858 samples were collected from patients admitted with symptoms of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) to Takeo (southern Cambodia) and Kampong Cham (central-east Cambodia) provincial hospitals. For patients aged  < 5 years, ALRI was defined as an illness of  < 10 days duration that consisted of cough or difficult breathing, plus tachypnea. For patients aged between 5 and 14 years, case definition included the above symptoms as well as a fever  \u2265 38 \u00b0C. For patients aged 15 years or older ALRI was defined as a fever  \u2265 38 \u00b0C, plus chest pain or tachypnea or auscultatory crackles (WHO, 2005). A severe case for patients  < 5 years of age was defined as ALRI in addition to: respiratory rate  \u2265 60/min (age  < 2 months),  \u2265 50/min (age  < 11 months), or  \u2265 40/min (ages between 1 and 5 years), oxygen saturation  < 93%, cardiac frequency  > 180 beats per minute (bpm) for infants  < 1-year-old or  > 140 bpm amongst the 1\u20135 years age group, clinical respiratory distress, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines (WHO, 2005).

Cambodian and reference HMPV nucleotide sequences were aligned using the Clustal W alignment program of Mega software, version 4.0 (Tamura et al., 2007). The average pairwise Jukes\u2013Cantor distance was found to be 0.08 and 0.6 for the HMPV F and G alignments, respectively, indicating that the data were suitable to construct Neighbour-Joining trees (Nei and Kumar, 2000). Trees were constructed using the p-distance nucleotide substitution model, with 1000 bootstrap replicates, using Mega 4.0 software. An avian metapneumovirus (AMPV) type C strain (DQ009484) was used to root both HMPV F and G phylogenetic trees. The nucleotide sequences of HMPV strains obtained in this study were deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers HQ864230\u2013HQ864312.",

As all of the Cambodian patients investigated in this study required hospitalisation, the low incidence of HMPV infection could reflect a reduced capacity of HMPV to cause severe disease in the study population. Indeed, as nearly all children have been infected with HMPV by 2 years of age with only a minority requiring hospitalisation, a large proportion of HMPV infections in older children and adults are mild or asymptomatic (Falsey et al., 2003). The incidence of HMPV infection amongst Cambodian outpatients was unfortunately not investigated. Therefore, that we observed low incidence of HMPV amongst the population studied may also have resulted from a bias in recruitment since the study only investigated patients with severe illness and did not include outpatients with mild disease. It must also be noted that sampling frequency may have influenced detection of HMPV incidence amongst the Cambodian population studied. Sampling increased sharply during 2009 due to the H1N1 influenza pandemic, hence the increased number of samples collected and tested may have resulted in an underestimation of HMPV incidence.",

            "text": "However, although estimates of prevalence and seasonality can vary according to many factors, including the population studied and the methodology used, it is now accepted that circulation of HMPV between and within given populations is highly variable (Aberle et al., 2008, Falsey et al., 2003, Ludewick et al., 2005, Oliveira et al., 2009). Indeed, in this study, the annual prevalence of HMPV infection varied from 4.3% in 2008 to as low as 0.2% and 0.3% in 2007 and 2009, respectively. During the seasonal peak in 2008, between July and September, infection with HMPV accounted for 10% of all respiratory infections. Hence changes in the prevalence of HMPV between consecutive seasons, as observed in this study, are consistent with observations made by others, specifically, high and low incidence of infection alternating between consecutive years (Carneiro et al., 2009, Falsey et al., 2003, Hopkins et al., 2008, Huck et al., 2006, Ludewick et al., 2005, van den Hoogen et al., 2004a). In addition, timing of the annual seasonal peak of HMPV infection has been observed to vary. In a retrospective study conducted in Austria, Aberle et al. reported a yearly shift in the peak occurrence of HMPV infections, alternating biennially between spring and winter, and that this pattern was sustained over the 20-year period investigated (Aberle et al., 2008). We were unable to comment on the seasonality of HMPV infection in Cambodia, on account of the very low number of HMPV positive samples detected during 2007 and 2009 (Fig. 1). Despite this, in 2008, the peak of infection did occur during the rainy season, between May and September (Fig. 1). Similar to HRSV, the peak incidence of HMPV infection is thought to occur during the rainy season in tropical countries, as HMPV and HRSV typically circulate concurrently resulting in seasonal overlap (Garcia-Garcia et al., 2006, Gerna et al., 2005, McAdam et al., 2004, Noyola et al., 2005, Olsen et al., 2010). Furthermore it was observed, consistent with the findings of Oliveira et al. (2009), that HMPV circulated throughout the year, resulting in a small number of sporadic infections during the 3 consecutive years investigated (Fig. 1A).",

            "text": "To investigate the genetic variability of HMPV strains in Cambodia, regions of the fusion (F) and attachment (G) glycoproteins were analysed. Both F and G proteins are expressed on the surface of virus particles and infected cells. However due to its essential function, resulting in a high level of conservation and antigenic relatedness between regions of the protein amongst genotype A and B strains, only the F protein is able to elicit potent neutralising antibody responses that although typically homologous, can also be cross-protective (Ryder et al., 2010, Skiadopoulos et al., 2006, Skiadopoulos et al., 2004, Ulbrandt et al., 2008). Analogous to the findings of similar studies, a high degree of similarity at both the nt and aa levels was observed for the F gene sequences analysed in this study (Boivin et al., 2004, Endo et al., 2008, van den Hoogen et al., 2004a, Yang et al., 2009). In contrast, the G protein is highly genetically and antigenically diverse, and the least conserved region amongst HMPV strains (Endo et al., 2008, Galiano et al., 2006, Skiadopoulos et al., 2006, van den Hoogen et al., 2004a). Despite functioning as an attachment glycoprotein, Biacchesi and colleagues demonstrated that following deletion of the G glycoprotein, attenuated HMPV isolates retained the ability to replicate in vivo albeit at a reduced rate (Biacchesi et al., 2004). Hence the high rate of nucleic acid substitutions, insertions and deletions observed within this region occur potentially as the attachment glycoprotein is non-essential for HMPV replication. Potentially as a result of the high level of HMPV G gene sequence diversity between strains, successful amplification of fewer HMPV G sequences, compared with the number of HMPV F sequences obtained, was achieved in this and other studies (Pizzorno et al., 2010, van den Hoogen et al., 2004a).",

Van den Hoogen and colleagues reported not only a similarly low rate of G protein sequence homology, but, analogous to the findings of this study, that variation was higher at the aa level compared to the nucleic acid level (van den Hoogen et al., 2004a). The level of nucleotide and amino acid diversity observed amongst G sequences of Cambodian sub-genotype B2 and lineage A2b strains was similar to published reports (Ishiguro et al., 2004, Ludewick et al., 2005). It is widely accepted that the high level of aa sequence variation occurs as a result of targeted immune pressure due to the prominent location of the G protein on the surface of the virus particle (Endo et al., 2008, van den Hoogen et al., 2004a).",

Similar to the results obtained previously in Thailand, we observed that sub-genotype B2 strains clearly predominated and that lineage A2b and sub-genotype B1 strains co-circulated in Cambodia between 2007 and 2009 (Fig. 2). Similar to (Loo et al., 2007), no HMPV sub-genotype A1 strains were detected in this study (Loo et al., 2007). Indeed, globally, circulation of HMPV genotypes has been observed to vary annually, according to geographical location. Predominant genotypes are replaced every 1\u20133 years within a given population, which is thought to occur upon development of adaptive immunity to infection with strains of the predominating circulating genotype (Aberle et al., 2010, Carneiro et al., 2009, Chung et al., 2008, Hopkins et al., 2008, Huck et al., 2006, Mackay et al., 2006, Oliveira et al., 2009, Williams et al., 2010). As the majority of strains analysed in this study were collected in 2008 (89%), we need to exercise caution when commenting on subgroup changes of HMPV in Cambodia. Indeed, in 2009 although specimens positive for sub-genotypes B1 and B2, and lineage A2b were detected, only four samples were collected, hence it is not possible to comment on whether this represented a shift in predominant circulating HMPV genotypes.",

It is thought that the high incidence of HMPV/HRSV co-infection occurs as the annual epidemics of both viruses partially overlap, especially in temperate climates (Papenburg and Boivin, 2010). In this study, 9.2% of HMPV positive specimens were co-infected with an additional virus, with HMPV/adenovirus co-infections the most frequently detected. A similar incidence of HMPV/adenovirus co-infection was observed in children with respiratory tract infection in Japan (Kaida et al., 2007). All of the HMPV/adenovirus co-infected patients identified in this study were aged 2 years or less, which is not surprising as primary adenovirus infections typically occur in very young children (Lenaerts et al., 2008). One patient identified in this study was co-infected with HMPV and HBoV. The co-infected patient was not classified as having severe illness. The role of HBoV as a causative agent of respiratory tract disease remains contentious (Blessing et al., 2009, Chow and Esper, 2009, Mackay, 2007, Schildgen et al., 2008). A recent study by (Blessing et al., 2009) demonstrated that qualitative detection of HBoV DNA within a patient sample was not sufficient to establish HBoV as the sole cause of respiratory illness. This was due to prolonged shedding and persistence of HBoV DNA over an extended period (Blessing et al., 2009). Hence, the clinical relevance of detection of HBoV DNAin this co-infected patient identified in this study remains unclear. Interestingly, despite concurrent high circulation of HRSV during each rainy season within the same population (Buchy, Personal communication), co-infection with HMPV and HRSV was not detected in this study. The incidence of HRSV infection amongst the population investigated was similar to that reported both regionally, and similar to that reported for studies conducted worldwide (data not shown).",

            "text": "Pneumonia and broncho-pneumonia were the most frequent diagnoses amongst all of the age groups studied. These syndromes are commonly used in other studies as indicators of severe illness (Falsey, 2008, Ulloa-Gutierrez et al., 2004, van den Hoogen et al., 2003, Vicente et al., 2006). In a 25-year retrospective study of HMPV infection amongst young children treated at an outpatient clinic in the USA, bronchiolitis was the most frequent clinical expression of HMPV infection, and pneumonia was observed in only 8% of children (Williams et al., 2004). However, of 12 HMPV cases detected during 2 years in Thailand, 11 (91%) patients required hospitalisation. Amongst the hospitalised patients, the primary manifestation (50%) of HMPV infection was also pneumonia (Samransamruajkit et al., 2006). Similarly, amongst a population of children aged  < 5 years hospitalised with ALRI symptoms in Israel, Wolf and colleagues reported a strong association between HMPV infection and pneumonia (Wolf et al., 2006). Although the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying this association were unclear, the authors speculated that infection with HMPV might exacerbate or be involved in the pathogenesis of bacterial pneumonia (Wolf et al., 2006). Co-infection with HMPV and an additional respiratory pathogen, virus or bacteria, has been associated with more severe illness compared with HMPV mono-infection (Cuevas et al., 2003, Semple et al., 2005). In this study, comprehensive testing for co-infection with bacteria could not be performed as appropriate patient samples were largely not available or were contaminated, and therefore unsuitable for testing. Of 17 Cambodian patients with severe illness and hyperleukocytosis, 8 (47%) were diagnosed with pneumonia or bronchopneumonia. It would be interesting to further examine the association between bacterial pneumonia and HMPV infection.",

            "text": "Five patients, with a normal leukocyte count and severe illness, were all aged  < 10 years with no detected viral co-infection. Of these, 3 patients were infected with lineage A2b strains. No difference in the severity of disease following infection with HMPV strains of the A and B genotypes has been reported (Agapov et al., 2006, Xiao et al., 2010). However conversely, and similar to the findings of this study, an association between HMPV genotype A strains and severe disease has also been observed (Esper et al., 2004, Martinello et al., 2002, Vicente et al., 2006). Although not all of the patients infected with lineage A2b strains experienced severe illness, we did observe a statistically significant (p\n \n = \n 0.013) association between infection with lineage A2b strains and severe illness in children with no known co-infections or underlying co-morbid conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a significant association between infection with HMPV lineage A2b strains and severe illness. Similarly, an association between severe disease and infection with genotype A strains of the closely related Paramyxovirus HRSV has also been observed, relative to infection with HRSV genotype B strains (Gilca et al., 2006, Martinello et al., 2002, Sullender, 2000, Walsh et al., 1997). However, we cannot rule out the possibility of nosocomial infection amongst hospitalised patients, or prior infection with other respiratory infections as factors which may have contributed to the severity of illness amongst the patients infected with sub-lineage A2b strains identified in this study. Additional studies recruiting a larger number of patients are required to further address the question of whether infection with HMPV sub-lineage A2b strains is associated with severe disease,. In addition, the circulating genotypes amongst a Cambodian outpatient population infected with HMPV should also be investigated, to elucidate whether the same genotypes are associated with less severe infection.",
