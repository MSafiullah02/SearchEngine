            "text": "Arboviruses present an ongoing challenge to medicine and public health. Chikungunya virus was first isolated in Africa in the 1950s at the border of Tanzania and Mozambique. Chikungunya fever is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Clinically, it resembles dengue fever and several other arboviral diseases, but is more frequently associated with arthralgia [2]. For 50 years, the virus was confined to sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. Although it generally occurred in the form of large and brutal epidemics affecting non-immune populations, it was classified as a mildly pathogenic arthropod-borne virus, and was rated as \u2192emerging\u2018 by the Institute of Medicine in 1992. The situation changed abruptly in 2005\u20132006, when a strain of Chikungunya virus entered the South West Indian Ocean Islands and adapted rapidly to mosquitoes of the species Aedes albopictus through a mutation in the envelope gene of the virus. The E1 A226V mutation is associated with increased replication capacity in this worldwide-disseminated and invasive vector. Since 2005, the epidemics in the Indian Ocean, India and Southeast Asia have accounted for millions of cases locally, and have resulted in thousands of imported cases in Europe and the Americas. No autochthonous case was recorded there, most probably because of the seasonal asynchronicity with the southern hemisphere. The 2007 Italian outbreak of Chikungunya fever (205 laboratory-confirmed cases) was fuelled by a unique patient returning from northern India (north hemisphere) during the viraemic phase of the infection. Later, Chikungunya virus autochthonous transmission was demonstrated in south-eastern France, with two confirmed cases in September 2010 [3].",
