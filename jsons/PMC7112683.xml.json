            "text": "IFN-\u03b2 was the first key responder of innate immune response against viral infections (Muller et al., 1994, Weber et al., 2004). When virus infected, the virus RNA could be recognized by the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as membrane bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and the melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 protein (MDA5). Among these receptors, TLRs recruited the adaptor molecule myeloid differentiation primary-response gene 88 (MyD88) and Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN (TRIF) while RIG-I and MDA-5 recruited virus-induced signaling adapter (VISA), to make TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) or I\u03baB kinase-\u025b (IKK-\u025b) phosphorylate IRF-3 and finally to induce IFN-\u03b2 transcription (Bowie and Unterholzner, 2008). Then, IFN-\u03b2 induced the IFN-regulated genes responsible for the antiviral response (Sadler and Williams, 2008). However, during the co-evolution with the host cells, many viruses encoded proteins that inhibited the interferon production, making it difficult for host cells to defeat viral infection (Bowie and Unterholzner, 2008, Spann et al., 2004, Weber et al., 2004).",

PRRSV shared many features with other members of the Arteriviridae viruses such as mouse lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), equine arteritis virus (EAV) and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). Since the emergence of PRRSV in the United States in 1987 and in Europe in 1990, PRRSV has caused one of the most economically important diseases of swine which was characterized by severe reproductive failure in sows and respiratory distress in piglets and growing pigs (Rossow, 1998). Infection with PRRSV also subjected pigs to secondary infection by bacterial and viral pathogens, which may be due to the immunosuppression induced by the virus (Feng et al., 2001, Mateu and Diaz, 2008).",

Our previous study and others have found that PRRSV suppressed IFN-\u03b2 production induced by Poly(I:C) (Luo et al., 2008) and that nsp1, nsp2 and nsp11 from PRRSV were the IFN antagonists (Beura et al., 2010, Shi et al., 2010). Sun et al. (2010) found that ubiquitin-deconjugating activity of nsp2 antagonized the type I interferon. Our recent study found that the papain-like cysteine protease of nsp1\u03b1 was necessary for nsp1 as the interferon antagonist (Shi et al., unpublished results). However, up to now, the mechanism that nsp11 inhibited IFN-\u03b2 production was still unclear.",

The crystal structures of NendoU-containing nsp15 of several coronaviruses revealed that the active sites of NendoU included two histidines and a lysine (Ricagno et al., 2006, Xu et al., 2006). And site-directed mutagenesis studies showed that mutation of one of the three amino acids could abolish the nucleolytic activity (Guarino et al., 2005, Ivanov et al., 2004). Nedialkova's study showed that nsp11 from the arterivirus, EAV, also had the catalytic center (His-126, His-141 and Lys170) and mutating one of the three amino acids could abolish the endoribonuclease (NendoU) activity (Nedialkova et al., 2009). Aligning the protein sequence of NendoU domain among SARS-CoV nsp15, EAV nsp11 and PRRSV nsp11 (Fig. 2\nA), the active sites of PRRSV NendoU should be His-129, His-144 and Lys-173.",

A mutagenesis study of EAV nsp11 indicated that deleting parts of the NendoU domain from nsp11 of EAV was lethal and replacement of any of the three putative catalytic residues (His-126, His-141, or Lys-170) reduced plaque sizes and reduced yields of infectious progeny (Posthuma et al., 2006). And the in vitro study showed that replacement of any of the three putative catalytic residues (His-126, His-141, or Lys-170) reduced the EAV NendoU activity to background levels (Nedialkova et al., 2009), which was consistent with the results of inactivated endoribonuclease in other Nidovirales (Guarino et al., 2005, Ivanov et al., 2004, Xu et al., 2006). Mutation studies that inactivated the endoribonuclease activity in coronavirus indicated that endoribonuclease was required for optimal infection by virus (Ivanov et al., 2004, Kang et al., 2007). All of above indicated that nsp11 from PRRSV may also play an important role in the life cycle of PRRSV. Frieman et al. (2009) and Beura et al. (2010) found that SARS CoV nsp15 and PRRSV nsp11 were the interferon antagonists. Our represent study supplied the first evidence that endoribonuclease was essential for nsp11 as an IFN antagonist and indicated that endoribonuclease of PRRSV nsp11 may play an important role in opposing the defensive system of cell, and this needed further study. Coincidentally, our results were consistent with Yoo et al.\u2019s (2010) and Sun et al.\u2019s (2009) description that PRRSV nsp11 by virtue of its endoribonuclease activity inhibited the induction of IRF-3 and IFN-\u03b2. Our previous study found that PRRSV could weakly trigger the activation of IRF-3 as well as induce the activation of IFN-\u03b2 promoter at 24 h p.i., but their activities were rapidly inhibited in following infection. That is, PRRSV could be sensed by professional beta interferon-producing system in MARC-145 cells and had mechanisms to inhibit this action in MARC-145 cells (Shi et al., 2010). So our present work supplied another evidence that the endoribonuclease of PRRSV nsp11 could antagonize the induction of IFN-\u03b2. Previous studies also showed the intriguing observations that recombinant IFN-\u03b2 not only protected swine alveolar macrophages and MARC-145 cells from infection with PRRSV (Overend et al., 2007), but also could reduce the yield of PRRSV in vivo (Buddaert et al., 1998). All above results indicated that induction of IFN-\u03b2 may be a useful method for control the PRRSV. And this merits the further study.",
