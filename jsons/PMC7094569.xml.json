The lipid bilayer is acquired from host cell membranes during the process of virus assembly and budding. Consequently, infection of host cells requires that enveloped viruses fuse their membrane with cellular membranes to release the nucleocapsid and accessory proteins into the host cell in order to establish a new infectious cycle. Glycoproteins from enveloped viruses evolved to combine two main features. Firstly, they contain a receptor binding function, which attaches the virus to the host cell. Secondly, they include a fusion protein function that can be activated to mediate fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Both tasks can be achieved by a single or by separate glycoproteins acting in concert.",

In the latter case the low pH environment of the endosome leads to protonation of key residues, most probably histidines, which induces conformational changes. These conformational changes result in the exposure of hydrophobic peptides, loops or patches (the so-called \u201cfusion peptides\u201d), which then interact with and destabilize one or both of the participating membranes. Triggering the conformational change in the absence of a target membrane leads to inactivation of the fusion properties of the viral glycoprotein.",

            "text": "The determination of the atomic structure of complete ectodomains or core regions of many viral fusion proteins in their pre- and/or post-fusion states has revealed a large diversity of conformations (see below). Nevertheless, in all the cases studied so far, the structural transition from a pre- to a post-fusion conformation leads to a stable hairpin conformation resulting in the positioning of the two membrane anchors, the transmembrane and the fusion peptide domains, at the same end of a trimeric elongated rod-like structure. Three different classes of viral fusion proteins have been identified to date based on their common post-fusion structural motifs (Table 1\nand Fig. 1\n). These include class I fusion proteins, characterized by trimers of hairpins containing a central \u03b1-helical coiled-coil structure and class II fusion proteins, characterized by trimers of hairpins composed of beta structures [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. A third class of fusion proteins has been described, that also forms trimers of hairpins by combining two structural elements. Similar to class I fusion proteins, the post-fusion trimer displays a central \u03b1-helical trimeric core; however, each fusion domain exposes two fusion loops located at the tip of an elongated \u03b2-sheet revealing a striking convergence with class II fusion proteins [6], [7] (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Although the importance of the hairpin arrangement for membrane fusion was first recognized based on the crystal structure of the post-fusion conformation of HIV-1 gp41 [8], the conclusions drawn were largely based on the known conformational transitions of influenza virus hemagglutinin upon exposure to low pH [1], [9].",

Firstly, activation upon receptor binding or acidification of the endosomal compartment exposes the fusion peptide that is projected toward the top of the glycoprotein, allowing the initial interaction with the target membrane (Fig. 2\nB and C). Secondly, the folding back of the C-terminal region onto a trimeric N-terminal region (Fig. 2D) leads to the formation of a post-fusion protein structure with the outer regions zipped up against the inner trimeric core (Fig. 2E and F). The final step also requires further refolding of the membrane proximal and transmembrane regions in order to obtain a full-length post-fusion structure where both membrane anchors are present in the same membrane [10], [11]. Notably, paramyxoviruses and retroviruses fusion occurs concomitantly with the formation of the post-fusion core structure [12], [13].",

Whether monomerization occurs during class I and class III protein refolding remains a matter of debate. Although the initial steps leading to fusion peptide exposure and its interaction with the target membrane may maintain strict trimeric symmetry, the folding back of the C-terminal part of the molecule requires breaking the three-fold symmetry of the molecule at least for the C-terminal half (Fig. 2C and D). It is also worth to note that the trimer contacts observed in the pre- and post-fusion conformations of both VSV G and paramyxovirus F protein differ [6], [14], [15], [16]. In contrast, the trimer interface is very similar in case of influenza virus HA2 pre- and post-fusion conformations [1].",

According to this view, fusion of two lipid bilayers in an aqueous environment requires that they come into close contact. This process involves local membrane bending creating a first site of contact. Dehydration of the initial contact site induces monolayer rupture that allows mixing of lipids from the two outer leaflets, resulting in a hemifusion stalk, i.e., a local lipidic connection with negative curvature. In a next step, the model predicts that radial expansion of the stalk leads to either direct fusion pore opening or to the formation of another intermediate, the hemifusion diaphragm, a local bilayer resulting from the contact between the two internal leaflets of the fusing membranes. Depending on the experimental system, hemifusion might be restricted (i.e., without lipid exchange between both membranes) or unrestricted (i.e., without any restriction of lipid diffusion). The break of the hemifusion diaphragm also results in pore formation. The initial fusion pore is small and is characterized by an opening and closing (\u201cflickering\u201d). Finally, pore enlargement, which requires most of the energy, leads to complete fusion [17].",

First evidence for a hemifusion intermediate in viral fusion resulted from the replacement of the hemagglutinin membrane anchor by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which revealed the importance of the transmembrane region in the transition from the stalk and/or hemifusion structure to fusion pore opening and expansion (Fig. 2E and D) [18]. Furthermore, hemifusion intermediates, i.e., lipid mixing without content mixing, have been detected in case of HIV-1 env mediated fusion [19], class II protein driven fusion, such as alphavirus E1 [20] and paramyxovirus F fusion [12]. Finally, such hemifusion intermediates were also observed with peptide inhibitors such as HIV-1 gp41 T-20, which target a pre-fusion or pre-hairpin structure [21], [19]. Interestingly, peptide inhibitors derived either from the N-terminal region or from the C-terminal region inhibit either lipid mixing or content mixing, indicating that C-terminal inhibitors allow sufficient membrane bending of the fusion protein to support lipid mixing [12], [19], [22]. Similarly to the N-terminal gp41 peptide, recombinant domain III of alphavirus E1 and flavivirus E inhibit fusion also at the early lipid mixing step [23].",

Furthermore, HA outside the direct contact zone contributes to the fusion activity thus exerting a synergistic effect [43]. Finally, quick freezing electron microscopy images of influenza virus particles fusing with liposomes have revealed local micro contacts between viral and liposomal membranes, resembling stalk intermediates, which are organized in regular polygonal arrangements [44]. In contrast to HA, data on HIV-1 env suggest that a single env glycoprotein trimer is sufficient for fusion [45].

These are indeed also highly similar to SNARE mediated fusion processes, where folding of a four helical bundle leads to the apposition of two membranes and provides the energy for the fusion reaction [49]. However, to understand the fine tuning of fusion further structural studies of complete post-fusion conformations of viral glycoproteins containing both membrane anchors should aid in understanding their precise roles. This might shed light on the open question whether both regions cooperate to regulate the transition from hemifusion to fusion pore opening and/or pore enlargement. In addition, functional studies are needed to test the hypothesis that the membrane anchors are responsible and sufficient to induce curvature. These data could then be used for simulating fusion reactions in silico, which might help to determine the energy requirements and reveal the potential folding path of intermediate states. Finally, understanding the structures of fusion intermediates might be also crucial for the development of fusion inhibitors interfering with virus infection for therapeutic applications.",

(B) A transition in oligomeric state is accompanied by fusion peptide target membrane interaction in case of class II. Intermediate monomeric structures have to be also postulated for Rhabdovirus G and paramyxovirus F. Whether they play a role in other class I mediated fusion reactions (influenza virus HA, HIV-gp41) remains to be determined and if so it might be very short lived. (C) Transient intermediate states where the fusion peptide is anchored in the membrane might induce initial curvature. This might involve several fusion proteins, which might cluster via fusion peptide interactions. (D) Initial refolding of the C-terminal region leads to further apposition of the bilayers. Although this step may keep strict trimeric symmetry at the N-terminus, its C-terminal region must be flexible. (E) Final zipping up of the outer layers might induce hemifusion controlled by both membrane anchors. (F) The membrane anchors also play a critical role in fusion pore opening and possibly expansion.",
