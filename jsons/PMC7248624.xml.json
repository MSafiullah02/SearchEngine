These cases were reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) China office on December 31, 2019. The cause was later identified as a novel Coronavirus, genetically related to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus. This new virus was subsequently named as COVID-19 by WHO on February 11, 2020. On 11 March, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared by WHO as a pandemic after it quickly spread to Iran, Italy and other parts of Europe and North America.",

However, by this point in time, the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 seemed to have lost control in Wuhan. In addition, a large number of people had travelled out of Wuhan to other parts of China amid the massive Chinese New Year migration. To halt the spread of the virus, an emergent city lockdown measure was imposed in Wuhan, the epicentre of COVID-19, on 23 January. The lockdown was later extended to the whole province. The shutdown affected a population of about 60 million, including 11 million in Wuhan. Although this radical move was questioned by many people due to the high economic (and other) costs associated, this approach appeared to be vindicated as the curve for the spread of the disease outside Hubei flattened in mid-February 2020, and the same pattern emerged in Wuhan in late February 2020. On March 14, 2020, only Wuhan was classified as a high-risk area and the rest of the province was medium- or low-risk. In the next few days, the lockdown gradually loosened throughout Hubei Province. On April 8, 2020, the city of Wuhan reopened after more than 10 weeks in lockdown. Air and train services have resumed and the city's recovery is being closely watched by the world.",

Various studies have considered the link between the movement of people and the imported cases of COVID-19. Zhao et al. (2020) found that the number of air passengers from Wuhan and local population can be used to explain the number of cases in the infected cities. Ai et al. (2020) reported a significant and positive relationship between population movement and the number of COVID-19 cases. They argued that some cases could be avoided and prevented if the city closure was implemented earlier. However, most of these studies only consider one transport mode or the total movement of people regardless of the transport means.",

HST, coach (inter-city bus) and air services were the most important means of transporting the five million people out of Wuhan before the lockdown. We believe that exploring the relationship between transport means and the speed and spread pattern of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 is important to both the general public, policy makers and health professionals. Such relationship can also be used for future prediction and control or mitigation when similar incidences take place.",

The presence of an airport or HST station at a city is significantly related to the speed of the pandemic spread, but its link with the number of total confirmed cases is weak. The farther the distance from Wuhan, the lower number of cases in a city and the slower the dissemination of the pandemic. The longitude and latitude values do not have a significant relationship with the number of total cases, but can increase the speed of the COVID-19 spread. Cities in the south were more likely to report the first case earlier than those in the north. The pandemic may emerge in large cities earlier than in small cities.",

It has three railway stations, one international airport, and a significant inland port that lies at the confluence of the Yangtze and Hanjiang rivers. China's first long-haul HST line, the Wuhan-Guangzhou HST, was launched in 2009 (Zhang et al., 2019). This HST line was later extended to Beijing and Hong Kong, forming the longest north-south trunk line of China's \u201c4 + 4\u201d HST network (four north-south and four east-west trunk lines; see, e.g., Wang et al., 2017). Wuhan is also the midpoint of the Shanghai-Wuhan-Chengdu HST line, which is one of the four east-west trunk lines. Therefore, China's most important cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Shenzhen and Hong Kong can be reached within 5 h from Wuhan by HST. Inside Hubei Province, the Wuhan-Shiyan HST commenced services at the end of December 2019, connecting Wuhan to Hubei's key industrial cities such as Xiangyang, and Shiyan. With all these connections, Wuhan has been called the heart of China's HST network and it is ranked the fourth place in China by the weighted degree and closeness centrality, and the second place by weighted betweenness centrality (Jiao et al., 2017). It has been ranked the fourth most important rail-air combined node in China's city network (after Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou; see Zhu et al., 2018), and fourth in terms of the total rail passengers handled and first in terms of the number of transfer passengers in recent years.1\nFurthermore, Wuhan Tianhe International Airport is the largest airport in Central China, ranking the top-15 airports in China by all three centrality indexes (Wang et al., 2011). It handled 27 million passengers in 2019, an increase of 10.8% from 2018. Besides, Wuhan plays an important role in China's intercity coach network (Wang et al., 2020). The weekly frequencies of flights, HST and coaches out of Wuhan are illustrated in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3\n, respectively.",

It has a population of 14 million including 3 million floating population, most of whom are migrant workers from other cities. It also has a large tertiary student population of about 1.3 million. A large outflow of these migrant workers and tertiary students occurred from January 14, 2020 and peaked on January 22, 2020 before the closure of the city. According to The Paper (2020), by 23 January, five million people left Wuhan via different transport methods since January 10, 2020. The top-15 destinations were the cities within Hubei Province, with Huanggang and Xiaogan being the top two. The top-5 provinces were Henan, Hunan, Anhui, Chongqing, and Jiangxi. It is expected that the population that flowed out of Wuhan may have significantly impacted on the outbreaks in other cities. In fact, since the outbreak of COVID-19, tracking passengers from Wuhan and putting them into quarantine were the top priority of almost every city from late January to February 2020, as most of the confirmed cases were imported cases or close contacts of the imported cases.",

The emergence of modern transport modes has accelerated the spread of new diseases in an unprecedented speed and put more people at risk. In this century, human beings have been hit by a series epidemic diseases including SARS, H1N1 pandemic (in 2009), MERS, and most recently, COVID-19 at a global level, owing largely to the growing availability of affordable air travel. The risk of transmission of respiratory infections on airplanes was a major concern to the public and airline industry. Some studies suggested that air transport is a mode that contributes to the accelerating and amplifying influenza propagation, as such transmission can occur in the flight or at the airports (see a comprehensive survey by Browne et al., 2016). However, other studies on the ventilation systems and patient outcomes showed that the dissemination of pathogens during the flight occurs rarely (see a good survey by Leder and Newman, 2005). For example, quite a few studies suggested that in-flight transmission of SARS was not common. Wilder-Smith et al. (2003) reported that in-flight transmission occurred in one of the three flights with SARS patients on board. The authors note that the risk of in-flight transmission is lower than that reported for influenza, but may increase if super-spreaders are on board. However, while the transmission risk in the flight may be low, flights can carry people with the virus to new places. Bowen Jr and Laroe (2006) attempted to examine the link between air transport accessibility and the speed of SARS diffusion. The accessibility to China was measured by flight frequency and directness of scheduled airlines services. They found that airline network accessibility was a determinant of the speed with which SARS arrived in infected countries, but its influence diminished in later weeks of the outbreak due in part to the public health measures such as health screening at the airports.",

Therefore, it is important to exercise good respiratory hygiene and refrain from making unnecessary travels by public transport during the pandemic outbreak season. Cui (20011) confirmed that trains may have played an important role in the 2009 influenza pandemic as a result of the close contact and long exposure in the train cars. Using the laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 for the period from May 2009 to April 2010, Cai (2019) evaluated the effects of airports and railway stations on arrival days and peak days of the virus. The authors found that airports and railways stations in Chinese prefectures significantly advanced the arrival days, but they were not significantly associated with the peak days of the pandemic.",

Our first dependent variable is the cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported on February 15, 2020, most of which were imported cases with a travel history to Wuhan.2\nThis date was chosen because of the following several reasons. First, there was a shortage of testing kits for COVID-19 before mid-February and patients needed to meet strict criteria to become eligible for a test. Second, patients have an incubation period before various symptoms develop. The WHO estimates that the incubation period ranges from 1 to 14 days, with a median of 5\u20136 days.3\nChina reported a case with 24 days of incubation. In addition, the quality of the testing kits from the early days may not have been satisfactory, as they reported a high proportion of false-negative results. The definition of a confirmed case set by China's National Health Commission changed over time. From January to March 2020, seven versions of the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan were issued. The fifth edition even recommended that Hubei Province use CT scan results as confirmation of the infections in order to have a quick identification in the presence of high false-negative risk. Although by 15 February, there had been community-transmission cases, the percentage was relatively low and most of these cases were associated with close contact with those who had travel history to Wuhan. It would not distort the results significantly by including them in the imported cases. As a robustness check, we also use the number of cases on February 1, 2020 as the dependent variable, but it should be noted that the number of cases on this date may not accurately reflect the true cases for the abovementioned reasons.",

The gravity model has also been applied to air transport to identify the determinants of bilateral air passenger or air cargo flows (Zhang and Lu, 2013; Zhang and Zhang, 2016). It has been reported that a large portion of the international trade matrix consists of zero trade, either because data are missing or some economies simply do not trade (Helpman et al., 2008). This is also the case in our study where about one tenth of the cities report zero cases during our study period. The problem of zero or missing trade flows when using gravity models has long been ignored in the international trade literature (Zhang et al., 2018). Many researchers simply discard the zero flows from the sample, which results in the loss of information. Some add a small constant value to the zero values to allow the estimation of log-linear equations (van Bergeijk and Brakman, 2010), but this method does not have a theoretical basis.",

The Levene test is not significant at the 5% level but significant at the 10% level. Therefore, the homogeneity of variance assumption can be assumed at 5%. We find that cities without airports or HST stations recorded an average of 30.7 cases, while those with airports or HST stations reported an average of 87.7. The difference is not statistically significant at a significance level of 5% if equal variances are assumed. Interestingly, if unequal variances are assumed, the difference is statistically significant. This is also the case when the February 1, 2020 data are used. Therefore, it seems that the link between the presence of an airport or HST station and the number of cumulative confirmed cases is not very strong based on the t-test.

However, the presence of an airport or an HST station does not have a significant impact on the number of cases after other variables are controlled for. It is understood that the effect of the HUB dummy can be diluted as it might be correlated with other variables. For example, cities with airport or HST stations tend to be large or at least medium-sized cities, and thus have higher GDP. The correlation matrix of all the independent variables suggest that moderate correlations exist between some variables, but none of them are greater than 0.6. The problem of multicollinearity may arise, but the consequence is not serious particularly because one of the purposes of building the gravity is for future prediction purpose. In fact, multicollinearity does not result in biased estimations.

An increase in HST frequency by one unit is associated with a much smaller increase in the number of cases compared with air travel. Coach services seem not to have any significant links with the imported cases, which is a bit surprising. One possible reason is that the vast majority of coach services are for short trips. Unlike air travel that requires passengers to report to the airport at least 1 h before the departure, and go through several formalities before boarding, Coach passengers normally arrive at the station a short time before the departure and during the trip, they tend to stay in their seats and do not move around as they would do on the HST train.

However, irrespective of the quantile levels, the longitude coordinates are negatively and significantly associated with the arrival days, probably because Wuhan's economic links with cities in the east are closer. For example, Wenzhou, an east coastal city in Zhejiang, reported a large number of imported COVID-19 cases. Wenzhou is famous for its savvy business people scattered across China and the world. About 170,000 business people worked in Wuhan (Ni, 2020), which may have contributed to the quick spread of the COVID-19 virus in Wenzhou when some of them travelled back before the Chinese New Year.

The frequencies of HST and coach services are not statistically significant.

The coefficient of the log-transformed latitude does not vary much and is no different from its OLS estimate for most of the quantiles less than 0.8. The quantile process plot for the log-transformed longitude variable is quite interesting. The coefficient decreases first but starts to increase after the 0.8 quantile. Its coefficient in the lower quantiles (less than 0.5) well exceeds the OLS estimates. In the flight frequency panel, we can see that the coefficient does not differ much from the OLS estimates and is relatively stable across quantiles. The positive effects of the distance become stronger as the quantile increases. In contrast, the negative effect of the transport hub gradually becomes significant and stronger as the quantile rises.",

            "text": "To understand the roles of different transport modes in the spread of COVID-19 pandemic across Chinese cities, we have examined the factors influencing the number of imported cases and the spread speed, and pattern, of the pandemic across Chinese cities. We found that the frequencies of air transport and HST services out of Wuhan are significantly associated with the number of COVID-19 cases in the destination cities, while the frequency of coach services is not quite relevant. The presence of an airport or HST station is significantly related to the spread speed of the pandemic, but its link with the number of confirmed cases is quite week and actually disappears when other factors are controlled for. These results suggest that reducing air frequency from a pandemic centre might be the first measure that can be taken to slow down travel-related imported infections. This was actually the first response of many countries to the COVID-19 outbreak in China. For example, Australia, Singapore and the US closed borders to Chinese nationals and substantially reduced the number flights from China in late January and early February 2020. By doing so, these countries had successfully contained the number of imported COVID-19 cases from China in February 2020. Unfortunately, Australia did not do the same to the US and European countries in a timely manner, which resulted in a rapid increase in the number of imported cases in early March 2020. In late March, China had successfully controlled the spread of COVID-19 pandemic within its border as a result of the strict quarantine measures; however, imported cases from other countries became a major concern. The government therefore decided to limit the number of international flights to China. Chinese airlines were only allowed to operate one route to any specific country with one flight each week. Each foreign airline was only allowed to operate one route to China with one flight per week. With these measures, China has quickly brought the imported cases down to a manageable level.",

            "text": "We also found that the magnitude of the HST frequency coefficient is much smaller than that of the flight frequency in the gravity model. This may have implications to the measures used to contain the pandemic. Many countries have adopted a combination of containment and mitigation measures to delay the surges of patients and flatten the curve to avoid overwhelming the health care system. One extreme measure is to lock down a city and cut off all the transport links with other cities. This normally involves the shutdown and halt of most businesses and outdoor activities, which comes at a huge economic cost. Another extreme is to achieve herd immunity. This option allows the infections to rise in a controlled way until 60% of the population gets infected, after which it would be harder for the virus to spread (Chang, 2020). Between the two methods, a discretionary control policy can be used. For the transport links, these measures can be considered: reduce the air transport frequency without cancelling all the flights; cut air services first while keeping most of the HST services, considering the lesser impact of HST in spreading the disease; tighten the restrictions on residents\u2019 movements when the risk is high and loosen a bit when the pandemic is under control.",

The farther the distance from Wuhan, the lower number of cases in a city and the slower speed for the pandemic to be disseminated. The longitude and latitude coordinates do not have an impact on the number of cases, but are significantly associated with the speed of the COVID-19 spread. Specifically, cities in the east tended to record a COVID-19 case earlier than their west counterparts. Cities in South China may detect the first case earlier than those in North China. The pandemic might spread in large cities first before they arrive to small cities, as GDP is a factor positively associated with the spread speed. All these results suggest that the outbreak of a pandemic in a large city lying in the centre of a country such as Wuhan can have devastating impact on the whole nation and that the extreme measure to lock down the city might have been a correct move to reduce such impact on other parts of China. This is particularly important to Hubei's neighbouring provinces and the well-developed areas in East and South China such as Shanghai, and Guangdong.",
