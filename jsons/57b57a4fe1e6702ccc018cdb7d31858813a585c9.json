Because it is not directly observable, demonstrating evidence of learners' cognitive integration remains a challenge. In addition, little is known about preclinical medical students' approach to diagnostic reasoning despite widespread implementation of clinical reasoning curricula for these early learners. The objectives of this study were to characterize how first-year medical students integrated knowledge to problem-solve during a simulated viral pandemic and to characterize students' diagnostic reasoning approach to this clinical scenario. Materials and Methods Student teams analyzed clinical data to formulate hypotheses for the pandemic's source and submitted reports justifying their hypotheses and treatment recommendations. A content analysis on students' reports identified codes and themes characterizing the learning content integrated and students' approaches to diagnostic reasoning tasks. Results Sixteen problem-solving codes were identified, demonstrating integration of new and previously encountered content from multiple disciplines. A compare-contrast analytical approach was the most commonly employed diagnostic reasoning approach (100%), with a smaller subset of teams also using a causal approach (20%). Discussion Content analysis of preclinical students' diagnostic justification tasks provided insights into their approach to diagnostic reasoning, which was most consistent with the search-inference framework rather than a causal approach, likely due to limited pathophysiological knowledge at that point in training. Conclusions Evidence of cognitive integration can be made explicit through learners' narrative justification of diagnostic reasoning tasks. Preclinical students' diagnostic reasoning development has implications for curricular design and implementation for this learner group.",

Previous studies have suggested that novices primarily utilize a pathophysiologic analytical (i.e., causal) approach to diagnostic reasoning and rely less on the compare-contrast analytical approach or on pattern recognition, both of which are thought to develop only after trainees begin building robust illness scripts based on clinical experience [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . However, the novices in published studies examining diagnostic reasoning approaches have been limited to intermediate (third year or fourth year) medical students, resident physicians, or nonmedical health professions students (e.g., massage therapy students, undergraduate kinesiology students, physical therapy students) [5, 8, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] ; little is known about the diagnostic reasoning approaches of early, preclinical medical students. Published studies involving preclinical medical students consist of intervention studies reporting results of knowledge-based testing or diagnostic accuracy rather than characterization of how these students formulate their differential or working diagnoses [9, [21] [22] [23] [24] . Since clinical reasoning curricula now extend into the preclinical years for many medical schools, understanding these learners' approach to diagnostic reasoning from the beginning of their development is important for both curriculum development and learner assessment in these cognitive skills.",

In addition, previous studies on diagnostic reasoning among medical students indicate these novice learners tend to utilize a causal approach [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . However, in our study, only a small proportion of student reports alluded to using a causal approach. These contrasting findings are likely in part due to the fact that most prior studies were conducted on students at more advanced stages of training than that of our learner group. The use of a compare-contrast approach we observed among students' reports following the pandemic simulation is likely explained by the fact that their biomedical knowledge base was not yet sufficient at that point in their training to allow them to analyze the clinical data of the pandemic case with a causal approach. Indeed, these students had not yet been exposed to much of the pathophysiology implicated by the signs and symptoms of the patients in the simulated case scenario (excessive bleeding and aggression). Our findings may be explained by the search-inference framework proposed by Aberegg et al., which is not unlike what patients often do to investigate their own symptoms [30] . In this framework, novice problemsolvers-motivated by a specific goal-develop a list of possibilities by seeking their memory or external sources and then use inference to compare and evaluate these possibilities by seeking evidence for and against each one, again using their memory or external sources. The problem-solver then selects the solution mostly likely to satisfy the goal, based on his/her evaluation of the evidence. However, as Aberegg and colleagues point out, such an approach-though practical for the novice-is susceptible to many types of cognitive biases that, left unchecked, could easily lead the clinician astray.",

In fact, understanding and connecting the underlying causal mechanisms to their corresponding clinical manifestations of disease has been shown to be beneficial to the diagnostic reasoning performance of novice learners, with improved long-term memory retention of diagnostic categories and superior diagnostic accuracy when solving difficult cases [5] [6] [7] . As novices' biomedical knowledge base continues to expand during their preclinical training, practicing diagnostic reasoning through challenging cases, such as the one presented in our simulated pandemic activity, has benefits for further developing their mental representations of disease. Chamberland and colleagues found that challenging cases appear to activate medical students' biomedical knowledge by stimulating pathophysiological inferences during self-explanation [18] . Other studies have demonstrated the benefit of self-explanation during diagnostic reasoning, resulting in improved diagnostic accuracy of complex cases, even without receiving feedback on one's clinical reasoning [17, [31] [32] [33] . Self-explanation is thought to improve learners' understanding of the learning material by activating cognitive processes that ultimately strengthen the cognitive connections between elements of the information learned [32] .",

Despite the fact that justification prompts were included in the report template and student instruction documents for the simulated pandemic activity, our students' written diagnostic justifications did not include much discussion of pathophysiological mechanisms. Again, this discrepancy may be due to our more novice learner group and their limited biomedical knowledge at the time of the simulation.",

Graber and colleagues found that third-year medical students use electronic resources extensively during problemsolving, particularly Google's search engine; online journal articles and other clinical decision tools such as UpToDate\u00ae were used much less frequently. Focus group findings from their study suggested potential reasons for these source usage patterns related to students' familiarity with Google and their inability to assess the relative efficacy of online decision-support resources [36] . More recent studies have shown similar findings, with Google, Wikipedia, and social media being the information-seeking resources most frequently used by contemporary medical students, whereas online journals, scholarly databases, and medical texts are accessed relatively infrequently [37] [38] [39] . Features such as ease of use and efficiency of access appear to heavily influence today's medical students' choices of such resources [39] [40] [41] .",

Student team reports were submitted as a group and therefore may not fully reflect every individual student member's diagnostic justification performance. The 4-hour time limitation for the simulated pandemic activity may have affected students' performance of the assigned tasks, particularly with respect to their selected information-seeking behaviors. In addition, students' actual diagnostic reasoning approaches while working in their small groups may have included other strategies beyond those documented in their reports; their use of causal inferences, for example, could have been more prevalent than what was reflected in their written reports. Similarly, students' information sources during self-directed learning may have included other sources beyond those cited in their reports. This study provides insight into early medical students' diagnostic reasoning approach and information-seeking behaviors during self-directed learning tasks. Future study is needed to determine if the same behaviors we observed in this study would occur in this learner group when presented with other clinical problem-solving scenarios. Such data would add further support to the search-inference framework hypothesis and could have important implications for clinical reasoning curricula for learners at this stage in medical school training.",

Evidence of learners' cognitive integration can be made explicit through their narrative justification of problem-solving tasks. Patterns of learners' task performance can provide important insights into their problem-solving, clinical reasoning, and self-directed learning approaches. Our study suggests that early medical students tend to rely on a compare-contrast approach to diagnostic reasoning similar to the search-inference framework described by previous authors. Students' sources of information for self-directed learning were consistent with findings of other studies of this generation of digital native learners. These findings could have implications for clinical reasoning curricular design for these early learners.",
