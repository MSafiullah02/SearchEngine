Balancing the risks of infection from immunosuppression with the consequences of increased myositis disease activity continues to challenge physicians. In recent years, studies continue to identify infection as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with IIM [1\u20134]. Our aim in this report is to provide an updated review of literature as it pertains to infections in IIM, with particular focus on Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP).",

The most common infection site was the lung, with pneumonia accounting for over 85% of infections. Causative organisms were identified in 43 patients, the majority of which were opportunistic infections, the three most common being pulmonary aspergillosis, PJP, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia [2]. Of note, 40% of the patients studied received IV pulse solumedrol in the month prior to admission, and 86% were on at least 0.5 mg/kg of daily prednisone.",

In the same French study of 279 IIM patients, the authors examined which medications patients were taking at the time their infection was diagnosed. Comparing patients who developed an infection (N = 94) to those who did not (N = 185), they reported that methotrexate and IVIG were both statistically associated with infection, OR 2.12 (95% CI 1.22\u20133.68) and OR 3.58 (95% CI 2.06\u20136.25), respectively. Upon adjusting for other factors in multivariable regression (malignancy, myalgia, ventilator insufficiency, and esophageal involvement), only methotrexate was statistically associated with infection (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1\u20133.66, p = 0.02) [5]. Different results were obtained from Prior and colleagues, who reported in a time-to-event analysis that plasmapheresis (PLEX), mycophenolate, and corticosteroids were all statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of infection. The multivariable HRs after adjusting for disease, sex, age, and drug exposure were 1.31 (95% CI 1.17\u20131.47, p < 0.0001) for corticosteroids, 1.77 (95% CI 1.33\u20132.34, p < 0.0001) for PLEX, and 1.38 (95% CI 1.07\u20131.77, p = 0.012) for mycophenolate.",

For one, there appears to be consensus that infection remains a main driver of morbidity and mortality in IIM patients. The lung is the most common site of infection, and opportunistic infections are not infrequent. Given the heterogeneity of opportunistic infections reported, it would be prudent to cast a wide diagnostic net when evaluating a patient with IIM where infection is suspected, including viral PCR and fungal staining on biospecimens. It remains unclear which disease characteristics and specific immunosuppressants place a patient at highest risk. Given the lung is a common site of infection, factors such as interstitial lung disease and dysphagia seem likely to confer risk. Similarly, while prednisone use appears to be a risk factor for many infections, the risk of other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs and biologics is less clear.",

Despite these mortality rates, many rheumatologists and other healthcare providers do not routinely administer prophylaxis [10, 11]. This is at least in part due to the lack of evidence-based guidelines to help clinicians appropriately provide prophylaxis.",

Some studies advocated for considering other risk factors such as intrinsic lung disease and older age. The authors went on to perform a small case-control study of 11 patients with autoimmune disease who developed PJP (two of which had inflammatory myositis). Upon adjusting for corticosteroid use, they showed that lymphopenia remained a statistically significant independent risk factor (p = 0.02), suggesting this may be a risk factor regardless of whether the patient is on corticosteroids.",

The authors calculated an adverse event incidence rate of 2.2% per person-year (among 124 patients who received prophylaxis, 12 had an adverse event during the study period). Since this ascertainment was based on reported allergies in the electronic medical record for the adverse event rate, this is likely an underestimate [11].",

Of these treatment episodes, 262 were associated with TMP/SMX prophylaxis. Propensity score matching was utilized to account for differences between the two populations (group receiving prophylaxis versus group who did not). Expectedly, patients who received prophylaxis were more likely to be older, have lymphopenia, have a \u201chigh risk\u201d rheumatic disease (granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, DM), and to be treated with secondary immunosuppressive agents.

Along with other recommendations [15], including those suggested by Winthrop and Baddley, patients who receive steroids for \u2265 4 weeks should be given PJP prophylaxis [16\u2022\u2022]. However, reports exist of PJP occurring in patients < 4 weeks after prednisone monotherapy [17]. Until prospective, controlled studies are performed investigating different PJP prophylaxis strategies, it is unlikely we will have adequate evidence to make confident recommendations. Additional data will be needed to understand the adverse event rate of PJP prophylaxis agents as was done by Schmajuk and Park et al. Only then will risk/benefit ratios be able to be calculated and an informed discussion with patients can be conducted. In our practice, patients with IIM are typically prescribed TMP/SMX for PJP prophylaxis with prolonged (> 2 weeks) prednisone use over 20 mg/day. The discontinuation of TMP/SMX occurs when prednisone is less than 20 mg and/or lymphopenia improves. We typically prescribe trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole DS three times per week or dapsone 100 mg daily, the latter only after ensuring normal G6PD enzyme activity.",

Importantly, a single case has been reported of a patient with untreated DM developing PML, suggesting immunosuppression may not always be required for PML to occur [22]. While IVIG is often considered \u201cprotective\u201d for infectious complications due to passive immunity, at least 3 PML cases have been reported in IIM patients receiving IVIG in addition to other immunosuppressants [21]. While patients should be counseled on this potential and rare risk of medications, often it is judged that the potential benefits outweigh the risks.",

The adjusted hazards ratio for developing VZV in IIM patients compared with matched controls was 3.90 (95% CI 3.18\u20134.77). The incidence rate for VZV per 1000 person-years was higher in IIM patients even if they were not on immunosuppressive therapy (28.7/1000 person-years) compared with matched controls (5.75/1000 person-years).

In 2006, the live attenuated shingles vaccine Zostavax\u00ae emerged to help prevent shingles and its complications. More recently, in 2017, a new dead virus vaccine called Shingrix\u00ae was released that is more than 90% effective in preventing shingles and PNH, and is the preferred vaccine recommended by the Centers for Disease Control [23]. Adults over 50 are approved for the vaccine, and it is given in a two shot series, administered 2\u20136 months apart. Even if patients have had the original shingles vaccine (Zostavax\u00ae) or shingles itself, they can still receive Shingrix\u00ae. Unlike Zostavax, which is a weakened live virus, Shingrix uses a dead virus, so in theory, the use in immunosuppressed patients is safe.",
