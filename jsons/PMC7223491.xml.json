            "text": "Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is one of the major causes of neonatal respiratory morbidity and mortality.1 Although the early use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) significantly reduced the need for surfactant replacement therapy in RDS, still over half of all preterm neonates with RDS require surfactant.2 Historically, surfactant was administered via an endotracheal tube during a period of mechanical ventilation. As mechanical ventilation may cause ventilator-induced lung injury and increases the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD),3 the technique of less invasive surfactant administration (LISA) was developed. In this technique surfactant is administered via a thin catheter in spontaneously breathing infants on nasal CPAP.4 A systematic review including six randomized controlled trials with a total of 895 infants showed a significantly reduced incidence of BPD and death and a lesser need of mechanical ventilation in infants treated with LISA compared with infants treated with surfactant via an endotracheal tube during mechanical ventilation.5",

LISA is performed in infants with a gestational age less than 32 weeks with clinical signs of RDS, respiratory support with nasal CPAP with a positive end-expiratory pressure of at least 6 cm H2O, and an oxygen requirement of 30% or more to maintain SpO2 levels between 88 and 95%.",

A dose of atropine 10 \u03bcg/kg was administered 5 to 10 min before start of the procedure to prevent reflex bradycardia during laryngoscopy and catheter placement. About 1 to 2 minutes before start of the procedure, sucrose 20% (0.1 ml/kg) was administered in the cheek pouch and facilitated tucking was applied. During the procedure, swaddling was performed to contain the infant and promote comfort. Sedative premedication was not used. A laryngoscope was then used for visualization of the vocal cords and placement of the catheter. At the start of the study we used a 5F umbilical catheter which was placed between the vocal cords with the use of a Magyll forceps. During the study we started to use a shorter and stiffer LISA catheter (Chiesi Pharmaceuticals, Parma, Italy), for which the use of a Magyll forceps was no longer needed. After placement of either catheter, surfactant (Curosurf, 150\u2013200 mg/kg) was instilled over a period of 1\u20133 min while the patient was spontaneously breathing on nasal CPAP. During surfactant instillation, aspiration was done via the nasogastric tube to check for surfactant spill. After surfactant instillation was complete, the catheter was immediately removed.",

In one retrospective study and one randomized controlled trial, propofol as premedication for LISA has shown to increase the need for noninvasive intermittent positive pressure ventilation.25,26 Although the need for endotracheal intubation was not increased in patients treated with propofol, the frequency of mechanical ventilation in the first 72 h of life was higher compared with those that did not receive premedication.20 Ketamine as premedication led to a relatively high need for endotracheal intubation.27 Since LISA failure causes a higher median number of days on mechanical ventilation, a higher incidence of supplemental oxygen at day 28 and a 20% lower survival without serious adverse events,31 it is important to use sedative premedication that has little to no effect on the respiratory drive in order to prevent LISA failure.",

Besides this, during LISA oxygen desaturations are not only an effect of laryngoscopy but are also caused by the administration of surfactant. The increase in heart rate found in our study is at least partly due to the administration of atropine prior to LISA and is therefore no clear indicator of patient stress and discomfort.

One of the goals of our study was to determine the effects of awake LISA on vital parameters. We found a significant increase in heart rate at all time points after start op LISA, but this is most probably due to the administration of atropine, rather than a reflection of patient stress and discomfort. Nevertheless, we encourage the use of atropine prior to LISA, since it prevents the occurrence of bradycardia and its related risk for hypoxia.",

Patients with available data had significantly higher gestational and postnatal ages compared with patients in whom vital parameter data were not available. Since we found no influence of gestational and postnatal age on the success rate and technical quality, we would not expect the effects of awake LISA on vital parameters to be different in younger compared with older infants. The availability of vital parameter data in only a small proportion of patients, therefore, will most likely not have affected the validity of our findings. Other limitations are the lack of blood pressure data, which could have helped make a distinction between atropine effect and stress in patients with a significant elevation of heart rate, and the lack of objective measurements of pain and discomfort.",

Although providing patient comfort should be a key factor in neonatology, the adverse effects of performing LISA without premedication should be carefully weighed against the negative effects and risks of administering sedative premedication before LISA. Other forms of premedication with lesser effect on the respiratory drive need to be investigated. The use of atropine during LISA resulted in a very low incidence of bradycardia and should therefore be strongly considered, regardless of the use of sedative premedication.",
