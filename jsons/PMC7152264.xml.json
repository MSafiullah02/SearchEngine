Responses to larger disasters need support from adjacent counties, the state, and sometimes from the federal level. The Hospital Emergency Incident Command System (HEICS)2 provides a leadership framework within and among organizations responding to an emergency. HEICS emphasizes flexibility for any type of event, scalability to the size of the event, clear lines of authority, and consistent communications. Disaster plans at every hospital incorporate HEICS principles.",

For a sudden-impact event involving modest (10% to 15%) increases above usual peak hospital capacity at one or more local hospitals, ordinary surge methods would suffice to provide normal standards of critical care to all those who need it. Ordinary critical care surge needs are met by canceling elective admissions, quickly discharging all patients who can safely leave the ICU, mobilizing staff, and adding beds, as feasible. Most hospitals have occasional experience with ordinary critical care surge responses.",

In these circumstances, population-based goals would attempt to maximize numbers of survivors by providing immediate lifesaving interventions to all persons who need them and delaying or forgoing other interventions. Thus standards of mass critical care are not equivalent to normal circumstances and should be considered to be crisis standards of care. Sudden impact events that stress the resources of a community may require the implementation of temporary reactive mass critical care. Experience with a massive surge of critically injured patients after a major fire demonstrated the satisfactory outcomes that are possible as a result of well-organized responses that included elements of the temporary reactive mass critical care approach.6 A sustained PHE that exceeds resources over a wide area may require the sustained implementation of mass critical care.

When a single-patient room is not available, more than 3 feet separation between beds reduces sharing of items between patients. Staff should wear a gown and gloves for contact with the patient or contaminated objects.3.Droplet precautions prevent transmission of pathogens spread through close respiratory contact. Because these pathogens do not remain infectious over long distances, special air handling is not required. When a single-patient room is not available, more than 3 feet separation with a curtain between beds reduces droplet transmission. Staff should wear a mask for close contact with the patient.4.Airborne precautions prevent transmission of infections transmissible over long distances when suspended in the air. A negative pressure isolation room reduces airborne transmission. Staff should wear a mask or fit-tested N-95 respirator, depending on disease-specific recommendations. Infection control practices for specific clinical syndromes are detailed in standard references24 and later in this chapter.\n",

However, manual ventilation has been used successfully via tracheostomy tubes for days in a polio epidemic,26 temporarily for hours via endotracheal tubes in a power failure,27 and during weather emergencies.28., 29., 30. In the patient transport setting, manual ventilation provides similar gas exchange compared with mechanical ventilation.31., 32., 33. Work to manually deliver small tidal volumes to an infant is less than that needed for an adult. Infection risks are negligible except for specific transmissible infections. Self-inflating bags can be used with ambient air or low-flow oxygen. When temporary manual ventilation is provided until mechanical ventilators are available, outcomes are likely to be superior to the outcomes in cases of untreated respiratory failure. Just-in-time training and supervision of supplemental providers may improve their performance in providing appropriate gas exchange and avoiding barotrauma.",
