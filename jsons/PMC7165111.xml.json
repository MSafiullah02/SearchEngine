Its genome has ranged from 26 to 32 kb in length, and currently can be divided into 4 genera named Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta coronavirus [3]. Considering the frequent mutation and recombination of coronavirus, novel coronavirus variants continues to appear, so far it has caused several serious public health safety incidents [4,5]. In 2003 and 2012, two types of animal coronavirus transmitted into human population caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), respectively [6,7]. Since then, researches on coronavirus has greatly increased. Recently, a coronavirus called Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been discovered in Wuhan, China, which caused viral pneumonia and hyperpyrexia of patients [8]. In addition, there is evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from person to person [9], and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may originated from Chinese horseshoe bats [10].",

But in the case of co-infection with other pathogens such as canine adenovirus (CAV) or canine parvovirus (CPV), CCoV infection can cause severe clinical signs and even fatal cases [15,16]. Furthermore, fatal cases also be discovered in the cases without co-infection, which subsequently be identified causing by high virulent strains named pantropic CoVs [[17], [18], [19]]. CCoV belongs to species Alphacoronavirus 1, genus Alphacoronavirus, which is same to feline coronavirus (FCoV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV) [3]. In 2003, canine coronavirus was newly recognized as respiratory tract virus [20]. Unlike canine enteric coronavirus (CCoV), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) belongs to Beta coronavirus [20,21]. To data, CCoVs contains 2 distinct genotypes, which named CCoV\u2013I and CCoV-II [22]. CCoV-II can be further divided into CCoV-IIa and CCoV-IIb [23,24]. However, novel CCoV variants, such as A76, which not included in the two known genotypes has been discovered. Hence, CCoV-IIc has ever been proposed [25], but considering the limited sequences identified, this clade has not been publicly accepted yet.",

Here, the positive rates of CCoV is 23.94% (51/213) in pet dogs with apparent diarrhea symptoms, which is nearly with the mentioned above in China, but obvious lower than previous reported in Japan and Greece [36] (50.5% and 65.1% in dogs with diarrhea, respectively) but higher than in Brail(12% in dogs with diarrhea) [35]. In addition, CCoV co-infected with other enteric viruses such as CPV, CaKV and CBoV were frequent reported in diarrheic dogs [33,37,42,43]. Here, 70.59% CCoV-positive samples were co-infected with one or more CPV, CaAstV, CaKV, TTCaV strains. In China, the effective vaccines are available for most pet dogs, but CCoV still existed as one of the most common agents for viral enteritis [44]. It is worth mentioning that among the positive samples of CCoV, 27.45% pet dogs were well vaccinated, which may indicate the incomplete protection of current vaccines. Considering most of vaccines were designed based on the classical CCoV-IIa strains, it was likely not to effective against CCoV\u2013I, then many AA changes existed in current circulating CCoV-IIa in comparison with the classical CCoV-IIa strains, whether the vaccine is effective is uncertain [25].",

In our study, apart from the single infection with CCoV\u2013I, CCoV-IIa and CCoV-IIb, two or three genotypes multiple infections accounts for 29.41% (15/51), which indicates co-infection of different CCoV subtypes were widely existed. Previously studies have reported that CCoV-II, especially CCoV-IIa is the main subtypes circulating in Heilongjiang of China during 2014\u20132015, and CCoV-IIb is the major subtypes circulating in Vietnam [39]. Here, of the CCoV positive dogs, 42 (82.35%) dogs were positive for CCoV-IIa, which is obvious higher than CCoV\u2013I (29.41%) and CCoV-IIb (23.53%). These results revealed that CCoV-IIa play a more dominated role among pet dogs in China.",

However, in this study, we discovered that CCoV-II can be divided into 3 distinct subtypes CCoV-IIa, CCoV-IIb and CCoV-II Variant, which is differ from the 2 subtypes CCoV-IIa and CCoV-IIb as mentioned before. In addition, phylogenetic analysis results also revealed that CCoV-IIa is the predominate genotype currently circulating in China. The strain B906_ZJ_2019 was clustered into CCoV-II variant with strain A76, which was identified a novel NTD with other CCoV-II strains and may as a result of recombination of CCoV\u2013I and CCoV-II [34]. Recombination plays a vital role in genetic evolution of coronavirus, and have high potential for the emergence of novel variants [46]. CCoV-IIb was suggested as a novel recombinant variant, which show close relationship with TGEV [[22], [23], [24],32,47]. Strain B906_ZJ_2019 showed 93.24% nucleotide similarity to A76. The entire spike gene of CoV can cleave into S1 and S2 subunit, and S1 subunit including N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-domain [25,48]. Recombination results showed that the NTD and S2 region of B906_ZJ_2019 closely related to CCoV\u2013I and CCoV-II, respectively. These results may suggest that B906_ZJ_2019 is a recombinant variant between CCoV\u2013I and CCoV-II. In addition, the C-domain of B906_ZJ_2019 still not well clustered into CCoV\u2013I and CCoV-II, but formed a single clade with A76, which may suggest a second recombination, but this still needs further investigation. Previously study suggested that the distinct C-domain caused a distinct host tropism which differ from the classic CCoV strain CCoV 1\u201371 (accession number: JQ404409). The host tropism of B906_ZJ_2019 still needs further study. Considering the exist of strain A76, this recombination may occur more frequent than we expected. Furthermore, different subtypes CCoV co-infection may support this recombination.",

            "text": "As a typical RNA virus with the largest genome, CoV also presents high level of occurring of mutations [1]. We found 37 AA changes in S1 domain and 8 in S2 domain among CCoV-IIa strains identified here and the classical CCoV-IIa strains. The spike protein is the major antigenicity determinant and also play a vital role in receptor binding and viral entry [49]. During virus entry, S1 subunit is the major region that binds to host cell surface receptors, while S2 is associated with membrane fusion [50]. Whether these AA changes are related to the receptor binding, immunity escaping or other functions still unknown. Therefore, further investigations still need to clarify the specific functions of these non-synonymous substitutions. Cross-host transmission frequently occurred in animal virus, such as porcine circovirus (PCV3) [51], and pseudorabies virus (PRV) [52] in DNA virus, influenza A viruses (IAVs) [[53], [54], [55]] and coronavirus [7,[56], [57], [58]] in RNA virus. One of the most notable is coronavirus. Recently, a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 emerged in worldwide and was suggested to originate from bats [10]. From SARS to COVID-19, coronaviruses pose a significant threat to public health and cause serious economic loss. Although there is currently no evidence that coronavirus can cross species barrier from dogs to human, it is necessary to monitor the evolution process of canine coronavirus.",
