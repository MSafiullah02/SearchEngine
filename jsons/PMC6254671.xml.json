            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a respiratory disease caused by Middle East\nrespiratory syndrome coro-navirus (MERS-CoV). MERS involves high fever, cough, difficulty in\nbreathing, chills, chest pain, body aches, sore throat, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, running\nnose, renal failure, and pneumonia. The first case of MERS in humans was reported in Saudi\nArabia in 2012. After 2012, within a span of only 4 years, MERS-CoV infection was reported\nfrom 27 countries.1 Three MERS outbreaks\nhave already occurred in Saudi Arabia (2013 and 2014) and South Korea (2015).2\u20134 The outbreak reported in South Korea also involved spread of\nMERS through hospital-to-hospital transit of patients and had the fatality rate as high as\n40%. High attack rate and easy spread of MERS indicate an epidemic risk.5\u20137 To date, no specific vaccine is available for MERS. The\nsteep increase in MERS cases and its high mortality rate demand an urgent need for specific\nand safe MERS vaccine. Thus far, only little information is known about the pathogenesis of\nMERS-CoV. Hence, an immunoinformatics approach to thoroughly study and screen immunogenic\nproteins from the available proteome sequence data of MERS-CoV is essential for vaccine\ndesign.",

These proteins are involved in infection and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV to human\nhost cells. Spike (S) glycoprotein, in particular, its receptor-binding domain, is involved\nin virus and host cell interaction.8\nEnvelope (E) protein plays an important role in host cell recognition.9 Nucleocapsid (N) protein is involved in RNA binding during\nribonucleocapsid formation by MERS-CoV.10\nMembrane (M) protein has interferon (IFN)-antagonizing properties, thus reducing IFN levels\nin infected patients.11 Open reading\nframe (ORF) proteins also play critical roles in viral infection and pathogenesis. A\nmutation study of ORFs (ORF3, ORF4a, ORF4b, and ORF5) indicated that ORFs have major\nimplications in viral infection involving disruption of host cell processes, dysregulated\nIFN pathway activation, and abrupt inflammation.12 Proteins ORF1a (4P16) and ORF1ab (4WUR) are papain-like proteases (PL(pro))\ninvolved in viral infection and are potential targets for the development of antiviral\ndrugs.13 PL(pro) facilitate infection\nby their proteolytic, deubiquitinating, and deISGylating activities suppressing innate\nimmune response from the host cell. Protein ORF1a (4RSP), a protease (3CLpro), facilitates\nproteolytic activity during viral infection and replication.14,15\nProtein ORF1ab (5WWP) is a helicase protein of MERS-CoV, and it is one of the most conserved\nproteins among nidoviruses. Protein ORF8b is a highly conserved protein, and during\ninfection, it induces various immune responses.16",
