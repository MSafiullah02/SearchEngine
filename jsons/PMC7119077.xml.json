            "text": "The biology of pro-protein convertases (PCs) is fundamental to the cell infrastructure and to the proper coordination of the entire mammalian physiology. Through their endoproteolytic actions on inactive precursor proteins in the secretory pathway, PCs generate essential bioactive peptides, including hormones and neuropeptides (e.g. adrenocorticotropic hormone and insulin), that have vital roles in homeostatic balance and the regulation of life functions. They also activate growth factors and differentiation factors, proteins in the extracellular matrix and plasma, enzymes, receptors, viral-coat proteins and bacterial toxins. The PC family of enzymes is encoded by seven genes (see Box 1\nand Table 1\nfor nomenclature), of which the archetype furin is the most studied (reviewed in 1, 2). Mammalian PCs are related to the yeast kexin and bacterial subtilisins, and Figure 1\npresents the structural features of PCs. PCs are Ca2+-dependent serine proteases that were identified originally based on their ability to cleave precursor proteins at the peptide bond C-terminal to paired basic residues, such as K-R\u2193 and R-R\u2193. However, the cleavage-recognition motifs are now known to extend N-terminal to the cleavage site and often include additional arginine residues (e.g. R-x-[K/R]-R\u2193).Box 1The newly adopted PC nomenclatureThe seven members of the PC family are classified as MEROPS clan SB family S8 (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk). They are related to the bacterial family of degradative subtilisins (IUBMB EC 3.4.21.62) and, to some extent, are structurally and functionally analogous to the yeast kexin (EC 3.4.21.61). The family of PCs has several confusing nomenclatures. A consensus nomenclature was agreed at the Gordon Research Conference: Pro-protein Processing, Trafficking and Secretion (2004) and the officially adopted nomenclature of the pro-protein convertases is now furin (EC 3.4.21.75), PC2 (EC 3.4.21.93), PC1/3 (EC 3.4.21.94), PACE4, PC4, PC5/6 and PC7. The corresponding genes that encode these PCs are designated officially as PCSK type 1\u2013PCSK type 7. Table 1 presents the names attributed to each PC and the corresponding official nomenclature.",

Although increasing evidence of similarity between the various PCs raises the issue of whether specific compounds that target individual PCs can be developed, five major approaches that are described in this article appear to make this possible.",

            "text": "There is increasing interest in PCs as novel targets for drug design because they are proteolytically selective enzymes, the tissue and cellular localization patterns of which have been studied extensively [3]. In addition, they have well-defined cellular tasks and are crucial for the initiation and progress of many important diseases, most prominently in several viral infections and cancers. For example, furin and PC7 are required for the activation of HIV-1 viral coat protein glycoprotein 160 (gp160) to gp120 and gp41 to produce virions that are effective in receptor binding and membrane fusion during infection [4]. A similar PC-mediated processing requirement for viral spread and cytopathicity also occurs with the Epstein-Barr virus gB glycoprotein [5], the hepatitis B virus e antigen [6] and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike glycoprotein [7]. These roles make drugs that target PCs potential antiviral agents. In the area of cancer, ongoing work is clarifying the pivotal role of PCs in growth regulation and tumor progression by activating cancer-promoting factors such as stromelysin-3 [8], vascular endothelial growth factor c (VEGF-C) [9], insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGFr1) 10, 11, transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) [12] and membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-1) [13]. In addition, PC-inhibition studies are beginning to provide direct evidence of their roles in tumorigenesis and invasiveness 13, 14, 15.",

However, the most potent inhibitors known to date, which target the catalytic site, are not significantly specific for a single PC. Comparing inhibitors of PCs shows that many have high potency but are not specific for one PC (Figure 2\n). In addition, PCs are often coexpressed within cells, so that all cells express a \u2018cocktail\u2019 of at least two PCs.

This has been emphasized recently by studies in transgenic inducible-knockout mice, which lack furin in the liver [24]. Known substrates of furin in the liver (e.g. albumin, \u03b15 integrin, lipoprotein-receptor-related protein, vitronectin, \u03b11-microglobulin and bikunin) are either processed or partially processed in these mice, which indicates redundancy with other PCs in the liver.

The crystal structure of furin provides crucial information on the spatial arrangement of the two domains that are implicated in PC activity: the catalytic domain, which contains the active site that is responsible for substrate-specific recognition and processing; and the P domain, which is responsible for enzyme stability (Figure 3\na). The crystal structure of furin in a covalently bound complex with the suicide inhibitor decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone (dec-RVKR-cmk) [25] has led to the identification of the reactive amino acids that make up the S1\u2013S4 subsite pockets*\n. This structural information permits modeling and docking analysis 27, 28, which has led to the extrapolation of further subsites, including the S5, S6 and S1\u2032 subsite pockets (Figure 3b, Table 2\n). Apart from S3 and S1\u2032, all subsite pockets of the active site of furin contain several protophilic carboxylates and carboxamides, which explains the stringent preference for either arginyl or lysyl functionality groups in substrates and inhibitors (Table 2).",

Fug\u00e8re et al., unpublished), which highlights the difficulty in achieving substantial specificity using the active site exclusively. From a therapeutic perspective, d-polyarginines are interesting as lead compounds because they cannot be cleaved by PCs and are thus more stable. d-Peptide therapeutics are also less prone to other proteolytic activities such as carboxypeptidases. d-hexa-arginine blocks the activation of P. aeruginosa exotoxin A [16] and d-nona-arginine partially protects macrophages and mice against anthrax toxemia 17, 27. l-Hexa-arginine is an efficient inhibitor of the processing of gp160 (env) at the REKR551 sequence in vitro and ex vivo, and effectively suppresses HIV-1 infection of T cells and macrophages [4]. Both furin and PC7, the two principal PCs that are expressed by HIV-host cells, are the best candidates for processing the precursor of HIV-1 gp160 [37]. If polyarginine peptides do not exhibit undesirable interactions with other biological processes they might become key components for a combined therapy that targets furin, PC5/6 and PC7 simultaneously.

The first successful example is \u03b11-antitrypsin, which has been transformed into a potent furin inhibitor by the insertion of a furin-like recognition sequence (Arg355-Ile-Pro-Arg358) into its reactive-site loop. This bioengineered protein, named antitrypsin-portland (\u03b11-AT-PDX), inhibits furin and PC5/6 without altering its serpin-like mechanism of inhibition (reviewed in [32]). The potential therapeutic value of \u03b11-AT-PDX is demonstrated by its ability, following exogenous application, to prevent processing of HIV type 1 gp160 and maturation ex vivo of pro-gB, the precursor of human cytomegalovirus envelope glycoprotein of \u03b2-herpesviridae. More recently, \u03b11-AT-PDX has been tested in cancer-related applications. Whereas overexpression of furin and other PCs is associated with a significant increase in metastatic spreading potential and tumor-cell proliferation 8, 38, \u03b11-AT-PDX decreases the invasiveness of head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma by 50% in vitro, and by up to 80% when inoculated in tracheal xenotransplants [15]. Expression of \u03b11-AT-PDX from a DNA vector in transfectant tumor xenotransplants of astrocytoma cells also suppresses efficiently tumorigenicity and invasiveness [13]. Although \u03b11-AT-PDX represents a strong case for targeting PCs in pathophysiological processes, the large size of this protein (45 kDa) limits its practical application. Nonetheless, \u03b11-AT-PDX might be used effectively to block processing events that occur at the outer surface of the cell membrane.",

Then, randomization of strategic eglin c residues that make contact with PC residues outside the catalytic cleft, namely \u2018adventitious contacts\u2019, proved extremely efficient in designing two variants of eglin c that target either furin or PC7 with significant specificity [29]. These two variants, Val33-Arg42-Arg45-Asp49-eglin c (K\ni=270 pM for furin and 11 nM for PC7) and Arg42-Arg45-Trp49-eglin c (K\ni=10 nM for furin and 470 pM for PC7) demonstrate that optimizing flanking contacts by in vitro molecular evolution provides a powerful technique to generate specific inhibitors for each PC. These two derivatives of eglin c show that differences outside but near the active site of PCs favor both binding affinity and specificity of the inhibitor. These eglin c variants might serve as biotechnological tools to dissect the functions of furin and PC7 in the cell and at the membrane, for co-crystalization processes, and as lead compounds to design potent, specific and smaller therapeutic drugs.",

Thus, pro-domains are dual-function molecules, being the first substrate and first inhibitor encountered by PCs in cells. Evaluation in vitro of the inhibitory capacity of the seven complete pro-domains and of derived, short C-terminal dodecapeptides demonstrates their nanomolar potency and some specificity [44]. However, none is a specific inhibitor of a unique PC. The lack of pro-domain specificity is also observed in inhibition experiments in cell culture. Recently, overexpression in trans in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells of the wild-type PC5/6 pro-domain and a selection of key residue mutants efficiently inhibited the processing of an overexpressed substrate, proVEGF-C [45]. However, maturation of proVEGF-C is also decreased significantly by expression of the pro-domains of furin, PACE4 and PC7 in CHO cells. To date, there is no indication that specificity of inhibition can be achieved without significant structural modification of pro-domains. Nevertheless, because pro-domains have multiple interactions with PCs outside the catalytic site, bioengineering might result in more specific pro-domains. Co-crystalization of a pro-domain\u2013PC complex might provide the information required to map these interactions.",

In vitro, SPN4A/4.1 inactivates human furin (K\ni=13 pM) and PC2 (K\ni=0.92 nM) by a slow-binding mechanism and the formation of a SDS-stable acyl\u2013enzyme complex [41]. This kinetic trapping is typical of the serpin clade. That SPN4A/4.1 exerts potent inhibition on both furin and PC2 indicates a profound lack of selectivity between PCs in general. However, the removal of one amino acid in the RSL (AlaP6) generates a reduction of inhibition potency against PC2 (i.e. ID50 is 27-fold greater) but has no effect on furin. This change in specificity indicates that the RSL of SPN4A/4.1 is more amendable to modifications than other serpins such as \u03b11-AT-PDX.",

These bind slowly and competitively, and are irreversible inhibitors with low micromolar inhibition constants (IC50=5\u201310 \u03bcM), possibly by a chelate-coordinated interaction of the metal with the catalytic histidine of PCs [46] and Kex2 [47]. Although the free chelate alone is not inhibitory, the chelated metal salts are more potent than the solvated metal ions. Thus, the chelation of metal-based inhibitors to generate a prodrug serves to coordinate the delivery of the drug (either Zn2+ or Cu2+) to the active site of PCs. Modification and adjustment of the chelate might lead to greater inhibitory affinity and specificity for PCs. Also, as suggested by the authors, these metallodrugs might be developed further as wide-spectrum PC blockers for rapid intervention in aggressive viral infections and/or for bacterial detoxification.",
