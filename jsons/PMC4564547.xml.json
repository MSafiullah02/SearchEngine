Briefly, 3 days after boost, hybridoma cells were generated by fusing mouse plasma cells with SP2/0-Ag14 myeloma cells (ATCC) and were selected using HAT/HT selection medium. Monoclonal hybridoma cells were isolated by performing 2 rounds of limiting dilutions in 96-well flat-bottomed tissue culture plates. Isolated hybridoma cells were initially screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of secreted antibodies, using a soluble, transmembrane-deleted, trimeric glycoprotein of EBOV, SUDV, RESTV, TAFV, and BDBV as previously described [9, 10]. Plasmids encoding for soluble, transmembrane-deleted GP were kindly provided by Dr Ayato Takada.",

With the exception of the previously published S9 mAb, none of the other mAbs neutralized any of the Ebolavirus species (data not shown). In the absence of neutralizing activity, the focus was shifted to cross-reactive mAbs that can bind to all known Ebolavirus species. ELISA identified 4 immunoglobulin G1 mAbs (S3, S12, S17, and S33) that bound the GPs of all 5 Ebolavirus species, although the reactivity of S3 was typically lower than that of S12, S17, and S33 (Figure 1A\u2013D). This suggested that \u22651 conserved epitope on the GP was targeted by these mAbs. ",

Briefly, a 5-minute incubation step with or without 8 M urea was added after aspiration of the mAbs, and the avidity index was calculated as previously described for noroviruses, as follows: [(OD with urea)/(OD without urea)] \u00d7 100) [11]. The avidity for all mAbs was highest for the EBOV GP used during primary vaccination (Figure 2A). The avidity of mAb S33 was higher for all GPs, compared with avidities of the other mAbs. Interestingly, mAbs S12 and S17 showed the highest avidity for RESTV, which was not part of the immunization scheme. Surprisingly, while SUDV was used as a vaccination boost, most mAbs, except mAb S33, did not have high avidity for this antigen. ",

The percentage of binding competition was calculated as [1 \u2212 (OD competition)/(OD maximum binding of biotinylated mAbs)] \u00d7 100, as previously described for mAbs against SARS-CoV [12]. mAbs S12, S17, and S33 did not compete with S3; therefore, S3 recognized a unique epitope on the GP (Figure 2B). mAbs S12, S17, and S33 competed with both mAbs S12 and S17 with similar efficacy. Surprisingly, although mAb S33 competed with mAbs S12 and S17 in this assay, reciprocal competition was not observed. The 1-directional competition between S33 and mAbs S12 and S17 suggests that these mAbs recognized distinct epitopes that are close together, rather than overlapping, on the GP. Unfortunately, several attempts to identify the sequences of the conserved epitopes on the EBOV GP by using a phage display peptide library were not successful (data not shown).",
