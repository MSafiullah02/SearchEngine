Previous studies used traditional machine learning approaches to solve anomaly/fraud detection problems [2, 5, 23, 24], there has also been an increase in deep learning approaches to solve similar problems. These solutions have been predominately focusing on image problems and there is an opportunity for deep learning models to be applied within the health care domain to classify anomalies [12, 23, 26].",

            "text": "Logistic Regression (LR) is a classification algorithm that is used to predict the probability of a binary dependent variable. In the current context, the dependent variable contains data coded as 1 (anomaly) or 0 (normal). Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) is a powerful machine learning technique for classification, regression and ranking problems [18] which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble decision tree [18]. The XGB model is built in a multi step approach where each step, introduces a new weak learner to compensate the shortcomings of the existing weak learners [18]. Random Forest (RF) is a tree constructed algorithm from a set of possible trees with random features at each node. Random forest can be generated efficiently and the combination of large sets of random trees generally leads to accurate models to detect anomalies [22]. Moreover, the random forest algorithm has been used in this study due to its versatility in being applied to large data sets and feature importance [6]. Decision Tree (DT) is a simple and intuitive algorithm that utilizes a top-down approach in which the root node creates binary splits until a certain criteria is met [6]. In the current context of anomaly classification, the decision tree model outputs a predicted target class (anomaly or normal) for each terminal node produced. Decision Trees automatically reduce complexity, selection of features and the predictive analysis structure is understandable and interpretable [22].",
