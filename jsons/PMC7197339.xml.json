In Italy, front-line healthcare workers were disproportionately prone to COVID infection, and often contracted the most severe form of the disease. The risk specifically to surgeons is that the virus is transmitted primarily through aerosols\u2014droplets containing the virus. This puts anesthesiologists at particular risk during intubation and extubation, but the rest of the team is also susceptible. The risk of aerosol-generating procedures has led centers to minimize personnel in the operating room. Orthopaedics often requires the use of power tools with aerosolization of material putting the team at further increased risk in comparison to other surgical procedures. Although blood is not the preferred route of the virus, research supports the idea that COVID is an opportunistic invader. Consequently, blood donors in Wuhan are now screened for the virus.",

            "text": "The decision to defer clinic visits for up to three months may be fraught with concern over the long-term impact of delayed treatment. This is particularly true in conditions, such as DDH, where early detection and treatment are widely regarded to optimize outcomes. However, the risks of deferring treatment must be weighed against the risks of continuing treatment as usual during the COVID crisis. A unique feature of pediatric care is the number of caregivers and/or family members who typically accompany an infant or child to a clinic appointment. It is common to see two or three caregivers in clinic along with the child. In addition, there are typically a minimum of four healthcare workers in contact with the family during the visit. Each family member present could potentially be an asymptomatic or presymptomatic vector for viral transmission, increasing the chance of spreading infection to healthcare workers or other patients and families. Eliminating as many of these visits as possible during the peak of the pandemic can greatly reduce the chances of viral spread.",

            "text": "Another primary concern is for the safety of the child. Although initial impressions of COVID have been that children are not as susceptible to infection, a recent retrospective review of the epidemiology of pediatric cases in China suggested that infants were more susceptible to the severe infection than older children, with 10.6% of cases severe or critical in infants younger than one year of age.20 For a condition such as DDH, most children coming to the orthopaedic clinic for DDH are younger than one year of age; therefore, these patients represent a potentially vulnerable cohort during this time. Children with cerebral palsy also represent a particularly at-risk patient cohort because of the substantial comorbidities typically involved. Although a decision to defer patients with these conditions for three months does introduce concerns about long-term impact, the heightened risk of viral transmission between patients, caregivers, and healthcare workers outweighs the risk of treatment deferral for three months in many cases.",
