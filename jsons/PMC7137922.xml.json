In response to this report, both the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed research and prevention strategies to reduce emerging infectious diseases4, 5 and improve preparedness for outbreaks. At CDC, this plan led to the development and implementation of many new programmes designed to improve epidemiology and laboratory capacity at the national, state, and local levels. In the 1990s and early 2000s, substantial complementary investments were made to build similar, multilevel capacity against bioterrorism threats. During the past two decades, these networks, systems, and programmes have helped to forge strong links between clinical, research, and public health communities and strengthened US capacity to detect and respond to national and international outbreaks.",

We discuss vaccine-preventable diseases and the substantial successes and persistent challenges in their control; health-care-associated infections (HAIs), a leading preventable cause of death; emerging zoonotic and vector-borne diseases and their spread across a globalised world; foodborne infections, increasingly linked to new sources of contamination; and the intersecting epidemics of HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), chronic viral hepatitis, and tuberculosis. Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, several of which have become or are becoming resistant to all available drugs, are intensifying these threats. In addition to their effect on human health, these diseases cause substantial health-care, workplace, and other societal costs. We discuss priority actions needed to meet these challenges including modernisation of existing surveillance systems to better inform public health action; enhancement of public health laboratories to incorporate the latest molecular technologies for improved disease detection and outbreak response; and strengthening of the clinical and public health interface to facilitate information exchange and leverage changes in health care to improve prevention and control of infectious diseases.",

Immunisations against pneumococcal disease and rotavirus infection have had a substantial effect. Routine vaccinations for infants with a seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), which began in 2000, greatly decreased the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in young children, and indirectly in adults.7 From 1998\u201399 to 2007, overall incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease decreased by 45%;8 in children (aged <5 years) the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease decreased from around 99 cases per 100 000 population during 1998\u201399 to 21 cases per 100 000 population in 2008.9 In 2010, a 13-valent vaccine (PCV13) was introduced that offered protection against an additional six serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae. By the end of 2011, rates of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by these six serotypes had decreased by nearly 90% in children younger than 5 years and by 45\u201364% in adults compared with pre-PCV13 introduction rates.10 Rotavirus vaccination, recommended for US infants from 2006, has had a substantial effect on the number of hospital admissions for diarrhoea in young children. Compared with pre-vaccine years, an estimated 77 000 fewer admissions for diarrhoea occurred in US children (aged <5 years) during 2008\u201309, which reduced hospital costs by around $242 million.11 Substantial and sustained decreases in rotavirus activity have occurred during every rotavirus season since the vaccine was introduced, with the number of positive rotavirus tests decreasing by 74\u201390% during 2010\u201311 and 2011\u201312 rotavirus seasons compared with pre-vaccine years.12 The success of these vaccines could mask the toll and dangers of these once prevalent infections; thus focused efforts are needed to communicate the continued importance of immunisations.",

Vaccination protects against the HPV types that cause 70% of cervical and most of the other HPV-attributable cancers. One of the two available vaccines also protects against genital warts. However, uptake of the three-dose HPV vaccination series has been disappointingly slow. In 2011, only 53% of girls aged 13\u201317 years had received at least one vaccine dose and only 35% had completed the series.16 Efforts to motivate health-care providers to offer the HPV vaccine and educate parents and young women of its cancer-preventing capacity are important components of this disease-reducing strategy.",

Although the USA was declared to have eliminated measles in 2000,17 around 50\u2013100 imported cases occur every year. In 2011, however, more than 220 measles cases and 17 outbreaks were reported in the USA, mainly linked to large outbreaks in several European countries.18 This number was the highest yearly total of US reported cases of measles since the elimination of this disease until 2014, when ongoing outbreaks had resulted in almost 288 cases by May 23.19 These cases emphasise the importance of maintaining high vaccination coverage and ensuring appropriate messaging for travellers. Such cases can also present specific concerns for health-care settings. Because cases of measles are rare, health-care providers might not recognise signs or symptoms, which can facilitate further spread, including by health-care providers who do not have complete immunisations or immunity.20 Containment of measles outbreaks requires substantial public health resources. Estimated public health costs from two 2011 outbreaks in Utah affecting 13 people exceeded $330 000.21\n",

In the mid-1990s, pertussis vaccination shifted from whole-cell to an acellular vaccine to reduce adverse events. However, in the mid-2000s, illness in children and teens began to rise despite high vaccination rates, which prompted new recommendations for a pertussis booster (Tdap) in teenagers.25 Even with these new recommendations, pertussis rates have continued to increase, with substantial outbreaks in California in 2010,26 and in Washington State in 2011\u201312.27 A retrospective study28 in California showed that waning immunity from the acellular vaccines was the probable cause of disease resurgence. Research is in progress to improve definitions for predictors of immunity and to strengthen control efforts. Priority activities are focused on reduction of pertussis-related deaths, which occur mainly in young infants, prompting US recommendations for Tdap vaccination for pregnant women and people in close contact with infants.29\n",

Established as the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System in 1970, NHSN includes more than 12 000 facilities in all 50 states and extends beyond hospitals to include outpatient dialysis centres and nursing homes. Numbers of participating facilities and types of data obtained are expected to increase in the future. Reports of NHSN data, including national and state-specific reports of standardised infection ratios, have shown many successes in the reduction of the burden of certain HAIs, including a 41% decrease in central-line-associated bloodstream infections, 17% decrease in surgical-site infections, and 7% decrease in catheter-associated urinary tract infections in 2011 when compared with baseline (2008, 2009) rates.43\n",

Among Enterobacteriaceae infections, several types are often transmitted in health-care settings including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp, and Enterobacter spp. The percentage of health-care-associated Enterobacteriaceae showing resistance to carbapenems increased from 1% to 4% during the past decade.47 CRE infections can be severe, with mortality rates more than 40%,48 and can easily spread from hospitals to other health-care settings in communities. CRE containing New Delhi metallo-\u03b2-lactamase (NDM) are of particular concern; NDM enzymes can be encoded on plasmids, which spreads multidrug-resistance to other Enterobacteriaceae and other bacteria. Identification of patients colonised by or infected with CRE and segregation of patients and staff can reduce these infections,49 but additional steps are needed. A crucial measure to control antibiotic resistance is effective implementation of antibiotic stewardship programmes to restrict the use of these drugs for appropriate indications.

These disease outbreaks represent the first time that Rhipicephalus sanguineus, the brown dog tick, has been confirmed as a vector for Rocky Mountain spotted fever in the USA.76, 77 This tick feeds on dogs at every stage of its life cycle and usually lives in and around homes. CDC, the Arizona Department of Health Services, the Indian Health Service, and tribal health departments are working to test a prevention and vector control strategy for Rocky Mountain spotted fever that includes homeowner education, use of acaricides, tick collaring, and control of the local dog population.78 Additionally, within the past 4 years, two previously unknown tick-borne pathogens whose epidemiology, transmission patterns, and clinical spectrum of illness remain unclear, have been identified in the USA: an Ehrlichia muris-like agent in Minnesota and Wisconsin79 and the Heartland phlebovirus in Missouri.80\n",

In the USA, more than 80 state and federal laboratories participate in this surveillance system and submit PFGE patterns from six bacterial pathogens to a CDC database to identify similar cases of foodborne illnesses that might signal an outbreak. Over the past 15 years, this system has detected hundreds of outbreaks, enabling faster and more accurate responses. PulseNet-triggered investigations have resulted in the recall of more than 1\u00b75 billion pounds of contaminated food and have prompted new actions by industry and food regulatory agencies to make food safer. Since 2006, data from foodborne disease investigations have identified more than a dozen newly implicated foods in foodborne disease outbreaks (panel\n). Data from nearly 4600 outbreaks in 1998\u20132008 were used to help to establish the proportion of foodborne illnesses attributable to specific food commodities across 17 major food categories.

Inherent in these efforts are well established links between clinical, public health, and research communities working with non-traditional partners such as industry, law enforcement, businesses, and the media. Although at their core these collaborations need to be established locally, such crucial partnerships have to extend across state, national, and international levels. Together, these alliances can form a global infrastructure and system to detect and control infectious diseases. With that aim, in February, 2014, the USA and other nations joined WHO, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, and the World Organization for Animal Health in a new global health security agenda designed to enhance strategies to prevent, detect, and respond to threats of infectious disease.123 Partner countries will work together to meet a series of objectives covering crucial issues affecting control of infectious disease such as antimicrobial resistance, biosafety and biosecurity, global disease detection and response networks, and emergency responses.",

Despite this persistent challenge, extraordinary achievements in science and technology continue to bolster the capacity to recognise and respond to these threats. Scientifically, next-generation sequencing and state-of-the-art bioinformatics capabilities are transforming the practice of microbiology and the speed at which infectious pathogens can be detected and analysed.85, 124 These technologies provide a new level of information about infectious pathogens and therefore offer tremendous opportunities for public health efforts to detect and control outbreaks, target antimicrobial resistance, and develop and refine treatments and vaccines.125, 126, 127 Additionally, the increasing understanding of the role of human microbiomes in disease development and new links between infectious agents and chronic diseases opens new possibilities for disease prevention and treatment.128 Advances in electronic communications have also been essential and have enabled rapid sharing of health and safety information and expertise by health-care and public health workers, researchers, law enforcement, the media, and private individuals. These communication capacities can facilitate and enhance research and public health partnerships worldwide, generating broad sharing of research findings and health updates in near real time. The latest surge in health communications has come from social media tools, which are increasingly being used to extend the reach of public health information. To ensure that these rapidly changing scientific and technological advances are routinely used in public health is a crucial challenge and priority.",
