EV-C117 was first isolated from a pediatric patient with pneumonia in 2010 in Lithuania, and EV-C118 from two children in Israel diagnosed with acute otitis media and community-acquired pneumonia. 11, 12 The genotype EV-C105, to which the Cyprus isolate belongs, was only recently discovered in a respiratory sample in Peru and a fecal sample from a case of fatal acute flaccid paralysis in Congo. 4, 5 A characteristic of all members of this new EV-C subspecies is their distinct 5 0 -UTR. Lukashev et al. hypothesized that this 5 0 -UTR may have been derived from an animal enterovirus. 5 Future recombination with other EV-C or even interspecies recombination, could lead to an increasing number of enteroviruses exhibiting this new 5 0 -UTR. 13, 14 Even though these enteroviruses have so far been isolated mostly from respiratory samples, Tapparel et al. 7 noted that based on its genomic features, EV-C104 could theoretically infect the central nervous system. Despite marked differences in the 5 0 -UTR of the EV-A, EV-B, EV-D, and 'classic' EV-C, completely conserved regions exist, which has allowed for the design of non-degenerate primers and/or probes that are able to amplify all enteroviruses with a high sensitivity, which is necessary for diagnostic applications. However, the alignment of all EV 5 0 -UTRs revealed that the sequences of the enteroviruses belonging to this new clade exhibit differences in several of the exact regions that are conventionally used for diagnosis. In addition to our own observation, Tapparel et al. also noted in the case of EV-C104 that their enterovirus specific real-time PCR assay did not amplify this new genotype. 7 For this reason, new real-time RT-PCR primers and probes were designed based on the alignment, in order to detect all enteroviruses belonging to this new clade (see Table 1 ). A plasmid containing the 5 0 -UTR sequence of the EV-C105 Cyprus isolate was used as positive control. The new primer/probe set was able to amplify the new isolate as well as serial dilutions of the plasmid down to a concentration of 200 plasmids/ml. Further validation will verify the reliability of the assay to detect all members of the new HEV-C subtype. With this report, the authors hope to increase awareness in laboratories to these newly emerging enteroviruses. As the detection of EV-C105 so far in Peru, Congo, Burundi, and now Cyprus indicates a worldwide distribution, more countries are likely to report this novel enterovirus soon. Improved surveillance should improve detection rates and the discovery of further genotypes belonging to this enterovirus subspecies. Further studies are needed to clarify the actual prevalence and clinical importance of these novel enteroviruses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 495, "end": 498, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"},
