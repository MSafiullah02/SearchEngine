In 1996, a WHO committee examining priorities for research and development emphasised the need to direct increased investment at the challenge of non-communicable diseases8 whereas, 9 years later, WHO published what amounted to a call to action, drawing attention to the growing human and economic toll that these disorders create.9 In 2007, the World Health Assembly endorsed a global strategy on prevention and control of non-communicable diseases,10 after two major initiatives to tackle the determinants of these diseases\u2014the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control11 and the Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health.12 Subsequently, a series in The Lancet described a range of inexpensive interventions that could be scaled up to control non-communicable diseases.13, 14 In 2008, WHO endorsed a non-communicable disease action plan at the 61st World Health Assembly.15 But has this rhetoric been translated into a financial reality at WHO?

Data for the global burden of disease were taken from the WHO World Health Report 200416 and from Mathers and Loncar's 2006 global burden of disease projections.17 We quantified burden of disease with use of deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), which provide an aggregate measure of years of life lost because of disability and premature death. The data sources and detailed calculations of these measures are described elsewhere.18 In brief, in this Article we used the WHO's three broad categories of International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes that are used in the Global Burden of Disease project. Infectious disease refers to the type-I group of communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional disorders (although not exclusively infectious diseases, these are overwhelmingly dominant, accounting for roughly four-fifths of this category, expressed both as burden of disease and WHO expenditure); non-communicable disease refers to the type-II cluster of chronic disorders; and injuries and violence consist of WHO's type-III cluster (WHO, 2004).",

WHO member states pledge to commit a specified proportion of the total assessed contributions, which is calculated according to each country's wealth and population size. Conversely, voluntary contributions are allocated to programmes according to the preferences of the donors involved. Together, these two sources of funds constitute the WHO regular budget and its extra-budgetary funds, respectively. Third, because the low-income and middle-income member states, which are the main recipients of WHO funds, have a much greater role in determining the regular budget than the extra-budgetary health priorities, we compared whether the distribution of the regular budget more closely aligned with the burden of disease than did the extra-budgetary allocations.",

However, other regions worldwide still have a substantial burden of poverty and disease, although less than that in Africa. One such region is the Western Pacific region as defined by WHO, where almost three-quarters of all deaths are attributable to non-communicable diseases. In Africa, the burden of disease is almost the reverse: less than a quarter of mortality is from non-communicable diseases, and roughly three-quarters is from infectious diseases.

These considerations obviously apply to diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza, thus justifying expenditure on them even though the current burden of disease attributable to them is zero for SARS and negligible for avian influenza from a global perspective. Some other infectious diseases share this potential, such as cholera, but most do not, either because they are limited geographically by the distribution of vectors or other factors, or because effective control programmes are already in place. Another consideration is the economic burden of disease. The WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health drew attention to the economic effects of the common diseases afflicting the poorest countries in sub-Saharan Africa, which are dominated by infections.19 However, evidence is growing for the substantial economic consequences of non-communicable diseases.20, 21 The diseases do not seem to differ substantially with regard to their effect on the economy.",
