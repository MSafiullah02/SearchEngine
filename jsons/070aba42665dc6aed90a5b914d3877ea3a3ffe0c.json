Here, we extracted demographics, comorbidities, and vital signs from 34 20,088 patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at University of Utah Health clinics, in Salt 35 Lake County, Utah; and for a subset of tested patients, we performed manual chart review to 36 examine symptoms and exposure risks. To determine risk factors for testing positive, we used 37 logistic regression to calculate the odds of testing positive, adjusting for symptoms and prior 38 exposure. Of the 20,088 individuals, 1,229 (6.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We found 39",
