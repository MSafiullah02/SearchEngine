Suicide is estimated to occur at a higher rate 49 among physicians than the general population and perhaps even other professions (1,2), however, 50 estimates by profession vary (3). Several medical organizations have begun launching various 51 initiatives to address physician well-being, yet efforts to address physician suicide remain 52 organization-or institution-specific.

Currently available information is insufficient to draw 383 conclusions about physician subgroups or their cultural or health system contexts. Such information 384 on understudied physician subgroups could better inform future revisions of public health, 385 prevention, and postvention programs to include diversity-sensitive suicide prevention approaches. 386 The strengths of this scoping literature review are its breadth and inclusiveness in examining multiple 387 types of published literature in scholarly journals. However, due to the volume of citations generated 388 by the searches, we excluded grey literature (e.g. conference proceedings, poster presentations, etc.) 389 and snowballing of references was not performed. Additionally, physician suicide involves multiple 390 disciplines, and searching additional electronic databases of peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed 391 literature may be appropriate for future updates of such a literature review. Finally, additional articles 392 have been published on physician suicide since the end of the search period of April 2018. Excluding 393 non-English language publications may have led to overrepresentation of countries where English is 394 the official language. Among the 46 non-English language papers excluded (Figure 1), potentially 395 relevant papers were published in German, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish, Japanese, Chinese, French, 396Swedish, and Hungarian, which could reveal relevant themes in physician suicide, including cultural 397or health system context. Future studies could identify opportunities for cross-disciplinary and cross-398 cultural learning and suicide prevention. 399This scoping review offers a landscape view of physician suicide literature and opportunities for 401 further work on physician suicide prevention. Interventions are needed at multiple levels to mitigate 402 the risks of physician suicide, which could begin with an organized public health approach. As a part 403 of such an approach, consistency and reliability of data and information about physician suicides 404 could be improved. Data limitations partly contribute to these issues. For example, annual rates of 405 physician suicide reported and quoted may result from extrapolated estimates from old data, such as 406 those collected byCraig and Pitts in 1968 (15). Reliable and trackable data and information can 407 provide more continuously updated insights into actual suicide mortality rate ratios of physician 408 suicide compared to other populations(70). Also, systems could be developed to better monitor 409 physician suicides, offer early warnings of possible suicide clusters or contagion, and may improve 410 investigation and interventions for the benefit of physicians' and public health. Physician suicide 411should be approached as a public health issue and as a shared responsibility between individuals and 412institutions to prevent physician deaths by suicide. 413 TIL, SP, and CYAC designed the study and performed study selection. RS performed the literature 415search. TIL and SP extracted data, TIL performed computational analyses, and TIL, SP, and CYAC 416",
