Tropical infections, on the other hand, are relatively uncommon in children in developed countries, except those with pertinent travel histories or recent immigration. With a few notable exceptions, most tropical infections seen in developed countries are likely to cause illnesses that do not result in the need for critical care. As a result, many pediatric intensivists have minimal exposure and training related to these diseases. There are two scenarios in which life-threatening tropical diseases are likely to be encountered in developed countries: (1) Imported diseases seen in returned travelers or immigrant children and (2) Locally prevalent diseases seen during mission trips to tropical countries. Of course, clinicians working in developing countries are likely to see many of these diseases and conditions almost daily. These clinicians likely will have a different level of experience and expertise with these diseases. As such, the chapter will be geared towards those clinicians working in developed countries, focusing on those diseases that either present in developed countries after travel/immigration or those that are encountered by healthcare providers who engage in disaster relief and/or mission work.",

Sixteen percent of these -225 cases -occurred in children (age <18 years). Of the 86 children for whom chemoprophylaxis information was known, 27 (31 %) were reported as having taken chemoprophylaxis -18 of these (67 %) had taken an appropriate regimen, though only four (22 %) reported adherence. Physicians practicing in the US are unlikely to encounter malaria frequently, which can make it more diffi cult to include it in the differential diagnosis of fever. However, failure to consider a diagnosis of malaria in a febrile child returning from an endemic area can lead to signifi cant delays in diagnosis -in different series, between 35 % [ 12 ] and 90 % [ 13 ] of pediatric cases were initially misdiagnosed. In children, acute malaria is often mistaken for a viral illness or acute gastroenteritis due to associated nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. This delay in recognition, compounded with lack of immediate availability of antimalarial drugs in some US hospitals, can contribute to signifi cant morbidity and mortality.",

            "text": "The malaria parasite, Plasmodia , is a sporozoan parasite of red blood cells (RBCs) transmitted to mammals by a mosquito vector. Human malaria is caused by fi ve species of Plasmodium , namely falciparum , ovale , vivax , malariae and the recently characterized species knowlesi (\"monkey malaria\" -malaria of long-tailed and pig-tailed macaque monkeys, found on the island of Borneo and peninsular Malaysia, though it can also infect humans [ 14 ] ). All of the species of Plasmodium causing malaria in humans are transmitted by mosquito species of the genus Anopheles . Only female mosquitoes bite, and the sporozoites are transmitted to the skin from the saliva of a biting female mosquito, after which they eventually make it into the bloodstream through the network of capillaries in the subcutaneous tissue. After the sporozoites are introduced to the blood through the mosquito bite, they remain in the circulation for approximately 45 min before infecting a hepatocyte [ 15 ] . For the next 6-15 days, the parasites develop in hepatocytes (the incubation period) (the sporozoites at this stage are known as schizonts) and are then released into the circulation as merozoites, where they infect RBCs. The life cycle of the P. falciparum is shown in Fig. 37 .1 [ 16 ] . The sporozoites of both P. vivax and P. ovale can become dormant in the hepatocyte in a form referred to as a hypnozoite. The hypnozoite may emerge months to years after initial infection to cause the relapses that characterize infections with these two species [ 15 ] . The molecular and cellular events during the parasite life cycle infl uence the severity of the disease. Disease occurs only as a result of the asexual blood stage after the parasite leaves the liver and begins to invade and grow inside red blood cells ( RBCs ). All human Plasmodium spp. invade by the same mechanism, but P . falciparum reaches high parasitemia because of greater fl exibility in the receptor pathways that it can use to invade all RBCs. RBCs infected with P . falciparum must bind to endothelium or placenta for the parasite to avoid spleendependent killing mechanisms, but this binding also leads to much of the pathology (Reprinted from Ref. [ 16 ] . With permission from Nature Publishing Group) Within the RBCs, the sporozoites grow to form a trophozoite, dividing several times to produce new merozoites. The merozoites are released into the bloodstream, where they are free to invade new RBCs. The parasites feed on hemoglobin and other RBC materials, which causes damage and eventual destruction of the RBCs. Infection caused by P. falciparum , is associated with the worst morbidity and mortality due to the ability to sequester itself in the capillaries and cause major organ dysfunction [ 17 ] . Although classically viewed as \"benign\", infections with P.vivax and ovale can have severe clinical manifestations, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe anemia, spleen rupture [ 18 ] , and in chronic untreated infections, severe malnutrition [ 19 ] . P. malariae can result in long-lasting infections and if untreated can persist asymptomatically in the human host for years, even a lifetime [ 9 ] .",

            "text": "The idea that the characteristic febrile paroxysms of malaria are induced by parasite products released at the time of schizont rupture originated in the nineteenth century [ 24 ] . Malaria parasites induce the release of cytokines in a similar way as bacterial endotoxin [ 15 ] , although they are much less potent. Merozoites contain (and release upon rupture) many glycophosphoinositol moieties that can activate the host infl ammatory response in macrophages and dendritic cells via Toll like receptor 2 (TLR2) and to a lesser extent TLR4 as well as scavenger receptors such as CD36 [ 16 , 20 -22 ] . Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1 and gamma interferon (\u03b3-IFN) are produced and, in turn, induce release of a cascade of other pro-infl ammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, and IL-18. These are balanced by production of anti-infl ammatory cytokines, notably IL-10 [ 15 ] . Cytokines are responsible for many of the signs and symptoms of infection, particularly fever and malaise. In addition, cytokines upregulate the endothelial expression of adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 through which P. falciparum -infected RBCs promoting cytoadherence, providing a pathogenic link between infl ammation and adherence/sequestration. Some investigators have suggested that severe malaria and bacterial septicemia may have a common cytokine-mediated pathology [ 15 , 24 , 25 ] . Several studies have shown a positive correlation between blood cytokine levels and prognosis in severe Falciparum malaria, although the relationship is far from linear. For example, some authors [ 26 ] have found that appropriate levels of TNF\u03b1 exhibit antiparasitic effects, and a high TNF\u03b1 production capacity protects from severe malaria [ 27 ] . On the other hand, excessive TNF\u03b1 levels are associated with complications such as severe anemia [ 28 ] , and a low ratio of plasma levels IL-10/ TNF\u03b1 is associated with severe malarial anemia [ 29 ] .",

Infected RBCs have reduced deformability and altered surface characteristics and can be sequestered and destroyed by the spleen. In addition, once the parasites successfully complete the erythrocytic stage of their life-cycle, they replicate, and are released as merozoites with rupture of their host RBCs, leading to intravascular hemolysis [ 30 ] . In a recent study [ 31 ] from Mali, children with severe malarial anemia and markers of active intravascular hemolysis also demonstrated reduced whole blood levels of nitrite and increased NO consumption relative to controls, which is evidence of NO depletion. It is likely that the mechanism is similar to other hemolytic anemias, where free plasma hemoglobin reacts with NO produced by NO synthases to form biologically inactive nitrate. Because NO plays a critical role in downregulating the expression of adhesion molecules [ 32 ] and maintaining blood fl ow and vascular tone, the catabolism of NO and arginine from intravascular hemolysis in malaria likely promotes infl ammation and endothelial activation [ 33 ] , thus increasing the cytoadherence of abnormal RBCs. Due to its complexity, erythrocyte invasion is an inefficient process and may be completed in only a small fraction of erythrocytes targeted for infection. Parasite antigens are shed during RBC entry, and many of these parasite encoded erythrocyte-adhesive proteins are present at high levels in plasma. They adhere to uninfected erythrocytes and resulting in IgG or complement binding to erythrocytes, leading to their clearance from circulation [ 34 ] . As a result of this binding, the direct Coombs test for immunoglobulins and/or complement deposited on the surface of the RBCs is frequently positive. The antibodies giving rise to the positive test are not autoimmune, but rather directed against adsorbed malarial antigens [ 35 ] . In addition to destruction of infected and uninfected erythrocytes, decreased erythrocyte production and/or suppression of the erythropoietic response contributes to the severe malarial anemia [ 34 ] . Although the cumulative data strongly support that there is imbalance of cytokines in malarial anemia, the cytokine pathways have not been fully characterized.",

As a result, only young forms (\"ring\") are found in the bloodstream, the rest of the parasite burden is \"sequestered\" in the microvascular beds of many organs.

Parasitized RBCs express an adhesion molecule on their membrane, P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) [ 16 ] . This protein mediates adhesion to various membrane receptors, most importantly CD36 and ICAM 1, but also chondroitin sulphate A (CSA), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM 1), E selectin, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM 1), and integrins and selectins [ 15 ] . Parasitized red blood cells (pRBCs) and unparasitized RBCs (uRBCs) become less deformable during P. falciparum malaria and, consequently, plug the 3-7 \u03bcm-diameter capillaries with stiff RBCs, which have an average diameter of 7.5 \u03bcm [ 36 ] . The altered surface membrane of RBCs leads to micro-agglutination of parasitized RBCs as well as clumping of unparasitized RBCs around parasitized RBCs to form micro-thrombi (\"rosettes\") [ 36 ] . A role of complement receptor 1(CR1) in RBC rosette formation has been postulated as individuals with polymorphisms in the CR1 gene, who express low levels of CR1, show greatly reduced rosette formation, and are protected against severe disease [ 37 ] . While the mechanisms responsible for cytoadherence and agglutination are well described, their pathologic consequences are less clear. Several mechanisms that might cause damage to host endothelium have been proposed, including mechanical obstruction of blood fl ow, with vascular leak and subendothelial hemorrhage, activation of endothelium, platelets and leukocytes [ 38 ] , followed by systemic or local production and deposition of pro-infl ammatory cytokines [ 16 ] that further upregulate the expression of the adhesion receptors, thus closing the loop between infl ammation and sequestration.",

Infection results in destruction of both infected and uninfected RBCs leading to anemia and decreased O2 carrying capacity, microvascular obstruction, and infl ammation, all of which result in decreased tissue perfusion [ 16 ] . Parasite antigens are thought to activate platelets [ 38 ] , which in turn provide adhesion receptors to microvascular beds originally devoid of these receptors [ 39 ] . The activated platelets contribute to the activation of the infl ammatory response, increased levels of endothelial cell adhesion molecules, and sequestration. These events lead to disruption of the local microvasculature with ensuing vascular leak, potentially hemorrhage in various tissue beds.",

            "text": "The clinical manifestations of malaria are dependent on the previous immune status of the host, which varies with the age of the patient and the epidemiological context in which the infection is acquired. Holo-endemic areas (i.e. areas where essentially every individual in the population is infected) have high intensity, constant malaria transmission. Hypo-endemic or unstable transmission areas have a low, erratic, and markedly seasonal transmission pattern. In holo-endemic areas, infection is most severe in children between 1 and 3 years old. The severe manifestations, such as cerebral malaria, severe anemia, and shock are encountered in this age group and explain the high mortality rate in the pediatric population. Children less than 1 year of age are protected by passive maternal antibodies and by a higher percentage of hemoglobin F, which retards parasite development [ 40 ] . As children age, constant exposure to infection leads to a boost in immunity and a situation called \"premonition\", where infections cause little to no problem to the host and parasitemia may either be eradicated or continue asymptomatically. As a consequence, an individual may be parasitized, but not ill. In a symptomatic and parasitized individual, the parasites may be causing the fever or may be a \"red herring\" -there is no defi nitive means of distinguishing between malarial disease and incidental malarial infection as indicated by relative quantities of parasitemia. As a result, in endemic settings, a positive malaria test does not necessarily mean that malaria is the cause of the illness. In contrast, in hypo-endemic areas where transmission is too sporadic to promote \"premonition\", symptomatic infections are more common and the severe forms of disease, such as cerebral malaria, severe anemia, may be encountered at any age [ 15 ] .",

The fi rst symptoms of malaria are nonspecifi c and similar to the symptoms of a minor systemic viral illness [ 44 ] . Signs and symptoms include headache, fatigue, abdominal discomfort, muscle and joint aches, usually followed by fever, chills, perspiration, anorexia, vomiting and worsening malaise. This leads to frequent over-diagnosis in endemic areas and conversely, under-diagnosis in non-endemic areas where many other more commonly encountered illnesses are considered fi rst. If the infection continues untreated, the fever in P. vivax and P. ovale may regularize to a 2-day cycle (tertian malaria) and P. malariae to a 3-day cycle (quartan malaria). P. falciparum remains erratic for longer and usually doesn't regularize to a tertian pattern or, conversely, may turn into a daily fever cycle (quotidian malaria) [ 15 ] Older textbooks used to emphasize the diagnostic importance of these \"fever charts\", however many clinical studies have showed that these are neither sensitive nor specifi c for a diagnosis of malaria and reliance on the fever periodicity may miss a signifi cant number of cases [ 30 ] .",

The WHO defi nitions for severe malaria are listed in Table 37 .2 [ 45 ] . This progression may occur within a few hours, although the risk factors and the specifi c pathogenic mechanisms of development of severe malaria are still subject to controversy. Hyperparasitemia as a marker of disease severity should be interpreted with caution. Two patients with the same peripheral parasitemia may have as much as a 100-fold difference in the total number of parasites in the body. In \"benign\" malarias (non-falciparum) where there is no sequestration, blood parasitemia is a reliable estimate of total parasite biomass. However in P. falciparum malaria, only the fi rst third of the asexual life cycle can be seen and the remaining two-thirds of the parasitized cells are sequestered. As a consequence there might be large discrepancies between the number of parasites in the peripheral (circulating) blood and the number of parasites in the body (the parasite burden) -sequestration \"hides\" the parasites causing harm. As such, some patients appear to tolerate high parasitemia with little adverse effect, whereas others die with low parasite counts [ 15 ] (notwithstanding the role of covert co-infections). The predominance of more mature parasites on the blood fi lm suggests greater sequestered parasite biomass and carries a worse prognosis for any parasitemia than a predominance of younger forms. The presence of intra-neutrophilic phagocytosed malaria pigment (more than 5 % of the neutrophils) also refl ects the degree of previous schizogony and is also a valuable prognostic index. Measurement of proteins released by the parasite such as Pf HRP2 in plasma provides a good method of assessing this hidden pathogenic sequestered biomass [ 46 ] -a useful addition in cases where the severity of the disease seems discrepant with the measured parasitemia. The case fatality in people receiving treatment for severe malaria is typically 10-20 % [ 44 ] . However, if left untreated, it is fatal in the majority of cases.",

In addition, \"exclusion of other causes of encephalopathy\" as required in the WHO defi nition of cerebral malaria may call for investigations that are not routinely available in developing countries. Without a standard diagnostic criterion for cerebral malaria, a useful clinical indicator is the presence of malarial retinopathy, which consists of retinal whitening -as a consequence of retinal ischemia, vessel changes (whitening, \"tramlining\"), retinal hemorrhages, and papilledema as seen in Fig. 37 .3 [ 47 ] . In a prospective autopsy study [ 48 ] from Malawi, 24 % of the children who fulfi lled the usual criteria for cerebral malaria before death had evidence at post mortem of an alternative cause for the coma.

Altered sensorium might be present from the outset, or might develop slowly over a period of several days. Signs of irritability, restlessness or psychotic behavior can be the initial manifestations of cerebral involvement. In children with cerebral malaria, coma usually develops rapidly, and often follows seizures. In children with cerebral malaria, seizures occur in approximately 60-70 % of cases [ 50 ] . In a study [ 51 ] of 65 Kenyan children with cerebral malaria, 40 (62 %) had seizures after admission and ten (15 %) had subtle seizures, manifesting as nystagmoid eye movements, irregular breathing, excessive salivation, and conjugate eye deviation. Seizures were often repetitive and prolonged, and 18 children (28 %) had an episode of status epilepticus. Brainstem signs are common and are associated with other features of high intracranial pressure [ 50 ] . Common signs include changes in pupillary size and reaction and disorders of conjugate gaze and eye movements. Other signs include abnormal respiratory patterns, motor abnormalities of tone and refl exes (usually upper motor neuron), posturing (decerebrate, decorticate, or opisthotonic posturing) -the latter usually associated with cerebral edema. Intracranial hypertension occurs in virtually all children with cerebral malaria [ 47 , 52 ] . While the etiology is multifactorial, the most likely cause is increased cerebral blood volume as a result of sequestration of infected and noninfected erythroctyes [ 50 ] , coupled with an alteration of the blood -brain barrier [ 48 ] . Focal disruptions in the barrier at sites of sequestration could result in the exposure of sensitive perivascular neuronal cells to plasma proteins and increased concentrations of cytokines and metabolites caused by abnormalities in microcirculation. Although most children with cerebral malaria regain consciousness within 48 h and seem to make a full neurological recovery, approximately 20 % die and 10 % have persistent neurological sequelae [ 50 ] .",

The underlying causes of severe malarial anemia are multifactorial and involve both direct and indirect destruction of parasitized and nonparasitized erythrocytes, ineffective erythropoiesis, and dyserythropoiesis [ 34 ] . Mortality of children with asymptomatic severe malarial anemia is low (around 1 %), but rises to more than 30 % when anemia is complicated by severe respiratory distress and metabolic acidosis [ 53 ] . \"Blackwater fever\" is a rare, but feared complication. A rapid and massive intravascular hemolysis of parasitized and nonparasitized red blood cells results in hemoglobinuria and acute onset anemia and is accompanied by high fever, hepatic involvement, and renal failure. Unfortunately, even with aggressive treatment, this complication is often fatal [ 23 ] . Activation of the coagulation cascade and platelets has been widely reported in malaria [ 39 ] . Typical disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with the presence of bleeding is reported in 5-10 % of severe malaria cases [ 23 ] -1 % of all cases -probably less frequently in children. Thrombocytopenia is a common fi nding and is attributable to sequestration in the spleen or increased consumption secondary to activation of coagulation system.",

The etiology of the metabolic acidosis in this case is multifactorial and includes increased lactate production from the parasite, decreased hepatic metabolism [ 15 ] , recent seizure activity, hypovolemia, cardiac dysfunction and sequestration obstructing the microvasculature causing tissue hypoxia. While the relative contribution of each of these factors is still subject to debate, it is likely that hypovolemia, by causing a volume concentrated and sluggish circulation, acts synergistically with other factors leading to cytoadhesion, increasing the likelihood of microvascular obstruction. In children, respiratory distress (deep breathing, Kussmaul's respiration, tachypnea) is usually a clinical sign of metabolic acidosis [ 15 ] . It can be misinterpreted as cardiac failure and circulatory overload, which rarely occurs in children [ 55 ] .",

The sensitivity and specifi city of the RDT's vary with the species and the antigen targeted [ 59 ] . In a recent meta-analysis comparing performance of RDTs with the reference standard -microscopy -with or without PCR, the average sensitivities of the most commonly used RDTs were 93-95 %, while the average specifi cities where 95-98 % [ 60 ] . Caution needs to be exercised when translating these performance characteristics from an endemic to a non-endemic area, because the sensitivity of the RDTs decreases sharply when parasite density is below 200/ \u03bcl, as may be the case with imported malaria. A positive test is useful, though a negative test should be confi rmed by serial microscopy [ 61 ] . In the US, there is only one RDT approved by the FDA, Binax Now \u00ae. Its use is unlikely to become widespread, because the manufacturer requires that the laboratory prepare a positive test with known malaria infected blood for quality assurance each time a sample is tested with the RDT and malaria infected blood is not routinely stocked in most laboratories [ 59 ] . While potentially useful in the acute setting where an urgent diagnosis is needed, the RDTs cannot be used to monitor response to therapy as the malarial antigens persist up to 3 weeks in spite of successful treatment [ 61 ] . Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is increasingly being used as the \"gold standard\", being capable of detecting parasites below the threshold for microscopic identifi cation [ 62 ] . PCR is particularly advantageous in patients who have very low parasite levels, have taken chemoprophylaxis with consequent alteration in the morphology of the parasites, or in non-endemic settings where experience with direct microscopy is not as extensive. Other ancillary tests supporting a diagnosis of malaria include an elevated C-reactive protein, an elevated procalcitonin, thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, elevated liver function tests, and albuminuria [ 17 ] .",

Additional factors to consider in triaging children towards admission to a closely monitored or ICU setting include evidence of dehydration, inability to take or comply with oral medications requiring parenteral antimalarial treatment, or coexistence of malaria and sickle cell anemia [ 43 ] . In holo-endemic areas in particular, with high rates of asymptomatic malarial infections, coexisting or alternative illnesses causing a clinical picture suggestive of severe malarial anemia should be aggressively pursued. The most common differential diagnoses include meningoencephalitis, pneumonia, infectious or metabolic encephalopathy, other causes of severe anemia, and septic shock. In this epidemiological context, falciparum malaria is a diagnosis of exclusion, in which three negative blood smears at 8-12 h intervals are required before the diagnosis can be ruled out.

Artesunate treatment was shown to significantly reduce the risk of death from severe malaria compared to intravenous quinine: RR 0.76, 95 % CI 0.65-0.9. No difference was found in the risk of serious neurological sequelae at day 28. Artesunate therapy was also associated with a lower risk of hypoglycemia compared to quinine. Artesunate also has the advantage of not requiring rate controlled infusion or cardiac monitoring during administration and no need for dose modifi cation in renal failure [ 23 ] . Conversely, administration of parenteral quinine is fraught with the potential dangers of cardiac arrhythmias -cardiac telemetry is mandatory. If the QRS becomes prolonged more than 50 % its baseline value, or QTc > 600 msecs or >25 % baseline, the infusion should be stopped [ 23 ] . As mentioned above, quinine can also cause hypoglycemia through direct stimulation of insulin secretion. ",

Given that most cases of cerebral malaria in children are cared for in severely limited resource settings, there is scarce literature on using advanced therapies such as controlled mechanical ventilation, use of osmolar agents, or intracranial pressure monitoring. In a small study from Kenya [ 52 ] , mannitol was successful in transiently reducing intracranial pressure but no convincing clinical evidence emerged supporting its use.

Importantly, 57 % of the patients in this study had severe malaria. The investigators found that bolus fl uid resuscitation consisting of 20-40 mL/kg of either albumin or saline, as compared with controls -2-4 mL/kg/h maintenance fl uids (i.e. no fl uid bolus), increased the absolute risk of death at 48 h by 3.3 % and the risk of death, neurologic sequelae, or both at 4 weeks by 4 %. In the subgroup of children with severe malaria, fl uid resuscitation increased mortality as well -OR 1.59 (1.10-2.31). The trial included children with malaria, sepsis, pneumonia and meningitis, randomizing all children across treatment arms, even though recommendations for fl uid resuscitation are different among these conditions. The authors argue that in sub-Saharan Africa, where resources are very limited, positive diagnosis is not possible at the time of admission to the hospital, and a uniform approach has to be employed for treating severely ill children with very different clinical conditions that present in a similar manner. While the results of this study caution against liberal fl uid resuscitation where facilities for advanced diagnostics and monitoring are unavailable, their applicability is probably somewhat limited to those same settings. Conversely, at least for now, in more resource-rich settings, it seems reasonable to identify and treat hypovolemia and/or distributive shock according to the usual Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) guidelines and employ the usual parameters to guide treatment (restoration of peripheral perfusion and urine output, central venous pressure, artifi cial ventilation as necessary). In children presenting with coma, a more cautious approach to volume expansion should be employed [ 43 ] , maintaining the fi ne balance between risk of aggravating cerebral edema and the necessity of an adequate cerebral perfusion pressure.",

Dengue virus is transmitted from human to human by mosquito bites -the vector is the female Aedes mosquito, which, once infected, remains infective for life (30-45 days) . Man is the main reservoir of the virus [ 15 ] . Viremia in susceptible humans begins between 3 and 6 days after subcutaneous injection, lasts for another 3-6 days, and ends as the fever resolves [ 71 , 75 ] . Dengue can essentially be excluded as the cause of symptoms in a traveler who develops an illness more than 14 days after returning from a tropical or subtropical country [ 76 ] .

            "text": "All four dengue serotypes are capable of causing a clinical spectrum of illness ranging from undifferentiated febrile illness (dengue fever) to severe DHF/DSS, depending on the immune status and age of the host, primary vs. secondary infection, and an array of other putative factors. DHF/DSS occurs predominantly in children under the age of 16 years and is generally associated with secondary dengue infections [ 15 ] . Both the undifferentiated viral syndrome, seen in young children (from fi rst-time infection) and the classic dengue fever or \"breakbone fever\" seen in older children and adults (from secondary infections), are self-limited diseases that require minimal supportive therapy and have with excellent prognosis [ 15 ] . The focus of our discussion will therefore be severe dengue also known as DHF/DSS in the old classifi cation scheme (see further discussion below). The major pathophysiological processes that distinguish severe DHF from mild dengue are an abrupt onset of vascular leakage, with effusions, ascites and ensuing hypovolemic shock, accompanied by thrombocytopenia and a hemorrhagic diathesis [ 79 ] . The acute onset of hypovolemic shock -usually due to low plasma volume and less frequently due to hemorrhage -and the often dramatic clinical recovery with fl uid resuscitation, argue in favor of a transient functional increase in plasma vascular permeability that results in plasma leakage [ 15 ] . A characteristic feature of severe DHF is that it manifests clinically between days 4 and 6 of the illness, a time when the viremia is in steep decline and the host immune response is well established. The timing of these events suggests the host proinfl ammatory response, rather than direct virus-mediated effects, mediates the vascular permeability syndrome leading to DSS [ 80 ] . However, in spite of extensive research, little is known of the exact mechanisms underlying the change in vascular permeability. The prevailing view is that dengue infection triggers an immunopathogenic cascade that alters microvascular structure or function in some as yet undefi ned way, resulting in a transient, spontaneously-reversible increase in permeability [ 81 ] .",

Infection of endothelial cells by dengue virus has been studied in vitro but has resulted in confl icting fi ndings; the role of endothelial cells in dengue disease pathogenesis remains incompletely understood [ 87 ] . A postulated mechanism includes activation and apoptosis of human microvascular endothelial cells, with disruption of the inter-endothelial cell junctions [ 88 ] . Other studies have suggested a role for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [ 82 ] or alterations in \u03b2 integrin expression on the surface of the infected endothelium [ 89 ] . Another plausible pathophysiological mechanism for the increased vascular permeability characteristic of severe dengue is a transient disruption in the function of the endothelial gylcocalyx layer [ 69 ] . This layer covers the luminal surface of vascular endothelium throughout the body and is composed of a hydrated mesh, rich in carbohydrates and in dynamic equilibrium with plasma constituents. The endothelial glycocalyx has important roles in transduction of shear stress, regulation of leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions, regulation of clotting and complement cascade and it contributes to the permeability of the capillary wall [ 90 ] . Supporting the hypothesis of increased systemic permeability due to damaged glycocalyx is the observation that urinary clearance of albumin and other macromolecules is increased in children with active dengue infection [ 91 ] . In addition, both the virus itself and dengue non-structural protein (NS1) are known to adhere to heparan sulfate, a key structural element of the glycocalyx [ 69 ] , and increased urinary heparan sulfate excretion has been detected in children with severe infection [ 92 , 93 ] 9392.",

Self-limited muco-cutaneous hemorrhage is common, while overwhelming hemorrhage occurs less often. When it does occur, it can involve the gastrointestinal tract, skin, heart (pericardium), pleura, lungs or periadrenal tissue [ 94 ] . The pathogenesis of hemorrhage includes vascular changes, including capillary fragility (the basis of the tourniquet test), thrombocytopenia -due to both decreased marrow production and increased consumption, platelet dysfunction and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [ 95 ] , the latter usually in the setting of prolonged shock. While all these changes have been noted, they are seldom severe enough to cause the overwhelming hemorrhage that can occur in DHF [ 96 ] . An alternative explanation comes from studying the Ebola virus, another arbovirus belonging to the Filoviridae family. Recent work has demonstrated that Ebola virus produces a viral glycoprotein that infects endothelial cells and causes vascular cytotoxicity, leading to entothelial loss and vascular leak and hemorrhage [ 97 ] . Some authors speculate that this mechanism may be shared by other arboviruses causing viral hemorrhagic fevers, including dengue [ 96 ] . Others are circumspect, given the lack of direct evidence [ 98 , 99 ] .",

            "text": "Early in its course, dengue infection is often indistinguishable from other viral syndromes, parasitic infections, or bacterial sepsis. In addition, other conditions leading to a systemic infl ammatory response should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Laboratory methods for confi rming dengue vary depending on the stage of the illness. In the early stages -the fi rst 4-5 days of illness -diagnosis relies on detection of the virus, viral nucleic acid or viral antigens (especially non-structural antigen 1 -NS1) that can be detected within the fi rst 24 h to 5-7 days. These are called \"direct\" methods and although they provide an early and accurate diagnosis, they are not widely available in resource-limited countries. As the patient progresses into the critical/recovery phases, serology becomes the method of choice [ 68 ] -while serology is widely available, it is also less accurate. The antibody response varies according to the immune status of the host. A fi rst dengue infection in a person who has not been infected with or immunized against another Flavivirus (e.g. yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, etc.) leads to the appearance of specifi c IgM antibodies in the serum between day 5 and 10 of illness. These IgM antibodies disappear after 2-3 months. Anti-dengue serum IgG becomes detectable at the end of the fi rst week of illness, increasing slowly thereafter, with levels detectable for months and possibly longer. During a secondary dengue infection, or in a person previously infected with or immunized against another Flavivirus , antibody titers rise rapidly but cross-react with many viruses from the Flavivirus group. The predominant antibody type of secondary dengue infection is IgG, which rises as early as day 5 of illness and persists from months to life. Early IgM levels are much lower than in the primary infection and may even be undetectable [ 69 ] . Given these intricacies and the variable performance characteristics of commercially available ELISA tests, studies have shown that combining a direct method such as NS1 detection (day 1 to 7-9) with a serologic method such as IgM/IgG detection (after day 4-5) allows for dengue diagnosis throughout the normal temporal spectrum of patient presentation [ 112 ] (Table 37 .9 ).",

While the pathophysiology of the two shock states may be different, it is important to note that in western countries mechanical ventilation is easily accessible if patients develop signs and symptoms of fl uid overload and respiratory compromise. However in countries where dengue is endemic, respiratory compromise secondary to fl uid overload is a major contributor to mortality in settings with poor resources, few personnel, and limited equipment [ 115 ] . It is thus incumbent upon critical care physicians to adjust their practice to the appropriate setting and keep parenteral fl uid therapy to the minimum required to maintain cardiovascular stability, until plasma leakage ceases [ 69 ] . Patients with severe dengue shock, especially if presenting late in the course, should also receive supportive care as clinically indicated, to include renal replacement therapy, use of inotropes and vasopressors, management of liver failure or encephalopathy.",

In order to produce disease in healthy individuals, the infectious dose has to be large, between 1,000 and one million organisms in volunteers. The infectious dose is decreased in the presence of the capsular Vi antigen, decreased stomach acidity, and food (which protects the bacterium) [ 121 ] . Once in the small intestine, the organisms penetrate the mucosa -likely through the specialized epithelial M cells -and are taken up by the macrophages resident in the submucosa and travel to the local lymph nodes [ 122 ] . In contrast to the non-typhoidal Salmonella serotypes resulting in gastroenteritis, which cause a signifi cant neutrophil infl ux in the intestinal mucosa and localized infection, the typhoidal Salmonella evade this local defense mechanism. Recent evidence suggests that typhoidal strains evade pattern recognition receptors and induce a less vigorous infl ammatory response [ 123 ] . A short bacteremic phase ensues, which carries the Salmonella to the reticuloendothelial system of the liver and spleen, where massive multiplication of the organisms occurs. The incubation period lasts 7-14 days, followed by a severe secondary bacteremia which marks the onset of clinical illness [ 122 ] . During this phase, virtually all organs can be invaded, but of particular importance are the infection of the Peyer's patches and the gallbladder. The Peyer's patches become hyperplastic, with superfi cial necrosis that leads to superfi cial ovoid ulcers, a hallmark of typhoid fever. Located along the longitudinal axis of the gut, these do not heal with stricture formation, however when such an ulcer erodes into a mural vessel, severe hemorrhage and/or perforation leading to peritonitis can occur [ 122 ] . Infection of the gallbladder can result in a chronic, subclinical cholecystitis with persistent fecal carriage.",

Paratyphoid fever has a shorter incubation period and has a similar, sometimes milder clinical course [ 122 ] . The classic description of the untreated typhoid fever of average severity is a protracted illness spanning about 4 weeks. The fi rst week is characterized by non-specifi c, fl u-like symptoms, a \"coated\" tongue, intermittent or low grade fevers, constipation in adults, diarrhea in children or HIV positive adults [ 124 ] . During the second week, the overall condition of the patient declines, with sustained high fevers and a characteristic \"relative bradycardia.\" Patients appear systemically ill with abdominal distention and splenomegaly. In about 30-50 % of cases \"rose spots\" appear -these are pink, maculopapular lesions, 2-4 mm in diameter that develop in crops over the upper abdomen and lower thorax. These are not specifi c for typhoid, as they may also occur in invasive non-typhoidal salmonellosis and shigellosis [ 122 ] . They may be diffi cult to see in dark skinned individuals and may also be diffi cult to differentiate from other bacterial or viral exanthems. During the third week, the overall condition of the patient declines further, with continuous sustained high fever, neuropsychiatric manifestations, worsened abdominal distention, and diarrhea. Signifi cant complications occur in about 10-15 % of patients and include overwhelming septic shock, myocarditis, intestinal perforation or hemorrhage, and typhoid encephalopathy. Gastro-intestinal bleeding is the most frequent complication and is usually mild, however in about 2 % of cases the bleeding can be life threatening. Intestinal perforation is the most serious complication, occurring in about 2 % of cases and it doesn't always present with an acute abdomen but rather in a more subtle manner, with worsening abdominal pain, tachycardia and altered mental status. Encephalopathy and shock carry a high mortality [ 121 ] . Neuropsychiatric symptoms include apathy, severe agitation, and delirium, although deep coma is unusual. For unclear reasons, the incidence of encephalopathy varies by country, from 10 to 40 % of patients in Indonesia [ 125 ] to less than 2 % of patients in Vietnam [ 126 ] . Patients who survive into the fourth week start to improve, defervesce, abdominal distention also improves slowly, although the danger of perforation and hemorrhage persists well into the fourth week. Variations from this classic picture are often seen and with the widespread use of antibiotics, the clinical course is much shorter. In fact, community-based studies in areas of endemic disease indicate that many patients, especially children less than 5 years of age, may have a non-specifi c febrile illness that is not recognized clinically as typhoid [ 124 ] .",

The clinical diagnosis can be diffi cult depending on the timing of presentation relative to the natural history of the clinical disease. The gold standard confi rmatory test is a blood culture -however the sensitivity of a blood culture can be as low as 40-80 % early in the disease when bacteremia is highest and even lower later in the clinical course [ 128 ] . Stool and urine cultures become positive after the fi rst week. However, sensitivity for stool and urine cultures is also low. Bone marrow culture is quite sensitive (55-67 %), though bone marrow aspiration is invasive and impractical in many cases. Multiple serologic tests are as widely used as microbiologic culture, but also with problematic performance. The Widal test is the classic test and is based on detecting antibodies to the O and H antigens of S. typhi . Other tests such as the Typhidot or Tubex tests directly detect IgM antibodies to multiple S. typhi antigens. These tests have also underperformed and overall show roughly a 70-90 % sensitivity and 70-90 % specifi city. Despite their limitations they still are used clinically. Nested polymerase chain reaction is exquisitely sensitive and specifi c and remains promising as the next gold standard for diagnosis where laboratory resources are available. In the end, diagnosis of Typhoid is made largely on a clinical basis. Other common laboratory abnormalities are mild and nonspecifi c including leukopenia and thrombocytopenia in adults, whereas leukocytosis frequently occurs in children. Hepatic enzymes may also be mildly elevated [ 128 , 129 ] .",

Drug choices should be made based on the severity of illness, geographic resistance patterns, or laboratory sensitivities from clinical isolates. Historically, treatment with amoxicillin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was the standard of care for many years. Unfortunately, resistance to these agents has become very common. In some areas of China and India 50-80 % of isolates are multidrug resistant [ 119 ] . Fluoroquinolones have been an excellent alternative supported by multiple clinical trials. Unfortunately in many areas of central and South East Asia, decreased susceptibility to fl uoroquinolones is as high as 75-80 % in Tajikistan and Vietnam in the late 1990s [ 119 ] . Many prospective trials have also demonstrated signifi cant success with azithromycin and ceftriaxone, and treatment with these agents is becoming more widespread. Unfortunately, recently extendedspectrum beta-lactamases have been identifi ed in typhoidal Salmonella serotypes that will greatly limit the therapeutic options for this widespread tropical disease [ 130 ] . At this point, for invasive infections fl uoroquinolones or third generation cephalosporins are recommended empirically until sensitivities are available [ 121 , 129 , 130 ] . Table 37 .10 contains some treatment options for resistant serotypes although in the case of quinolone resistance, multidrug regimens are being studied but data is lacking at this point [ 128 , 131 ] . Other adjunctive therapy includes dexamethasone has been Unclear effectiveness however treatment for quinolone resistance is not well defi ned used as an adjunctive therapy for severe disease characterized by shock and obtundation/coma. Reportedly, the use of dexamethasone reduced mortality in a severe cohort from 35-55 to 10 % [ 125 , 132 , 133 ]. Some reports have described different clinical features in multidrug resistant typhoid fever (MDRTF) and rising overall mortality up to 16 % in this cohort. These patients are more toxic in appearance, with a higher fever (up to 40 \u00b0C in some cases), more frequent (and more severe) abdominal distention and tenderness, and hepatomegaly and splenomegaly [ 134 ] . Several hypotheses have been suggested to explain this including delay in starting effective antibiotics, high bacterial load, and possibly higher microbial virulence.",

The annual incidence of leptospirosis in tropical endemic areas is 10-100/100,000 people whereas it is 0.1-1/100,000 people in temperate areas [ 135 ] . In the end there are more than 500,000 cases of leptospirosis reported per year with an overall mortality rate of 10 % [ 136 ] . Although leptospirosis is seen in tropical, subtropical, and temperate climates, it is endemic in much of the tropics, especially in South East Asia. The incidence of the disease is associated with the lack of proper sanitation, poor water quality, fl ooding, and the presence of maintenance hosts such as rats, dogs, cattle, and swine who excrete leptospira in the urine [ 137 ] . Infected rats shed the pathogen for life and most other animals shed for 6-12 months, thereby preventing pathogen eradication from the soil and water. In the past two decades the epidemiology of this disease is changing to include more poor urban settings, especially those with high rainfall and fl ooding. In addition, there have been multiple, limited outbreaks in nonendemic areas such as the USA, Canada, and continental Europe [ 138 ] . Many of these outbreaks were related to recreational contact with contaminated natural settings [ 137 , 138 ] . The disease is contracted via contact with contaminated water or soil, as well as direct contact with infected animal urine. As such, the risk (and incidence) of leptospirosis is increased in many occupations, including farmers, butchers, and veterinarians because of direct contact with hosts. Also, sewer workers, construction workers, fl ood relief workers, and military personnel are at risk due to indirect contact with contaminated waters. In addition, recreational activities resulting in exposure to contaminated fresh water bodies (lakes, streams, ponds) are at risk for contracting the disease [ 139 ] . With increased incidence in endemic areas as well as nonendemic areas, leptospirosis is now considered an emerging global disease [ 137 ] .",

They invade tissues by adhering to a wide range of extracellular matrix components, endothelial cells, leukocytes, and kidney epithelial cells thereby gaining access to the bloodstream [ 136 , 138 ] . Once the pathogen has invaded the entry point such as the conjunctiva, there is rapid penetration and dissemination of the organism throughout the body and particularly the kidney [ 141 ] . An early fi nding of diffuse endothelial injury or vasculitis is the main mechanism of tissue damage [ 142 ] . Although the exact cause of the vascular infl ammation is not yet understood, there are many data showing evidence of small vessel disease in the lung and kidney, as well as the aorta, coronary arteries, and cerebral vessels. Other mechanisms of injury in addition to direct endothelial injury are parenchymal cell injury and increased vascular permeability [ 142 ] . Whether the vasculitis demonstrated in leptospirosis is of an autoimmune nature is controversial. Many of the features of common vasculitides such as immune complex deposition have not been shown in leptospirosis, leading some to maintain that the endothelial activation/injury is sepsis-like rather than autoimmune mediated [ 142 , 143 ] .",

Other clinicians report benefi t from antibiotics started later in the course of illness [ 150 ] . Unfortunately given the nonspecifi c signs and symptoms and minimal laboratory diagnostic options, the diagnosis is often made as the disease is beginning to resolve. The antibiotics typically used are penicillin for severe disease and doxycycline for milder disease. Cephalosporins and macrolides can also be used. The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction can occur shortly after starting any bacteriocidal antibiotic treatment of a spirochete. Typically it occurs within 1-2 h and is characterized by fever, tachycardia, rigors, and hypotension [ 139 ] . Because of the autoimmune-like fi ndings, steroids have been tried in severe disease. The data remain confl icting and controversial.",

Quinidine commonly causes hypotension and concentration-dependent prolongation of ventricular repolarization (QT prolongation). Quinidine is thus considered more toxic than quinine and should only be used if no other effective parenteral drugs are available. Parenteral chloroquine is no longer recommended for the treatment of severe malaria, because of widespread resistance. Intramuscular sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is also not recommended[ 44 ]. Parenteral antimalarials should be administered for a minimum of 24 h, once started (irrespective of the patient's ability to tolerate oral medication earlier), and, thereafter, a 7 day treatment course should be completed with the enteral combinations listed inTable 37.5 as described by the WHO[ 44 , 45 ]. Treatment should be monitored closely. Along with clinical improvement, parasite clearance should also be demonstrated by following daily parasite counts. In the fi rst 24-36 h of therapy, it is possible for the parasite count to rise and this does not indicate failure of therapy[ 23 ]. However if the counts do not start to fall by 48 h and/or do not clear by day 7, resistance to the chosen course of chemotherapy is likely.",
