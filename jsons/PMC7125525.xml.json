            "text": "Although the innate immune system functions in all tissues and organs, its role is especially prominent in those areas that are highly exposed to the external environment: the skin, digestive and genitourinary tracts, and airways. Not only are these regions of the body precisely those that are most vulnerable to attack by bioterrorist weapons, but they are also relatively accessible for potential interventions. Innate immune defenses are based on both the cells permanently located within tissues and on the migration of additional cells to the site of infection as needed. The innate immune system cellular network includes Langerhans cells of the skin, tissue dendritic cells and macrophages, and tissue-associated lymphocytes, such as natural killer (NK) cells and \u03b3\u03b4 receptor T cells, which trigger these early responses to infection. Furthermore, many epithelial cells can sense and take action against microbes, including by means of secretion of antimicrobial peptides that directly act on the invaders, as well as upregulation of cytokines and chemokines that call additional cells into action, including signaling T and B cells that an infection is present. The key to rapid innate responses is the expression of highly specialized receptors, including the family of toll-like receptors (TLRs), which trigger cellular activation to molecules that constitute recurrent patterns of microbial structures. These targets include LPS, teichoic acid, flagellin, cell-wall lipoproteins, highly mannosylated polymers, and nucleic acids.17 Furthermore, the immediate defensive steps triggered by innate immune activation also attack targets widespread among pathogens: antimicrobial peptide formation of pores in bacterial cell walls, IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 action against viral replication, and activation of the alternate complement pathway.18\n",

Immature dendritic cells activated through their TLRs undergo a maturation process that includes migration to the local lymph node, expression of costimulatory molecules needed for lymphocyte activation, and processing and presentation of engulfed antigens (ie, protein antigens in the context of MHC class I and class II molecules and lipid materials by CD1 proteins). Thus innate immunity sounds the alarm that infection has occurred, summons defenses, and initiates antigen-specific T- and B-cell responses. For many years, adjuvants have been used to enhance vaccination responses by a process now beginning to be understood as the innate immune triggering of adaptive immunity. The question is whether the early, broad, and more generic responses of the innate immune system can be rationally harnessed to protect before or after exposure to a variety of potential bioterrorist agents.",

Protective effects correlated in some cases with the release of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12,12 but overall, the precise mechanisms of protection are not well understood.",

For example, synthetic immunostimulants that signal through TLR4 induced protective responses in mice against the influenza virus and Listeria species.13 In a natural infection many distinct innate immune receptors contribute together to the innate immune response.20, 21, 22 Current data indicate that stimulation of multiple TLR receptors leads to synergistic cytokine production.23 This variety of signaling might lead to a highly effective protection that would be beneficial to mimic with immunotherapeutic approaches; one method might be to test the combination of differently targeted agonists, such as using TLR4 and TLR9 ligands together to more closely mimic the innate immune responses observed in natural infections. Therefore innate immune stimulation strategies have the potential to tap into complex and effective responses by using rationally designed molecules. Whether innate immune stimulation strategies would be effective depends on a number of factors: How do microbes activate innate immunity, and can that be effectively mimicked? Will innate immune defenses elicited by pure compounds elicit the full range of innate immune defenses? Will pathogen immune system evasion strategies negate attempts to use this approach? Will heterogeneity in health, age, and genes for innate immune system function in the human population prevent the use of innate immune system stimulation approaches?",

            "text": "Antimicrobial compounds, produced both constitutively and in response to specific microbial activation, function both extracellularly and within phagosomes to destroy bacteria. Antimicrobial peptides can be present in high concentrations locally and destroy many bacteria by mechanisms distinct from those of antibiotics in current use.26 Reactive oxygen and nitrogen radicals constitute major lethal defenses against intracellular bacteria. Bacteria coated with innate immune surfactants or mannose-binding protein, often including complement activated by the alternate (innate immune) pathway, are opsonized and more readily phagocytosed. It seems reasonable that at least the extracellular mediators of the innate immune system, such as innate opsonins, complement components, and certain antimicrobial peptides, could be effective antibacterial agents. For example, antimicrobial peptides have shown positive clinical results and can be synthetically modified to reduce toxicity to human cells while maintaining antibacterial activity.27 With over 700 antimicrobial peptides from various species listed in a central database (http://www.bbcm.univ.trieste.it/~tossi/pag1.html), development of certain peptides into broad-spectrum treatments that would be at least partially effective against unknown or poorly defined bioterrorist agents seems possible and highly attractive. The question of selection of bacteria resistant to antimicrobial peptides needs to be taken into account. Multiple mechanisms of resistance to microbial peptides are known, including constitutive insensitivity and inducible modifications of the bacterial cell (reviewed in Yeaman and Yount28). For example, a virulence factor of Staphylococcus aureus, the action of which is to modify membrane lipids with l-lysine, was shown to contribute to resistance to antimicrobial peptide killing.29 Biodefense strategies on the basis of only a few compounds, unlike the natural situation that entails an array of local and systemic responses, raises the question of whether widespread use of such drugs might select resistant variants.",

The outer membrane protein Omp25 of Brucella suis inhibits TNF-\u03b1, a major innate and adaptive immune cytokine that combats B suis infection.32\nBordetella pertussis possesses at least 6 known virulence factors the major effects of which are on macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils, including the inhibition of cytokine release, oxidative responses, intracellular killing, chemotaxis, and phagocytic function.33 Thus pathogenic bacteria possess multiple and highly effective means of counteracting innate immune activation and defensive functions. Indeed, certain bacteria might even take advantage of the local inflammation and cellular activation induced by innate responses to further their own survival and spread. For example, innate immune induction of TNF expression in human alveolar macrophages stimulates the intracellular replication of virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis, even though overall the cytokine appears to have a protective effect.34\n",

            "text": "Innate immune system activation by microbial products or adjuvants has been implicated in inflammatory processes that might be associated with pathologic responses of the adaptive immune system to self-proteins. T and B cells reactive to self-proteins are believed to be present in every individual but do not cause disease because they generally are not activated. T and B cells with autoimmune disease potential probably rarely encounter self-antigens presented in the context of costimulatory molecules, and their activity is controlled by peripheral immune tolerance, which includes active control by regulatory T cells.66 However, in an autoimmune-prone mouse model of systemic lupus erythematosus, stimulation of B cells with receptors for self-immunoglobulin through TLR9 was sufficient to activate them to produce autoantibodies.67 More generally, immature dendritic cells have the ability to take up materials from their environment but do not enter lymph nodes or express MHC class II or costimulatory molecules. But when signaled through innate immune receptors, dendritic cells trigger a maturation process that results in a shift from antigen uptake to antigen presentation, with the dendritic cells migrating to lymph nodes and expressing costimulatory molecules and cytokines. A potential consequence of this enhanced level of stimulation is that self-antigens might be presented in the context of costimulatory molecules or a costimulatory cytokine environment. In this regard recent important studies have shown that normal immune regulation is susceptible to being overridden by innate immune stimulation. Activation of antigen-presenting cells by means of TLR stimulation stimulates IL-6 release, which temporarily inactivates CD4+, CD25+ T cells that ordinarily would dampen immune responses.68 Although this process is thought to be part of the normal role of innate immunity that permits the establishment of effective adaptive immune responses, as would typically occur in vaccination or active infection, the overriding function of innate immunity might also contribute to innate immune-mediated damage or contribute to autoimmune disease activation. Certain individuals are prone to autoimmune diseases and whether they might experience increased risks from the use of innate immune activation requires analysis.",

The molecule suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 is induced by LPS and CpG treatment and acts on the intracellular signaling pathways of TLR4 and TLR9 to negatively regulate their activating functions.69, 70 The macrophage- and monocyte-expressed molecule IRAK-M prevents the dissociation of signaling kinases from TLRs, thereby effectively blocking TLR signaling.71 Another protein, tollip, associates directly with TLR2 and TLR4 and inhibits signaling by blocking phosphorylation of other associated signaling molecules.72, 73 Additionally, an alternate and shortened form of the TLR signaling adaptor molecule MyD88 with inhibitory function arises after continuous innate immune stimulation, resulting in a transcriptionally controlled negative regulation of innate immune responses.74 These molecules and additional mechanisms control responses to innate receptor activation and also contribute to the temporary tolerance of innate immune responses that appears to result from exposure to potent stimulants.75 However, as demonstrated by Aderem et al, macrophages exhibit a sustained and continued activation during exposure to TLR agonists, although this is accompanied by a downmodulation of receptors76 that makes the sustained response different from the initial response.77\n",

Continuous innate immune inflammatory stimulation must be avoided to coexist with normal microbial flora in the gastrointestinal tract. This accommodation might reflect at least in part that human intestinal epithelial cells are generally nonresponsive to bacterial ligands that stimulate TLR2.7 Nevertheless, it is clear that innate immune responses to bacterial components in intestinal tissues are required for normal function, as evidenced by the association of Crohn's disease with a loss of function mutation in the molecule NOD2.78, 79 The presence of T cells with highly similar \u03b3\u03b4 receptors situated throughout the lining of the gut might serve a counterinflammatory function to contribute to the establishment and maintenance of normal flora.80 Any approaches designed to induce heightened innate immunity in the gut or other mucosal tissues will need to take into account the tolerance state involving normal flora and analyze the effect of the proposed strategy. Moreover, innate immune stimulation induced by treatment strategies must remain under the body's regulatory controls to avoid potential runaway responses that could lead to systemic shock. Potentially, along with the development of innate immune stimulants, there should also be measures available to counter innate inflammatory responses. It might be possible to develop potential controllers on the basis of innate immune receptors that are known. For example, inhibitory-suppressive motifs are known for DNA structures that can act dominantly over CpG stimulation, providing a potential antidote if immunostimulation by CpG sequences dangerously overresponded.81, 82\n",
