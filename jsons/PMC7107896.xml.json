A coronavirus has been identified as the cause of the disease [3]. High fever, dry cough, headache, malaise, and dyspnea are associated with SARS onset. A chest radiograph shows infiltrates and widespread consolidation in severe cases. Approximately 20% of patients with SARS develop acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the disease may progress, with pulmonary fibrosis. No specific treatment has been available, although antiviral drugs (e.g., ribavirin) and high doses of glucocorticoids have been given. Measures have also been taken to support vital functions. Treatment with supplemental oxygen and noninvasive ventilation (continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] or bilevel positive airway pressure [BiPAP] via a face mask) is regularly provided, and in most severe cases, tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation is performed.",

The improvement of arterial oxygenation by inhaled NO treatment was as good as or better than that seen in previous reports on acute respiratory distress syndrome [4, 5]. The ratio of PaO2 to FIO2 more than doubled after initiation of inhaled NO treatment. Moreover, the possibility of eliminating the use of pressure support during NO inhalation without a decrease in SpO2 may reduce the risk for lung damage. Several patients had emphysematous bullae or a pneumothorax, indicating lung tissue damage by the disease, or hyperinflation damage caused by the ventilator treatment. Avoidance of CPAP and BiPAP may also reduce the risk of exposing the nursing staff to the SARS coronavirus. It has even been recommended that noninvasive ventilation be discontinued in the treatment of patients with SARS in some hospitals.",

This can hardly be explained by the vasorelaxant properties of inhaled NO. NO is also a potent antimicrobial agent and exerts an inhibitory effect on several viruses [8, 9]. A recent study on clinical isolates of coronavirus showed that glycyrrhizin (from the liquorice root) inhibited the replication of the SARS-associated virus [10]. This effect was presumably mediated via NO release [11]. We have recently shown that the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine greatly increased the survival rate of SARS coronavirus-infected Vero E6 cells [12]. It is thus tempting to attribute our results to inhaled NO treatment. However, the number of patients we treated was small. Readers therefore need to be cautious when interpreting our results.",
