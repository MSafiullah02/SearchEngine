No mother-child contact or breastfeeding occurred in the 3 newborn babies. Time between birth and diagnosis was limited, ranging between 30 h and 5 days. Taken together, the chance of infection through ways other than intrauterine transmission is deemed to be low. However, there are other explanations for neonate infections. First, possibility of nosocomial infection cannot be completely ruled out. Second, nasopharyngeal and annals swabs cannot directly indicate intrauterine infection, and no viral particles were found in amniotic fluid or cord blood from 6 patients [9]. Third, number of neonatal infections is small although incomplete identification is possible. Fourth, SARS-CoV, another coronavirus with similar genome sequence [12], was not found to be vertically transmitted [13, 14]. Further research is warranted.",
