            "text": "Hyperoxia is often required to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a common complication of severe diseases of various systems. However, hyperoxia can also cause severe lung toxicity. This toxicity may be induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS), although the molecular mechanism is not fully understood.1 Metabolite levels of ROS are easily cleared by antioxidants including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidases or low-molecular-weight vitamins,2 but high levels of ROS can damage cellular machinery via several mechanisms including lipid peroxidation,3 enzyme consumption and ultimately DNA damage. Direct cytotoxicity is a major threat to both lung epithelial and endothelial cells, while DNA lesions can also have detrimental consequences due to genotoxicity or mutagenicity.4 Although chromosomal damage was indicated in hyperoxia samples a few decades ago,1 our lab is the first to directly demonstrate that hyperoxia causes lung cell DNA-strand breaks.5 Alveolar epithelial type I cells are thought to be the primary target of hyperoxic damage;6, 7, 8 however, latest evidence also reveals that hyperoxia induces DNA damage in alveolar epithelial type II cells (AECII).9 Thus, DNA repair of epithelial cells is critical to the integrity of lung structure and function.",

The large parts of these nonbulky adducts are repaired by the base excision repair (BER) mechanism,5, 10 with possible participation from nuclear excision repair.11 DNA glycosylases, of which there are several types, recognize damaged DNA bases and catalyze hydrolytic cleavage of the N-glycosyl bond linking the base to the sugar. A DNA polymerase then fills the resulting gap. Several glycosylases have been identified with the ability to remove oxidative base damage, including thymine glycol DNA glycosylase, hydroxymethyl uracil glycosylase, and 8-oxo-dG DNA glycosylase.12 The latter function is exerted by the human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (hOgg1), whose specificity for 8-oxo-dG is when formed in situ in DNA and hence paired opposite C. In Escherichia coli, formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg), a functional homologue of Ogg1 removes the 8-oxo-dG.13 A second 8-oxodG glycosylase, namely hOgg2, has a specificity for 8-oxo-dG when derived from the nucleotide pool and misincorporated opposite G or A.14",

Recently, the MAP kinase pathways have been linked to hyperoxic toxicity in both cell cultures and animal models;24, 25 hyperoxia primarily activates ERK1/2 but less so p38.25 Buckley et al. have demonstrated that increased ERK1/2 may correlate with protection against hyperoxic toxicity in rats.24, 26, 27 p38 MAPK is linked to mismatch repair DNA response via the G2 checkpoint and to resistance to chemotherapeutic DNA-methylating agents.28 The only study relating BER to cell cycle regulators demonstrates the link of long-patch BER to p21 in mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line.29 It is unclear whether BER pathway is linked to MAPK under hyperoxia. We explored the possibility that MAPK are involved in BER pathway in response to hyperoxic toxicity. Despite carcinoma originality, A549 cells have been widely used as type II-like cells for mechanistic studies of alveolar epithelial physiological properties and signaling pathways.30, 31 By transducing stable expression of hOgg1 in alveolar epithelial A549 cells with a retroviral vector as described previously,32 we report here that overexpression of BER DNA repair proteins can afford protection against hyperoxic toxicity. Further, the protective role of BER against hyperoxia appeared to involve an upregulation of ERK1/2 and downregulation of p38. Primary rat type II cells are also used to confirm the role of BER in hyperoxia.",

A549 cells have been widely used as type II-like cells for mechanistic studies of alveolar epithelial physiological properties and signaling pathways.30, 31 DNA single-strand breaks by hyperoxia were identified using the comet assay of A549 cells based on alkaline electrophoresis (Figure 1b). This result indicates that hyperoxic treatment increased DNA damage compared to the control. After exposure to hyperoxia for 2 days, the average of tail lengths for 75 control cells was 1.2\u00b10.21 arbitrary units (\u03bcm), while 14.8\u00b11.7 \u03bcm in oxygen-treated cells (P<0.01). To further identify the particular DNA adduct, we detected 8-oxo-dG and found a three-fold increase in 8-oxo-dG by 2-day hyperoxic exposure using HPLC-ECD (Figure 1c). This increase in 8-oxo-dG was further confirmed in nuclear extracts using Western blotting approach by monoclonal antibodies against 8-oxo-dG (Trevigen, Figure 1d). While the nuclear extracts were evenly loaded by reprobing with GAPDH and BCA assay, the increase of 8-oxo-dG is approximately three- to four-fold compared with the control. Western blotting using antibodies demonstrates compatible results to the HPLC-ECD method, but is more conveniently performed. The production of DNA 8-oxo-dG adduct is dependent on the hyperoxic intensity and the exposure time (peaked at 48 h).",

The cells initially expressed about 40% EGFP but expressed >99% EGFP after two cycles of FACS sorting and colony selection. In addition, the selected cell clones expressed high levels of hOgg1, but to varying quantities in different clones. As shown in Figure 2a, clone 2 is a representative of total 35 clones overexpressing EGFP. Expression of hOgg1 was demonstrated by Western blotting detection in seven representatives of total 35 clones (Figure 2b). Overexpression of hOgg1 was also demonstrated by Northern, RT-PCR and enzymatic activity as shown previously.5 Colony forming units (CFU) and MTT assays (48 h) were performed to determine whether cells could survive and resume proliferation following exposure to hyperoxia.5 As expected, overexpression of hOgg1 in A549 clones alleviated the toxicity of hyperoxia versus the control.5 Primary AECII cells were also transfected with hOgg1 using liposome reagent; transfection efficiency was approximately 32% but neomycin selection achieved approximately 81% positivity of hOgg1 expression determined by cytochemistry. Cell lysates were assayed for hOgg1 expression by enzymatic cleavage assay (Figure 2c) and Western blotting (Figure 2d). For activity assay, number 2\u20136 were different transfection populations and all showed significant hOgg1 expression. More importantly, overexpression of hOgg1 attenuated the hyperoxic toxicity in AECII cells against the vector controls as evidenced by reduced DNA strand breaks using a comet assay (Figure 2e). After exposure to hyperoxia for 2 days, the average of tail lengths in 75 cells overexpressing hOgg1 was 2.75\u00b10.2 \u03bcm (arbitrary), while 19.5\u00b12.3 \u03bcm in control cells (P<0.01).",

In this study, cells expressing hOgg1 or vector control were exposed to room air or hyperoxia for 36 h. Phosphorylated p38 was quantitatively measured using phospho-ATF-2 Thr71 antibody in A549 cells after immunoprecipitation with immobilized phospho-p38 antibodies (Thr180/Tyr182). The results show that hyperoxia induces a seven-fold increase in p38 activity (determined by densitometry) compared to the control by hyperoxic exposure (Figure 3a). We then examined whether p38 is altered by enhanced expression of BER DNA repair proteins. The results suggest that overexpression of hOgg1 in A549 cells significantly decreases p38 activity under oxygen treatment (p38 activity was only half of those cells without transduction or vector transduction as determined by densitometry, P<0.05) (Figure 3b).",

The results demonstrate that p38 inhibitor specifically reduced p38 kinase activity (Figure 3c). We then examined whether SB202190 and hOgg1 can have added effect on decrease in p38 activity, our data indicate an apparent synergistic effect between hOgg1 and SB202190. To further assess whether the MAPK is specifically upregulated by hyperoxia, we have used several dominant-negative constructs to transfect the lung cells. An example is the transfection of p38 dominant-negative mutant (p38\u03b1FA) using liposome Gene-Porter, we have demonstrated a downregulation of p38 activity, resulting in a reduced effect of hyperoxia-stimulated p38 kinase activity (Figure 3d). Transfection efficiency with the dominant constructs was approximately 37%, but neomycin selection achieved over 83% cells expressing the inserted constructs by immunohistochemistry (not shown). Importantly, introduction of dominant-negative mutation (p38\u03b1AF) resulted in reduction of apoptosis in A549 cells under hyperoxic exposure for 48 h (Figure 3e). The result show that the mitochondrial component staining (CMXRos MitoTracker) appeared in the nuclear compartment along with the Annexin-V staining (apoptotic cells), but no Annexin-V staining in the cell expressing p38\u03b1AF. The apoptotic cells were enumerated and transfection with p38\u03b1AF construct resulted in less apoptosis compared to the vector control (P<0.05). Similarly, we transfected freshly isolated AECII with p38\u03b1AF construct, which demonstrates significant protection against hyperoxia compared to the vector control in the primary isolation (Figure 3f). The introduction of p38\u03b1AF dominant-negative mutant also reduced the p38 activity compared with the vector control as determined by Western blotting (not shown).",

Using ERK1/2 kinase assay, we demonstrate that ERK1/2 activity was increased by two-fold following hyperoxic treatment of A549 cells (Figure 4a). AECII cells were isolated and identified by tannic acid staining, cytokeratin 18 and surfactant protein-C immunostaining, and hyperoxia induced approximately two- (48 h) to three-fold (24 h) upregulation in ERK1/2 in primary AECII cells (Figure 4b). The data suggest an upregulation of ERK1/2 pathway in both alveolar cell line A549 and primary alveolar cells under a natural response to hyperoxia. Comparing ERK1/2 activity between A549 and AECII cells, the results demonstrate that there was more significant increase of ERK1/2 in A549 cells than that in AECII cells.",

Levels of hOgg1 overexpression were compared in transduced A549 and AECII cells, and the results suggest that A549 cells expressed approximately two-fold hOgg1 than that of AECII cells. We also show that overexpression of hOgg1 markedly induced the activation of ERK1/2 (15-fold against the control, Figure 4c). Protein loading was controlled using Bio-Rad or BCA protein assay and also normalized by total ERK1/2 proteins. Furthermore, A549 cells overexpressing hOgg1 were associated with decreased hyperoxic toxicity and increased cell survival against vector control cells as determined by a trypan blue exclusion assay (P<0.05, Figure 4f). We also confirmed the results using the MTT assay showing that proliferation was increased by hOgg1 (not shown). This is consistent with a previous study that demonstrated the protective role of ERK1/2 against hyperoxia.26 To further confirm the above observations, we used the ERK inhibitor PD98059 to test hyperoxic regulation of ERK1/2 activity. The addition of the chemical inhibitor resulted in significant reduction of ERK1/2 activity in comparison with the controls upon oxygen exposure (Figure 4e). However, reduction of ERK1/2 by PD98059 inhibitor significantly increased hyperoxic toxicity and decreased cell survival against control cells as determined by a trypan blue exclusion assay (P<0.05, Figure 4f).

            "text": "Whether or not hyperoxia causes significant apoptosis is a controversial topic. Until very recently, there was no report to demonstrate caspase-mediated apoptosis in animals by hyperoxia.45 Apoptosis was identified by Vybrant Apoptosis Assay (Molecular Probes), which showed that the apoptosis was reduced by overexpression of hOgg1 (green dye staining apoptotic cells, while red dye staining necrotic cells, Figure 5a). Control A549 cells expressing vector had 40% apoptotic cells (green color), while transduced cells expressing hOgg1 had virtually no apoptosis (<5%, similar to room air control) by quantitative assessment (Figure 5b). Our data indicate that overexpression of hOgg1 in A549 cells reduced hyperoxic apoptosis compared with the vector control. hOgg1 may interact with cell survival signaling pathways to reduce hyperoxia-induced apoptosis. To ascertain the results, apoptosis was determined by Death ELISA assay to measure the nucleosomal DNA fragments and the results showed that overexpression of hOgg1 significantly reduced apoptosis from hyperoxic exposure (Figure 5c). Other assays such as TUNEL and DNA laddering also demonstrate the similar results (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate the protection role of hOgg1 in lung epithelial cells through attenuating apoptosis, and support our hypothesis that hyperoxia regulates both MAPK and hOgg1.",

We assessed whether hyperoxia can increase levels of p53 or p21. Despite not being a lung cell line, p21 deficient cell lines (HCT116 p21\u2212/\u2212) cells are well-established model of p21 knockout that does not need to further establish and characterize the p21 deficiency.33 We detected significantly reduced levels of ERK1/2 (half of the control) in HCT116 p21\u2212/\u2212 cells compared with the parental HCT116 cells when exposed to hyperoxia (36 h), suggesting that HCT116 p21\u2212/\u2212 cells were particularly sensitive to hyperoxic toxicity, consistent with previous reports.19 For the gel, consistent loading of samples was ensured by BCA protein assay (Figure 6a). In addition, we have found that hyperoxia induced cell cycle arrest, but hOgg1 expression reduced this arrest by flow cytometry (not shown). We then studied p53 and p21 activation in A549 cells in hyperoxia using semiquantitative RT-PCR. The results demonstrate that transcripts of p21 were markedly upregulated by hyperoxia (Figure 6b) against control (from undetectable to strong band at 24 and 48 h) in a dose-dependent manner. mRNA transcripts of p53 were also increased against the control (increase by four-fold at 48 h; Figure 6b). Both sets of RT-PCR results were examined by GAPDH as the internal control, which showed no difference in sample loading.",

Our results revealed that p53 phosphorylation was activated by hyperoxia as determined using specific antibodies against the site of Ser37 and Ser392. The results showed that increased phosphorylation at Ser37 (three-fold increase at 48 h 95% oxygen) (Figure 6c). Ser392 of p53 was also shown a two-fold increase at 12 h 95% oxygen compared with the control (not shown). The above data indicate that both p53 and p21 may be associated with MAPK activity upon hyperoxic toxicity. Since above results also indicate that apoptosis was involved in hyperoxia, thus p21 may have a protective role in hyperoxic DNA damage. Finally, we dissected whether BER affected p21 or p53. Our results indicate that overexpression of BER hOgg1 increased p21 and p53 activity compared with the vector controls. However, p21 induction was not dependent on p53 (data not shown). Taken together, BER proteins may have an interaction with p21 and p53. It is still unclear whether p21 is a result of the upregulated p53. Finally, we have also revealed a three-fold increase in phosphorylation of CDC2 at Thr161 after 48 h 95% exposure (Figure 6d). Since the CDC2-cyclin B heterodimers act to trigger all the major events of mitosis, hyperoxia may induce both death and living signaling in damaged cells. The fate of the cell will eventually be decided by the balance and interaction of the complex signaling pathways, particularly BER and MAPK along with p53 and p21 (Figure 7 for the hypothetic pathway during hyperoxic injury).",

This observation is based on the fact that overexpression of the BER hOgg1 attenuated the hyperoxia toxicity while with altered MAPK activity. This indicates that BER gene products may reduce DNA damage related to MAPK activity. Further experiments suggest that apoptosis was induced while reduction in p38 and increase in ERK1/2 alleviates the toxicity. Previous reports have indicated that oxidative stress can regulate MAPK through mismatch DNA repair pathways.28 To our knowledge, this study is the first to show such a mechanism by which hyperoxia-induced MAPK activity may be associated with the BER pathway.

The increase in p53 was the reason of inducing a G2 cell cycle arrest. BER intermediates are reported to induce p53-independent cytotoxic and genotoxic responses;53 thus, it is unclear whether hyperoxia can induce p53-dependent genotoxic responses. Previous reports have shown that p53 can be phosphorylated at the Ser392 by UV, but not by ionizing radiation.54 This study demonstrates that the regulation of p53 was also at the post-transcriptional level, with p53 phosphorylation occurring at several sites including Ser37 and Ser392. Previously, only phosphorylation at Ser15 was reported to be related to hyperoxic activation. Therefore, this study has provided novel insights into the molecular mechanism of hyperoxia.",

These studies provide new insight into cellular signaling pathways under hyperoxic toxicity, suggesting that alteration of MAPK may be a viable approach to reducing hyperoxic toxicity. Detailed interaction between BER and MAPK still remains to be elucidated. Future work may be undertaken to address whether hOgg1 directly regulates MAPK action. This may be achieved by investigating whether p38 and ERK act differently in the absence or in the presence of hOgg1. Further identification of the interaction may yield additional knowledge for the development of better treatment of hyperoxic toxicity.",

This virus was used to infect E86 cells. E86 cells were selected by FACS sorter via EGFP marker to obtain stable clones producing high titers of virus. The viral supernatant was used to generate hOgg1 expressing A549 cells. Initial transduction efficiency of A549 cells was about 40%, and EGFP positive cells were sorted by FACS sorter to gain populations of approximately >99% cells. A series of single colonies with high expression levels was selected and identified by FACS for the measurement of EGFP expression again and followed by hOgg1 activity assay for the measurement of hOgg1 expression.",
