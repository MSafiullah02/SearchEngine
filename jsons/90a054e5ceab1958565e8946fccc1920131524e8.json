            "text": "46 Results and conclusions: We included data from 42 studies of ALL and IBD patients; four 47 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including 3,993 patients, 20 observational studies including 48 796 patients, and 18 case reports including 60 patients. Hepatotoxicity in the form of sinusoidal 49 obstruction syndrome (SOS) occurred in 9-25% of the ALL patients in two of the four included 50 RCTs using 6TG doses of 40-60 mg/m 2 /day, and long-term hepatotoxicity in the form of nodular 51 regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) was reported in 2.5%. In IBD patients treated with 6TG doses of 52 approximately 23 mg/m 2 /day, NRH occurred in 14% of patients; SOS has not been reported. At a 53 6TG dose of approximately 12 mg/m 2 /day, NRH was reported in 6% of IBD patients, which is 54 similar to the background incidence. According to this review, doses at or below 12 mg/m 2 /day are 55 rarely associated with notable hepatotoxicity and can probably be considered safe. 56 4 57 INTRODUCTION 58 Hepatotoxicity was first noted as a complication of 6-thioguanine (6TG) treatment in the late 59 1970s[1] and has since been described in the form of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) in 60 childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)[2-4] and nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) 61 in both inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)[5] and childhood ALL.[6] This reflects that SOS and 62 NRH possibly represent a spectrum of related hepatic microvascular disorders spanning acute onset 63 to chronic manifestation, although the underlying cellular mechanisms that connect them remain to 64 be established Fig 1.[7-9] 65 66 Fig 1. The pathophysiology of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. 67 The presumed pathophysiological mechanism underlying sinusoidal obstruction syndrome is a 68 drug-mediated damage to sinusoidal endothelial cells, causing swelling and loss of fenestration. 69 This allows red blood cells to enter the space of Disse and dissect off the endothelial lining. The 70 sloughed off cells embolise downstream and cause obstruction of the hepatic microcirculation and 71 consequently hepatocellular necrosis.[7] These pathophysiological changes lead to the clinical 72 symptoms: jaundice, tender hepatomegaly, ascites and fluid retention.

            "text": "74 75 The development and severity of 6TG-induced hepatotoxicity appear to be dose-related, and rarely 76 occurs at low cumulative doses.[10,11] Hence, a non-systematic review from 2013 focusing on IBD 77 patients reported NRH in 0-53% of patients at 6TG doses of 12-58 mg/m 2 /day (20-100 mg/day) 78 with no cases reported with 6TG doses below 12 mg/m 2 /day.[5] A meta-analysis from 2011 79 analysed 6TG treatment in childhood ALL and reported a seven-fold increased incidence of SOS in 80 two of three randomised controlled trials (RCTs), in which patients received 6TG at doses of 40-60 81 mg/m 2 /day instead of 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) during maintenance treatment.[12] 5 82 83 Overall survival for childhood ALL now exceeds 90%;[13] however the poor prognosis following 84 relapse still remains a major challenge.[14] Thus, although a number of novel anti-leukaemic 85 treatment options, including immunotherapy, have emerged in recent years, their role in first line 86 therapy remains uncertain.[13] Therefore, it is important to explore possible improvements with the 87 use of the traditional anti-leukaemic agents, including thiopurines. The theoretical pharmacological 88 advantages of 6TG over 6MP include a more direct intracellular activation pathway, higher 89 potency, and shorter duration of exposure necessary for cytotoxicity. The cytotoxic effect of 6TG 90 and 6MP is ascribed to the metabolite thioguanine nucleotides (TGN), which are incorporated into 91 DNA and RNA as false purine bases as well as inhibiting de novo synthesis of purines.[3,15] Red 92 blood cell (RBC) levels of TGN (ery-TGN) have been assumed to reflect treatment intensity and 93 adherence. An ery-TGN level of more than 230-260 pmol/8\uf09e10 8 RBC has been associated with 94 therapeutical response in IBD patients. However, the association between metabolite levels, 95 efficacy, and adverse events remains uncertain.[16] It was recently demonstrated that ery-TGN 96 correlate with TGN incorporated into leucocyte DNA (DNA-TGN). Furthermore, higher levels of 97 DNA-TGN correlate with a lower relapse risk in childhood ALL.[17] This finding calls for a 98 reassessment of the feasibility of prolonged 6TG treatment for childhood ALL, while avoiding the 99 risk of severe hepatotoxicity.",

We excluded 118 studies investigating 6TG as part of an intensive chemotherapy regimen. Since most studies using 119 6TG for an extended period of time either as monotherapy or as part of maintenance treatment are 120 within the field of IBD and ALL, we chose to limit the review to these two disease populations. We 121 compared 6TG treatment to 6MP or standard of care (other non-6TG treatment regimens). We 122 included studies published between 1998 and March 2018. We made no restrictions regarding 123 timing, type of setting or language. 124 125 Information sources 126 We systematically searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase/Ovid, Scopus/Elsevier, Web of Science 137 and Therapeutics (EACPT). The ClinicalTrials.gov registry (www.clinicaltrials.gov), the 138 International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) registry (www.controlled-139 trials.com), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) 140 (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en) were searched for research protocols, and PROSPERO was searched 141 for on-going systematic reviews.

Two review authors independently screened titles 146 and abstracts and subsequently evaluated eligible reports in full text. We recorded reasons for 147 exclusion. 148 149 Data collection process 150 Two review authors independently extracted data from included studies in duplicate using a 151 standardised extraction form, which was approved by all authors and pilot tested on ten reports. A 152 third author checked data extraction. A simplified sheet was used for articles in Polish, Russian, and 153 Chinese -with consultant help for data extraction. Extracted data items included authors and year 253 Doses in mg/m 2 were calculated with the assumption that an adult is 1.73 m 2 , and that 30 kg 254 correspond to one m 2 . 255 256 Synthesis of results 257 We included data from a total of 42 studies, encompassing four RCTs including 3,993 patients, 20 258 observational studies including 796 patients, and 18 case reports including 60 patients. 259 In two of three RCTs on 6TG versus 6MP at doses 6TG of 40-60 mg/m 2 /day for maintenance 260 treatment in childhood ALL, hepatotoxicity was reported in the form of SOS in up to 25% of 261 patients in the 6TG-arm.[2,3] The incidence of SOS was highest in the CCG-1952 trial, which used 262 the highest target dose. Moreover, in this trial the incidence of SOS was reduced to 20% when the 263 6TG target dose was changed from 60 to 50 mg/m 2 .[3] Evidence of persisting hepatotoxicity 264 including NRH and complications of portal hypertension were reported in 2.5% of patients 265 receiving 6TG. No hepatotoxicity was reported during 6MP treatment.[2,3] One of the RCTs on 266 6TG versus 6MP did not report SOS, but found evidence of hepatotoxicity by means of an 267 increased risk of discordant thrombocytopenia during 6TG treatment.[25] 268 Starting doses of 6TG of approximately 23 mg/m 2 /day were used in five observational studies of 269 adults with IBD, which were associated with elevated liver enzymes in 8-25% of patients and 270 histological evidence of NRH in 14-23% of patients. Seven studies used a lower 6TG dose of 271 approximately 12 mg/m 2 /day, and NRH was reported in 0-6% of patients.[43]",

            "text": "272 In regard to the included case reports, the 6TG dosage was higher in the ones that reported 273 hepatotoxicity (14-125 mg/m 2 /day) [47, 48, 59, 62, [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] 55, 57, 58] compared to the ones that did not 274 report hepatotoxicity (0.8-21 mg/m 2 /day).[41,54,56,61] 275 Hepatotoxicity documented by blood samples, various imaging modalities, or liver biopsy was not 276 persistently associated with higher ery-TGN levels.[30,63,64] 304 but did not occur with low daily doses of 6TG.[10] Most of the included studies did not find an 305 association between ery-TGN-levels and hepatotoxicity, thus the findings do not support the use of 306 ery-TGN for assessing the risk of 6TG-induced hepatotoxicity. 307 308 Several factors in the included observational studies investigating IBD may have led to an 309 overestimation of hepatotoxicity. The risk of NRH development is associated with the use of 310 immunosuppressive drugs often applied in IBD such as azathioprine, 6MP, ciclosporin, and 16 311 steroids.[65] Thus, hepatotoxicity has been recognised in as many as 20% of IBD patients treated 312 with azathioprine, 6MP, or methotrexate.[66] Azathioprine is the thiopurine most often associated 313 with NRH,[67] and since most of the 6TG-treated IBD patients have received azathioprine 314 previously, signs of NRH could have been present beforehand. As baseline liver biopsies prior to 315 6TG treatment were not obtained in any of the studies, some of the reported cases of NRH may 316 likely have been triggered by other factors than 6TG. Furthermore, NRH or sinusoidal dilatation has 317 previously been found in 6% and 34% of liver biopsies, respectively, from thiopurine-na\u00efve IBD 318 patients,[68] and the prevalence of NRH is probably as high as 5% in the background population, as 319 suggested by autopsy studies of otherwise healthy individuals.[65,69] Thus, the incidence of NRH 320 around 6% in the studies using 6TG at doses of approximately 12 mg/m 2 /day may not differ notably 321 from the background incidence. Additionally, selection bias arising from only taking a biopsy in 322 patients with suspected hepatotoxicity is supposedly present in most of the studies included in this 323 review. Only one study performed liver biopsies in all patients in the cohort, avoiding selection 324 bias, and found NRH in 6 % (N=7).[43] 325 326 The patient populations of the observational IBD studies had all failed conventional 327 immunosuppressive treatment because of clinical unresponsiveness or adverse events, and 328 undergone substantial surgery. Thus, the results cannot be generalised to the broader group of IBD 329 patients. Moreover, 6TG undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the intestines and the liver; 330 yielding bioavailability between 5-37%.[29] How IBD per se affects absorption and 331 pharmacokinetics of 6TG is unknown.[34] The true incidence of hepatotoxicity in IBD patients 332 treated with 6TG therefore remains unknown. However, a consensus paper by the European 6TG 333 working party from 2006 recommends that 6TG can be used in a clinical research setting, in doses 334 not exceeding 25 mg/day, corresponding to 14 mg/m 2 /day, which is considered a safe dose.[70] 335 This is supported by the results of this systematic review. 17 336 337 While liver biopsy with reticulin stain remains the gold standard for diagnosis of 338 hepatotoxicity,[67] non-invasive techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging/angiography 339 (MRI/MRA) and Doppler ultrasound examination are frequently used as screening tools. A study 340 comparing MRI to liver biopsy results found a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 72% in 341 detecting NRH.[71] Furthermore, MRI is useful for detection of NRH-associated complications, 342 including splenomegaly or ascites.[71] The European 6TG working party suggests screening by 343 complete blood count, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, 344 gamma-glutamyl transferase, bilirubin, and C-reactive protein at baseline as well as one, two, four, 345 eight, and 12 weeks followed by 3-month intervals.[70] When using low-dose 6TG, a liver biopsy 346 is no longer routine practice but is reserved for patients with symptoms of portal hypertension or 347 persisting liver test abnormalities.[43] 348 Determination of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) may be useful in the evaluation of the 349 risk of complications, since varices only develop, when HVPG exceeds 10 mmHg. However, being 350 an invasive technique it is rarely used.[31] The features of hepatotoxicity that have the highest 351 sensitivity include discordant thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly. The latter is easily detected by 352 clinical and ultrasound examinations. [72] 353 354 NRH is asymptomatic in most cases; leading to laboratory abnormalities without clinical signs, or is 355 complicated by portal hypertension.[73] In a study evaluating 1,886 liver transplant patients, NRH 356 was the reason for transplant in less than 1% of the cases.[74] In the studies included in this review, 357 two patients required liver transplantation.[2,3] This indicates that NRH rarely leads to hepatic 358 failure. 359 18 360 The present review emphasises the need for international standardised definitions of 6TG-related 361 hepatotoxicity, clinical trials evaluating the use of non-invasive diagnostic methods in regard to 362 detection of hepatotoxicity, and studies investigating the underlying mechanisms of 6TG-related 363 hepatotoxicity. The included RCTs solely evaluated high doses of 6TG; hence, RCTs on low-dose 364 6TG are warranted. A RCT evaluating very low and individually titrated doses of 6TG (2.5-12.5 365 mg/m2/day) with concurrent conventional 6MP/methotrexate maintenance therapy in childhood 366 ALL is currently being undertaken (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:NCT02912676). 367 368 Limitations 369 We included only patient populations with IBD and childhood ALL, which are the two largest 370 groups of patients treated with 6TG. Generalisation in respect to 6TG-related hepatotoxicity of 371 these two distinct populations must be interpreted with caution. A few separate reports exist of 6TG",

These 375 studies were not included because of short duration of 6TG administration and the extensive 376 concomitant therapy with hepatotoxic drugs. Moreover, we found inconsistencies in the definitions 377 of hepatotoxicity as well as in the diagnostic modalities across the included studies, which may 378 limit the comparability between the studies. Finally, all studies investigating 6TG treatment in the 379 IBD population were observational, without control groups, which entail higher risk of bias, 380 particularly publication bias and confounding bias.

[12] SOS was 295 highlighted as a dose-related toxicity with a multifactorial aetiology. No SOS was reported in the 296 COALL-92 trial, albeit a high frequency of discordant thrombocytopenia, which may reflect a 297 minor degree of hepatotoxicity. In that trial, vincristine and corticosteroids were not co-298 administered with 6TG -as was the case in the other two RCTs. [25] This difference in the co-299 medication has been proposed to be an explanation for the differing incidence of SOS between the 300 three RCTs. [2] 301 302 The theory that NRH is 6TG dose or ery-TGN level-dependent was first presented in 2005. [11] 303 This is supported by a mouse model, in which SOS arose from high peak concentrations of 6TG, 397 LNT created and pilot tested the data extraction form. SA, MSS and LNT extracted the data, made 398 assessments of risk of bias and confidence in cumulative evidence. LNT drafted the manuscript.",
