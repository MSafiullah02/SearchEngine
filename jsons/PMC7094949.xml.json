            "text": "The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by lung injury caused by either indirect or direct insults, which could be worsened by the way mechanical ventilation is applied [1]. Indeed, tidal overdistension (volutrauma) and cyclic alveolar recruitment and derecruitment (atelectrauma) during ventilation may further damage the lungs, and increase local production and release of inflammatory mediators (biotrauma), eventually resulting in multiple organ dysfunction and death [2]. So-called lung-protective ventilation strategies using low tidal volumes (6 mL/kg predicted body weight, PBW) and higher levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to prevent volutrauma, atelectrauma and biotrauma are by now widely accepted approaches in ARDS patients [3\u20137].",

Initiation of ECMO allows reductions in the tidal volume size, PEEP and plateau pressure (Pplat) levels, as well as inspired oxygen fractions (FiO2) [8\u201310], which all may help to improve outcome via prevention of additional lung injury [11, 12].

In the present analysis, however, higher PEEP was not associated with better outcome when included in the multivariable analysis. Recent evidence suggests that the change in \u0394P resulting from an increase in PEEP levels is an important predictor of survival in patients with ARDS [7]. In other words, changes in the PEEP level could improve outcome through its effects on the \u0394P: if the \u0394P decreases, outcomes could improve, but when \u0394P increases, outcomes could become worse.",

Indeed, high FiO2 may induce pulmonary injury, at least in part by increased oxidative stress via increased levels of reactive oxygen-derived free radicals, with an influx of inflammatory cells, increased permeability and endothelial cell injury [36, 37].",

One possible explanation for this is that severity scores are usually calculated from data collected at ICU admission and the first day of stay in the ICU, and not at ECMO initiation.

At each breath, the ventilator transfers some energy to the respiratory system, and there is considerable dissipation of energy, probably resulting in heat and lung tissue damage during each breath. This energy is closely related to the \u0394P and respiratory rate [42]. ECMO could allow the lung to rest, through the reduction of driving pressure via tidal volume and plateau pressure reduction and/or increase of PEEP, and through the decrease in respiratory rate via increase in sweep gas flow and PaCO2 removal.",

These variables, together, could be quantified as mechanical power [43]. Recently, it was shown that lung injury is highly dependent from mechanical power, that is, the product of tidal volume size, Pplat, and respiratory rate [43]. If mechanical power is \u2018excessive\u2019, then the chemical bonds of the polymers composing the extracellular matrix could get disrupted [43]. The relationship between mechanical power and outcomes in patients undergoing ECMO needs further attention in future studies.",

            "text": "The present analysis has several limitations, including its non-randomized design, which precludes any inference of causality regarding the association between \u0394P and outcome. In addition, it cannot be excluded that residual confounding not accounted for in this study might have biased the results. Also, ventilatory settings and parameters were collected only once per day in the original studies. Mechanical ventilation, however, is a continuous and dynamic intervention, and settings may have changed rapidly with a 24-h period, especially shortly after the start of ECMO. Data from only the first 3 days of ECMO were included in the analysis of mortality because recent studies have suggested that ventilation during such a period is the most important factor related to the prognosis of patients [9, 33]. Whether specific ventilatory strategies after day 3 would change patient outcomes is yet to be determined, and larger prospective studies may shed light onto this aspect. Also, the fact that \u0394P could represent only a marker of disease severity should be taken in account. It was impossible to determine the number of patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, and the potential impact of this condition in the outcome was not assessed. However, since most of the patients presented with pneumonia and use of vasoactive drugs, one could assume that most of them had severe sepsis and septic shock. The heterogeneity of the different study populations, with diverse indications of ECMO and dissimilar approaches to ECMO and ventilatory management, may further limit the inferences that can be drawn from the present analysis. While grouping patients from several centers around the world may improve the study\u2019s generalizability, the fact that most studies were conducted in expert centers may also serve to limit generalizability outside of these settings. Prone position has clearly been shown to benefit patients with severe ARDS [44], and proning could have affected the results of this analysis. Information on proning was unfortunately largely lacking in the databases. However, proning of patients receiving extracorporeal blood treatment was, at least until recently, model hardly performed. Finally, the impact of ventilatory parameters in the subgroup of patients with intracranial hemorrhage or severe bleeding events was not specifically addressed in the present study.",
