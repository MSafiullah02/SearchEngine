The data also suggest that this virus is likely to be an animal coronavirus, whose probable host could be civet cats, badgers, or some rodents. This virus may have been present for sometime before deletions in the genome occurs that enable it to cross from its natural host to humans [Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003; Ruan et al., 2003] .",

In our hands, virus titre of 10 7 plaque-forming units (PFU) per ml of cell culture supernatant can easily be attained within 24 hr of inoculation, with a starting multiplicity of infection (MOI) of $10. Furthermore, no reduction of virus titre has so far been observed despite multiple passages (unpublished data, E.E. Ooi & E.E. See). Since the SARS coronavirus appeared to favour Vero E6 cells compared to the other cell lines, we sought to examine the early microscopic events of SARS coronavirus infection in Vero E6 cells.",

This study demonstrated that the process of virus attachment, internalisation, and uncoating of the core particles occurred within a 30-min period. The virus entered the cells by fusing part of the virus envelope protein with the plasma membrane (Fig. 1) . Numerous virus particles were able to infect the same cell, although internalisation was not synchronised (Figs. 2 and 3) .",
