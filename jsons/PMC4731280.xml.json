The influenza pandemic of 1918 killed nearly 50 million people worldwide, with the elderly having the highest mortality rate [1], [2]. A strong, primary immune response is important for protection against influenza viruses, since changes in the antigenic epitopes of the viruses occur rapidly. The immune response alters and diminishes with aging [3], [4], leaving the elderly more susceptible to infectious diseases. CDC estimates that from the 1976\u20131977 season to the 2006\u20132007 flu season, flu-associated deaths ranged from 3,000 to 49,000 people (CDC, 2010), and 90% of these deaths are among the elderly [5].",

Two different vaccines are presently used in the United States: a killed vaccine (trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, TIV) that has been utilized since 1945 [7], and a live, attenuated vaccine that was approved by the FDA in 2003 for people between the ages of 2\u201349 [8], [9]. While both vaccines are effective in young adults, a diminished efficacy of TIV is consistently found in elderly recipients [10], [11]. The live, attenuated influenza vaccine is not approved for use in individuals with weakened immune systems or in the elderly [8], [9]. A high dose TIV vaccine has been reported to increase antibody response and to reduce the development of influenza by 22% in the elderly compared to the traditional dose of TIV [12], [13], [14]. However, neither dose totally prevents the disease.",

Adjuvants have also been shown to enhance cross-reactive responses [15]. However, at present, there are very few adjuvants commercially available for use in humans [16]. Aluminum salt (Alum) is the first and only adjuvant approved in the United States for general use in vaccines [17], [18]. During the 1960s and 1970s, many influenza vaccines commercially available in both the United States and Europe were alum-adsorbed. However, alum was removed from influenza vaccine formulations in the early 1980s because large clinical data showed that it only marginally enhanced the antibody response, while inducing increased adverse effects [19], [20], [21].",

It is a member of a family of proteins found in both free-living and parasitic nematodes [28]. The recombinant Ov-ASP-1 (rOv-ASP-1) has a predicted molecular weight of 24.9 kD [28]. The adjuvanticity of rOv-ASP-1 has been studied using ovalbumin, HIV-1polypeptide, SARS-CoV peptide antigens, and several commercially available vaccines [23], [24], [26], [29]. rOv-ASP-1 functions as an adjuvant that enhances not only Th2, but also strong Th1 immune responses [23], the latter of which is critical for stimulating antiviral immune responses. We previously reported that rOv-ASP-1, when co-administrated with TIV using an aqueous formulation, significantly improves the influenza-specific antibody response and protection against lethal infection in young mice [25]. In the current study, we found rOv-ASP-1 similarly enhances influenza-specific response to TIV in aged mice.",

Therefore, we investigated the ability of rOv-ASP-1 to enhance Th1 (IgG2a) and Th2 (IgG1) antibody responses in aged mice. It has been reported that unlike BALB/c mice, B6 mice do not have an IgG2a gene, but express a different Th1 antibody, IgG2c, which cross-reacts with IgG2a [33], [34], [35]. We, therefore, determined influenza-specific IgG2c titers. Three weeks after i.m. immunization with TIV or TIV + rOv-ASP-1, titers of IgG1 and IgG2c in plasma were determined by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 2\n, TIV alone induced an IgG1 response, and rOv-ASP-1 significantly enhanced IgG1 levels compared to TIV alone (p\n = 0.045). TIV alone, however, did not induce detectable IgG2c, while co-administration of rOv-ASP-1 induced high levels of IgG2c compared to TIV alone (p\n = 0.028), which was also comparable to levels of IgG1. These results demonstrate that primary immunization of aged mice with rOv-ASP-1 + TIV induces an increase in both IgG1 and IgG2c responses, and, importantly, elicits a significant influenza-specific IgG2c response that does not occur with TIV alone.",

PR8 virus is a mouse-adapted H1N1 influenza virus that was isolated in 1934. This virus differs substantially from the recently isolated A/California/7/2009 NYMC X-181 (H1N1) strain that is a component of TIV. We reported that rOv-ASP-1 enhanced a cross-reactive IgG response in young adult mice and provided protection against an infection induced by the antigenically different PR8 strain[25]. To test if rOv-ASP-1 could enhance a cross-reactive antibody response in aged mice as well, mice were immunized i.m. with TIV or TIV + rOv-ASP-1. The cross-reactive responses at weeks 1 through 3 post primary immunization were determined by ELISA in which the plates were coated with inactivated PR8 virus. No cross-reactive antibodies were detectable at week 1 with either immunization (data not shown). At weeks 2 and 3, cross-reactive antibody levels were detected in mice immunized with TIV + rOv-ASP-1, while no cross-reactive antibody was detected in TIV alone group at week 2, and only a marginal level was detected at week 3 (Fig. 3\n). These data demonstrate that TIV + rOv-ASP-1 can induce a cross-reactive antibody response, however, at a lower level than we previously observed in young adult mice [25].",

We demonstrated in young adult mice that rOv-ASP-1 is an effective adjuvant that: accelerates and enhances the influenza-specific antibody response induced by TIV; allows antigen sparing; and augments a Th1-biased and cross-reactive antibody response that confers heterologous protection [25]. In the current study, we confirmed previous studies that immunization with an inactivated influenza vaccine induces significantly lower levels of IgG in aged vs young mice (Fig. 1) [43], [44]. However, when co-administered with rOv-ASP-1, influenza-specific IgG was significantly increased in aged mice, was higher than immunization with a 5\u00d7 higher dose of TIV alone, and importantly, was comparable to that of young adult mice receiving TIV alone (Fig. 1). Further, TIV + rOv-ASP-1 increased both Th1 and Th2 antibody responses (Fig. 2). Interestingly, Bungener et al. [32] demonstrated that mice immunized with influenza vaccine plus alum only showed an enhanced Th2 response but suffered more severe weight loss and had significantly higher virus loads in their lungs than those receiving vaccine alone.",

It has been reported that both attenuated and inactivated influenza vaccines may induce cross-protective immunity against antigenically distinct virus strains in mice [42]. The cross-reactive antibody usually targets the HA stem region, since it is the conserved part of HA [45]. However, such antibodies are rarely seen in humans after infection or vaccination with seasonal influenza virus strains [46]. Our previous study in young adult mice demonstrated that rOv-ASP-1 could enhance the production of cross-reactive antibodies and confer protection against infection caused by a heterologous strain of influenza [25]. In the present study, we found that TIV + rOv-ASP-1 induced a low level of cross-reactive antibody to whole PR8 virus in aged mice 2 weeks after primary immunization while TIV alone did not (Fig. 3). These findings in aged mice are different from that observed in young adult mice where cross-reactive IgG antibody to HA of PR8 was detected in plasma after secondary, although not primary, immunization with TIV + rOv-ASP-1 [25]. Interestingly, however, after primary immunization of both young adult [25] and aged mice (Fig. 4), protection was observed after challenge with the antigenically different strain of influenza virus, PR8. The protection provided by TIV + rOv-ASP-1 may be associated with the low level of a cross-reactive IgG antibody in aged mice. This is similar to what has been observed in the aged population immunized with TIV: they have significantly lower levels of antibody responses to the circulating influenza virus and show influenza symptoms when infected with influenza virus, but demonstrate decreased hospitalization for pneumonia or influenza and also reduce the risk of death from all causes [47], [48], [49], [50].",
