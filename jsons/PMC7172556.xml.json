BMV has three genomic RNAs, designated as RNA1 (3.2 kb), RNA2 (2.8 kb), and RNA3 (2.1 kb). RNA1 and RNA2 are monocistronic and encode the 1a and 2a proteins, respectively, which are essential for the replication of the BMV genome (Ahlquist, 1992). RNA3 is dicistronic and encodes the 3a movement protein and the coat protein that is expressed via a subgenomic RNA. An in vitro system using highly enriched BMV replicase preparations from infected barley has been developed to study initiation of RNA synthesis from minimal templates. Using this system, accurate initiation of minus-strand, genomic plus-strand and subgenomic RNAs in vitro has been demonstrated Dreher and Hall 1988, Miller et al 1985, Sun et al 1996, Adkins et al 1997, Siegel et al 1997, Siegel et al 1998, Chapman et al 1998, Sivakumaran and Kao 1999.",

By virtue of its small size (27 nt), B2(\u2013)26G is amenable to studies with proton NMR. NMR analysis requires the RNA to be in one predominant conformation. Since the regions forming intramolecular base-pairing can have high potential to form a dimeric conformation through intermolecular base-pairing, it is important to ensure that the RNA forms a stable monomeric conformation. To examine this, UV melting experiments were done with B2(\u2013)26G over a 30-fold concentration range. Melting temperature (t\nm) for the major transition was estimated at 55.6(\u00b10.5) \u00b0C, and did not change appreciably over a concentration ranging from 2 to 60 \u03bcM, indicating that B2(\u2013)26G has a monomeric conformation. In addition, native gel analysis was performed to determine the number of electrophoretically distinct conformations of B2(\u2013)26G that may exist. As a control, a 17 nt RNA that exists both as a monomer and a dimer was used (Figure 1(a), lane 1). B2(\u2013)26G was found to migrate predominantly as a single band (Figure 1(a), lane 2), indicating that it does not form a dimer. Also, when tested in salt concentrations ranging from 50 to 200 mM, the mobility did not change, indicating that its conformation is stable in the range of salt conditions used for NMR studies.",

We sought to confirm or modify this predicted structure using the results obtained from NMR analysis. Although solving a complete tertiary structure at atomic resolution using NMR is a time-consuming process, one-dimensional (1D) imino NMR and two dimensional NMR spectra of an RNA molecule can be used to determine RNA secondary structure (Varani & Tinoco, 1991). When the imino protons are involved in base-pairing or forming an unusual conformation, they are usually protected from fast proton exchange with the water solvent, resulting in sharp imino proton peaks. If those protected imino protons are located within a 5 \u00c5 space, the crosspeaks between imino peaks can be observed by two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (2D NOESY), where protected imino protons in guanine and uracil bases will result in a NOE in a NOESY spectrum (Variani & Tinoco, 1991) and allow the assignment of nucleotides in base-pairs. As seen in Figure 1(b), the proposed secondary structure contains eight base-pairs with a U\u00b7U mismatch and a CUU tri-loop. If this structure is the major conformation in solution, we should be able to see major imino peaks from the two A\u00b7U, four G\u00b7C, and one G\u00b7U base-pair. The terminal A\u00b7U base-pair might not be stable due to increased flexibility caused by the adjacent 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 overhangs. More than eight imino peaks are observed in the 1D imino spectrum (Figure 1(c)), which indicates that the 27 nt RNA may have unusually protected imino peaks or some minor conformation that can be clarified by analyzing 2D water NOESY crosspeak pattern.",

Interestingly, the U\u00b7U mismatched base-pairs were observed and confirmed by its characteristic strong crosspeaks between the N3 proton of base-paired uracil bases and its connectivity with guanine 7 imino proton.

Mutant endscripts were all quantified after transcription and purification as described by Adkins et al. (1998). In essence, one picomole of each endscript was subjected to RNA synthesis assay and the amount of product synthesized was normalized to that produced by wild-type B2(\u2013)26G. B2(\u2013)26G yielded a predominant product of 26 nt, and some minor amounts of RNA one nucleotide longer and shorter due to non-templated nucleotide addition and premature termination, respectively (Figure 2(a), lanes 2-3). All three products initiated from the +1 cytidylate, since its change to a guanylate abolished all synthesis (Figure 2(a), lanes 4-5). Products directed by several of the mutant endscripts are shown in Figure 2(a) (lanes 6-15). Approximately 50 mutant endscripts were characterized according to the following scheme. To get an impression of the sequences important for RNA synthesis, a series of three nucleotide transitions starting at the 3\u2032 end up to position +21 were carried out. In general, mutations within the first seven positions relative to the 3\u2032 end of the template have a more severe effect on RNA synthesis than mutations from position +8 to +15 (Figure 2(b)). Some mutations near the 5\u2032 terminus also decreased RNA synthesis. We have previously analyzed the effect of changes in positions between +17 and +24 and found that sequence within this region is required for efficient RNA synthesis in a yet undetermined mechanism (Sivakumaran & Kao, 1999). We decided to focus on position +2 to +8 because this sequence is likely to be directly involved in the initiation process Sun et al 1996, Sun and Kao 1997a, Sun and Kao 1997b. We consequently tested every possible single nucleotide substitution from position +1 to +9, along with at least one change at position +10 to +21. In contrast to the BMV subgenomic promoter, where changes at key positions drastically reduced RNA synthesis (Siegel et al., 1997), we found that none of the substitutions prevented RNA synthesis except for a C/G change at the initiation site. However, position +4 to +7 were comparatively sensitive to substitutions. Interestingly, while single nucleotide substitutions of either the +6 or +7 guanylates with cytidylates resulted in low levels of synthesis, replacement of both guanylates with cytidylates in endscript +6,7 G/C restored synthesis to 75 % of that of B2(\u2013)26G (Figure 2(b)).",

A change of +2 adenylate to a guanylate, which should retain a wobbled G\u00b7U base-pair instead of a Watson-Crick A\u00b7U base-pair, resulted in 8 % synthesis Figure 2, Figure 3. A transition of the +3 uridylate to a cytidylate resulted in 18 % synthesis, while a replacement of three base-pairs in stem A with three G\u00b7C base-pairs abolished synthesis. Changes in loop 1 also greatly reduced RNA synthesis (Figure 3(b)). Lastly, since nucleotide substitutions that disrupted stem A had detrimental effects on RNA synthesis, we made a compensatory change to the +6 G/C endscript by replacing the +18 cytidylate with a guanylate. This double mutant, SS1, should maintain a predicted secondary structure similar to B2(\u2013)26G. However, RNA synthesis from SS1 was at 21 %. A similar change of +7 G/C along with the complementary change at +17 C/G in endscript SS2 resulted in only 26 % of the activity of B2(\u2013)26 (Figure 4(a)). Consistent with the findings that mutations may alter B2(\u2013)26G structure without significant loss of activity (Figure 3(a)), these results indicate that the preformed, predominant secondary structure of B2(\u2013)26G is not essential for directing plus-strand RNA synthesis.",

Two extremely unstable endscripts did result in inefficient RNA synthesis (Figure 4(b)). Nonetheless, no consistent correlation between RNA stability and the ability to direct RNA synthesis was observed. For example, endscript +10 C/U (\u0394G=3.4 kcal/mol) is predicted to have lower stability than B2(\u2013)26G (\u0394G=3.9 kcal/mol), but was nonetheless more efficient in directing RNA synthesis. In addition, +8 U/G (\u0394G=8.8 kcal/mol), was observed to direct RNA synthesis nearly twice as efficiently as B2(\u2013)26G.

The shape of the melting curve for B2(\u2013)26G, +3 U/A and +9 G/A suggests that they melted with multiple step transition, while +6,7 G/C undergoes a single step transition between two states (Figure 5(a)). With a crude estimate of the relative increase in absorbance and the magnitude of the slope for each transition, it seems that B2(\u2013)26G, +3U/A and +9G/A underwent a relatively sharp major transition and then a broad minor transition at higher temperatures (Figure 5(a)). The multiple transitions might be due to differential melting of secondary structure elements or the unstacking of the bases in the single-stranded portions of the RNAs. The absence of multiple transitions in +6,7G/C clearly shows that it has distinct thermodynamic properties from the other endscripts, implying a different conformation. In addition, even among B2(\u2013)26G, +3 U/A and +9 G/A, the overall shapes of the melting curves look different, which indicates that these RNAs undergo different unfolding processes. These results are consistent with the native gel analysis and suggest that the three mutant endscripts are altered in their secondary structures in comparison to B2(\u2013)26G and to each other.",

            "text": "To characterize the changes in the structures of the mutant endscripts more precisely, 1D imino spectra were taken at different temperatures (Figure 5(b)). The quality of the ca 12 peaks characteristic of B2(\u2013)26G were significantly affected by temperature. The peaks were relatively sharp at 20 \u00b0C (data not shown), but became increasingly broad at 30 \u00b0C and 40 \u00b0C, indicating that exchange with the environment of some of the imino protons increased at higher temperatures (Figure 5(b)). For ease of description, several of the imino peaks have been named in the spectra of B2(\u2013)26G (Figure 5(b)). Of interest is the U8-U16 interaction at approximately 11 and 9.7 ppm. This interaction appeared to be more sensitive to temperature changes compared to interactions associated with G\u00b7C base-pairs at approximately 13-13.4 ppm. Endscript +3U/A has only five of the peaks associated with B2(\u2013)26G (Figure 5(b)). At 20 \u00b0C, the U8-U16 interaction was retained in +3 U/A, as were the peaks associated with G\u00b7C base-pairs adjacent to the U8-U16 interaction. However, missing were the base-pairs at the bottom of stem A, as exemplified by the absence of the U5 peak at 14.4 ppm. At 40 \u00b0C, all the peaks were significantly broadened in comparison to those from B2(\u2013)26G, indicating that the mutation in +3U/A RNA destabilizes the structure of the RNA. Endscript +6,7 G/C gave a number of sharp peaks that do not correspond to the ones observed in B2(\u2013)26G (Figure 5(b)), indicating that +6,7 G/C exists in a different structural conformation than B2(\u2013)26G. The structure predicted for +6,7 G/C by the mfold program was different from that for B2(\u2013)26G (Figure 4(b)). In addition, since the peaks from +6,7 G/C remain well defined at 40 \u00b0C, its conformation is more stable than that of B2(\u2013)26G. This observation is consistent with its UV melt properties (Figure 5(a)). Endscript +9 G/A RNA, like +3 U/A RNA, retained a subset of the imino peaks observed in B2(\u2013)26G, mostly corresponding to those in stem A Figure 1, Figure 5. However, these peaks are different from those observed in +3 U/A RNA. Most notably, the U8-U16 signal was drastically broadened, indicating the absence of the U8-U16 interaction adjacent to the mutation at position +9. Compared with the spectrum taken at 20 \u00b0C (data not shown), most peaks were shifted and broadened significantly at 30 \u00b0C (Figure 5(b)). At 35 \u00b0C, all the peaks were severely broadened, indicating a rapid exchange of the imino protons with the environment due to destabilization of its conformation. Taken together, the biophysical characterization strongly suggest that the predominant structure in B2(\u2013)26G RNA was significantly altered by the introduced mutations. Therefore, the ability of endscripts to direct RNA synthesis by the BMV replicase under conditions that affect RNA conformation is of interest.",

To examine the latter possibility, competition assays were performed with several endscripts. This assay determines the ability of competitor RNAs to reduce synthesis directed by an efficiently recognized subgenomic RNA, \u221220/15 Siegel et al 1998, Sivakumaran and Kao 1999. Competitor RNAs were added at 10 and 20 molar excess of \u221220/15 and the amount of synthesis directed by \u221220/15 was quantified. As a negative control, we tested RNA B2(\u2013)\u03943\u2032, which has the three 3\u2032 nucleotides deleted. In comparison to a reaction lacking a competitor, B2(\u2013)\u03943\u2032 reduced synthesis from \u221220/15 to 86 % at ten molar excess and to 76 % at 20 molar excess (Table 1). This mild reduction in \u221220/15 synthesis is consistent with our previous observations that the initiation site is required for recognition by the BMV replicase (Sivakumaran & Kao, 1999). In contrast, three functional RNAs, B1(\u2013)26G, B2(\u2013)26G, and B3(\u2013)26G encoding the 3\u2032 ends of BMV RNA1, RNA2, and RNA3, reduced synthesis from \u221220/15 more severely, to 52, 63, and 63 % at ten molar excess, respectively (Table 1). CMV2(\u2013)26G, the equivalent 3\u2032 end of minus-strand RNA2 of CMV, reduced synthesis to 49 %, a more effective level of inhibition than seen with BMV RNAs (Table 1). While CMV2(\u2013)26G has the same 3\u2032 three nucleotides as BMV RNAs and can interact with the BMV replicase, it was unable to direct efficient synthesis by the heterologous BMV replicase (Sivakumaran & Kao, 1999). Endscripts +3 U/A, +9G/A, +6,7 G/C, and B3(\u2013)+4U/C were at least as capable competitors as B2(\u2013)26G (Table 1). These results suggest that the different levels of plus-strand RNA synthesis observed from the different endscripts is not due to a lack of recognition by the BMV replicase. Although it is possible that some RNA synthesis may be negatively affected by a replicase-endscript interaction that is too tight. Nonetheless, these competition results suggest that polymerization of nucleotides following the initial binding of the replicase to the initiation sequence contributes to the efficiency of RNA synthesis.",

In our mutational analysis we observed that guanylates introduced near the initiation cytidylate of RNA B2(\u2013)26G had a similar inhibitory effect (Figure 2(b)). Replacement of the native nucleotide with a guanylate from the +2 to +5 positions allowed synthesis between 8 to 44 % of B2(\u2013)26G. The detrimental effect of guanylates decreased as distance from the initiation cytidylate increased (Figure 7). From position +6 to +14, guanylates did not significantly affect RNA synthesis and sometime increased synthesis, as evidenced by guanylates at position +8 and +10 (Figure 7). However, guanylates at position +15 to +18 reduced RNA synthesis (Figure 7). The changes within position +15 to +18 likely affected a sequence previously observed to be important for RNA synthesis (Sivakumaran & Kao, 1999). Altogether, these results suggest that the identity of nucleotides at specific positions may affect the efficiency of RNA synthesis by the BMV replicase in vitro.",

In the latter case cytidylates near the initiation site should also be detrimental to synthesis. While we did observe that substitutions with cytidylates near the initiation cytidylate did have detrimental effects, the effects were not to the same degree as the guanylate substitutions. However, in examining the 3\u2032 ends of genomic plus-strand templates of approximately 60 viral templates, we observed a similar striking bias against guanylates and cytidylates from position +2 to +5, followed by a more normal distribution of these two nucleotides (Figure 8). This trend appears to be unique for templates directing the synthesis of plus-strand RNAs, since minus-strand synthesis does not follow the same trend (Figure 8). Together, the phylogenetic and mutational results are consistent with the testable hypothesis that the strength of the interaction between the template and the nascent RNA near the initiation site contributes to the efficiency of plus-strand RNA synthesis.",

The templates for synthesis of BMV RNA2 and RNA3 are identical in the first five positions and RNA1 and RNA2 are identical at the first 26 positions except at +4, where RNA1 has a cytidylate and RNA2 a uridylate (Figure 9(a)).\nIn vitro, B1(\u2013)26G directs only 42 % the amount of product as B2(\u2013)26G (Figure 9(b), lanes 1-2 and 3-4). In vivo, RNA1 is known to accumulate at 68 % of RNA2 (Marsh et al., 1991). To determine whether the +4 position is important in regulating the efficiency of RNA synthesis, we made B3(\u2013)26G with a +4U/C change and quantified the amount of synthesis relative to B2(\u2013)26G. Synthesis directed by B3(\u2013)26G was 114 % of that from B2(\u2013)26G (Figure 9(b), lanes 1-2 and 5-6). B3(\u2013)26G with a +4 U/C change decreased synthesis to 52 % of that from B3(\u2013)26G (Figure 9(b), lanes 5-6 and 7-8).

Results herein demonstrate that the endscript directing genomic plus-strand synthesis also interacts with the viral replicase via a mechanism that does not depend on a specific preformed RNA structure. For the subgenomic promoter, the recognition nucleotides include the initiation cytidylate (+1) and at least four positions 3\u2032 of the initiation site (positions \u221217, \u221214, \u221213, and \u221211) (Siegel et al., 1998) in a region determined to be important for BMV subgenomic RNA synthesis in infected cells (French & Ahlquist, 1988). For the genomic endscript, interaction with the replicase requires the initiation cytidylate and the neighboring \u22121 and +2 nucleotides. The sequence 3\u2032 to the subgenomic core promoter has been demonstrated to modulate the level of RNA synthesis Marsh et al 1988, Adkins et al 1997. In the genomic endscript, 5\u2032 sequence from +17 to +24 affect the level of RNA synthesis. Finally, both templates are rich in adenylates and uridylates. With the genomic endscript the A+U-rich nature of the template could affect synthesis, but not binding to the replicase (Figure 2(b) and Table 1).",

            "text": "The sequences directing plus-strand syntheses are part of the intermediate synthesized during viral replication. Given sufficient time, these intermediates will either associate intermolecularly with the complementary template to form stable double-stranded RNAs, or fold intramolecularly into a highly structured state (unless there are proteins that affect RNA structure). Since there are no sequences in common for genomic plus and subgenomic RNA synthesis except for the initiation cytidylate, it is likely that both promoters are recognized before stable RNA structures can be formed in the nascent RNA. Based on these and other observations Bujarski et al 1994, Adkins et al 1997, Siegel et al 1997, Siegel et al 1998, Sivakumaran and Kao 1999, we propose that the initiation of BMV genomic and subgenomic plus-strand RNA synthesis takes place while the replicase is still associated with the nascent RNA (Figure 10). In this model, when minus-strand RNA synthesis reaches the BMV RNA3 intercistronic sequence encoding the subgenomic promoter, the replicase is faced with a roadblock that signals the replicase to either continue copying the template RNA or reverse course and de novo initiate subgenomic RNA synthesis from the nascent RNA. Overcoming this roadblock may depend on the ability of the replicase to successfully pass the intercistronic sequence, which in several bromoviruses contain an unusual homopolymeric sequence Marsh et al 1988, Allison et al 1988, Allison et al 1989, Romero et al 1992 or contain stable stem-loop structures in other viruses Zavriev et al 1996, Koev et al 1999, or stable RNA-RNA interactions Kim and Hemenway 1999, Sit et al 1998. The replicases that cannot pass the intercistronic sequence would release the template RNA and initiate subgenomic RNA synthesis from the recently synthesized nascent RNA. The precise initiation position would be determined by the specific key nucleotides present in the subgenomic core promoter (Siegel et al., 1997). Bujarski et al. (1994) have noted that the BMV intercistronic sequence is a region for frequent template switching, and Nagy et al. (1999) have demonstrated that the AU content of a template may promote recombination, a process that depends on template switching. Further support for this hypothesis include the observations by French & Ahlquist (1988), who by placing a series of BMV subgenomic promoters at different positions found that promoters closer to the start site of minus-strand RNA synthesis directed more subgenomic RNA products.",

In the polycistronic red clover necrotic virus, the interaction in trans between two RNA sequences may prevent the progression of the viral replicase and induce subgenomic RNA synthesis (Sit et al., 1998). For the polycistronic potato virus X RNA, a series of repeated sequences that resemble transcription pause/termination sites of DNA templates may act to slow the progression of the replicase during minus-strand synthesis and thereby induce the initiation of plus-strand RNA synthesis (Kim & Hemenway, 1999).",

Structures at the 3\u2032 end of the viral genomic RNA that are required to direct genomic minus-strand synthesis have been demonstrated in several systems, including BMV Dreher and Hall 1988, Pogue and Hall 1992, Philipenko et al 1996, Song and Simon 1995, Draper 1995, Hong et al 1998, Chapman and Kao 1999. There may be major differences in the mode of recognition of promoters for minus versus plus-strand RNA synthesis. For plus-strand RNA viruses the genomic RNA is present in the infected cell prior to its translation and assembly of the replicase. Since all molecules prefer to exist in a lower energy state, the viral genomic RNA would possess highly ordered secondary and tertiary structures, which may be formed with the assistance of sequence-non-specific RNA-folding chaperons or sequence-specific RNA-binding cofactors (Weeks, 1997), such as the BMV 1a protein (Sullivan & Ahlquist, 1999). Hence, the replicase needs to recognize the highly structured genomic RNA to initiate minus-strand synthesis. The differences in the incidence of guanylates and cytidylates (Figure 8) provide another indication of the differences between minus and plus-strand RNA synthesis. The initiation of minus-strand RNA synthesis may also be affected by upstream sequence Carpenter et al 1995, Sullivan and Ahlquist 1999, Chapman et al 1998.",

This is different from the general notion of promoter-strength, which implies a modulation of the frequency of initiation events, and necessitates an emphasis on the frequency of successful transitions into processive elongation. Transcription studies using DNA templates indicate that the template sequence could affect the proportion of RNAs that are successfully transcribed to completion Keene and Luse 1999, Nudler et al 1997, Von Hippel and Yager 1991. A similar strategy may regulate RNA synthesis from RNA templates. An assumption of this hypothesis is that the viral sequence contains nucleotides that are selected at specified positions to enable proper transition from initiation to elongation phase of RNA synthesis and the optimal level of RNA accumulation. The difference in BMV RNA1 and RNA2 at the +4 position provides an example where a single-nucleotide change in the viral RNA can account for a difference in RNA accumulation (Figure 9).",

The increased affinity may affect the stability of the template-nascent RNA duplex interaction, i.e. too stable an interaction during initiation may prevent the replicase from making the transition from the initiation site, resulting in decreased RNA synthesis. Consistent with this testable hypothesis, we observed that guanylates and cytidylates negatively affected RNA synthesis when they were within four positions of the initiation nucleotide. Inconsistent with this hypothesis, however, is the fact that substitutions with guanylate and cytidylates do not have identical effects (Figure 2(b)). Stability of the template-nascent strand duplex is also affected by the contributing effects of the neighboring nucleotides (Turner et al., 1988), and a cytidylate substitution at a given position may not have the same thermodynamic effect as a guanylate. Alternatively, thermodynamic parameters may not be the sole factor affecting viral RNA synthesis. Another possible effect could be that the template sequence might also have evolved to influence translation.",

First, the recognition of the promoter may be directed by the sequence of the RNA. Sequence-specific recognition has been previously demonstrated for the bacteriophage T4 translational repressor RegA protein Webster and Spicer 1990, Brown et al 1997. Second, it is possible that the recognition of the genomic minus-strand RNA by the viral replicase could take by inducing tertiary interaction between protein and RNA which is tolerant of some differences in the RNA secondary structure. An induced-fit mechanism has been suggested for a number of RNA-binding proteins, including the splicing factor, U1A, the ribosomal S15 protein, and the binding of the hepatitis B encapsidation signal by the P protein Gubser and Varani 1996, Batey and Williamson 1996, Beck and Nassal 1997. There is also evidence for an induced fit mechanism for the recognition of the BMV subgenomic promoter by the BMV replicase. However, in our studies, the contacts in the RNA will induce a conformational change in the replicase, resulting in different nucleotide moieties being recognized Adkins and Kao 1998, Stawicki and Kao 1999. A subsequent change in the RNA secondary or tertiary structure after replicase binding to the RNA has not been ruled out. This induced fit mechanism is compatible with the ability of the replicase to recognize the subgenomic and genomic promoters without the release of the replicase during minus-strand RNA synthesis.",

The 2D H2O NOESY spectra were collected independently using a Bruker AMX-600 spectrometer equipped with a Bruker triple resonance triple-axis gradient probe and a Bruker DRX-500 spectrometer equipped with a Nalorac triple resonance z-axis gradient probe. The results from the two spectrometers were consistent. H2O NOESY spectra were collected at mixing times 200 ms and 300 ms at 20 \u00b0C. A total of 400 to 440 t\n1 blocks were taken, for each block, 32 scans were taken with a relaxation delay of two seconds. Solvent suppression was accomplished by replacing the last pulse in NOESY pulse sequence with a jump-return pulse sequence and applying z-gradient pulse during the mixing time. Proton chemical shifts were indirectly referenced to DSS using the water resonance. All NMR spectra were processed using FELIX 95.0 (Biosym Technologies, Inc.).",
