The procedure for exposure evaluation can be largely classified into two categories, that is, measuring environment and measuring organism; these are the procedures called as environmental monitoring and biological monitoring. Depending on the media and the agent, one or both of these methods are utilized. For example, both (organic) mercury from fish and cadmium from rice are heavy metals exposed through food consumption. Therefore, by monitoring the concentration of these metals in respective major food source, combined with food consumption data, exposure (ingested amount of mercury/cadmium) could be estimated. Biological monitoring for these metals is also possible by measuring the concentration of mercury in the hair (which reflects the concentration in the blood, and approximates the concentration in the brain) or cadmium in urine (which reflects the concentration in renal cortex). Detailed discussions about these two categories of monitoring are beyond the scope of this book, and interested readers should refer to existing textbooks.",

This is also true for the exposure to temperature or to noise, both of which are associated with atmospheric exposure. In conventional environmental health study or environmental epidemiology, environmental monitoring of the outdoor atmosphere at the residential area of the participants has been used as surrogates for individual/population exposure to the agents of concern. Implicit assumption here is that people would stay in their residence, and variation of the exposure due to their daily mobility is, if any, negligible. Although this assumption is not realistic at all, this approach has been successful in a sense evidenced by the existence of numerous epidemiological findings in this area in the past.",

Likewise, the exposure to environmental factors could be evaluated using such spatiotemporal data. Spatial resolution of various types of environmental data becomes so high that heterogeneity within the area of commuting distance could be documented.

Time scale of the mobility can range from moment to moment as exemplified by the Ecological Momentary Assessment (later in this chapter) to years, even including hundreds of centuries (like Out of Africa, the expansion of our ancestors)! Duration of the sojourn time should be considered as an independent factor and can also range from few seconds to generations; for example, workplace exposure to hazardous substances (including radioactive materials) would be evaluated in terms of minutes, while the effects of regional migration may emerge after several generations. Accordingly, spatial scale could range from a few meters to thousand kilometers. A few meter matters when micro-scale environments such as indoor (including air-conditioning) vs. outdoor, inside and outside of vehicle are considered, for example. At larger scale, proximity to major roads or any combustion facility could exert significant influences on exposure to noise or air pollutants. Far larger scale can change the environment as a whole; an important aspect in today\u2019s environmental health is that people can make a global scale travel within 24 h. Mobility of people also entails the change in the context; by changing the location, the socioeconomic and cultural aspects of the neighborhood would change, which may affect the meaning of material environment and, in turn, health status of the moving individuals. At the same time, change in location means the change in activities of the individuals; for example, individuals working at outside road construction site might have much higher physical activity levels (and increased ventilation rate) and higher exposure to heat, dust, and noise than staying at home.\n",

In this chapter, main focus will be on daily mobility of people for commuting and for other daily life activities. Geographical location is crucial for some physicochemical environmental factors other than air pollutants. One such example is heat environment, which consists of temperature, humidity, air flow, and radiation, and varies even with a very small scale, reflecting the variation of land use or land cover, local topography (layout of surrounding buildings, for example), or elevation. In addition, numerous heat sources are found in human-built environment, including exhaust gases, waste heat, etc. As a result of combined effects of these factors, most of the urban centers have warmer environment, compared to the surrounding areas, termed as heat island.",

In urban planning, grasping mobility of individuals is crucial to create an appropriate layout for transportation, public space/facilities, and private houses. In public health, mobility of individuals sometimes play key role in the spread of diseases (described later). Also, mobility has been one of a classical topic in the area of human ecology since it is associated with the question of how a population utilizes the environment spatially as well as temporally (time allocation studies). Mobility is also associated with energetics (utilization of somatic energy) as a part of physical activities in general. As such, many methods to grasp the mobility of individuals have been developed (Table 2.1), which will be discussed below.\n",

While this method is in a sense \u201cperfect\u201d since the observer can obtain whatever details she or he wants, obvious disadvantages include time-labor intensiveness, biased behavior due to the presence of observing researcher. A simplified variation of the time allocation is the spot-check method, in which researcher will observe the people\u2019s activity in certain fixed location(s) (e.g., see [9]). Despite its simplicity and easiness, spot-check method could provide valuable quantitative information. Activity diary is another classical method, which relies on the self-recorded diary. This would solve the issue of labor-intensiveness for researcher and could cover much larger number of individuals, but like other self-reporting methods, reliability and accuracy of the record are the main problems to be considered. Activity diary is useful when researchers are interested in qualitative aspects of the moving behavior.",

Generic name for the systems is global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), which is referring to any system that locates specific targets by use of the combination of signal-detecting device and a group of satellites. In this book, the \u201ctargets\u201d are basically human individuals, but they could be animals (so-called activity logger) or traffic vehicles. Spatial resolution of contemporary GPS is fine enough to locate individuals for many study fields, and it solves the issues of time-labor intensiveness and false or biased report. Thus, this has been used in various research areas including anthropology, human ecology, and presumably sociology, and urban studies (see [6, 11]). Another advantage is that GPS uses electrical data processing, which also alleviates the risk/errors associated with data transfer. On the other hand, in some area like inside building or underground malls the signal for GPS are generally weak and difficult to detect. Although the GPS could provide very rich and useful information regarding the mobility, individuals rarely own the device, and researchers need to provide and distribute it to the participants. This has been overcome by the recent propagation of GPS-equipped mobile phones and alike.",

Major advantage of this method is the fact nowadays a large proportion of populations own the mobile phone even in developing countries and in very remote areas. On the hand, researchers need to negotiate with mobile phone company to obtain such record, and the major barriers for such negotiation are as following: (1) conflict with the protection of privacy information (even when the information is provided in anonymous manner) may arise, (2) often there are two or more mobile phone companies operating in a given area, and (3) since the information is provided in anonymous manner, demographic parameters of the mobile owner are not known to the researcher.

First, exposure assumed to occur in the residential place of the participants (static exposure), that is, the mobility of the participants is neglected. Second, mobility of the people was taken into account in estimating exposure (dynamic exposure). Information on mobility was obtained through activity diaries collected from 8800 residents, which is then extrapolated to a synthetic (but reflecting the demographic structure of actual) population of approximately 5 millions. The target geographical region consisted of 1145 zones (327 municipalities) whose average area was 12 km2, and the location of each individual has been predicted for 1 week (7 days) by 1-hr interval. Pollutant concentrations are estimated for NO2 and ozone using air pollution models (i.e., an emission model combined with a dispersion model) for a year by 1 h interval and 1 \u00d7 1 km resolution with finer resolution along major roads. Based on the location data and pollution data, time-weighted exposure estimate was calculated under two conditions: with and without taking peoples\u2019 mobility into account. To estimate the municipality-wise health impacts of the exposure to these air pollutants, the time-weighted exposure estimate was converted into the respiratory mortality using the information of existing epidemiological data, which is then converted into years of life lost (YLL) following the burden of diseases framework by WHO.",

In addition, smartphone-based \u201cpersonal exposure monitoring kit\u201d has been developed that enables to capture not only the location of mothers and children but also their physical activities and air pollution by built-in accelerometer and sensors for UV and PM2.5.

This study analyzes the relationship between all-cause mortality among the elderlies living in Paris, France, or nearby area and land-surface temperature captured by satellites for a period of a heat wave occurred in August 2003. Based on a case-control study of 241 pairs of mortal-alive elderly people (age > 65), they found elevated odds ratio of mortality with increased land surface temperature (LST) of the residence area. Of noteworthy, the elevated odds ratio was associated with minimum (night time) LST averaged over either 13 days (whole observation period) or 6 days preceding the reported deaths but not with any LSTs averaged over 2 days preceding deaths or the day of death. This result suggested that the effect of heat might not be limited to immediate effects but might be \u201ccumulative\u201d to some extent. Also, approximately 0.37 \u00b0C of increase in temperature was associated with a significantly elevated odds ratio more than two, showing relatively potent effect of temperature on mortality. In this study, spatial resolution of the LST was 1 km2, and the case and control are matched, in addition to age and sex, for residential area, which contains 24\u2013150 pixels, allowing the temperature comparison between the case and control.

Travels (change of the location) beyond the border of each participant\u2019s \u201cprimary settlement\u201d (presumably where the residence is located) was counted and used for data analyses. A malaria prevalence map with 1 km2 resolution for 2009 has been used to classify the settlements according to their prevalence, then, combining the two types of information, that is, travels and prevalence observed in various settlements, they have estimated the proportion of the infected travels, which actually transported the malaria from one settlement to another. In this way, they could identify the source areas and the sink areas; the former supply the malaria, while the latter accept it. With such an analyses, they could show there were several distinct sources and sinks for Malaria in Kenya. Nairobi, the capital, and the area around the Victoria Lake were serving as the most remarkable sink and the source, respectively. Also, they observed that travel of people reflected the regional population density and regular travel, which is different from the travel of the parasites, where the lake regions serve as the primary source of the parasites, which flew into its surrounding areas and the capital area. Based on these observations, the authors suggested that the elimination program must take the imported case into account for the program to be successful. In addition, they demonstrated that this method could identify the \u201chot spot\u201d (settlement), which shows distinct export and import of malaria incidence compared to adjacent settlements and that it can also provide useful information for elucidating the mechanisms of smaller scale transmission. Such an analysis provides a good example demonstrating the huge potential of using spatial analyses in the area of disease propagation.",

The authors calculated the \u201cdengue suitability\u201d of each region mainly based on daily temperature, which was combined with the probability of importing the infection by travelers from epidemic area to estimate the regional (spatiotemporal) risk of dengue epidemic. The results considering the mobile phone data are compared with those obtained from conventional \u201cgravity\u201d model, in which the travel volume of the people depends on the population sizes of and distance between the two regions (beginning and end of the travel). The results of the two models sometimes differ widely; among the two regions that experienced real dengue epidemics in 2013, import of infection could not be predicted by the gravity model, while the model with mobile phone information could. Also, the risk map generated for entire Pakistan showed substantially different pictures between the two models. Part of the reason of such differences is related with the observation that contrary to conventional mobility model, the mobile phone data showed no decay of travel volume with increasing distance of the regions. Overall, this research demonstrated the importance of grasping mobility based on real observational data to understand the spread of infectious disease at the level of a country.",
