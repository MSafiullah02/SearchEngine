            "text": "The question of whether exercise increases the risk of URTIs has been studied by several investigators and remains controversial.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 These studies vary widely with respect to subjects, methods, and exercise load.4 Several epidemiologic studies (observational and case series) have supported the \u201cJ\u201d curve relationship between exercise and the risk of URTI.1, 2 This model suggests that moderate exercise improves immune function compared with sedentary persons, but prolonged high-intensity exercise may impair immune function by release of stress hormones. A \u201cwindow period\u201d of suppressed cell-mediated immunity often follows strenuous exercise.3 A dose\u2013response relationship between exercise load and risk of URTI is difficult to prove.4 It has been reported that up to 2 hours of moderate activity daily improved overall health in individuals and decreased URTIs by 29% compared with sedentary individuals.5 However, in the case of more extreme physical exertion in a study of marathon racers, running greater than 97 km/wk appeared to lead to more respiratory infections. Endurance events such as marathons were associated with infection in the week post race.6 However, world-class athletes may be able to tolerate heavy physiologic demands without significant immune suppression.7 Unfortunately, randomized controlled trials are difficult to conduct, and the current available studies reinforce the complex causal association between exercise and susceptibility to respiratory tract infections.4\n",

Acute bacterial sinusitis often follows viral or allergic rhinitis. Symptoms may include nasal congestion, purulent nasal discharge, fever, headache, facial pain, or maxillary tooth discomfort. Antibiotics should be considered for symptoms lasting >10 days or severe symptoms such as fever, facial pain, or perioribital swelling. While amoxicillin is preferred, emerging resistance has led to the use of amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin), macrolides, and fluoroquinolones. Providers should consider local resistance patterns and patient risk factors when prescribing antibiotics. Symptomatic treatment with antihistamines, decongestants, and nasal steroids may also be beneficial.",
