The cDNA encoding D. melanogaster ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase (DmUCH) (GenBank Accession No. NM_057592) was amplified using the first strand cDNA as a template and a pair of gene specific primers designed based on the nucleotide sequence of DmUCH. The gene specific primers are: PF (5\u2032-CCG CTC GAG AAA AGA ATG TTA ACC TGG ACG CCA CTT G-3\u2032) and PR (5\u2032-CAT GCG GCC GCT TGT TGT GCC GCG GTC AAG GCC-3\u2032). In order to express the native N-terminus of DmUCH, an XhoI restriction site was introduced to allow in-frame cloning of the gene into the \u03b1-factor secretion signal of pPICZ\u03b1-A expression vector and a nucleotides sequence encoding the KEX2 cleavage site was placed ahead of DmUCH. At the C-terminus, the stop codon was eliminated and replaced with a NotI restriction site, thus, the expressed DmUCH should ligate to the 6xHis-tag at the carboxyl terminus. PCR was performed as follows: preheating at 94 \u00b0C for 7 min, 30 cycles at 94 \u00b0C for 40 s, 55 \u00b0C for 40 s and 72 \u00b0C for 50 s, followed by an elongation at 72 \u00b0C for 7 min. A 690 bp fragment was recovered from the gel by using the E.Z.N.A Gel Extraction Kit, and cloned into a pMD18-T vector using the Original TA cloning Kit (TaKaRa, Japan). The nucleotide sequence of the DmUCH was confirmed by sequencing. The pMD18-DmUCH plasmid was digested with XhoI and NotI sequentially, and the DNA fragment was gel-purified and then cloned into the P. pastoris expression vector pPICZ\u03b1-A (Fig. 1\n). The constructed vector, pPICZ\u03b1-DmUCH, contains the complete DmUCH structural gene downstream the \u03b1-factor sequence, and was used to transform the competent E. coli Top10F\u2032. The plasmid DNA was prepared and the insert was confirmed by sequencing.",

But most of recombinant DmUCH have been expressed as inclusion bodies, and low-yield functional recombinant DmUCH was obtained after refolding the inclusion bodies. Recombinant DmUCH was successfully secreted into the culture supernatants by P. pastoris, and with the 6xHis-tag at the C-terminus of DmUCH, recombinant DmUCH was purified to homogeneity by an affinity chromatography (IMAC). Enzymatic activity assays indicated that the recombinant DmUCH had high activity to cleave the ubiquitin\u2013magainin fusion proteins and released the magainin that had activity against E. coli K12D31.",

But the fusion partner must be removed to obtain functional peptides. This can be achieved by introducing a protease recognition site, including tobacco etch virus (Tev) protease [36], factor Xa, or thrombin protease, in the fusion proteins[35]. However, cleavage of the fusion proteins with proteases may result in recombinant peptides with an unauthentic N-terminus [37], [38]. Furthermore, cleavage of the fusion proteins is rarely complete, which reduces the yield. In addition, proteases may nonspecifically cleave the fusion proteins. The ubiquitin and SUMO fusion proteins also require proteases to remove the tags. However, the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs), which are members of the cysteine protease superfamily, are distinct from other proteases in that they recognize the tertiary structure of the SUMO or ubiquitin. When the target protein is fused directly to the C-terminus of SUMO or ubiquitin, removal of the SUMO or ubiquitin will not add extra residues to the N-terminus of the target protein and therefore native-like recombinant proteins can be obtained [8], [39]. In the present study, when the ubiquitin\u2013magainin was treated with recombinant DmUCH, accumulation of recombinant magainin was observed with the reaction times. The ESI-MS analysis showed that the molecular weight of the purified magainin was 2465 Da, which is almost identical to the mass calculated from the amino acid sequence. These results indicated that the purified recombinant DmUCH can recognize and cleave the ubiquitin\u2013magainin fusion precisely with high activity to release the intact magainin with a native N-terminus.",

Purification of His-tagged proteins is based on the chelating metal ions as affinity ligands. The use of short histidine stretches or His-tags, typically as affinity tags at either the N-terminus or C-terminus, enables the purification of the desired protein from the crude extract in a single step by IMAC (immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography) [40], [41], [42]. The most widely used IMAC supports are either nickel nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resins or different chelating Sepharose matrices. Importantly, the binding specificity enables the purification of proteins under both native and denaturing conditions [41]. Now, numerous proteins and peptides have been purified using the His-tags, and several therapeutic candidates are in clinical studies [43]. His-tags have also been used for purification of proteins using the expanded bed adsorption [44], [45]. In the present study, the (His)6-tag has been attached to the C-terminus of DmUCH and to the N-terminus of ubiquitin\u2013magainin fusion protein, and the fusion proteins were easily purified by Ni-NTA. The (His)6-tag also facilitates purification of recombinant magainin after the ubiquitin\u2013magainin was cleaved by DmUCH for 60 min, because the fusion protein, UBI and UCH, but not the released magainin, all contain a His-tag and can be removed by Ni-NTA, and the magainin is the only peptide remained in the flow-through.",

Release of magainin was then confirmed by Tricine\u2013SDS\u2013PAGE and ESI-MS analyses.
