However, the gap between species is still the most challenging obstacle for translation of results from rodents to humans . With the great advancement of technology in molecular biology and gene modifi cation, the attempt to establish \"humanized\" mouse models has made a leap since 1990s [ 1 -3 ] . Nowadays, a wide variety of humanized mouse models have been generated and applied in nearly all fi elds of biomedical research [ 4 ] . In this chapter, we briefl y review the history and classifi cation of humanized mouse models and then summarize the current situation and recent advancement of their application in biomedical research, especially in the research of immune-related diseases.",

These HLAexpressed transgenic mice represent for a useful tool in studying in vivo TCR-restricted immune responses and thus were adopted in the studies of immune-related diseases during the fi rst 10 years of this century. For example, HLA-A0201-transgenic mice were used in inducing CD8 + T cell-restricted type I diabetes (T1D) [ 6 ] and experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) [ 7 ] , while HLA-DRB1-transgenic mice were applied in establishing CD4 + T cellmediated EAE [ 8 ], system lupus erythematosus (SLE) [ 9 ] and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) models [ 10 ] . More recently, the respective role of HLA-DR2 and HLA-DQ8 in EAE [ 11 ] and autoimmune diabetes [ 12 ] was also studied through transgenic mice. Meanwhile, transgenic mice with distinct HLA subtype expression favor the study of HLA-related susceptibility on specifi c diseases, such as EAE [ 13 ] , experimental autoimmune uveitis [ 14 ] , arthritis [ 15 -17 ] , allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis-like pulmonary responses [ 18 ] , and celiac disease [ 19 ] . Although the application of HLA-transgenic mice has been reduced due to the simplifi cation of diseases into specialized immune responses, the combination of HLA-transgenic technology and reconstitution of human immune system in immunodefi cient mice has re-assigned them vitality in biomedical research, which will be discussed in the next section.",

They claimed that mice transplanted with HEALs exhibited persistent normal liver function for weeks and thus provided a window for drugrelated investigation [ 34 ] .

However, the improvements in their survival, differentiation and even migration and residence [ 58 ] are still urgently required. Besides leukocytes, other blood components also play important roles during immune response and regulation.

The potent regulatory activity of the CD8 + Treg was mainly mediated by the expression of cytotoxic lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4 on cell surface, while their alloantigen-specifi city and the ability to induce the long-term tolerance favor their clinical application.

However, the residence and exchange of immune components in the locus are still diffi cult to rebuild in animal models because the physiological dynamics remains largely unknown The occurrence of humanized mouse model provided a perfect platform for evaluating immunotherapy against tumor. The earliest attempts of inducing antitumor immune responses in humanized mice focused on the generation of specifi c antibody but the outcome varied due to unstable humanization of models [ 104 , 105 ] . In the new century, researchers started to pay more attention on developing complete tumorigenicity, especially metastasis process and its relationship with stromal cells, in immunocompetent humanized mice, and made some signifi cant advances in multiple fi elds like human prostate cancer [ 106 ], mixed-lineage leukemia [ 109 ] . Based on these progresses, some novel immunotherapy strategies were evaluated on humanized mouse models, such as inhibitory receptor Ig-like transcript (ILT)-3 depletion or blockade in melanoma [ 110 ] and IL-15-enhanced NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against human breast cancer [ 111 ] . Recently, our group reported a novel application of pamidronate, a phosphoantigen generally used to treat osteoporosis, in treating Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced B cell lymphoproliferative disease in humanized mouse model reconstituted with human PBMC [ 112 ] . This \"new application of an old drug\" was mediated by expanding and activating human V\u03b39V\u03b42-T cells, a small cell population of human lymphocytes, which might inspire further exploration of currently available resources. More importantly, the established of donorand tissue-specifi c humanized mouse tumor models will undoubtedly play an indispensable role during the development of individual therapies in the future [ 113 ] .",

The new generation of humanized mice not only improved our understanding on transmission, latency, and pathogenesis of HIV [ 114 -119 ] , but also provided unprecedented platform for antiviral study. Besides further exploration of effi cient virus-specifi c neutralization antibodies [ 120 -125 ] and conventional antiretroviral or antimicrobial therapies [ 126 -128 ] in these models, the effi cacy of vectored immunoprophylaxis [ 129 ] and CCR5-targetd treatment [ 130 -132 ] in preventing HIV transmission were evaluated as well.

Other novel immunotherapy assays performed in humanized mouse model included blockade of programmed cell death (PD)-1 receptor [ 137 , 138 ] , engineering HIV-resistant T cells from short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)-expressing hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells [ 139 ] , and inhibition of HIV replication by a chimera containing an RNA aptamer with high binding affi nity to the HIV envelop protein gp120 and virus neutralization properties and a small interfering RNA (siRNA) triggering sequence-specifi c degradation of HIV RNAs [ 140 ] . Moreover, a preliminary study on mechanisms underlying viral controlling in HLA-B*57 elite controller or suppressor (ES) was completed in humanized BLT mice and demonstrated that elite suppressors are capable of controlling HIV-1 due to the possession of unique host factors rather than infection with defective virus in vivo [ 141 ] .

We demonstrated that aminobisphosphonate can control infl uenza disease through boosting human V\u03b39V\u03b42-T cell immunity and this benefi cial effect is active against viruses of varying subtypes and virulence [ 43 ] . Nevertheless, differences in the characteristics of molecules, tissues, and organs between human and mice might impair effi ciency of pathogen infection and initiation of specifi c immune responses [ 167 ] . In 2005, Lassning et al. increased the susceptibility of mice on human coronavirus by crossing aminopeptidase N (APN), the receptor for human coronavirus (hCoV)-229E, and transgenic mice into signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)-1 null mice [ 168 ] . This work, together with HLA-and human cytokines/growth factor-transgenic technology [ 169 ] , provided successful examples for future studying human infectious agents in humanized mice. In the next stage, improvement of versatility and variability of human immune system in humanized mouse model and application of gene-modifi ed pathogens [ 170 ] will defi nitely enhance translational effi ciency of these models.",

The increasing applications of diverse humanized mice models in biomedical research during the past two decades significantly improved our understanding on human physiological and pathological, especially immunological process at systemic, cellular, and molecular levels. This further accelerated the development of current translational medicine signifi cantly. Nevertheless, there are several major caveats on their development remain to be dealt with, including complete replacement of murine MHC with diversifi ed HLA molecules and effi cient methodology to express corresponding growth factors and cytokines at specifi c time and organs [ 174 ] ; how to prolong the maintenance of human engraftment, promote the development of myeloid cells and increase relatively weak quantity and quality of immune cells [ 175 ] ; and the limited development of lymph nodes, inter-organ traffi c of immune cells, and the reconstitution of red blood cells and granulocytes [ 176 ] . In another word, the most important issue is to fi nd the convenient and cost-effective ways to construct appropriate human-like microenvironment including physical structure, intercellular contact and molecular signals transfer in humanized mice. It is foreseeable that knowledge exchange in the age of big data will bring an even more bright future to this advancing tool than ever. ",

To meet this requirement, Gordon's group fi rstly established a humanized gnotobiotic mice by transplanting fresh or frozen adult human fecal microbial communities into germ-free C57BL/6J mice and then investigated the effect of diet on human gut microbiome [ 100 ]. Similarly, Kashyap et al. determined the relationship among diet, gastrointestinal transit and gut microbiota using the same model [ 101 ], while Macrobal et al. further compared the difference between gnotobiotic humanized mice and conventional mice urine and fecal metabolomics profi les [ 102 ]. Recently, another exciting breakthrough in immune reconstitution of the gastrointestinal tract was reported by Nochi's group. They developed human gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) in mouse cryptopatches and succeeded in generating functional intestinal immunity marked by human IgA secretion in a BLT-NOD/scid mice model [ 103 ]. The combination of this humanized mouse model and gnotobiotics transfer will greatly improve our understanding on intestinal physiology and immune regulation.",

Similar to HLA-transgenic mice, their combination with humanized-immune system in mice will certainly strengthen their translational capability in the future. Humanized liver mice were established as early as 2001 and mainly applied in the study of drug metabolism, excretion, toxicity [ 25 , 26 ], and the in vivo activity of enzymes such as human cytochrome P450 [ 27 ]. Moreover, the establishment of chimeric mice with humanized liver accelerated the progress of the studies in hepatitis virus B [ 28 , 29 ], C [ 30 , 31 ], D [ 32 ], and human cytomegalovirus infection [ 33 ]",
