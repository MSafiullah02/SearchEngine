Without vaccines, the population-particularly children-would be troubled with multitudinous infectious diseases such as diphtheria, scarlet fever, whooping cough, and measles, just to name a few. Vaccines are available against both viral and bacterial infections; they have saved millions of lives and continue to do so. The World Health Organization hopes to have vaccinated all children under a year old against most infectious diseases by 2020. The history of the public's acceptance of vaccines has been a stormy one. Anti-vaccination movements have been active since the creation or development of the smallpox vaccine in the eighteenth century and in government-mandated vaccination until the present. An example of this is the fabricated information spread about the relationship between measles vaccine and autism. A successful polio vaccine was developed in the 1950s thanks to the research of three groups, led by Koprowski, Salk and Sabin, although each of these vaccines has its advantages and disadvantages. An oral vaccine has the advantage of ease of administration and a herd effect. Polio vaccine workers have become targets of extremists in Nigeria and Pakistan. Recently, recombinant DNA technology, was used to develop new vaccines in order to avoid the side effects, since live virus is not involved. The future may see the production of vaccines in edible plants, allowing for cheap production and ease in worldwide distribution.",

Anti-vaccination movements have been active since the introduction of the smallpox vaccine and government-mandated vaccination. In the U.S. and U.K., opponents to vaccination have often been religious. Arguments against variolation, and later vaccination, go back to the eighteenth century, even before Jenner and his discovery of cowpox as protection against smallpox. Preachers pronounced diseases as punishment for sins, and as such should not be treated. A national poll conducted between 2005 and 2010 showed that 60 % of Americans did not want to get flu shots since they worried about side effects and over-vaccination of the population. Recent opposition stems from a report in The Lancet in 1998, linking the measles mumps, and rubella vaccine to the onset of autism. This paper was later withdrawn following the exposure of fabricated data, but the measles vaccine program in the U.K., and to a lesser degree in the U.S., was severely damaged.

To summarize: Dr. Edward Jenner (1749-1823), a practicing physician in Berkeley, England (Gloucestershire), had noted, as had others, that milkmaids appeared to be immune to smallpox. Instead, their hands often had blisters picked up from cows who had developed pocks on their teats, later shown to be caused by the cowpox virus (later called ''vaccinia''). Jenner, who had a small laboratory in the shadows of Berkeley Castle and its torture chambers in Northern England, inoculated a number of children, including his 11-month-old son first with cowpox, and then reported protection against smallpox. Over 100,000 people had been vaccinated worldwide by the year 1800. Most physicians accepted Jenner's vaccine, although there was some resentment against Jenner by other physicians who did not appreciate that the ''cure'' for smallpox was developed by a country physician. Others may have resented the loss of revenue from treating smallpox [1] . In 1802, the British Parliament discussed Jenner's vaccine, upheld its usefulness and his claim that he was the inventor of the method. Despite its success, and its use worldwide, there continued to be opposition to the vaccine.",

Although hard to believe, a girl who had been recently vaccinated was sent to an orphanage in St. Petersburg, Russia, and served as a source of the smallpox vaccine for all the children more than a week old. The orphanage continued this practice from one child to another for 92 years (1801-93) [2] Then there was the Balmis Expedition, the goal of which was to bring the vaccine to the New World and the American Indian population. The King of Spain's daughter had been stricken with smallpox in 1798. In 1803, Charles IV ordered his personal physician, de Balmis, to deliver the vaccine to the inhabitants of North and South America. To maintain the vaccine during its long trip across the Atlantic, de Balmis recruited 22 young boys from orphanages in Spain, ages 3-9, who had never had smallpox. During the trip, de Balmis sequentially vaccinated the boys in a living chain and this was continued until the ship reached Venezuela. More than 100,000 people were thus vaccinated in Latin America. The ''Royal Smallpox Expedition,'' as it was called, then recruited 22 more orphans and continued the vaccination program in the Philippines, Macao and Canton [2] .",

The British government passed the vaccination act in 1840, after a smallpox epidemic from 1837 until 1840, made variolation illegal and supplied smallpox vaccine (cowpox) free of charge. In 1853 the Vaccination Act was passed, requiring all children to receive smallpox vaccines by the age of 4 months; later on, the law was changed to allow parents who objected to vaccination to appeal. This was known as the conscientious objection law, hence the term ''conscientious objector.'' In 1905 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that individual states could impose mandatory vaccination on children.",

Pasteur was an experimental scientist working on the vaccine, but was not allowed by French law to treat patients. Joseph Meister had been mauled by a rabid dog and was brought to Pasteur for help. Pasteur consulted with two physicians, and since there seemed little hope of a cure since rabies is fatal, asked one of the physicians to administer the untested vaccine. Using it on Meister has come into some criticism and controversy in recent years [3] with the release of Pasteur's notebooks. Questions are being asked whether the vaccine was adequately tested before being used in the Meister case, and doubts have been expressed as to whether the boy had been bitten by a rabid dog. Both Pasteur and Roux worked on the vaccine, but Roux's name is not on the paper reporting the treatment of Meister. Some [3] claim that Pasteur lied in his paper, stating that he had treated 40 dogs with the vaccine, when in fact he had just initiated treatment with 20 dogs, and that development of the vaccine was not far enough along to warrant use in humans; there is also speculation that Roux might have opposed the use of the vaccine.",

This was in the days before the modern vaccine, and I was given a series of 12 shots in the abdomen as a precaution (I assume that this must have been the Pasteur vaccine). After the shots the animal tested negative! The number of deaths from rabies in the United States had declined from approximately 100 at the turn of the last century (1900) to one or two per year, and those few cases are due to exposure to wildlife (bats). In the rest of the world, the main source of rabies is still the rabid dog. More than 55,000 people die of rabies each year in Asia and Africa; 40 % of those bitten by suspect rabid animals are children less than 15 years old (WHO report).",

The Rockefeller Institute in New York sent one of its scientists, Hideyo Noguchi, to Guayaquil, Ecuador, a center for epidemic outbreaks, to investigate the possibilities of producing a vaccine. While in Ecuador, Noguchi claimed to have discovered the agent causing yellow fever, a spirochete bacterium, Leptospira icteroides [5] . He went on to develop a vaccine from this organism and used it extensively in South America and Africa. Noguchi published many papers reporting success with his vaccine, in a total of 7,964 cases. However, his results were not reproducible, filters retained the agent he used, indicating that it was not a viral disease, the statistics were faulty, and eventually the Rockefeller Institute dropped the project. This material is also presented in Chap. 10 .",

Noguchi pursued his ideas that the disease was caused by Leptospira icteroides and inoculated over one thousand monkeys with blood from yellow fever victims, but could not find any leptospira in them. Noguchi also contracted yellow fever and died in May 1928, as did a third investigator, who performed the autopsy on him [6] . However, now that an animal model had been discovered, the infecting agent could be removed to the laboratory for further study. Soon after, it was shown that serum from immune humans, who had recovered from the infection, protected monkeys against infection, and immune serum from South American patients protected against the African ''virus'' (thus suggesting that one vaccine would offer protection globally). This strain of yellow fever was called ''Asibi.'' A French group in Dakar also collected blood from another patient, and passaged the ''virus'' in rhesus monkeys. This gave rise to a strain of virus known as the French strain. The virus could be frozen and work now pursued in the laboratory.",

In 1927 he isolated a virus that appeared to be the causative agent of the disease. Being aware of the previous literature on the rabies virus, and on recent work on growing herpes virus in the brain of mice, Theiler inoculated the yellow fever virus into mouse brains and found that it reproduced. When injected into rhesus monkeys, the passaged virus was less pathogenic systemically, but more neurotropic. This research was extremely dangerous. The Rockefeller Institute announced in 1931 that there had been 32 cases of yellow fever in eight laboratories, with five fatalities. The French strain, passaged a hundred more times in mouse brains, was administered to protect laboratory and field workers in 1931. The virus was combined with immune serum from yellow fever-infected lab workers to prevent encephalitis. This vaccine was successful and was used up until World War II. Meanwhile, the French scientists developed a different vaccine, using the mouse brain passaged virus, coating it with oil or egg yolk, freeze-drying the mixture, suspending it in saline, and applying it with the smallpox vaccine by scarification. By 1945, sixteen million Africans had been vaccinated with this combination and with few side effects.",

This virus lost its neurotropism in mice, due to random mutations. This strain, called 17D, had no side effects, and became the vaccine of choice. By 1939, 1.3 million people had been vaccinated in South America with the Theiler vaccine, without any side effects. However, in 1941, 119 cases of encephalitis were reported, all of the infected having received the vaccine from a single lot; this virus had apparently mutated during sub-culture. Thus there arose the ''seed lot'' system, where original cultures of the virus were stored for further use.",

A major advance was the discovery that both poliovirus and mumps virus could grow in mouse lung cells. Three major research groups were involved in the development of a polio vaccine: those of Jonas Salk, Albert Sabin and Hilary Koprowski. Unfortunately, there was bitter competition and rivalry between the three groups. The first vaccine licensed in the U.S. was Salk's inactivated polio vaccine (1955), in which the three strains of poliovirus were inactivated by treatment with formalin. The development of this vaccine was a great achievement, and Jonas Salk became a national hero. A second attenuated vaccine containing all three strains of polio was tested and licensed in 1962. Two other groups had independently produced an attenuated vaccine-one headed by Albert Sabin, the other by Hilary Koprowski. A committee of the National Institutes of Health decided on the Sabin vaccine, which consisted of the three mutated strains of polio, extensively passaged in cell culture and mice. Hilary Koprowski had developed the first attenuated poliovirus in 1950 and tested it on himself and on a group of 20 children in New York, with no side effects. Mass vaccination trials of the Koprowski oral polio vaccine took place in the Belgian Congo, Poland, Croatia, and Switzerland. By 1960, approximately 13 million individuals had been vaccinated with the Koprowski polio vaccine and over 11 million with the Sabin vaccine [7] .",

Initially, the Salk vaccine was the vaccine of choice in the U.S. In 1955, in the largest trial ever held, more than 400,000 children were vaccinated with the Salk vaccine, which was 90 % effective against type II and type III polio, and 60-70 % effective against type I. Large industrial facilities were built for the production of the vaccine, which was exported to many countries. In 1955, in an event known as the ''Cutter'' (Cutter was the name of one of the pharmaceutical companies that produced the polio vaccine), some 120,000 doses of the Salk vaccine were created, containing a live poliovirus instead of an inactive one. The administration of this vaccine caused 40,000 cases of polio, with 53 cases of paralysis and 5 deaths. The disease spread, creating a polio epidemic that lead to a further 113 cases of paralytic polio and another 5 deaths. It has been called ''one of the worst pharmaceutical disasters in U.S. history;'' [8] it of course affected the public's attitude towards the vaccine. In order for a vaccine to be successful, the public has to have confidence in it. In fact, the ''Cutter Incident'' led to the use of an alternative vaccine (Sabin instead of Salk) for some time.",

It was also assumed that the immunity from the inactivated vaccine would not be long lasting, whereas the Sabin vaccine virus multiplied in the gut, and would confer a stronger immune response. By 1968 the Sabin vaccine replaced the Salk vaccine. Since it was given orally rather than by injection, it was easier for children to take and for parents to administer. However there was a low, but steady number of individuals receiving the vaccine who developed paralytic polio, indicating that the attenuated virus had undergone mutation, or reverted to wild-type. By 2000 the US CDC recommended the Salk, inactivated vaccine. In the WHO campaign to eradicate polio, the oral vaccine is preferred, because of herd immunity. A map of the areas of the globe with endemic polio is shown in Fig. 19 .2 (a newer map would include Syria).",

This was based on a study headed by Dr. Andrew Wakefield, a British surgeon and specialist in diseases of the gastric tract. In particular, he claimed to have found a correlation between irritable bowel syndrome, autism and the vaccine. His conclusions were based on a study of 12 children. Most of the data presented in the paper was anecdotal, on information from the parents as to when the autistic symptoms first appeared. In most cases this was said to have been within a few weeks of the MMR inoculation. Dr. Wakefield published a follow-up series of papers [10] [11] [12] claiming a direct relationship between the vaccine and autism (and irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn's disease). The papers were peerreviewed, many appearing in The Lancet or other influential peer-reviewed journals. The major argument presented was that (1) the vaccine overloaded the immune system with viruses (three types), leading to an abnormal immune response; (2) the injection of measles virus at such a young age altered the normal immune response, resulting in aberrations of the immune system; and (3) that lack of natural exposure to these viruses could lead to irritable bowel syndrome and Crohn's disease, both autoimmune diseases (although also known to be inherited). These reports caused an uproar in the U.K., resulting in many parents refusing to vaccinate their children; the effects were such that the level of MMR vaccination dropped from 93 to 73 % in the U.K., and to 50 % in London.",

''Despite the paper claiming that all 12 children were ''previously normal,'' five had documented pre-existing developmental concerns.'' ''Some children were reported to have experienced first behavioral symptoms within days of MMR, but the records documented these as starting some months after vaccination.'' ''In nine cases, unremarkable colonic histopathology results-noting no or minimal fluctuations in inflammatory cell populations-were changed after a medical school 'research review' to 'non-specific colitis'.'' ''The parents of eight children were reported as blaming MMR, but 11 families made this allegation at the hospital. The exclusion of three allegations-all giving times to the onset of problems in months-helped to create the appearance of a 14 day temporal link.",

The WHO, extrapolating from these numbers, estimates that there are 1 billion cases of influenza annually, with 3-5 million severe cases and 300,000-500,000 deaths. Most of the deaths in the U.S. are in the over-65 age group [11] . Chapter 11 presents the biological aspects of the influenza virus. The major antigenic components of the virus are the hemagglutinin protein and the neuraminidase protein, the major surface proteins of the virus. As discussed in Chap. 11, the virus undergoes random mutation at a high rate, resulting in antigenic drift. Reassortment and even mixing in the case of two viruses of different origins results in antigenic shift, making it difficult to predict the makeup of the virus causing the seasonal outbreak of the flu. The result of the antigenic changes may mean that a population has no immunity to the virus, and infection can result in a pandemic, as happened in 1918. The vaccine has to be ''predictive'' from year to year.",

One, containing inactivated subunits of the virus, is given intramuscularly or intradermally; the second is a live vaccine (LIAV live attenuated influenza vaccine) and is given intranasally. Both vaccines are trivalent-that is, have three species of influenza virus in the vaccine. A live attenuated cold adapted influenza virus can be administered as a nasal vaccine. FluMist contains three cold-adapted H1N1, H3N2, and B influenza. These are recombinant viruses containing a backbone of a virus grown in the cold, with the incorporation of H and N genes from different sources, and also influenza B. Mean shedding of the virus is for 7-8 days and longer in children, thus having a herd effect. There have been no cases of illness from this vaccine in the USA. The strains for the next year's vaccine are chosen in February for use in the following season, and vaccine production begins with strains carrying the ''drifted'' HA and NA genes of the last season combined with reference strains that grow well in chick eggs. New methods of producing vaccines, in which reverse genetics is used to copy genes, which are inserted into plasmids, and then cloned back into a reference strains of influenza have been developed. New technologies are required to produce sufficient influenza vaccines, and some are already being tried in various companies. These include cell-based rather than egg-based live attenuated and inactive viral vaccines as well as recombinant protein vaccines, where the genes for HA and NA are cloned into baculovirus vectors and administered as purified proteins. Influenza virus gene can also be cloned into other viral vectors such as vaccinia virus or adenovirus and administered as either a replication-competent virus or defective virus (Fig. 19.4) . However, this creates problems discussed in the chapter on gene therapy, where antibodies may inactivate such a virus. The development of an influenza vaccine is to some extent a ''guessing game,'' since one cannot predict the appearance of a novel strain of virus. ",

The majority of those discussed above are live virus vaccines in which the virus has been attenuated either by multiple passages through other animals or through multiple passages through cells in culture. During passage, the virus undergoes mutation (particularly if it is an RNA virus) at a very high rate, and the virus emerging is often attenuated. It should be possible to rationally design mutations by in vitro mutagenesis. Influenza vaccines are made by adapting the virus to grow at lower temperatures and could be made by performing re-assortment in the laboratory to make attenuated strains (although recombination in the laboratory might also produce viruses that are more pathogenic). Another approach is to make recombinant vaccines using viral genes produced in bacteria, yeast or baculovirus systems.",

It sounds like science fiction, yet experimental trials of producing viral antigens are under way, both in the research laboratory and in biotech companies, by introducing animal viral genes into the plant genome, and into chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are small organelles of prokaryotic origin that are responsible for photosynthesis in green plants, analogous to mitochondria in higher organisms. Plant-derived vaccines (or other biopharmaceuticals) are cheap to produce (compared to cell culture) and to store, easy to scale up for mass production, and safer than those produced from other sources, since there is less likelihood of contamination by bacteria or even other viruses. Plant systems are much more economical than other industrial systems for producing vaccines and would be ideal for Third World countries. For example, it is estimated that to produce 100 million doses of influenza vaccine by a conventional pharmaceutical company, such as Sanofi in Pennsylvania, would cost $150 million per year. If Novartis were to produce 300 million doses, they would charge $100 billion. Using tobacco plants, the cost would be $15 million per year to produce one billion doses [14] . The technology is already available for the purification, if necessary, of the products, although the ultimate aim might be to digest the vaccine (oral vaccine), despite the fact that precautions need to be taken that the vaccine is not itself digested by stomach enzymes (this obviously does not apply to tobacco plants). To date, the yield of products in experimental systems such as tobacco or lettuce or grains has not been as great as expected; however, the yield can be greatly enhanced by cloning the desired viral genes into chloroplasts, which multiply in large numbers in the plant cell, thus enriching the product. An HSV-2 vaccine has been produced in soybeans using a cauliflower mosaic virus promoter [15] . This antibody was effective in preventing HSV-2 infection in a mouse model and was indistinguishable from a monoclonal antibody produced in cell culture. A whole series of monoclonal antibodies have been produced in a variety of plants using plant virus vectors [16] . The hepatitis B envelope protein has been produced in potatoes, lettuce, and lupines, and was immunogenic when digested orally. The Norwalk virus capsid protein was also produced in potatoes and tobacco plants and was immunogenic. The protein produced resembled empty viral capsids (Table 19.5) .",

It is estimated that the yield should be around 1 % of the total weight to make it of practical use. The yield can be increased by using chloroplasts. There can be upto 10,000 copies of chloroplasts per cell and result in the accumulation of 47 % of the total protein being the recombinant protein. The desired genes are incorporated into the chloroplast by recombination. Thus the cloned gene is surrounded on both sides by chloroplast sequences. The method of transformation is quite different from that of animal cells. Four-to six-week-old leaves are selected for transformation; DNA is coated on the surface of microparticles of gold or tungsten and then shot onto the leaf surface with great force, using a helium-driven particle delivery device (gene gun).",

However, the product has not yet reached human clinical trials, although there has been a large investment by U.S. government agencies.

Then a vacuum is applied by drawing the air from the water and the plants. As soon as we switch off the vacuum, the plants suck in the water together with the vector. This takes just a few seconds, and then the plants are put back in the growth module to grow further. In about a week they have produced the proteins.
