Usually, by the time a patient is scheduled for a biopsy, the most common fi nding is the organizing pneumonia which will be discussed later under the acute lung injury pattern. Viral pneumonia could present in different ways. Adenovirus infection could be subtle and shows only as dark smudgy nuclei in the alveolar lining or with viral cytopathic effect showing ground-glass nuclei. On the other hand, infl uenza virus and herpes simplex virus (HSV) tend to cause areas of necrosis and some neutrophilic infi ltrate similar to that of bacterial pneumonia. The clue to the viral etiology would be based on the presence of viral cytopathic changes with nuclear inclusions in case of the HSV and groundglass nuclei in the infl uenza virus. These fi ndings could be present in the background of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and recognizing the viral etiology or other etiologies in general is important in the treatment of these cases. Cytomegalovirus induces only chronic infl ammation and is characterized by the enlarged cells with basophilic nuclear inclusions. The virus usually infects alveolar lining cells and endothelial cells.",

The other entity is bronchiolitis obliterans/organizing pneumonia (BOOP) with its idiopathic variant called cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) [ 2 ] . There is a substantial overlap in the histomorphologic features between BOOP and DAD. In both of these entities, there are commonly: 1. Thickening of the interalveolar septa with mild chronic infl ammatory infi ltrate and fi broblastic proliferation. The septa could also demonstrate intercellular edema exaggerating the thickness of the septa and making it appear as a reticular pattern. 2. Proliferation of type II pneumocytes lining the alveolar spaces. 3. Proliferation of the fi broblasts forming polypoid and fascicular bundles fi lling up the alveolar spaces to be called \"fi broblastic plugs.\" The latter could plug the alveolar air spaces or the bronchial lumens. The lung will turn into a consolidated mass with sporadic air spaces in predominantly fi broelastic mass comprised by the thick septa and fi broblastic plugs [ 3 ] . This in turn hinders gas diffusion and hence results in the shortness of breath and hypoxia when measuring blood gases.",

In addition, BOOP could be present around mass lesions in the lung such as tumors or granulomas.

The mere presence of blood within the biopsy is not enough evidence for intraalveolar hemorrhage as blood from the biopsy procedure is usually the culprit for such hemorrhage. Intra-alveolar hemorrhage in its primary form is a diffuse process involving all areas of the lung. The potential etiology is usually an autoimmune disease such as Goodpasture syndrome [ 11 ] . In this case a small portion of the biopsy should be snap frozen for immunofl uorescence studies. Other common causes would include vasculitides such as capillaritis syndrome in microscopic polyangiitis and Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Other primary diseases are associated with toxic inhalants and drugs. An idiopathic form also exists.",

The secondary form (5-10 % of cases) is mainly due to inhalational exposure to industrial material such as silica, cement dust, aluminum, or titanium oxide. The rare congenital form affects children in the neonatal period. There is a controversy as whether it is a true PAP condition; however, the prognosis is invariably poor. The etiology of the primary type is poorly understood. It is thought to be a mutation that affects the function of GM-CSF, an important factor in surfactant homeostasis and an essential regulator in immune defense [ 12 ] . An increased level of GM-CSF autoantibodies was found in patients with primary PAP. Most patients present with dyspnea and nonproductive cough.
