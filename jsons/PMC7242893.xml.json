The goals of this study were to identify PBMCs miRNAs profiles in Indian water buffalo associated with economically devastating diseases, namely, brucellosis and paratuberculosis (Johne\u2019s disease or JD). Brucellosis an important zoonotic disease of livestock is caused by facultative, gram-negative bacteria of Brucella genus. This intracellular organism generally enters the host via the nasal and oral routes followed by invasion and proliferation within monocytic phagocytes [5]. It spreads via macrophages to the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, bone marrow, mammary glands, and reproductive organs. Another important disease that has been encountered in dairy animals is the paratuberculosis (Johne\u2019s disease or JD) caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP). Calves mainly acquire the infection through oral route by uptake of MAP via colostrum, milk or feed contaminated with fecal matter [6] or via intrauterine route [7]. Following the invasion, the bacteria primarily resides in the mucosal tissues of gut and its associated lymph nodes and spreads to bloodstream, milk and other peripheral tissues [8]. MAP being an obligate intracellular pathogen resides in host macrophages and enhance its survival by inhibiting intracellular phagosomal activation and maturation [9, 10]. Thus, Brucellosis and JD, causes substantial economic losses to livestock worldwide and hence scientific research has been focused on their diagnosis, prevention, and control.",

Further, infection with M. paratuberculosis is shown to be associated with upregulated expression of genes (Bad, CIDE-A, Fas, TNFRI) responsible for promoting apoptosis as well as genes (tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2) having role in modeling extracellular matrix and tissue [23]. Additionally, natural infection of cattle with M. avium paratuberculosis (MAP) resulted in upregulated expression of the CD40 receptor and its ligand in PBMC [24].",

Therefore, corroborating the possiblity that other intracellular mycobacterial and Gram-negative bacterial infections including Johne\u2019s disease and Brucellosis of cattle may also alter the miRNA profiles of PBMCs. Very limited reports are available on the bubaline miRNA repertoire in context to disease. Only one such recent study characterized the serum and vaginal fluids miRNAs involved in Brucella infection in water buffaloes and implicated its use as potential disease prognostic biomarkers [29].

The real-time expression of the four selected miRNAs viz. bta-miR-9-5p, bta-miR-677, bta-miR-331-3p, and bta-miR-2440 were analyzed and normalized against endogenous control BbuRNU6. Two target genes for each of the above-selected four miRNAs, i.e. 8 target genes, were analyzed and gene expression was normalized against two endogenous controls: GAPDH and beta-actin and represented as fold change in diseased vs. control group. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences (*p < 0.05) in diseased vs. healthy control group. The table indicating P values is included in the figure",
