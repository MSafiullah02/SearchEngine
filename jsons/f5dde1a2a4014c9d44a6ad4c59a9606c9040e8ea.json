Myeloid cells such as neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages are major innate leukocytes that orchestrate protective immunity to viral lung infections. However, a dysregulated cytokine response can promote excessive infiltration and robust pro-inflammatory activity of neutrophils and monocytemacrophages, leading to fatal disease. Following virus infection, the beneficial or deleterious role of infiltrating neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages is determined largely by their ability to secrete inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. A majority of studies use the total number of infiltrating cells and their activation status as measures to demonstrate their role during an infection. Consequently, the ability of neutrophils and Inflammatory Monocyte Macrophages (IMMs) to secrete inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and its correlation with the disease severity, is not well defined. In this chapter, we report useful markers to identify lung infiltrating innate immune cells and define their activation status. We also describe a simple method to measure intracellular cytokine production to evaluate the inflammatory activity of neutrophils and IMMs in a mouse model of human coronavirus infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Myeloid cells such as neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages are key immune cells that make up a large proportion of tissue infiltrating innate leukocytes following a pathogen challenge. Both neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes-macrophages (IMMs) are rapidly recruited to the site of infection and play crucial roles in the host defense against viral lung infections [1, 2] . The antiviral functions of neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages are facilitated following the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by the cell surface and endosomal toll-like receptors (TLRs) and intracellular RIG-I like (RLRs) and Nod-like receptors (NLRs). Detection of viral PAMPs (viral proteins and nucleic acids) by these sensors leads to the activation of a cascade of signaling events resulting in the production of antiviral molecules like interferons (IFNs), interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [3] [4] [5] . IMMs and neutrophils also participate in the phagocytosis of virus-infected cells and orchestrate effective adaptive T cell responses, both of which are essential for effective virus clearance [6] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 368, "end": 371, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 372, "end": 374, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 949, "end": 952, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 953, "end": 956, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 957, "end": 960, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1156, "end": 1159, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In addition to host protective function of myeloid cells during viral lung infections, several recent studies demonstrate their role in mediating cytokine storm and thus exacerbating the host immune response to virus infections [2, 7] . The deleterious functions of neutrophils and IMMs are linked to dysregulated type I IFN (IFN-I) responses, particularly during high pathogenic virus infections [8, 9] . For example, while a controlled neutrophil response is protective during influenza A virus infection, an excessive neutrophil accumulation is detrimental [10, 11] . Similarly, an exaggerated monocyte-macrophage response resulting from delayed IFN-I signaling is detrimental during human coronavirus infections [8] . IMMs and neutrophils also express increased levels of death receptors such as DR5 and FAS, and the interaction of these receptors with their ligands TRAIL and FASL, respectively, promotes airway epithelial and lung microvascular endothelial cell death [9, 12, 13] . Additionally, excessive inflammatory cytokines and chemokines produced by IMMs and neutrophils impair antiviral T cell responses, leading to ineffective virus clearance and reduced survival [8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 228, "end": 231, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 232, "end": 234, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 397, "end": 400, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 401, "end": 403, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 560, "end": 564, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 565, "end": 568, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 716, "end": 719, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 974, "end": 977, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 978, "end": 981, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 982, "end": 985, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1178, "end": 1181, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "A majority of the studies demonstrating the beneficial or detrimental effects of neutrophils and IMMs during viral lung infections enumerate percentages and total number and define activation status of the lung infiltrating myeloid cells using surface markers [14] .
