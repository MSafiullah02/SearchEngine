Molecular diagnosis is most appropriate for infectious agents that are difficult to detect, identify, or test for susceptibility in a timely fashion with conventional methods. During the last 10 years, the detection of infectious disease agents has begun to include the use of nucleic acid-based technologies. Diagnosis of infection caused by parasitic organisms is the last field of clinical microbiology to incorporate these techniques and molecular techniques (e.g., PCR and hybridization assays) have recently been developed for the detection, species differentiation, and phylogenetic analysis.",

Most direct probe detection assays require at least 10 4 copies of nucleic acid per microliter for reliable detection, a requirement rarely met in clinical samples without some form of amplification. Amplification of the detection signal after probe hybridization improves sensitivity to as low as 500 gene copies per microliter and provides quantitative capabilities. This approach has been used extensively for quantitative assays of viral load (HIV, hepatitis B virus [HBV] and hepatitis C virus [HCV] ) (Table 19 .1) but does not match the analytical sensitivity of target amplification-based methods, such as polymerase chain reaction, for detecting organisms. The commercial probe systems that use solution-phase hybridization and chemiluminescence for direct detection of infectious agents in clinical material include the PACE2 products of Gen-Probe and the hybrid capture assay systems of Digene and Murex (Table 19 .1). These systems are user friendly, have a long shelf life, and are adaptable to small or large numbers of specimens. The PACE2 products are designed for direct detection of both Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis in a single specimen (one specimen, two separate probes). The hybrid capture systems detect human papilloma virus (HPV) in cervical scrapings (Ciotti et al., 2004) , herpes simplex virus (HSV) in vesicle material, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) in blood and other fluids (Cinque et al., 1995) .

In choosing a molecular diagnostic system, one should consider the range of tests available, suitability of the method to workflow, and cost. Choosing one amplification-based method that provides testing capabilities for several pathogens is certainly practical. Amplification-based methods are also valuable for identifying cultured and noncultivatable organisms.

Molecular methods for resistance detection (Table 19 .3) may be applied directly to the clinical specimen, providing simultaneous detection and identification of the pathogen plus resistance characterization. Likewise, they are useful in detecting resistance in viruses, slow-growing or nonviable organisms, or organisms with resistance mechanisms that are not reliably detected by phenotypic methods. However, because of their high specificity, molecular methods will not detect newly emerging resistance mechanisms and are unlikely to be useful in detecting resistance genes in species where the gene has not been observed previously. Furthermore, the presence of a resistance gene does not mean that the gene will be expressed, and the absence of a known resistance gene does not exclude the possibility of resistance from another mechanism. Phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods allow laboratories to test many organisms and detect newly emerging as well as established resistance patterns. (1997). b mecA encodes for the altered penicillin binding protein PBP2a ; phenotypic methods may require 48 h incubation or more to detect resistance and are less than 100% sensitive. Detection of mecA has potential for clinical application in specific circumstances. c Vancomycin resistance in enterococci may be related to one of four distinct resistance genotypes of which vanA and vanB are most important. Genotypic detection of resistance is useful in validation of phenotypic methods. d The genetic basis of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics is extremely complex. The bla TEM and bla SHV genes are the two most common sets of plasmid encoded beta-lactamases. The presence of either a bla TEM or bla SHV gene implies ampicillin resistance. Variants of the bla TEM and bla SHV genes (extended spectrum beta-lactamases) may also encode for resistance to a range of thirdgeneration cephalosporins and to monobactams. e M. tuberculos is very slow growing. Four weeks or more may be required to obtain phenotypic susceptibility test results. Detection of resistance genes in M. tuberculosis has potential for clinical application in the short term. f There are no phenotypic methods sufficiently practical for routine clinical detection of resistance to antiviral agents. Genotypic methods represent a practical method for routine detection of antiviral resistance. g Abbreviations not defined in text: RFLP, restriction fragment length polymorphism; SSCP, single-stranded conformational polymorphism; LIPA, line probe assay; TK, thymidine kinase; RT, reverse transcriptase; PROT, protease.",

The gold standard in bacteriology largely remains culture, primarily due to cost accounting and the potential complex nature of associated infections (i.e., urine, wound, and respiratory cultures). However, in circumstances in which there may be minute quantities of a specific pathogen present, the patient may have received antibiotics prior to specimen collection or the etiologic agent may require unusual culture conditions, molecular detection offers a great advantage to culture techniques. In many virology laboratories, molecular detection has supplanted cell culture techniques for the identification of several viral pathogens and in many cases has become the new gold standard. Though molecular techniques can offer an abundance of added benefits when used to augment current gold standards such as culture and/or serology, the optimal use of molecular methodologies in microbiology resides with specimens in which a limited number of pathogenic organisms are sought and in cases where the enhanced sensitivity and faster turnaround time of molecular methods far outweighs the increased cost.",

The use of sensitive and specific laboratory methods for diagnosing this condition is crucial to reduce the transmission and sequelae of STI. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis are the pathogens most frequently involved in urethral and cervical infection. Culture continues to be the gold standard for diagnosing gonorrhea. Nucleic acid amplification assays are considered the new gold standard for C. trachomatis, although culture is till the most specific technique. Genital ulcers due to Treponema pallidum, Haemophilus ducreyi, or herpes simplex virus have little clinical and bacteriological correlation; therefore, it is essential to establish the microbiological diagnosis. Lesions present in the primary or secondary period of syphilis can be diagnosed by dark field microscopy. Serologic diagnosis for the remaining periods is based on non-treponemal tests associated with confirmatory treponemal tests. Cell culture is considered the gold standard for herpes simplex virus although molecular methods also have a sensitivity and specificity near 100%. Currently, microbiologic diagnosis of H. ducreyi and venereal lymphogranuloma is achieved with the use of molecular methods on samples obtained from the ulceration or lymph adenopathy. The diagnosis of genital warts in immunocompetent patients is based on clinical findings in most cases because the lesions are sufficiently characteristic. Culture is considered the reference method in Trichomonas vaginalis infection (V\u00e1zquez et al., 2008) .",

The rapid, nonculture techniques for direct detection of Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and herpes simplex virus are reviewed, and their advantages and disadvantages are compared with conventional diagnostic methods (Woods, 1995) . Polymerase chain reaction tests were performed on specimens from consecutive male patients with genital ulcers to detect sexually transmitted pathogens. PCR was also performed for the detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Trichomonas vaginalis on urethral specimens from consecutive subjects with dysuria or urethral discharge. Antibody tests for syphilis and Herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2) and human immunodeficiency virus antibodies were performed. Men at risk of genital ulcers should be asked about relevant symptoms with and without prompting and examined clinically to maximize the likelihood of correct diagnosis and treatment. The finding of a high prevalence of HSV-2 and associated dysuria cautions against providing empirical treatment for gonorrhoea and chlamydia in ulcer patients with dysuria but without urethral discharge. Innovative strategies to limit the burden of HSV-2 infection in this population are required (O'Farrell et al., 2008) .",

Therefore, accurate, cost-effective, reliable diagnostic assays (preferably those which can be used in the field) are needed to impact on the incidence of the various STIs, as well as HIV. With the advent of molecular technologies, including target and signal amplification methods, diagnoses of STIs have been revolutionised and allow the use of non or minimally invasive sampling techniques, some of which are self-collected by the patient, e.g. first-void urine, cervico-vaginal lavage, low vaginal swabs, and tampons. Most studies evaluating such self-sampling with molecular diagnostic techniques have demonstrated an equivalent or superior detection of STIs as compared to conventional sampling and detection methods. These sampling methods can also be used to determine prevalence of STIs in various populations, but particularly those with difficult access to medical care (Garland and Tabrizi, 2004) .",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recommended confirmation of positive NAAT results in low-prevalence populations. APTIMA CT (ACT) and APTIMA GC (AGC) are two discrete NAATs for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae detection that are suitable for confirming AC2positive results because they target different nucleic acid sequences. Thus, ACT and AGC relative sensitivity compared to that of AC2 was 100%. All APTIMA assays detected more confirmed positive results than culture, DFA, and LCx. The performance of APTIMA assays was not altered by the use of various swab types and by long-term storage of specimens. All APTIMA assays are highly sensitive and rapid.

Cell culture techniques are insensitive due to the low viral burden typically found associated with encephalitis and perhaps also the presence of host neutralizing antibodies. CSF culture for HSV detects less than 2% of clinically determined adult HSV encephalitis cases and 40% of neonatal central nervous system (CNS) disease. In contrast, HSV NAA is positive in most adult cases resulting in sensitivity and specificity > 95% and is 75% sensitive and 100% specific for neonatal meningitis. The rapid diagnosis of HSV encephalitis can prevent a brain biopsy and rapidly determine the need for acyclovir therapy. Enterovirus is the most common cause of aseptic meningitis in the summer and fall months in temperate climates and accounts for 10-20% of encephalitis cases. Nucleic acid amplification has also been successfully applied to other etiologies of viral CNS disease, such as CMV and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), but these assays have not been implemented as broadly as those for HSV and EV, so are still transitioning to becoming the method of choice. It should be noted that not all encephalitis viruses are readily detected by NAA. For example, due to the short period of viremia in many carboviral infections (i.e., West Nile Virus), CSF NAA has low sensitivity, and the gold standard remains serology. CSF NAA false negative results can occur due to collection of CSF very early or very late in illness, rapid viral clearance in immunocompetent hosts, and NAA inhibitors. False positive CSF NAA results also occur primarily due to lack of data to suggest the detection of certain viral nucleic acids correlates with clinical CNS disease, but can also be caused by the presence of peripheral blood in the CSF. While CSF NAA is considered by many the diagnostic standard of care as discussed above, the lack of standardized FDA-approved assays has made implementation of CSF NAA difficult in nonacademic settings.

Apart from these certain non-immunological tests viz. Limulus amoebecyte lysate test, gas liquid chromatography, nitroblue tetrazolium dye reduction test have also been evaluated to make the laboratory diagnosis of this important clinical entity rapid and more reliable (Ichhpujani and Bhatia, 1984) The tuberculin skin test for immunologic diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection has many limitations, including being confounded by Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination or exposure to nontuberculous mycobacteria. M. tuberculosis-specific antigens that are absent from BCG and most nontuberculous mycobacteria have been identified .

It should be noted that NAA of MTB does not replace the need for routine mycobacterial culture and susceptibility testing. In addition to the direct detection of MTB, techniques such as probe-based technology and sequence analysis can be applied to cultured isolates to decrease the time to identification over routine biochemical analysis. Rapid identification of MTB impacts not only patient care, but also infection control. Due to the increasing frequency of isolation of mycobacterial species associated with immunocompromised hosts and the increased incidence of multi-drug resistant MTB, it has become imperative to offer accurate yet rapid diagnostic tools for the detection and identification of mycobacteria . A debate exists regarding the gold standard for the laboratory diagnosis of Bordetella pertussis. Historically, culture plates collected at the patient's bedside (i.e., cough plates) have been considered the reference method. Although culture is very specific, its sensitivity suffers partially due to the organism's fastidious nature, but primarily because the highest sensitivity for culture occurs before patients are symptomatic. NAA remains positive for longer after therapy than culture, and NAA is also positive for a longer period after onset of symptoms. Therefore, NAA is useful for patients presenting later in their illness. NAA testing allows for same-day results and since erythromycin-resistant B. pertussis is still rare, a cultured isolate is rarely needed for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Multiple studies have demonstrated significant increased detection of B. pertussis when comparing NAA to culture: reported PCR-positive, culture-negative samples range from 13 to 88%. However, due to potential false positive and false negative results with B. pertussis NAA procedures, it is strongly recommended that results be considered in the context of patient clinical presentation, and clinically inconsistent results should be confirmed by a second method.",

Since antimicrobial resistance can be multi-factorial, this practice is limited to organisms in which the results can be interpreted with confidence in regard to the genotypic relationship to clinical treatment and/or infection control precautions. Such examples are direct detection of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) from rectal and nares surveillance cultures, respectively. Screening patients for VRE and MRSA carriage is a key strategy for preventing the spread of these organisms in health care settings. NAA technology reportedly increases VRE detection by up to 120%. In addition, enterococci that confer low-level intrinsic resistance, and thus not considered \"true\" VRE, are accurately ruled out preventing unnecessary contact precautions and contributing to hospital savings. NAA detection of MRSA has been shown to be equal in sensitivity to culture-based methods, but has the advantage of offering a faster turnaround time, thus impacting hospital cost savings. However, it should be noted that direct specimen testing for MRSA comes with limitations, often including a lower positive predictive value than conventional methods. More recently, new strains of MRSA have appeared that are associated with skin and soft tissue infections in outpatients and are called community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA). The increasing incidence of CA-MRSA is causing overall rates of MRSA to rise. Therefore, it has become even more important to quickly and accurately identify resistant isolates.",

Several different epidemiologic typing methods have been applied in studies of microbial pathogens (Table 19 .4). The phenotypic methods have occasionally been useful in describing the epidemiology of infectious diseases; however, they are too variable, slow, and labor-intensive to be of much use in most epidemiologic investigations. Newer DNA-based typing methods have eliminated most of these limitations and are now the preferred techniques for epidemiologic typing. The most widely used molecular typing methods include plasmid profiling, restriction endonuclease analysis of plasmid and genomic DNA, Southern hybridization analysis using specific DNA probes, and chromosomal DNA profiling using either pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) or PCR-based methods. All these methods use electric fields to separate DNA fragments, whole chromosomes, or plasmids into unique patterns or fingerprints that are visualized by staining with ethidium bromide or by nucleic acid probe hybridization. Molecular typing is performed to determine whether different isolates give the same or different results for one or more tests. Epidemiologically related isolates share the same DNA profile or fingerprint, whereas sporadic or epidemiologically unrelated isolates have distinctly different patterns. If isolates from different patients share the same fingerprint, they probably originated from the same clone and were transmitted from patient to patient by a common source or mechanism. Molecular typing methods have allowed investigators to study the relationship between colonizing and infecting isolates in individual patients, distinguish contaminating from infecting strains, document nosocomial transmission in hospitalized patients, evaluate reinfection versus relapse in patients being treated for an infection, and follow the spread of antimicrobial-drug resistant strains within and between hospitals over time. Most available DNA-based typing methods may be used in studying nosocomial infections when applied in the context of a careful epidemiologic investigation. In contrast, even the most powerful and sophisticated typing method, if used indiscriminately in the absence of sound epidemiologic data, may provide conflicting and confusing information.",

The implementation of user-defined NAA testing has revolutionized clinical molecular infectious disease testing. In addition, commercially-available non-FDA-approved NAA assays are increasingly becoming available as analyte specific reagents (ASRs). Though all reagents necessary for the amplification reaction can be purchased commercially, assay development and verification studies must be performed by individual laboratories. In many cases, there are no comparative studies between user-defined NAA procedures, including ASRs, limiting the comparative value of assays between institutions (particularly in viral load monitoring) and restricting the application of such procedures to more experienced laboratories. It is not without considerable cost that a molecular infectious disease diagnostic lab is developed. It represents an institutional commitment because the costs may only be offset when analysis of hospital-wide cost savings is employed (i.e. shorter hospital stays, decreased use of unncecessary antibiotics). The costs incurred not only stem from instrumentation purchases, but also from the dedicated, expert staff required for such testing. Since many academic medical centers have resorted to implementing user-defined assays, verification and validation studies are substantial and require extensive resources, including time, staff, and expertise. These studies are crucial to defining the performance of the assay and determining appropriate clinical utilization.
