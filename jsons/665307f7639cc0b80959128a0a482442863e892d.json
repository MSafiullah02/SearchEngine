            "text": "Kawasaki disease (KD) is a multisystem vasculitis that primarily affects the coronary arteries of young children. A number of epidemiological and clinical observations suggest that KD is caused by an infectious agent, with suggestions ranging from Staphylococci, Streptococci, Mycoplasma or Chlamydia, [1] [2] [3] [4] to viruses such as adenovirus, parvovirus or Epstein-Barr virus. [5] [6] [7] However, no single causative pathogen has been consistently demonstrated 8 in the nasopharynx, oropharynx, skin, or faeces of patients with KD. 9, 10 Internal tissues of the airway or of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract may also be entry or colonization sites of the potential causative agents, but these have not been investigated in detail. Intense interest has recently centered on novel human coronavirus messenger RNA (mRNA) detected in the respiratory secretions of some children with KD; 11 however, other investigators have not been able to confirm this finding. 12, 13 We have hypothesized that the mucosa of the upper GI tract could be involved in KD because of the role of the GI tract as an immunological organ constantly exposed to microorganisms and other agents. We have previously observed increased numbers of CD4 + T cells and human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DR + cells, and fewer CD8 + T cells, in the gut of patients with KD compared with controls. 14 Consequently, we carried out a microbiologic investigation of the small intestine and showed that the range of bacterial species adhering to the lumen of the jejunum of patients with KD was quite different from that of controls. 15 Notably, five strains of Streptococci and two strains of Staphylococci [both species are known to be common sources of superantigen (sAg)] were isolated only from KD patients. We have also investigated T-cellreceptor (TCR) Vb2 expression in the small intestinal I M M U N O L O G Y O R I G I N A L A R T I C L E mucosa of KD patients 14 and found that these cells were selectively increased in the mucosa of patients in the acute phase of KD compared with controls.",

[27] [28] [29] [30] Although the debate continues regarding the mechanism of initial immune activation, the most likely scenario is that sAg and conventional peptide antigens work together to direct a persistent immune response leading to coronary artery damage. 26 A unifying model proposed that a microbe with superantigenic activity initiates massive activation of the developing immune system. A subpopulation of sAgresponsive T cells is rescued from apoptosis as a result of interaction with costimulatory signals between antigenpresenting cells and a conventional peptide antigen. This peptide antigen may be derived from itself or an infectious mimic of itself. The immune response is perpetuated locally where the self-antigen is found on the coronary vessels.",

One may be concerned with the description of S. oralis, S. sanguinis and S. mitis as superantigenic strains because they are generally not known as superantigenic strains. Very few reports on the sAg activity of S. mitis have been published, 31, 32 and sAg activity for S. oralis and S. sanguinis has not yet been confirmed, except for some interesting findings suggesting the possibilities of toxic shock-like syndrome caused by viridans streptococci to which those strains belong and sAg-related toxigenic conversion between streptococcus species. 33, 34 However, these findings did not directly support the production of sAg by those strains. Further investigations in this respect are obviously required. Autologous PBMCs may be problematic because T cells bearing a certain TCR would be stimulated in an oligoclonal manner and would eventually become anergic. However, we demonstrated that PBMCs obtained from patients during the convalescent phase of KD had the capacity to respond to sAg, probably because some T-cell subsets bearing Tb2 were not anergized or the T cells had never been exposed to sAg in these young children. The reason why the IFN-c and TNF-a production induced by BCS containing sAg was not markedly higher than that induced by BCS without sAg may be explained likewise in that a handful of T cells which respond to sAg in the convalescent sample could produce moderately high amounts of those cytokines.",

[14] [15] [16] The agents demonstrated here are rich in variety, consistent with our hypothesis that many different agents may be related to the onset of KD. Based on our findings in this study, the most likely candidates for bacteria associated with the pathogenesis might be Gram-negative microbes, such as N. mucosa, in cooperation with plural Gram-positive cocci having superantigenic activity. Furthermore, bacterial hsp60-70 seemed to possess a certain homology, together with self-hsps. Recent studies suggest that an interaction between bacterial and self-hsp antibody responses to non-self epitopes might be promoted by the concomitant generation of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10, induced by self-epitopes. 35 Accumulating evidence from epidemiological or immunopathological studies has suggested that hsp60 autoantibodies can cross-react with bacterial and self-hsp60 and may induce cytotoxic damage of stressed endothelial cells, resulting in coronary atherosclerosis. [38] [39] [40] [41] These theories seem applicable to the pathogenesis of coronary lesions of KD, in view of the high expression of hsp60 in endothelial cells, together with the serological detection of bacterial and self-hsp in KD patients, demonstrated by some investigators. [17] [18] [19] Vascular surface-expressed hsp60, transferred from the cytoplasm or mitochondria following induction by bacterial hsp60 stimulation, can be recognized by circulating anti-hsp autoantibodies or cytotoxic T lymphocytes targeting autoantigens.",
