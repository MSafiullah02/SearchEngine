When investigating spreading dynamics, scientists wish to understand certain important aspects, such as what are the dynamical mechanisms behind the phenomena, whether there will be an outbreak, how many individuals will be infected, when will an individual be infected, and how to effectively predict and contain the spread. Addressing these problems provides many beneficial aspects for our society. For governments, the situations of epidemics could be apperceived, and effective containment measures could be provided [6]. For e-commerce, certain personalized recommendation strategies could be designed to promote the diffusion of products (e.g., popular clothing) [7]. For economics, financial risks may be perceived at an early stage and thus global economic crises could be evaded to some extent [8].",

Historically, the single spreading dynamics was placed in a well-mixed population, without any differences among individuals [4], [10]. Following this idea, researchers can theoretically predict the outbreak size, critical threshold, and associated critical phenomena. However, in reality, an individual only has contacts with a limited number of other individuals. This constraint can be characterized by a network G(V,E), where V and E are sets of nodes and edges, with nodes representing individuals and edges denoting interactions between individuals. Accordingly, scientists studied the single spreading dynamics on oversimplified networks (e.g., regular networks and Erd\u00f6s\u2013R\u00e9nyi (ER) [11] random networks), and analytically obtained the outbreak threshold and epidemic prevalence [12].",

For example, the node degree (i.e., the number of edges of a node) can vary over a few orders of magnitude, exhibiting a highly heterogeneous nature [13]. Other frequently observed features that cannot be well captured by the oversimplified models include the small-world property [14], community structure [15], multiplexity [16], spatiality [17], temporality [18], and so on. In a pioneering work [19], Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani studied a single infectious virus on networks with power-law degree distribution (named as scale-free (SF) networks), and revealed that there is no epidemic threshold for a specific range of the degree exponent. Following this work, researchers found the spreading dynamics, such as for a global infectious disease, can be better predicted by accounting for more topological features of real networks [20], [21]. Many reviews and books have already summarized the state-of-the-art progress in single dynamics [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29].",

            "text": "The propagations of diseases, behaviors, and information in the real world are rarely independent of each other; rather, they are coevolving with strong interactions. Coevolution spreading exists widely, with important practical relevance [30]. For example, HIV results in the lower immunity of virus carriers, who are therefore more susceptible to infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and hepatitis [31], [32]. The propagation of disease-related information in social media could largely suppress the spreading of the corresponding epidemic disease [33]. In an extremely important case, in the early stage of the spreading of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China, an unofficial message entitled \u201cThere is a fatal flu in Guangzhou\u201d was sent to tens of millions of individuals [34]. As a result, individuals adopted simple but effective actions (e.g., staying home or wearing face masks) to protect themselves from being infected by SARS, which greatly decreased the final number of infected individuals. Scientists have already made efforts to uncover and understand the interaction mechanisms, spatiotemporal evolution patterns, critical phenomena, and phase transitions of networked coevolution spreading. The complex interactions during the coevolving dynamics lead to rich phase transition phenomena and novel physics, such as coexistence thresholds caused by competitive interactions [35] and discontinuous phase transition caused by synergetic interactions [36]. In addition, the multiscale structure of networks remarkably affects not only the value of thresholds, but also the critical exponents [37] and the type of phase transitions [38] of spreading dynamics. Therefore, the coevolution spreading dynamics on complex networks has attracted increasing attention in recent years.",

First, a large number of papers about coevolution spreading dynamics have emerged recently, but there is still a lack of a comprehensive review to systematically organize these results, discuss major challenges at the current stage, and point out open issues for future studies. Second, the early literature used different expressions to describe essentially the same mathematical problems and methods. It is thus urgent to unify the problem description and the symbolic system. Third, researchers have already tried to find certain potential applications, but these application possibilities are scattered in disparate fields, and lack integration. Accordingly, this review will be helpful to researchers already in the field, those who intend to enter the field, and those who wish to apply the related findings, and it will also contribute to the further development of the field.",

Four representative types of networked coevolution spreading are considered, including the coevolution of biological contagions, social contagions, awareness\u2013epidemic and resources\u2013epidemic. In Section 2, we introduce the coevolution spreading of biological contagions, in which each contact between susceptible and infected nodes may trigger the transmission of the infection. We mainly focus on the most representative biological contagions, i.e., epidemic spreading. However, in the spreading processes for political information, innovative products, and new drugs, a single contact is insufficient to eliminate the risk of adoption for susceptible individuals, and thus multiple contacts are necessary. The coevolution spreading of social contagions is presented in Section 3, which focuses on the spreading dynamics involving the above social reinforcement effects. To contain the epidemic, certain coevolution spreading strategies are developed. In Sections 4, 5, we respectively introduce the coevolution of awareness and an epidemic, and the coevolution of resources and an epidemic. Finally, in Section 6 we sketch the landscape of this emerging field, summarize representative progress, and make discuss the outlooks of the current challenges and future open issues of the field.",

            "text": "In 2001, Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani first studied epidemic spreading on SF networks [44]. They analyzed the survival probability Ps(t) of the virus data reported by the Virus Bulletin covering 50 months, and found Ps(t)\u223cexp(\u2212t\u2215\u03c4), where \u03c4 is the characteristic lifetime of the virus strain. Within the traditional framework for well-mixed populations of homogeneous networks (e.g., random networks and regular lattices), such a long lifetime suggested that the effective transmission rate was much larger than the epidemic threshold. However, the average fraction of the infected population was very small, which in contrast suggested a small value of the effective transmission rate in the traditional framework. To understand this seemingly paradoxical phenomenon, Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani studied the SIS model on Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert (BA) networks with power-law degree distribution P(k)\u223ck\u22123 (see Ref. [13] for the construction of BA networks). Using the heterogeneous mean-field theory, the spreading dynamics is described as (1)d\u03c1k(t)dt=\u2212\u03c1k(t)+\u03bbk[1\u2212\u03c1k(t)]\u0398(t),where \u03c1k is the density of infected nodes with degree k, \u0398(t)=1\u3008k\u3009\u2211kP(k)k\u03c1k(t) represents the probability that a randomly selected edge points to an infected node, and \u03bb is the effective transmission rate. To simplify the analysis, Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani set \u03b2=\u03bb and \u03b3=1, and thus the first term of Eq. (1) implies that all the infected nodes with degree k will become susceptible in the next time step, and the second term represents the fraction of susceptible nodes with degree k that will be infected by neighbors in this time step. In the steady state, d\u03c1k(t)\u2215dt=0, and the stationary density is (2)\u03c1k=k\u03bb\u03981+k\u03bb\u0398.From Eq. (2), one can conclude that the nodes with larger degrees are of higher probability to be infected. Linearizing around the initial conditions \u03c1k(0)\u21920, the epidemic threshold can be obtained as (3)\u03bbc=\u3008k\u3009\u3008k2\u3009,where \u3008k\u3009 and \u3008k2\u3009 are the first and second moments of the degree distribution P(k), respectively. When \u03bb\u2264\u03bbc, there is no global epidemic; otherwise, i.e., when \u03bb>\u03bbc, the global epidemic is possible.",

For example, BA networks [13] and random Apollonian networks (RANs) [45] are of the same degree distribution but exhibit very different structural features, and thus different epidemic behaviors. In addition, because Eq. (1) assumes that the states of neighbors are independent, the dynamical correlations among the states of neighbors are neglected, resulting in deviations from real dynamics.

            "text": "Although the above approaches more accurately predict the epidemic threshold than the heterogeneous mean-field theory, they still cannot accurately capture the dynamical correlations among the states of neighbors. For example, if there is only one seed node, the dynamical correlations are obvious because the contagion path has the same source, and the epidemic transmission events to one node coming from two neighbors may be correlated [52]. To overcome the weaknesses of the quenched mean-field approach but retain its advantages, i.e., to take into consideration the full network structure, the dynamic message-passing approach was proposed by Karrer and Newman [53] to study the SIR model, and generalized later by Shrestha et al. to describe the SIS model [54]. By disallowing a node in the \u201ccavity\u201d state from transmitting an infection to its neighbors but allowing it to be infected by them, the \u201cecho chamber\u201d [55] (i.e., where a node is reinfected by a neighbor it previously infected) is reduced in the dynamic message-passing approach. The dynamic message-passing approach predicts that the epidemic threshold is \u03bbc=1\u2215\u039bB, where B is the non-backtracking matrix. Note that B is a 2M\u00d72M nonsymmetric matrix with rows and columns indexed by directed edges i\u2190j, where M is the number of edges. The element of B is (4)Bi\u2190j,k\u2190\u2113=\u03b4jk(1\u2212\u03b4i\u2113),where \u03b4jk=1 if j=k, and \u03b4jk=0 otherwise. Recent studies showed that the dynamic message-passing approach predicts the epidemic spreading dynamics well on uncorrelated locally tree-like networks [56], and it has found wide applications in epidemic containment [52], locating spreading sources [57], and network dismantling [58]. However, the dynamic message-passing approach needs 2E+N differential equations, which is time-consuming for large networks. Moreover, some simplified approaches have been developed, such as the edge-based compartmental approach, which only uses four differential equations to describe the dynamics, and predicts the dynamics well on configuration networks [43].",

Miller [67] also claimed that clustering reduces the epidemic size and increases the epidemic threshold, and network clustering is an important factor in controlling the growth rate of epidemic spreading [68]. However, the effects of clustering seem to be dependent on the underlying network models. For example, studies on random SF networks with high clustering coefficients showed that high clustering cannot restore a finite epidemic threshold [69]. In a solvable model, Newman theoretically proved that higher clustering leads to an even lower epidemic threshold, because redundant paths introduced by triangles in the network provide more opportunities for the susceptible nodes to be infected [70]. Wang et al. [71] revealed that there is a double transition when epidemics spread on networks with cliques.",

By treating a simple network as a special weighted network with each edge associated with weight 1, it is obvious that real weighted networks are always of more heterogeneous weight distributions than that of a simple network. Indeed, scientists have demonstrated that the heterogeneity of the weight distribution markedly affects the epidemic dynamics, including both the epidemic threshold and epidemic prevalence [82], [83], [84]. Among the earliest works, Yan et al. [82] showed that nodes with larger strengths (a node\u2019s strength is defined by the sum of the weights of its associated edges) are preferentially infected.

Saumell-Mendiola et al. [88] studied the SIS model on interconnected networks. Through a generalized heterogeneous mean-field theory, they found that the global endemic state may occur, even though the epidemics cannot outbreak on each network separately. On the contrary, for the SIR model on interconnected networks, the epidemic occurs on both subnetworks when the coupling is strong enough; otherwise, a mixed phase exists [89]. Arruda et al.

[92] proposed an activity-driven network to model temporal networks, where each node i is assigned an activity potential xi independently drawn from a given probability distribution F(x), and is active with probability ai\u0394t=\u03b7xi\u0394t in each time step, where \u03b7 is a constant. Each active node generates m edges to connect with m randomly selected nodes. At the next time step, all existent edges are deleted and the newly active nodes generate edges to form a new network. For the SIS model on the proposed temporal networks, the epidemic threshold is \u03bbc=2\u3008a\u3009\u2215(\u3008a\u3009+\u3008a2\u3009), where \u3008a\u3009 and \u3008a2\u3009 are the first and second moments of ai, respectively. The results indicated that temporal networks are more robust to epidemic spreading than integrated static networks. Further analysis of this activity-driven model showed that memory inhibits the spreading of the SIR model, whereas it promotes the spreading of the SIS model [93]. Liu et al. [94] studied the SIS spreading process on time-varying multiplex networks, and found that strong multiplexity (i.e., the fraction of overlapping nodes) significantly reduces the epidemic threshold. Starnini et al. [95] revealed that the non-Markovian spreading dynamics can be captured by the effective infection rate.",

The two epidemics are denoted as red and blue epidemics with transmissibilities \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, respectively. Each node can only be infected by one of the two epidemics. Initially, a seed node for each epidemic is randomly selected. It is assumed that the blue epidemic evolves with time-step 1, and the red epidemic spreads with time-step 0\u2264\u03b1\u22641. Karrer and Newman developed the competing percolation to study the final state of the two epidemics theoretically. At early time t, the average number of nodes infected by the blue epidemic is Nb=etlnRb, where Rb=\u03bb2\u2215\u03bbc is the reproductive number for the blue epidemic, and \u03bbc=\u3008k\u3009\u2215(\u3008k2\u3009\u2212\u3008k\u3009). Similarly, the average number of infected nodes by the red epidemic at early time t is Nr=etlnRr\u2215\u03b1, where Rr=\u03bb1\u2215\u03bbc is the reproductive number for the red epidemic. Initially, the two epidemics increase exponentially. \u03b20 is defined as the ratio of the growth rates of the two epidemic, given by (11)\u03b20=ln(\u03bb1\u2215\u03bbc)\u03b1ln(\u03bb2\u2215\u03bbc).For the case of \u03b20>1 the red epidemic spreads faster; when \u03b20<1, the blue epidemic spreads faster.

In the thermodynamic limit, the faster epidemic spreads on the network first, and the slower one spreads on the residual network.

Generally speaking, two epidemics evolve according to the SIS model with infection probabilities \u03b21 and \u03b22. The recovery probabilities of the two epidemics are \u03b31 and \u03b32. To include the competing mechanism between two epidemics, scientists assumed that each susceptible node infected by one epidemic decreases its probability of being infected by the other one. For the case of two completely competing SIS epidemics on complex networks, i.e., each susceptible can only be infected by one of the two epidemics, Prakash et al. found that the stronger epidemic completely suppresses the other [108]. Once the two competing SIS epidemics have partial immunizing functions, there is a coexistence region of the two epidemics [109]. Bovenkamp et al. studied two competing SIS epidemics on a complete network [110], and revealed that only one epidemic exists when the transmission probability is above the epidemic threshold, which is markedly different from the observations of competing SIR epidemics. Disallowing epidemic extension by allowing one node to become infected automatically when there are no infected nodes, the dominant and dominated epidemics alternate when the two epidemics are identical. The domination period of an epidemic depends on its initially infected nodes. Yang et al. developed the criteria for the extinction of both epidemics and for the survival of only one epidemic when two competing epidemics have general infection rates [111], [112].",

            "text": "Different epidemics may transmit on distinct networks. Considering this factor, Sahneh and Scoglio proposed a competitive epidemic spreading model SI1SI2S over arbitrary multilayer networks [114]. In this model, each node can be in one of three states: susceptible, I1 (i.e., infected by epidemic 1), and I2 (i.e., infected by epidemic 2). The two epidemics spread on networks A and B with effective transmission rates \u03bb1=\u03b21\u2215\u03b31 and \u03bb2=\u03b22\u2215\u03b32, respectively, where \u03b21\n(\u03b22) is the transmission rate of epidemic 1 (epidemic 2), and \u03b31\n(\u03b32) is the recovery rate of epidemic 1 (epidemic 2). Note that a node cannot be infected by two epidemics simultaneously. Using the first-order mean-field approximation, the evolutions of the fractions of nodes infected by epidemics 1 and 2 are, respectively, (12)d\u03c11,idt=\u03b21(1\u2212\u03c11,i\u2212\u03c12,i)\u2211j=1NAij\u03c11,j\u2212\u03b31\u03c11,i,and (13)d\u03c12,idt=\u03b22(1\u2212\u03c11,i\u2212\u03c12,i)\u2211j=1NBij\u03c12,j\u2212\u03b32\u03c12,i,where i\u2208{1,2,\u2026,N}, \u03c11,i\n(\u03c12,i) represents the probability that node i is in the infected state of epidemic 1 (epidemic 2) in network A (network B), and A\n(B) is the adjacent matrix of network A\n(B). In the steady state, \u03c11,i\u2217 and \u03c12,i\u2217 denote the equilibrium probabilities of node i being infected by epidemics 1 and 2, respectively. Through a bifurcation analysis of the model, the system has four regions when two competing epidemics spread on multilayer networks. These are the epidemic-free, absolute dominance of epidemic 1, absolute dominance of epidemic 2, and coexistence regions, as shown in Fig. 4. When the two layers are identical, there is no coexistence region. For the epidemic-free region, i.e., \u03c11,i\u2217=\u03c12,i\u2217=0, the system is stable when \u03bb1\u22641\u2215\u039b1(A) and \u03bb2\u22641\u2215\u039b1(B), where \u039b1(A) and \u039b1(B) are the leading eigenvalues of the adjacent matrices A and B, respectively. For a given \u03bb2, the survival threshold \u03bbc1 of epidemic 1 is the critical value at which the coexistence equilibrium emerges, say (14)\u03bbc1=1\u039b(diag{1\u2212yi})A,where yi is the stable value of \u03c12,i\u2217 at the epidemic 2 absolute-dominance equilibrium, i.e., \u03c11,i=0 and \u03c12,i=yi>0. Similarly, another critical point \u03bbc2 is obtained, where coexistence equilibrium emerges for a given \u03bb1: (15)\u03bbc2=1\u039b(diag{1\u2212xi})B,where xi=\u03c11,i>0 and \u03c12,i=0.",

            "text": "Cooperation between two epidemic spreading dynamics means that when a node is infected by one epidemic, the probability increases that this node may become infected by the other epidemic. Such a cooperative effect is also called a synergetic effect. For example, once a person is infected by HIV/AIDS, his/her immune system becomes severely compromised, and thus the probability that he/she may become infected by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), syphilis, or hepatitis increases. Conversely, if a person infected by the latter diseases (e.g., SLE) is exposed to HIV, his/her infection probability is increased. Cai et al. [36] proposed a coevolution SIR spreading model with a cooperative effect between two epidemics, in which a node that has not yet been infected will be infected by one of the two epidemics with probability \u03bb1, and a node that has already been infected by one epidemic will be infected by the other with probability \u03bb2>\u03bb1. The two epidemics have the same recovery probability. The recovered nodes acquire immunity against the epidemic they had, but not against the other epidemic. Extensive numerical simulations have been performed on ER networks with average degree \u3008k\u3009=4. Two order parameters, namely the probability P of forming a giant infected cluster and the fraction \u03c1 of nodes belonging to the giant connected cluster, are used to describe the phase transition. The system undergoes a hybrid discontinuous transition. At the critical point, the system already has a finite fraction of an infected cluster. The fraction \u03c1ab of nodes infected by both epidemics 1 and 2 exhibits a discontinuous phase transition for a given \u03bb2, as shown in Fig. 5. Furthermore, the system undergoes a typical continuous transition on two-dimensional lattices. Specifically, the critical behavior is P\u223c\u03c1ab\u223c(\u03bb1\u2212\u03bbc1)\u03b1e, where \u03b1e\u22485\u221536. Grassberger et al. further discussed the roles of network topologies on the phase transition [115], and revealed that loops are crucial for the emergence of a discontinuous transition. For cooperative spreading dynamics on two-dimensional lattices with local contacts or on BA networks, there is no discontinuous transition. However, discontinuous transitions always appear for cooperative contagions on two-dimensional lattices with long-range connections, on four-dimensional lattices, and on ER networks. Chen et al. further investigated the fundamental properties of cooperative contagion processes of two SIS epidemics [116], [117]. It was assumed that a node had a higher rate of infection by one epidemic once it was already infected by another epidemic. Mathematically, it was assumed that the spreading dynamics occurred in well-mixed populations, and the system exhibited a discontinuous phase transition. In a recent study, Chen et al. [118] investigated a model of two interacting SIS epidemics, in which the reproduction number is altered by the interaction introducing a potential change in the secondary infection propensity. When the susceptible nodes move faster than the infected nodes, and the interaction strength is not very strong (i.e., neither too competitive nor too cooperative), there is a nontrivial spatial infection pattern in the system.",

            "text": "In biological systems, the variation of a virus such as influenza [123], HIV [124], meningitis [125], and dengue [126] could lead to thousands of new viruses. Understanding the statistical mechanics, strain structure, and spreading patterns has attracted much attention, especially in the fields of biomedicine and statistical physics. Here, we mainly introduce the progress related to physical science. Abu-Raddad et al. [127] proposed a model consisting of multiple interacting epidemics with the existence of coinfection, cross-immunity, and arbitrary strain diversity. It is assumed that the system has n different epidemics, denoted as H={1,2,\u2026,n}. Nodes in the recovered and infected states acquire immunity against the epidemic they had, but remain susceptible to the epidemics by which they have not been infected. Mathematically, IJL denotes the set of nodes that have recovered from the set of epidemics J and are infected by the set of epidemics L. There is no intersection between J and L. The birth rate of susceptible nodes is \u03b9 and the death rate is \u03bc. For an epidemic l, its transmissibility rate is \u03b2l, recovery rate is \u03b3l, and recovery period is \u03b3l\u22121. For each epidemic, the strength of infection can be expressed as \u039bi=\u03b2i\u2211J\u2286H\u2216{i}\u2211L\u2286H\u2216{{i}}\u22c3J. Abu-Raddad et al. assumed the existence of cross-immunity in the system, i.e., the susceptibility of the individuals in IJL should be multiplied by a factor of \u03c3J,Li. The evolutions of the system are (17)I\u02d9JL=\u03b9\u03b4J,0\u0338\u03b4L,0\u0338\u2212\u03bcIJL\u2212\u2211i\u2288J\u22c3L\u039bi\u03c3J,LiIJL+\u2211l\u2208L\u039bl\u03c3J,L\u2216llIJL\u2216I\u2212\u2211l\u2208L\u03b3lIJL+\u2211j\u2208JvJIJ\u2216jL\u22c3{j}.On the right hand of Eq. (17), the third term is the infection rate by epidemic i, the fourth term is the rate at which a new node is infected by this epidemic, the fifth term stands for the rate at which nodes recover from an epidemic in L, and the last term is the rate at which nodes that have recovered from an epidemic not in L will be infected by an epidemic in L. Abu-Raddad et al. further analyzed the final state of the spreading dynamics. They assumed that \u03c3j,l=\u03b7j\u03d5l, where \u03b7j is the prior cross-immunity rate of being infected by a new epidemic after exposure by and recovery from j different epidemics in the past, and \u03d5l is the cross-immunity rate of being infected by a new epidemic for a node that is currently infected by l different epidemics. The further assumed that \u03d5l=1 if l=0, \u03d5l=\u03d5 if l>0, \u03b7j=1 if j=0, and \u03b7j=\u03b7 if j>0. Under the above assumptions, the total prevalence is as shown in Fig. 7. The cross-immunity against coinfection has a more prominent influence on multiple epidemics than that of the prior exposure cross-immunity.",

For each epidemic, an SICR model is adopted, in which the compartment state (C state) is used to represent the period of convalescence, or a temporal period of immunosuppression or strain-transcending cross-immunity. The SIR part has the same meaning as in classical epidemic dynamics. Furthermore, the host demography is also included. When there are no interactions among the epidemics, the system exhibits damped oscillations. The interactions induce the emergence of sustained oscillations.

The cooperative strength is defined as H\u2113=\u03b2\u2113\u2215\u03bb1. At time t, the fraction of nodes infected by \u2113 different epidemics is \u03c1\u2113(t).

For single biological contagions on complex networks, the system always exhibits a continuous phase transition, and the threshold and critical behavior are associated with the network topologies. To describe the spreading dynamics quantitatively, each widely used theoretical approach has limitations and advantages. To summarize, the DMP approach can take into account the full topology of the network and deal with partial dynamical correlations, whereas the heterogeneous mean-field approach, bond percolation theory, edge-based compartmental approach, and quenched mean-field theory only perform well in networks with specific topological properties (e.g., uncorrelated local tree-like networks). For two successive biological contagions, the first epidemic may provide immunity or convenience to the second epidemic, and thus suppress or promote the second one. Generally, the coexistence threshold of two epidemics is larger than the first epidemic threshold. For the coevolution of two epidemics, scientists found that competing or cross-immunity interactions can induce the coexistence phase, and the phase diagram is affected by the network topology. For cooperative epidemics, the discontinuous phase transition and hysteresis loop are included, depending on the network dimensions and spreading dynamics. Finally, when multiple epidemics are simultaneously spreading, epidemic clusters emerge, with the exponent of cluster mass size versus diameter being close to the fractal dimension of percolation. The threshold and phase transition can be analytically solved on well-mixed populations.",

            "text": "The rapid development of Internet technology has enabled large-scale social experiments on online social networks. Centola [136] recruited 1528 participants online and tested the effects of the network structure on the contagion of health behavior. By comparing the spreading of health behavior on a regular clustered network and a random network (as shown in the left panel of Fig. 8), Centola found that the behavior spreads farther and faster across clustered networks than random networks, because the participants can receive social reinforcement from multiple neighbors in the former network (as presented in the right panel of Fig. 8). This is significantly different from the results of biological contagions, where a clustered structure usually suppresses the spreading. To investigate the robustness of Centola\u2019s experiment, L\u00fc et al. [140] proposed an unknown\u2013known\u2013approved\u2013exhausted model, which emphasizes the effect of social reinforcement by incorporating a mechanism by which redundant signals can increase the approval rate. They found that under certain conditions, information spreads faster and more broadly in a regular clustered network than in a random network, which to some extent supports the results of Centola\u2019s experiments. However, increasing the network size tends to favor effective spreading in a random network, which challenges the validity of the abovementioned experiment for larger-scale systems. Moreover, they found that introducing a low degree of randomness into a regular network yields the most effective information spreading. Similar to Ref. [140], Zheng et al. [141] further claimed that increasing the network size or decreasing the average degree enlarges the difference in the final fraction of approved nodes between regular and random networks. Smoking behaviors explicitly inflict the effects on people around the smokers; as a result, they also impact the initiation and cessation of smoking [142]. Christakis and Fowler studied the effects of peer influences on quitting behavior by analyzing a network of 12,067 people who underwent repeated assessments of their smoking behavior and social-network ties over a period of 32 years [143]. They found that the likelihood for a smoker to quit smoking depends on their exposure to multiple contacts with nonsmokers. The social reinforcement in encouraging smokers to abstain is also found online. Myneni et al. [144] found that smokers are more likely to abstain if they are exposed to several abstinent users by examining peer interactions over QuitNet\u2014a social media platform for smokers attempting to quit. A series of other studies also demonstrated that the effects of social reinforcement from the peers were strengthened when the peers come from different social groups, exhibit the value of structural diversity, and share some key characteristics with the ego in the dynamics of social contagion [145].",

            "text": "One early mathematical model established to describe the dynamics of social contagions is the threshold model [138], [156], [157], based on the Markovian process without memory, where the adoption of behaviors depends only on the states of the currently active neighbors (i.e., individuals who have adopted the behavior), and an individual adopts a behavior only when the number or the fraction of his/her active neighbors is equal to or exceeds the adoption threshold. Granovetter [156] proposed the linear threshold model, in which all individuals are in the active or inactive states, and an individual becomes active if and only if the current absolute number of active neighbors is equal to or exceeds the corresponding threshold. As real-world networks are highly heterogeneous, within the linear threshold framework, hub nodes are too vulnerable. To overcome this weakness, Watts takes into account the heterogeneity of individuals\u2019 number of contacts and proposes a novel threshold model (later named the Watts threshold model) [138]. In the model, each node is initially assigned a threshold \u03d5, randomly drawn from a distribution h(\u03d5). When the fraction of active neighbors of a node is equal to or exceeds its threshold \u03d5, it becomes active. Adopting the fraction of active neighbors instead of the absolute number is the essential difference compared with the linear threshold model. The function h(\u03d5) can be defined arbitrarily, but satisfies the condition \u222b01h(\u03d5)d\u03d5=1. For an infinite network with finite average degree, the only way that an initial seed node can grow is for at least one of its immediate neighbors to have a threshold such that \u03d5\u22641\u2215k, where k is the degree of this neighbor. These nodes with \u03d5\u22641\u2215k are called vulnerable nodes, because they become active with only one active neighbor. Specifically, for a node of degree k, the probability \u03c1k that it is vulnerable is (21)\u03c1k=1,k=0,F(1\u2215k),k>0,where F(\u03d5)=\u222b0\u03d5h(\u03c6)d\u03c6. By using the method of generating functions, the critical condition on an uncorrelated configuration model is [138]\n(22)\u2211kk(k\u22121)\u03c1kP(k)=\u3008k\u3009,where P(k) and \u3008k\u3009 respectively represent the degree distribution and the average degree of the network. The critical condition can be explained as follows. When \u2211kk(k\u22121)\u03c1kP(k)<\u3008k\u3009, most of the vulnerable clusters in the network are small and are not connected, and thus the initial seed node cannot induce the global behavior adoption. However, for \u2211kk(k\u22121)\u03c1kP(k)>\u3008k\u3009, there exists a giant vulnerable cluster in the network whose size cannot be neglected when the size of network becomes infinite, and therefore a random initial seed node can trigger a global cascade. A remarkable result is that if all individuals are of the same adoption threshold, the final adoption size first grows continuously and then decreases discontinuously with the increase in the average degree. Meanwhile, a global cascade occurs more easily in a network with a more heterogeneous degree distribution. In modeling the propagation of opinions, the diffusion of innovations, and the adoption of behaviors, the Watts threshold model is well recognized as the fundamental model. Similar to epidemic spreading dynamics, researchers have explored social contagions on complex networks based on the Watts threshold model for two aspects. One is to reveal the effects of network topology and the other is to understand the mechanisms of diffusion at the individual level.",

One manifest conclusion is that high clustering suppresses epidemic spreading, leading to an increase in the epidemic threshold and a decrease in the infection size [45]. In investigating the effects of clustering on the adoption of behaviors, Ikeda et al. [158] studied the Watts threshold model on a clustered network generated from a projection of bipartite graphs and compared it with a nonclustered network with the same degree distribution. Similar to the spreading of health behavior [136], [140], [141], global cascades occur more easily on clustered networks than on nonclustered networks [158]. Hackett et al. [159] explored cascades on clustered networks produced by the configuration model with adjustable clustering [70], and found that there exists a range of \u3008k\u3009 in which increasing the clustering of the network results in an increase in the mean cascade size, whereas outside of this range it will decrease the mean cascade size [160]. Hackett and Gleeson [161] further explored cascade phenomena on highly clustered clique-based graphs [162] and obtained a closed-form expression for the final fraction of active nodes within a clique of arbitrary size.",

They found if the seeds are contained in one of the communities initially, the peaks of the activation dynamics in each community are well-separated in time. Curato and Lillo [167] used the linear threshold model to explore the optimal structure of a network consisting of two communities to maximize the asymptotic extent of the diffusion. They found that the optimal structure can be assortative, core\u2013periphery, or even disassortative when the average degree and the fraction of initiators are constrained. In looking for a minimal fraction of initial seeds needed to trigger a global cascade, they showed that the optimal network is a very dense community linked to a much more sparsely connected periphery. The impact of community structure on the cascade processes based on the Watts threshold model was theoretically studied by Nematzadeh et al. [168]. They constructed a network model with two homogeneous modules, where the internal connectivities of the two communities are the same, and one parameter, i.e., the fraction of edges between the two communities, is used to control the strength of the community structure. There exists an optimal network modularity at which the cascade size is maximized. This study was extended to the case of a network with multiple modular communities [169], which yielded similar results, i.e., that modular structures facilitate the cascade and an optimal modularity exists.",

[172] generalized the Watts threshold model to multiplex networks, in which a node becomes active if the fraction of its active neighbors in any channel exceeds a certain threshold, i.e., maxi=1,\u2026,r(miki)\u2265\u03d5, where mi and ki respectively represent the number of active neighbors and the number of neighbors in channel i. Compared with contagions on single networks that have the same topology but without considering multiplexity, Brummitt et al. found that a multilayer network has a higher probability to experience a global cascade. Ya\u011fan and Gligor [173] proposed a content-dependent linear threshold model for social contagion in multiplex networks. In this model, each edge type i is associated with a content-dependent parameter ci in [0,\u221e] that measures the relative bias of type i in propagating this content. An inactive node becomes active if the total perceived influences, i.e., \u2211cimi\u2215\u2211ciki, where mi and ki respectively represent the number of active neighbors and the number of neighbors in type i, exceeds its threshold \u03d5. The authors showed that the content and edge types are important in characterizing a global cascade. Zhuang et al. [174] studied the content-dependent linear threshold model on clustered multiplex networks, and found that the clustering plays a double-faceted role in cascade processes, where the clustering decreases the cascade size when the average degree of the network is small, and facilitates cascades when the average degree is large. Along this line, Lee et al. [175] studied the effect of individuals\u2019 heterogeneous responses of Watts threshold model in multiplex networks. Two types of responses are introduced. In the first type, an individual becomes active if in at least one layer, a sufficiently large fraction of neighbors is active. In the second type, an individual becomes active only if the fraction of active neighbors is sufficiently large in every layer. They showed that varying the fractions of nodes following either rule facilitates or inhibits cascades. Furthermore, they found that the global cascades become discontinuous near the inhibition regime, and the cascade size grows slowly as the network density increases. Li et al. [176] explored cross-layer cascade processes in multiplex networks. They found that multiplexity accelerates the cascade if the additional layer can provide extra short paths for rapid spreading.",

            "text": "Some specific models incorporating the underlying mechanisms that affect the behavioral adoption of individuals have also been established. Melnik et al. [180] purposed a multistage social contagion model accounting for the fact that individuals in different stages of the spreading process exert different levels of influence on their neighbors, which can reproduce multistage cascade phenomena. Liu et al. [181] considered a specific situation, in which individuals in the network have several opinion leaders, who affect their behaviors markedly. The impact of opinion leaders makes global cascades occur more easily, which can not only reduce the lowest average degree of the network required for a global cascade, but also increase the highest average degree of a network for which a global cascade can occur. Kobayashi [182] generalized the Watts threshold model with a trend-driven mechanism, which introduces another type of node, global nodes whose states depend on the fraction of activated nodes in the population. When the fraction of activated nodes in the population exceeds a threshold, a trend emerges and the global nodes become active. Kobayshi showed that global nodes accelerate cascades once a trend emerges, whereas their existence reduces the probability of a trend emerging. Accordingly, there exists a moderate fraction of global nodes that maximizes the average size of cascades. The persuasion mechanism, which can strengthen the ability of activated nodes to convince their neighbors to adopt the behavior is also considered in the Watts threshold model purposed by Huang et al. [183]. They found that this introduced mechanism can render networks more vulnerable to global cascades, especially in heterogeneous networks. Ruan et al. [184] generalized the Watts threshold model with mechanisms of spontaneous adoption and complete reluctance to adoption (i.e., immune or blocked nodes). They showed that the speed of spreading depends strongly on the density of blocked nodes. When the fraction of blocked nodes is small, spontaneous adopters are able to generate a large cascade. When the fraction of blocked nodes is large, because spontaneous adopters dominate the spreading, only small cascades can be generated and the spreading becomes slow. Juul and Porter [185] incorporated synergistic effects into the Watts threshold model, and found that constructive synergy (i.e., the peer pressure experienced by a node is larger than in the Watts threshold model) accelerates the contagion process and interfering synergy (i.e., the peer pressure experienced by a node is less than in the Watts threshold model) slows down the contagion process. Oh and Porter [186] accounted for the case in which individuals wait for some period of time before they adopt a behavior. Their results indicated that heterogeneously distributed wait times can change the adoption order of nodes, and either accelerate or decelerate the spread of adoptions.",

            "text": "Social reinforcement resulted from multiple exposures of peer influence is a key feature of social contagions. In the above-discussed models, whether a node becomes active depends only on the number of current exposures from its neighbors, without memory effects. However, the historical records may be relevant; for example, recent exposures may be more important than long-ago exposures. In such cases, memory plays a significant role and the dynamics become non-Markovian. To account for memory effects, Dodds and Watts [187], [188] proposed a generalized threshold model, where each individual i contacts with one other individual j drawn randomly from the population. If i is susceptible and j is infected, with probability \u03b2, node i receives a positive dose di(t) sampled from a distribution at time step t. Each individual i maintains a memory of doses received over the previous T time steps, recorded by Di(t)=\u2211t\u2032=t\u2212T+1tdi(t\u2032). A susceptible individual i becomes infected if Di(t)\u2265di\u2217, where di\u2217 is a certain threshold initially drawn from the distribution g(d\u2217). The probability that a susceptible individual contacts K\u2264T infected individuals in T time steps and then becomes infected is (23)Pinf(K)=\u2211k=1KKk\u03b2k(1\u2212\u03b2)K\u2212kpk,where pk=\u222b0\u221edd\u2217g(d\u2217)P(\u2211i=1kdi\u2265d\u2217), which means the average fraction of individuals infected after receiving k positive doses in T time steps, and P(\u2211i=1kdi\u2265d\u2217) denotes the probability that the sum of k doses drawn from f(d) exceeds a given d\u2217. Each infected individual i recovers with probability \u03b31 if Di(t) is smaller than di\u2217, and the recovered individuals become susceptible with probability \u03b32 in each time step. By adjusting the parameters, such as di(t), di\u2217, \u03b2, \u03b31, and \u03b32, this generalized threshold model can be reduced to the SIS, SIR, Watts threshold model, and so on. Specifically, when \u03b31=1, \u03b32=1, and \u03d5\u2217 denotes the steady-state fraction of infected individuals, Eq. (23) becomes (24)\u03d5\u2217=\u2211k=1T(\u03b2\u03d5\u2217)k(1\u2212\u03b2\u03d5\u2217)T\u2212kpk.By analyzing the fixed points of Eq. (24), three universal classes of equilibrium behavior are found (see Fig. 9). Furthermore, when the length of the memory T is fixed, the class to which a particular system belongs is only determined by p1 and p2, which respectively represent the probabilities that an individual will become infected as a result of one and two exposures.",

[189] put forward a non-Markovian susceptible\u2013adopted\u2013recovered (SAR) social contagion model. Initially, a fraction \u03c10 of individuals are randomly chosen as seeds. At each time step, adopted individuals transmit the behavior information to their susceptible neighbors with transmission probability \u03b2. Once an adopted neighboring individual v of individual u transmits the behavior information to u successfully, the cumulative number of received pieces of information of u is increased by 1 and individual v cannot transmit the same information to u again, i.e., the information transmission is nonredundant. At time step t, assume a susceptible individual u of degree k already has m\u22121 pieces of information, and once u receives another piece of information, the probability that it adopts the behavior is \u03c0(k,m) whose maximum possible value is one. The adopted individual permanently becomes recovered with probability \u03b3. An edge-based compartmental theory has been developed, and a variable \u03b8 was adopted to represent the probability that a random neighboring individual v had not transmitted the information to individual u at the end of the spreading dynamics. The expression of \u03b8 is (25)\u03b8=(1\u2212\u03c10)\u2211k\u2032k\u2032P(k\u2032)\u0398(k\u2032,\u03b8)\u3008k\u3009+\u03b3\u03b2(1\u2212\u03b8)(1\u2212\u03b2),where \u0398(k\u2032,\u03b8) is the probability that an individual has received m pieces of nonredundant information. The critical condition for the behavior to be widely adopted is (26)\u03b2c=\u03b3\u0394+\u03b3\u22121,where \u0394=(1\u2212\u03c10)[\u2211k\u2032k\u2032P(k\u2032)d\u0398(k\u2032,\u03b8)d\u03b8|\u03b8c]\u2215\u3008k\u3009. The Heaviside step function is adopted to depict \u03c0(k,m), as \u03c0(k,m)=1 when m\u2265Tk. By using a bifurcation analysis of Eq. (25) in the steady state, one main result is that the transition phase of the final adoption size on \u03b2 can be changed from discontinuous to continuous, as shown in Fig. 10.",

            "text": "Within the SAR model, there are many factors that potentially impact the behavior adoption. Wang et al. [189] took the limited contact capacity of individuals in transmitting information and suggested that enlarging the contact capacity facilitates global adoption. Considering the heterogeneity of individuals, a binary threshold model is proposed in Ref. [198], in which some individuals have a low adoption threshold (i.e., activists), and the remaining individuals have a high adoption threshold (i.e., bigots). A hierarchical adoption phenomenon is observed, where activists first adopt the behavior and then stimulate bigots to adopt the behavior. Moreover, the model also shows crossover phenomena in the phase transition. Wang et al. [194] also explored the heterogeneous credibility of individuals in social contagion. Zhu et al. [199], [200] studied local trend imitation within a social contagion model, where both tent-like adoption and gate-like adoption probabilities were analyzed. Tent-like adoption means that the adoption probability is an increasing function of x (i.e., the fraction of adopted neighbors) when x is smaller than a certain value, above which it becomes a decreasing function of x. The gate-like adoption, however, means that the behavior adoption probability is equal to 1 when x is in a certain range, and it is equal to 0 when x is out of this range. For the tent-like case, they showed that the local trend imitation capacity impacts the phase transition, where a second-order phase transition is observed when the capacity is strong, and it becomes a first-order phase transition when the capacity is weak [199]. An optimal imitation capacity is found to maximize the final adoption size in the gate-like case [200]. Su et al. [201] proposed a susceptible\u2013trial\u2013adopted\u2013susceptible (STAS) threshold model, where individuals in the trial state accept the behavior temporarily and can transmit the information. They found that the initial conditions of the dynamics affect the final state of the dynamics, which introduces a hysteresis loop in the system. Wang et al. [202] considered that individuals communicate with multiple channels. When an individual is active in one layer, he/she cannot use other channels to communicate, as individuals cannot simultaneously use all communication channels. Time delays occur and slow down the behavior adoption process; however, this does not affect the final adoption size. Wang et al. [203] proposed a model in which time delays are introduced before an individual adopts a behavior when his/her fraction of adopted neighbors is equal to or exceeds the adoption threshold. They found that long time delays induce a microtransition, which becomes sharper when high-degree individuals have a larger probability of experiencing time delays.",

            "text": "The threshold model [138], [156] and the non-Markovian SAR model [189] only take into account the synergy effects, i.e., the reinforcement effects, of susceptible individuals\u2019 direct neighbors. However, much evidence indicates that other infected individuals around a pair of susceptible\u2013infected individuals would strengthen the transmission rate between them [204]. P\u00e9rez-Reche et al. [205] proposed a generalized SIR model, in which the transmission rate between an infected individual (donor) and one of its susceptible neighbors (recipient) depends on the neighborhood of this donor\u2013recipient (d-r) pair, as (27)\u03bbd\u2212r(t)=max{0,\u03b1+\u03b2d\u2212r(t)},where \u03b1 is a positive constant representing the basic rate of infection for an isolated d\u2212r pair without synergy effects. The rate \u03b2d\u2212r(t) quantifies the degree of synergistic effects. In the absence of synergistic effects, \u03b2d\u2212r(t)=0 and the model reduces to the simple SIR process. Two types of synergy are introduced in the model, and the expression for \u03b2d\u2212r(t) depends on the synergy type. When multiple donors challenge a recipient host (i.e., r-synergy type), \u03b2d\u2212r(t)=\u03b2[nr(t)\u22121] with nr(t) representing the number of donors challenging a recipient host at time t. The rate \u03b2 measures the strength of the synergy, which is constructive for \u03b2>0 and interfering for \u03b2<0. The other type of synergy (i.e., d-synergy) accounts for the effect of other donors connected to a donor that is challenging a recipient host. For d-synergy type, \u03b2d\u2212r(t)=\u03b2nd(t) and nd(t) represents the number of other donors at time t. The rate \u03b2 is of the same meaning as for r-synergy. As shown in Fig. 11, the epidemic threshold \u03b1 is a nonincreasing function of \u03b2 for both r-synergy and d-synergy. P\u00e9rez-Reche et al. also showed that constructive synergy induces an exploitative behavior that results in a rapid spreading process, and interfering synergy causes a slower and sparser exploitative foraging strategy that traverses larger distances by infecting fewer hosts. Within this framework, Taraskin and P\u00e9rez-Reche [206] found that increasing the connectivity of a lattice enhances the synergistic effects on spreading. Broder-Rodgers et al. [207] investigated the effects of both the r-synergistic mechanism and network topology (by rewiring edges in regular lattices) on the epidemic threshold of the SIR model. They found the network topology markedly impacts the spread. Under strong constructive synergy, the systems become more resilient to the spread of the epidemic after more rewiring. However, rewiring always enhances the spread of epidemics when the synergy is destructive or weakly constructive, if the local connectivity is low.",

Otherwise, he/she loses interest and never spreads it. Daley and Kendall [212], [213] first proposed an ignorant\u2013spreader\u2013stifler model to describe the dynamical process of rumor spreading. In the model, the ignorant, spreader, and stifler states are respectively similar to the susceptible, infected, and removed states in the SIR model. In contrast to the SIR model, the recovery process (spreader becomes stifler) of the rumor model is not spontaneous. Rather, it is the consequence of individuals\u2019 interactions. In detail, both spreaders become stiflers with probability \u03b3 once they contact, and a spreader becomes a stifler with probability \u03b3 once he/she meets an another stifler. Instead of two spreaders becoming stiflers when they contact in the recovery process, Maki and Thompson [214] introduce a slightly distinct version, in which, when a spreader i contacts another individual j in the spreader state, only i turns into a stifler and the state of j remains unchanged. Barrat et al. [215] studied the rumor model on the complete graph and found that the final fraction, \u03c1(\u221e), of stiflers satisfies the following self-consistent equation (30)\u03c1(\u221e)=1\u2212e\u2212(1+\u03b2\u2215\u03b3)\u03c1(\u221e),where, \u03b2 is the transmission rate between a spreader and an ignorant. From Eq. (30), it is found that the rumor becomes an outbreak for any \u03b2\u2215\u03b3>0, which is different from the finite threshold for the SIR model on homogeneous networks. Moreover, when simulating the Maki\u2013Thompson model on SF networks, Moreno et al. [216], [217] found that the outbreak threshold for rumor spreading is finite. Nekovee et al. [218] found that if the spontaneous recovery process is allowed with a constant rate, the rumor model behaves exactly as the SIR model, such as an infinite threshold on a SF network. These findings show that the dynamic process of rumor spreading is markedly different from the SIR model.",

            "text": "\nThe studies of two successively interacting epidemics were introduced in the previous section. In comparison, there are very few studies about two successively interacting social spreading processes. Liu et al. [220] proposed a successively interacting social contagion model, in which two behaviors, i.e., behavior 1 and behavior 2, spread successively on a network. The dynamical processes of both behaviors are depicted by a modified version of the SAR threshold model [189], with a different behavioral response function. During the spread of behavior 1, for a susceptible node of degree k and with m\u22121 cumulative pieces of behavior information, when this node receives a new piece of information at this time step, the probability that it adopts the behavior is \u03c0(k,m)=1\u2212(1\u2212\u03c41)m, where \u03c41 is the adopting probability for each reception of behavior information. At the termination of behavior 1, a small fraction of nodes are randomly chosen and set to be in the adopted state for behavior 2. The remaining nodes are in the susceptible state for behavior 2. The spreading dynamics of behavior 2 are mathematically identical to the dynamics of behavior 1, except that the transmission probability \u03b22 and recovery rate \u03b32 are different. For simplicity, we denote the effective information transmission rate as \u03bb2, given by \u03bb2=\u03b22\u2215\u03b32. When a susceptible node u of degree k receives a piece of information about behavior 2 and the cumulative number of pieces of information about behavior 2 is m, then node u adopts behavior 2 with a probability (31)\u03c8(k,m,Xu)=1\u2212(1\u2212\u03c42)m,Xu=S,1\u2212(1\u2212\u03b1\u03c42)m,Xu=R,where \u03c42 is the adopting probability for each reception of behavior information 2, Xu denotes the state of node u for behavior 1, and \u03b1 quantifies the impact of behavior 1 adoption on adopting behavior 2. When \u03b1>1\n(\u03b1<1), the adopting probability for each reception of behavior information 2 is increased (decreased), corresponding to the cooperative (inhibitive) effects of behavior 1. The adoption of behavior 1 has no effect on adopting behavior 2 when \u03b1=1, and \u03b1=0 indicates that if a node has adopted behavior 1, it never adopts behavior 2, which means that behavior 1 completely suppresses the adoption of behavior 2. An edge-based compartmental method was established, and the equation for behavior 2 in the steady state is written as (32)\u03b82=\u2211k\u2032k\u2032P(k\u2032)\u03a62(k\u2032,\u03b81,\u03b82)\u3008k\u3009+(1\u2212\u03b82)(1\u2212\u03b32\u03bb2)\u03bb2,where \u03b81\n(\u03b82) represents that in the final state, a random individual does not successfully transmit the behavior information 1 (2) to his/her neighbor along a random edge. It is useful to define g(\u03bb2,\u03b81,\u03b82) to be the right-hand of Eq. (32) minus the left-hand of Eq. (32). Thus, for a given \u03b81 (i.e., \u03bb1=\u03b21\u2215\u03b31), combining Eq. (32) and (33)dg(\u03bb2,\u03b81,\u03b82)d\u03b82|\u03b82c=0,the critical transmission probability of behavior information 2 is determined and the type of phase transition can be analyzed by the bifurcation theory. To determine the critical condition for the change of phase transition types (from continuous to discontinuous in the presence of inhibition effects, and from discontinuous to continuous in the presence of synergy effects), Eqs. (32), (33), and the second derivative of g(\u03bb2,\u03b81,\u03b82) with respect to \u03b82c equals zero are solved numerically. Liu et al. showed that with the outbreak of behavior 1, the inhibition effects of behavior 1 can cause the continuous phase transition of the spreading of behavior 2 to become discontinuous. Meanwhile, this discontinuous phase transition of behavior 2 can also become continuous when the effects of the adoption of behavior 1 become synergistic (see Fig. 12).",

In this model, behavior 1 and behavior 2 are assumed to spread on layers A and B, respectively, where the adoption thresholds of the two behaviors are respectively equal to T1 and T2. The synergistic mechanism is that the adoption of one behavior by a node in one layer enhances its probability of adopting another behavior in the other layer. Mathematically speaking, once node i has adopted behavior 1 (2), it generates an increase \u0394T2\n(\u0394T1) in the number of pieces of information about behavior 2 (1). For example, if a node has adopted behavior 2 and has received a cumulative total of m pieces of information about behavior 1 from distinct neighbors in layer A, this node will adopt behavior 1 if \u0394T1+m\u2265T1. An edge-based method was established to describe such model, In particular, when the dynamical parameters and network parameters for behaviors 1 and 2 are the same, one has (34)\u03b8=[1\u2212\u03c1(0)]\u2211kkP(k)\u03a6(k,\u03b8)\u3008k\u3009+(1\u2212\u03b8)(1\u2212\u03bc\u03bb)\u03bb.In the above equation, when \u03bb=\u03bb1=\u03bb2 and \u03b3=\u03b31=\u03b32, the bifurcation theory was used to analyze the above equations. One interesting result is that the synergistic interactions can greatly enhance the spreading of the behaviors in both layers. They also found that the synergy effects alter the nature of the phase transition of the behavior adoption processes, where a small (large) value of the transmission rate of behavior 1 (with a low adoption threshold) can lead to a discontinuous (continuous) phase transition in behavior 2 (with a high adoption threshold). Moreover, a two-stage spreading phenomenon is observed with the synergy effects, whereby nodes adopting the low-threshold behavior in one layer are more likely to adopt the high-threshold behavior and further stimulate the remaining nodes to quickly adopt the behavior in the other layer.",

The model considers two aspects of the diffusion process. One is inclusive adoption, which allows individuals to adopt two behaviors (i.e., synergy adoption). At first, each naive individual (without adoption of any behaviors) becomes active with probability (35)\u03b2(i\u21901or2)=(i1K1)\u03b1+(i2K2)\u03b11+(i1K1)\u03b1+(i2K2)\u03b1,where i1 and i2 respectively represent the fractions of neighbors who have adopted behavior 1 and behavior 2, K1 and K2 are constants, and \u03b1 is a free parameter. If it is activated, then with probability (36)Pr(i\u21901)=(i1K1)\u03b1(i1K1)\u03b1+(i2K2)\u03b1,it adopts behavior 1; otherwise, it adopts behavior 2. Once an individual adopts one behavior, it adopts another behavior with probability (i2K2)\u03b11+(i2K2)\u03b1. The other is stochastic dormancy, which means that an adopted individual becomes dormant at any given time step with a given rate. When an individual is considering adoption, if a neighbor is dormant then this neighbor\u2019s influence is discounted. Chang and Fu found that lower synergy makes contagions more susceptible to a global cascade, especially for those diffusing on lattices. Faster diffusion of one contagion with dormancy may block the diffusion of the other.",

            "text": "In the real world, multiple social contagion processes may compete or cooperate with each other and spread simultaneously, such that, with the wide adoption of social media and other socio-technical systems, the abundance of information to which we are exposed is exceeding our limited capacity [226], [227]. The information or ideas in different social media must compete for our limited attention to become popular. To understand the role of the limited attention of individual users in the diffusion of memes, Weng et al. [228] developed an agent-based model and investigated how they shape the spread of information (see Fig. 14 for the illustration of the meme diffusion model). By tuning the length of the time window during which posts are retained in an agent\u2019s screen or memory, they can change the extent of competition. For example, a shorter time window leads to less attention and thus enhances competition, whereas a longer time window allows for paying attention to more memes and thus decreases competition. By modeling the meme spreading on real social networks and random networks, they found that the combination of a social network structure and the competition for finite user attention is a sufficient condition for the emergence of broad diversity in meme popularity, lifetime, and user activity. Gleeson et al. [229] presented an analytically solvable model of selection behavior on a social network. They assumed each screen has capacity for only one meme, corresponding to fierce competition. During each time step (with time increment \u0394t=1\u2215N), one node i is chosen at random. Node i then innovates with probability \u03bc and generates a brand-new meme, which appears on its screen and is retweeted to all i\u2019s followers. Otherwise, node i retweets the meme currently on its screen. When a meme is retweeted, its popularity is incremented by 1 and the meme currently on the followers\u2019 screens is overwritten by this meme. They found that the competition among multiple memes for the limited user attention places the system at criticality. For a network of degree distribution P(k)\u221dk\u2212\u03b3D, with 2<\u03b3D<3, they derived the distribution of popularities at age a by qn(a) (i.e., a meme has been retweeted n times when its age is a) when a\u2192\u221e as (37)qn(\u221e)\u223cBn\u2212(\u03b3\u2215\u03b3\u22121),if\u03bc=0,Cn\u2212\u03b3,if\u03bc>0,Here, B and C are the prefactors (see Ref. [229] for details). From Eq. (37), they showed that the popularity growth of each meme is described by a critical branching process, and an asymptotic analysis predicts power-law distributions of popularities with very heavy tails in the zero-innovation limit (\u03bc=0). Gleeson et al. [230] further extended the above simplified model with the inclusion of memory times and heterogeneous user activity rates. Even this generalized model is more complicated; they showed that it is analytically solvable and is able to reproduce several important characteristics of empirical microblogging data on hashtag usage, such as the time-dependent heavy-tailed distributions of meme popularity. In modeling the collective behavior of users\u2019 decisions on adopting different software applications, Gleeson et al. [231] proposed a model that incorporates two distinct mechanisms: one is associated with recent user decisions and the other reflects the cumulative popularity of each application. They found various combinations of the two mechanisms that can yield long-time behavior matched with the data. However, only the models that strongly emphasize the recent popularity of applications over their cumulative popularity can reproduce the observed temporal dynamics.",

[232] studied URL diffusion on Twitter and proposed a statistical model that allows for the cooperation as well as competition of different contagions in the diffusion of retweeting behaviors. Competing contagions decrease each other\u2019s transmission rates, whereas cooperating contagions help each other. By evaluating the model on 18,000 contagions that are simultaneously spreading through the Twitter network, Myers et al. estimated the probability of a user being infected, given a sequence of previously observed contagions, and also found that the interactions between simultaneous contagions cause a relative change in the spreading probability of a contagion by 71% on average. Valera et al. [233] used continuous-time Hawkes processes to model the adoption of multiple products and conventions. An inference method was developed to estimate the parameters for both synthetic and real data. They found that this data-driven model predicts the adoption and the usage pattern of competing products and social conventions well. Meanwhile, the model reveals that the usage of more popular products and conventions is triggered by cooperation and using a less popular product or convention has a stronger inhibiting effect on future usage of a more popular product or convention than vice versa. Pathak et al. [234] proposed a generalized version of the linear threshold model to simulate multiple cascades on a network. In the model, nodes are allowed to switch their states back and forth. An algorithm was developed to estimate the most likely statistical properties of the cascades\u2019 spread and shown to be of high quality when tested with real data.",

Experimentally, various types of social contagions, ranging from health behaviors and new crops to Skype adoption, exhibit the social reinforcement effect. That is to say, accumulative multiple contacts between adopted and susceptible individuals are necessary to trigger the infection. When including the social reinforcement effect in social contagions, the order parameter, i.e., the cascade size or final fraction of adopted (activated) individuals, changes discontinuously or continuously, depending on the strength of the social reinforcement. In addition, the network structures and the underlying mechanism incorporated in social contagion models can alter the cascade size and the type of phase transition. For two successive and simultaneous social contagions, the inhibiting or synergistic effects of one spreading behavior can render the discontinuous phase transition of the other behavior as continuous. For the coevolution of multiple competitive and multiple cooperative social contagion processes, the competition induced by limited attention or memory is a sufficient condition for the emergence of broad diversity in meme popularity, and cooperative behaviors mutually promote each other\u2019s contagion.",

However, the results reported by Ginsberg et al. [242] were challenged until 2013, as GFT predicted more than double the fraction of doctor visits for ILI [245], [246]. Lazer et al.

On the one hand, GFT developers report that the data are highly correlated with the disease control and prevention (CDC), but not related to the flu. As a result, the data quality is not very high, because certain detailed information about the epidemic issues are ignored. On the other hand, the Google search algorithm is time-varying, which induces an unstable reflection of the prevalence of the flu.",

Fig. 15 shows the time series of nG(t) (i.e., the number of ILIs) and nD(t) (i.e., the volume of search queries). From the macroscopic perspective, ILI and GFT have similar trends, as shown in Fig. 15(a). The time series were further analyzed from a microscopic view. The relative growth rates of nG(t) and nD(t) are defined as vG(t) and vD(t), respectively. The growth trends of vG(t) and vD(t) are the same, as shown in Fig. 15(b). Furthermore, the cross-correlations c(t) between the vG(t) and vD(t) time series for a given window size Wl, as defined in Ref. [249], were investigated. As shown in Fig. 15(c), positive and negative cross-correlations c(t) are unveiled for Wl=3 and Wl=20, respectively. Once the susceptible individuals received information through GFT, they adopted certain actions to protect themselves from being infected, and thus the opposite growth was observed. The infected individuals tend to search for information about the disease, which leads to the same growth trends. Furthermore, Wang et al. found that the asymmetric interaction (i.e., the epidemic spreading promotes information diffusion but information diffusion suppresses the epidemic spreading) between information diffusion and epidemic spreading only occurred for a short period, as shown in Fig. 15(d).",

In their proposed model, information about the disease is called awareness. An individual i with awareness level \u2113i represents that the awareness has been through \u2113i individuals before arriving at i, and \u2113i=0 means that individual i has first-hand awareness. The awareness level of individual i is updated according to the following three rules. (i) A new awareness \u2113i=0 is generated with probability \u03c9 if individual i is in the infected state. (ii) If individual j transmits a newer piece of awareness with level \u2113j to his/her neighbor, individual i, with rate \u03b1, \u2113i is updated as \u2113i\u2190\u2113j+1 when \u2113j<\u2113i. (iii) At each time step, the awareness level \u2113i of node i fades to \u2113i+1 with probability \u03f5. For a susceptible node with awareness level \u2113, its susceptibility is 1\u2212h\u2113, where 0<h<1. That is, the older the awareness is (i.e., the higher its level), the weaker the protection power is. In consideration of awareness, the SIR epidemic evolves as follows. An infected node transmits the infection to a susceptible neighbor of awareness level \u2113 with probability (1\u2212h\u2113)\u03b2, and recovers with probability \u03b3. Using a mean-field approach, the authors revealed that the outbreak threshold does not change in a well-mixed population, although the epidemic size is much lower than one without awareness. However, the epidemic outbreak threshold increases on highly structured networks, such as lattices. As shown in Fig. 16, in the snapshot, the infected nodes are surrounded by a cloud of awareness, which greatly suppresses the epidemic spread.",

[253] further considered a more complicated case in which the epidemic spreading is characterized by a classical epidemic SIRS model [4] and the awareness spreading is described by a generalized SIS model. In the former, the infection, recovery, and loss of immunity probabilities are \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4; in the latter, an infected node becomes aware with probability \u03c9, an aware node transmits the awareness to unaware neighbors with probability \u03b1, and an aware node loses awareness with probability \u03bb. The dynamical parameters are dependent on whether nodes are aware of the epidemic information. (i) Reduced susceptibility and infectivity. The awareness suppresses the infectious transmission, as shown in Table 1. (ii) Faster recovery. The recovery probability of an aware\u2013infected node is \u03b5\u03b3. (iii) Longer preservation of immunity. For an unaware recovered node, the probability of loss of immunity is \u03b4, and for an aware recovered node, the probability of loss of immunity is \u03d5\u03b4. With the above three modifications, the basic reproductive number R0d of the epidemic is different for distinct situations. If the susceptibility of a susceptible node is reduced, R0d is only dependent on the basic reproductive number R0a of the awareness. Funk et al. [253] computed the corresponding reproduction number for different situations. By reducing infectivity of infected nodes and fixing other parameters, i.e., \u03c3S=\u03b5=\u03d5=1, the global epidemic outbreak conditions are R0d>1+(1\u2212\u03c3I)\u03c9\u03bb+\u03b3+\u03c3I\u03c9 when R0a<1, and R0d>1+(1\u2212\u03c3I)[R0a(1+\u03c9\u2215(\u03b1+\u03b3))\u22121]1+\u03c3I[R0a(1+\u03c9\u2215(\u03b1+\u03b3))\u22121] when R0a>1. When the faster recovery strategy is implemented, the global epidemic outbreak conditions are R0d>1+(\u03b5\u22121)\u03c9\u03bb+\u03b5\u03b3+\u03c9 if R0a<1, and R0d>1+R0a\u22121+\u03c9\u2215(\u03b1+\u03b3+\u03c9)R0a+(\u03b5\u22121)\u03b3\u2215(\u03b1+\u03b3+\u03c9)(\u03b5\u22121) if R0a>1. The epidemic outbreak thresholds for these situations are shown in Fig. 17. To sum up, the epidemic threshold increases if the infection and recovery rates are changed, owing to the diffusion of awareness. Agaba et al. [254] proposed a model in which the awareness is induced by two aspects: direct contacts between aware and unaware nodes and public information, and they revealed distinct dynamical regimes.",

A susceptible\u2013infected\u2013recovered\u2013vaccination (SIRV) model was proposed to describe the epidemic spreading dynamics. Mathematically, the SIR component of the spreading dynamics is identical to the classical SIR model, with infection and recovery probabilities of \u03b2 and \u03b3, respectively. A susceptible node becomes vaccinated with probability \u03ba(t). Nodes in the recovery and vaccinated states do not participate in the spreading dynamics. At each time step, there are \u03c4N newly generated packets with randomly chosen origins and destinations, following a shortest-path routing protocol [256]. At time t, if a node receives mI(t) packets from infected neighbors, it becomes vaccinated with probability \u03ba(t)=1\u2212e\u2212\u03b7mI(t)k, where \u03b7 is the strength of the sensitivity to information, and k is the degree of the node. Through extensive simulations, Ruan et al. [255] found that the final epidemic size \u03c1R(\u221e) monotonously changes with vaccination \u03c1V(\u221e), as shown in Fig. 18. Specifically, the epidemic may outbreak globally or locally for low vaccination prevalence, which is markedly different from other classical immunization approaches, e.g., random, degree-based, and betweenness-based approaches.",

Some studies considered the coevolution of awareness and epidemics on well-mixed populations [259], in which the awareness is generated by mass media. Some interesting phenomena are observed when awareness spreading is induced by mass media. For example, sustained oscillations may occur if the awareness is larger than a threshold [259]. Wang et al. [260] investigated the effects of mass media on the spread of epidemics on complex networks, where the epidemic spreading is described by the SIS model. The mass media density is a linear function of the current epidemic prevalence. By using the approach developed in Ref.

Their results indicate that mass media is an effective tool in controlling global epidemic outbreaks.",

In this case, the evolution of awareness is directly determined by the evolution of the epidemic. Thus, we only need to write down the evolution equations of the epidemic. Zhang et al. [236] proposed an awareness\u2013epidemic model, in which the awareness of a susceptible node is determined by the number of its infected neighbors. In this model, a susceptible node with awareness has a smaller infectivity probability, i.e., the infection probability is \u03bb(1\u2212\u03b1r)nI, where \u03bb is the basic infection probability, \u03b1r is the reduction factor, and nI is the number of infected neighbors. Zhang et al. used the heterogeneous mean-field theory to describe the spreading dynamics, and found that the outbreak thresholds of SIS and SIR models are the same, as follows: (38)\u03bbc=11\u2212\u03b1r\u3008k\u3009\u3008k2\u3009\u2212\u3008k\u3009.From Eq.

With the scheme presented in Fig. 19, the generalized MMCA equations of the coevolution dynamics are (39)piUS(t+1)=piAI(t)\u03b31\u03b32+piUS(t)ri(t)qiU(t)+piAS\u03b31qiU(t),piAS(t+1)=piAI(t)(1\u2212\u03b31)\u03b32+piUS[1\u2212ri(t)]qiA(t)+piAS(t)(1\u2212\u03b31)qiA(t),piAI(t+1)=piAI(t)(1\u2212\u03b32)+piUS(t){[1\u2212ri(t)][1\u2212qiA(t)]+ri(t)[1\u2212qiU(t)]}+piAS(t){\u03b31[1\u2212qiU(t)]+(1\u2212\u03b31)[1\u2212qiA(t)]}.In the steady state, linearizing Eq. (39), the epidemic outbreak threshold is (40)\u03bbc2=\u03b32\u039bmax(H),where \u039bmax(H) is the largest eigenvalue of matrix H, whose elements are Hji=[1\u2212(1\u2212\u03b4)piA]Bji. From Eq. (40), the epidemic threshold is dependent on the topology of the physical network and the awareness outbreak size. If the awareness cannot achieve an outbreak, the epidemic threshold reduces to \u03bbc2=\u03b32\u2215\u039bmax(B), which is the same as the classical epidemic outbreak threshold [49]. Granell et al. defined (\u03bbc1,\u03bbc2) as the metacritical point of epidemic spreading, and the average accuracy of the approximation in the MMCA approach is approximately 98%. The phase diagram of the coevolution dynamics is shown in Fig. 20 for different values of \u03b31 and \u03b32. The metacritical point is bounded by [0,1\u2215\u039bmax(A)]\u00d7[0,1\u2215\u039bmax(B)], where \u039bmax(A) is the largest eigenvalue of matrix A.",

[267] assumed that (1) the infected nodes immediately become aware, and (2) the aware nodes have a lower susceptibility with a certain probability. What happens when these two assumptions are removed? To this end, Granell et al. [268] proposed a novel model without the two assumptions but including a new aspect, i.e., that the mass media can broadcast awareness. A generalized MMCA approach is developed to describe the proposed model, and it agrees markedly well with numerical simulations. Granell et al. revealed that the first assumption has almost no effect on the epidemic spreading, whereas the second assumption and mass media indeed alter the phase diagram. For instance, the metacritical point disappears if the mass media effect is strong enough. Kan and Zhang included this mechanism in the coevolution of awareness and epidemics, and revealed that self-awareness generation (i.e., an unaware individual becoming aware spontaneously) cannot alter the epidemic outbreak threshold [269]. Starnini et al. [270] found that the temporal correlations slow down the epidemic spreading, and slow down (speed up) the awareness spreading for small (large) values of epidemic transmission probability.",

            "text": "In reality, the awareness spreading is different from the epidemic spreading. When an epidemic outbreaks, the information about the epidemic can spread on various channels such as Twitter, Facebook, and text messages through mobile phones. However, the susceptible nodes may not become aware immediately when they only receive one piece of information from their neighbors [2]. Thus, the awareness spreading exhibits a social reinforcement or herd-like feature [271]. Guo et al. proposed a local awareness-controlled contagion spreading (LACS) model to describe the coevolution of awareness and epidemics on multiplex networks [272]. The Watts threshold model [138] is used to describe the awareness spreading, in which an unaware node becomes aware if (1) the fraction of its aware neighbors exceeds a given threshold \u03d5, or (2) it is infected by the epidemic. The aware node reverts to unaware when it is susceptible or relaxes its vigilance. For the epidemic spreading dynamics, they adopted the model proposed in Ref. [267] with complete immunization, i.e., \u03bb2\u2032=0. Using a generalized MMCA approach, Guo et al. obtained a highly accurate prediction of the epidemic threshold. Through extensive numerical simulations and theoretical analyses, the epidemic threshold \u03bbc2 versus \u03d5 exhibits an abrupt decrease at \u03d5c\u22480.5. For the case of \u03d5<\u03d5c, the epidemic size and outbreak threshold remain nearly unchanged with \u03d5. When \u03d5>\u03d5c, the epidemic threshold does not vary with \u03d5, but the epidemic size increases with \u03d5. Huang et al. [273] investigated the coupled contagion of awareness and an epidemic, where the former is depicted by the unaware\u2013aware\u2013unaware (UAU) model on the aware layer and the latter is represented by the threshold model (susceptible\u2013infected) on the contact layer. The interacting mechanisms are introduced such that an unaware individual immediately changes to the aware state if it is infected in the contact layer. A susceptible individual can be infected by each of its infected neighbors with a certain probability if it is in the unaware state. However, an aware and susceptible individual can only be infected by the epidemic when the number of its infected neighbors is equal to or exceeds a threshold. Huang et al. found that such heterogeneous interactions can induce hybrid phase transitions in which a continuous phase transition and bi-stable states coexist.",

Pan and Yan [274] proposed a coevolution model of awareness and epidemics, in which the awareness of nodes comes from three types of information: contact information as well as local and global prevalence of the epidemic. The epidemic threshold increases with the contact-based information, but does not change with the information about the local and global prevalence of the epidemic. Furthermore, the effects of the heterogeneity of individuals\u2019 responses, and the structures of the virtual and contact networks are investigated, and the existence of two-stage effects on the epidemic threshold is demonstrated [274].

[280] assumed that the virtual network varies faster than the awareness spreading, and the contact network varies slower than the epidemic spreading. Therefore, the activity-driven network [92] is used to describe the virtual network, and the contact network is still assumed to be static. Then, the awareness spreads on the temporal network according to the UAU model as proposed in Ref. [267]. The epidemic spreading dynamics on a contact network evolves as the model in Ref. [92]. Through a generalized MMCA approach, Guo et al. found that the metacritical point is bounded by [0,1\u2215(m(\u3008a\u3009+\u3008a2\u3009))\u00d7[0,1\u2215\u039bmax(B)], where \u3008a\u3009 and \u3008a2\u3009 are the first and second moments of the activity potential distribution.

            "text": "Different from the reversible SIS model, certain epidemics such as measles and chickenpox should be described by using the irreversible SIR model [1]. Wang et al. [281] assumed that the awareness spreads on a communication network (layer A), and the irreversible epidemic transmits through a contact network (layer B). For the awareness spreading dynamics, they used an SIR-like model. Specifically, each aware (or infected) node transmits the awareness to unaware (i.e., susceptible) neighbors with probability \u03bb1, and recovers with probability \u03b31=1. The unaware node becomes aware about the epidemic when its counterpart in the contact network is infected by the epidemic. For the epidemic spreading dynamics, an SIRV model is adopted. The infected nodes transmit the infection to susceptible neighbors with probability \u03bb2, and recover with probability \u03b32=1. A susceptible node iB in layer B becomes vaccinated if its counterpart in layer A becomes aware. Wang et al. developed a generalized heterogeneous mean-field theory to quantitatively describe the coevolution spreading dynamics. To obtain the outbreak threshold \u03bbc1 of the awareness spreading, Wang et al. used a linear approximation method, and got (41)\u03bbc1=\u3008k1\u3009\u2215(\u3008k12\u3009\u2212\u3008k1\u3009),for\u03bb2\u2264\u3008k2\u3009\u2215(\u3008k22\u3009\u2212\u3008k2\u3009)0,others.When computing the outbreak threshold of the epidemic in the thermodynamic limit, the competing percolation theory [104] is used. If the awareness does not outbreak, i.e., \u03bb1\u2264\u03bbc1, the epidemic outbreak threshold is \u03bbc2=\u3008k2\u3009\u2215(\u3008k22\u3009\u2212\u3008k2\u3009), which is the same as that when there is no awareness spreading [46]. When \u03bb1>\u03bbc1, there are two different situations: (i) If the epidemic spreads faster than the awareness, i.e., \u03bb2\u3008k1\u3009\u2215(\u3008k12\u3009\u2212\u3008k1\u3009)>\u03bb1\u3008k2\u3009\u2215(\u3008k22\u3009\u2212\u3008k2\u3009), the threshold is still \u03bbc2=\u3008k2\u3009\u2215(\u3008k22\u3009\u2212\u3008k2\u3009). (ii) If the awareness spreads faster than the epidemic, i.e., \u03bb2\u3008k1\u3009\u2215(\u3008k12\u3009\u2212\u3008k1\u3009)<\u03bb1\u3008k2\u3009\u2215(\u3008k22\u3009\u2212\u3008k2\u3009), the threshold is (42)\u03bbc2=\u3008kB\u3009(1\u2212pSA)(\u3008kB2\u3009\u2212\u3008kB\u3009),where SA is the fraction of the aware nodes in layer A, which can be obtained by using the bond percolation theory [46]. In the simulations, the communication network is generated by using the SF uncorrelated configuration model [282], and the contact network is an ER network. This coupled network is hereinafter called a SF\u2013ER network (i.e., the communication network is SF and the contact network is an ER network). As shown in Fig. 21, the theoretical predictions agree well with the simulations. One can observe that the final awareness outbreak size RA increases with \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, whereas the final epidemic outbreak size RB decreases with \u03bb1.",

They first proposed an approach to adjust the overlap and the cross-layer correlations in two-layer networks. Juher and Salda\u00f1a assumed that the awareness spreads on layer A and the epidemic spreads on layer B. The coevolution mechanisms of the awareness and epidemic are similar to the model in Ref. [281]. By contrast, for a pair of nodes with susceptible and infected states, the susceptible node reduces its infection probability to \u03bbo. They proposed a variant mean-field theory, where edges are divided into two categories: the ones existing in both networks are called common edges while the ones only in one network are called private edges. The epidemic outbreak threshold fulfills the following condition (43)\u3008k22\u3009\u3008k2\u3009\u03bb2(\u03b1)\u2212\u03b32=0,where \u03b1 is the overlap coefficient between the two layers, and \u03bb2(\u03b1)=11+\u03b1[\u03bb2(1\u2212\u3008k1\u3009\u3008k2\u3009\u03b1)+\u03bbo(1+\u3008k1\u3009\u3008k2\u3009)\u03b1].

            "text": "\nMost of the previous studies assumed that the adoption by individuals of vaccination or immunization behaviors only depends on their current perceptive awareness of the epidemic. Liu et al. [284] proposed a non-Markovian model that assumes the probability of adopting immunization behavior is dependent on the cumulative awareness, say \u03beM=\u03be1+(1\u2212\u03be1)[1\u2212e\u2212\u03b1(M\u22121)], where \u03be1 is the basic vaccination probability when a node receives the first piece of awareness on the communication network, and \u03b1>0 is used to reflect the strength of social reinforcement: a larger \u03b1 corresponds to stronger social reinforcement. By using the heterogeneous mean-field theory, Liu et al. showed that the awareness outbreak threshold is identical to that in Eq. (41), namely the social reinforcement has no effect on the threshold of awareness spreading. For the epidemic outbreak threshold, there are two different situations. (i) If the awareness cannot outbreak on the communication network, the epidemic outbreak threshold is \u03bbc2=\u3008k2\u3009\u2215(\u3008k22\u3009\u2212\u3008k2\u3009). (ii) If the awareness breaks out and the epidemic spreads faster than the awareness, the epidemic outbreak threshold does not change; otherwise, the epidemic outbreak threshold is (44)\u03bbc2=\u3008k2\u3009[1\u2212vB(\u221e)](\u3008k22\u3009\u2212\u3008k2\u3009),where vB(\u221e) is the fraction of vaccination nodes with \u03bb2=0. Because vaccination and infection incur some social cost, Liu et al. defined the social cost of the system as C=1N\u2211i=1N(cVVB,i+cRRB,i), where VB,i=1 means that node i is in the vaccination state, otherwise, VB,i=0. Analogously, RB,i=1 means that node i is in the recovered state, otherwise, RB,i=0. The parameters cV and cR denote the social unit cost of vaccination and treatment, respectively. There exists an optimal strength of the social reinforcement effect \u03b1o, at which the social cost C is minimized when \u03bb1>\u03bb2, as shown in Fig. 23(a). Similarly, in Fig. 23(b), \u03bb1 also exhibits a minimum value at \u03bb1o. The value of \u03b1o decreases with \u03bb1, and \u03bb1o decreases with \u03bb1, as shown in Fig. 23(c) and (d).",

Empirically, the coevolution of awareness and epidemics exhibits an asymmetric coupling between the two dynamics: the awareness suppresses the epidemic spreading, whereas the epidemic spreading promotes the awareness diffusion. For the coevolution on single networks, the network topology (e.g., degree distribution and clustering) remarkably affects the coevolution spreading dynamics. For the coevolution of awareness and epidemics on multiplex networks, the epidemic threshold of the UAU+SIS model has a critical value (i.e., the metacritical point), which is correlated with the awareness diffusion and the topology of the underlying network. In the SIR+SIR model, there exists an optimal awareness diffusion probability at which the epidemic spreading is maximally suppressed.",

            "text": "From the perspective of macroscopic resource cost in terms of vaccinations and the social welfare loss associated with epidemics, Francis et al. [289] solved an optimal control problem of suppressing the epidemic through vaccination while minimizing the total cost. The model is a standard SIR model incorporating an extra vaccination rate r(t), such that the susceptible can turn into the recovered state at this rate. Then, Francis et al. solved an optimal control problem to minimize the total cost during the disease process, where the total cost is a weighted summation of the cost of vaccination and the cost from loss of utility when people are infected. The resource regulation effects from both government policy and the market were discussed. In a more realistic scene, the resource allocation is performed on spatial districts. For example, the epidemic outbreaks may occur in different but interconnected regions. Under this setting, Mbah et al. [290] studied an optimal control model to minimize the discounted number of infected individuals during the course of an epidemic with economic constraints, and investigated preferential treatment strategies. Their model is a two-region SIRS model in which the infected can be cured with a cost. The discounted number has the form \u222b0\u221ee\u2212rt\u03c1(t)dt, where the discount rate r aims to give greater emphasis to control in the short rather than the long term. Mbah et al. discuss the optimal control problem to minimize the discounted numbers of the two regions with total budget constraints. Their results indicated that when faced with the dilemma of choosing between socially equitable and purely efficient strategies, the optimal control strategy is not apparent but should be determined by many epidemiological factors, such as the basic reproductive number and the efficiency of the treatment measure. Apart from multiple populations from different regions, the resource allocation can occur over multiple time periods. Zaric et al. [291], [292] studied a dynamic resource allocation model in which a limited budget is allocated over multiple time periods to interventions. The epidemic model is a generalized epidemic model with multiple compartments and the interventions turn to the changes in the model parameters. Through a heuristic numerical study, Zaric et al. found that allowing for some reallocation of resources or funds over the time horizon, rather than allocating resources just once at the beginning of the time horizon, can lead to significant increases in health benefits.",

A number of studies focus on studying the algorithm of the network distribution problem. Preciado et al. [293] proposed a model in which the infection rate of each individual can be reduced by distributing the vaccination resources to them (such that they become less infective). Thus, individuals in the SIS epidemic model in the network present different levels of susceptibility, depending on how many resources they gain. Considering how to minimize the total cost of the corresponding vaccination and the corresponding outbreak asymptotic exponential decaying rate, a convex framework to find the optimal distribution of vaccinations to contain the epidemics in arbitrary contact networks is proposed. In a similar study, Enyioha et al. [294] considered a linearized SIS epidemic spreading model with the setting that the resources can be used to reduce individual infection rates or/and to increase the recovery rates. Enyioha et al. proposed a distributed alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm to solve this problem, and obtained a distributed solution in which agents in the network were able to locally compute their optimal allocations.",

[295] analyzed how to best allocate limited resources to each node so as to minimize the epidemic prevalence. They formulated the SIS model by the mean-field theory and solved the corresponding optimal control problem by the Lagrange multiplier method, and found counterintuitively that in the strong infection region, the low-degree nodes should be allocated more medical resources than the high-degree nodes to minimize prevalence. The above models assume that resources can be distributed to reduce the infectiousness or increase the recovery of a node. A similar idea can also be conducted on the edges. Nowzari et al. [296] assumed that the epidemic spreading can be suppressed by decreasing the strength or weight of edges when allocating resources. For example, the government might be able to decrease the edge weight by reducing interactions between two nodes, such as by limiting the amount of transportation between two cities. Nowzari et al. considered an SIS epidemic model on time-varying networks and studied how to optimally allocate the budget to best combat the undesired epidemic within a given budget.

The evolution of epidemic on network B can be expressed similarly. Jiang et al. found that a significant fraction of the total population may be infected if the resource amount is below the resource threshold. Moreover, the resource threshold is dependent upon both the inter- and intra-connections of the two networks. It is found that the inter-layer infectious strength can lead to a phase transition from the discontinuous to the continuous phase or vice versa, whereas the internal infectious strength can result in a hybrid phase transition. Thus, the links between the two networks and the edges within a network play different roles in the resource-induced critical phenomena.",

In other words, there is a single central node in the system that controls healing. An infected node can heal if, and only if, it is connected to the central node via a path involving only healthy nodes. Interestingly, through numerical simulation, a two-phase behavior is observed such that the system converges to only one of two stationary states: either the whole population is healthy or it becomes completely infected. This gives rise to discontinuous jumps of different sizes in the infected population and larger jumps tend to emerge at lower infection rates. The discontinuous jumps can be understood by the fact that at some point, the central node may become surrounded by infected nodes, such that nodes outside cannot be cured, which leads to a sudden jump to a fully infected absorbing state.",

Bottcher et al. [302] proposed a budget-constrained SIS (bSIS) model, in which healthy individuals produce resources and infected individuals consume resources to recover. The bSIS model modifies the classical SIS dynamic by introducing a global budget b that can be increased by the number of healthy individuals per time step. There is a basic recovery process that is independent of the available budget, occurring at a rate \u03b30. Furthermore, each individual can recover through treatment and this requires a cost c. This resource-mediated recovery requires the budget. However, the rate of recovery through treatment is \u03b3bf(b), where f(b) is a function of the budget, satisfying f(b)=0 for b\u22640 and 0<f(b)\u22641 for b>0. With the mean-field assumption, the dynamics of the fraction of infected individuals is given by (47)d\u03c1(t)dt=k\u03b2\u03c1(t)s(t)\u2212[\u03b30+\u03b3bf(b)]\u03c1(t).\nFig. 25(a) shows an explosive epidemic where the entire population is infected in the steady state [\u03c1(\u221e)=1]. Furthermore, there is a discontinuous transition in the model parameters. For example, as illustrated in Fig. 25(b), the transition is discontinuous in the basic reproduction number. Therefore, there is a jump, \u0394\u03c1(\u221e), in the infection level (see Fig. 25(a)). The discontinuity of this jump in the final infected fraction \u03c1(\u221e) has important implications for the resilience of the healthy system and the control of the epidemic. It implies that small changes in the properties of the epidemic can abruptly increase the infection level, such that the epidemic is harder to control. In short, an insufficient resource production rate would induce the outbreak of the epidemic. Equivalently, the epidemic spreads out explosively if the cost of recovery is above a critical value.",

Taking into account the periodic outbreaks of flu-like epidemics and the limited effectiveness of vaccines, they studied models with seasonal updating and pre-emptive vaccination, in which individuals decide whether or not to get vaccinated before each epidemic season. The strategy for individuals is to determine whether or not they vaccinate. Although it requires a cost to vaccinate, individuals also bear the cost to treat the epidemic if they are infected when they do not receive vaccination. Once the epidemic ends, individuals update their vaccination decisions for the next season by imitating the strategy of their neighbors. The neighbor with a higher payoff has higher probability for their strategy to be learned, which is described by the famous Fermi rule in game theory [306]. By this rule, an individual, say i, updates his/her vaccination strategy by randomly choosing one of its immediate neighbors, say j, and adopts the strategy of j with the following probability determined by the payoff difference (48)y(vi\u2190vj)=11+exp[\u2212\u03c3(Pj\u2212Pi)],where vi=1 or 0 denotes the vaccination choice for individual i: either vaccinated or not, and Pi is the current payoff of individual i at the current season. Without any subsidy, according to the costs of vaccination and infection, we have (49)Pi=\u2212c,vaccination,\u22121,infected,0,freerider,where \u03c3 is a parameter characterizing the rationality of the individuals: higher \u03c3 implies more rational. By incorporating evolutionary games into epidemic dynamics, Zhang et al. found that under the partial-subsidy policy, the vaccination coverage depends monotonically on the sensitivity of individuals to payoff difference, \u03c3, but the dependence is nonmonotonic for the free-subsidy policy, referring to Fig. 26(c) and  26(d). For the case of irrational individuals where \u03c3=1, the free-subsidy policy can in general lead to higher vaccination coverage, referring to Fig. 26(a)\u2013(b).",

The effect of the resource is to decrease the initial number of susceptibles. As a game between selfish countries, each country aims to minimize its own outbreak size over the entire time horizon. Wang et al. mathematically analyze the model and show that the best strategy for selfish countries is to allocate all their resources to themselves to decrease their own effective reproduction ratio. Moreover, they further identify the mathematical conditions under which the total number of infected in the whole population is minimized by their the best strategy. In this case, even though each country selfishly seeks their own optimal strategy without communication, the global optimal situation can be achieved such that a major global outbreak may still be avoided.",

Consider the cases in which the recovery rate of infected nodes is heterogeneous in the sense that nodes with large degree tend to receive more (or less) resources, corresponding to \u03b1>0 and \u03b1<0, respectively. Through analysis and numerical simulations, Long et al. find that the virus spreading can be optimally suppressed if there is no such relation between the node degrees and resource amounts they received. In other words, if each healthy node contributes equal resources to the infected nodes, the virus can be optimally suppressed and there will be a maximum outbreak threshold and minimum fraction of infected nodes. Moreover, they find that in a homogeneous network, the uneven distribution of resources (if the recovery resources of infected nodes mainly rely on nodes with large or small degrees) would lead to a discontinuous phase transition, but the phase transition is continuous under even distribution of resources. However, heterogeneous networks always go through continuous transitions. In a similar scenario, Chen et al. [311] studied another model with a preferential effect. When the transmission rate is small, the resources of the healthy nodes should be allocated preferentially to the highly infectious nodes (nodes with more infected neighbors). When the transmission rate is large, in the early stage, resources should be allocated preferentially to the highly infectious nodes, whereas after the early stage, resources should be allocated to the less infectious nodes. With the individual resource diffusion framework, Chen et al. found that the allocation strategy can adaptively change with the current fraction of infected nodes and the epidemic can be maximally suppressed under the proposed strategy, which gives a novel viewpoint to the optimal epidemic control problem under resource constraints.",

At each time step, each healthy individual generates one resource unit, which are distributed equally to infected neighbors through the social layer and infected nodes consume all of the received resources to improve their recovery rate. The recovery rate of node i is \u03b3i(t)=\u03bcrRi(t)\u2215ki, where Ri(t) are the resources that node i receives from its healthy neighbors and \u03bcr\u2208[0,1] is an efficiency coefficient. Mathematically, the epidemic threshold can be approximately computed by a generalized dynamical message-passing approach based on the nonbacktracking matrix B of the contact layer. Under this approach, the epidemic threshold is given by (51)\u03b2c=1\u039bJ,where \u039bJ is the largest eigenvalue of J, defined as Jj\u2192i,l\u2192h=\u2212\u03b4lj\u03b4ih\u03bcr+\u03b2Bj\u2192i,l\u2192h, with \u03b4 being the Dirac delta function.

Here, \u03b2invI and \u03b2invII are the first and second thresholds, respectively. In addition, there are hysteresis loops in the phase transition. When the seed density is initially low, the epidemic breaks out at the invasion threshold \u03b2invI, but at the persistence threshold \u03b2per if it is initially high. When the fraction of edge overlap of the two layers is decreased (e.g., when me=0.2), a hybrid phase transition appears (see Fig. 27(c)). Note that when the edges of the two layers overlap completely (me=1.0) the infected density \u03c1 smoothly increases from 0 to 1 (see Fig. 27(d)).",

Resource consumption arises from the resource input to reduce the spreading rate and/or from the medical cost of curing to improve the recovery rate. The optimal solution of resource allocation can be found under constant resources. If the amount of total resources is limited, the epidemic may exhibit abrupt phase transitions at certain critical points, which is different from the traditional understanding that the optimal allocation strategy and its consequential outbreak size changes continuously with the total amount of resources. This critical phenomenon indicates that a slight lack of resource input may result in a catastrophic epidemic outbreak. In the case of coevolution, an inadequate resource production rate may cause an epidemic outbreak through abrupt phase transitions, similar to the case of inadequate constant resources. Individual behavior can induce complex coevolution dynamics with different types of critical phase transitions.

            "text": "The resilience of coevolution spreading is a potentially interesting topic. The resilience of a system is its ability to maintain its functions when some errors and attacks occur, or some environmental and dynamical parameters are changed [320]. Previous studies mainly focused on the resilience of single dynamics, such as epidemic spreading [321], biological dynamics [322], climate changes [323], and financial dynamics [324]. Pananos et al. [325] studied the critical dynamics in a population with vaccinating behavior by extracting data on measles-related tweets and Google searches. They revealed the critical slowing down and critical speeding up for coevolution dynamics, which are markedly different from single spreading. Because the resilience depends on the dynamical process, do there exist some common characteristics for the resilience of coevolution spreading dynamics? For a given coevolution spreading process, how might its resilience be estimated?",

For single spreading dynamics, some effective measures (e.g., H-index [326] and k-core [327]) and algorithms (e.g., PageRank [328], LeaderRank [329], collective influence [330], and some heuristic algorithms [331]) have been proposed. More detailed progress on vital node identification is presented in a recent review [27]. We should note that an effective vital node identification algorithm may not work for coevolution spreading dynamics. For instance, the nodes with high k-shell values are more likely to be the influential nodes; however, those nodes may inhibit the spreading when there exist asymmetrical interactions between two dynamics. Therefore, the vital node identification problem should be redefined and reanalyzed for coevolution spreading dynamics.",

In the clustered-lattice network, the red nodes share neighbors with each other, whereas in the random network, they do not. White nodes indicate individuals who are not connected to the focal node.
