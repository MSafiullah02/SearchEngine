            "text": "The adaptive cellular immune system is essential for the control of viral infections and plays a key role in the maintenance of antiviral immunity Ahmed and Gray, 1996, Zinkernagel and Hengartner, 1997. During the last decade, various novel methods have been developed to assess T cell responses. These new technologies, which include MHC tetramer staining (Altman et al., 1996), ELISPOT assays and intracellular cytokine staining in combination with flow cytometry Jung et al., 1993, Vikingsson et al., 1994, Prussin and Metcalfe, 1995, Nomura et al., 2000, greatly extend the classical tests such as T cell proliferation and T cell-mediated cytotoxicity (CTL) assays. The full array of assays is available for mouse and human, and is now being developed for rhesus macaques Moretto et al., 2000, Keeney et al., 2003. However, in most host species of veterinary importance the possibilities to measure the specificity and magnitude of the cellular immune response are limited. Clearly, rational vaccine design would benefit from these novel methodologies by allowing (i) the identification of relevant T cell antigens and (ii) the quantitative analysis of the cellular responses following immunization. Moreover, such assays would be of great value in molecular pathogenesis studies, most notably in those instances where viral infections of domestic animals serve as models for human disease. For example, feline immunodeficiency virus infection of cats provides an important and relevant model for HIV pathogenesis (Willet et al., 1997), while feline infectious peritonitis, a lethal coronaviral disease (de Groot and Horzinek, 1995), may serve in many respects as a model for human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).",

Moreover, cats represent an outbred population, for which MHC typing is not yet possible and for which syngeneic MHC-matched antigen-presenting cell lines are not readily available. In human and monkey infection models, the problem of haplotype diversity has been solved by using autologous PBMC or transformed B-lymphocytes as antigen-presenting cells Dyer et al., 1999, Larsson et al., 1999, Moretto et al., 2000. Here, we followed a similar approach to detect feline antiviral T cell responses. We describe a three-color flow cytometry assay to identify simultaneously virus-specific Th1 cytokine-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Stimulated cytokine-producing T cells were detected using a cross-reactive monoclonal antibody against human tumor necrosis factor \u03b1. As syngeneic stimulator cells, we used either SV40-immortalized autologous skin fibroblast cell lines, heterologously expressing the dedicated virus-receptor, or autologous PBMC and splenocyte preparations. Using these methods, we were able to demonstrate the presence of virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells both in the peripheral blood and spleen of cats, which had been infected experimentally with the feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus (FIPV). Moreover, in cats, immunized with a live attenuated feline calicivirus (FCV) vaccine, FCV-specific CD4+ T cells were detected in the spleen.",

We tested several commercial and non-commercial monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against feline IFN\u03b3, but none of these detected activated feline T cells in a flow cytometry assay (not shown). So far, mAbs against feline TNF\u03b1 have not been described. However, in contrast to IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1 is highly conserved among mammalian species. Feline and human TNF\u03b1 are closely related, sharing 89.7% amino acid sequence identity versus 78% and 78.4% with murine TNF\u03b1, respectively. This prompted us to test mouse mAb 6401.1111, which was raised against the human cytokine, for cross-reactivity with TNF\u03b1 of the cat. We employed the vaccinia virus-based vTF7-3 system (Fuerst et al., 1986) to express feline TNF\u03b1 heterologously. vTF7-3-infected mouse Ost7-1 cells were transfected at 1-h p.i. with expression vector pcDNA-fTNF, which carries the feline TNF\u03b1 coding sequence downstream of the bacteriophage T7 promotor. Cells were harvested at 6-h p.i. and stained intracellularly with APC-conjugated mAb 6401.1111. Flow cytometry analysis revealed specific staining of pcDNA-fTNF-transfected cells (\u223c25%) but not of mock-transfected cells (Fig. 1)\n.

Furthermore, the assay should be sensitive enough to measure memory T cells after vaccination. To test this, we analyzed the cellular immune responses in two cats which had been immunized subcutaneously with a live attenuated vaccine against feline calicivirus (FCV). FCV has been reported to infect lymphocytes (Kawaguchi et al., 1994). We therefore used PBMC and splenocyte preparations, infected with the homologous FCV strain F9, as APCs. No antiviral T cells were found in the peripheral blood (not shown). However, in the spleens of both vaccinated animals, FCV-specific TNF\u03b1-producing CD4+ T cells were observed (\u223c0.8% of the CD4+ population). FCV-specific CD8+ T cells were not detected (Fig. 5)\n.",

Usually, in this type of assay, stimulated T cells are identified by intracellular staining for IFN\u03b3 Vikingsson et al., 1994, Prussin and Metcalfe, 1995, Murali-Krishna et al., 1998. It is well established, however, that stimulated Th1-type T cells also produce TNF\u03b1 Slifka et al., 1999, Appay et al., 2000, Badovinac and Harty, 2000, Slifka and Whitton, 2000 and that staining for this cytokine provides a good alternative for the identification of activated T cells in mice, humans and macaques Badovinac and Harty, 2000, Nomura et al., 2000, Keeney et al., 2003, Nomura et al., 2003. As our initial attempts to detect SEB-stimulated T cells using various commercial and non-commercial antisera against feline IFN\u03b3 were unsuccessful, we explored the use of a commercially available mAb, raised against human TNF\u03b1. MAb 6401.1111 specifically stained feline TNF\u03b1-producing murine cells and also S. aureus Enterotoxin B-stimulated feline T cells, thus providing formal evidence for cross-reactivity. Cross-reactivity between a mAb against human TNF\u03b1 with the feline homologue has also recently been reported by Aguirre et al. (2003). By using allophycocyanin-conjugated mAb 6401.1111 in combination with PE- and FITC-conjugated mAbs against feline CD4 and CD8, respectively, antiviral T cells could be specifically identified in the peripheral blood and/or the spleens of FIPV-infected and of FCV-vaccinated cats.",

Previously, both primary and SV40-immortalized autologous skin fibroblasts have been successfully used in 51Cr-release CTL assays for feline leukemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus Flynn et al., 1994, Flynn et al., 2000, K\u00f6ksoy et al., 2001. Hence, the use of immortalized autologous fibroblasts as APCs for T cell stimulation seemed an obvious choice. The fibroblast cultures were fully permissive to FCV (not shown), but only 1% to 5% of the cells could be infected by FIPV strain 79-1146. To ensure that the cells were also FIPV-permissive, we generated continuous fibroblast cell lines, stably expressing the FIPV receptor CD13. The construction of cell lines for each individual animal is, however, labor-intensive. Therefore, a comparison was made with less elaborate approaches, in which PBMC or splenocytes served both as APC and effector cells. Virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were identified with all three procedures, but assays performed with splenocyte preparations consistently yielded the best results. As compared to stimulation with infected autologous fibroblast cell lines, stimulation with FIPV-infected splenocytes resulted in up to 3- and 11-fold increases in the number of stimulated TNF\u03b1-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively. One possible explanation for this difference is that fibroblasts are non-professional antigen presenting cells which, presumably, lack co-stimulatory molecules such as B7-1 and B7-2. In contrast, the FIPV-permissive dendritic cells and macrophages, present in splenocyte preparations, are specialized APCs fully competent to provide the required co-stimulation.",

It is possible that in hosts which have cleared an FIPV infection the numbers of virus-specific (memory) T cells within the spleen exceed those present in the periphery. In addition, the numbers of FIPV-permissive APCs, i.e. CD13+ monocytes and macrophages, may be lower in PBMC than in splenocyte preparations.

It is of note, however, that stimulation of splenocytes with FCV-infected autologous fibroblasts also failed to reveal antiviral CD8+ T cells (not shown). Most likely, the observed quality and quantity of the FCV-specific T cell responses are pertinent to the vaccine or to the vaccination route.
