More than 70 HAdV serotypes are further subdivided into seven species (A-G) [4, 5]; however, species B (HAdV-3,7,11 and 14), C (HAdV-1,2,5 and 6), and E (HAdV-4) are the ones most associated with respiratory infections [6]. Epidemiological studies have reported an approximately 5\u201310% HAdV-positive rate among acute respiratory tract infections in children [7, 8]. Adenovirus infections may in fact result in high morbidity and mortality in children, and fatality rates for untreated severe HAdV pneumonia or disseminated disease may exceed 50% [9]. Severe adenovirus infection in children can be complicated with pleural effusions [10], acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [11], respiratory failure [2], myocarditis [12], and central nervous system dysfunction [13], leading to either mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal life support, even death. Unfortunately, effective adenoviral vaccine for children and specific antiviral drugs against human adenoviruses are currently not available.",

Epidemiology of the disease suggests that HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 are the major types responsible for lower respiratory diseases in children less than 5 years old worldwide [2, 3, 7, 8]. In Beijing, China, HAdV-3, and HAdV-7 were the most common serotypes causing pneumonia from 1958 to 1990 [14]. In Chongqing, China, 53.9% of the HAdV-7-infected patients were diagnosed as having severe pneumonia, significantly higher than the 26.9% of the HAdV-3-infected patients from 2009 to 2014 [3]. In Taiwan, HAdV-3 and HAdV-7, causing complication with respiratory failure, accounted for 53% of infected children; seven cases due to HAdV-7 were among ten deaths reported in a single year, between 2010 and 2011 [2]. In Korea, both HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 cause epidemics of severe lower respiratory tract infections in young children. Overall, 16 and 39%, of the children infected with HAdV-3 and HAdV-7, respectively, required mechanical ventilation [15].",

The sequences of primers and probes for qPCR and the amplification conditions have been detailed [22, 23]. The real-time HAdV primer sequences were as follows: HAdV-3 forward, 5\u2032- GGGAGACAATATTACTAAAGAAGGTTTGC-3\u2032, HAdV-3 reverse, 5\u2019-CAACTTGAGGCTCTGGCTGATA-3\u2032. The sequence of the HAdV-3 probe was 5\u2019-CACTAC\u201cT\u201dGAAGGAGAAGAAAAGCCCATTTATGCC, which was labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and internally quenched at \u201cT\u201d with Black Hole Quencher-1 on the 5\u2032- end and phosphate on the 3\u2032-end. The forward primer sequences of HAdV-7 were 5\u2019-GAGGAGCCAG ATATTGATATGGAATT-3\u2032, The reverse primer sequences of HAdV-7 were: 5\u2019-AATTGACATTTTCCGTGTAAAGCA-3\u2032, and probe, 5\u2019-AAGCTGCTGACGCTTTTTCGCCTGA-3\u2032. The HAdV-7 probe was labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) on the 5\u2032-end and 3\u2032-terminally quenched with Black Hole Quencher-1. The thermal cycling condition was as follows: one cycle of 3 min at 95 \u00b0C; 45 cycles of 15 s at 95 \u00b0C; and 1 min at 60 \u00b0C.",

In this model, assays of viral load in the lung tissues revealed that virus copies of HAdV-7-infected groups were higher than those of HAdV-3-infected groups at 3, 5 and 7 days of infection, particularly on day 3, when virus copies in the HAdV-7 group were 1.5-fold higher than the HAdV-3 group (P < 0.05) (Fig. 4a). Pulmonary inflammation in mice was also observed following HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 infection at each time point and found to gradually increase from day 3 to day 5, decreasing on day7. Compared with HAdV-3-infected mice, lung tissue damage of HAdV-7-infected mice was also higher on all days of infection (Fig. 4b). Consistent with the morphological changes, the total number of cells in BALF was higher, compared with those in the control group on all days (P < 0.001) (Fig. 4c-e); importantly, the HAdV-7 group showed a significantly greater increase in these cells, in comparison with the HAdV-3 group (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4d-e). Specifically, abundant macrophages and smaller number of lymphocytes, neutrophils infiltrated into the BALF at all days post-infection. Whereas the neutrophils registered a slight rise, only on day 3, followed by dramatic decrease, the lymphocyte and macrophage numbers remained persistently elevated through days 5 and 7. In addition, macrophages in BALF of the HAdV-7 group were significantly higher than the HAdV-3 group after 5 and 7 days of infection (Fig. 4d-e), while the lymphocytes exhibited significant difference only on day 5 (P < 0.05) (Fig. 4d). Neutrophils in BALF of the HAdV-7 group was not significantly different compared with that of the HAdV-3 group at all time points (Fig. 4c-e). Together, these results showed that HAdV-7 infection induced a relatively more severe acute airway inflammation.",

In the present study, coinfection with HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 with other respiratory viruses accounted for half of the pediatric cases, but coinfection per se did not result in a difference in clinical manifestation or severe clinical outcomes. These results and the severe respiratory diseases and complications, which we identified with HAdV-7 infection in hospitalized children, were all consistent with previous reports [2, 3, 11, 15]. Remarkably, we also found a higher rate (19.1%) of toxic encephalopathy associated with HAdV-7 infection. Previous studies in Japan showed that mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS) could be triggered by adenovirus infection [26, 27], which was proposed to be caused by neurotoxins, likely acting as an antigen that induced a strong immune response, leading to a series of symptoms. Recently, silkworm chrysalis ingestion was shown to induce toxic encephalopathy [28]; however, our results constitute the first reported case of toxic encephalopathy associated with adenoviral infection. Earlier studies reported that several viruses, including adenoviruses, influenza A virus, parainfluenza virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus, can use the olfactory nerve as a shortcut into the central nervous system, causing infection of nerve cells and induction of immune response [29]; however, the exact mechanisms of such neurotropic infections remain to be elucidated.",

First of all, the results of cellular infectivity (Fig. 1a) indicated that A549, 16HBE, and HEK-293 are susceptible cell lines for the growth of adenovirus ex vivo. Furthermore, a difference of viral loads recorded in A549 and 16HBE cell lines between adenovirus 3 and 7 indicated differential inflammatory reactions were produced from infection of host respiratory epithelial cells by HAdV stimulated the innate immune system that might partially explain the role of HAdV-7 infection in the pathogenesis of a more severe pneumonia. This is likely because the airway epithelial cells not only serve as a passive barrier to infectious particles but also actively participate in the innate immune response to foreign antigens. The immune response of epithelia to infection and antigen exposure involves the release of chemokines and cytokines into the submucosa, which initiates an inflammatory reaction [30]. The results of co-infection of the two viruses indicated that distinctive fitness is type-specific and not interaction. The result of cell viability also provided useful information that was important for understanding type-specific viral virulence (Fig. 2). Taken together, we conclude that the differences observed in the replication, fitness, and virulence of the two adenoviruses are dependent on virus type.",

            "text": "The complement system plays important roles in innate immunity and is vital in the protection against invading pathogens. The complement cascade can be initiated through three main pathways: classical, lectin, and alternative. The classical pathway is mainly antibody-dependent. It is activated by interaction of C1q (a subunit of the first complement protein C1) with the Fc portion of the IgM or IgG immune complex, although activation can also be achieved in an antibody-independent manner by some membrane components of viruses, bacteria and fungi. The lectin pathway is first activated when the mannose-binding lectin, a structural homologue of C1q, binds to carbohydrate moieties on the surface of pathogens, including yeast, bacteria and viruses. The alternative pathway is antibody-independent; it is spontaneously activated on biological surfaces, as well as in plasma and other body fluids, when the level of C3 hydrolysis remains consistently low. This spontaneous cleavage readily initiates amplification of the activation cascades [31]. Although every pathway is triggered independently, all of the complement cascades culminate in the central cleavage of C3 and the generation of its active fragments C3a and C3b, which can bind covalently to viral components to aid in opsonization and phagocytosis. Furthermore, complement activation also mediates the inflammatory reaction via the generation of anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a) and recruitment of inflammatory cells to the site of infection [32, 33]. Therefore, activation of the complement system leads to inflammation, opsonization, and membrane perturbation.",

For each of these viruses, C3 played an essential role in effective in vitro neutralization by normal human serum (NHS). Here, we explored human adenovirus-induced complement activation to test whether there are differences in infectious HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 in vitro with normal human serum (that contain anti-adenovirus antibodies). As our results demonstrate, higher C3a levels, observed in HAdV-7 infection, rapidly activated human complement within 2 min.

Our current study has addressed whether different types of human adenovirus infection result in distinct inflammatory reactions in vivo. In this study, we clearly observed robust virus growth, and also documented significantly higher viral load in HAdV-7-infected mice at 3 days post-infection. These results are different from those reported by Kajon et al. in which only low levels of HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 replication were seen at the early stage of infection in mice [39]. We speculate that the apparent discrepancy is due to the effect of different experimental animal models and detection methods used. Adenovirus infection is characterized pathologically by a time-dependent progression in the type of inflammatory cells present. The initial inflammation is a neutrophilic interstitial infiltration with neutrophilic alveolitis. Subsequently, monocytes become evident and, finally, predominantly lymphocytic infiltrates appear. During the acute stage of HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 infection, we also found that the total number and classes of cells in BALF increased, primarily accounted for by macrophages. Neutrophils only transiently increased at 3 days post-infection. A mixture of mononuclear cells (macrophages and lymphocytes) exclusively became evident at 5 and 7 days post-infection. Macrophages were most prominent than neutrophils and lymphocytes at all time points. These results are fully consistent with several studies, including those of Kajon et al., which showed that HAdV-3 and HAdV-7-induced pneumonia mainly produces neutrophil infiltration at 1 and 2 days post-infection, and affects macrophages [39]. Apart from phagocytosing and killing the pathogens, macrophages also secrete chemokines to recruit cells to the sites of infection. Yoon et al. found that adenovirus type 7 produced a more robust IL-6 and IL-8 response than adenovirus 3 in human bronchial epithelial cells [1, 30]. Diaz et al. compared cytokine responses between type 7 and type 3, and documented significantly higher production of interferon-\u03b3 from type 7 [40]. Similarly, subsequent production of IL-1\u03b2, induced by macrophages, also reached the highest levels after 3, 5, and 7 days of HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 infection. Asgari et al. have reported that engagement of the C3a receptor triggers IL-1\u03b2 processing and release via caspase-1 activation [41]. The results are consistent with the immune response of the epithelia to adenovirus infection and antigen exposure, which involves the release of chemokines and cytokines into the submucosa and initiates an inflammatory reaction. Lastly, complement activation mediates the inflammatory reaction via anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a) and recruitment of inflammatory cells to the site of infection. The inflammation then leads to the recruitment of phagocytes that help clear the invaders. Collectively, we conclude that these innate immune responses play an important role in the initial defense against adenovirus infection.",

The data presented herein only interrogated virological differences; however, adenovirus infection is a very complex process that involves not only the structural proteins of the virus, such as fiber, hexon, and penton, but also includes host and environmental factors. Nonetheless, our data confirm that severe adenovirus infection was associated with HAdV-7 rather than HAdV-3. The significance of the study lies in that the pediatrician should be aware of the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of HAdV-7 infection in children in clinical practice. The findings should also stimulate further studies of mechanisms of the different pathogenicity among human adenovirus serotypes.",
