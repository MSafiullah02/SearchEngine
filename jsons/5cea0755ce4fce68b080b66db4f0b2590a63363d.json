Full blood counts will be performed only in patients with signs of severity and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. As 50-75 % of patients with acute leukemia are febrile at diagnosis [3] , they are at high risk of missed or delayed diagnosis. This also applies to other oncological conditions such as primary mediastinal lymphoma or lung cancer, which often present with a cough with or without fever, symptoms that are likely to be considered trivial after a negative SARS-CoV-2 test.",

Delay in chemotherapy initiation may negatively affect prognosis, particularly in young (< 60 years-old) patients with favorable-or intermediate-risk disease. Indeed, they could progress to high-risk disease following the acquisition of additional genetic anomalies, and hyperleukocytosis (or increased blasts count in MDS) [4, 5] . More treatments may then be needed to achieve a deep complete remission before allogeneic stem cell transplantation.",

Delays in the identification of compatible donors are expected and represent a particular challenge when siblings are abroad. The use of home swab kits is a vital resource to enable HLA testing, particularly when access to hospitals for family is restricted. All future donors need to be tested for COVID-19. These aspects have recently been reviewed in detail elsewhere [6, 7] . Deferring allogeneic HSCT is recommended if possible; however, transmission from donor to recipient, either in the transfusion of blood products or cellular therapies, has not been yet reported [8] . Literature data on the impact of delayed transplant is ambiguous, obscured by differences in stem cell source and disease subtype. However, if a delay in transplant results in the reappearance of a significant minimal residual disease (MRD), a negative impact on survival is well established [9] . Furthermore, to ensure the possibility of the graft, EBMT strongly recommends securing stem cell product by freezing HSCs prior to conditioning, or to have a back-up donor [7] . It is not presently known if cryo-conservation would negatively impact engraftment success; the use of less favorable stem cell sources in case of optimal donor unavailability might.",
