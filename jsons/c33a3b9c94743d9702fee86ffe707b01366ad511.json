In some patients, disease progression leads to an enormous secretion of cytokines, known as cytokine storm, among those cytokines IL-6 plays an important role. Here the author shows how IL-6 has both pro and anti-inflammatory properties, depending on the pathway of transduction: soluble (transsignaling) or membrane-related (classic signaling), and suggests how targeting only the pro-inflammatory pathway, with SGP130Fc, could be a better option then targeting them both. Other possible IL-6 pathway inhibitors such as Ruxolitinib and Baricinitib are then analyzed, underlying how they lack the benefit of targeting only the pro-inflammatory pathway.",

If that is the case, targeting the coronavirus alone with antiviral therapy might not be sufficient to reverse highly pathogenic infections 5 . These observations led to explore the usage of therapies that included interferons type I and II. Interferon beta displayed the best efficacy in reducing MERS-CoV replication in tissue culture 6, 7 . A randomized control trial is ongoing in South Arabia (MIRACLE Trial) to determine whether the combination of antivirals used in HIV infection such as Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Interferon beta could improve clinical outcomes in MERS-CoV infections 8 . In a humanized transgenic mouse MERS-CoV infection model, Remdesivir (a drug already being used against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with severe and moderate disease, GS-US-540-5773/4 Studies) showed more activity and efficacy in prophylactic and therapeutic use then the combination of Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Interferon beta 9 , this points towards the necessity to explore other options regarding immune system modulation and how control of viraemia is also essential.",

Especially IL-6 can induce the hyper-innate inflammatory response due to the SARS-CoV-1 invasion of the respiratory tract 20 . Interestingly, in human epithelial cells, SARS-CoV-1 was able to induce greater IL-6 when compared to influenza A virus 21 . Although in some murine viral infections IL-6 plays a protective and essential role in the resolution process, in others like in SARS-CoV-1 high levels of IL-6 were associated with severe inflammation and correlated with mortality in the mice 22, 23 . This happens also with SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients: some retrospective and meta-analysis studies show how elevated IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) correlate with mortality and severe disease in comparison to moderate disease [24] [25] [26] [27] . More evidence suggests that critically ill patients with severe respiratory failure and SARS-CoV-2 have either immune dysregulation or macrophage-activation syndrome, both of which are characterized by pro-inflammatory cytokines. The immune dysregulation, in particular, is driven by the Interleukin-6 (IL- 6) and not by Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) 27 . Two key features of this immune dysregulation are: over-production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by monocytes and lymphocyte dysregulation with CD4 lymphopenia 27 .",

Some animal models showed that when IL-6 was acting via the membrane bound IL-6R (classic signaling) it did so in a protective way, they also showed that inhibiting trans-signaling was superior to global blockade of IL-6 activity by neutralizing antibodies 56 , this was done using the IL-6 trans-signaling inhibitor sgp130Fc, which is a fusion protein of the gp130 with the Fc portion of a human immunoglobulin antibody 57, 58 . In a murine polymicrobial sepsis model, selective blockade of IL-6 trans-signaling with sgp130Fc improved survival up to 100%. Interestingly, treating these mice with anti-IL-6R antibodies did not prevent death of the mice 56 . This is a first hint of how targeting only the IL-6R with drugs like Tocilizumab might not be enough in a sepsis infectious model. Furthermore, it all points to the trans-signaling transduction being the harmful one (proinflammatory response), and the classic signaling transduction being the protective one (anti-inflammatory response) 59 . More evidence of that in some studies showing that elevated serum levels of IL-6, which are a marker of disease severity in the inflammatory acute lung injury during acute pancreatitis, were mediated by the trans-signaling transduction way, as sgp130Fc blocked the pancreatitis induced acute lung injury 60 .",

In contrast, selective blockade of IL-6 trans-signaling with the sgp130Fc protein did not result in increased bacterial titers, and thus was concluded that the classic signaling was involved in the protection of the body from bacterial infection 71 .",

It has been shown that the blockade of IL-6 trans-signaling using sgp130Fc was as efficient as the global blockade of IL-6 classic and trans-signaling using specific monoclonal antibodies 72 . SGP130Fc is mainly used in chronic inflammatory diseases (such as intestinal inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, neuroinflammation and cancer 51 ), but it has shown its efficacy also in acute inflammation 57 rate. This demonstrate that trans-signaling, rather than classic signaling, contributes to malaria lethality in mice 74 . IL-6 trans-signaling is also involved in the infiltration of granulocytes and macrophages during the late phase of an acute inflammation, and this happens when the trans-signaling triggers the secretion of chemokine MCP-1 in endothelial cells 57 ",

The next step after binding of IL-6 to IL-6R and sgp130 is then to initiate intracellular signal transduction. The signal transfer is performed by the Janus-kinase/Signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak/STAT)-,mainly STAT1, STAT3 isoforms [78] [79] [80] , mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-and phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-pathway 44, 77 . Another possible way of counteracting IL-6 action is then to inhibit its intracellular transduction pathway, though in doing so the benefit of specifically targeting the pro-inflammatory trans-signaling pathway is lost. This can be done by inhibiting the JAK 1/2 pathway with drugs like Ruxolitinib. Ruxolitinib is a small drug belonging to the class of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and currently clinically used in the treatment of JAK2 mutated myeloproliferative neoplasms, including myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera 81, 82 . It shows activity against the JAK2 isoform and also the JAK1 isoform, which plays a major role in the signaling pathway of inflammatory cytokines 83 . JAK3 seems to be less sensitive to ruxolitinib 84 , it also shows anti-inflammatory activity which may be beneficial in its clinical use 85 ; it is also implicated in the suppression of the harmful consequences of macrophage activation hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis 86 , which is an underrecognized hyperinflammatory syndrome characterized by fulminant and fatal hypercytokinemia with multi organ failure 87 . It has been proven that the expression of major inflammatory cytokines such as TNF alfa and IL6 was highly reduced in inflammatory human macrophages exposed to ruxolitinib 85 . It has also been shown through an analysis of mRNA expression of cytokines by PCR array that the major inflammatory cytokines , IL-6 and TNF alfa, were highly reduced and down-regulated by ruxolitinib at both protein and mRNA level 88 .",

Here also other possible choices in counteracting IL-6 mediated activities are shown, like Ruxolitinib and Baricitnib, in the hope to find new possible strategies and discovering new properties of the drugs already available, since this would mean accelerating clinical trials as their side effects and tolerability in humans are already known. Figure1 . This diagram shows the classic signaling pathway (mediated by the membrane-bound form of IL-6 receptor, mIL6R) which is believed to be the antiinflammatory one and the trans-signaling pathway (mediated by the soluble form of IL-6 receptor, sIL6-R) which is believed to be the pro-inflammatory one. Tocilizumab inhibits both of them, SGP130Fc inhibits only the trans-signaling pathway.",

Since high levels of IL-6 are associated with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infections as shown above and since high serum levels of IL-6 have been associated with lung lesions in SARS-CoV-2 patients in the acute and later stages 20, 24-27, 42 , a valid option could be targeting the expression of IL-6 with Tocilizumab a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 Receptor: this option is currently being used in some patients in Italy with important lung injuries (TOCIVID-19 study). Tocilizumab is currently approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases 43 . This option should be approached only when there are radiological and clinical signs of progression of the lung lesions. Time decision as when to start clinical administration of anti-IL-6 drugs is maybe the most important decision in this scenario, since as mentioned before in murine models IL-6 is essential in the early stages of other infections to control disease progression 19 . The inclusion criteria for Tocilizumab administration for the TOCIVID trial in Italy, and for trials in other countries are summarized in Table1. Here instead are the recommendation criteria used to decide when a patient should be given Tociluzumab, written by the Italian Society of Infectious and tropical diseases (SIMIT, Societ\u00e0 Italiana di Malattie Infettive e Tropicali) last update to 13 March 2020:",

In a murine model of IL-6R deficient mice the infection showed an increase in survival of otherwise lethal blood-stage malaria. Inducing IL-6 trans-signaling by injection of mouse recombinant soluble IL-6R in deficient mice restores the lethal outcome. In contrast, inhibition of IL-6 trans-signaling via injection of sgp130Fc protein in wild type mice results in 40% survival",
