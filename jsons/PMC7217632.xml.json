Of note, the authors report that around 10% of patients presented with gastrointestinal symptoms without respiratory features when infected with SARS-CoV-2. These patients were more likely to have a delayed diagnosis, leading to potential problems for themselves and individuals with whom they came into contact.",

For example, Wu and colleagues6 showed that 41 (55%) of 74 patients had SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive faecal samples; whereas the respiratory samples of these patients remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA for a mean of 16\u00b77 days, their faecal samples remained positive for a mean of 27\u00b79 days. One patient had RNA-positive faecal samples for 33 days after their respiratory samples became RNA-negative, and another patient tested RNA-positive in their faecal sample for 47 days after symptom onset. The presence of gastrointestinal symptoms was not correlated with faecal sample viral RNA positivity and severity of disease was also not correlated with extended duration of faecal sample viral RNA positivity.",

However, two major questions remain to be answered. First, how long can SARS-CoV-2 survive in faeces? van Doremalen and colleagues8 analysed the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols and on various surfaces, and found that the virus remained viable in aerosols for 3 h. The viability of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces depended on the type of surface. In the simulated environment in the laboratory, no viable SARS-CoV-2 was detected after 4 h on copper and after 24 h on cardboard. SARS-CoV-2 was more stable on plastic and stainless steel, with viable virus detectable for up to 72 h. However, there are currently no data showing how long SARS-CoV-2 remains viable in faeces.",
