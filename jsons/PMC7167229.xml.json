In each case there is a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for those scientists involved in drug discovery. A lack of available antivirals to treat the infected patients leads to a clamoring to test anything available, and some pharmaceutical companies charge in to offer their drugs. We also seem to see similar patterns in response across outbreaks. There is a rush to be \u2018first\u2019 and this sense of priority might not lead to the best or even any outcome for patients. Always, there is the immediate proposal to create a vaccine and pronouncements that this will be available in a short time or by the end of the year of the actual outbreak in question; and it never happens within these optimistic artificial deadlines. Again, we have experienced this with the current outbreak. For Ebola the vaccine was ready for the second outbreak and has now been approved [6].",

In the case of SARS-CoV-2 it results in pneumonia [7] and shares aspects of pathology and pathogenesis with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [8]. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV belong to the same family Coronaviridae and genus Betacoronavirus. Several drug companies immediately made their antivirals available. For example, Abbvie made their HIV approved drug lopinavir/ritonavir combination available to the Chinese government [9]. This drug had previously been suggested as promising based on combination study results from a marmoset study [10]. Publications have already appeared describing the use of this drug in a patient in Korea, significantly decreasing the viral load [11]. Simultaneously, Gilead made available remdesivir, which had previously failed in clinical trials for Ebola [12] but had recently shown activity against MERS in rhesus macaques [13]. Remdesivir, chloroquine and several other drugs were tested in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1\n) and shown to be active [14]. Some researchers had also suggested as early as January 2020 what treatment options might be most likely and these included lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, favilavir, arbidol, as well as a broad array of nucleoside analogs, neuraminidase inhibitors, peptides, RNA synthesis inhibitors, anti-inflammatory drugs and traditional Chinese medicines 15, 16, 17.",

Already in the past weeks we have seen the rapid spread to Italy and from there to many other countries including Brazil and beyond. Such virus outbreaks are greatly straining the healthcare systems of affected countries and will test every aspect of our infrastructure, supply chains and preparedness [20]. This raises the question of what we can learn from our past drug discovery efforts in an attempt to develop additional drugs for SARS-CoV-2 more efficiently. The acceleration of global SARS-Cov-2 data generation, effectively just in a couple of months, has been remarkable. However, scientific information gaps that impede progress toward small-molecule treatments can still be perceived. Many of these persist from when they were first outlined for Ebola back in 2015 [21]. We can thus make some \u2018then-and-now\u2019 comparisons (see Supplementary material Figs. S1\u2013S4 and Table S1 online) as well as share our own experiences of research on these virus outbreaks.",

            "text": "An early drug [22] identified by these screens was the antimalarial amodiaquine, which was subsequently shown to be associated with decreased mortality [27], as the drug (artesunate/amodiaquine) was used for malaria treatment in some Ebola patients, whereas others took a different malaria medicine (artemether/lumefantrine) [27]. Our Ebola machine learning models were used to select three molecules for in vitro testing [28]. We identified pyronaridine, tilorone and quinacrine as having good in vitro activity (nM) against the Ebola virus [28]. These preliminary data enabled us to obtain funding from the NIH to take one of the compounds through in vivo testing. We also leveraged NIH support to a collaborator to test the other two compounds as well. These molecules were then each tested in the mouse model for Ebola infection and demonstrated significant efficacy 29, 30, 31. Pyronaridine is currently being pursued in larger animal models of Ebola virus infection. Working on computational models through to in vitro testing happened in the space of a few months, whereas it took several years to obtain funding for our first mouse studies. This is by no means a streamlined approach to drug discovery but it was cost effective for the amount of data ultimately generated and led to revitalized interest in these molecules.",

This was followed by our homology modeling of every Zika virus protein [33] weeks before the first crystal structures for Zika proteins were released. All of this work was performed in the open and it attracted the attention of the IBM World Community Grid team who requested we submit a proposal to them for a Zika project using their distributed computing facilities. This became the OpenZika project led by our team in Brazil and the USA and it involved the docking of millions of molecules from the ZINC database in all Zika virus and related flavivirus protein crystal structures [34]. We have since also performed further modeling of Zika proteins [35] and an analysis of the first 2 years following the outbreak [36].

We would pick fewer targets to dock molecules into as the OpenZika project created billions of docking results for tens of targets that will take many years to process. We would also suggest that it is best to work with high-resolution crystal structures versus homology models as soon as possible. We would also start with a library of commercially available drugs and antivirals, this would massively limit the number of molecules docked to a few thousand because we found that docking of the ZINC library available at that time led to compounds that were not readily available. Focused libraries are interesting options to perform target-directed virtual screening. Examples are ChemDiv [38] and Asinex [39] databases, which have specific subsets for protease inhibitors, for example facilitating and accelerating the experimental screening. During OpenZika we learnt that having multiple biology labs committed to doing testing in vitro is also very important to have access to experimental results more quickly to validate the computational approach. Working with the IBM World Community Grid did not include any funding. We found it very difficult to obtain NIH funding to support this project from the very beginning (because it was computational) and also attempted small business grants with academic collaborators without success, even though we were leveraging massive computational resources through the World Community Grid. We would recommend that open efforts like this need some funding for in vitro validation. Millions of dollars have been invested by the NIH to fund other Zika research projects since the 2016 outbreak and there is as yet no small molecule of note in the drug discovery pipeline [36]. There is still therefore an unmet medical need for treatments for Zika virus and computational efforts could aid this and be cost-effective.",

This type of strategy was attempted for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV 60, 61 and the repurposing of host-based therapies has also been proposed for coronaviruses [62]. Several studies have screened a few hundred molecules and tested the activity against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV (Table 2\n) 63, 64. The first screen of 348 FDA-approved drugs identified four FDA-approved drugs including chloroquine, chlorpromazine, loperamide and lopinavir [63]. At the same time, a second study screened 290 compounds and identified 27 FDA- and non-FDA-approved drugs including chloroquine among the many hits [64], and the Abl2 kinase inhibitors such as imatinib which impacts the early stages of infection after internalization and endosomal trafficking. This latter molecule appears to work by inhibiting fusion at the viral membrane [65]. Chloroquine is widely used for malaria and loperamide is used for diarrhea. These represent drugs that are readily available in many locations around the world and for which physicians are also familiar with the side-effect profile. The ligand datasets from these and other screens can be used to apply machine learning methods to produce predictive models that can then be used to screen compound libraries and suggest new compounds to test. As an example, we have developed several models for ACE2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV using our Assay Central software 66, 67, 68, 69 which uses ECFP6 descriptors and the Bayesian algorithm (Fig. 3\n, the experimental details are described in the Supplementary material online; the Bayesian models are also available at http://models.collabchem.com/8/). The advantage of this approach is that the method is fast, does not require crystal structures and it enables small-molecule structures to be scored against many models simultaneously.",

However, it is neither trivial to get a definitive list of these structures in silico prepared for docking or to acquire these as a physical collection ready for screening (even though there are various repurposing subsets available from vendors). Notwithstanding, an approximation to a definitive approved set can be selected in PubChem as the intersect between curated drug resources such as DrugBank, DrugCentral and the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY, with totals of 9135, 4012 and 7674 molecules, respectively. The three-way compounds-in-common total is 1119 chemical identifiers (CID). PubChem indicates that 1197 molecules are available from chemical vendors. Relaxing the stringency of the repurposing provides triage steps that can certainly be useful for docking and/or machine learning or other modeling efforts. In this case the union of all three drug curation sources is 16\\,468. Other drug-centric solutions include the selection of 9527 international non-proprietary names (INN) CID.

For example we have now taken the opportunity to dock FDA-approved HIV-1 protease inhibitors (amprenavir, atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir and tipranavir) and hepatitis C NS3/4A protease inhibitors (asunaprevir, boceprevir, grazoprevir, paritaprevir, simeprevir and telaprevir) into the Mpro structure of SARS-CoV-2. The docking was performed with two different commercial docking software products: Biovia Discovery Studio and Schr\u00f6dinger Glide 70, 71, 72, 73, and the best docking results were compared (see Supplementary material Table S2 online). The results of both docking approaches indicated that azatanavir and lopinavir could be of most interest for in vitro or in vivo testing (Fig. 4\n). Atazanavir can interact with Mpro by H-bonding at Cys145 and the amide group. The aromatic ring of atazanavir (LigandFit score of 191.196) also formed hydrophobic interactions with residues Cys44, Met49, Leu50, Tyr54 and Cys145. In relation to lopinavir (LigandFit score of 175.497), H-bonds were established between residues Cys145 and Glu166 and nitrogen atoms of carbamate groups. Similar hydrophobic interactions were observed with lopinavir (Fig. 4). In China and South Korea lopinavir 200 mg/ritonavir 50 mg has already been used for the treatment of COVID-19. From the day after lopinavir/ritonavir administration, the viral load started to decrease and no detectable or little coronavirus titers have been observed since then [11]. Lopinavir, co-formulated with ritonavir is commercially available and known as Kaletra\u00ae around the world\u2013it is on formularies for HIV. By contrast, atazanavir is less commonly used. Kaletra\u00ae can be widely produced and distributed quickly through existing channels but it will be important to ensure HIV patients do not lose access to the medications they need. It is also a medication that clinicians are familiar with in terms of side effects, unlike other less commonly used medications. A broader analysis of all FDA-approved drugs docked in this protease structure could point to further drugs worth testing.",

Because there was only one Cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein with low resolution (3.46 \u00c5) without the human ACE2 protein [48] at the time of doing this analysis, we preferred to build a model by homology modeling, because lower-resolution structures (3 \u00c5 or higher) show the basic contours of the protein chain and the atomic structure must be inferred. We built the SARS-CoV-2 Spike subunit S1 model using the SwissModel server [74]. The template used was the SARS-CoV Spike S1 protein (PDB ID 2GHV) [75], which has resolution of 2.2 \u00c5 and 73.22% of sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. After the protein refinement, we added the human ACE2 protein to the model, based on the SARS-CoV Spike\u2013ACE2 structure (PDB ID 2AJF) [76], and built the full SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1\u2013ACE2 model (see Fig. S5 in Supplementary material online). The quality statistics of the modeled SARS-CoV-2 Spike\u2013ACE2 were good: 96.53% of the residues lie in the most favorable regions of the Ramachandran plot and the Molprobity score was 1.66. Our SARS-CoV-2 Spike\u2013ACE2 model is available (see Supplemental material PDB file online). Subsequently, we performed docking-based virtual screening with a grid centered at the Spike\u2013ACE2 interface. As can be seen in Table 3\n, docking scores indicated that rizatriptan (an antimigraine agent, Glide score = \u22127.49 kcal mol\u22121), dasabuvir (an antiviral for hepatitis C, Glide score = \u22127.92 kcal mol\u22121), pravastatin (a lipid-lowering agent, Glide score = \u22127.81 kcal mol\u22121) and empagliflozin (a hypoglycemic agent, Glide score = \u22127.09 kcal mol\u22121) could be of interest for in vitro testing. Details of intermolecular interactions of these drugs with the interface of Spike\u2013ACE2 are shown in Fig. 5\n. In summary, these drugs form \u03c0-cation interactions with Lys31a, \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions with Phe170b and H-bonds with His34a, Asp38a, Gly176b and Ser174b. In good agreement with our results, a previous study suggests that an early and high dose of a statin (such as pravastatin) could be crucial to surviving MERS-CoV infection [77]. These suggested molecules could be validated in future in vitro experiments.",

Therefore, we have also taken a drug repurposing approach based on polypharmacology using a method called the \u2018molecular and biological signature\u2019 [78]. This is a profiling approach, guided by artificial intelligence, capable of presenting the complex relationships between the chemical substance with molecular targets, cells and/or organs. This could create a more complete understanding of the \u2018multi-biological profile\u2019 caused by the drug analyzed in response to a disease. As an example, we have applied the drugs ritonavir [9], favipiravir, ribavirin and chloroquine as scaffolds to find new potential molecular and biological signature profiles, to search for non-obvious, mechanism-of-action-based associations between drugs, molecular targets and diseases (Fig. 6\n; and Supplementary material Fig. S6 and Table S3 online). Comparing the molecular and biological signature of ritonavir with other drugs, we found that the drugs cobicistat, carfilzomib and ombitasvir presented the highest matching scores (81\u201371%), suggesting that those drugs could be of further interest for SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "Although there are already several drugs being assessed clinically for SARS-CoV-2, there is still a need to identify additional treatments as alternatives (to offset drug shortages) and possibly discover molecules with increased efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness. We have previously proposed and applied computational drug discovery approaches such as machine learning and docking to aid in the discovery of new candidate molecules for Ebola and Zika, respectively. What we have learnt in these efforts can be applied to SARS-CoV-2 as we have demonstrated here. However, the research in this case has moved at a much faster pace initially, delivering a first crystal structure in just a few weeks after first public notification of the virus. Companies have mobilized to bring their drugs to patients and clinicians have used prior in vitro research that proposed compounds active against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV to suggest treatments for SARS-CoV-2. We currently do not clinically use any broad-spectrum antivirals in the USA but they would be invaluable in situations like this for SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses. Identifying medications with side-effect profiles known by clinicians that are already produced at scale and available at local pharmacies around the world will allow more patients to be treated, especially as travel restrictions and quarantines could reduce production and distribution of certain drugs. It will remain important that those who need these medications at baseline, such as HIV patients who take ritonavir/lopinavir, are able to continue to access the medications they need or else there is a risk of poor clinical outcomes and antiviral resistance in these patients. Although other viruses such as the flu might have killed more patients in the USA this season so far, the crippling financial impact of SARS-CoV-2 remains to be seen globally. If past Ebola, ZIKV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV outbreaks are anything to go by this SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will be far more significant. Having multiple effective treatments available for SARS-CoV-2 that can be rapidly delivered to patients could save lives. We can also supplement these treatments by a combination of computational screening with machine learning and docking to select additional drugs to test as proposed herein and this can be repeated for future virus outbreaks. The sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu will probably be repeated again and again with the next virus outbreaks until we develop broader-spectrum antivirals. Each time we hope to be better prepared. Hope however does not save lives. Effective antiviral treatments do, and we need to have them ready in the future.",
