The spectrum of activity of PCV against human herpesviruses was found to be similar to that of ACV, however in certain circumstances PCV was more active than ACV owing to the higher stability of PCV-TP in infected cells relative to ACV-TP.14 Also, at concentrations up to 100 \u00b5g/mL, it was confirmed that PCV, like ACV, was highly selective and subsequently did not exhibit any toxicity in cell culture.14 Similarly, HBG is reported to have higher affinity for HSV-1 TK than ACV in addition to relatively comparable selectivity for inhibition of viral DNA synthesis and good safety profile in cell culture.15\n",

Compounds 9h and 9i showed anti-HSV-1 activity only at a relatively high concentration (EC50 = 76.5 and 44.7 \u00b5M, respectively), compounds 9b and 9e showed moderate anti-HSV-1 activity (EC50 = 8.9 and 20.00 \u00b5M/mL, respectively), whereas 9g and 9f were the most active and were inhibitory to HSV-1 replication with EC50 = 1.5 and 7.6 \u00b5M, respectively. Similar to anti-HSV-1 results, among the synthesised tricyclic PCV compounds, compounds 9g and 9f were the most active against the HSV-2 strain and showed marked inhibition (EC50 = 0.8 and 2.3 \u00b5M, respectively). Also, compounds 9b, 9e and 9i showed moderate activity against HSV-2 strain (EC50 = 28\u201340.9 \u00b5M), whereas the remaining compounds did not show any activity against the HSV-2 strain. Two compounds, 9b and 9g, retained activity against the TK\u2212 ACV resistant strain of HSV-1. Compound 9g showed potent inhibitory activity against HSV-1 TK\u2212 (EC50 = 0.8 \u00b5M), whereas compound 9b was moderately active against HSV-1 TK\u2212 (EC50 = 12 \u00b5M). The data suggest that in the case of the resistant strain TK\u2212, compounds 9f and 9g are independent of viral TK catalysed phosphorylation for antiviral activity and/or may use a different metabolic activation pathway and/or display a unique mechanism of antiviral action by the un-metabolised nucleoside analogue.",

Confluent cell cultures (or nearly confluent for MDCK cells) in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID50of virus (1 CCID50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 plaque- forming units (PFU). After 1\u20132 h virus adsorption period, residual virus was removed, and the cell cultures were incubated in the presence of varying concentrations (200, 40, 8, 1.6, 0.32 \u03bcM) of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC50 (50% effective concentration) or compound concentration required to reduce virus-induced cytopathogenicity or viral plaque formation by 50%. The MCC (minimal cytotoxic concentration) values were determined as the compound concentration required to afford a microscopically visible alteration of cell morphology. The new compounds were screened for their potential cytostatic activity against eight human cancer cell lines. The 50% cytostatic inhibitory concentration (IC50) causing a 50% decrease in cell proliferationrelative to the number of cells in the untreated controls was determined against retina (non cancerous) hTERT RPE-1, pancreatic adenocarcinomaCapan-1, chronic myeloid leukaemia Hap1, lung carcinoma NCI-H460, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia DND-41, acute myeloid leukaemia HL-60, chronic myeloid leukaemia K-562 and non-Hodgkin lymphoma Z-138.",

The Alpha Triangle placement, which derives poses by random superposition of ligand atom triplets through alpha sphere dummies in the receptor site, was chosen to determine the poses. The London \u0394G scoring function estimates the free energy of binding of the ligand from a given pose. Refinement of the results was done using the MMFF94 forcefield, and rescoring of the refined results using the London \u0394G scoring function was applied. The output database dock file was created with different poses for each ligand and arranged according to the final score function (S), which is the score of the last stage that was not set to zero.",
