In children, intravenous magnesium is typically reserved as rescue treatment for severely ill patients. Nebulized magnesium therapy seems ineffective in adults with severe asthma.6 In a recent placebo\u2010controlled multicenter trial7 of nebulized magnesium therapy in children with severe asthma, the investigators considered a reduced asthma severity score one hour after magnesium treatment statistically significant but clinically insignificant, with no difference in time to discharge or rate of hospital admission. There continues to be speculation about asthmatic patients that nebulized magnesium might benefit.2, 5, 7\n",

We escalate to infirmary (i.e., short\u2010stay unit) admission for children failing to improve substantially with inhaled bronchodilator and oral steroid therapy (17% of PEC asthma visits in 2013) and transfer patients failing in the infirmary to the pediatric ICU (0.06% of PEC asthma visits in 2013), where they often require intubation. Nebulizing magnesium sulfate is inexpensive and were it proven therapeutic, could be readily generalizable to rich and poor communities alike worldwide for preventing a potential downhill clinical course during worrisome pediatric asthma patient presentations. Since moderate and severe asthma patients already have a prolonged length of stay, we tested nebulized magnesium added when therapy was initiated, rather than randomized as rescue therapy some time after bronchodilator and steroid therapy had been deemed to have failed. We sought to enroll children presenting with moderate or severe asthma in a blinded, placebo\u2010controlled trial that would ensure standard therapy to all, optimize aerosol technology,8 confirm systemic magnesium sulfate delivery, and test for a significant difference in time to medical readiness for discharge.",

There was no blocking or stratification. Other than the study pharmacists, who had no patient interaction and were unaware of treatment assignment to patients, all study personnel were blinded to treatment. After obtaining verbal and written informed consent from accompanying parents, patients admitted to infirmary care had baseline asthma score recorded by trained staff, a chest radiograph, an intravenous line inserted, methylprednisone 1 mg/kg iv every 12 hr begun, and 3 doses begun of nebulized 1 ml albuterol (5 mg/ml) with 250 mcg ipratropium bromide and 2 ml normal saline. The three combination bronchodilator doses were administered over 1 hr. Magnesium sulfate or placebo was not added to this first hour nebulization due to osmolarity considerations and volume limitations of the Idehaler. Therefore, this was followed in the next hour by nebulization of three 5\u2010mL doses of study medication (active or placebo), to which 1 ml of albuterol (5 mg/ml) had been added (6 ml/nebulization, 433 mOsm/L, three nebulizations during the second hour). Afterward, each patient received albuterol nebulizations hourly for 3 hr, then q 2 hr until ready for discharge from infirmary care. Additional albuterol nebulizations, three back\u2010to\u2010back, could be administered by decision of the treating physician. Nebulized medication was given by tight face mask with pressurized O2 at 10 L/min, except for study medication which was given by Aeroneb Pro with an Idehaler holding chamber. All study patients had a nasal swab for viral and mycoplasma PCR studies. Oxygen was given by face mask if needed to keep the O2 saturation \u226594%. Vital signs were recorded at baseline, 2, and 4 hr and every 4 hr thereafter. Asthma severity score was recorded at baseline, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hr unless the patient was discharged from the infirmary earlier. The time when a patient was medically ready for discharge, which required feeding well, comfortable breathing, an O2 saturation \u226594% on room air, and an asthma severity score \u22643, was recorded. At discharge, all patients were given prednisolone pills or syrup to complete 5 d of steroid treatment. Telephone call follow\u2010up by a study nurse was done for each study patient. Revisits to PEC and need for repeat infirmary care or hospitalization were recorded.",

Two recent randomized studies seeking to study solely severe asthmatics, children7 and adults,6 found their effort frustrated and included moderate asthmatics, as we set out to do. Many severe asthmatics have already received steroid therapy as outpatients and greatest severity often becomes apparent during treatment rather than clearly perceived at presentation. We reasoned that the therapeutic population for an optimized clinical trial of nebulized magnesium sulfate should include children presenting with moderate asthma as well.

After randomization, all our patients were administered systemic steroid as well as 3 combined bronchodilator treatments (intensive therapy consistent with existing guidelines)3 prior to nebulized investigational therapy, possibly diluting the proportion of patients remaining with moderate or severe asthma. An alternative design, studying nebulized magnesium solely as a rescue therapy after failure of bronchodilator and steroid therapy was unappealing because there is no uniform generalized definition of failure but it certainly would consume considerable time after presentation to have \u201cfailed\u201d, and our goal was to test for efficacy, safety, and proof of delivery a therapy that could be added early to moderate and severe asthmatics. Counterbalancing this possible concern is the clinical course of our study patients, whose mean infirmary stay duration before medical readiness for discharge was nonetheless prolonged, about 15 hr despite receipt of systemic steroid therapy, a treatment for moderate to severe asthma. It is also possible a substantially higher nebulized magnesium sulfate dose than we gave, or more than three doses of it, may have provided demonstrable benefit. Although the treated group had persistently elevated magnesium levels 3 hr after initiation of magnesium nebulization, we did not obtain pharmacokinetic measurements to allow a comparison with intravenous magnesium dosing. However, our nebulized dose of 800 mg was 77% higher than the 453 mg nebulized in a recent trial in children7; it was 53% of the 1500 mg tested in adults.6 Moreover, all but one of our patients was able to be discharged from infirmary care without ICU admission.",
