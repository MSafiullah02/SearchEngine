            "text": "The covid-19 pandemic currently confronts nearly all of the world's countries. A growing number of governments are enforcing or recommending home quarantines to contain the spread of the virus. As the virus can be transmitted outside and within households, the effects of such measures will depend on the number of transmissions that take place outside and within the household. Evidence shows that the risk of severe disease and mortality increases sharply with age (1, 2) . Therefore, the age structure of the population-what proportion are young or old-and the structure of co-residency-how big are households and how old are their members-are two key factors that determine the vulnerability of countries to outbreaks of covid-19, and how effective general and age-specific household confinement policies can be in reducing mortality after an outbreak (3) . Figure 1 provides estimates of the number of deaths from covid-19 per 100,000 individuals if countries were to experience an outbreak of covid-19 of equal size, more specifically, a random infection of 10% of the population living in private households. Results are shown for 81 countries, covering all regions of the world and are solely based on census-based micro-data on age and co-residence patterns combined with age-specific infect fatality ratios (2) . The left-hand segment of each bar provides an estimate of direct mortality of individuals who catch the disease in a 10% random infection of the population (primary infections). The right-hand segment of the bars shows the additional deaths that would occur if all other members of the household become infected too (secondary infections). Lower rates of household transmission would reduce this number of indirect deaths proportionally. The direct effect depends on the age structure of the population; the indirect effect hinges on the size and age structure of households. Combined, they show how, all else equal, national age and co-residence patterns alter the vulnerability of a country to covid-19 outbreaks. The expected direct death rates per 100,000 individuals range from 20 in South Sudan to 136 in Italy. Together with Italy, three Southern European countries-Greece, Portugal and Spain-rank among the top five, followed by the rest of Europe and North America. Latin American countries form a homogenous cluster lower than the European and North American cluster. Asian countries spread all over the range with estimates as high as 96 in South Korea and as low as 25 in Jordan. African countries tend to experience the lowest direct death rates. Where the elderly comprise a large portion of the population, the direct effect is high, whereas direct deaths are much lower where the elderly are vastly outnumbered by younger people.",

The ratio between indirect and direct effects is a simple indicator of the importance of co-residence patterns, in particular of the elderly, the most vulnerable group. For European and North American countries, direct and indirect deaths are roughly equal. In Latin America, indirect deaths could approximately double the number of direct deaths. The ratio between potential indirect and direct deaths in Asia ranges from 1.3 (South Korea) to 3.2 (Bangladesh). In Africa, indirect deaths would be three to four times the number of direct deaths. Such variation is closely associated with cross-national variation in co-residence patterns and, more specifically, with the number and age of the persons with whom elderly people reside.",

Countries with similar indirect death rates, such as Italy and China, have quite distinct direct death rates, due to differences in their age structure.",

            "text": "Debates exist about the role that specific age-groups, and particularly children, play in the transmission of the virus (8) . In addition, countries have adopted age-specific policies such as school closures and extended confinement of the elderly in their homes. This provokes the question to what extent preventing primary infection of certain age groups would reduce the number of deaths that can arise due to within-household transmission of the virus. The bars in Figure 2 provide information about the expected mortality from direct and indirect deaths if primary infections for specific age groups could be averted. Results are shown for 10 countries chosen to illustrate diverse interactions between age structures and co-residence patterns (see Figure S3 for all countries). The first column shows the total number of deaths per 100,000 population if no age group is excluded from primary infection. The other columns indicate the total number of direct and indirect deaths per 100,000 population if primary infections could be averted for a particular age group. Deaths due to primary infection are reduced most in all countries if infections of individuals aged 65 or more are prevented. There is much more variation in how much avoiding primary infections of specific age-groups affects the number of indirect deaths that arise due to secondary infection (within household transmission). In France, indirect deaths are simulated to go down considerably if no person aged 65 or older were to be infected directly. This indicates that elderly persons primarily live with other persons aged 65 or older in France ( Figure S4 , Figure S5 ). These coresidence patterns also imply that avoiding primary infections for other age groups have relatively little effect on deaths that emerge due to within household transmission of the virus in France. At the other extreme, there are countries such as Bangladesh where preventing direct infections of the elderly would barely reduce indirect deaths and where avoiding the primary infection of children or adults aged 19-49 has a larger impact on indirect deaths. This result is explained by the high levels of intergenerational co-residence of the elderly together with the fact that children comprise a large share of the total population in these countries ( Figure S4 , Figure S5 ). Other countries fall between these two extremes with the United States being similar to France, and Ghana and South Africa resembling Bangladesh. Some cases combine elements from both extremes, such as Italy where both confining the elderly and individuals aged 19-49 reduce indirect deaths. However, in none of the scenarios do indirect deaths go down considerably. This illustrates the double challenge that countries such as Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain face: the combination of an aged population with inter-generational residence leads to high estimated death rates due to covid-19 but also makes preventing deaths due to within-household transmission of the virus particularly challenging.",

Differences in age structures put countries at different risk; a less considered factor, coresidence patterns, modulates this risk. In our simulations, which can be considered baseline scenarios before accounting for specific national policies, the proportion dying per 100,000 population is 275 in Italy and 80 in Mozambique ( Figure 1 ). In contrast, if 10% of the population is infected at random and their household members become infected too, the proportion of the population that becomes infected is 28% in Italy and 44% in Mozambique ( Figure S2 ). Because of different age and co-residence patterns, Italy is confronted with more deaths per capita than Mozambique but fewer infections. The effectiveness of policies in one country compared with another country should be evaluated in light of different baseline vulnerabilities.",

Therefore, avoiding primary infections of the elderly will be less effective in reducing deaths because the elderly might still get infected by younger household members.

Figure S4 shows the household structure of the persons who were simulated to die after primary infection (direct deaths). It becomes clear that many of the persons who die due to primary infection are persons aged 65+ who live alone or with another person (probably their partner) in European and North American countries. In Africa and Asia, the majority of direct deaths occur within households where persons above 65+ live with three other persons or more. Figure S5 further completes this picture by showing the household structure of persons who are estimated to die due to secondary infection. These numbers underline that in Europe and North America many indirect deaths occur in households where persons aged 65+ live with one other person (most likely their partner). In France and Switzerland this is the most common household type among those simulated to die due to secondary infection. Not only does this appear to reduce the number of estimated indirect deaths, it might also make confining the elderly in their households a more effective strategy to further reduce indirect deaths. In contrast, in Asia and Africa the majority of indirect deaths occur in households where a person over 65 lives in a household with four or more members. As indirect deaths comprise the lion's share of estimated deaths in these countries, reducing mortality in Africa and Asia will depend on how effectively secondary infections within large households can be prevented.",

In the 2009 Multiscopo data, 55.9% of those 75+ are aged 80 or more. The website of the Italian Statistical Office ISTAT (http://dati.istat.it/#) provides data from 2012 onward, which indicated a similar percentage of 59.4% of those 75 or older being 80+ for 2012.
