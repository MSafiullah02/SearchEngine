Evolution on computed tomography scans of pulmonary infiltrates (A) at admission and (B) after 5 days of empirical antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam. (7, 8) . Second, a positive NAAT made on a tissue specimen or a BAL sample may either reflect active disease or shedding (1) . Third, high VLs are sometimes observed in asymptomatic transplant patients, which underline the imperfect degree of correlation between VLs and occurrence of invasive disease (9) (10) (11) .",
