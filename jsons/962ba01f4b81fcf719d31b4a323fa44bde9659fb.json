Standard SEIR models distinguish essentially two regimes: either the disease is controlled and the number of infected people rapidly decreases, or the disease spreads and contaminates a significant fraction of the population until herd immunity is achieved. After lockdown, at first sight it seems that social distancing is not enough to control the outbreak. We discuss here a possible explanation, namely that the lockdown is creating social heterogeneity: even if a large majority of the population complies with the lockdown rules, a small fraction of the population still has to maintain a normal or high level of social interactions, such as health workers, providers of essential services, etc. This results in an apparent high level of epidemic propagation as measured through re-estimations of the basic reproduction ratio. However, these measures are limited to averages, while variance inside the population plays an essential role on the peak and the size of the epidemic outbreak and tends to lower these two indicators. We provide theoretical and numerical results to sustain such a view.",

Les mod\u00e8les SEIR standards distinguent deux r\u00e9gimes: soit la maladie est contr\u00f4l\u00e9e et le nombre de personnes infect\u00e9es diminue rapidement, soit la maladie se propage et contamine une fraction importante de la population jusqu'\u00e0 ce que l'immunit\u00e9 collective soit atteinte.

The advantage of such models is that the impact of the variation of a single parameter on various qualitative properties can easily be studied, but the risk lies in an outrageous simplification of the representation of a complex system, with the additional difficulty that some parameters can be difficult to quantify from the available statistical data. Here we numerically study how the separation of the population into two sub-groups of individuals with different intensities of social interaction can qualitatively explain some observed features of the current pandemic of Covid-19 and provide some theoretical explanations which also apply to more realistic models.",

One of the issues is that curves showing the number of new cases in European countries stabilize very slowly after lockdown. Many questions have been raised on the methods for collecting the data and on their quality, that we do not address, not to mention variations between countries that deserve further investigations. As a simple explanation, is has been suggested that the main reason is that a significant fraction of the population does not respect lockdown. This ignores the nonlinear properties of simple epidemic models. We show here that, if a rather small fraction of the population cannot reduce its social interactions, eventually for very good reasons as, e.g., the health workers or some other key actors of our societies, the epidemic keeps spreading, stabilizes at a much slower rate than what one would expect, and finally affects a significant fraction of the population.",

The SEIR model has various properties that can be understood, at least for the order of magnitude of its effects, using simple objects like the well known basic reproduction ratio R 0 . However, it also has very nonlinear features which are defying common sense and require rigorous mathematical analysis. In the accompanying numerical examples, we take values for the parameters which are compatible with the data collected during the pandemic of Covid- 19 . These examples are intended to understand qualitative features of the epidemic but cannot and should not be implemented for direct predictive use, as our model is too crude and oversimplified to reflect the Covid-19 epidemic in a quantitative manner.",

A model with a large majority of the population under lockdown and a small minority which does not or cannot implement the social distancing is then considered. The factor of reduction of social interactions q quantifies the effect of the lockdown. It is certainly very difficult to measure this parameter in real life applications and structured population models should be considered, in order to reflect the variety of social interactions. Our goal is to understand how, by varying q, one eventually triggers the nonlinearity of the SEIR model and, as a consequence, how this drives the system into a stable equilibrium which is far from the usual target of a lockdown policy, that is, the control of the disease, but is also far from the dynamics that would develop in absence of lockdown.",

The average incubation period is 1/\u03b1, the parameter \u03b2 is the product of the average number of contacts per person and per unit time by the probability of disease transmission in a contact between a susceptible and an infectious individual, \u03b3 is a transition rate so that 1/\u03b3 measures the duration of the infection of an individual and N is the total population size. In the Covid-19 pandemy, the average incubation period is of several days and this is why an SEIR model has to be preferred to a simple SIR model. Many qualitative features are the same in the two models but the compartment E of exposed individuals makes the analysis slightly more delicate. Unreported cases or asymptomatic individuals are not taken into account: this is an important aspect of the Covid-19 epidemic, see for instance [7, 25, 26] , with important consequences on the epidemic size, but probably not so much on the qualitative issues that are discussed in this paper. Other factors, like delays for the transmission of the information studied in [5] , certainly also play a role in the current outbreak. The SEIR model is a compartmental model used to understand the mathematical modelling of infectious diseases in a large population, with enough individuals in each compartment so that stochastic effects can be neglected. Spatial effects are also neglected, which is a rather crude approximation. However, such a simplified model allows us to perform an analysis of the sensibility to the parameters which are of interest for a qualitative description of the outbreak of an epidemic disease.",

The solution of (6)-(9) converges as t \u2192 +\u221e to (s , 0, 0, r = 1 \u2212 s ), the stationary solution (s , 0, 0, r ) is stable and this is why we call it the stable equilibrium solution. See [27, Section 7.3] for a discussion of the stability. In a model with birth and death rates, the solution is usually called the endemic equilibrium, but we shall prefer to call it simply the stable equilibrium solution as we neglect birth and death issues. The following discussion is given here in preparation for the next two sections. We do not claim originality and refer for instance to [14] for a detailed study motivated by very explicit examples. Depending whether the DFE solution is stable or not, we have three regimes for s = s (\u03b5):",

While the group corresponding to k = 1 observes a lockdown and has a factor q k > 1, we are interested in the situation in which the other group has no reduction of social interactions: q 2 = 1, or eventually has more social interactions than average before lockdown, corresponding to some q 2 < 1. The typical example is the case of health workers in a period of epidemic disease or supermarket cashiers, who have contacts with a much larger number of people than an average individual. It is of course very difficult to estimate q 2 and one should take into account the efficiency of barrier procedures. Instead of trying to make rough guesses for the value of q 2 , we will vary it in order to see what is the impact on the solutions.",

Modeling heterogeneous mixing in infectious disease dynamics when the population is subdivided by characteristics other than those that are disease-related, such as risk status or age, is not new. This has been considered for instance from the dynamical point of view in [19] or in the case of sexually transmitted diseases and particularly in HIV/AIDS models, with groups that are not all defined by disease related properties. In this perspective, contact matrices have been considered, which involves a detailed analysis of the transmission mechanisms. We can refer to [1, [15] [16] [17] 28] for various considerations in this direction and to [13, Section 3] for a discussion of the homogeneous mixing fallacy in the application to successful vaccination policies. The present paper ignores a number of issues like symmetry in transmission between groups and density-dependent transmission questions in order to focus on simple qualitative questions: any serious study with quantitative goals should of course address these issues with care: see for instance [4] for a warning. For sake of simplicity, we have chosen to consider that the origin of the infected individuals (group 1 or 2) plays no role in the transmission. This has the simple consequence that the basic reproduction ratio R is in the end exactly the average of the ratios independently computed for each group, as shown by (38). In the regime corresponding to p much smaller than 1 \u2212 p and whatever the details are, our model is anyway good enough to show that what matters is the average of the ratios 1 . However, when one considers large time asymptotics, the message is not only the average and this is what we explain next.",

Several phases for a population under lockdown are illustrated in [22] by the computation of the effective reproduction ratio R t (which is of the order of R 0 as only a small proportion of the total population was concerned) in Wuhan, based on the reported daily Covid-19 infections: when there was no intervention (before January 23, 2020): R t \u2248 3.88; under lockdown with traffic ban and many confined at home (between January 23-February 1st, 2020): R t \u2248 1.25; using centralized confinement (after February 1st, 2020): R t \u2248 0.32. Also see [24] for a detailed analysis of the data in Wuhan based on a SIR type model. Although this is not really good news, the curves in Europe so far ressemble more to what happened in Wuhan by the end of january, with an R 0 > 1, than to what happened later, and this is what we intend to explain in France, although the country is now under lockdown for more than a month.",

The basic reproduction ratio in the second system is R (1) 0 (q) = R 0 /q, which allows us to reduce both problems to (6)- (9) with various values of the basic reproduction ratio depending on the q factor. Here we choose the initial data according to (61) and the set of parameters (62). See Fig. 1 for the epidemic curves, and Fig. 2 for the epidemic size. The other curves represent r(t) taken for t = 30, 60, 90, for which equilibrium is not yet achieved. In practice, varying R 0 is achieved by acting on the q factor in (25)-(28).",

However, we have seen that there is another possible model, as it is illustrated by Fig. 3 , with two groups. From the figure, it is clearly impossible to distinguish between the two scenarios at the early stage of the outbreak. With two groups arises the question of choosing the initial data. As a crude and simplifying assumption, we make the choice to consider that before lockdown there was a single population and that the two categories of the population had the same exposure to the disease. We can then use (61) as initial condition and take s 1 (0) = (1 \u2212 p) s(0) and s 2 (0) = p s(0). With this choice, we recover the results of (25)-(28) if q 1 = q 2 and s = s 1 + s 2 . In order to fix ideas, we also make the arbitrary choice of choosing q 1 = 2.35 so that the epidemic disease would extinguish by itself after affecting 0.81% of the population if q 2 = q 1 . We can illustrate the role of the two parameters p and q 2 by showing that they completely change the picture and bring us back to a regime with an epidemic size corresponding to some inefficient lockdown, however with lower epidemic peak and size: see .

Note that the figure on the left is the same as in Fig. 1 (right) , on a different scale. The straight dotted line is the level p. In the case with two groups, note that almost all individuals of the second group get infected during the propagation of the disease.

The other lines correspond to simulations of r(t) for t = 30, 60, 90 in the model with two groups. With two groups, we recover a phase transition as in Fig. 2 , corresponding to q 2 \u2248 0.96.",

With R 0 /q > 1, but close to 1, the epidemic disease spreads, the final state depends little on the initial data, but the curve is flattenned: qualitatively, this is the scenario that one can observe in the Covid-19 outbreak in France under lockdown.",

The aim of this article is to show that the crucial information cannot be reduced to the knowledge of an average factor q: if the population is divided into two groups, with a group for which q > R 0 (the majority) and another group (the minority) that keeps a small q factor, the disease may continue to spread. If the q factor of the majority is larger than R 0 but close to R 0 , so that 1 \u2212 R 0 /q > 0 is small, the impact of the minority becomes extremely important as it eventually triggers the nonlinearity. However, the equilibrium asymptotic state in a two-group model is not the same as when considering a single group with an averaged basic reproduction ratio. The dynamics of the outbreak, for instance the height of the epidemic peak, is also changed. A two-group model is of course extremely simplistic, but shows the importance of understanding the distribution of the q factors in a population.",

In our model of heterogeneous social interactions, with a whole distribution of q factors, we have shown that an average of q is not relevant. While the basic reproduction ratio behaves as a plain average across the homogeneous q categories, neither the peak nor the total epidemic size do the same. In particular the presence of heterogeneity is beneficial for both the peak and total epidemic size. Or, put it otherwise, a model with only one group and fitting the observed data in the initial phase of the outbreak will be more pessimistic concerning the epidemic outcomes than a heterogeneous model; this is even more true after lockdown when social distancing measures have been enforced, the lockdown being by its nature a creator of heterogeneity. In terms of public health, this also underlines the importance of targeting prevention measures on individuals with a high level of social interactions.",
