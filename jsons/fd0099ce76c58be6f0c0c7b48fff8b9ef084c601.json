The pattern results from how species interact and evolve by mechanisms and processes including symbiosis; symbiogenesis; lateral gene transfer (that occurs via bacterial conjugation, transformation, transduction, Gene Transfer Agents, or the movements of transposons, retrotransposons, and other mobile genetic elements); hybridization or divergence with gene flow; and infectious heredity (induced either directly by bacteria, bacteriophages, viruses, prions, protozoa and fungi, or via vectors that transmit these pathogens). Research on reticulate evolution today takes on inter-and transdisciplinary proportions and is able to unite distinct research fields ranging from microbiology and molecular genetics to evolutionary biology and the biomedical sciences. This chapter summarizes the main principles of the diverse reticulate evolutionary mechanisms and situates them into the chapters that make up this volume.",

When organisms engage in a symbiotic association, both the host (the larger partner in the association) and the symbiont(s) (the smaller partner) often develop new features and sometimes form new individuals with characteristics not found in the individual organisms (Margulis 1991 (Margulis , 1998 .

When distinct organisms live on the surface of other organisms (on their skin, the leafs or roots of plants, the gill of fish, the outer membrane of cells), the symbiosis is called ectosymbiosis; and when organisms live inside other living organisms (inside the cells, leaf cavities or roots of legumes, or inside the vascular, lymphatic or gastro-intestinal systems), it is called endosymbiosis.

The origin of photosynthetic life forms (organisms that produce oxygen as a waste product), led to the great oxygenation event which commenced somewhat 2.4 billion years ago. The transition from a reducing atmosphere to an oxygen-rich atmosphere led to the oxygen catastrophe, i.e., the first major extinction event where obligate anaerobe life forms that evolved in the Hadean and Archean became severely threatened. The great oxygenation event was a precondition for oxygen-respiring life forms to evolve, and it triggered the Huronian glaciation (the first ice age). These environmental changes were also one of the triggers for the evolution of symbiogenesis out of permanent symbiosis, where, as an adaptive environmental response, various life forms increased in size and sought permanent shelter in one another to find protection against the devastating environmental conditions.",

The permanent endosymbiosis resulted in symbiogenesis: the cyanobacteria evolved into organelles, cellular structures that permanently reside inside the cells. With the Russians, hereditary symbiosis became understood as a causal agent in the evolution of new morphological features, and symbiogenesis was identified as an evolutionary mechanism whereby species evolve. A symbiogenetic origin for mitochondria, which are also eukaryotic organelles, was conjectured by Paul Portier in France (who identified them as \"cellular symbiotes\"), and in America by Ivan Wallin who adopted the notion of hereditary symbiosis and introduced the concept of \"symbionticism\" (Sapp 2003) .",

SET-theory, \u2026 presents a theory of the origin of \u2026 discontinuity between eukaryotic (mitosing or 'higher') and prokaryotic cells. Specifically, the mitochondria, \u2026 and the photosynthetic plastids can all be considered to have derived from free-living cells, and the eukaryotic cell is the result of the evolution of ancient symbioses. Although these ideas are not new [Merechowsky (1910) and Minchin (1915) in Wilson (1925) , Wallin (1927) , Lederberg (1952 ), Haldane (1954 , Ris and Plaut (1962) ], in this paper they have been synthesized in such a way as to be consistent with recent data on the biochemistry and cytology of subcellular organelles. (Sagan 1967: 226) Contrary to Woese (Woese et al. 1978 (Woese et al. , 1990 Woese and Fox 1977) Woese and Fox 1977) who divides life into three domains, namely Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukaryota, Margulis endorsed a 5-kingdom classification of life and understood symbiogenesis as the distinguishing feature that separates prokaryotic organisms such as Archaebacteria and Eubacteria belonging to the Monera kingdom from all eukaryotic organisms, i.e., the Protoctists or protists (for the difference see Rothschild 1989), Fungi, Animal and Plant Kingdoms (Whitaker and Margulis 1978) . For Margulis (1998: 42): symbiogenesis is the factor that distinguishes all nucleated-cell life from all bacterial life. No middle ground exists -either a group of organisms evolved by symbiogenesis or it did not. My claim is that all nucleated organisms (protoctists, plants, fungi, and animals) arose by symbiogenesis \u2026 SET provides a theory for the origin of the four eukaryotic kingdoms which have evolved by three symbiogenetic mergings (Fig. 1 ).",

Mitosis involves a series of complex movements of compartmentalized genes, and for Fig. 1 Schematic of the three symbiogenetic mergings that underlie the evolution of the four eukaryotic kingdoms. In a first merger, Thermoplasma-like archaebacteria and Spirochete-like eubacteria merged and evolved into the first eukaryotic cells. In a second merger, anaerobe eukaryotic protoctists engulfed aerobe proteobacteria and evolved into the mitochondria that are found in aerobe protoctist, fungi, plant and animal cells. In a third merger, the products of the second merger engulfed cyanobacteria that evolved into the chloroplasts found in plant cells Margulis (1998: 40-43) , spirochetes are what enabled this internal movement or \"dance of the chromosomes.\" The first merger also enabled external movement, because it gave rise to undulipodia (\"waving feet\"), including cilia, the \"tails\" and \"hairs\" of eukaryotic cells. For that reason, the first merger is also called \"motility symbiosis.\" Evidence for motility symbiosis is found in the structure of centrioli, undulipodia and cilia. Centrioli make up the centrosome, i.e., the microtubules-organizing center important for mitosis. Centrosomes also lie at the formation of kinetosomes, the basal bodies wherefrom moving organelles (undulipodia and cilia) extend. Undulipodia and cilia are made up of microtubular structures that in their shaft (the axoneme) have microtubules arranged according to a [9(2) + 2] pattern and in their basal bodies (kinetosomes) they all have microtubules arranged according to a [9(3) + 0] pattern. This latter pattern is identical to the microtubular organization found in centrioli (Fig. 2) , and the centrioli are responsible for the formation of the kinetosome as well as the mitotic spindle. Based upon their morphological similarity, in SET theory, centrioli, undulipodia, and cilia are conjectured to have evolved from once-free-living spirochetes because free-living spirochetes often contain cytoplasmic tubules that resemble microtubules (Margulis and Dolan 2001: 89-96) .",

In both cases, these once-free-living bacteria were engulfed by the first eukaryotic life forms, the endosymbiosis with the intracellular guests became permanent and hereditary, and this hereditary symbiosis led to the evolution of the respective organelles.

Nonetheless, these plastids have been acquired repeatedly, often as primary, secondary, and tertiary endosymbiosis events. Eukaryotic organisms with chloroplasts in place and forming a primary endosymbiosis were completely engulfed by other eukaryotes where the engulfed organism, as a whole, started to function as a chloroplast. Products of this secondary endosymbiosis in turn have also been engulfed by other eukaryotes, a process called tertiary endosymbiosis (Archibald 2011 (Archibald , 2014 . Symbiogenesis as an evolutionary mechanism therefore not merely evidences a pattern of reticulation, it also demonstrates a pattern of increased embedding, comparable to Russian dolls, though the dolls have different morphologies rather than being identical.

At the time, scholars falsely divided the human species into separate races. Colonization led to many mixed marriages and \"bastard children,\" leading naturalists and clergyman of the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth century to speculate on the long-term consequences of mixing. John Ray, for example, in a paper presented at the Royal Society of London in 1684, argued that hybridization violates the divine order in the world for God had created the species in a fixed form, and he speculated that hybridization would have devastating influences on the \"pure breeds\" (Kingsbury 2009 ).

K\u00f6lreuter mixed various species of tobacco plants in the 1760s, but many of those turned out sterile, making K\u00f6lreuter agree with Ray and conclude that hybridization was against divine creation and that it would eventually lead to sterility in the offspring of all crosses.",

Babcock and Stebbins (1938) discovered that many Crepis species regularly hybridize, that hybridization leads to polyploidy (chromosome doubling), and they pointed out that hybridization maximizes both variation and the potential to occupy diverse ecological niches. For Stebbins (1940) , polyploidy in particular was important to understand the evolution of new plant genera. With Top right Speciation by hybridization: Members of species A and B cross and form a new species C, while species A and B either seize to exist due to the crossings or continue to evolve independently. Bottom left Speciation by symbiosis, symbiogenesis, lateral gene transfer, or hybridization: species A and B maintain symbiotic relations, acquire symbionts, or exchange genes horizontally, or they regularly hybridize, while they remain distinct species. Species A \u2032 and B \u2032 are nonetheless genetically, morphologically, or behaviorally altered by the various crossings, transfers and symbiotic associations in time, possibly up to the point that they evolved into new species (species C and D). Bottom right Divergence by gene flow or introgression: During its divergence from species A, species B either regularly backcrosses with its parental species (introgression), or exchanges genes laterally (directly or via symbiosis), thereby causing both species to diverge in time. This leads to the evolution of a new species B, and also the parental species is genetically altered (species A \u2032 ), possibly up to the point that it evolved into a new species (species C) Stebbins, Crespis species soon became what Drosophila provides for geneticists, Escherichia coli for bacteriologists, and Wolbachia for scholars studying lateral gene transfer and symbiosis: a model organism.",

With the 1959 book, he launched the new field of evolutionary plant biology and he dedicated full chapters to hybridization and polyploidy which he understood to be targets of natural selection. Anderson (1949) , who coined the term introgression, pointed out the creative role hybridization can play because hybrids may backcross with their parental species, thereby increasing genetic diversity, adaptation, and fitness of both populations. Anderson was also a member of the Society for Evolution that gave way to the foundation of the Modern Synthesis (Gontier forthcoming; Smocovitis 1997) . Together with Stebbins, he emphasized that hybridization plays a significant role in evolution because hybridization introduces new variation and enables a wider occupancy of ecological space (Anderson and Stebbins 1954) .",

Many viruses can also copy their genetic material into the genome of the host. Endogenous retroviruses or ERVs (Gifford and Tristem 2003; L\u00f6wer et al. 1996; Ryan 2009 ) are viruses that upon infection can horizontally insert their genetic material into their host genome. ERVs resemble retrotransposable elements (Nelson and Hooley 2004) , and they are often classified as a subtype of the latter. ERVs make use of the genetic apparatus of the somatic cells, but they can also integrate in the genomes of the sex cells and nestle inside the germ line. Once they become part of the germ line, the genes become the subject of vertical transmission where they are passed on to future generations in a Mendelian fashion. It is now well established that the genomes of mammals contain bits and pieces of these viruses in regions that were previously designated as \"junk DNA.\" The genomes that acquire retroviral genes, however, not merely serve as containers for the latter. On the contrary, the acquired retroviral genes often play crucial functional roles in developmental pathways. It has been proven that endogenous retroviruses played a significant role in the formation of the female placenta (Knerr et al. 2002; Sugimoto and Schust 2009) . Evidence furthermore suggests that our human ancestors caught endogenous retroviruses from Neanderthals (Marchi et al. 2013) . At least theoretically, it is likely that Neanderthals reciprocally caught some of our infectious diseases, which might have eventually contributed to their decline.",

Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease and BSE are also related in etiology and caused by similar prions. Prions are proteins that undergo post-translational, epigenetic changes in their three-dimensional folding structure. Thus, after the genetic code is transcribed and translated into proteins, the protein that makes up the prion undergoes further, non-genetically encoded alterations in form. What exactly causes the proteins to change form is still uncertain, but Spiroplasma bacteria have been implicated (Bastian et al. 2007 ). Once the proteins flip into prions and take on the altered morphological form, these prions can bind to the regular proteins and make them change form as well. The prion-induced disease is able to spread across the brain and causes neurodegenerative, spongiform diseases where the brain starts to shrink in size and morphologically starts to resemble a sponge.",

Writing in a time before \"lateral gene transfer\" as a notion was coined, he associated both infectious agents as well as the various means of prokaryotic horizontal gene exchange with symbiosis theory.
