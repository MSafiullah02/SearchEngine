Significant progress has been made recently toward developing highly specific anti-rhinovirus compounds (Wang et al., 1998, Matthews et al., 1999, Patick et al., 1999, Schiff and Sherwood, 2000) and specific influenza treatments are currently available. Since the symptoms of many viral respiratory infections overlap but the therapies are virus specific, rapid diagnostic tests performed at the point of care setting may contribute to appropriate administration of these new drugs. In addition, identification of a viral infection may reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics. Currently approximately 50% of patients diagnosed with colds or upper respiratory tract infection receive antibiotics, even though this treatment is unlikely to change the course of disease (Gonzales et al., 1997).",

The 3Cpro is responsible for the majority of cleavage events necessary for processing the viral polyprotein into the functional structural and enzymatic proteins required for viral replication. A significant degree of 3Cpro amino acid homology exists among diverse HRV serotypes, especially in the active site and RNA binding domain (Matthews et al., 1994, Walker et al., 1995, Meador et al., 1998, Palmenberg, 1998). Although 3Cpro is required throughout all stages of viral replication, it is not packaged into the mature virion (Rueckert, 1996). Therefore, the diagnostic clinical sample must contain infected cells or free 3Cpro originating from lysis of infected cells. The rapid test described in this study detects 3Cpro in expelled nasal secretions from HRV infected individuals and from virally infected cell culture lysates.",

Specific 3Cpro antibody is bound to the optical surface. An immune complex forms on the silicon surface between the surface capture antibody, 3Cpro, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeled detector antibodies. Addition of a precipitating substrate for HRP transduces the molecular surface binding events to mass deposition on the surface, creating a thin film and producing a visible color change. The increase in thickness alters the reflective properties of the optical surface such that the predominant reflective wavelengths shift from yellow and red to purple and blue (Ostroff et al., 1999b), indicating a positive result.",
