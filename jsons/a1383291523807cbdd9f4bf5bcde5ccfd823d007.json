They are used in their standard formulation, or through the many variants, trying to fit and hopefully predict the number of new cases for the next days or weeks, in any place, city, or country. Such is key knowledge for the authorities to prepare for the health systems demand or to apply restrictions to slow down the infectives curve. Even when the model can be easily solved -by the use of specialized software or by programming the numerical solution of the differential equations that represent the model-, the prediction is a non-easy task, because the behavioral change of people is reflected in a continuous change of the parameters. A relevant question is what we can use of one city to another; if what happened in Madrid could have been applied to New York and then, if what we have learned from this city would be of use for S\u00e3o Paulo. With this idea in mind, we present an analysis of a spreading-rate related measure of COVID-19 as a function of population density and population size for all US counties, as long as for Brazilian cities and German cities. Contrary to what is the common hypothesis in epidemics modeling, we observe a higher per-capita contact rate for higher city's population density and population size. Also, we find that the population size has a more explanatory effect than the population density. A contact rate scaling theory is proposed to explain the results.",

The N factor in the denominator makes \u03b2 a disease only parameter, supposedly independent of the size or other characteristic of the population. Indeed, in the book of Keeling and Rohani [2] this formulation is referred to as frequency-dependent (or mass action) transmission. Called it proportionate mixing by Anderson and May [3] , it assumes that the number of contacts is independent of the population size, resulting in similar patterns of transmission, whether it is a town or a large city. However, in the unprecedented evidence that we are collecting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, that common intuition seems not to be generally valid. On the opposite side, there is the pseudo-mass action formulation [2] , in which the infection rate is directly proportional to the population size -which is not usually applied to human infectious diseases. Our analysis shows that none of these extreme formulations can satisfactorily explain the available COVID-19 data. The best fit corresponds to a formulation that is somehow in between those ones, and which can be explained in terms of a contact rate scaling theory.",

There are two main competing hypothesis that try to explain how C varies with N and A: the population size driven contact rate, where C = C(N ); and the population density driven contact rate, stating that C = C(\u03c1), where \u03c1 = N/A. While the first approach assumes that the social mobility network grows in larger areas, allowing more distant people to interact [5] , the second one assumes that the length traveled by the individuals is invariant of the city's size [6] .",

Indeed, we have found that the best fit is \u03c1 \u221d N \u03bb , with \u03bb \u2248 1.03. Assuming a linear relation instead, \u03c1 = kN gives an equally valid fit, where k = A \u22121 = 0.00059km \u22122 . An almost constant density across counties, or no correlation between \u03c1 and N cannot explain the data.
