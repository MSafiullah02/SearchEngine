The viral population in the respiratory tracts of children without SARI was less diverse and mainly dominated by the Anelloviridae family, with only a small proportion of common epidemic respiratory viruses. 8 Although the agent most commonly detected in CAP is Streptococcus pneumoniae, 9 new, highly sensitive techniques have allowed us to detect many respiratory viruses associated with CAP, 9, 10 mostly influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and human metapneumovirus. [10] [11] [12] Rhinovirus and human coronavirus have also been detected. 10, 11, 13 Whether other still unidentified novel pathogens could cause CAP remains to be investigated.

The mucosa may also contain temporary microorganisms that are not part of the normal microflora. They may come from the environment, for example, from dust and from food and water. It is likely that a proportion of the sequences came from such microorganisms. Viral metagenomics clearly provides a crucial tool for virus discovery. With this approach, not priori information is needed, in contrast to directed PCR or Luminex assays, and viruses that are difficult to propagate in cell culture can be discovered. In this study, we detected a novel HPIV3 strain with a 32-bp insertion in the HN gene, highlighting the strength of the method to identify not only novel viruses but also viruses likely to be missed by ordinary clinical tests. Lysholm et al 5 also identified one novel type of Rhinovirus C and a number of previously undescribed viral genetic fragments of unknown origin using a metagenomic sequencing strategy. Using the high-throughput capacity of ultra-deep sequencing, Yang et al 7 detected a co-infected case of HEV with HRV that was missed by regular PCR testing. As sequencing continuously becomes more available and inexpensive, viral metagenomic analysis could also become a viable clinical diagnostic method in the future.

Picobirnavirus (PBV) is a novel group of viruses discovered in the late 1980s in clinical specimens from outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis in children.[40][41][42] However, PBV is frequently detected in non-diarrheic healthy hosts, and prolonged shedding has been observed in some individuals.43 Human PBV are poorly studied, and little is known about their pathogenicity. It is not even clear whether humans or intestinal microorganisms are hosts for these viruses. For human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV 1), because no more than 12 reads were detected and genome coverage of HIV were less than 1% for each four samples, one reasonable explanation was that the HIV related reads were due to contamination of the reagents used in sample process step, as murine leukemia virus (MLV) is commonly found in reverse transcriptase, and its shared extremely high homology with HIV in partial genome.Interestingly, several sequences related to bovine diarrhea virus were also present in the respiratory tracts of one specimen (BCHNP23), albeit at a lower frequency (52 reads)(Figure 3). In addition to zoonotic viruses, more than 20 plant-origin viruses were detected in the respiratory tracts of CAP children(Figure 3). The hosts of these plant viruses mainly include apple, cactus, cucumber, tomato, apricot, citrus, zucchini, watermelon, potato, fava bean, and pepper. These animal-and plant-origin sequences may be due to food debris in the oral cavity.Several other metagenomic analyses of the respiratory virome of children or adults have been conducted. As mentioned above, our previous study showed that members of the Paramyxoviridae, Coronaviridae, Parvoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Picornaviridae, Anelloviridae, and Adenoviridae families represented the mostabundant species identified in the respiratory tracts of children with severe acute respiratory infection. 8 Lysholm et al 5 used a metagenomic sequencing strategy to study nasopharyngeal aspirate samples from diagnosed respiratory tract infections and found most of the viral sequences were classified into one of three major families: Paramyxoviridae, Picornaviridae, or Orthomyxoviridae. Yang et al 7 identified seven species of known respiratory viruses (HAdV, RSV, HRV, influenza virus, HPIV, HBoV, and HEV) from nasopharyngeal aspirate samples from patients with acute lower respiratory tract infections. Here, we conducted a metagenomic analysis of the virome of children with CAP but noncommon respiratory virus infections. This study is the first to perform a full, detailed analysis of the virome of respiratory tract samples among children with CAP but non-common respiratory virus infection in childhood respiratory tracts, which will benefit the surveillance, prevention, and control of acute respiratory infections in children.Besides a number of known human viruses were detected in these clinical specimens, putatively viruses which are not generally associated with human CAP were also detected, such as EBV, hCMV, anellovirus, and WUPyV.

However, the genome coverage with HPIV3 was less than 3% for all specimens, and detection by conventional PCR was unsuccessful. It remains to be determined whether there was a crosscontamination exist during the sample preparation or the sequencing step, or the virus loads in these samples were generally low, or mutations and recombinations happened in virus strains which making detection using specific PCR detection method less likely. However, what could be definitely confirmed is that no outbreak has happened, because all the positive samples related with HPIV3 by metagenomic analysis derived from patients with different disease time and geographic origins.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF3": {"text": "", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "The authors have no potential conflicts of interest.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CONFLICT OF INTEREST"}, {"text": "Additional Supporting Information may be found online in the supporting information tab for this article.
