Although ROR\u03b3Tpos type-3 Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILC3) are characterized by their ability to produce IL-223, other cells such as NK cells4, alveolar macrophages5 and neutrophils6 have been suspected of producing IL-227. Owing to an almost restricted expression of the membrane IL-22 receptor (IL-22R) to epithelial cells8, IL-22 exerts crucial functions in regulating epithelial biology9. Based on antimicrobial peptides (AMP) and mucus production induction, the actions of IL-22 have been shown to be significant in fighting a number of extracellular bacteria and fungi at barrier surfaces of the gut and the lungs10\u201312. For example, IL-22 expression induced by C. albicans exposure in the lungs is protective against secondary PA infection13. In addition, IL-22 displays significant tissue-protective properties and supports epithelium wound healing and regeneration after injury by controlling epithelial cell proliferation, survival and differentiation14\u201316. Overall, these data suggest that IL-22 could limit epithelial lung injury during ARDS, especially when secondary to acute bacterial infection.",

This duality of IL-22 functions during inflammation probably reflects the significance of tissue context in determining the balance of IL-22 protective vs. deleterious actions on epithelial cells. In support of this idea, Sonnenberg et al. previously showed that during bleomycin-induced acute lung injury, the tissue-protective effects of IL-22 are overwhelmed by pro-inflammatory properties owing to the synergistic actions with IL-17 to recruit PMNs20. Therefore, it is not surprising that IL-22 possesses a specific system of regulation that is an IL-22 Binding Protein (IL-22BP), a secreted, soluble and specific inhibitor21 which we previously showed to be produced by a specific subset of immature dendritic cells in rodent gut that negatively regulates the protective actions of IL-22 during DSS-induced acute colitis22, 23.",

We addressed the impact of the in vivo administration of recombinant IL-22 before infection on lung damage after infection. As shown in Fig. 5a, intra-tracheal administration of 100ng of rIL-22 18 hours before the induction of pneumonia greatly decreased epithelial cell damage and lung oedema. In particular, rIL-22 administration significantly attenuated shrinking of the alveolar space during infection at 6 and 24 hours (Fig. 5b, p < 0.05 and p < 0.001 respectively). Since rIL-22 administration did not have an impact on bacteria load during pneumonia (Fig. 5c), we suspected an effect of rIL-22 on the host response. rIL-22 administration led to a moderate but significant decrease in PMN recruitment during infection as shown by Ly6-G IHC (Fig. 5d, right panel) and Ly6G surface staining quantification (Fig. 5e, p = 0.03). Interestingly, rIL-22 administration prior to infection tended to decrease MIP-2 expression in the lungs of infected mice compared with PBS-treated mice (p = 0.17) in contrast with IL-22 neutralisation which led to an increase of CXCL2 expression (Fig. 5f). IL-22 action is restricted to epithelial cells owing to the specific expression of the IL22RA1 receptor chain in these cells. Since IL-22 neutralisation impacted CXCL2 levels in the lungs and PMN recruitment, we explored the ability of rIL-22 to directly modulate IL-8 production on human epithelial A549 cell lines. As displayed in Fig. 5g, rIL-22 incubation on cells 18 hours before infection decreased IL-8 secretion during 6-hour PAO1 infection in a dose-effect manner (p < 0.01) confirming in vitro the effect of rIL-22 observed in vivo.\n",

The absence of bacterial burden modification suggests that the protective action IL-22 is not mediated by its direct anti-bacterial properties but rather through the ability of IL-22 to modulate host inflammatory response and susceptibility. To the best of our knowledge, the role of AMP in mucosal immunity in lungs has been poorly studied. It may be hypothesized that like in the gut, RegIII-\u03b3 regulates bacterial virulence by maintaining a zone of physical separation between the mucosal surface and bacteria without the need to decrease bacterial burden28. RegIII-\u03b3 could also interfere with the lung microbiome and decrease the virulence of PA.",

            "text": "IL-22 exhibits pro- or anti-inflammatory properties depending on the environment29. In our model, IL-22 acted as an anti-inflammatory molecule since it was correlated with PMN recruitment in the lungs. Tuning appropriate host response, especially PMN recruitment in response to pathogen aggression, is critical for host survival. PMN recruitment and activation during bacterial infection is a double-edged sword30. Neutropenic mice display exacerbated susceptibility of PA pneumonia31 and neutrophil depletion (by i.v. administration of Ly6-G neutralisation antibody) which led to a fatal lung infection in our model within 12 hours (data not shown). Failure to properly control PMN accumulation following pulmonary infection will contribute to tissue damage and ARDS26, 30, 32. In the context of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Guillon et al. showed that PMN proteases may alter IL-22 pathways leading to an increase in tissue damage33. The current results confirm that PA may alter the outcome of pneumonia through a massive recruitment of PMN in the lungs, thereby enhancing pulmonary lesions. Confirming these data, prophylactic administration of IL-22 correlated with a decrease in CXCL2 levels and PMN accumulation during infection. Although intra-tracheal administration of rIL-22 in the lung suggests a local effect, we cannot exclude systemic spreading of rIL-22 especially to the liver, an organ known to highly express IL22RA1. For example, in a model of pneumococcal pneumonia, G. Trevero-Nunez et al. demonstrated that liver-specific IL22RA1 deletion resulted in an increase of bacterial burden in the lungs34.",

This is consistent with the study by Hoegl et al. in which a diminution of CXCL2 levels in the lungs after IL-22 administration in a ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) model in rat was observed37. Moreover, current results show that IL-22-treated A549 human cell line secreted less IL-8 on infection as observed by H.A. Whittington et al.24. In our model, IL-22 could act as an immune-modulatory cytokine with anti-inflammatory properties. It is consistent with the role of this cytokine in the VILI model of Hoegl et al. where the authors found, aside from CXCL2 modulation, an increase of the immune-modulatory protein SOCS3 expression after IL-22 stimulation37. Finally, it has been shown that protease IV of PA alters IL-22 dependent lung defence33, highlighting the correlation between this pathogen, IL-22 and PMN recruitment.",

IL-22 BP is a soluble inhibitor of the IL-22 receptor that could be a major regulator of IL-22 in the context of bacterial pneumonia. Neutralising IL22-BP in our model induced a decreased susceptibility of the mice to the infection, decreased lung damage and PMN recruitment as observed with the administration of recombinant IL-22. These data underlined the significant role of IL-22BP in controlling IL-22 availability during pathological conditions such as acute pneumonia. Our data are in agreement with the G. F. Weber et al. study in which administration of recombinant IL-22BP-Fc resulted in an increase in PMN counts in a cecal legation puncture model of microbial sepsis40. More recently, we showed in the imiquimod-induced psoriasis model in mice, known to be IL-22 dependent, that in vivo neutralisation of IL-22BP with the same neutralising antibody used in the present study led to increased severity of psoriasis-like skin inflammation41. Taken together, our data highlighted the role of the IL-22/IL-22BP system during bacterial pneumonia and the need for additional studies to assess its therapeutic interest for patients suffering from bacterial pneumonia or ARDS.",
