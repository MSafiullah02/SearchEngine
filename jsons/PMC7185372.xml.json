In humans, cryptosporidiosis is the second cause of diarrhoea and death in children under five years of age after rotavirus (Striepen, 2013). In immunocompetent individuals the disease is self-limited, but it can be severe and life-threatening among immunocompromised subjects such as AIDS patients or those undergoing cancer chemotherapy or solid organ transplantation (Marcos and Gotuzzo, 2013). Cryptosporidiosis is also regarded as a significant cause of acute diarrhoea in farm ruminants affecting primarily neonatal animals (de Graaf et al., 1999). The clinical presentation of the infection vary from asymptomatic to deadly and, if improperly managed, can cause important economic loses associated to grow retardation, reduced productivity, and mortality (Sant\u00edn, 2013).",

Of them, anthoponotic C. hominis and zoonotic C. parvum are responsible for the vast majority of human infections documented globally (Xiao and Feng, 2008). Similarly, cattle are a primary reservoir for four Cryptosporidium species, namely C. parvum, C. bovis, C. ryanae, and C. andersoni, and are considered a major contributor of Cryptosporidium oocysts in the environment via manure spreading in farmlands or grazing on watersheds (Xiao and Feng, 2008). Bovine infections seem to follow an age-related distribution pattern, with C. parvum primarily detected in pre-weaned calves, C. bovis and C. ryanae in asymptomatic animals aged between one and 6 months, and C. andersoni in older cattle (Sant\u00edn et al., 2004, Sant\u00edn et al., 2008).",

            "text": "\nCryptosporidium is prevalent in both humans and domestic animals in Africa, although the molecular diversity and geographical distribution of the parasite is still largely unknown in many regions of the continent (Squire and Ryan, 2017). In Algeria, microscopy-based studies have documented the presence of Cryptosporidium infections in 0.1% to 30% of the human populations surveyed (Benouis et al., 2013; Hamaidi-Chergui et al., 2013). Using the same diagnostic method, bovine cryptosporidiosis has been reported at infection rates varying from 19% to 84% in a limited number of epidemiological investigations conducted in the provinces of Bejaia, Setif, and Souk Ahras (Ouchene et al., 2014), Annaba and Eltarf (Hocine et al., 2016), and Batna (Benhouda et al., 2017) in the North-eastern part of the country. Molecular information on the presence and relative frequency of Cryptosporidium species are also scarce, with few studies reporting infections by C. bovis, C. ryanae, C. parvum, and C. andersoni in cattle (Baroudi et al., 2017; Benhouda et al., 2017), by C. baileyi and C. meleagridis in poultry and wild birds (Baroudi et al., 2013; Laatamna et al., 2017), and by C. erinacei, C. parvum, C. hominis, and C muris in horses and donkeys (Laatamna et al., 2013, Laatamna et al., 2015). Although no molecular data from human isolates are currently available, taken together this information indicates that Cryptosporidium infections seem common in Algeria and transmission of the parasite may involve a number of different pathways. In order to clarify this epidemiological scenario, we present here novel data on the presence, molecular diversity and frequency of Cryptosporidium in neonatal calves from three geographically different Algerian regions. We used genotyping and subtyping tools for the molecular investigation of the obtained Cryptosporidium isolates.",

C. parvum infections prevailed in calves in the 16\u201330 days age group too, with the exception of two (one symptomatic, one asymptomatic) calves infected by C. bovis. However, C. parvum infections were absent in calves older than 30 days, where C. bovis was the most prevalent (67%) species found. Additionally, a single infection by C. andersoni was found in an 18-month-old, asymptomatic heifer (Table 3). No apparent differences in the geographical distribution of Cryptosporidium infections were noted. Both C. parvum and C. bovis evidenced a rather wide distribution, being present in the three Algerian regions under study. C. parvum was present in all exploitations investigated except farms 1 and 3, whereas C. bovis was found in farms 1, 3, 8, and 9.

Using a variety of diagnostic methods, bovine cryptosporidiosis has also been documented, mainly in calves, at 32% in Egypt (Helmy et al., 2015), 29% in Madagascar (Bodager et al., 2015), 52% in Nigeria (Ayinmode et al., 2010), and 87% in Tunisia (Soltane et al., 2007). Despite the fact that herd prevalence was 100%, Cryptosporidium infections were significantly more common in farms located in north-Central Algeria. Overall, these findings strongly suggest that bovine cryptosporidiosis is endemic in the country, with spatial variations of prevalence probably reflecting differences in herd and farm management practices. Our results also revealed that Cryptosporidium-associated diarrhoea primarily affects pre-weaned (up to one month-old) calves, with older animals mostly harbouring sub-clinical infections. This is in agreement with previous studies showing that neonatal calves are highly susceptible to Cryptosporidium infections because of their immature immune system and high exposure to manure or equipment contaminated with oocysts of the parasite (e.g. Foster and Smith, 2009; Murakoshi et al., 2013; Bj\u00f6rkman et al., 2015).",

This very same test has been previously used in similar veterinary epidemiological surveys conducted in Iran (Badiei et al., 2011) and Iraq (Al-Robaiee and Al-Farwachi, 2014). Unfortunately, no other comparative diagnostic methods were simultaneously used in those investigations, making impossible to evaluate the actual diagnostic sensitivity of the CpAg-ELISA in field conditions. A number of commercial and in-house CpAg-ELISA tests have been developed for the detection of Cryptosporidium in faecal material from human (Garcia and Shimizu, 1997; Chalmers et al., 2011) or animal (Kuhnert-Paul et al., 2012; Ezzaty Mirhashemi et al., 2015) origin. When compared against PCR as gold standard, enzyme immunoassays typically achieved diagnostic sensitivities in the rage of 91\u201393%, significantly higher than those provided by the modified Ziehl-Neelsen microscopy (Chalmers et al., 2011; Kuhnert-Paul et al., 2012). Although some surveys have reported reduced capacity of ELISA to identify the presence of Cryptosporidium antigens in samples with low numbers of oocysts in human (Johnston et al., 2003) and animal (Ezzaty Mirhashemi et al., 2015) faecal specimens, this does not seem to be the case of our study, where a large proportion of the samples corresponded to symptomatic calves, expected to have high parasite burdens.",

Among them, C. parvum shows a marked host age-related susceptibility and has been identified as the most dominant Cryptosporidium species infecting pre-weaned calves, particularly by the subtype IIaA15G2R1, in different studies worldwide (Sant\u00edn et al., 2004, Sant\u00edn et al., 2008; Geurden et al., 2007; Wielinga et al., 2008; Rieux et al., 2013). This was indeed the case of our study, where C. parvum was responsible for the majority (84%) of the infections in calves in the 2\u201330 days age group. Interestingly all C. parvum isolates were assigned to IIaA16G2R1, a sub-genotype less frequently documented causing bovine infections but already described in cattle in Algeria (Baroudi et al., 2017), Belgium (Geurden et al., 2007), and Spain (Quilez et al., 2008), and in yaks in China (Mi et al., 2013). Human infections by IIaA16G2R1 have also been reported in clinical and paediatric populations in Democratic Republic of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Principe (Lobo et al., 2014) and Iran (Sharbatkhori et al., 2015; Ranjbar et al., 2016), highlighting the zoonotic potential of this C. parvum sub-genotype. It is also worth mentioning that other members of the sub-type family IIa found infecting Algerian cattle include IIaA13G2R1 (Benhouda et al., 2017) and IIaA17G3R1 (Baroudi et al., 2017), whereas IIaA15G2R1 has not been identified in isolates of human or animal origin in the country to date.",

Cryptosporidium infection greatly contributes to the burden of diarrhoeal disease in neonatal calves, very likely causing severe (although still unquantified) economic losses due to morbidity and mortality. Generated molecular data evidenced the presence of potentially zoonotic C. parvum sub-genotypes, a finding of public health relevance taking into account the extremely high environmental load of oocysts generated by calves at the peak of the infection. This situation highlights the importance of implementing proper farm management practices to effectively reduce the Cryptosporidium burden on affected farms.",
