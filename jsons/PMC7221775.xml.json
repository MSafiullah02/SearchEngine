This rather inaccurate definition mostly refers to species belonging to the phyla Basidiomycota and Ascomycota. The total number of species of the kingdom fungi is far from being exactly known. It was believed to be around 1.5 millions [1], but more recent estimates have increased the number to a range of 2.2\u20133.8 millions, worldwide [2]. With 120,000 currently accepted species, it appears that at best just 8% and, in the worst case scenario just 3%, are named so far [2]. The species of fungi described so far are about 120,000. About 35,000 fungal species belong to the phylum Basidiomycota, which comprises the majority of \u201cmushrooms\u201d [3].",

In fact, mushrooms contain amino acids, fatty acids (many of them being unsaturated or poly-unsaturated, such as oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids), vitamins, sterols, and some essential minerals [7,8,9,10,11,12,13]. As concerns carbohydrates, the most abundant sugar present is trehalose, the \u03b11 \u2192 \u03b11 dimer of d-glucose, which is responsible of several alimentary intolerances in people who digest it with difficulty. More elaborate polysaccharides comprise chitin, the fungal fiber, which is a homopolymer of N-acetylglucosamine and other sugars occurring in fungal cell walls. Notwithstanding the edible properties, a word of warning must be added, about the possibility that toxic metals such as arsenic, mercury, etc. occur in edible mushrooms collected from polluted soils [14,15,16].",

Comparing with the rest of the world, Southeast Asia is more rural as 41.8% of the nearly 590 million people live in the countryside in 2010 [27]. The climate, sea level fluctuations and biotas of this region seem to have created a habit favoring the explosive growth of countless new animal and plants species. In the region surrounding the Mekong river, 2077 new animal and plants species have been described since 1997 and 367 new species were added to the new species record in only two years, 2012\u20132013 [29].

Therefore, the biodiversity of Southeast Asia is likely to be a vast reservoir for finding new mushroom species, since fungi occurring in Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia have barely been studied so far [30]. Moreover, it is worth noting that numerous ethnic groups living in Southeast Asian countries resort to several wild mushrooms for obtaining food and medicines; however, very few studies have been carried out on the nutritional value and biological activities of these mushrooms. This review has collected the information available in the literature on the phytochemical constituents of selected wild edible mushrooms occurring in Southeast Asian countries, namely Agaricus silvaticus, Ampulloclitocybe clavipes, Butyriboletus roseoflavus, Cantharellus cibarius (Figure 2a), Craterellus cornucopioides, Craterellus odoratus, Fistulina hepatica, Hydnum repandum (Figure 2b), Laccaria amethystea, Lactarius hatsudake, Lepista sordida (Figure 2c), Lycoperdon pyriforme (Figure 2d), Neolentinus lepideus (Figure 2e), Phlebopus portentosus, Polyozellus multiplex, Ramaria botrytis, Rugiboletus extremiorientalis, Russula virescens (Figure 2f), Sarcodon imbricatus, Termitomyces albuminosus, Termitomyces eurhizus, Termitomyces heimii, Termitomyces microcarpus, Thelephora ganbajun, and Volvariella bombycina. These species were selected on the basis of their wide use as a food in Southeast Asia and difficult cultivation. Moreover, they are among the most common mushrooms growing in this part of the world. Likewise all selected macrofungi are a natural resource of economic, ecological, scientific and cultural importance among ethnic groups in Southeast Asia.",

Most cells in our body produce antioxidant and repair systems which protect them against oxidative damage; however, these systems are often insufficient to prevent or repair the damage entirely [36]. Therefore, the introduction in the body of additional antioxidant agents from the diet is believed to be critical for maintaining cell homeostasis and thus a healthy organism [37]. Although synthetic antioxidants such as butylhydroxyanisole (BHA), butylhydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate (PG) and tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) have commonly been used as antioxidant additives in foods for years, their safety has long been questioned [38]. This finding has led to an increased interest in natural antioxidants. Antioxidant activities of extracts and isolated compounds from edible mushrooms have been determined by several research groups that used different tests in vitro to measure the reducing power ability, the total antioxidant activity, the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity, the lipid peroxide inhibitory activity, the ferric reducing antioxidant power, the nitric oxide (NO) scavenging activity, and the ABTS radical scavenging, superoxide radical, and hydroxyl radical scavenging properties. Thus, a large number of results in the literature clearly indicates that several edible mushrooms have significant antioxidant properties due to their bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols, polysaccharides, vitamins, carotenoids and minerals [18,39,40,41].",

[57] investigated the chemical components of A. silvaticus and identified 5\u03b1,6\u03b1-epoxy-(22E,24R)-ergosta-8(14),22-diene-3\u03b2,7\u03b1-diol (1 in Figure 3), ergosterol, ergosterol peroxide, (22E,24R)-ergosta-7,22-diene-3\u03b2,5\u03b1,6\u03b2,9\u03b1-tetraol (2), cerevisterol (3), (2R,3S,4R,6E)-N-[(R)-2\u2032-hydroxytetracosanoyl]-1,3,4-trihydroxy-2-amino-octadeca-6-ene, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid and d-mannitol. The antimicrobial activity of A. silvaticus has not been reported, whereas the antioxidant activity has been determined [63,64].",

It is a wild mushroom growing in China, Thailand, and Japan [4,58,65]. Clavilactones A\u2013C (4\u20136, Figure 4) were isolated in an Italian laboratory from a culture of the fungus and exhibited antifungal and antibacterial activities [66]. The structures of clavilactones D and E (7), were initially inferred by 1- and 2-D NMR data [67]. However, the subsequent total synthesis of clavilactones A, B, and D led to a revision of the original structure of clavilactone D which was established to be as formula (8) in Figure 4 [68]. Clavilactone A, B, and D displayed potent inhibitory activity in kinase assays against the Ret/ptc1 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinases [67,69]. Subsequently, Sun et al. [70] isolated from a fungal strain of A. clavipes, clavilactone F (12) together with three novel meroterpenoids, named clavipines A\u2013C (9\u201311), which exhibit a benzoquinone ring fused to an azepine ring and a ten-membered carbocycle bearing an \u03b1,\u03b2-epoxy/unsaturated-\u03b3-lactone. Compound 9 exhibited significant antiproliferative activity against HepG2 and A549 cells with IC50 values of 4.28 \u00b1 0.26 and 7.49 \u00b1 0.41 \u03bcM, respectively [70]. Subsequently, clavipols A\u2013B (13\u201314) containing a 12-membered ether ring and clavilactones G\u2013I (15\u201317) were isolated from the fruiting bodies of A. clavipes collected in China. Compound 16 exhibited moderate cytotoxic activity against Hela and SGC-7901 cancer cell lines, with IC50 values of 23.5 and 14.5 \u00b5M, respectively [71]. Five fatty acid derivatives, isolated from A. clavipes have been reported to have potent strong inhibitory activity against aldehyde dehydrogenase [65].",

This edible mushroom grows abundantly in Southern China (Yunnan) and Thailand, and it is commonly sold in street markets [4,58]. A group of Chinese researchers reported the isolation, from the fruiting bodies of a novel heteropolysaccharide, which has a backbone of (1\u21924)-\u03b1-l-mannopyranose residues, which branched at O-6. The branches are mainly composed of one with \u21921)-\u03b1-d-galactopyranose residue [72]. In addition to a strong antioxidant activity [72], this polysaccharide with a unique structure activates the secretion of cytokines from immune cells and inhibits the growth of Hep-2 cells. The concentration of 400 \u03bcg/mL has the highest inhibitory rate [73,74]. A new water-soluble polysaccharide, having a backbone of 1,4-linked \u03b2-d-glucose, with branches mainly composed of two 1,6-linked \u03b1-d-galactose residues and bearing a 4-linked \u03b2-d-glucose unit at the end of the branches, has been reported to exhibit unique antitumor and immunoregulatory properties [75]. Sun et al. [76] reported that hemagglutinin isolated from B. speciosus, showed antiproliferative activity towards hepatoma Hep G2 cells and mouse lymphocytic leukemia cells (L1210) in vitro, with an IC50 of 4.7 \u03bcM and 7.0 \u03bcM, respectively. It also exhibited HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity with an IC50 of 7.1 \u03bcM.",

These macromolecules showed a wide range of biological activities, such as antioxidant, antitumor, antiproliferative, immunomodulatory and neuroprotective properties [80,81,82,83,84,85,86]. Mittermeier et al. [87] investigated the taste active and taste modulating compounds from this mushroom by LC\u2013MS and 1D/2D-NMR experiments and identified several C18-acetylenic acids: 14,15-dehydrocrepenynic acid methyl ester, 14,15-dehydrocrepenynic acid ethyl ester, 14,15-dehydrocrepenynic acid, (9Z,15E)-14,17,18-trihydroxy-9,15-octadecadien-12-ynoic acid, (9Z,15E)-14-oxo-9,15-octadecadien-12-ynoic acid, (10E,15E)-9-hydroxy-14-oxo-10,15-octadecadien-12-ynoic acid, (10E,15E)-9-hydroperoxy-14-oxo-10,15-octadecadien-12-ynoic acid, (10E,15E)-9,14-dioxo-10,15-octadecadien-12-ynoic acid, (9Z,15E)- 14-oxo-9,15-octadecadien-12-ynoic acid methyl ester, (9Z,15E)-17(18)-epoxy-14-oxo-9,15-octadecadien-12-ynoic acid methyl ester, (10E,14Z)-9-hydroperoxy-10,14-octadecadien-12-ynoic acid, (10E,14Z)-12-hydroxy-10,14-octadecadienoic acid, (9Z,11Z)-14,18-dihydroxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid, (9Z,11Z)-14,17,18-trihydroxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid, (10E,14Z)-9-hydroxy-10,14-octadecadien-12-ynoic acid and (10E,14Z)-9-oxo-10,14-octadecadien-12-ynoic acid.

            "text": "Craterellus cornucopioides (L.Fr.) Pers. (family-Cantharellaceae) is an edible fungus with a wide distribution in Europe, North America, Korea, Japan, China, and Thailand [4,58,94,95]. A new triple-helix polysaccharide, a heteroglycan with (1\u21923)-linked-\u03b2-d-Manp-(1\u21926)-linked \u03b1-d-Galp backbone distributed by (1\u21924)-linked-\u03b1-d-Xylp-t-\u03b1-d-Manp and t-\u03b2-d-Glup units at O-6, was isolated from C. cornucopioides. This compound activated RAW264.7 macrophages in vitro, and enhanced the immunomodulatory activity in immunosuppressive mice models [94,95,96]. Yang et al. [97] isolated a novel polysaccharide fraction from the fruiting bodies. The dominant linkage types were \u21923,6)-Manp (1\u2192, T-Araf, \u21924,6)-Manp (1\u2192, \u21925)-Araf (1\u2192 and \u21923)-Araf (1\u2192). The polysaccharide possessed strong scavenging abilities on DPPH and ABTS radicals. Three illudin sesquiterpenoids, craterellins A\u2013C (structures 18\u201320 in Figure 5), and one gymnomitrane sesquiterpenoid, gymnomitr-3-en-10\u03b2,15-diol (21), together with illudin F, illudin M, illudin T and illudalenol were isolated in China from cultures of this mushroom. Compound 20 exhibited moderate cytotoxicity against A-549 cells with an IC50 value of 21.0 \u03bcM [98]. In addition to a new menthane monoterpene, 4-hydroxy-4-isopropenylcyclohexanemethanol acetate (22), craterellins D (23) and E (24) were later isolated from fungal cultures after minor modifications of the original cultural conditions. The cytotoxic activities of these compounds on five tumor cell lines were also reported [99]. Three new keto esters, 4-oxo-hex-1,6-diyl diacetate, 4-oxo-hex-5-enyl acetate and 6-hydroxy-4-oxo-hexyl acetate were isolated from a tissue culture of fruiting bodies of C. cornucopioides collected in China [100]. Magnus\u2019s group isolated three tryptophol (indole-3-ethanol) derivatives, namely 2-(indol-3-yl)ethyl octadeca-(9Z)-enoate (structure 25 in Figure 5), 2-(indol-3-yl)ethyl octadeca-(9Z,12Z)-dienoate and 2-(indol-3-yl)ethyl octadeca-(9Z,14Z)-dien-12-ynoate from the fruiting bodies of this mushroom [101]. Glycerol tri-dehydrocrepenynate, glycerol trioleate and glycerol linoleate dioleate were also isolated by the same research group [102]. Piceatannol, vitamin B12, ergosterol and ergosteryl derivatives are other chemical constituents isolated from C. cornucopioides [93,103,104]. Various extracts of C. cornucopioides showed antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activities [91,93,105,106,107,108].",

Three rare merosesquiterpenoids, named craterellins A\u2013C (26\u201328 in Figure 6), were isolated from cultures of C. odoratus together with known massarinolin C. They showed inhibitory activities of 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (11\u03b2-HSD1 and 11\u03b2-HSD2) [111]. Craterellin A (26) demonstrated significant a inhibitory activity against human 11\u03b2-HSD2 with an IC50 value of 1.5 \u00b5g/mL [111]. Craterellin D (29), 5-hydroxymethyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-phenylethanone, 2-(1,2-dihydroxypropan-2-yl) benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, 6\u03b1-hydroxy-3-methoxy-4\u03b1-methyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one have been isolated from the cultures of C. odoratus. 5-hydroxymethyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-phenylethanone exhibited inhibitory activity against human 11\u03b2-HSD1 with an IC50 value of 16.4 \u00b5g/mL [109]. Guo et al. [112] extensively studied the cultures of C. odoratus and identified five new polyketides, named craterellones A\u2013E (structures 30\u201334 in Figure 6), together with the known compounds decumbenones A and B, versiol, calbistrin A and calbistrin C. Their cytotoxic activities were reported [112]. Subsequently, the Chinese research group reported the chemical structures of two rare 4,6-dimethyl-3,4-dihydrochromen-2-one derivatives, cralactones A (35) and B (36), which were isolated from the culture broth of C. odoratus. The pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity of the compounds were also described [113]. Recently, the origin of these isolated compounds has been discussed. In fact, it has been debated if they are true metabolites of C. odoratus or are formed by the associated fungus Montagnula donacina [114].",

It is distributed in temperate and subtropical hardwood forests of China, Thailand, Hungary, Portugal [4,58,115,116], and other European countries. Two novel triacetylene derivatives have been isolated from the fruiting bodies and named cinnatriacetins A (37) and B (38) [117]. Compounds 37 and 38 (see structures in Figure 7) showed antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria, but no activity towards gram-negative bacteria [117]. Caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, ellagic acid, hyperoside, quercetin, oxalic acid, aconitic acid, citric acid, malic acid, ascorbic acid and fumaric acid were also isolated from F. hepatica, and an aqueous extract showed a significant scavenger activity of DPPH\u2022 and superoxide radicals [118]. A sample of F. hepatica collected in Portugal contained tocopherols and showed strong antioxidant activity [115,119]. Ribeiro and his co-workers extensively studied the free amino acid and fatty acid composition of F. hepatica, comparing their contents with those of other wild edible mushrooms [120,121]. Wu et al. [122] studied the volatile compounds from the fruiting bodies and 11 compounds were identified as responsible for the characteristic odor of the fungus. They were: 1-octen-3-one, 1-octen-3-ol, linalool, phenylacetaldehyde, butanoic acid, (E)-2-methyl-2-butenoic acid, methyl (E)-cinnamate, (Z)-9-hexadecenoic acid methyl ester, bisabolol oxide B, phenylacetic acid, and an undetermined mouldy compound. (E)-2-Methyl-2-butenoic acid and bisabolol oxide B have not been identified as native fungal volatile metabolites. Other studies on the volatiles from F. hepatica have been performed in Portugal and German laboratories [123,124]. A methanol/water (80:20) extract of F. hepatica collected in Portugal inhibited the growth of gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Morganella morganni and Pasteurella multocida) and gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes) bacteria [22]. Moreover, the crude extract showed high synergistic effects in combination with cefuroxime against MRSA [116,125].",

Antioxidant, antiproliferative, cytotoxic, and pro-apoptotic activities of H. repandum were investigated by Vasdekis and collaborators. A significant cytotoxicity (IC50 = 1.0 mg \u00b7 mL\u22121) was determined against an A549 cell line, and, piceatannol was identified by LC/MS and MS analysis [93]. The influence of H. repandum extract on the growth and sporulation of Penicillium expansum was studied in vitro. A significant reduction of the mycelial growth and inhibition of the pathogen sporulation were observed [131]. In vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant susceptibility studies were performed by many research groups [92,115,126,127,132,133].",

Tanaka, belonging to the genus Lactarius of the family Russulaceae, is an edible, slightly bitter mushroom, which is widely distributed in China, Thailand and Bhutan [4,58]. Artificial cultures are obtained with difficulty [136]. A review on the secondary metabolites isolated from the fruiting bodies of European Lactarius species [137] does not include this mushrooom, which is a typical Asian species for which a limited number of reports exists. Miyazawa et al. [138] studied the components of the volatile oil from this mushroom. cis-Isolongifolanone, \u03b1-cedrene epoxide, humulene epoxide III, clovane, linoleic acid and palmitoleic acid were the main components among the 71 identified compounds. Ergosterol, ergosterol peroxide, 5\u03b1,8\u03b1-epidioxy-(24S)-ergosta-6-en-3\u03b2-ol and (22E,24R)-ergosta-7,22-dien-3\u03b2,5\u03b1,6\u03b2-triol were isolated from the fruiting bodies, and their inhibitory activitities against Crotalus adamenteus venom phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzyme and HIV in vitro were reported [139,140]. Fang et al. [141] isolated 7-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)-4-methylazulene-1-carbaldehyde (structure 44 in Figure 10), 4-methyl-7-(1-methylethyl) azulene-1-carboxylic acid (45) and 4-methyl-7-(1-methylethyl)azulene-1-carbaldehyde from the fruiting bodies. Other new guaiane sesquiterpenes, called lactariolines A and B (structures 46 and 47, respectively, in Figure 10), together with known 4-methyl-7-isopropylazulene- 1-carboxylic acid, 1-formyl-4-methyl-7-isopropyl azulene, lactaroviolin and 1-formyl-4-methyl-7-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl) azulene, were isolated by a Korean research group [142].",

Singer, a basidiomycetous fungus of the family Tricholomataceae, is an edible and medicinal agaric species which grows in the wild in China, Thailand, Korea [4,58,143]. Moreover, there is a report on the artificial cultivation of a wild strain of L. sordida from Thailand [144]. A water-soluble polysaccharide isolated from the fruiting bodies, which significantly increased the nitric oxide and NF-\u03b1 release from macrophages, was established to have a backbone consisting of (1\u21926)-linked-\u03b1-d-glucopyranosyl and (1\u21922,6)-linked-\u03b1-d-glucopyranosyl residues, terminated with a terminal (1\u2192)-\u03b1-d-galactopyranosyl residue at the O-3 position of a (1\u21922,6)-linked-\u03b1-d-glucopyranosyl residue along the main chain [145]. Miao and co-worker extracted four water-soluble polysaccharides from the fruiting bodies which showed potent antiproliferative effects on human laryngocarcinoma Hep-2 cells in vitro and in vivo [146,147]. Intracellular polysaccharides from mycelium of L. sordida have demonstrated to possess a significant free radical-scavenging activity in vitro on hydroxyl, superoxide anion and DPPH radicals [148]. Two new diterpenoids, lepistal and lepistol (structures 48 and 49, respectively in Figure 11), were isolated from fungal fermentations of L. sordida collected in France [149]. Aldehyde 48 was more active than alcohol 49 as regards the cytotoxic, antibacterial and antifungal activities [149]. Compounds 50\u201352 (see structures in Figure 11), named lepistamides A\u2013C, were also isolated, in conjunction with diatretol, from samples of L. sordida collected in China [150]. A group of Japanese researchers isolated plant-growth regulating compounds, 2-azahypoxanthine (53), 2-aza-8-oxohypoxanthine (54), and imidazole-4-carboxamide (55) [151,152,153,154], whereas compounds 56\u201359 (see structures in Figure 11), showing inhibitory activity of the bentgrass root growth, were isolated from a culture broth [155]. The isolation of three new chlorinated sesquiterpenes from a culture broth of L. sordida, named lepistatins A\u2013C (see structures 60\u201362 in Figure 11), was reported by a Korean research group along with their antibacterial and antiproliferative activities [143]. In conclusion, polysaccharides from L. sordida were determined to possess immunoregulatory [145], antiproliferative [146], anticancer [146,147], and antiradical activities [148], while different secondary metabolites showed antimicrobial [149], cytotoxic [149], and plant growth regulatory activities [151,152,153,154].",

Another research group isolated 4-methoxy-benzene-1-azoformamide (63), 4-methoxybenzene-1-ONN-azoxyformamide (64) and 3,5-dichloro-4-methoxybenzene-1-ONN-azoxyformamide (65) [158]. Compounds 63 and 64 (see structures in Figure 12) were active against the plant parasitic nematode Meloidogyne incognita, and showed weak antimicrobial effects against Nadsonia fulvescens and Penicillium notatum. Compound 65 (see structure in Figure 12) exhibited weak cytotoxicity against L1210, HL-60, and HeLa S3 cells [158]. L. pyrifonne has also been reported to contain linoleic, oleic, palmitic, stearic, 9-eicosenoic, 9,12-eicosadienoic, tricosanoic, pentacosanoic, hexacosanoic, and 11-hexacosenoic acids [156].

It grows in China, Thailand, Japan and Korea [4,58,162,163]. It is worth noting that while some authors qualify this mushroom as edible, others describe it as inedible. Hanssen extensively studied the liquid cultures and reported the presence of (\u2212)-torreyol, (\u2212)-T-muurolol, (+)-T-cadinol, (\u2212)-\u03b1-cadinol, cubenol, epicubenol, trans,trans-farnesol, drimenol, \u03b1-copaene, \u03b1-elemene, trans-\u03b2-farnesene, \u03b3-muurolene, \u03b1-muurolene, \u03b4-cadinene, cadina-1,4-diene and calacorene [164,165]. A new \u03b3-pyrone derivative, named lepidepyrone (see structure 66 in Figure 13), together with methyl 3-hydroxy-4-methoxycinnamate and ergosterol were isolated from the cultured mycelium of the mushroom. Compound 66 showed high inhibitory activity on mammalian HAase with an IC50 = 3.3 mM [162]. Phytochemical investigations of N. lepideus established the presence in the fruiting bodies of two new secondary metabolites, 5-methoxyisobenzofuran-4,7(1H,3H)-dione (67) and 1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-4,6-diol (68), together with the known compounds 5-methoxy-2,3-dimethylcyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione, (E)-3-(3-methoxyphenyl)acrylic acid, 3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propan-1-ol, (E)-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)acrylic acid, methyl (E)-3-(2-methoxyphenyl)acrylate, methyl (E)-3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)acrylate, and methyl (E)-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)acrylate [166]. Compounds 67 and 68 (see structures in Figure 13) showed nitric oxide inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 6.2 \u00b5M and 88.8 \u00b5M, respectively. In addition, compound 68 displayed antioxidant activity with an IC50 value of 68.6 \u00b5M [166]. 1,3-Dihydroisobenzofuran-4,5,7-triol (69) and 5-methoxy-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-4,7-diol (70) were isolated from an EtOAc extract of a culture filtrate and showed tyrosinase inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 173 and 263 \u03bcg/mL, respectively [167]. Extracts from the fruiting bodies of N. lepideus have been reported to possess antioxidant [168], antityrosinase [168], antihyperlipidemic [163], and immunomodulating activities [169,170].",

[173] evaluated the antioxidant, anti-tyrosinase, and antihyperglycaemic activities of P. portentosus as well as the phenolic content, comparing it with other three wild edible mushrooms. Three novel pyrrole alkaloids, named phlebopines A\u2013C (structures 71\u201373 in Figure 14), together with four known ones, 2-[2-formyl-5-(methoxymethyl)-1H-pyrrole-1-yl]propanoate, inotopyrrole, 1-isopentyl-2-formyl-5-hydroxy-methylpyrrole and inotopyrrole B (74), were isolated from fruiting bodies collected in China. Among these isolated compounds, inotopyrrole B (74) displayed remarkable neuroprotective effects against hydrogen peroxide-induced neuronal-cell damage in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells [174].",

            "text": "Polyozellus multiplex (Underw.) Murrill, belonging to the family Thelephoraceae, grows in the wild in Japan, Korea, China, and Thailand [4,58,175]. A new inhibitor of prolyl endopeptidase (PEP) with an IC50 value of 2.72 \u00b5M, named polyozellin, was identified from a methanolic extract of fresh fruiting bodies collected in Korea [176]. The total synthesis of polyozellin by Takahashi and his collaborators led to a revision of the structure which was determined to be 75 [177]. A Korean research group investigated the EtOAc soluble fraction of the mushroom and reported the chemical structure of two active compounds, thelephoric acid (76) and kynapcin-9 (77) with their PEP activities [178]. Another p-terphenyl derivative, named kynapcin-12, having PEP inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 1.25 \u00b5M, was isolated by Lee and collaborators from a methanolic extract [179]. The correct chemical structure of kynapcin-12 (78) was later assigned by total synthesis [180]. Polyozellic acid (79), and the acetone adduct (80), together with thelephoric acid, were isolated from P. multiplex collected in Japan and showed inhibitory effects on the proliferation, tubule formation, and invasion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells [181]. Compounds 75, 76, 78, and 79 (see structures in Figure 15) inhibited BACE1 activity with IC50 values of 3.08, 3.50, 4.78, and 15.79 \u03bcM, respectively, and neuroprotective activities in glutamate-induced HT22 cell death [175]. Kim et al. [182] reported the isolation of two new benzofurans, named kynapcin-13 (81) and kynapcin-28 (82), from P multiplex, which inhibited prolyl endopeptidase with IC50 values of 76.80 and 0.98 \u03bcM, respectively. Another new benzofuran dimer, kynapcin-24 (83), was later isolated from P multiplex. It inhibited PEP with an IC50 value of 1.14 \u00b5M [183]. Separation of a methanol extract of fruiting bodies of P multiplex collected in Korea afforded linoleic acid and oleic acid together with thelephoric acid [184]. Extracts of this mushroom were reported to have inhibitory effects on the proliferation of cancer cell lines [185], inhibitory activities (IC50 10 \u03bcg/mL) against \u03b1-glucosidase [186] and DPPH radical scavenging activity [187]. Finally, it is worthy of note that polyozellin exhibits high important bioactivities, such as antioxidant [187], anti-carcinogenic [188] and inflammatory activities [189,190,191,192,193,194,195].",

Bourdot, belonging to the family Ramariaceae, is a wild edible mushrooms which grows in mountains of eastern Asia, China, Thailand, Europe, and North America [4,58,196]. Zhou et al. reported the isolation of a novel ubiquitin-like antitumour protein which significantly inhibited the growth and induced apoptosis in A549 cells [196]. Bhanja and his collaborators isolated two water-insoluble glucans from the fruiting bodies of R. botrytis collected in India. One glucan was composed of (1\u21923)-linked \u03b1-d-glucopyranosyl residues and the other one was a \u03b2-d-glucan with a backbone of four (1\u21923)-linked \u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl units, with one single unit \u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl branch substituted at O-6 position [197]. A glucan consisting of (1\u21926)-linked-\u03b2-d glucopyranosyl residues as backbone, branched at O-3 position with a (1\u21923)-linked-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl unit and a non-reducing end \u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl residue has been purified by the same research group. This glucan showed immunostimulating activity on RAW 264.7, a murine macrophage cell line, by nitric oxide production [198]. Moreover, polysaccharides from R. botrytis showed potent antioxidant activities [199]. Fresh fruiting bodies of the mushroom collected in Japan have been reported to contain (2S,2\u2032R,3R,4E,8E)-N-2\u2032-hydroxyoctadecanoyl-2-amino-9-methyl-4,8-heptadecadiene-1,3-diol, 5\u03b1,6\u03b1-epoxy-3\u03b2-hydroxy-(22E)-ergosta-8(14),22-dien-7-one, ergosterol peroxide, cerevisterol and 9\u03b1-hydroxycerevisterol [200].

It grows in nature on the roots of pine trees throughout China, Thailand, Lao, Nepal, and Europe [4,58]. The mushroom has long been used as a folk remedy in the traditional Chinese medicine [208]. Zhu et al. purified a novel laccase from R. virescens and then studied its dye decolorizing properties [209]. A water-insoluble linear (1\u21923)-\u03b2-d-glucan from the fresh fruiting bodies was isolated by the Sun\u2019s group and did not exhibit antitumor activity, however, the sulfation of the native (1\u21923)-\u03b2-d-glucan improved the antitumor activity [210]. The extraction and purification of two novel water-soluble polysaccharides from fresh fruiting bodies of R. virescens were reported by the same research group. They revealed an interesting antioxidant properties [208]. Sun et al. [211] also isolated a water-soluble polysaccharide from the fruiting bodies of R. virescens, which had a backbone consisting of (1\u21926)-linked-\u03b1-d-galactopyranosyl and (1\u21922,6)-linked-\u03b1-d-galactopyranosyl residues that terminated in a single non-reducing terminal (1\u2192)-\u03b1-d-mannopyranosyl residue at the O-2 position of each (1\u21922,6)-linked-\u03b1-d-galactopyranosyl residues along the main chain in the ratio of 1:1:1. The polysaccharide exhibited a significant scavenging effects of hydroxyl radicals in vitro.

It is widely used in Asian medicine [216]. An investigation on a polysaccharide-enriched extract of S. imbricatus revealed that it stimulates the immune response in CTX-induced immunosuppressed mice via modulation of oxidative pathways [216]. An extract of S. imbricatus exhibited the growth of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria [22,217]. A Portugal research group reported that methanolic extracts of the mushroom showed potent antioxidant activity and antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus and Cryptococcus neoformans [218,219]. A new p-terphenyl, 2\u2032,3\u2032-diacetoxy-4,5,5\u2032,6\u2032,4\u2033,5\u2033-hexahydroxy-p-terphenyl (87), together with p-hydroxybenzoic acid, Bl-V (88), 2\u2032,3\u2032-diacetoxy-3,4,5\u2032,6\u2032,4\u2033-pentahydroxy-p-terphenyl, cerebroside E (89) (see structures 87\u221289 in Figure 17), nicotinic acid, 4-allylcatechol, uracil, ethyl \u03b2-d-glucopyranoside, propanetriol, uridine, adenosine and d-allitol were isolated from the fruiting bodies [220].

Heim, belonging to the family Lyophyllaceae is a very well-known wild edible mushroom, which is commonly distributed in Asia in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore [4,228]. It cannot be cultivated, because a symbiotic relationship with termites is necessary [229,230]. The mushroom has been reported to contain water-soluble polysaccharides with a great variety of biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, hypolipidemic activities [230,231,232,233,234]. In addition, T. albuminosus has been reported to contain many other bioactive components, such as chitin-glucan complex, alkaline protease, saponins, melanin, lipids and ergosterol; some of which possess analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities [235,236,237,238]. Mau et al. studied a methanolic extract of T. albuminosus mycelia, reporting an interesting reducing power, scavenging activity and chelating effects of ferrous ions. [239]. Qi, et al. described the chemical structures of six novel cerebrosides, named termitomycesphins A\u2013F (see structures 90\u201395 in Figure 18), together with known cerebroside 96, and reported their neuritogenic activities [240,241]. Other two new cerebrosides, named termitomycesphins G (97) and H (98) were later isolated from this mushroom by the same research group [242]. Four new selinane-type sesquiterpenoids, named teucdiol C-F (see structures 99\u2013102 in Figure 18), together with the known compounds teucdiol B (103) and epi-guaidiol A (104) were isolated by from a fermentation broth of T. albuminosus [243]; epi-guaidiol A (104) showed potent anti-acetylcholinesterase activity in a dose-dependent manner [243].",

On the other hand, a water-insoluble (1\u21923)-\u03b2-d-glucan was isolated from a hot alkaline extract of the mushroom collected in India [245]. The biological activity of a water-soluble polysaccharide-rich fraction of T. eurrhizus was investigated by an Indian research group. The fraction revealed healing properties against indomethacin-induced stomach ulceration in mice [246]. Pharmacological studies on mushroom polysaccharides have highlighted other biological properties such as anticarcinogenic, antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities etc. [21]; therefore, T. eurhizus deserves further in-depth pharmacological investigations.",

The lipid content of T. heimii was analyzed by Abd Malek\u2019s group who identified ergosterol and linoleic acid as the major components, and tetracosane, methyl palmitate, ethyl palmitate, methyl linoleate, ethyl linoleate, ethyl oleate, ethyl eicosanoate, ethyl tetracosanoate, ebericol, lanosterol, palmitic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid, neoergosterol, ergosta-5,8-dien-3-ol, ergosta-5,8(14)-dien-3-ol, 7-ergostenol, brassicasterol, \u03b3-ergostenol, myristic acid, linoleic acid, benzaldehyde, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, benzeneacetamide, cinnamic acid and nicotinamide as the minor components [249]. A polyphenol-rich fraction of T. heimii, collected in West Bengal, showed potent antioxidant activity [247].",

It widely grows in symbiosis with pine trees in China and the Greater Mekong region [260], where it is highly prized for its unique taste and flavor [260,261]. A novel ribonuclease, showing potent inhibitory activity toward HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, was isolated from dried fruiting bodies of the mushroom by Wang and Ng [262]. Two new polysaccharide fractions isolated from the fruiting bodies were characterized by Gong\u2019s group [263]. They exhibited strong inhibitory effects on HeLa cells and moderate inhibitory effect on \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase. Separation of an EtOAc-partitioned MeOH extract of T. ganbajun fruiting bodies collected in China afforded, in addition to 3-O-methylatromentin, five new poly(phenylacetyloxy)-substituted 1,1\u2032:4\u2032,1\u2033-terphenyl derivatives, called ganbajunins A\u2013E (see structures 105\u2013109 in Figure 19) [264]. Subsequently, ganbajunin F and G (see structures 110\u2013111 in Figure 19), together with cycloleucomelone were isolated from fresh fruiting bodies by the same research group [265]. The extracts obtained under optimized conditions by an ultrasonic-assisted extraction procedure, possessed significant antiproliferative activities towards human lung and liver cancer cells [266]. Moreover, ganbajunins A\u2013C (105\u2013107) and 3-O-methylatromentin possessed potent lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity, SOD activity in rat liver homogenate, and DPPH radical scavenging activity [261,267,268].",

A novel compound, named isodeoxyhelicobasidin (structure 112 in Figure 20), was isolated by a Korean research group from a culture broth of V. bombycine. Compound 112 was reported to possess human neutrophil elastase (HNE) activity with an IC50 value of 9.0 \u00b5m and antibacterial activity against several gram-positive bacteria, including S. aureus 503, methicillin-resistant S. aureus CCARM 3167 (MRSA), quinolone-resistant S. aureus CCARM 3505 (QRSA), Bacillus subtilis 1021, Staphylococcus epidermidis 3958 and Streptococcus mutans 3065, with MIC values in the range of 3.1\u201312.4 \u00b5g/mL [271]. Ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraene-3-one (113), ergosterol peroxide, indole-3-carboxaldehyde (114), and indazole (115) were later isolated from a culture broth of V. bombycine. Compound 113 showed inhibitory activity on melanogenesis with an IC50 = 80.9 \u00b5M and cytotoxic activity with an LD50 value of 50.6 \u03bcM [272].

However, regional biological resources are currently threatened by climatic changes and human activity-related factors such as the high rate of mining in the tropics, the construction of a great number of hydropower dams, and an indiscriminate consumption of plants in traditional medicines [274,275,276]. Therefore, access to biodiversity resources of Southeast Asia must be done paying great attention to their conservation or renovation. In this context, mushrooms play important roles in different ecosystems; however, they are often obtained in artificial cultures, thus avoiding the collection in the wild.",
