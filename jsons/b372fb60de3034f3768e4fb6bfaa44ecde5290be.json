We limited our measure of 29 epidemics growth rate to the first 5 days after reaching a minimum threshold of confirmed cases 30 (25, 50 or 100), as the mean incubation period of Covid-19 is ca. 5 days 8 and, immediately after the 31 first confirmed cases, many countries put in place unprecedented containment measures to mitigate 32 pathogen spread and community transmission 9 . Variation at these early epidemic growth rates 33 should best reflect the impact of local environmental conditions on disease spread. We restricted 34 analyses to data reported before March 19, as during that week many regions of the world adopted 35 stringent containment measures even in absence of large numbers of reported cases. For instance, 36 on March 17, 37 US states closed schools to prevent disease spread, including several states with 37 less than 25 confirmed Covid-19 cases 10 . We also considered additional factors that could affect 38 SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, such as human population density, government per-capita 39 health expenditure, and average air pollution levels (fine particulate matter; see Methods). 40 .

The management of Covid-19 outbreaks is undoubtedly one of the biggest challenges 74 governments will face in the coming months. Our spatially-explicit analysis suggests that, at least in 75 some parts of the world, ongoing containment efforts could benefit from the interplay between 76 pathogen spread and local climate. We do not claim that climate is the single major driver of Covid-77 19 spread. The huge variation of Covid-19 growth rates among regions with similar climate indeed 78 suggests that diverse and complex social and demographic factors, as well as stochasticity, may 79 strongly contribute to determine the severity of Covid-19 outbreaks. Yet, climate can contribute to 80 explain the variability in global patterns of Covid-19 growth rates.

To associate climate variables to the estimated r-values for each 154 country/region, we first extracted the mean month of the 5 days over which we computed the r-155 values (rounded to the nearest integer) (outbreak month).

Humidity, population density, health expenditure and 162 PM2.5 were log 10 -transformed to reduce skewness and improve normality of model residuals. 163 We adopted a model selection approach to identify the variables most likely to affect the 164 global variation of Covid-19 growth rate 22 . We built models representing the different 165 combinations of independent variables, and ranked them on the basis of Akaike's Information 166 Criterion (AIC). AIC trades-off explanatory power vs. number of predictors; parsimonious models 167 explaining more variation have the lowest AIC values and are considered to be the \"best models\" 22 . 168 For each candidate model, we calculated the Akaike weight \u03c9 i , representing the probability of the model given the data 169 23 . We then calculated the relative variable importance of each variable (RVI) as the sum of \u03c9 i of the models where 170 each variable is included. RVI can be interpreted the probability that a variable should be included in the best model 171 22,24 . Model selection analyses and the calculation of RVI can be heavily affected by collinearity among variables. In our 172 dataset, temperature and humidity showed a very strong positive correlation ( Fig. S1 and Table S7 ); furthermore, 173 population density was strongly positively associated with PM2.5 ( Figure S1 and Table S7 ). Therefore, temperature and 174 humidity, or population density and PM2.5, could not be considered together in the same models 24,25 . All other 175 predictors showed weak correlations and should not cause collinearity issues 25 (Table S7) . We therefore repeated the 176 model selection for different combinations of uncorrelated variables. First, we considered temperature, health 177 expenditure and population density as independent variables. Then we repeated the analysis using humidity instead of 178 temperature, and we calculated the RVI of variables separately for these two model selection analyses. Finally, to assess 179 the role of PM2.5, we repeated these two model selections analyses using PM2.5 instead of health expenditure. The",
