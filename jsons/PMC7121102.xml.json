This interaction is followed by a series of events that lead to the delivery of the viral genome inside the cytoplasm. Viruses can use diverse types of molecules to bind and enter cells. The presence of a receptor is the principal determinant of cell, tissue and organ tropism, host range, and virulence. Therefore, identifying a receptor can give clues on pathogenesis, mode of transmission, zoonotic transmission potential and can lead to the design of targeted intervention strategies.",

Coronaviruses infect a wide range of avian and mammalian hosts and they are known for their ability to cross the species barrier [1]. This is exemplified by the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic that was caused by the SARS-CoV [2]. In 2012, a novel zoonotic CoV was identified from a patient from Saudi Arabia that presented with a severe pneumonia [3]. This virus belongs to the same genus as SARS-CoV and was named Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).",

            "text": "Although virus receptors can be identified using several methods [4\u20138], we identified the MERS-CoV receptor using Fc-tagged S1 proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay followed by mass spectrometry [9]. This assay is basically similar to the method described by Li et al., for the identification of the SARS-CoV receptor [10]. In this assay, the S1 subunit of MERS-CoV is ligated into a fusion vector to generate an S1-Fc fusion protein, for expression in HEK-293T cells and purification using protein A-sepharose beads. Incubation of the S1-Fc proteins with whole cell lysate of virus-susceptible cells allows the precipitation of the virus receptor with the tagged S1. This complex can then be pulled down from the lysate using protein A-sepharose beads. Subsequently, mass spectrometry is employed to identify candidate protein receptors (Fig. 1). These candidates must be evaluated functionally, which is done using flow-cytometric binding assays, infection blocking experiments using antibodies against the candidate receptor, and finally by attempting to infect non-susceptible cells that have been transfected with the candidate receptor. This method has been successfully employed for the rapid identification of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV receptor [9, 10] and is suitable for identification of protein receptors with reasonable affinity. Glycan receptors cannot be identified using the described method; treatment of susceptible cells with glycosidases prior to infection can give an insight into the type of viral receptor. Success of the protein receptor pull-down using the S1-Fc as bait depends on the affinity of S1-receptor interaction. A FACS-based S1-Fc cell-binding assay provides good insight in the strength of this interaction. The FACS-based S1-Fc assay is also instrumental to identify cell lines with high levels of receptor expression that can be used as a source for receptor affinity-isolation. Alternatively, in the absence of a suitable cell line, homogenates of tissue targeted by the virus can also be used for immunoprecipitation of the receptor.\n",

The more the keratin contaminants, the less the protein identifications in the end.A few hours is sufficient.These steps can be skipped if you have alkylated the proteins before running the gel.\n",
