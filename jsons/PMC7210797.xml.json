In addition, BRCA genes increase the risk for pancreatic and prostate cancers (PCs). In fact, approximately 3% to 10% of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PA) have a family history of pancreatic cancer and approximately 10% to 20% of PAs are due to a genetic cause [7, 8]. Additionally, PC has some of the highest heritability of any cancer; Scandinavian studies estimate that up to 57% of the individual variation in risk is due to genetic factors [9, 10]. However, although the involvement of high-risk genes explains only a small proportion of hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) families, PVs in BRCA2 have been found in only 1.2% to 3.2% of patients with PC in most studies, whereas BRCA1 PVs are found in even smaller percentages [11\u201313].

In fact, over the past decade, multiple clinical studies have shown that patients harbouring gBRCA PVs are sensitive to PARPi and platinum-based chemotherapy and are associated with improved overall survival. As a result, gBRCA testing has become routine in the clinical management of ovarian and breast cancer patients [14, 15]. Additionally, more recently, PARPi is playing an increasingly important role in the care of patients with PA and PC; nowadays gBRCA testing is recommended for all patients with pancreatic or metastatic PC as well as patients with high Gleason grade PC [16, 17].",

At the same time, however, great attention has been paid to reach the right compromise between NGS costs and turnaround time for testing, guaranteeing, however, a high quality standard and reliability, mandatory for gBRCA testing in a clinical setting. In fact, identification of BRCA single nucleotide variants (SNVs) indels and copy number alteration (CNA) (where a minimum of samples is need to have reliable bioinformatics prediction [19]) was obtained.",
