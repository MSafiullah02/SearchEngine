Nevertheless, in these tables we have attempted to ascribe to each disease a measure of its importance (+ to + + + +), as viewed from the perspective of veterinary medicine in countries with modern agricultural practices. When considering diseases that have been eradicated from these countries, we have incorporated into our assessment the relative risk of these exotic diseases should they be reintroduced. For example, foot-and-mouth disease, which is given a + + + + rating in cattle, is an important disease even in countries in which it does not currently occur, because of its potential impact on beef exports and the rapidity with which this virus can spread from herd to herd. In contrast, rinderpest, though one of the most important diseases of ruminants in countries where it has not been eradicated, is given only a + + rating, because there is little chance of the virus being reintroduced in countries with modern veterinary services and, even if it were to be introduced in these countries, its eradication would present few difficulties. Had these tables been assembled from the perspective of the developing countries, then some diseases considered important in areas where intensive husbandry systems predominate would have been rated as inconsequential. For example, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis deserves a high rating in the intensive cattle production environment (dairy or beef) but is less important in developing countries.",

For example, most generalized skin diseases result from generalized, bloodborne infection, but they have been listed as skin diseases. Where viruses cause generalized signs and also signs of particular importance in some system, or in the newborn, they have been entered in both categories. The other headings in the tables have been selected to draw attention to the classification of the causal virus and its persistence, the geographical distribution of the disease, and the availability of vaccines.\n",
