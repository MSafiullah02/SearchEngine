The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), being part of southern China, which has enjoyed a relatively more advanced public health infrastructure and international connectivity, often became the first place where such emerging infectious diseases were discovered and from where they disseminated globally. The first such example occurred in 1894 when an outbreak of plague started in Canton (now the Guangdong Province) of China. A similar outbreak, this time an acute community-acquired atypical pneumonia syndrome, occurred in the Guangdong Province in late 2002. Retrospective investigations showed that severe cases of atypical pneumonia had been recorded in five cities around Guangzhou over a period of 2 months. The index case was reported on 16 November 2002 in Foshan, a city 24 km away from Guangzhou. The second case appeared in December 2002 when a chef from Heyuan who worked in a restaurant in Shenzhen was affected. He had an occupational history of regular contact with wild-game food animals. He transmitted the disease to his wife, two sisters, and seven hospital staff who had contact with him. From 16 November 2002 to 9 February 2003, 305 cases of atypical pneumonia were reported in mainland China with 105 of them being health care workers. The link between the outbreak in mainland China and the devastating epidemics in HKSAR and the rest of the world was a professor of nephrology from a teaching hospital in Guangzhou, China. He had contact with patients suffering from this unusual atypical pneumonia between 11 and 13 February 2003, then developed flu-like symptoms, including a fever and cough, before coming to Hong Kong. He arrived in Hong Kong on 21 February and within a day transmitted infection to 16 other people in the hotel that he stayed in. Thorough investigation of this patient failed to reveal any significant pathogens. One of the secondary cases, his brother-in-law who subsequently became infected, underwent an open lung biopsy that was pivotal in the discovery of the etiology this disease. The virus was a novel coronavirus, subsequently called the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Sequence of Events"}, {"text": "Infected contacts in the hotels unknowingly carried the disease to other hospitals in the HKSAR and to other countries and continents including Vietnam, Canada, Singapore, the Philippines, the United Kingdom, the United States, and back again to China. Dr. Carlo Urbani, a physician stationed at the World Health Organization (WHO) office in Hanoi, was the first to notify the WHO of the occurrence of this disease outside Guangdong after witnessing an explosive nosocomial outbreak in a hospital in Hanoi. The index case of this outbreak was one of those who acquired infection on 21-22 February in the hotel in Hong Kong. The WHO named this \"atypical pneumonia\" as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Dr Urbani's description of the disease, to which he later succumbed, alerted health authorities throughout the world and started an unprecedented collaboration of 11 research laboratories in 9 countries to identify the etiological agent responsible.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Sequence of Events"}, {"text": "SARS is essentially an acute community-acquired or nosocomial pneumonia that does not respond to conventional antimicrobial therapy for known pneumonia pathogens. As of mid-2003, 8096 cases with 774 deaths occurred on five continents (World Health Organization, 2003a) . Interpersonal transmission has occurred in health care facilities, workplaces, homes, and public transports (World Health Organization, 2003b) . From September 2003 to May 2004, three laboratory-associated outbreaks were reported Orellana, 2004) . The laboratoryacquired cases in Singapore and Taiwan were each limited to one affected person, whereas that in Beijing was associated with secondary and tertiary cases (World Health Organization, 2004) . SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is most likely zoonotic in origin and then transmitted to humans. The virus may have been circulating among wild game animals in the wet markets of southern China. The palm civet is now considered to be the most likely amplification host and one of the likely candidates for introduction to humans . A seroprevalence of about 80% was recently reported for civets in animal markets in Guangzhou (Tu et al., 2004) . The initial human cases of the 2003 pandemic and those of the 2004 Guangdong outbreak were epidemiologically linked to game animals either because of occupational contact or eating . The most important route of interpersonal spread appears to be direct or indirect contact of the mucosae with infectious respiratory droplets or fomites (World Health Organization, 2003b) . SARS-CoV has been detected in respiratory secretions, feces, urine, and tears Loon et al., 2004) . Nosocomial transmission of SARS could be facilitated by the use of nebulizers, suction, intubation, bronchoscopy, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation on SARS patients by generation of large numbers of infectious droplets Varia et al., 2003; World Health Organization 2003b; Christian et al., 2004) . Almost half of the SARS cases in Hong Kong acquired the infection within health care facilities and institutions (Leung et al., 2004a) . The overall attack rate among hospital workers is 1.2% and the attack rate was correlated with the number of SARS patients admitted (Lau et al., 2004c) . Airborne transmission is considered uncommon given the relatively low attack rates. A unique form of airborne transmission was considered the likely explanation for a large community outbreak in a private housing estate: Negative pressure generated by exhaust fans coupled with dry U traps of sewage drains was thought to facilitate the dissemination of contaminated aerosols between toilets. It is suggested that the plume of contaminated warm air along the light well was then carried by wind to other blocks of the housing complex . The finding of culturable viruses in stool and the high fecal viral load shown by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Peiris et al., 2003a) suggested the possibility of fecal-oral transmission though this has not been proved conclusively.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 234, "end": 268, "text": "(World Health Organization, 2003a)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 379, "end": 413, "text": "(World Health Organization, 2003b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 501, "end": 516, "text": "Orellana, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 687, "end": 720, "text": "(World Health Organization, 2004)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1145, "end": 1162, "text": "(Tu et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}, {"start": 1501, "end": 1535, "text": "(World Health Organization, 2003b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1616, "end": 1634, "text": "Loon et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 1855, "end": 1874, "text": "Varia et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF141"}, {"start": 1875, "end": 1907, "text": "World Health Organization 2003b;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1908, "end": 1931, "text": "Christian et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2047, "end": 2068, "text": "(Leung et al., 2004a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 2203, "end": 2222, "text": "(Lau et al., 2004c)", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 2913, "end": 2935, "text": "(Peiris et al., 2003a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Epidemiologic Characteristics"}, {"text": "The incubation period is estimated to be 2 to 14 days.

Most of the transmissions resulted from contacts with patients with overt disease rather than asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases.

Primary viral isolation can be achieved by inoculating embryonal monkey cell lines such as Vero E6 and FRhK-4 cells. Subcultures can be made on other Vero cells, Huh-7 (a liver cancer cell line; Simmons et al., 2004) and CACO-2 (a colonic carcinoma cell line), and two pig cell lines (POEK, PS) (Hattermann et al., 2005) . In contrast with other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV can be maintained in cell culture easily and it produces obvious cytopathetic effects in Vero E6 within 48 h. SARS-CoV has a higher degree of stability in the environment as compared with other known human coronaviruses World Health Organization 2003c; Rabenau et al., 2005) : it survives for at least 2 to 3 days on dry surfaces at room temperature and 2 to 4 days in stool (Rabeneu et al., 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 297, "end": 318, "text": "Ksiazek et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 319, "end": 340, "text": "Peiris et al., 2003b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 538, "end": 559, "text": "Simmons et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 638, "end": 663, "text": "(Hattermann et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 939, "end": 971, "text": "World Health Organization 2003c;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 972, "end": 993, "text": "Rabenau et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 1094, "end": 1116, "text": "(Rabeneu et al., 2005)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 154, "end": 162, "text": "(Table 5", "ref_id": null}], "section": "General Virology"}, {"text": "Electron microscopy appearance and genome order ( Fig. 5 .1) of 5\u2032replicase-structural (spike-envelope-membrane-nucleocapsid)-polyT-3\u2032 on complete genomic sequencing are similar to other members of Coronaviridae. SARS-CoV is phylogenetically distinct from any of the three groups of known coronaviruses. Human coronaviruses 229E and NL63 belong to group 1 van der Hoek et al., 2004) ; human coronavirus OC43 belongs to group 2, and group 3 consists of all the avian coronaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the spike protein of 139 SARS-CoV isolates in the Hong Kong outbreak showed that several introductions had occurred but only one of them was associated with the major outbreak in Hong Kong and the rest of the world . Some of the strains found in the early stages of the outbreak were phylogenetically distinct from the major cluster and were closer to some of the Guangdong and Beijing strains. This concurred with the fact that the index patient of the Hong Kong outbreak was a Guangzhou medical doctor who had traveled to Hong Kong. Another molecular epidemiological study of a Guangdong outbreak suggested that the disease spread from Guangdong to Hong Kong and the rest of the world, and the index case was a chef who handled game animals . Subsequent animal surveillance in China recovered coronavirus isolates that have a nucleotide homology of 99.8% with the SARS-CoV . A characteristic 29-base insertion between open reading frames (ORF) 10 to 11 (also named as ORF8a and 8b) was found in these animal isolates Snijder et al., 2003) . This 29-nucleotide segment was deleted after or before crossing the species barrier to humans. The biological effect of this deletion remains elusive. A number of SARS-CoV in the later stages of the epidemic showed larger deletions around this site (The Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004). Two independent molecular epidemiological studies comparing the complete genome of 12 and 63 virus isolates also found evidence of a strong positive selection at the beginning of the epidemic that is followed by a purifying selection, as indicated by the amino acid substitution rate at the spike, Orf3a, and nsp3 (The Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004; Yeh et al., 2004; Song et al., 2005) . Both studies suggested that molecular adaptation of the virus had occurred after interspecies transmission from animals to humans. In the small outbreak of Guangzhou in 2004, all four human isolates belonged to a separate sublineage with the concurrent animal, predominantly civet cat, isolates that are distinct from the human pandemic or animal virus of the 2003. Though the SARS-CoV is distinct from the three existing groups of coronaviruses, it may be closer to group 2 because 19 out of 20 cysteines found in the S1 domain of the spike protein are spatially conserved when compared with the group 2 consensus sequence, whereas only 5 cysteine residues are conserved when compared with that of the groups 1 and 3 Snijder et al., 2003) . Because coronaviruses are believed to have co-evolved with their animal hosts, it was possible that rats, mice, and cattle harboring group 2 coronaviruses are more likely to be the animal host for SARS-CoV than cats, which harbor group 1 coronavirus. However when a comparison of the phylogenetic trees for 11 known host-species and nucleocapsid sequences of 36 coronaviruses was done using an interference approach with sliding window analysis, there is statistical incongruence that indicates multiple host-species shifts between the coronaviruses of many animals that are phylogenetically distant (Rest and Mindell, 2003) . Thus, even if the civet cats or other related mammals are the true animal reservoir rather than mice and rats, it would not be too big a surprise. Moreover, the civet cats and other related mammals had at least served as a major amplification mechanism in the markets of southern China irrespective of the original animal reservoir. The control of these animals and the markets plays a pivotal role in the epidemiological control of SARS. Genomic evidence of another animal-to-human interspecies transmission events was demonstrated in a small outbreak of four cases in early 2004 in Guangzhou (Song et al., 2005) . A metalloprotease angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) from Vero E6 cells was found to bind the S1 domain of the spike protein of the SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2003c) . The 293T cells transfected with ACE2 can form multinucleated syncytia with cells expressing the spike. ACE2 expression is detected by immunohistochemical staining on enterocytes, pneumocytes, vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Hamming et al., 2004) . This is compatible with the clinical and histopathological manifestations of SARS, which include diffuse alveolar damage, colonic mucosal presence of abundant viral particles in a patient with diarrhea, and pulmonary vasculitis and thrombosis. The lack of virus infection in some cell lines that express ACE2 has led to a rush for finding coreceptors for cell entry . Recently, a C-type lectin called L-SIGN was shown to be an alternative receptor for binding and cell entry (Jeffers et al., 2004) , although it is not clear whether this is a functional receptor for the virus that can lead to productive virus replication. Murine ACE2 binds less efficiently with the S1 domain of SARS-CoV, and even less well with rat ACE2, which suggests that efficient replication in the mouse or rat is limited by their ACE2 type (Greenough et al., 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 356, "end": 382, "text": "van der Hoek et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF140"}, {"start": 1525, "end": 1546, "text": "Snijder et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 2213, "end": 2230, "text": "Consortium, 2004;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2231, "end": 2248, "text": "Yeh et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF172"}, {"start": 2249, "end": 2267, "text": "Song et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 2988, "end": 3009, "text": "Snijder et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 3612, "end": 3636, "text": "(Rest and Mindell, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}, {"start": 4233, "end": 4252, "text": "(Song et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 4400, "end": 4418, "text": "(Li et al., 2003c)", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 4659, "end": 4680, "text": "Hamming et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 5158, "end": 5180, "text": "(Jeffers et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 5500, "end": 5524, "text": "(Greenough et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 50, "end": 56, "text": "Fig. 5", "ref_id": null}], "section": "General Virology"}, {"text": "Pseudotyped retroviral vector carrying the S, M, or E proteins revealed that the S protein is both necessary and sufficient for virus attachment on susceptible cells (Simmons et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2004a) .

Etiological diagnosis and differentiation from other causes of atypical pneumonia can only be made by laboratory confirmation. A positive viral culture from the respiratory, fecal, and occasionally urine specimens, a fourfold rise of neutralizing antibody titer in the serum taken on admission and 28 days afterwards are the most definitive evidence of infection. Of these methods, real-time quantitative RT-PCR of the nasopharyngeal aspirate is most practicable in aiding clinical diagnosis and can achieve a sensitivity of 80% with good specificity if it is collected within the first 3 days of illness . For antibody testing, the indirect immunofluorescent antibody test is more commonly performed than the neutralizing antibody test since the former does not involve manipulation of infectious virus and therefore carries less biohazard risk. Recombinant nucleocapsid enzyme immunoassay (EIA) can be used as a rapid screening test and possesses high sensitivity as early as 5 days after onset of illness (Che, 2004) .

Immunohistochemical staining showed the presence of viral proteins in pneumocytes and occasional macrophages. Necrosis or atrophy in the lymphoid tissue of lymph nodes and white pulp of the spleen is a commonly observed extrapulmonary pathology. Flow cytometry examination of the peripheral blood at the time of admission before the use of steroid had shown decreases in levels of dendritic cell subsets, natural killer cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes (Cui et al., 2003; Li et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2004b) .

Study of the cytokine profile of SARS patients showed significant elevation of the plasma chemokines interleukin (IL)-8, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), and interferon-gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), Th1-related cytokine interferon-gamma and IL-12, and inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, which can induce an intense inflammatory response (Jones et al., 2004; Huang et al., 2005; Jiang et al., 2005) . This may account for the recruitment and accumulation of alveolar macrophages and polymorphs and the activation of Th1 cell-mediated immunity by the stimulation of natural killer and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In contrast, SARS-CoV appears to evade triggering an alpha and beta interferon response in human macrophages . The lack of this antiviral innate immune response may permit uncontrolled viral replication with progressive increase in viral load continuing into the second week of illness until the appearance of the adaptive immune response brings the virus replication under control. Moreover, comparative transcriptomal microarray analysis showed that the SARS-CoV rather than the HCoV-229E markedly upregulates genes associated with apoptosis, inflammation, stress response, and procoagulation during the early phase of infection of a human liver cancer cell line (Huh7).

No significant adverse reactions were noted, although this did not appear to be beneficial, either. Currently, only hyperimmune globulin produced from convalescent patients' plasma and the equine plasma immunized by inactivated SARS-CoV are available for prophylactic trials in human. A human monoclonal IgG1 produced from a single-chain variable region fragment against the S1 domain from two nonimmune human antibody libraries has also been produced (Sui et al., 2004) . One of the single-chain variable region fragments 80R blocks the spike-ACE2 receptor interaction through binding to the S1 domain. In a murine model of asymptomatic SARS infection, passive immunization by high titers of neutralizing antibody prevented virus replication in the lungs but not as effectively in the nasal turbinates . Similarly, passive immunization of mice and ferrets with a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody CR3014 was effective in preventing the development of lung pathology but less effective in reducing pharyngeal excretion . Currently, there are no randomized placebo control trials on the role of antibody therapy for pre-or postexposure prophylaxis in at-risk groups during the SARS epidemic. Retrospective analysis of outcome in a human study using SARS convalescent plasma suggested that passive immunization had no major side effects and perhaps some clinical benefits (Soo et al., 2004 ). It appears that the antibody response against the viral spike antigen is the key factor for protection against infection. Similar findings were found in the murine model using either intramuscular or intranasal administration of the highly attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara carrying the spike protein (Bisht et al., 2004) . Mucosal immunization of African green monkeys with the recombinant attenuated parainfluenza virus-SARS-CoV spike protein chimeric virus resulted in a good neutralizing antibody response and protection from viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts after live SARS-CoV challenge . Other approaches to active immunization involved the use of an adenoviral vector (carrying S, M, and N proteins) in rhesus macaques , inactivated whole virus vaccine in mice , S protein fragments in rabbits and mice (Zhang et al., 2004c) , DNA vaccination with the nucleocapsid gene in mice (Zhu et al., 2004b) ; adenoviral vector carrying the S1 domain, membrane and nucleoprotein or a DNA vaccine linking nucleocapsid protein to calreticulin (Kim et al., 2004) . A plasmid DNA vaccine carrying the spike protein encoded by humanized codons was highly protective in a mouse model . Furthermore, T-cell depletion with specific monoclonal antibodies against CD4 or CD8, alone or in combination with CD90 did not affect the protective immunity, which was confirmed by adoptive T-cell transfer. Donor T cells alone did not inhibit pulmonary viral replication in recipient mice, whereas passive transfer of purified IgG from immunized mice achieved similar protection.
