To disentangle the role of animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission, we present a model of spillover exposure and onwards human-to-human transmission in which human cases on a given day can arise from exposure to animals or as a result of earlier human cases. We do not assume that the temporal pattern of exposure to animals (the spillover hazard) is known and we jointly estimate spillover exposure and the human-to-human R0. Using simulated data, we first examine the feasibility of obtaining robust estimates of R0 from reported (human) cases. We then apply the method to real case data, estimating the value of R0 in the three largest outbreaks reported for influenza A/H7N9 from China: Shanghai (33 cases), Zhejiang (46 cases) and Jiangsu (27 cases).",

Cases could also arise from human-to-human transmission: we assumed infected individuals had an infectiousness profile described by a Poisson distribution with mean \u03bb, the serial interval of the disease. The number of new infections generated by each infectious individual depended on R0 and, because there were few total infections relative to the population size, we assumed no saturation effects: depletion of the susceptible pool did not affect the dynamics.

In Hangzhou LBMs were closed on April 15th and in Huzhou LBMs were closed around April 10th.

Ideally, we would be able to measure \u2013 via virological market surveillance or otherwise \u2013 the change in the relative spillover hazard over time, leaving just two unknowns: R0 and the absolute magnitude of the spillover hazard. Fig. 1B shows that if we assumed the amplitudes and timings of the steps in the spillover hazard were known, our estimates of R0 were tightly constrained around the true value (Fig. 1E). With current surveillance practices it is likely that far less about the spillover hazard will be known. However, if the risk of transmission from animals is decreased by culling or market closure, this date is often reported12. Therefore we modelled a known drop in spillover hazard date (\u00b17 days), but with nothing else known about the shape or magnitude of the hazard (Fig. 1C). Even in this scenario, we obtained unbiased estimates of R0, although the posterior distributions had higher variance than before (Fig. 1F). In contrast, if we had no information whatsoever about the shape and magnitude of the spillover hazard, we obtained a diffuse posterior distribution, with an apparently biased median value for R0 (Fig. 1D).",

First we calibrated the animal exposure portion of the model in the absence of human-to-human transmission, setting R0=0 and estimating a stepwise hazard with arbitrarily many steps. This framework contains the saturated likelihood model: with a step for every day, we obtain the highest possible probability for the data. However, only a few steps were required for a parsimonious model of animal-to-human-only infections: using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), we see that the models with three or four steps have substantially more support than other hazard functions across Shanghai, Zhejiang and Jiangsu (Table 1). Therefore we used a three step function in the rest of our analysis. Next, we added human-to-human transmission to the spillover model with a three step hazard function and known date for a decrease in hazard (in this instance, the market closure date). Based on cluster data available at the time of the outbreak13, we first assumed \u03bb=9.6 days. Table 1 shows that the model with human-to-human transmission had more support than the animal-to-human-only model for Shanghai and Jiangsu, with both models having similar support for Zhejiang.",

This contrasts with the five potential cases of human-to human-transmission reported out of a total of 136 cases23\n,\n24, suggesting that a greater number of human-to-human cases may have been confirmed if additional data on each case\u2019s potential for exposure had been available.

It could be that changes in behaviour \u2013 perhaps as a reaction to mass media reports \u2013 reduced transmission by the time the Zhejiang outbreak started.

Second, the results illustrate how being able to characterise the variation in spillover hazard over time can permit accurate estimates of R0 from relatively small outbreaks. For example, to characterise the hazard from avian influenza in poultry markets, weekly random samples could be taken and stored from sentinel markets. In the event of a nearby outbreak of human cases, stored samples could be tested and the temporal variation in spillover risk estimated independent of the incidence of human cases. If this approach were combined with routine sequencing of human isolates, it is possible that fitness increases in the virus could be observed prior to the virus crossing the critical threshold of R0 equal to one.",
