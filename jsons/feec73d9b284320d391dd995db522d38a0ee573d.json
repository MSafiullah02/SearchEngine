No reuse allowed without permission. : medRxiv preprint 2 The coronavirus disease 2019 has resulted in high morbidity and mortality 20 worldwide since December 2019. Recent studies showed that patients with previous heart 21 disease, especially heart failure (HF), whose plasma Natriuretic Peptides (NPs) concentrations 22 are higher, were more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we retrospectively 23 analyzed single-center case series of 91 patients with COVID-19 in China. 46 (50.5%) patients 24 exhibited cardiac dysfunction as indicated by elevated Natriuretic Peptides B (BNP) levels. 25 Moreover, the results indicate that patients with cardiac dysfunction had higher mortality than 26 those without cardiac dysfunction. Nonetheless, it remains unclear as to how the virus infects 27 the heart, especially in HF patients and why a higher level of BNP in the heart dampen 28 inflammation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the critical host cellular receptor of 29 SARS-CoV-2, expresses in different organs. Still, its cellular distribution in the human heart, 30 especially in patients with HF remains unclear. Thus, we investigated ACE2 gene expression 31 pattern in single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) data of hearts from normal adults versus 32 patients with HF. Our results indicate that ACE2 is predominantly enriched in cardiomyocytes 33 (CMs), endothelial cells, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells in normal heart. Not only ACE2+ 34 CMs, but also expression of ACE2 are significantly boosted in CMs of patients with HF. Also, 35 genes related to virus entry, virus replication and suppression of IFN-\u03b3 signaling besides ACE2 36 were up-regulated in HF patient, mainly in CMs, indicating the higher susceptibility to SARS-37",

ACE2 functions 63 to convert angiotensin II (Ang II) into angiotensin1-7 (Ang1-7) thus preserving ejection 64 fraction in patients with HF 13 . As such, patients with underlying cardiovascular disorders such 65 as HF are more susceptible to be infected by the virus and their mortality rates are higher than 66 compared to normal patients resulting from increased ACE2 14 . Nonetheless, at the single cell 67 level, nothing much is known about the underlying mechanism as to why the failing heart is 68 more vulnerable to the virus compared with a normal heart. 69 Our present study retrospectively analyzed a single-center case series in Ezhou, China. The 70 results show that cardiac dysfunction(BNP\u2265100 pg/mL)in patients infected with SARS-CoV-71 2 is associated with higher mortality.

Drug ACEI 456 or ARBs can break this positive feedback loop by reducing Ang II. They maybe benefit from 457 these kinds of drugs, including ACEI, ARBs and LCZ696/Entresto.

This study was approved by the National Health Commission of China and Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine (Shanghai, China). Written informed consent was waived by the ethics committee of the designated hospital for patients with emerging infectious diseases.Data CollectionThe demographic characteristics, clinical data (comorbidities, laboratory findings, and outcomes), laboratory findings for participants during hospitalization were collected from electronic medical records. Cardiac biomarkers measured on admission were collected, including TNI, CK-MB, and BNP. All data were independently reviewed and entered the computer database by three analysts. Patients were categorized according to the BNP. Acute heart failure (HF) was defined as blood levels of BNP above 100 pg/ml, regardless of cardiovascular disease history and new abnormalities in electrocardiography and 100 echocardiography. The clinical outcomes (i.e., discharges and mortality) were monitored up to March 15, 2020.PCR-Fluorescence probing based kit ( Novel Coronavirus(2019-nCoV) Nucleic Acid Diagnostic Kit, Sansure Biotech, China) was used to extract nucleic acids from clinical sample All rights reserved.
