The mode of transmission of infection appears to be through large droplets, aerosols, fomites, or person-to-person contact.() Infected subjects are known to release a wide size range of particles during breathing, coughing, sneezing, and talking. The droplets travel some distance and evaporate to form smaller-size particles. Normal human subjects and infected individuals release considerable numbers of submicron diameter particles in the exhaled breath.(\u2013) In one study, exhaled breath of seven subjects infected with influenza was collected on Teflon filters and exhaled particle concentrations measured using an optical particle counter.() Filters were tested for influenza virus by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Results for four subjects showed influenza virus particles in exhaled breath and over 87% of particles were under 1 \u03bcm in diameter. Recently, appreciable numbers of influenza particles were found in the ambient air in different locations.() Submicron aerosols can remain airborne for prolonged periods because of their low settling velocity. Infectious aerosol, when inhaled by susceptible persons, is likely to cause disease.",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed recommendations on the use of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and facemasks for protection against pandemic influenza virus transmission for home, community, and occupational settings.() SMs are used as barriers to limit the dissemination of secretions or large droplets from patient to others. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clears the SMs for sale, based on the test report provided by the manufacturers. SMs are confused with respirators because both look similar and are worn on the face. In general, the filter efficiency of N95 FFRs is superior to SMs.(,) Filter efficiency is enhanced by electrostatic charge on filter media of N95 FFRs. The most penetrating particle size (MPPS) for N95 FFRs is \u223c50 nm (electrical mobility diameter).() In the case of SMs, both electrostatic as well as mechanical (MPPS >100 nm) types are available.() FFRs are fit-tested before use in workplaces whereas SMs are not. SMs were used for respiratory protection in health care facilities when there was a shortage of respirators during pandemic seasons.() Therefore, knowing the effectiveness of SMs against infectious bioaerosols is of public health importance.",

To address this issue, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommended further research in key areas including the effectiveness of facemasks and respirators against infectious particles and faceseal leakage contributing to the overall total inward leakage (TIL).() TIL is defined as an inverse function of a protection level offered by a respirator when the contributions of aerosol penetration through filter media, faceseal leakage, and leakage through other components are considered. It is known that FFRs are designed to provide good fitting on the human face unlike the SMs. Because of the difference in face-fitting characteristics, SMs will have a larger faceseal leakage than FFRs when used by workers.

A FFR or SM was sealed to a manikin head form using a silicone sealant and placed inside a test chamber (48 \u00d7 48 \u00d7 48 cm3). The head form was connected to a breathing simulator (Breathing Simulator Series 1101, Hans Rudolph, Inc., Shawnee, Kans.) through an isolation chamber consisting of a rubber bladder inside an airtight glass container. A metal tube (2.5 cm diameter) from the back of the mouth was connected to an inflatable rubber bladder, which mimics a human lung, inside the glass container connected to a breathing simulator. The breathing simulator allows air to go back and forth into the glass container. In response, ambient air enters the bladder through the FFR sealed to the manikin head form during inhalation and exits during exhalation. Thus, the isolation chamber prevented particles created by the breathing simulator pump from getting inside the breathing zone of the respirator. The breathing simulator allowed for several parameters to be varied including tidal volume and breathing rate, which provided simulation of more realistic breathing conditions.\n\n",

Excess aerosol exited through a hole (1.3 cm diameter) in the back of the test chamber. A small fan was installed at the bottom of the chamber to ensure an even distribution of particles throughout. Aerosol samples from the test chamber were analyzed for number concentration for different size monodisperse particles (20\u2013800 nm, electrical mobility diameter) over 240 sec and repeated after a 30 sec interval, using a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) (TSI model 3080) with a long differential mobility analyzer (DMA), and an ultra-fine condensation particle counter (UCPC, TSI 3776). The DMA separates particles based on their electrical mobility. The count median diameter (CMD) and mode size (peak size) of the test aerosols were obtained from the SMPS scans.",

Another limitation of the study is the TIL measurement for particles below 800 nm size range. TIL study for a wide size range of airborne particles using additional equipment may provide more realistic information. Nevertheless, the measurement for 20\u2013800 nm size range provides the underlying mechanism of regulation of TIL by filter penetration and faceseal leakage processes.

Leakage of test aerosols through artificial holes increased the TIL for different size particles while the MPPS remained at the same sizes obtained at sealed condition with no artificial leaks, showing that filter penetration regulates TIL. In general, higher-efficiency N95 and SM models showed lower TIL values than the lower-efficiency models, indicating the potential influence of filter efficiency. TIL results obtained in the study indicate that faceseal leakage allows all the different diameter size test aerosols to enter and exit the filtering device while filter penetration assigns the TIL for different size particles. Overall, the data suggest that higher-efficiency N95 FFRs with good fitting characteristics would provide higher protection against submicron-size bioaerosols.",
