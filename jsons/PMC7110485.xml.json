Most ferrets seen in clinical practice have been de-scented and neutered, which reduces but does not totally eliminate this musky scent. This scent is much more pungent in the intact ferret, particularly the intact male.",

In the United Kingdom and Canada, ferrets are generally outdoor pets used for hunting rabbits, groundhogs, and other small mammals. Their long, skinny shape allows ferrets to follow prey down into burrows and flush them out so they may be captured with nets or snares. Ferrets are popular indoor pets in the United States. Most American ferrets come from large ferret farms or ranches where they are neutered and de-scented at an early age. Despite their domesticity and popularity, ferrets are poorly understood. There are many state, county, or city laws that describe them as \u201cwild,\u201d \u201cnon-domestic,\u201d or \u201cdangerous\u201d animals [2].",

Avoid high-dose ketamine in ferrets that have urethral obstruction. Most ferrets should be intubated and maintained on isoflurane or sevoflurane when anesthetized for extended periods. Using a 24-gauge catheter with the needle removed may be helpful in finding and dilating the urethral opening. Afterward, a 3-Fr 11-in ferret urinary catheter (Slippery Sam, Global Veterinary Products; New Buffalo, MI) or a 22- or 20-gauge jugular catheter may be placed in most ferrets (\nFig. 5). Use a 3.5-Fr red rubber catheter in larger males. Pre-measure the length of red rubber or jugular catheters. Keeping red rubber catheters in the freezer until time of placement may enhance ease of insertion. Leaving the jugular catheter stylet in place may also facilitate careful passage.

Common emergency conditions seen in the ferret include insulinoma, cardiomyopathy, and urethral obstruction. When developing a diagnostic and therapeutic plan, the ferret veterinarian must seek a balance between species-specific information discussed in this article and information extrapolated from cat and dog medicine.
