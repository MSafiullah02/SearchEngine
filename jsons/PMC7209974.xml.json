Emerging evidence suggests the progression of COVID-19 is characterized by two possibly overlapping phases. During the early phase, host viral load is high, and even in the presence of pneumonia, systemic damage is limited. In the later phase, viral load decreases, but elevated cytokine levels and a hyper-inflammatory response are accompanied by damage to other organs [3].",

The authors compared nasopharyngeal swab viral loads over 6 days in 20 patients treated with HCQ sulfate (200 mg TID for 10 days) and in 16 patients who refused or had contraindication to treatment [7]. The clinical severity of the patients ranged between asymptomatic and pneumonia, but none was critical. On the sixth day, less patients had a detectable viral load in the HCQ group and the effect seemed more evident in the six patients who received azithromycin in addition to HCQ. The small number of participants (n = 36), lack of control for confounders, brief follow-up, and substantial loss to follow-up among those treated (23%, 6/26) limit the validity of these findings. The authors also did not use an intention-to-treat analysis, although they did declare the reasons for patient dropouts. Finally, the indications for combined HCQ-azithromycin treatment were not described. On April 3, the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (ISAC) declared that \u201cThe ISAC Board believes the article does not meet the Society\u2019s expected standard, especially relating to the lack of better explanations of the inclusion criteria and the triage of patients to ensure patient safety.\u201d highlighting that \u201cthe need for fast release of new data should not reduce the quality of scientific scrutiny\u201d [8].",
