Within a few days, the same virus was detected in a Qatari patient receiving intensive care in a London hospital, a situation reminiscent of the role air travel played in the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002. SARS-CoV originated in China's Guangdong Province and affected more than 8000 patients in 26 countries before it was contained 6 months later. Over a year after the emergence of this novel coronavirus -Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)it has caused 178 laboratory-confirmed cases and 76 deaths. The emergence of a second highly pathogenic coronavirus within a decade highlights the importance of a coordinated global response incorporating reservoir surveillance, high-containment capacity with fundamental and applied research programs, and dependable communication pathways to ensure outbreak containment. Here, we review the current state of knowledge on the epidemiology, ecology, molecular biology, clinical features, and intervention strategies of the novel coronavirus, MERS-CoV.",

In addition, there have been two zoonotic introductions of coronaviruses into the human population over the last decade, both associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and high case fatality rates: severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV; Drosten et al., 2003; Kuiken et al., 2003) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV; Zaki et al., 2012) . SARS-CoV caused the first pandemic of the 21st century, resulting in c. 8400 human cases and an 11% case fatality rate (SARS Epidemiology Working Group, 2003) . In addition to the impact of SARS-CoV on infected individuals and the global public health community, the economic cost of the SARS-CoV outbreak event was estimated at $16 billion (Brahmbhatt & Dutta, 2008) . Although only 163 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV are currently reported, the high case fatality rate and travel-related spread across multiple countries are reminiscent of the SARS-CoV pandemic.",

MERS -CoV-specific quantitative RT-PCRs (qRT-PCR), targeting the region upstream of the E protein gene and the open reading frame 1b, were rapidly developed and have become standards in the laboratory testing and diagnosis of MERS-CoV (Corman et al., 2012a) . Additional qRT-PCRs targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and nucleocapsid (N) genes have been developed as confirmatory assays (Corman et al., 2012b) . The World Health Organization (WHO) case definition for MERS-CoV focuses on patients suffering febrile acute respiratory disease who have a direct epidemiological link to another confirmed case or are residents of or travelers to MERS-CoV-source countries (WHO, 2013c) . Confirmatory laboratory testing requires a positive qRT-PCR of at least two specific genomic targets or a single positive target by qRT-PCR combined with sequencing of a second target (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013) . In instances of inadequate testing or negative tests, a patient with a direct epidemiologic link to a confirmed MERS-CoV case is determined to be a probable case of MERS-CoV infection if they present with acute febrile respiratory illness.",

            "text": "As of January 20, 2014, there were 178 confirmed cases of MERS-CoV, 76 (43%) of which were fatal (Fig. 3) . Although most cases have been clinically severe, contact surveillance has uncovered at least 27 subclinical or mild infections (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013). The case fatality ratio of MERS-CoV (43%) is much higher than that of SARS-CoV (CFR 11%) (SARS Epidemiology Working Group, 2003) . The average age of Fig. 1 False-color MERS-CoV particle visualized by electron microscopy. A MERS-CoV particle (yellow) attached to the surface of a cell (red). The characteristic MERS-CoV spike glycoproteins are clearly visible on the surface of the MERS-CoV particle. MERS-CoV cases is 52 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.6-1 (The WHO MERS-CoV Research Group, 2013) . Both the case fatality ratio and the male-to-female ratio have decreased as the incidence of MERS-CoV has increased, changes that may be attributed to improved case surveillance (Penttinen et al., 2013) . Interestingly, over three quarters of MERS-CoV cases have occurred in patients with comorbidities (The WHO MERS-CoV Research Group, 2013) . The most common comorbidities for MERS-CoV cases have been diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cancer, and chronic kidney, heart, and lung disease . While these comorbidities likely affect disease progression and outcome, the strong correlation of chronic disease and MERS-CoV may be biased by the high rate of these risk factors in the populations of the affected countries. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, for instance, the prevalence of type-II diabetes across ages is 31.6%, the prevalence of obesity is 31.1% (Al-Daghri et al., 2011) , and one quarter of adult males smoke (WHO, 2013a). Epidemiologic and pathogenesis studies will be necessary to discern how comorbidities impact susceptibility to, and progression of, MERS-CoV infection.",

Anecdotal evidence of MERS-CoV patient contact with farm animals has been reported in a few cases (Albarrak et al., 2012; Buchholz et al., 2013; Drosten et al., 2013; The WHO MERS-CoV Research Group, 2013) , and so suspicions about the potential source of MERS-CoV have focused on livestock common to the Arabian Peninsula, such as goats, sheep, dromedary camels, and cows. The first evidence for the existence of an intermediate animal reservoir was the detection of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in dromedary camels from Oman and the Canary Islands (Spain) (Reusken et al., 2013b) . Subsequent studies have detected MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in dromedary camels from Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and importantly, in camel serum collected in 2003 from the United Arab Emirates (Hemida et al., 2013; Perera et al., 2013; Reusken et al., 2013a; Meyer et al., 2014) . While MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies were not detected in any other species of livestock tested, including chickens, goats, sheep, and cattle, seropositivity among camels passed 90% in every location, even in 2003 (Hemida et al., 2013; Perera et al., 2013; Reusken et al., 2013a, b; Meyer et al., 2014) . The high prevalence of neutralizing antibodies across age grades suggests pervasive and early infection of camels with MERS-CoV or a MERS-CoV-like virus. Recently, MERS-CoV virus was detected by RT-PCR in nose swabs from three camels in Qatar . The camels were epidemiologically linked to two human cases of MERS-CoV, and viral fragments sequenced from the camels showed high similarity to sequences from the human cases . While this datum provides more conclusive evidence that dromedary camels form part of the MERS-CoV outbreak picture, the direction of transmission is still unclear (Fig. 5 ). Transmission could have occurred from camels to humans, humans to camels, or concurrently from a third source to both humans and camels . Furthermore, the detection of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in dromedary camels in regions with no reported human cases, such as Egypt and the Canary Islands, raises questions about the extent of MERS-CoV or MERS-CoV-like virus circulation in Africa, the Arabic peninsula, and minor Asia Reusken et al., 2013b) . Movement of camels between Africa and the Arabian Peninsula is common and could contribute to the spread of MERS-CoV between regions (Mukasa-Mugerwa, 1981; Perera et al., 2013) .",

Conclusive evidence of humanto-human transmission of MERS-CoV was first reported in a cluster of MERS-CoV cases in the United Kingdom, when an adult male who had travelled to Saudi Arabia transmitted the virus to two of his family members (Health Protection Agency, 2013). Overall, MERS-CoV human-to-human transmission chains have been self-limiting and irregular, and more than half of secondary MERS-CoV cases have originated in a healthcare setting (WHO, 2014). The largest cluster of MERS-CoV to date has involved 23 patients at three different healthcare facilities in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, highlighting the potential of nosocomial transmission (Assiri et al., 2013b) . On the other hand, an early MERS-CoV patient transferred from Qatar to a specialist lung hospital in Germany was given intensive treatment for almost a month before the hospital learned of his MERS-CoV diagnosis. Extensive contact investigation and serological analysis of those potentially exposed to the patient revealed no secondary infections (Buchholz et al., 2013) . Screening of MERS-CoV patient contacts has uncovered at least 18 instances of asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection in healthcare workers and other contacts, although the role these subclinical cases can play in the transmission of infection is unclear (Memish et al., 2013a; The WHO MERS-CoV Research Group, 2013) . Transmission of respiratory viruses is often directly associated with the amount of virus shed. The dynamics of MERS-CoV shedding throughout the course of disease have not been well characterized, but high viral loads detected in bronchoalveolar lavage samples from infected patients suggests that coughing and exudates from the lower respiratory tract could be important mechanisms of MERS-CoV human-to-human transmission de Sousa et al., 2013) .",

R 0 is a measure of the number of secondary cases generated by one case of disease in a na\u20ac \u0131ve populationan R 0 of < 1 is self-limiting within a population. Using the epidemiological information from 62 probable cases of MERS-CoV infection, two different transmission scenarios were used to estimate the R 0 for MERS-CoV (Breban et al., 2013) . One scenario was modeled on a large number of index patients per cluster, each generating a small transmission tree, reflecting the possibility that two epidemiologically linked cases could have been exposed to the same nonhuman source of MERS-CoV. This scenario yielded an R 0 of 0.60 and a yearly MERS-CoV introduction rate of 22.3 (Breban et al., 2013) . The second scenario, which used a lower rate of introduction with higher human-to-human transmission, predicted an R 0 of 0.67 and a yearly introduction rate of 17.1 (Breban et al., 2013) . A large-scale analysis of full-genome sequences of MERS-CoV has identified multiple zoonotic introductions of the virus and distinct genomes circulating in the same geographic spaces, providing evidence for multiple zoonotic introductions and transmission dynamics in agreement with a lower R 0 (Cotten et al., 2013b) . Furthermore, a comparison of the R 0 s predicted for MERS-CoV and prepandemic SARS-CoV (R 0 of 0.8) suggests MERS-CoV has low pandemic potential (Breban et al., 2013) . Another transmission model of 111 MERS-CoV cases predicted a similar R 0 (0.63), but warned that in the absence of control measures, the R 0 could range between 0.8 and 1.3 and allow for self-sustaining transmission (Cauchemez et al., 2013) . Based on extrapolations of the incidence of disease in travelers returning from MERS-CoV-source countries, it was predicted that as many as 940 symptomatic cases of MERS-CoV may have occurred before August 8, 2013 (Cauchemez et al., 2013) . Epidemiologic studies will be necessary to assess the prevalence and circulation of MERS-CoV infection in the human population.",

Over two-thirds of the 5 0 end of the coronavirus genome is composed of the replicase open reading frames ORF1a and ORF1b (Masters, 2006) . In MERS-CoV, these ORFs are translated into two polyproteins, one requiring a ribosomal frame shift, which are eventually cleaved into 16 putative nonstructural proteins (nsps; Sawicki et al., 2007; van Boheemen et al., 2012) . The role of these nsps has not been empirically determined for MERS-CoV, but some function can be predicted based on conserved domains characterized in other coronaviruses. For instance, nsp12 putatively serves as the RdRp, and nsp14 is thought to function as the proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN; van . Interestingly, coronaviruses are the only RNA viruses known to use a specific proofreading enzyme for the maintenance of high-fidelity viral RNA replication (Smith et al., 2013) . Downstream of the two large ORFs are at least nine ORFs encoding the structural proteinsspike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsidand some accessory proteins . The translation of the downstream ORFs occurs via subgenomic mRNAs, a salient feature of the order to which coronaviruses belong: Nidovirales (Sawicki et al., 2007) .",

The MERS-CoV spike protein is a 1353 amino acid type-I transmembrane glycoprotein presented as a trimer on the surface of the enveloped virus. After translation, the spike protein is cleaved into two domains: the S1 subunit responsible for receptor binding and the S2 unit that mediates membrane fusion (Ohnuma et al., 2013; Raj et al., 2013) . The S1 spike glycoprotein binds to the surface enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26). DPP4 is a type-II transmembrane glycoprotein that catalyzes the cleavage of N-terminal proline-containing dipeptides and aids glucose metabolism by proteolytic inactivation of incretins (Engel et al., 2003; Hiramatsu et al., 2003; Lambeir et al., 2003) . DPP4 is the third exopeptidase found to act as a receptor for coronaviruses . Blocking the enzymatic activity of DPP4 does not affect MERS-CoV susceptibility, and so the significance of these enzymes as receptors for coronaviruses is thought to lie in their widespread expression on endothelial and epithelial tissues . DPP4 is relatively conserved between mammalian species, allowing MERS-CoV to bind to species as diverse as bats and humans Raj et al., 2013) . The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV, the region of the spike protein that attaches to the DPP4 receptor, has been mapped to 240 amino acid residues in the S1 region of the spike protein (Chen et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2013; Mou et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013) . Co-crystallization of MERS-CoV spike protein and DPP4 revealed an interaction between the beta-propeller blades 4 and 5 of DPP4 and beta-strands 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the MERS-CoV RBD, also known as the receptor-binding motif (RBM; Fig. 6 ; Lu et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013) . The RBD of the spike protein induces neutralizing antibodies, making it an important target for the development of prophylactics and therapeutics (Agnihothram et al., 2013; Du et al., 2013a, b, c; Gierer et al., 2013; Song et al., 2013) .",

            "text": "Preliminary investigations of MERS-CoV host interactions and innate immune responses have been performed in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo in a nonhuman primate model. MERS-CoV has been shown to replicate in vitro in human, bat, and porcine-derived cell lines, whereas cow, hamster, murine, rat, and canine cell lines were not susceptible Chan et al., 2013b; Dijkman et al., 2013; Kindler et al., 2013; Raj et al., 2013; Scobey et al., 2013) . While in vitro modeling holds some predictive value for MERS-CoV susceptibility in vivo, a more complete characterization of the mechanisms of cellular entry is necessary to understand host susceptibility (Leow, 2013) . For instance, the species tropism of MERS-CoV appears to be restricted by variability in the cellular receptor. MERS-CoV is unable to replicate in mice, hamsters, or ferretscommon small animal modelsand the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein is unable to bind ferret-specific DPP4 (Coleman et al., 2013; de Wit et al., 2013a; Raj et al., 2014) . (a) The linear organization of the S1 subunit of MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein with the variable RBD located at amino acid residues 367-607, with a RBM containing the critical amino acid residues for binding at residues 484-567. (b) The crystal structure of the MERS-CoV RBD coupled with the receptor dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4). DPP4 is structurally divided into an alpha-and beta-hydrolase domain, and a beta-propeller domain. The beta-propeller domain of DPP4 (pink) interacts with the RBM region (light blue) of the MERS-CoV spike protein RBD. The schematic representation of the DPP4 -MERS-CoV spike protein RBD structure was generated using chimera and protein accession number 4KR0 (Lu et al., 2013) . (Josset et al., 2013 ). Yet consistent with observations of SARS-CoV infection, MERS-CoV infection of human respiratory cells does not lead to a pronounced type-I IFN response (Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007; Kindler et al., 2013; Zielecki et al., 2013) . Type-I IFNs play a key role in viral immunity, and pathogenic viruses often evade innate immunity through antagonist proteins that disrupt the IFN reaction (Garc \u0131a-Sastre & Biron, 2006; Randall & Goodbourn, 2008; Taylor & Mossman, 2013) . In MERS-CoV, inhibition of type-I IFNs has been demonstrated by the structural M protein and the accessory proteins encoded by ORF 4a, ORF 4b, and ORF 5 . The most potent inhibitor, ORF 4a, has been shown to inhibit type-I IFN activation by blocking the interaction between the RNA helicase sensor MDA5 and viral double-stranded RNA, a mechanism distinct from that employed by SARS-CoV (Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007; Niemeyer et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2013) .",

            "text": "Mathematical transmission models highlight two important ways MERS-CoV can be controlled: reducing the rate of MERS-CoV introductions into the human population and breaking chains of human-to-human transmission. The reduction in the rate of MERS-CoV introductions in the human population requires a comprehensive understanding of the nonhuman source of MERS-CoV and the spatial and temporal dynamics of MERS-CoV circulation in this source. On the other hand, interrupting the human-to-human transmission cycle of MERS-CoV calls for an understanding of the parameters involved in transmission, such as virus shedding, stability, and routes of transmission. Although routes of transmission for MERS-CoV are not well understood, the spread of MERS-CoV between people in close contact settings suggests that direct contact and fomite transmission routes are likely to be involved. As stated above, the localization of MERS-CoV infection in the lower respiratory tract implicates coughing and other exudates as important sources of virus shedding. In addition, the environmental stability of MERS-CoV provides some information on the potential for fomite transmission. At low temperatures and humidity, both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV virions retain viability on smooth surfaces much longer than many other respiratory viruses, including influenza virus H1N1, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43 (Sizun et al., 2000; Chan et al., 2011; van Doremalen et al., 2013) . Thus, temperature-controlled settings such as hospitals may be of particular risk for fomite transmission of MERS-CoV. Performing high-risk patient care procedures such as intubation and manual ventilation, along with inconsistent use of surgical masks, was associated with nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV to healthcare workers (Ofner-Agostini et al., 2006; Nishiyama et al., 2008) . Healthcare workers are a growing cohort of MERS-CoV cases, but while routes of exposure may be similar for both viruses, the MERS-CoV outbreak has not been characterized by the hospital-based super-spreader events which defined the epidemiology of SARS-CoV (Lipsitch et al., 2003) .",

Thus, SARS-CoV transmission could be prevented in the general population by basic public health and infection control measures, such as the isolation of patients in negative-pressure rooms, active surveillance and quarantine of contacts, and the provision of education and protective equipment for healthcare workers (Twu et al., 2003; Svoboda et al., 2004) . Estimates of the serial interval of MERS-CoV infection in the largest cluster of MERS-CoV to date -23 cases in a hospital settingare slightly shorter than those for SARS-CoV (median 7.6 vs. 8.4 days), suggesting that transmission may occur earlier in the course of illness (Assiri et al., 2013b) .

These drugs were used to varying extents on SARS-CoV patients, often in combination with corticosteroids (Stockman et al., 2006; Cheng et al., 2013) . Ribavirin is a structural analog of guanosine with broad-spectrum mutagenic effects on viruses. Despite its frequent use on SARS-CoV patients, ribavirin was not shown to be effective for patients, and adverse effects such as hemolytic anemia were common (Stockman et al., 2006; Cheng et al., 2013) . Type-I IFN regimens for SARS-CoV patients were sometimes used as part of a multi-drug regimen, and one study of 22 SARS-CoV patients reported more rapid improvement of radiographic lung pathologies and better oxygenation in patients treated with IFN-a1 (Loutfy et al., 2003; Stockman et al., 2006; Cheng et al., 2013) . Speculations that immunopathology rather than uncontrolled viral replication contributed to lung deterioration during advanced SARS-CoV infection favored the widespread use of corticosteroids in its treatment (Nicholls et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003; Hui & Sung, 2004; Cheng et al., 2013) . Retrospective analysis of SARS-CoV patients showed no benefit of corticosteroid administration except when critical cases were analyzed alone and death-related variables were adjusted. Among these critical patients, corticosteroid therapy did significantly reduce case fatality (Chen, 2006) . Similarly, corticosteroids have been used in some MERS-CoV patients with severe disease Guberina et al., 2013; Memish et al., 2013b; Omrani et al., 2013) . One previously healthy MERS-CoV patient who suffered ARDS, multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and suspected concomitant allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis improved rapidly when treated with the corticosteroid prednisolone (Guberina et al., 2013) . The efficacy of corticosteroid treatment for other MERS-CoV patients with ARDS has not been reported.",

            "text": "Therapies used during the SARS-CoV outbreak have shaped investigations of treatment regimens for MERS--CoV. MERS-CoV shows greater sensitivity than SARS-CoV to the antiviral effects of type-I and type-III IFNs in vitro and ex vivo (Kindler et al., 2013; Wilde et al., 2013; Zielecki et al., 2013) . This greater sensitivity could be explained by mechanistic differences of IFN antagonist accessory proteins between the viruses. For instance, MERS-CoV lacks a homologue of the SARS-CoV ORF6 protein, which blocks the STAT1-activating effects of IFNs and ultimately the transcriptional activation of downstream antiviral genes (Wilde et al., 2013) . A comparison of five different IFNs has shown IFN-b to be the most potent inhibitor of MERS-CoV (Hart et al., 2013) . Although high concentrations of ribavirin were effective in vitro in one study , another study found no inhibitory effects of ribavirin at a dose translatable to current drug regiments in humans (Hart et al., 2013) . When IFN-a2b and ribavirin were used in combination against MERS-CoV, however, the 50% effective concentrations (EC 50 ) of the drugs in combination were much lower than for the individual drugs. This additive effect decreased the drug requirements to concentrations potentially achievable in humans . Interestingly, ribavirin is significantly more effective when the ExoN activity of coronaviruses is knocked out (Smith et al., 2013) . Data indicate that in these knockout viruses, ribavirin has a greater ability to inhibit viral RNA synthesis and inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), and enzyme necessary for the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides, which would explain the relatively high ribavirin dose needed to achieve inhibition of viral replication with MERS-CoV (Smith et al., 2013) .",

In rhesus macaques, MERS-CoV causes a lower respiratory tract infection reminiscent of mild to moderate human cases . Clinical signs of MERS-CoV-infected macaques included cough and increased respiration rate, and lung samples showed lesions characteristic of mild to marked pneumonia de Wit et al., 2013b) . Virus was detected throughout the respiratory tract and mediastinal lymph nodes, with viral loads higher earlier during infection. The primary sites of virus replication were type-I and type-II pneumocytes, main components of the alveolar architecture. Replication of MERS-CoV deep in the macaque lower respiratory tract may explain the low potential for transmission of MERS-CoV. Despite renal failure in some human patients, virus was absent from the kidney tissue of all macaques . A more recent characterization of MERS-CoV in rhesus macaques reported transient fever in infected monkeys and demonstrated a MERS-CoV-specific antibody response in the macaques starting at 7 days postinfection (Yao et al., 2013) . The rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV infection is the only in vivo model established to date, and development of a small animal model is essential to conduct widespread research on pathogenesis and prophylactic and therapeutic countermeasures.",

The efficacy of a combination IFN-a2b and ribavirin treatment regimen was tested in MERS-CoV-infected rhesus macaques . Doses were designed to achieve serum concentrations at or above the EC 50 values determined in vitro. Treated animals did not show the clinical signs or hematological changes that developed in the untreated animals, such as breathing difficulties, decreased oxygen saturation levels, and increased neutrophil counts . Gross pathology of lungs from treated animals was normal, while untreated animals displayed visible lesions. Histopathology revealed mild signs of bronchointerstitial pneumonia in the treated animals, with more abundant alveolar edema and severe lesions seen in the untreated animals. The MERS-CoV viral load in lung samples was 0.81 log lower for treated animals compared to untreated animals. Furthermore, a lung-specific host response occurred in untreated macaques but not in treated animals, with increased levels of the cytokines and chemokines IL-6, IFN-y, and MCP-1. Reduced expression of inflammatory genes was observed in the lungs of treated animals . The significant improvement in clinical score for treated animals despite relatively similar viral loads between the groups suggests that immunopathology may be a factor in the severity of MERS-CoV infection. However, because the rhesus macaque model only recapitulates mild to moderate disease in humans, the effectiveness of these drugs against MERS-CoV-induced ARDS is unclear. Timing is also critical to the efficacy of treatment; most patients do not begin treatment until they are quite ill, whereas drug regimens in the macaques began only 8 h postinoculation. The translation of drug regimens from the laboratory to the clinic must address such discrepancies.",

The spike protein, and especially its RBD, is considered a key component in coronavirus vaccine design (Du et al., 2009 (Du et al., , 2013b . A replication-defective vaccinia virus-based vaccine expressing the full-length spike protein of MERS-CoV has been shown to produce high levels of neutralizing antibodies in mice, but virus challenge cannot be applied to the mouse model (Song et al., 2013) .Vaccination with recombinant protein containing a truncated RBD of the spike protein (amino acids 377-588) and the Fc of human IgG also induced high titers of neutralizing antibodies. The truncated RBD elicited higher levels of neutralizing antibodies than vaccination with a recombinant protein containing a larger fragment of the spike protein (amino acids 377-662). The authors suggest that non-neutralizing epitopes within the 588-662 region of the polypeptide may compete with neutralizing epitopes or destabilize the formation of the RBD (Du et al., 2013b) . To maximize the protectiveness of neutralizing antibodies across MERS-CoV strains, the natural variation of MERS-CoV spike proteins needs to be characterized and considered in the design of vaccines (Graham et al., 2013) . Live-attenuated viruses are another approach to MERS-CoV vaccine development. A MERS-CoV mutant lacking the structural E protein has been shown to be replication-competent but propagation-defective (Almaz an et al., 2013) . Development of safe and effective MERS-CoV vaccines must potentially overcome the challenges that arose for SARS-CoV. No in vivo testing of vaccines has been performed to date; it remains therefore unclear whether challenge with MERS-CoV would illicit pulmonary immunopathology upon challenge. Creative approaches, such as the use of adjuvants that promote T H 1 cell responses, need to be pursued, and potential vaccines must be rigorously evaluated in animal models (Graham et al., 2013) .",

The initial detection of MERS-CoV was followed by the rapid development of MERS-CoV molecular and serological diagnostics (Corman et al., 2012a, b) . The emergence of MERS-CoV reminded the infectious disease community of the emergence of SARS-CoV and called for immediate public health preparedness and response. Research efforts have largely focused on the epidemiology of the outbreak and identification of putative natural and intermediate reservoirs and potential therapeutics. Some controversy has surrounded the identification and sharing of MERS-CoV isolatesthe initial isolate was shared without the consent of the Saudi Arabian government, and material transfer agreements (MTA) of some isolates were said to be unnecessarily restrictive (Butler, 2013) . An MTA has several purposes: it defines not only the material to be transferred, but who can use the materials and what the purpose of the transfer is. It also protects the intellectual property rights of each party by defining ownership of the original material and inventions resulting from the use of the material. Lastly, it designates liability of each party and ensures that the receiving party will use the material in a safe way (for instance, at the proper biosafety level). The controversies surrounding the initial detection of MERS-CoV highlight the importance of creating an international framework for rapid global sharing of virus strains and biologic materials during outbreaks. Similar controversies over ownership have arisen with H5N1 avian influenza (Fidler, 2008) . Both the avian flu virus and the MERS-CoV cases strongly point to the need not only for prenegotiated transfer agreements but also for standardized 'best practices' guidelines for highly virulent emerging disease materials where expedited sharing of material and data is of paramount importance.",

The widespread distribution of dromedary camels across Africa, the Arabic peninsula, and South-West Asia highlights their potential to facilitate the outbreak's spread (Fig. 7) , but information on the spatial and temporal patterns of MERS-CoV circulation in this species is needed.

Of particular interest is the effect of comorbidities on MERS-CoV pathogenesis and patient outcomes. Preliminary evidence shows a direct relation between underlying comorbidities and disease severity . The observation that primary cases have been more severe Fig. 7 Geographic distribution of dromedary camels. The global distribution of dromedary camels is indicated by yellow shading (Mukasa-Mugerwa, 1981 ). than secondary cases, even when controlling for underlying conditions, might suggest that these primary cases were exposed to higher virus doses than secondary cases (The WHO MERS-CoV Research Group, 2013) . This could also indicate that MERS-CoV is more readily transmissible from the intermediate reservoir to humans than from human-to-human and that milder MERS-CoV cases would be less likely to efficiently transmit MERS-CoV. Human-to-human transmission could increase if MERS-CoV becomes better adapted to humans. Prolonged MERS-CoV replication in immune-compromised patients could increase opportunity for the virus to acquire mutations enabling efficient transmission. The development and testing of MERS-CoV therapeutics is currently hindered by the absence of small animal models. In addition, phase I-III clinical trials need to be conducted before experimental vaccines and treatment options can be available to humans. Accordingly, research focusing on already-approved drugs for the treatment of MERS-CoV with result in faster implementation and wider availability of therapeutics in the clinic.",

Globalization, climate change, habitat alteration, and wildlife encroachment likely contribute to novel interactions between pathogens and hosts. Adequate preparation for future infectious disease outbreaks requires strong international relationships in research, monitoring and surveillance, and public health response. In 2005, after facing the emergence of SARS-CoV and avian influenza H5N1, the WHO (2013b) developed International Health Regulations for the coordination of global responses to emerging health threats. The WHO has structured its MERS-CoV response according to these regulations, forming an emergency committee on MERS-CoV, creating case definitions of infection, and providing frequent updates of the MERS-CoV outbreak through the IHR's global alert and response function. The Program for Monitoring of Emerging Diseases (ProMED-mail), which communicated the first report of MERS-CoV infection in a human, has also continued to provide the global health and research communities with updates of epidemiological reports and scientific findings. Capacity building, knowledge transfer, and training of the future generation of scientists are key factors in forming multidisciplinary preparedness for future infectious disease outbreaks. In this regard, special attention should be given to prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases in the developing world, the origin of the majority of infectious disease outbreaks.",

Currently, the exact route of zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV into the human population remains unknown although the presence of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies and the detection of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels suggest that this species is likely to play a major role in the emergence of MERS-CoV. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that multiple introductions of MERS--CoV into the human population have occurred and both zoonotic transmission events and human-to-human transmission (blue arrows) drive the current MERS-CoV outbreak.",
