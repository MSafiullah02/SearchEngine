            "text": "Physical examination of the cardiovascular system involves examination of mucous membranes for color, refill time, and moistness; thoracic palpation and auscultation, assessment of arterial pulse quality via the median or medial saphenous arteries; assessment of jugular filling; and palpation of the ventrum for edema. Common ancillary tests include blood analysis, blood pressure measurement, thoracic radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography. The areas suitable for cardiac auscultation lie conveniently within the short-fleeced axilla, under the forelimb above the elbow. On the left side, the pulmonic valve is heard best over the third intercostal space, under the triceps brachii, whereas the aortic valve area is located more dorsally at the fourth intercostal space. The mitral valve area is located more ventrally on the left hemithorax at the costochondral junctions over the fourth or fifth intercostal space, and the tricuspid valve is heard best on the right hemithorax over the fourth intercostal space at the caudal edge of the triceps brachii. Areas over all valves should be palpated for the presence of a thrill. Healthy adult camelids in the Oregon State University herd have resting heart rates between 48 and 72 beats per minute (beats/min), with rare individuals spiking up to 84 beats/min. This range is slightly lower than the 60 to 90 beats/min or higher rates that are sometimes cited. Adults with higher heart rates are likely to be excessively stressed, volume depleted, or otherwise compromised. Neonates typically have heart rates varying from 90 to 120 beats/min, although rates up to 140 beats/min may be found in some newborns. Juveniles typically will have heart rates less than 100 beats/min by age 1 month, and this declines to the adult range by age 1 year.1\n",

            "text": "The first and second heart sounds should be heard clearly on the left side of the thorax in all but the most obese camelids. These sounds are more difficult to discern on the right side but should be audible in an adequately restrained camelid in a quiet environment. With careful auscultation, soft third and fourth sounds are discernible in some healthy camelids. Loud S3 or S4 heart sounds are usually indicative of serious cardiac disease, reflecting the presence of ventricular enlargement and ventricular dysfunction. Physiologic and innocent murmurs are often identified in adult and immature camelids. Anemic, systemically ill, and even apparently healthy camelids may exhibit soft, nonpathologic systolic murmurs (\u2264grade 3 of 6) over the left heart base. These murmurs are usually crescendo\u2013decrescendo, ejection-type murmurs occupying midsystole, with preservation of the first and second heart sounds. Scansen and co-workers recently identified high-velocity and turbulent flow in the branch pulmonary arteries of several young crias and offered an elegant explanation for some of the innocent murmurs identified in immature camelids.2 The murmur and the flow disturbances resolved within a few months, which suggests that this finding is benign, therein resembling the condition of peripheral pulmonary stenosis seen in human infants. Often, however, the precise cause of these soft murmurs is not apparent even with the aid of color flow echocardiographic evaluation.",

            "text": "Loud systolic murmurs are abnormal and may be detected in camelids with septal defects, outflow tract obstructions, and insufficiency of the atrioventricular (AV) valves. The systolic murmur of a ventricular septal defect may be either band shaped or crescendo\u2013decrescendo and is typically best heard on the right side of the chest. Heart murmurs resulting from outflow tract obstruction are typically crescendo\u2013decrescendo or diamond-shaped and are usually best heard at the left heart base. The regurgitant murmurs of AV valve insufficiency are typically band shaped or plateau shaped and are best heard at the left or right apex, depending on the valve affected. Regurgitant murmurs tend to be longer (pansystolic) than systolic ejection murmurs (holosystolic), so both the first and second heart sounds are usually obscured in camelids with AV valve insufficiency. In comparison with horses and dogs, insufficiency of the AV valves occurs much less commonly in llamas and alpacas. Diastolic murmurs are also relatively rare, almost always clinically significant, and are usually caused by insufficiency of the aortic valve, or more rarely, the pulmonic valve. Such murmurs are usually best heard at the heart base on the left side of the thorax. The continuous murmur of a posterior descending artery (PDA) is also best heard at the left heart base as in other species. It is important to recognize that many significant congenital and acquired cardiac lesions in camelids result in no discernible murmur. For example, camelids with a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) and pulmonary hypertension may not evidence a murmur but will often have accentuated splitting of the second heart sound because of asynchronous closure of the semilunar valves. Thus, it must be appreciated that auscultation alone is not entirely reliable for ruling out the presence of cardiac disease.",

            "text": "The lymphatic system is often conveniently assessed by examining the size of peripheral lymph nodes, particularly when they are enlarged because of inflammation or neoplasia. Moreover, it is not uncommon to identify disorders of the lymphatic system by inference when lymph accumulates in a body cavity or regional pitting is noted in an extremity. The easiest lymph nodes to find in normal camelids include the prescapular nodes located near the base of the neck and the superficial inguinal nodes located in the inguinal region close to the ventral body wall. Other peripheral nodes are difficult to locate in healthy camelids because they often comprise a collection of small nodules. Emaciation or pathologic node enlargement facilitates successful palpation of the submandibular, retropharyngeal, and popliteal nodes, which are often very hard to identify in healthy animals.",

            "text": "Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are primarily recorded to elucidate the nature of an auscultated rhythm disturbance. A standardized six-lead ECG may be easily obtained in the standing camelid by attaching two electrodes above the olecranon on the forelimbs and the remaining two electrodes just above the patellas on the hindlimbs. Leads are attached with alligator clips and wetted with alcohol. Clipping the fleece is usually not necessary. It is often preferable to obtain ECGs in young crias by restraining them in right lateral recumbency. In either circumstance, ECG tracings are most easily interpreted when a paper speed of 50 millimeters per second (mm/s) is selected for the recording. It is useful to complement the limb leads with a rhythm strip that is recorded by using a base\u2013apex lead; the rhythm strip is obtained by repositioning the right front leg electrode to the base of the neck on the right and by moving the left front leg electrode to a location over the cardiac apex on the left side of the chest. This lead often provides the largest amplitude complexes thereby facilitating cardiac rhythm analysis.3\n",

            "text": "Normal ECG reference values for camelids have been reported in several published studies (Figure 36-1\n).4, 5, 6 In the recent report by Kraus and coworkers, heart rate was seen to vary from 60 to 100 beats/min with a mean heart rate of 80 beats/min.6 The mean (+/\u2212 standard deviation [SD]) duration of the electrical events were reported as follows: P waves: \u221240 milliseconds (ms; +/\u2212 12); PQ interval: 150 ms (+/\u2212 33); QRS complex: 50 ms (+/\u2212 8); Q\u2013T interval: 360 ms (+/\u2212 60); ST segment: 230 ms (+/\u2212 46). QRS morphology was found to be extremely variable. The mean polarity of the QRS complexes was negative in 60% of the lead I recordings, in 56% of the lead II recordings, and in 51% of the lead III recordings. The QRS complex was least variable for lead V10, where the QRS complexes were positive in 88% of the animals examined. The amplitudes of the R and S waves tended to be low in the limb leads, as often noted in herbivores. Values obtained from mean electrical axis (MEA) estimations were extremely variable but were directed mainly to the right and in a cranial direction. In contrast to humans and small animals, ECG recordings obtained from camelids provide little information about the overall size of the heart or the enlargement of specific chambers. The Purkinje fiber network of camelids penetrates completely through the wall of the ventricles from the endocardium to the epicardium, as in sheep, resulting in a pattern of activation that effectively obscures the hallmarks of chamber enlargement seen in humans and smaller mammals such as the dog and the cat.4, 7 In our experience, neither the recorded voltage nor the estimated MEA appears to be useful for the detection of chamber enlargement.",

It is, of course, always important to integrate physical examination findings, laboratory determinations (such as arterial blood gas [ABG] analysis), and thoracic imaging studies to arrive at an accurate diagnosis. Practical considerations in adult animals often limit thoracic radiographic imaging to a standing lateral view (Figure 36-2\n), but this single view is usually adequate to distinguish primary airway or pulmonary parenchymal disease from pulmonary compromise caused by left-sided heart failure (Figure 36-3\n). Thoracic radiography is also useful for identifying pleural effusion, its severity, and its likely cause. In this regard, it is complementary to thoracic ultrasonography. In neonates, thoracic radiography is particularly useful for distinguishing heart disease from the far more common pulmonary parenchymal diseases associated with immaturity or infection. It is often possible to obtain lateral and dorsoventral radiographs in young crias, and two-view studies are advisable whenever they can be accomplished without causing undue stress to the animal. Chemical restraint should also be considered to optimize the quality of the imaging study when the condition of the animal permits. This often causes less duress compared with physical restraint.",

The carina is typically located at the fourth rib or in the fourth intercostal space. The ratio of heart height to the height of the thorax, both measured along the cardiac long access, ranges from 0.68 to 0.74 in healthy adult llamas, and 0.65 to 0.84 in alpaca crias.8, 9 Cardiomegaly is usually obvious in camelids with serious heart disease and is typically revealed by an increase in cardiac width beyond three intercostal spaces, an increase in heart height beyond three fourths the height of the thorax, and elevation of the trachea with reduction in the angle of divergence from the thoracic spine below the reported normal range of 10\u00b0 to 19\u00b0 (mean 14.4\u00b0 + 2.0\u00b0) in adult llamas, and 9\u00b0 to 22\u00b0 (mean 14.2\u00b0 + 3.6\u00b0) in alpaca crias.8, 9 Using a modification of the Buchanan vertebral heart score (VHS) system, Mattoon and colleagues have provided scaled criteria for identifying cardiomegaly in llamas.8 According to this method, the height plus width of the normal adult llama heart ranges from 7.7 to 9.1 \u201cvertebral lengths\u201d (mean VHS = 8.4) or 2.75 to 3.55 times the distance from the cranial aspect of T3 to the caudal aspect of T5.

Left heart enlargement is usually easily identified on the lateral radiograph, but reliable identification of right heart enlargement is often more problematic. In young crias, dorsoventral thoracic radiography allows for more sensitive detection of right heart enlargement. In crias, the mean cardiac height plus width to T3-5 ratio on dorsoventral radiography has been reported as 2.5 \u00b1 0.25 and the cardiac to thoracic width ratio as 0.80 \u00b1 0.06.

In young crias, the ratio of the right cranial pulmonary artery to third rib has been reported as 0.42 + 0.11 and the ratio of the right cranial pulmonary vein to third rib as 0.45 + 0.11. In adult llamas, the ratio of the right cranial pulmonary artery to the height of T4 is reported as 0.28 \u00b1 0.04 and the ratio of the right pulmonary vein to the height of T4 as 0.30 \u00b1 0.04. Thus, in normal camelids, the cranial lobar pulmonary veins are similar in size or only slightly larger than the accompanying arteries. Developing left heart failure should be considered when the pulmonary veins are substantially larger than the arteries. When interstitial or alveolar perihilar infiltrates are identified together with enlarged pulmonary veins and an enlarged left atrium, congestive heart failure (CHF) is likely. In animals suspect for congenital heart disease, pulmonary overcirculation, resulting from a left-to-right\u2013shunting PDA or VSD, is typically evidenced by concurrent enlargement of the cranial lobar arteries and veins together, with an overall increase in the opacity of the lungs. Right-to-left shunts, in turn, are usually evidenced by diminutive pulmonary vessels and reduced opacity of the lung fields. Evaluation of caudal vena caval size is also easily accomplished on lateral radiography, and this assessment takes on added importance in camelids when right heart failure is suspected, since jugular venous distension cannot be readily evaluated by physical examination. As a general rule, the diameter of the caudal vena cava should not exceed the height of the body of the fourth thoracic vertebrae.",

The techniques used to perform echocardiography in camelids do not differ substantially from those used in other large animal species. Low-frequency transducers, ranging from 2 to 3.5 megahertz (MHz), are required to adequately examine adult animals. In crias, either a 5-MHz or a 7.5-MHz transducer provides the necessary resolution required for optimally imaging immature patients. Uncooperative subjects should be sedated if their clinical condition is sufficiently stable. Interrogation of the heart is typically accomplished from a combination of imaging windows located at the ventral aspect of the fourth or fifth intercostal space on the right side of the thorax and at the cardiac apex on the left. To obtain optimal images from the right side, it is very helpful to have the right forelimb positioned as far forward as the animal will accommodate so that the ultrasound transducer can be positioned as far cranial and dorsal as the lung permits. From this location, two-dimensional images should be obtained in six short-axis imaging planes through the left ventricle: (1) through the cardiac apex, (2) at the level of the papillary muscles, (3) the chordae tendineae, (4) the mitral valve, (5) the heart base at the level of the aorta and left atrium, and, if possible, (6) at the level of the main pulmonary artery as it bifurcates at the origin of the left and right pulmonary arteries (Figure 36-4\n). Two long-axis imaging planes should be recorded from this same location by rotating the transducer counterclockwise to obtain an image plane that optimizes a view of the left ventricular outflow tract and another imaging plane optimizing a view of all four chambers of the heart together with the mitral and tricuspid valves (Figure 36-5\n). Echocardiography may also be used to examine the heart of the fetus for malformations (Figure 36-6\n).",

Not only can the architecture of the heart be easily visualized and accurately measured, but flow disturbances within the heart and great vessels can be easily appreciated and quantified. Images are initially obtained from the right side of the thorax, where flow disturbances in the vicinity of the pulmonic, aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valves can often be appreciated. From this location, accurate flow velocity determinations via spectral Doppler can be achieved only for flow through the pulmonic valve, as such measures require the interrogating ultrasound beam to be parallel with the direction of flow. Nonetheless, it is often possible to document flow disturbances resulting from aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valvular insufficiency or from a VSD via the right parasternal long axis views (Figure 36-8\n). Echocardiographic imaging from the left apical region on the left side of the chest allows the generation of four-chamber and five-chamber views of the heart, the latter referring to the inclusion of the four cardiac chambers plus the LV outflow tract together with the proximal aorta. This view is particularly useful for evaluating the velocity of blood flow as it moves away from the transducer while flowing out through the aortic valve. Increased flow velocity usually indicates outflow tract obstruction, but mildly increased flow velocities may also be observed with left-to-right shunts and other causes of increased stroke volume. Quantification of valvular stenosis and insufficiency via the modality of spectral Doppler velocity recordings has supplanted cardiac catheterization as the preferred method for determining disease severity. Transvalvular flow velocities recorded in healthy llamas and alpacas are very similar to those reported for dogs and cats. It is noteworthy that often very small jets of valvular insufficiency are present in the immediate vicinity of all the cardiac valves in healthy camelids, and such observations should not be considered indicative of valve disease.11\n",

Affected animals have a decreased activity level or tolerance for exercise. To differentiate shunting from other causes of hypoxemia, presupplemental and postsupplemental oxygen concentrations may be compared; shunts prevent an increase in PaO2, whereas oxygenation increases with most other causes of hypoxemia. Serial ABG analyses may be used to track failure, as some animals with left-to-right shunts or a mixture of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood entering the aorta will have a worsening of hypoxemia as left heart failure progresses.",

In some affected animals, the point of maximum intensity of the murmur is located at the left heart base, but a right-sided murmur is almost always still identifiable. When the defect is located in the muscular portion of the interventricular septum, the murmur may be heard in a more caudal location on the right side of the thorax near the cardiac apex. On those occasions where aortic insufficiency develops as a consequence of an undermined aortic root, an additional diastolic murmur may be heard in association with the VSD murmur, producing a characteristic \u201cto and fro\u201d type of cardiac murmur. With sufficiently large defects, the volume-overloaded left heart dilates, develops mitral insufficiency, and eventually fails. In animals with very large defects, plexiform lesions develop in the pulmonary arterioles, resulting in the development of irreversible pulmonary hypertension.

Ostium secundum ASDs develop in the middle of the interatrial septum, in the region of the fossa ovalis, and are the most common type of ASD. Sinus venosus ASDs occur in the uppermost region of the interatrial septum, typically in association with anomalous pulmonary venous drainage. In crias, the foramen ovale is patent at birth and usually closes within the first 2 weeks of life. In the absence of cardiac enlargement, a patent foramen ovale (PFO) is generally regarded to be of little consequence, as the higher left atrial pressure results in physiologic closure of this potential communication between the atria. Significant shunting across a PFO only becomes problematic when another cardiac disorder causes an increase in atrial pressure and atrial enlargement sufficiently severe to allow shunting similar to that seen with a small secundum type ASD.

Aortic stenosis appears to be particularly uncommon in camelids. Congenital aortic and pulmonic valvular insufficiency are also apparently very rare, as is dysplasia of the mitral or tricuspid valves.17 Mitral dysplasia causes respiratory compromise and exercise intolerance when severe, whereas tricuspid defects result in jugular distention, jugular pulses, pleural effusions, and ascites. Hematocysts are sometimes observed on the AV valves at necropsy, but such lesions rarely result in valvular insufficiency. Confirmation of a suspected congenital valvular defect is best accomplished by echocardiography. No reports describing the treatment of such defects in camelids have been published.",

            "text": "Complete endocardial cushion defects have been reported in a number of camelids, including a pair of llamas with a common dam.16 This malformation, sometimes referred to as an AV septal defect or AV canal, consists of lesions involving those structures formed by the endocardial cushions, including the lower portion of the atrial septum and upper portion of the ventricular septum, the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve, and the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. The consequence of this combination of lesions is admixture of oxygenated and unoxygenated blood within a \u201csingle chamber\u201d compounded by the volume loads resulting from AV valvular insufficiency. A systolic murmur is typically present in such cases and may often be heard on both sides of the chest. Affected camelids usually display clinical signs within the first weeks or months of life. These signs include weakness, cyanosis, lethargy, exercise intolerance, increased time spent in recumbency, decreased nursing, open-mouthed breathing, dyspnea, and poor growth. Engorged jugular and other peripheral veins, pleural effusion, ascites, and passive congestion of the abdominal organs may be present. Echocardiography reveals the communicating heart chambers (Figure 36-10\n). Color flow Doppler echocardiography reveals dramatic lesions with bilateral AV valve insufficiency and shunting through the combined ASD and VSD. All chambers of the heart are enlarged, but the right side is often enlarged to the extent that it provides the apex of the heart. Severe systolic dysfunction is typically present and pulmonary hypertension may also be evident. Although one llama appears to have survived adequately for 1 year at less than 300 meters (m) above sea level, other affected camelids have shown clinical signs at a young age. Once clinical signs develop, the affected animal usually dies or is euthanized within a few weeks or months. Interestingly, one affected 2-year-old llama began to show signs only after spending a year at high altitude. Diuretics have been used to palliate the clinical signs, but they do not have much effect on the progression of the disease or the eventual outcome. The occurrence of this defect in two related camelids raises the likelihood of a genetic cause, but the heritability of this defect remains speculative.",

Extreme variants of this abnormality include those cases in which the pulmonic valve and the main pulmonary artery are completely atretic, creating the appearance of a \u201cpseudo\u201d truncus arteriosus (Figure 36-11\n). In such cases, pulmonary perfusion is accomplished by a PDA connecting the aorta to the right and left pulmonary arteries.

This anomaly is often accompanied by aberrant origination of the right subclavian artery (Figure 36-15\n). The more familiar right aortic arch with constricting left ligamentum has also been observed. In those cases with a PDA, the size of the shunt was small, and a continuous murmur was only noted in one affected alpaca. Most affected animals presented at ages 3 to 5 months, and the clinical signs were largely attributable to constriction of the esophagus. Dysphagia, abnormal regurgitation, choke, bloat, and failure to thrive are common clinical signs. Cough may also occur as a consequence of tracheobronchitis or pneumonia caused by inoculation of the airways with swallowed and regurgitated food. On occasion, the development of clinical signs may be delayed until early adulthood. Routine thoracic radiography often demonstrates a dilated esophagus both cranial and caudal to the heart base, sometimes with retained ingesta. It is sometimes possible to identify a persistent right aortic arch on a dorsoventral thoracic radiograph, but other vascular ring malformations may easily escape detection.",

The primary source of infection may be more instrumental in determining blood abnormalities than endocarditis. We have seen increases in liver and muscle enzymes, azotemia, and degenerative leukograms in connection with diffuse hepatic infection, hepatomegaly, and right heart failure. Abdominocentesis or other pertinent tests may also reveal information about the underlying inflammatory disorder or may just reveal copious ascites.",

Myocardial cells lose their resting potential, pacemaker function, and eventually all electrical functions. Enterohepatic circulation of toxins leads to extended effects.

The subjectivity comes from the fact that most published reference ranges related to red blood cell (RBC) or hemoglobin mass appear to be more generous at the upper end of the range and less so at the lower end, where the bulk of the camelids seen at my practice lie.

This may be explained by the following apparent anomaly: A roughly linear relationship appears to exist between PCV or erythrocyte count and hemoglobin concentration in camelids except that hemoglobin concentration appears to plateau above 10 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) as PCV declines through the twenties and erythrocyte count declines from about 13 to 10 \u00d7106 cells per microliter (cells/\u00b5L).

Even below those values, camelids appear to be very good at hiding the effects of anemia. Camelids with PCV values in the teens may not be detected by decreased energy or activity, unless the camelid is observed carefully. In the PCV ranges from about 12% to 7%, camelids will often continue to eat and move about, although they usually lie down instead of fighting when handled or pursued and may have evidence of exercise intolerance.

Once these lower thresholds are surpassed, it may be worth performing a PCV-to-protein calculation. When PCV is 20% or less, if blood loss is the primary problem, the PCV should be approximately 8.7 to 10.8 times the plasma albumin concentration (in mg/dL) and 4 to 15.4 times the plasma total protein concentration (in mg/dL). Ratios less than this tend to reflect disproportionate protein loss and indicate the need for further evaluation of protein-losing processes rather than blood loss. Higher ratios are rare, especially for the albumin comparison, and may reflect hemolysis or decreased production. For the protein comparison, they may also reflect concurrent hyperglobulinemia.",

Even in the face of moderate to severe anemia, the magnitude of the regenerative response is often underwhelming. Once PCV drops below approximately 13% in clinical cases, the regenerative process often appears to be arrested altogether. In experimental trials of anemia induced experimentally through whole blood removal, metarubricytosis increases to only 20 per 100 white blood cells (WBCs; high normal = 3 per 100 WBCs), and reticulocytosis increases to only 1.5% (high normal = 0.6%).55, 56 Some individual animals on these experimental trials remained anemic for at least 3 months in spite of having no known reason for suppressed regeneration.

In most cases, the mechanism of anemia is difficult to verify, and erythrocyte indices are within reference ranges. Blood loss may be external or internal, with internal parasites such as Mycoplasma haemolamae, Eimeria, liver flukes, and gastric nematodes the most common culprits.57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71 The importance of Haemonchus contortus, in particular, has been recognized in recent years, particularly with increasing concerns of anthelmintic resistance among GI nematodes. Haemonchosis is the most common cause in our area for PCV less than 10% in camelids; GI neoplasms, and mycoplasmosis are rarer causes. External examination for wounds, lice, ticks, and lymphadenopathy, fecal examination for internal parasites, and blood film examination for mycoplasmosis should be performed in cases of unexplained anemia, and bone marrow analysis should be considered with chronic anemia. Fluorescent staining methods are used to distinguish Haemonchus from other strongyle-type egg producers (see Chapter 5). It also must be kept in mind that blood-sucking by Haemonchus females starts with the L4 larvae, meaning that anemia can occur during the prepatent period. Each female worm ingests approximately 0.05 ml of blood per day; every 1000 worms ingest approximately 1.4% of an adult alpaca's blood volume each day. Other internal parasites are rarely associated with anemia of this severity, but are commonly seen in camelids with PCV between around 15% and 25%. Significant non-parasitic GI bleeding has been seen with lymphoma or carcinoma, ulcerative gastritis caused by ingestion of sand or hair, and copper poisoning. Unless compounded by one of these other factors, gastric ulceration extremely rarely leads to anemia, melena, or even a positive fecal occult blood test. Renal blood loss may occur with neoplasms or chronic nephritis. Significant bleeding may lead to overt hematuria.",

They attach to the wall of erythrocytes with microfibrils, causing slight depressions at the site of adherence, but do not appear to penetrate host cells. They are presumed to cause disease through glucose consumption, activation of an inflammatory or immune response, and accelerated removal of parasitized erythrocytes by the reticuloendothelial system. Prevalence of infection in various populations has been estimated to range from approximately 10% to 20%.62, 67, 68 The mode of transmission is unknown. Biting insects may play a role, and the identification of infection in presuckling neonates suggests that vertical transmission may also occur.63\n",

If one infected camelid is identified in a herd, it is likely that others are infected as well, often with varying degrees of illness, including some in apparent good health. It has been seen in camelids of all ages, including neonates less than 1 day old.63 Those that are ill may show anything from mild signs, including progressive lethargy, recumbency, and weight loss, to acute collapse and death. Advanced clinical signs often correlate with high levels of parasitemia and anemia but also may be the result of some concurrent disorder. The interplay between mycoplasmosis and other disease is an ongoing question. Immunosuppression is thought to facilitate severe parasitemia but may also be the result of parasitemia. Camelids showing severe anemia or signs should generally be investigated for the presence of another disorder such as immunodeficiency, and treatment of that disorder should accompany any treatment for mycoplasmosis. Specific factors identified as contributing to heavy parasitemia include weather stress, heavy GI parasite loads, immune suppression or deficiency (juvenile llama immunodeficiency syndrome, corticosteroid administration, Anaplasma phagocytophilum infection, or debilitation caused by another disease.60, 65, 69\n",

Mild to moderate anemia may require no additional treatment beyond addressing what is perceived to be the causative disorder. However, the persistence of anemia after the insult is gone is troubling and may indicate the need for some intervention. Modest interventions include dietary mineral supplements, high-quality nutrition, and an effective parasite control strategy. Iron dextran (5\u20138 mg/kg, SQ, q 7 to 14 days) may be administered as outlined above; injectable iron supplements are likely to be more useful than oral iron in deficient animals.

This challenge was complicated by the lack of knowledge or tools available to investigate camelid immune function at the time of presumptive peak prevalence of JLIDS. The disease was initially defined by lack of sufficient antibody response to vaccination against Clostridium perfringens types C and D. Unfortunately, that test is not currently available for camelids, to our knowledge, and a major attempt to screen a large healthy llama population using this technique failed to reveal new cases. Flow cytometric studies by a different group suggested that camelids with JLIDS have extremely low circulating B-cell counts and led to the suggestion of an autosomal recessive genetic defect, but the use of flow cytometry to identify new cases prospectively has not been reported.89 A reduced stimulation index to Streptococcus protein A on lymphocyte blastogenesis assay also supports the role of B-cell dysfunction.86\n",

Some camelids also develop pleural or peritoneal effusions that may contain neoplastic cells. Cytologic examination of bone marrow may be useful for diagnosing the neoplasm in camelids without palpable lymphadenopathy, and examination of the cerebrospinal fluid may be helpful in camelids with neurologic deficits. Definitive diagnosis is made through histopathologic examination of tissue or cytologic evaluation of a body fluid. Tru-cut biopsy samples are sufficient, whereas interpretation of fine-needle aspirates is often problematic because of poor preservation of neoplastic cells. The biopsy should be taken from a peripheral mass or, if necessary, from an internal organ. Usually, the tumors occur in multiple sites, including lymph nodes, liver, renal cortices, spleen, lungs, heart, bone marrow, gastrointestinal organs, uterus, and the spinal canal.

Many mammalian hosts are susceptible, especially grazing species, with rare infections also identified in humans. The principal reservoir appears to be within abscesses in infected animals.

Contamination may occur directly from draining wounds or contaminated exhalations or milk, from the environment, where the organism may persist a year or more, or potentially through fly spread in a contaminated environment. Skin breaks during shearing are thought to be an important means of initiating infection in small ruminants and are likely to promote spread from infected small ruminants to camelids or within an infected herd of camelids as well, but the disease has been found in young camelids that have never been shorn.108, 109 Other skin wounds, such as ear tag or microchip sites or traumatic injuries, may facilitate infection as well.

In camelids, individual animal treatments are more common. Affected camelids should be isolated, especially if they have open wounds or a draining mammary abscess. When possible, subcutaneous abscesses should be removed en bloc. It this is not possible, they may be opened and cleaned frequently with disinfectants. On the basis of South American data, ultrasonographic or cross-sectional imaging of the perirenal lymph node area should be considered, as these tests would have the highest likelihood of finding an internal mass. The mammary gland should also be examined closely in female camelids. Antibiotics should be considered, particularly those of the penicillin class. However, although C. pseudotuberculosis may appear sensitive to many antibiotics in the laboratory, clinical response is often poor. Intracellular or intrabscess reservoirs and growth in biofilms appear to afford protection. Over the time of treatment, which may last several weeks in an individual, additional abscesses may arise on affected animals or herdmates, so they should be monitored carefully. If no new abscesses have arisen for at least 3 months, additional masses appear unlikely in North American herds. If animals have no internal masses, they are likely to thrive after resolution; if internal lesions are present, unthriftiness may continue or develop.

These infections may be caused by aggressive agents such as Salmonella, Listeria, Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus, or more commonly, by opportunistic organisms taking advantage of a weakened immune system or compromised skin or mucosal boundary.113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121\nStreptococcus appears to be the most common primary pathogen, and Escherichia coli and Clostridium are the most common opportunists. The role of the opportunist is important to recognize for two reasons: (1) Camelids with generalized sepsis may have an underlying condition requiring specific diagnostic tests and treatment, and (2) the development of sepsis in a camelid with another disorder often leads to a worsening of signs and prognosis and usually requires aggressive specific treatment for sepsis.",

A very low serum iron concentration is a fairly specific indicator of acute sepsis, but iron is not part of many standard chemistry panels. Hematologic abnormalities are also variable. High peripheral blood counts of immature neutrophils or those with toxic changes are relatively specific to sepsis. Neutropenia is also a fairly good indicator (for an exception, see \u201cMyelodysplasia\u201d earlier in this chapter), with the understanding that it may be masked initially by the animal's stress response.

Collection of blood, abdominal fluid, thoracic fluid, or cerebrospinal fluid may be indicated either by specific signs or a thorough general workup. Culture of the organism allows for sensitivity analysis. Sometimes, the organisms are seen on cytologic examination but do not grow in culture. Antibiotic selection in such cases becomes a matter of educated guesswork. With all types of bacteria implicated in sepsis, initial antibiotic choice should provide broad-spectrum coverage, including anaerobes. Combinations of a penicillin-class drug and an aminoglycoside are the most popular protocol, once the camelid is adequately hydrated. Other treatments may include general supportive care, fluids, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications, or endotoxin binders, as needed, as well as appropriate treatment for organ specific signs or underlying diseases. Prognosis is better if sepsis is acute, the camelid still appears principally fit, and any underlying process is temporary. It is worse with drawn out diseases, weak or recumbent camelids, or those showing major dysfunction of any particular organ system.

These concerns were originally based on evidence of seroconversion in camelids in South America and the occurrence of vague illnesses, including apparent immunodeficiency, in North America.129, 130 Of further concern was the increasing knowledge that nonruminant hosts such as the white-tailed deer could serve as BVDV vectors and reservoirs.131 BVDV was isolated on rare occasions from llamas and alpacas with upper respiratory infections, diarrhea, or ill-thrift, and linked through maternal or fetal titers to reproductive failures.131, 132, 133 These infections appeared to be transient, leading to short-term seroconversion and viral shedding. Experimental efforts to model the disease through intranasal infections with various strains of BVDV including type 1a, type 1b, and type 2, consistently revealed that adult camelids developed viremia and nasal shedding after infection but that these were transient, lasting less than 10 to 13 days, and accompanied by minimal to no clinical signs.134, 135 Concerns about persistence of infection in camelid herds, particularly in association with reproductive failures, and supported by the 2002 report of isolation of BVDV type 1b from a fetus, could not be substantiated using BVD Type 1a.134, 136 On the basis of these findings, each incident of natural infection was presumed to arise from a new cross-over event from a ruminant or other noncamelid host.",

Persistent infection to BVDV develops in the bovine fetus when its dam has viremia at some point between approximately day 40 and day 125 of pregnancy. A similar exposure window is postulated for camelids, with presumptive infection occurring around 65 to 70 days of pregnancy in some reports, around 70 to 80 days in one experimental trial, and between 64 and 114 days during one outbreak.137, 138, 144, 145 Infections before that period may lead to embryonic death and infection after that period may lead to abortion, stillbirth, or premature underweight birth, and it is possible that the window for development of persistent infection is wider than has been confirmed experimentally. If the fetus is infected during the appropriate window, it also develops viremia and widespread tissue distribution of the virus but does not develop an antibody titer. It remains infected lifelong, potentially suffering illness and also serving as a source of infection for herdmates. To date, over 60 crias in the United States are thought to have been born persistently infected. In one study, 25% of the tested U.S. alpaca herds had at least one seropositive cria, and 6% had at least one persistently infected cria, indicating that exposure to BVDV is relatively common and that the risk for developing persistently infected crias is real.146\n",

These same tests plus immunohistochemistry may be used on tissues from a dead animal or aborted fetus, including the placenta. A rise in antibody titer or the presence of a positive titer in an unvaccinated camelid may also be used as evidence of exposure; titers usually persist longer than the viremia required for PCR or virus isolation.

The unintentional introduction of persistently infected animals into a herd has been surmised to be the cause of several outbreaks.137, 140, 145 Virus isolation or PCR on whole blood are the most common tests, with PCR usually preferable because of faster turn-around times and less danger of sample mishandling. False-negative results on these tests have arisen from true neonates, in which maternal antibody is thought to interfere for up to 12 weeks, particularly with virus isolation. Serologic tests often yield negative results from persistently infected animals but are often positive in herdmates, especially the dam and other contact animals. Some crias with seropositivity may be chronically infected and thus may serve as a source of infection for herdmates.145 Serologic testing of representative animals is a good initial screening test for whether a herd has been exposed or not. Ear-notch immunohistochemistry is positive in some cases. Postmortem tests are the same as in acutely infected animals except that the virus is usually more widespread. The conventional definition of persistent infection includes two positive PCR or virus isolation tests taken at least 3 weeks apart and without evidence of a serologic response (barring that caused by colostral antibody), but chronically infected crias complicate that definition.",
