Once available, vaccine is gradually produced, evoking the question on how to distribute it best. While official vaccination guidelines largely focus on the question to whom vaccines should be provided first (e.g. to risk groups), here we propose a generic strategy for their distribution in time and space, which sequentially prioritizes regions with a high local infection growth rate. To demonstrate this strategy, we develop an agent-based model describing the time-evolution of infection patterns and their response to vaccination. For heterogeneous infection patterns, the proposed strategy at least halves the number of deaths in our simulations compared to the standard practice of distributing vaccines proportionally to the population density. This applies for a wide range of reproduction numbers and vaccine production rates and might stimulate discussions on the importance of the spatiotemporal distribution of vaccines for official guidelines. * hlowen@hhu.de \u2020",

            "text": "Introduction The Covid-19 pandemic 2019/2020 [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] has led to more than 3 million infections and 200.000 deaths worldwide (early May 2020) [6, 7] and an unprecedented social and economic cost which comprises a sudden rise of the unemployment rate by about 30 million in the USA alone, and a damage of trillions of dollars at the stock market and in the worldwide real economy. This situation challenges politicians to decide on suitable measures and researchers to explore their efficiency, based on models allowing to forecast and compare the evolution of infectious diseases (like when taking one or the other action. Available measures to efficiently deal with epidemic outbreaks at low infection numbers include a rigorous contact-tracing (e.g. based on \"Corona-Apps\" [8] ) and -testing combined with quarantine of infected individuals [9] [10] [11] [12] . Strict travel restrictions preventing an infectious disease from entering disease-free regions (or to die out locally [13] ) present an alternative measure [14, 15] , whereas travel reductions by less than \u223c 99% [16] slow down the spreading of the disease only slightly [16] [17] [18] . At higher infection numbers reducing the contact rate through measures broadly affecting a population's everyday life, such as social distancing [10, 12, [19] [20] [21] [22] and lockdown [12, 23] , remains as the only possibility to avoid an explosion of infection numbers. Unless a population persistently reduces the contact rate to the point where infection numbers decrease (this requires a contact reduction by > 60% for a basic reproduction number of R 0 = 2.5 [21] ), at such stages it has to accept that the majority of its members has to endure the disease -until finally reaching herd immunity [24] . The main hope which remains at such stages rests on the rapid discovery and admission of vaccine [25] to accelerate reaching herd immunity. However, while every day where an infectious disease like Covid-19 is active may cause thousands of additional deaths, even after admission, it may take months until sufficient vaccine is available to overcome an infectious disease. Therefore it is important to strategically distribute the available vaccines such that the number of deaths remains as small as possible. Surprisingly, both official vaccination guidelines, e.g. for pandemic influenza [26, 27] , and previous works on vaccine distribution [28] [29] [30] , focus on the question to whom vaccine should be mainly provided, e.g. to prioritize individuals by age or disease risk, and leave the quest for a suitable spatial and temporal vaccine distribution aside. This results in the common practice of simply distributing vaccines proportionally to the population density [31] . In the present work we propose an alternative strategy for the spatiotemporal distribution of gradually produced vaccines, which hinges on the idea that the number of deaths due to a spreading infectious disease is controlled by the pattern of local infection rates, not by population density. This strategy, which we call the \"focusing strategy\", sequentially prioritizes regions (cities) with the highest growth rates of the local infection numbers (see Fig. 1 and the supplementary movie) and provides, or \"focuses\", all available vaccines to those regions. To compare the focusing strategy with the standard \"demographic\" vaccine distribution practice, we develop an agent-based model describing the time-evolution of an epidemic outbreak (such as and its response to vaccination. As our central result, we find that the number of deaths resulting from infections occurring after the onset of vaccine production is generally smaller when following the focusing strategy rather than the demographic distribution practice. In fact, for heterogeneous infection patterns, the focusing strategy reduces the number of deaths by more than a factor of two, for a large range of shows the standard \"demographic strategy\", where vaccines (dosage needles) are continuously distributed among all regions (e.g. cities) proportionally to their population density (dots represent groups of individuals). b) shows the \"infection weighted\" strategy, where vaccines are distributed proportionally to the local infection rates (red and orange dots) and c) shows the \"focusing strategy\" where at early times (clocks) only the region with the largest infection rate receives vaccines until the growth rate of a second region catches up and also receives vaccines. d) shows a typical simulation snapshot for a city size distribution following Zipf's law taken 42 days after the onset of vaccination when following the focusing strategy. The legend below a)-c) shows the states in our model. basic reproduction numbers R 0 and vaccine production rates. The difference is largest for R 0 \u223c 2 \u2212 3, as typical for Covid-19, but even for R 0 \u223c 1 and in the presence of additional social distancing rules the focusing strategy significantly increases the survival probability.",

Let us assume that vaccine production starts after some initial transient and then allows to transfer \u03bd individuals per day from the susceptible to the immune state. (Note that the duration of the initial transient is unimportant in our simulations, if vaccination starts long before herd immunity is reached.) Now considering the time-evolution of the percentage of infected, dead and recovered individuals of a given population, and distributing the available vaccines proportionally to the population density (bronze curves in Fig. 2 ), we observe an infection maximum (panel a) about 30 days (two infection cycles) after the onset of vaccine production, i.e. when about 22% of the population have received vaccines and 2% of the population is infected. When distributing the available vaccines proportionally to the local infection rate (\"infection weighted strategy\") instead, notably, the infection maximum occurs an entire infection cycle earlier (silver curve in panel a). Here the infection number peaks when only 11% of the population has received vaccines and only 1% is infected. However, the infection weighted strategy is not optimal but can be further improved by exclusively providing all available vaccines to the region (e.g. a city) with the highest infection rate (\"focusing strategy\"). This means that initially only a single region receives vaccines until the infection rate of a second region catches up and both regions simultaneously receive vaccines, until a third region catches up and so on. Following this \"focusing strategy\" the infection peak further shifts to earlier times (golden curve in panel a) and occurs when only 0.6% of the population is infected. Importantly, the resulting fraction of deaths reduces by more than a factor of two when following the infection weighted strategy (silver) rather than the demographic strategy (bronze). It almost halves again when follow- ing the focusing strategy instead (gold). This shows that the precise spatial and temporal order of vaccine donation controls the number of survivors from an infectious disease. In the methods section we develop a continuum theory complementing our agent based simulations and confirming the importance of the spatiotemporal vaccine distribution at very large scales.",

Mathematically, this is because vaccination is most efficient at locations where it maximally reduces the infection growth rate, which holds true independently of the specific parameter regime. The differences among the individual strategies is comparatively large if vaccine is produced fast enough to allow vaccinating at least about 1% of the population per day and at reproduction rates around R 0 \u223c 2 \u2212 3. The latter value might be sensible for Covid-19.

To generate a population featuring a corresponding population distribution, we add an external potential U to the equation of motion of the agents (see Methods for details). Following statistical mechanics, the resulting population density follows Boltzmann's law P (r) \u221d exp[\u2212U (r)/(kT )] where P (r) is the probability that an agent is at position r and kT = \u03b3D is the effective thermal energy of the agents, controlling how often agents leave a \"city\" (minimum of U ). Now matching Boltzmann's distribution with Zipf's law yields a construction rule for U (see Methods) to create a population pattern featuring a characteristic city-size distribution. Our resulting simulations, shown in Fig. 4b , and in the supplementary movie (for N = 55.000 agents), demonstrate that the focusing strategy and the infection weighted-strategy again halve the number of deaths compared to the demographic strategy. Here, the former two strategies are comparatively close to each other regarding the number of resulting deaths, which indicates that in strongly inhomogeneous populations a suitable spatial vaccine distribution rule might be even more important than the precise temporal sequence of vaccine donation.",

Such a strong difference occurs for a large range of initial reproduction numbers (R 0 \u223c 1.5 \u2212 4) and vaccine production rates and even in combination with additional social distancing measures, if the underlying infection pattern is sufficiently heterogeneous and vaccine production starts long before the population reaches herd immunity.

Integrating this model, e.g. by using finite difference simulations allows us to test the spatiotemporal vaccination strategies at the continuum level. This is particularly useful to study very large length and timescales. The continuum description is based on equations of motion for continuous variables (fields) representing the mean number density of susceptible agents S(r, t), exposed agents E(r, t) (infected but not yet diseased), infected agents which are free of symptoms (or have mild symptoms) F (r, t), infected agents with symptoms I(r, t) and recovered (immune) agents G(r, t):",

In the above equations, \u03b2 is the infection rate, i.e. 1/\u03b2 is the mean time between infectious contacts; \u03b1 = 1/t L is the rate to switch from the exposed (latent) state to the infected state, \u03b4 = 1/(t D \u2212 t L ) is the recovery rate and \u03bd (r, t) is the spatiotemporal vaccination rate which is linked to the constant vaccination rate in the agent-based model via \u03bd = dr \u03bd (r, t). The number r is the ratio of infections proceeding symptom free (or with mild symptoms) and \u03c1 0 = N/L 2 is the mean agent density. Finally, D is the diffusion coefficient and f (r) = \u2212\u2207 r U/\u03b3 is the reduced force due to the external potential which we use to create a density profile mimicking a typical city size distribution. The overall density converges to a Boltzmann distribution S + E + F + I + G = N exp[\u2212U (r)/(kT )]/ exp[\u2212U (r)/(kT )]dr, yielding the conservation law (S + E + F + I + G) dr = N which can be viewed as an expression of the conservation of the overall number density (or the number of agents) in the coarse of the dynamics. We have simulated this model using the finite difference method, starting with the initial state E = F = G = 0 and S = 1 \u2212 , I = where (r, t) represents a small perturbation of the unstable steady state E = F = G = I = 0, S = 1 which represents the population before the emergence of the disease. The results of these simulations confirm that the spatiotemporal distribution of continously distributed vaccines plays an important role; also here, the infection-weighted strategy and the focusing strategy strongly increase the number of survivors as compared to the demographic distribution.",
