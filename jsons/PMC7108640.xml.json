For example, if ferrets are approached while sleeping, it often takes approximately 15 to 30 sec for them to become fully roused. To an inexperienced observer, it may initially appear that the ferret is severely depressed or even comatose. However, this behavior should be considered normal unless it persists. In addition, ferrets often express a shivering behavior that does not necessarily indicate ill health. Although the reason for this behavior is unknown, it may be observed when the ferret awakens from sleep or becomes excited. Finally, if a ferret is restrained by the scruff of the neck, it will often yawn as its body relaxes. Again, the significance of this particular behavioral response is unknown, but handlers should be aware that it is normal (Boyce et al. 2001).",

Ferrets normally maintain an arched position with their backs, typical of other mustelids such as weasels. When weak or lethargic, regardless of cause, ferrets will lose this arch causing the back to become parallel with the horizontal plane. This posture results in some degree of ataxia of the rear quarters and may be a nonspecific sign.

When the light cycle is reversed to produce a long day photoperiod, breeding activities are initiated.

For example, when ferrets are used in an acute surgical procedure, it may be necessary to handle them only for a preanesthetic physical examination and for injection of a sedative or anesthetic induction agent. For survival surgery, especially for major invasive procedures, extensive handling is required, which includes preoperative blood work and daily postoperative observations and treatments. Regardless, the key to successful nonstressful handling is acclimation of the ferret to whatever method of restraint will be required. This goal should be accomplished well in advance of initiation of the experimental procedure. Otherwise, especially with young ferrets, their rambunctious behavior may make handling difficult.",

As stated above (see Physical Examination), this method of restraint often produces a relaxation response that is accompanied by a yawn.

Another effective and nonstressful method of restraint involves tucking the ferret \u201chead first\u201d against one's waist using the crook of one's arm.

Caging systems are readily accessible either commercially or through modification of pre-existing equipment. Knowledge of ferret behavior will guide the use of social housing and environmental enrichment devices that encourage species-typical behaviors. High-quality ferret diets are commercially available and satisfy the unique nutritional needs of ferrets, including young or pregnant animals. As with other conventionally reared species, a good health care program is composed of an immunization protocol, routine health assessments, and knowledge of common ferret diseases. If breeding the animals is required for the research, all aspects of ferret breeding may be successfully accomplished in the laboratory with sufficient training in the particulars of ferret reproductive biology.",
