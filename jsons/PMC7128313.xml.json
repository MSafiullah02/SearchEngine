Three pandemic influenza A viruses emerged in the 20th century\u2014the \u201cSpanish influenza\u201d A (H1N1) virus in 1918, the \u201cAsian influenza\u201d A (H2N2) virus in 1957, and the \u201cHong Kong influenza\u201d A (H3N2) virus in 1968. All three pandemics spread rapidly around the world; however, only the 1918 virus was associated with a high mortality, killing an estimated 20 to 50 million people worldwide (Belshe, 2005). The latest outbreaks of avian A (H5N1) influenza in Asia, Europe, and Africa have scientists concerned that the currently circulating, highly pathogenic A (H5N1) avian influenza virus could emerge to be as deadly as the 1918 influenza A virus (Holmes et al 2005, Stohr 2005, Taubenberger et al 2005).",

For example, antigenic drift (see Figure 3), a gradual genetic change in the virus, requires a new vaccine against currently circulating influenza A (and B) viruses each influenza season (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [NIAID], 2006a). Avian viruses, which are different than seasonal influenza A viruses, generally must mutate or adapt to humans through an intermediate host before there can be transmission to humans. This is known as antigenic shift, which is an abrupt change in the hemagglutinin or neuraminidase of the virus and results in a new subtype of influenza A. Antigenic shift can occur in one of three ways: (a) from wild waterfowl to humans through genetic change in an intermediate host such as a chicken or pig, and a human virus infects the intermediate host at the same time (reassortment); (b) directly from waterfowl to humans without genetic change; or (c) from waterfowl to an intermediate host without genetic change (see Figure 4). A new subtype of influenza A virus may further evolve to spread from human to human. If this occurs, a pandemic virus to which humans have no immunity can emerge (NIAID, 2006a).",

However, in 1997 an epidemic of A (H5N1) influenza in humans was reported in Hong Kong with 18 confirmed cases and 6 deaths. This was the first time transmission of an avian influenza virus directly from infected domestic birds to humans had been reported. A second outbreak among live bird markets was reported again in Hong Kong in 2001, but no human cases occurred because of swift action by the Hong Kong government to cull infected chickens and remove the source of the virus. In 2003, highly pathogenic A (H5N1) appeared again in China and Hong Kong. Two cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) infection occurred among members of a Hong Kong family that had traveled to China. One person recovered, the other died. It was not determined how or where these two family members were infected, but another family member died of an undiagnosed respiratory illness in China. Unfortunately, no testing was done on this latter family member (CDC, 2006).",

            "text": "Of all influenza viruses that circulate in birds, the A (H5N1) virus is currently of greatest concern for two reasons. First, the latest outbreaks of the virus have caused by far the greatest number of human cases of very severe disease and the greatest number of deaths. It has crossed the species barrier to infect humans on at least three occasions in recent years. The current reemergence of avian A (H5N1) influenza began in China and Hong Kong in 2003, with at least 2 human cases and 1 death. The virus also emerged in Southeast Asia in 2003 and spread rapidly among domestic poultry. In December 2003, the first human cases associated with the Southeast Asia outbreak occurred in Vietnam. A year later there were 46 human cases of A (H5N1) with 32 deaths. By 2005, the virus had spread to other parts of Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East (WHO, 2006e). As of October 2006, the WHO reported a total of 256 human cases of A (H5N1) influenza in Asia, Europe, and Africa (Egypt), with 152 deaths (59% fatality rate). Nearly two thirds (64%) of these cases have occurred in Vietnam (n = 93) and Indonesia (n = 72). The majority of the human cases (72%, n = 109) and 49% of deaths (n = 74) to date have occurred in 2006 alone (WHO, 2006b).",

To date, human-to-human transmission has been questioned in rare cases (Ungchusak et al., 2005). To date, the evidence indicates that close contact with dead or sick birds or their droppings is the principal source of human infection with the A (H5N1) virus. Nonetheless, avian influenza H5N1 has pandemic potential because it might ultimately adapt into a strain that is contagious among humans. Once this adaptation occurs, it will no longer be a bird virus\u2014it will be a human influenza virus to which there is no immunity (WHO, 2006f). Because of the concerns regarding the aggressive spread of the A (H5N1) virus between 2003 and 2005, in November 2005 the WHO declared a Phase 3 pandemic alert: a new influenza virus subtype is causing disease in humans, but is not yet sustainable and spreading efficiently among humans (see Figure 3) (WHO, 2006d).",

However, when a pandemic begins, a vaccine may not yet be available, and the supply of antiviral drugs may be limited. Therefore, application of infection control measures during a pandemic is essential. Pandemic influenza infection control practices in health care settings are similar to those outlined previously for avian influenza. Specific recommendations can be located on the DHHS website at http://www.hhs.gov/pandemicflu/plan/sup4.html#s4-IV.",

            "text": "Influenza pandemics are inevitable. Many experts believe that the SARS outbreaks in 2003 were a prologue to the next flu pandemic, possibly from an avian influenza virus (Stohr, 2005). Since the SARS outbreaks, serious concerns about the extent to which health care providers would tolerate risks of infection have been raised (Ruderman et al, 2006). Nonetheless, the expertise of health care providers is an integral part of the response to a pandemic. No other profession can be legitimately expected to fulfill this role and to assume this level of risk (Ruderman et al., 2006). Health care providers can be prepared for avian influenza and a potential pandemic by becoming familiar with the lessons learned from the SARS outbreaks such as case detection, reporting, clear and timely dissemination of information, and strict infection control measures in handling an infectious disease outbreak and the procedures that prevented the spread of SARS virus (Abdullah et al 2003, Weinstein, 2005). HIV/AIDS has taught us the importance of remaining vigilant to the devastation of naturally arising epidemics, which can have profound effects not only on individuals, but also on whole nations and regions. The economic and social disruption that often follows an infectious disease outbreak \u2026 can be a major destabilizing force for any nation. The challenge is to keep our concerns and responses in reasonable balance. We must also understand that factors in society, the environment, and our global interconnectedness actually increase the likelihood of the ongoing emergence and spread of infectious diseases (Institute of Medicine, 2005, pp. 2-3).\n",
