We developed an online teaching implementation plan covering components of teaching delivery, online classes management and supervision, and learning assessment. Faculty are encouraged to choose appropriate learning platforms they are familiar with. In order to support faculty in their work, we developed five actions: 1. A line-up of main online education platforms were introduced to all faculty by email, Wechat discussion groups, and school website. 2. Faculty were encouraged to share their previous experiences with platforms including Blackboard, TronClass, Zoom, Classin, Wechat group, and QQ group. 3. School of Educational Technology assembled a professional team for providing faculty-wide support. The team shared their knowledge and skills about different platforms and conducted online training. Further, professional companies were invited to train our faculty on using specific tools. 4. Learning online is a big challenge for our 2,096 students. The team informed students about changes, provided two teaching assistants for each online class, and ensured that every student is able to participate in digital learning. Special attention was given to students coming from poor regions and difficult family backgrounds. 5. The team collected information about all online courses, including their delivery platform, class size, schedule, and student readiness. Few classes were selected for trial lessons at a variety of platforms with the aim to pilot online learning strategies before their large-scale implementation.",

            "text": "Following these activities, on Feb 24, Faculty of Education successfully implemented 307 courses through online systems, 15 of which are aimed at international students and taught in English. This involves over 183 faculty and over 2,000 students at all levels including 250 international students. At the moment of writing this article, the transition has been under way for about 6 weeks. Most courses seem successful; students seem to enjoy online learning, and some professors even report that students seem more active than in their physical classrooms. At the research front, we organized a series of webinars which created opportunities for scholars within and beyond China to share their research and thoughts on issues relating to the transition, with the aim to start developing more resilient education systems for the future. Online learning is defined as learning experience in synchronous or asynchronous environments using different devices (e.g. mobile phones, laptops) with Internet access. Using these environments, students can learn and interact with instructors and other students from anywhere (Singh and Thurman 2019) . The easiest part of this transition for Faculty of Education was providing online learning platforms and courses. However, we are meeting some persistent obstacles and challenges. Online course delivery, interaction, and data collection require stabile digital infrastructure and platforms, yet learning of some students across China and overseas is interrupted by poor Internet access. Students require capacity to conduct self-disciplined and self-directed active learning, and faculty require further professional development. Challenges also include lack of holistic quality assurance systems for online teaching and learning. The pandemic has revealed that quality does not refer only to achieving learning outcomes, but also to social and emotional development of students (see Peters et al. forthcoming) .",

Internet, big data, Artificial Intelligence, 5G, and cloud-based platforms, among other technologies, have been put into service of education. However, a more flexible way of teaching and learning does not end up with infrastructure. Rather, infrastructure is only the first step towards a new paradigm of teaching and learning in post-pandemic time. This paradigm could represent a shift from traditional, teacher-centered, and lecturebased activities towards more student-centered activities including group activities, discussions, hands-on learning activities, and limited use of traditional lectures. This requires conceptual and philosophical rethinking of nature of teaching and learning, roles, and connections among teachers, learners, and teaching materials, in postdigital learning communities (Jandri\u0107 et al. 2018) .",

Post-pandemic national teacher education could be composed of face-to-face teacher education, blended teacher education, and online teacher education (Zhu 2020) . National online teacher education could be categorized into sections which provide learning opportunities to future teachers at all levels: early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, vocational education sectors, etc. Online teacher education platforms could function as a traditional teacher education institute which provides pre-service and in-service programs. This could be supported by online platforms with rich digital materials and resources. Curriculum and pedagogy need to be updated, and should become models of successful online pedagogies that could be taken into future teachers' practices. Last but not the least, it is critical to build up an enabling institutional environment for sustainable national online teacher education. We need to develop evidence-based policies supported by guidelines for their implementation. To provide professional reference base for online teacher education, a framework of competencies for conducting online teaching, and other standards, should be developed.",
