Respiratory virus infection outcome is determined by a complex game between the virus and the host, the rules of which are not fully understood, but where the host-response can be more deleterious than the virus itself for inducing lung disease.2 High-throughput methods have been used to globally characterize the host response to IAV and SARS-CoV infections and have revealed that the dynamics and magnitude of the innate immune response to infection, as well as immune cell infiltration, are crucial aspects of pathogenesis.3-5",

There is an increasing number of different classes of these regulatory ncRNAs: small interfering RNA (siRNA), microRNA (miRNA), Piwi\u2010interacting RNA (piRNA), promoter\u2010associated small RNA (PASRs), small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). lncRNAs are endogenous cellular RNAs that are mRNA-like in length (> 200 nt) but which lack any positive-strand open-reading frames longer than 30 amino acids. A recent review estimates the number of total lncRNAs is in the range of \u223c20,000 transcripts, but only about 200 lncRNAs have been characterized to date.6 Known lncRNAs are involved in many complex human diseases and regulate key cellular processes by a variety of molecular mechanisms. Among the most well studied lncRNAs, Xist and Air have been shown to epigenetically silence transcription by targeting chromatin-modifying complexes to particular genes in trans and cis, respectively.7,8 Other lncRNAs act at the post-transcriptional level, such as H19 lncRNA, which serves as the precursor for miR-675 to moderate cell growth,9 and Malat1, which forms a molecular scaffold for several proteins present in nuclear speckles and which regulates pre-mRNA alternative splicing.10",

Differential expression of lncRNA is observed in response to viral infection11 and in immune cells after stimulation or differentiation.12 In particular, we previously observed that 500 annotated and 1,000 novel lncRNAs are differentially expressed in mice after SARS-CoV infection.13 About 40% of these changes were similarly observed in mice and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) infected with influenza virus A/PR/8/34 and in response to interferon (IFN) treatment.13 A few lncRNAs have been functionally studied for their role in viral pathogenesis. For example, Tmevpg1 (also known as NeST), is an antisense transcript distal to IFNG that is involved in Theiler\u2019s virus persistence and decreased Salmonella enterica pathogenesis, and it enhances IFNG gene expression by binding to the histone methyltransferase complex and altering histone 3 methylation at the IFN-\u03b3 locus.14,15\nNeat1 is one of many lncRNAs induced by HIV-1 infection, and it serves as a scaffold for the nuclear paraspeckle substructure that can sequester some mRNAs in the nucleus.16 Importantly, Neat1 deficiency enhances HIV-1 replication.17",

It has been hypothesized that lncRNAs function through their secondary structure rather than through their primary sequence.6 However, there are currently no computational methods to reliably predict a single secondary structure for a single sequence of long RNA,18 which could in turn be used to predict lncRNA function. In addition, minimal lncRNA expression, localization and interactome data are available, which also limits our understanding of lncRNA function. With the large amount of transcriptome data generated by high-throughput technologies, predicting gene function on the basis of expression is an attractive strategy for the characterization of novel or unannotated transcripts.19 One approach for predicting the function of unknown genes is the 'guilt by association' approach, according to which genes with similar expression profiles are functionally associated. This strategy was successfully applied to 340 mouse lncRNAs after re-annotation of the Affymetrix Mouse Array using 34 data sets derived from diverse mouse tissues.20",

Eight mouse strains with large genetic diversity and that constitute the Collaborative Cross (CC) founder strains21 were infected with either mouse-adapted H1N1 influenza virus or with recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV, providing a wide range of host transcriptional responses to two different respiratory viruses. We found that lncRNAs accounted for about 40% of total genes differentially expressed (DE) upon infection. Of these DE lncRNAs, 5,295 were functionally annotated using module-based and rank-based enrichment methods, with universal and ad hoc gene sets. To validate the lncRNAs predicted to be IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the context of respiratory disease, we profiled mouse pulmonary transcriptomic responses after IFN\u03b1 treatment by an independent total RNA-Seq experiment. We anticipate that our lncRNA annotation, entirely available through a user-friendly web interface, MONOCLdb (www.monocldb.org), will accelerate mechanistic characterization of lncRNA function(s) that are of general interest to the infectious disease and immunology fields.",

These eight mouse strains \u2013 A/J, C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ, NOD/ShiLtJ, NZO/HILt, CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ \u2013 represent the founder strains for the CC mouse resource project.21 They were chosen for the CC resource because of their large genetic diversity and they have also been previously shown to have a wide range of susceptibility to PR8 infection.22 Weight loss was monitored daily over the course of infection and we found that the CC founders had a wide range of morbidity after either PR8 or MA15 infection (Fig S2A). We also noted that the strains most susceptible to PR8 infection (C57BL/6J and A/J) were not the most susceptible to infection with MA15. While C57BL/6J and A/J mice lost the most weight at four days post infection [DPI] when infected with PR8, these two strains were regaining weight between three and four DPI when infected with MA15. The two mouse strains most susceptible to MA15 were PWK/PhJ and CAST/EiJ, but these strains had intermediate to low susceptibility to PR8 infection. In addition to the wide range of weight loss, the CC founders also supported PR8 and MA15 viral replication to different levels (Fig S2B). Overall, viral replication was not significantly correlated with weight loss after either MA15 or PR8 infection (Fig S2C). However, when considering samples at four DPI only, there was a significant correlation between weight loss and viral replication (p-value < 0.01), especially after MA15 infection (Fig S2C).",

After normalization and expression-based filtering, the distribution of log2 scaled counts showed that the 12,211 lncRNAs that passed our criteria (see Methods) were generally expressed to a lower level than the 15,355 coding genes, with a median of 8.2 and 5.7 counts (in log2) per coding and non-coding genes, respectively (Fig S4). However, multidimensional scaling (MDS) representation of samples based on lncRNA expression (Fig. 1A) or on coding-gene expression (Fig. 1B) showed that lncRNA expression levels differentiated infection conditions as well as coding gene expression. In addition to clustering by infection condition, samples were clustered based on their genetic background, with three main clusters that were representative of mouse phylogenic origin: M.m. domesticus (WSB/EiJ, NOD/ShiLtJ, NZO/HILt, C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ and A/J), M.m. castaneus (CAST/EiJ) and M.m. musculus (PWK/PhJ) (Fig. 1A). Notably, this clustering was less striking when based on coding-gene expression, with CAST/EiJ samples being closer to M.m. domesticus samples, indicating that lncRNA basal levels might be more strain specific than coding gene expression (Fig. 1B). In addition, the dynamic range of lncRNA expression following either MA15 or PR8 infection was as large as the coding gene expression range, though lncRNA expression levels were more downregulated while coding gene expression levels were more upregulated after infection (Fig. 1C). Finally, we found a large number of genes were DE after either MA15 or PR8 infection, with differences in the magnitude of response that depended on the mouse strain and virus (Fig. 1D). For example, PWK/PhJ mice, which were highly susceptible to MA15 infection, had up to 5,098 DE genes at four DPI but only 869 DE genes after PR8 infection. In contrast, C57BL/6J, WSB/EiJ and 129S1/SvImJ mice had more DE genes after PR8 infection compared with MA15 infection at four DPI, with, for example, 5,986 DE genes after PR8 infection of 129S1/SvImJ mice but only 926 genes after MA15 infection.",

We first evaluated several parametric and non-parametric methods, including Pearson, Spearman, Kendall, maximal information coefficient (MIC), Hoeffding, distance correlation (dcor) and biweight midcorrelation (bicor) to determine the optimal method for detecting co-expressed coding genes sharing similar function (Supplemental material and Fig S6). The signed bicor metric outperformed other methods, especially for associating coding genes belonging to similar reactome pathways (Fig S6). We then computed pairwise correlation between DE genes using the signed bicor. We compared the distribution of bicor coefficient between pairs of lncRNAs or pairs of coding genes, or mixed pairs of coding and non-coding genes (Fig S7). The median bicor coefficient was similar between pairs of lncRNAs and coding genes, and coding genes were more likely to be strongly correlated together than were pairs of lncRNAs. On the other hand, a higher number of mixed pairs of coding and non-coding genes were highly negatively correlated than \u201cpure\u201d pairs of coding genes or of lncRNAs (Fig S7), consistent with their different trend of regulation after infection. Based on these pairwise correlations, a complete weighted network was inferred and 11 modules comprised of tightly co-expressed coding and non-coding genes were detected. These modules were classified arbitrarily by color names. Figure 2A shows that within each module, gene expression levels changed very similarly after infection. Whereas the brown and salmon modules included 95% of coding genes or 94% of lncRNAs (respectively), the other modules included both coding genes and lncRNAs that were strongly co-expressed (Fig. 2B).",

The rationale for using Immgen and GeneAtlas gene-sets is that immune cells infiltrating the lungs contribute to respiratory virus pathogenesis and account for a large part of the pulmonary transcriptomic response observed after infection.3 Therefore, we specifically determined whether co-expressed genes in immune cells (Immgen) or genes predominantly expressed in immune cells compared with lung epithelial cells (GeneAtlas) were enriched in each module. In addition, modules were also correlated with weight loss data and viral replication to determine their relevance during infection (Table 1). Enrichment for each module is described in Suppl Text. Some modules had specific expression patterns, depending on the mouse strain and infecting virus. For example, the green module, which was enriched in cytoskeleton and epithelial cilium functions, was specifically correlated with PR8 viral replication and was downregulated after PR8 infection in all founders except for NZO/HILt mice, which were resistant to PR8 infection (Fig S8). The turquoise module was the largest upregulated module, with 1,331 lncRNAs and 1,664 coding genes highly upregulated to different extents in all eight founders infected with either PR8 or MA15 (Fig. 2A-B). This module was highly enriched in ISGs and inflammatory/IFN related pathways, and enriched in genes with promoters containing the ISGF3 binding motif. The turquoise module was also the most highly correlated module with viral replication following either MA15 or PR8 infection.",

In constrast to lncRNAs, there was no coding gene negatively correlated with all of its neighbor genes or with sense neighbor genes. However, similar to cis enhancer-like lncRNA, most of the cis enhancer-like coding genes had one coding gene neighbor while most of the trans coding genes had two or three coding gene neighbors (sense and both strands, respectively) (Fig S10). The specificity of correlation with neighbor coding genes of lncRNAs with more than two neighbor coding genes was determined by PAGE (Fig. 4B). We found that enhancer-like cis lncRNAs were more specifically and strongly associated with coding neighbor genes than potential cis inhibitors (Fig. 4B, Fig S11). However, we did not find any cis-acting lncRNA specifically associated only with its neighbor coding genes, indicating that it might be difficult to untangle direct and indirect effects of cis-acting lncRNAs from in vivo experiments. Figure 4C depicts the expression values for a cis enhancer-like lncRNA, n265841, and its sense and antisense coding neighbors, and an example of a cis inhibitor lncRNA, n287111, and its coding neighbor.",

There was good agreement between the two methods, with lncRNAs mostly associated with ISGs belonging to the turquoise module (Fig. 5A and B). To validate our functional predictions, we performed an independent experiment by treating C57BL/6J mice with IFN-\u03b1. Whole transcriptome pulmonary responses were determined at 12 h post-treatment by total RNA-Seq and statistical analysis was performed to identify DE coding and non-coding genes in IFN-\u03b1 treated mice compared with mock treated mice. We did not observe any immune cell infiltration by hematoxylin and eosin staining at this time point (data not shown) and significantly induced genes were consequently defined as ISGs. In our experimental conditions at 12 h post-treatment, we found only 240 significantly upregulated genes after IFN treatment, including 187 coding genes and 53 lncRNAs. lncRNAs that were upregulated after IFN treatment, depicted in black in Figure 5C, were significantly enriched in the top of the list of predicted IFN-stimulated lncRNAs. Other predicted IFN-stimulated lncRNAs that were not found DE in the lungs of IFN-treated C57BL/6J mice were mostly upregulated but did not pass the statistical threshold (Fig. 5D). It is possible that these lncRNAs would be more upregulated following IFN treatment of other CC founder strains. Finally, the top predicted IFN-stimulated lncRNAs (i.e., lncRNA with lowest p-values of enrichment in ISG = in the lowest PR for enrichment in ISG) were the most significantly highly induced after IFN treatment (Fig. 5D). This indicates that p-values of enrichment (or PR) were predictive of function and that a higher confidence in functional annotation should be placed in enrichment within lower PR.",

Using a \u2018guilt-by-association\u2019 approach to annotation, 5,295 lncRNAs were characterized by at least one gene set. This greatly expands the work of Liao et al., who used similar methods to characterize the lncRNAs present on the Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 array and to annotate 340 mouse lncRNAs based on their expression in 34 data sets.20 While Liao et al. included diverse tissues and biological conditions, they did not include viral infection and had only one data set derived from a bacterial infection (Aeromonas spp. infected intestinal cells). In the present study, we focused on characterizing lncRNAs that were involved in respiratory virus pathogenesis. In terms of methodology, we used both a module-based and a rank-based annotation. However, whereas Liao et al. only considered the top 0.05 percentile first degree of each lncRNA for their \u201chub-based method,\u201d we did not threshold the correlated genes but rather used the whole weighted network by performing a ranked functional enrichment for each lncRNA.

            "text": "It is important to note that we were able to annotate lncRNA functions in the context of respiratory infection thanks to the diverse response of the CC founder mice to SARS-CoV and IAV infection. We observed that the eight CC founder mice had a large range of phenotypic response to infection, associated with a large difference in the magnitude of the transcriptomic response. We have previously shown that NZO/HILt and PWK/PhJ resistance to PR8 infection was due to the dominant gene Mx1, that acts in the context of IAV infection but not SARS-CoV infection.22 The present study sheds light on other genes that may be involved in IAV and SARS-CoV susceptibility. Specifically, 34 of 210 lncRNAs that were found in regions controlling SARS-CoV [Gralinski et al., in preparation], and 53 of 296 lncRNAs in regions controlling IAV resistance,22 were DE. None of these lncRNAs has been previously functionally described. Among this very rich list, an interesting lncRNA to further explore is n268833 (AK142945), which belongs to the QTL HrI2 (Host response to Influenza).22 This lncNRA was significantly upregulated after PR8 infection in all CC mice except CAST/EiJ, NZO/HILt and PWK/PhJ, which were the three strains the most resistant to PR8 infection. The expression of n268833 was highly correlated with PR8 replication, belonged to the turquoise module, and was strongly positively correlated with IL-18. Among the list of DE lncRNAs present in QTL controlling SARS-CoV resistance, n276032 (AK047596), n290720 (AK017435) and n292484 (AK132900) were specifically upregulated in CAST/EiJ mice infected by MA15, which had the highest viral replication and the most weight loss. n276032 is in the QTL associated with SARS-CoV titer [Gralinski et al., in preparation], was annotated in the turquoise module and was enriched in innate immune pathways by the rank-based method. These results suggest that some lncRNAs might control mouse genetic susceptibility to respiratory viruses, and highlight the richness of this data set to mine from different angles to further hypothesis generation and an understanding of respiratory virus pathogenesis and lncRNA functions.",

We provide the scientific community with a database (MONOCLdb) to easily retrieve expression values and annotation of any given lncRNA. In addition, we generated a large RNA-Seq data set, with gene-expression profiles from 120 CC founder mice. This represents a valuable resource for mouse genomic studies and for the Collaborative Cross. We expect that this work will help to design the experimental characterization of important lncRNAs and will accelerate general knowledge about lncRNA functions. In particular, mechanistic characterization of lncRNAs predicted to belong to the IFN response would have a broad impact for immunology and infectious disease fields.",

A complete signed weighted co-expression network was built following the WGCNA method.42 Briefly, the adjacency matrix was computed using [(1 + A)/2]\u03b2 where A is the adjacency matrix of biweight midcorrelations and the soft-thresholding power \u03b2 was fixed to 12 based on the scale free topology criterion as previously described.42 Bottlenecks of the weighted network were determined by estimating the number of shortest paths going through each node (betweenness centrality, bc) with a maximum path length of 20 using igraph R package.43 Central genes of the networks that are heavily connected nodes, or hubs, were determined by calculating weighted degree for each gene considering the whole network (kTotal) or only genes belonging to the same module (kWithin).",

In addition, genes highly expressed in immune cells compared with lung were defined as genes expressed 20-fold more in each immune cell subset than in lung based on microarray analysis from GeneAtlas V3 (GSE10246) and that were expressed only in that cell subset. IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were defined as the union of genes significantly upregulated 12 and 24 h after treatment of BALB/c mice with IFN-\u03b1 46 and genes significantly upregulated in at least one of the eight CC founder-strain-derived MEF cells treated with IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2 (Log2FC > 2 and adjusted Student\u2019s p-value < 0.01).

Enrichment in each gene-set was computed using the Wilcoxon rank\u2013sum (WRS) test implemented in the Piano Bioconductor Package.51 Significance was estimated from the normal distribution and p-values were adjusted with the Bonferroni method. We used the up distinct-directional p-value, which assesses whether genes belonging to a given gene-set are significantly enriched in the top of the ranked list (i.e., highly positively correlated with the lncRNA). We chose to consider only positively correlated genes (and not both highly positively and negatively correlated genes) because we found that positive signed correlation outperformed unsigned correlation to associate genes with similar functions (Fig S6). Adjusted p-value < 0.05 were considered as significant. For each gene-set, we further determined which lncRNA were the most associated with the gene-set by computing the percentile ranked (PR) on significant p-values.",

Significance of biweight midcorrelation was defined as two sided Student p-value < 0.01. lncRNAs with no significantly correlated neighboring gene or with both positively and negatively correlated neighbors were classified as potential trans lncRNAs. Specificity of potential cis lncRNA effect on coding neighbors was computed using PAGE analysis51 for cis lncRNA with more than two coding neighbors.
