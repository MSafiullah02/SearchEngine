Although most patients with IPF experience a steady decline in lung function over time, some will decline quickly, while others seem stable for many years. Increasingly, we recognize that some patients may also have a more unpredictable course [ 2 ] . These patients experience periods of relative stability followed by acute episodes of worsening in their respiratory status [ 3 ] . Episodes of acute respiratory decline in IPF can be secondary to complications such as infection, pulmonary [ 3 , 4 ] . Such episodes of acute respiratory deterioration have been termed AEx of IPF when the cause for the acute worsening cannot be identifi ed. Acute exacerbations likely comprise almost 50 % of these acute respiratory events, and the clinical characteristics and prognosis are indistinguishable from acute exacerbations of known cause. This chapter will discuss only AEx of IPF.",

It seems likely that patients with more severe IPF are more likely to develop clinically signifi cant AEx of disease, and this perception is supported by the increased incidence of AEx that was observed in the only study of advanced disease reported in the literature to date, namely, STEP-IPF [ 14 ] . Precipitating factors such as surgical lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) have also been reported [ 11 , 15 -20 ] .

Other defi nitions that have been described are generally similar; however, they often include a reduction in PaO 2 as one of their criteria as well as bilateral chest x-ray abnormalities (instead of a HRCT scan) [ 6 , 50 ] . The IPFNet criteria have helped to standardize the defi nition of AEx of IPF, but satisfaction of all criteria is quite diffi cult to achieve in many clinical settings. Specifi cally, it is not infrequent that in patients who appear to have AEx of IPF, microbiologic data and occasionally radiologic data are not collected due to the severity of illness or because the clinician does not feel the tests will change clinical management. By maximizing specifi city at the cost of sensitivity, these criteria (along with the selection of only mild to moderate patients for enrollment) have likely contributed to the low prevalence of AEx observed in recent clinical trials [ 51 -53 ] . The choice of defi nition has signifi cant implications for outcome analyses in clinical trials and should be a focus for further discussion among clinical trialists.",

Recent international guidelines on IPF management suggested that the majority of IPF patients with AEx could be treated with corticosteroids [ 58 ] ; however, approaches to dosing, route, and duration of therapy were not provided. Although most clinicians would treat patients who develop an AEx of IPF with high-dose corticosteroids, the effi cacy of this treatment is unclear. Perhaps we should be more critical of the use of corticosteroids to treat AEx of IPF. There are two distinct viewpoints regarding the role of corticosteroids in AEx of IPF. The fi rst viewpoint is that AEx of IPF is histopathologically similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) characterized by DAD and acute lung injury [ 59 ] and should, therefore, be treated similarly to ARDS. In the ARDS literature, the mortality benefi t of corticosteroids is unclear [ 60 -65 ] . In one study, increased mortality was observed in ARDS patients treated with delayed corticosteroids (after 14 days) [ 65 ] . If we were to follow the ARDS paradigm, most clinicians would not use corticosteroids in the treatment of AEx of IPF. A second viewpoint for the role of corticosteroids in IPF is that some patients with AEx of IPF have organizing pneumonia on biopsy [ 49 ] . Organizing pneumonia is generally thought to be steroid responsive, and it may be that the pathobiology is different enough between ARDS and AEx of IPF to warrant continued use of corticosteroids. There remains equipoise on the effi cacy of corticosteroids in AEx of IPF, and this treatment intervention should be studied more carefully [ 42 ] .",

In this retrospective case series of 11 patients, 6 patients failed a NIPPV trial and went subsequently succumbed to respiratory failure. The other fi ve patients survived more than 3 months after the onset of their AEx.

As many patients with AEx of IPF will not meet the current consensus criteria due to missing data, it may be more useful clinically to defi ne AEx by less stringent criteria. It seems likely that the prevention and treatment of AEx of IPF must focus on both disease-specifi c (e.g., anti-fi brotic therapies) and non-disease-specifi c (e.g., vaccination, prevention of stress) areas. The next decade will hopefully answer many of the unresolved questions concerning AEx of IPF.",
