            "text": "The ecology of Ebola virus (EBV) remains largely unknown, but the previous detection of viral RNA and anti-EBV antibodies in African bats suggests that they might play a role in the EBV reservoir. Moreover, African bats also carry other potentially zoonotic agents such as Henipah-like viruses, coronaviruses and lyssaviruses. Today only little information is available on interactions between humans and bats. The objective of our exploratory study was to describe the extent and modes of contacts between humans and bats in southern Cameroon, considered as an area at risk for future EBV outbreaks. The survey was conducted in 11 villages of four distinct rural areas in southern Cameroon. A total of 135 respondents were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires, between February and May 2017. The study showed that direct contacts between bats and humans are relatively common. Bat bushmeat appeared to be an occasional meat resource; 40% of respondents consume bats with a median annual consumption of three, and 28% of respondents hunt them. About 22% of the respondents reported children catching bats. Indirect contact also appeared to be common; 55% of hunters use caves as shelters and 67% of interviewees eat fruits previously chewed by bats. Bat consumption varied significantly between regions (from 0% to 87%) and between pygmies and bantus in the extreme southeast of Cameroon. The study revealed considerable diversity in practices among interviewees, most of them being subsistence cultivators and relying on self-hunted bushmeat. Geographical diversity of contacts and perceptions regarding bats in Cameroon emphasizes the need to adjust zoonotic pathogen surveillance and education campaigns to the specificities of the communities and their context of interaction with wildlife.",

Current evidence suggests that EBV reservoir is complex and might involve several species. Attention has been drawn to bats in which viral RNA was detected in a handful of wild living specimens only (Leroy et al., 2005) as well as anti-EBV antibodies in several species (Hayman et al., 2012 Leroy et al., 2005; Ogawa et al., 2015; , but knowledge about the maintenance of the virus in bat populations is scarce. The limited number of positive specimen detected so far (Leendertz, Gogarten, D\u00fcx, Calvignac-Spencer, & Leendertz, 2016; Leroy et al., 2005) , despite intensive sampling efforts, hampered by the richness of African fauna, limits our understanding of EBV ecology in wildlife.",

But for most outbreaks, the initial source of zoonotic transmission has not been identified. The only laboratory-confirmed sources of human Ebola disease are duikers, chimpanzees and gorillas and great ape populations in which viral RNA has been identified on animal carcasses (Le Guenno et al., 1995; Leroy et al., 2004) .

This is especially significant as a single zoonotic disease transmission can have major consequences as illustrated by the large EBV outbreaks in West Africa with subsequent transmission chains of human-to-human transmissions (Baize et al., 2014) . In regard to indirect contacts, communities are homogeneously exposed to fruits possibly contaminated by bat faeces or saliva, since 67% of respondents consume munched fruits. This raises concern, since there is evidence of transmission of other viruses carried by bats to humans through this route, for instance, Nipah virus spillovers caused fatal encephalitis and respiratory failure in South-East Asia (Breed, Field, Epstein, & Daszak, 2006; Chua et al., 2000) . African bats also host similar paramyxoviruses that could potentially be transmitted in the same way (Weiss et al., 2012) , though zoonotic transmission and impact of these viruses on human health are still unknown. risk. This is not surprising considering similar results of other studies (Gbogbo & Kyei, 2017; Kamins et al., 2015) , conducted in countries where awareness-raising campaigns had been implemented previously, contrary to Cameroon. More strikingly, even when respondents spontaneously mention Ebola disease, they declare not to feel \"at risk\" in their country, since no outbreak has occurred yet.

Three of these areas (Campo [CP], Northern periphery of Dja Reserve [BQ], Mambele [MB]) are close to protected natural parks, and have a relatively rich fauna. This is in contrast to the area of Gwap/Bipindi (BP), where bushmeat has become scarce in the last decade due to a combination of factors, including over-hunting, deforestation and agricultural intensification. The study sites had previously been chosen for their richness in gorilla and chimpanzee populations in the context of studies on the origin of HIV, conducted by the team since 2000 (Keele et al., 2006), in addition to studies investigating the EBV reservoir in wildlife initiated in 2015. These remote areas are hardly accessible and transportation to the closest city is limited for their inhabitants. Villages are organized along the main dirt road, usually built to transport wood from logging concessions (in all four areas) or products from mining concessions (with BOCOM company exploiting iron in the area of BP). Fruit trees are located around the houses; cultivated fields are nearby the villages bordering the forest.",
