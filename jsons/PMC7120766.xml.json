            "text": "Mismatched ABO solid organ transplantation is often employed due to the shortage of transplantable organs. Three different groups of ABO incompatibility\ncan be found in transplantation: minor, major, and bidirectional. Complications arising from minor ABO-mismatched solid organ transplants include the passenger lymphocyte syndrome (PLS) [6]. Recipients of minor ABO-incompatible transplantation express ABO antigens that are not expressed in the donor and may result in a graft-versus-host (GvH) reaction, including delayed hemolysis of recipient red blood cells [7]. Passenger lymphocyte syndrome\noccurs when antibodies that are produced by the donor B-lymphocytes result in a primary or secondary immune response against the recipient\u2019s ABO and Rh antigens. The severity of hemolysis\ndepends on the level of red cell isoagglutinins in the donor tissue that are passively transferred with the organ and the subsequent rise in antibodies in the transplant recipient that occurs 1\u20133 weeks posttransplant and usually resolves within 3 months posttransplant [7]. In rare instances, PLS can occur due to non-ABO/Rh antibodies if the organ had been previously sensitized to other red cell antigens in the setting of pregnancy or transfusion [8\u201311]. PLS occurs more frequently in the heart and lung transplants and less frequently in liver and kidney transplants [7].",

A number of immunosuppressants with various pharmacologic mechanisms of action are used to prolong graft and recipient survival. The immunosuppressants mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus have been shown to cause anemia in renal transplant recipients [12]. One-year posttransplant, renal transplant patients with anemia who are on mycophenolate mofetil have a lower rates of survival and higher rates of cardiovascular death [13]. Sirolimus, another immunosuppressant, may result in greater myelosuppression compared to mycophenolate mofetil [14]. Sirolimus and calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus and cyclosporine have been shown in renal and lung transplant recipients to cause hemolytic anemia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome [15\u201317]. The calcineurin inhibitors have been shown to cause anemia ranging from 1% to 5% in European trials to 38\u201347% in US trial [18]. The antimetabolite azathioprine, a purine-analog drug\n, can also cause cytopenias. Mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, azathioprine, and anti-thymocyte globulin have all shown to cause pure red cell aplasia [19, 20].",

This syndrome is a result of aberrant immune response of abnormal T-cell activation leading to hemophagocytosis by activated, nonmalignant macrophages that secrete numerous cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the bone marrow, liver, lymph nodes, and spleen, resulting in a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d [29]. Acquired hemophagocytic syndrome has been documented in the renal, liver, heart, and pancreas-kidney solid organ transplants.

While this etiology is more often identified as a drug-related phenomenon, particularly due to the immunosuppressants required to prevent organ rejection (see next section), there have been multiple case reports associating CMV infection as a trigger of TMA in the posttransplant setting [53, 54]. This has been noted with particular frequency in the renal transplant literature, where both de novo and recurrent forms of aHUS were associated with CMV infection in renal transplant recipients. However, particularly in the patients with \u201cde novo\u201d disease, it is possible that CMV may be directly driving the thrombotic microangiopathy, rather than solely by the complement-mediated events of aHUS. Mechanisms thought to be underlying CMV\u2019s endothelial effects include activation of CMV-specific cytotoxic immune responses and induction of primitive endothelial dysfunction as well as direct infection of endothelial cells by CMV [55, 56].",

The medication is frequently used in the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE)\n, which has been an infection seen in transplant patients, as well as non-transplant patients, with increasing frequency. A multicenter compassionate use trial published in 2003 showed that it was an effective drug in treating VRE, which was identified as having a mortality rate of up to 83%, with the authors reporting a 62% survival rate after treatment with linezolid. Thrombocytopenia was the main adverse effect of treatment, seen in 4.7%, but did not necessitate the cessation of therapy [68]. A second study in liver transplant patients treated with linezolid for VRE infection showed a similar treatment efficacy and again reported no cases (0/46 patients) requiring cessation of therapy due to severe thrombocytopenia, and furthermore found no correlation between treatment duration and platelet counts [69] though other articles advise caution when using linezolid for extended time periods [70]. Thus, while it may or may not require any intervention or change in treatment plan, it should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis when assessing thrombocytopenia.",

This acute decrease generally resolves within the 1st month after transplant, and if thrombocytopenia persists, another etiology should be sought [79, 83, 84]. Thrombocytopenia following liver transplant can also be attributed to residual portal hypertension or hypersplenism, if either of these conditions persist following transplant. However, it is important to remain vigilant to other causes particularly drug-related and infectious etiologies that could cause a drop in the platelet count.",
