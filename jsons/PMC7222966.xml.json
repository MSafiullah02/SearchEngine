The mortality of MG has declined due to discovery of choline esterase inhibitors, immunomodulators, thymectomy, and advancement in treatment of infections and intensive care units (ICU). As the patients with MG are living longer, a number of comorbidities have been noted. The patients with MG may be associated with autoimmune as well as non-autoimmune comorbidities along with treatment related complications which may affect the outcome. In the developing countries, there is higher frequency of infection, malnutrition, and many non-communicable diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease and stroke, which are more severe and occur in younger patients. Moreover poor health infrastructure in these countries further aggravates the situation. Use of statins, and many antibiotics and antihypertensives may affect neuromuscular transmission leading to aggravation of myasthenic weakness. There is paucity of studies on the role of comorbidities in the outcome of MG, and most of the studies have evaluated the role of immunological comorbidity [2\u20137]. None of these studies comprehensively evaluated the role of different type of comorbidities in the outcome of MG [1, 8\u201311]. In the present study, we report the burden of comorbidities and their role in the outcome of the patients with MG.",

The comorbidities were autoimmune disorders in 10% and miscellaneous in 88% patients. Amongst the miscellaneous comorbidities, diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease were more common in late onset MG. Patients with comorbidities were also associated with myasthenic crisis and poor outcome. This study evaluated association of comorbidities and its influence in the outcome of MG. The patients with MG are at greater risk of autoimmune comorbidities compared to non-myasthenic population with a frequency of 25\u201378%, especially in females and those with early onset MG [18, 19]. In other studies, the frequency of second autoimmune disorder in MG patients ranged from 13 to 14% [6, 7]. Amongst the autoimmune disorders, autoimmune thyroiditis is the commonest followed by rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus [18, 20]. The autoimmune comorbidities vary in different subgroups of MG. The patients with early onset MG have much higher frequency of autoimmune comorbidities compared to late onset. Although the latter subgroup also has higher frequency of comorbidities compared to general population. Autoimmune thyroid disorder is the most common autoimmune comorbidity with MG and in up to 10% in early onset MG [6]. In our study, there was only one patient with autoimmune thyroiditis in early onset group and one patient with rheumatoid arthritis, which is reported in other studies as well [6, 19]. In a study on 75 patients with MG, autoimmune comorbidities were present in 21 (28%) and included autoimmune thyroid disorders in 16%, rheumatoid arthritis in 4%, systemic lupus erythematosus in 2.6% and Lambert\u2013Eaton myasthenic syndrome in 1.3%. In ten patients, the diagnosis of autoimmune disorder was established before MG [3]. In our study, autoantibodies were present in 17 (21%) patients; rheumatoid factor in 1, antinuclear antibody in 12, anti-ds-DNA in 6 and anti-TPO antibody in 4. Autoantibodies can be found in MG without clinical evidence of respective autoimmune disorder and may be marker of a later autoimmune disorder in some patients. We, however, did not do a long term follow up to document the significance of these autoantibodies. Ocular myasthenia has a special link with thyroid disorders [21, 22]. In our study, eight out of nine patients with ocular MG had comorbidities. Myasthenia associated with autoimmune thyroid disease has a milder clinical course [2].",

The reported frequency of myasthenic crisis is 15\u201320% who require mechanical ventilator [24].
