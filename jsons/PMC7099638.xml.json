The recent Coronavirus epidemic outbreak, reported for the first time in late 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, is rapidly becoming of worldwide concern. Coronaviruses are single, plus-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae including MERS (MERS-CoV) and SARS (SARS-CoV). Coronavirus cause different disease with respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neurological clinical symptoms [1,2]. In December 2019, several clusters of patients with pneumonia of unknown origin, epidemiologically associated with a seafood and animal market in Wuhan, were described, calling the attention of the Chinese Center for Disease Control (Report of clustering pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan City (Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, 2019; http://wjw .wuhan .gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2019123108989), leading to the isolation of a new coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, distinct from both MERS-CoV and SARS [3].",

A maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny was reconstructed using IQ-TREE 1.6.8 software under the HKY nucleotide substitution model with four gamma categories (HKY+G4), which was inferred in jModelTest (https://github.com/ddarriba/jmodeltest2) as the best fitting model [9].",

The ML phylogeny was used as a starting tree for Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis using BEAST 1.10.4 (http://beast.community/index.html) [11]. We employed a stringent model selection analysis using both path-sampling (PS) and stepping stone (SS) procedures to estimate the most appropriate molecular clock model for the Bayesian phylogenetic analysis [12]. We tested a) the strict molecular clock model, which assumes a single rate across all phylogeny branches, and b) the more flexible uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock model with a lognormal rate distribution (UCLN) [13]. Both SS and PS estimators indicated the uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock (Bayes Factor = 4.3) as the best fitted model to the dataset under analysis. Besides, we have used the he HKY+G4 codon partitioned (CP)1 + 2,3 substitution model and the Bayesian Skyline coalescent model of population size and growth [14]. We computed MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) duplicate runs of 100 million states each, sampling every 10,000 steps. Convergence of MCMC chains was checked using Tracer v.1.7.1 [14]. Proper mixing of the MCMC was checked for ESS values >200 for each estimated parameter using Tracer 1.7. Systematic Biology. 2018;67(5):901\u20134). A Maximum Clade Credibility (MCC) trees was obtained from the tree posterior distribution using TreeAnnotator (http://beast.community/index.html) after 10% burn-in.",

The root-to-tip vs. divergence plot of the full dataset showed high correlation between sampling time and genetic distance to the root of the ML tree of the available sequences (R-squared 0.85), indicating substantial temporal signal and the possibility to calibrate a reliable molecular clock, despite the limited number of sequences and short sampling interval available.",

The first evidence of 2019-nCoV dissemination appears to be, according to our phylogeographic reconstruction, from Wuhan, China, to Nonthamburi, Thailand, with an spp. of 0.96, followed by the emergence of two distinct lineages, one with further spreading in Nonthamburi, and the second one following a more complex pattern: from Nonthamburi to Zhejiang, Huangzhou (spp = 0.47), as well as from Zhejiang to Kanagawa, Kanto (spp = 0.62) and from Nonthamburi to Guandong, Zhuhai (spp = 0.45). The first reported US cases, in Chicago, Illinois and Seattle, Washington, appeared to be linked to Guandong, Zhuhai isolates, in agreement with reports of patients traveling back from that region of China before being diagnosed. Finally, our analysis identified the Bat SARS-like Coronavirus as the most probable origin of the 2019-nCoV (spp = 0.99).",

The substantial degree of genetic heterogeneity (15%) accumulated among human isolates during the past few months of the ongoing epidemic outbreak is not necessarily surprising for an RNA virus that has been shown to be a measurably evolving population over short time spans [15]. However, our findings underscore the urgent need for further molecular surveillance and the development of appropriate and an in-depth monitoring system capable of investigating viral mutation and transmission capabilities as 2019-nCoV unfortunately keeps spreading at a regional and potential global level. In other words, given the virus\u2019s fast evolutionary rate and population dynamic, tracking the emergence of novel transmission routes and/or patterns should be considered a significant priority.",

(https://www.biorxiv.org/) suggesting that a Bat SARS-like coronavirus sequence is homologous and genetically more similar to the 2019-nCoV than other Bat SARS-like coronavirus sequences, but very distant from sequences isolated in SARS 202/2003 epidemic and MERS coronavirus. The finding may imply a most recent common ancestor between 2019-nCoV and the Bat SARS-like Coronavirus circulating in the Rhinolophus bat family. We also identify, in agreement with epidemiological reports, the city of Wuhan as the most likely origin of the human epidemic, dating back to the end of November 2019. In 2010, a previous article has suggested that the emergence of diverse virus strains within a few decades, in the different Rhinolophus species, may be the result of rapid evolution generating variants with the ability of easily crossing species barriers. The same study has shown that the epizootic transmission of the SARS from bat to human during the 2003 epidemic may have actually occurred up to 8 years earlier than the actual human outbreak [16]. Moreover, the migration map of the Rhinolophus bats in China involves almost the same geographic areas of the 2019-nCoV epidemic (http://www.bio.bris.ac.uk/research/bats/China%20bats/rhinolophussinicus.htm). Taken together, these results indicate a recurring pattern among the sub-genre of the Betacoronavirus leading to periodical epizootic epidemics.",

However, molecular epidemiological data analyses, when sampling strategies are appropriate and representative of the full genetic heterogeneity of the pathogen population, can circumvent human error and present quantitative information about an infectious agent.",
