            "text": "All major human viral diseases once originated in other animal species and formed unconnected prehistoric biological islands, but now, new pathogens are being characterized at an unprecedented level with the potential for dramatic pandemics, due both to ecological perturbations and to technological improvements in detection [1]. Nevertheless, at a recent international biomedical conference, one speaker reminded the audience of the statistical \u2018irrelevance\u2019 of emerging infectious diseases, by categorical comparisons to major causes of human death today. Put simply, even populations in the developing world are approaching levels of cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer and other chronic maladies, that were previously only found in developed countries. Although this may certainly be true, if an individual evades acute viral diarrhoea, pneumonia, haemorrhagic fever, hepatitis, encephalitis, etc. and survives out of infanthood to adolescence, those more modern facets of chronic illness are largely associated with a personal lifestyle elevated gradually to a community level. In contrast, zoonoses per se, are largely not a matter of conscious public choice, although the exposures that lead to a productive infection are often provoked directly by the individual. Irrespective of surreptitious media bragging rights to causality behind any fictitious \u2018zombie apocalypse\u2019 or its preparedness (http://www.cdc.gov/phpr/zombies.htm; http://www.cracked.com/article_15643_5-scientific-reasons-zombie-apocalypse-could-actually-happen.html) in the growing collective consciousness (for which a discerning scientific audience would have to ascribe not to bacteria, fungi or protozoa, but to a viral aetiology objectively), the image of a post-SARS world is only too real in the not-too-distant memory, given the actual extremes of current global headlines of translocated viral infections from one continent to another. Moreover, regardless of the magnitude of long-term lifestyle choices behind major human mortality trends, most health professionals should agree that the probability would be highly unlikely that a traveller today would be screened, detained and possibly quarantined against their will at an international port of entry, because of being a smoker, alcohol-user or obese, as opposed to a suggestion of an infection with a viral infectious aetiology, with obvious immediate consequences for the perceived greater public good. Hence, many would argue that viral zoonoses are indeed still relevant, based upon the evidence at hand.",

            "text": "Why are viral zoonoses relevant, but neglected? Considering the ultimate origins of historical pathogens as diverse as the eradicated smallpox and the much debated 1918 pandemic influenza, viruses are a highly relevant focus group when considering the general concept of zoonoses as a whole, from obvious biodiversity, to the sheer magnitude of their resultant cumulative morbidity and mortality in the animal kingdom writ large and the concomitant host\u2013pathogen arms race [2]. Such viruses are the quintessential obligate microbiological parasites, whose diversity across all life on earth is unmatched. Rates of evolution, particularly among RNA viruses, excel at real-time orders of magnitude [3]. Antibiotics are useless, antiviral drugs remain limited and proper discovery requires a requisite twenty-first century laboratory sophistication, relatively far from the ecosystems where these zoonoses perpetuate, from urban mega-slums to increasingly fragmented Old World rain forests, supporting both viral specialists and generalists within multi-host assemblages [4]. Within the \u2018mind's eye\u2019, unlike multicellular organisms and bacterial/fungal colonies, viral existence and growth are typically unseen and often asymptomatic. \u2018Out of sight, out of mind\u2019, in the sense of the virome, is taken to an extreme from the perspective of neglect with most viruses in the primary host, unless frank disease and mortality are manifest. To the evolutionary biologist, all extant human viruses rose from more humble origins. Bereft from an appreciation of animal ecology, viruses, by definition, are neglected, in a circumspect fashion, and undergo a pattern of subtle repetition over time (Fig. 1\n). What began as a largely one-sided accident before animal domestication millennia ago proceeds to a \u2018reverse-zoonosis\u2019 paradigm, as expanding inter-connected human communities become the drivers back to other animals, often with disastrous consequences for threatened and endangered species [5].",

Of the hundreds of potential viral candidates, what constitutes a \u2018neglected viral zoonosis\u2019 (NVZ)? To be considered a NVZ, a disease is not equivalent to being merely odd or rare, objectively, from the stand point of concentration, which does not diminish the public health concern for any malady, per se. Hence, as one example, obviously simian herpesvirus is a serious viral infection, but not a NVZ. Similarly, a NVZ does not necessarily mean that no diagnostics or vaccines or practical mitigation options exist or that little is known about pathogen epizootiology. In fact, ironically, many NVZ have pragmatic solutions for investigation, prevention and control\u2014exacerbating the overall philosophy of neglect. Rather, operationally defined subjectively, NVZ should be associated with significant \u2018negative\u2019 attributes, including: substantive human morbidity and mortality; broad distribution; serious economic costs; selective opportunity to spread if ignored; a lack of concentrated long-term efforts focused at the source; and a disproportionate burden on the poor [6], [7]. So defined, most NVZ occur in developing countries with a subtropical to tropical occurrence.",

            "text": "To a finite extent, biomedical introspection related to entry, reception, replication, transcription, assembly and exit from one species to a human may provide a great deal of inference to various NVZ. However, beyond the descriptive \u2018who, what, where, when and how\u2019 of the original animal virion and the secondary human host, these qualitative insights will always be wanting to a greater epidemiological understanding of the \u2018why things are\u2019. Ultimately, besides an anatomical and physiological basis for a viral infection to transmit interspecifically, both pathogens and their reservoirs/vectors must exploit a complex anthropological, cultural, historical, political, psychological and social landscape that uniquely defines Homo sapiens, unlike any other animal population [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. Some of these facets include the ecological benefits (and limitations) of living in groups as a social species, hunting and gathering behaviours and dietary preferences, myths and religious doctrines, health economics and many others, in a myriad of a homo-sociome memetic complex (HOSMEC). Taken together, such an introspective transdisciplinary approach serves to explain the ultimate success or failure of a zoonosis programme and the basis of clues as to why some NVZ collapse or persist. Moreover, in-depth critical utilization of the HOSMEC idea may provide answers as to why a NVZ may reach a certain critical tipping point to finally receive focused attention among a myriad of outcomes, because of humanitarian extension of a novel intervention from applied research or due in part from a perceived threat to impact non-enzootic developed countries (Table 1\n). The reality of NVZ in situ is not as simple as a random meeting between infectious non-human host X and susceptible human individual Y, but predicated among populations by HOSMEC Z + N factors in space and time, as defined broadly by the human\u2013animal bond (Fig. 1).",

            "text": "A number of pervasive myths served to illustrate the HOSMEC spectrum as to why rabies languished as a NVZ (Table 2\n), despite being one of the oldest zoonoses and having the highest case fatality of any infectious disease. Simply put, a strong deliberate track record of primary evidence coalesced as counter HOSMEC facets to refute such arguments for programmatic obsolescence [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. Unfathomably, some may question the status of canine rabies as a NVZ, but the disease is a bona fide choice, considering that tens of thousands of people, mostly children, succumb annually, tens of millions of human exposures occur requiring intervention and all of the major tools for elimination were present by the mid-twentieth century [13], [14], [17]. By comparison with rinderpest, vaccination towards herd immunity, sensitive and specific diagnostics and the epidemiological knowledge to apply both to the field were comparable to an equally complex disease for decades [15], [18]. Oddly, canine rabies still exists in a diagnostic cycle of neglect, despite laboratory insights for confirmation since the late 1800s, and is the only infectious disease in which a routine diagnostic test applied to an animal directly determines the need for medical intervention in the bitten person [17]. Clearly, unlike beef, poultry, seafood and swine, dogs are not a conventional market commodity, even if they are still consumed in certain markets. As a result, rabies requires an inter-sectoral approach among professionals for ultimate success [13], [20], [23]. Inarguably, modern human and veterinary biological agents against rabies are pure, potent, safe, efficacious and inexpensive, considering the alternative outcome of a productive encephalitic infection [16], [17], [20]. Long-term lethal culling of dogs has not been demonstrated to be an ethically supported, ecologically based or economically sound strategy to control canine rabies [19], [20]. By contrast, in both the New and Old Worlds, herd immunity is achievable among dynamic canine populations [13], [15], [20]. Although a plethora of wildlife reservoirs maintain a diversity of other rabies virus variants, their existence in developed countries was not a barrier to canine rabies elimination and oral vaccination has proven to be a successful intervention towards a holistic programme approach, when mesocarnivore populations are determined to be important [21]. Although often used as an epidemiological ploy to explain programme failure or to save face, no true rabies virus carriers have been documented [22]. Substantively, rather than indefinite reliance upon outside economic aid, community engagement and social responsibility are a longer-term strategy for programme perpetuation [23]. Another HOSMEC facet to counter naysayers is a designated date for global action (http://rabiesalliance.org/world-rabies-day/) and the international partnering that has evolved among dedicated academic, government, industrial and non-governmental organization stakeholders, who champion the advocacy, communication, education and research towards canine rabies elimination as a realistic cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre\n[24].",

That is, are there particular major animal hosts that are contenders for discussion? Within the vertebrates, there are no serious NVZ candidates among the fish, amphibians and reptiles. Arguably, with the exception of the \u2018avian influenza mixing milieu\u2019 (which is not truly neglected by our above subjective criteria and the considerable budgets available for basic and applied research), no major NVZ are based among the birds. Concentrating upon mammals, with degrees of genetic relationship closest to Homo sapiens, one might be tempted to consider viral pathogens associated with non-human primates. However, unless considering the evolutionary and epidemiological relationships of the simian retroviruses (notwithstanding the consequent radiations that led to human immunodeficiency virus) and their related viral spectrum (which also do not fit the criteria of NVZ), the non-human primates are twenty-first century evolutionary bottlenecks, geographically isolated and largely not in temporal/spatial proximity to most people. This limitation does not apply to other relevant and highly misunderstood mammals\u2014the Chiroptera.",

Bats are not simply \u2018winged rodents\u2019, so one rationale to consider the bat-associated viral diseases as a single complex pertains to the biological attributes applied objectively to these species as a whole, in a special status [25]. Compared with human and domestic animal populations, wildlife have always been notoriously more difficult to study. Bats are no exception. As typically smaller, inconspicuous, volant animals, relatively less is known about this group than other mammalian taxa. As the second largest mammalian Order, with over 1000 species, their abundance, distribution, biodiversity and lifestyle collectively provide a complication when trying to infer overarching elements from epidemiological insights to prevention and control strategies over their collective virome, as exemplified by numerous NVZ [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]. Besides prominent scientific neglect until the mid-twentieth century, bats have been reviled in many cultures as concerns the HOSMEC principle, despite their obvious utility as the only prominent nocturnal predators of agricultural insect pests and by the ecological services they provide through pollination and reforestation from seed dispersal, which is often forgotten when weighing zoonotic risks in a conservation biology perspective [32].",

Major genera appear somewhat restrictive based upon surveillance to date, including: Artibeus, Desmodus, Eidolon, Eptesicus, Hipposideros, Lasiurus, Lasionycteris, Myotis, Perimyotis, Pteropus, Rousettus and Tadarida. Interspecific transmission may be direct, especially in the case of the bat lyssaviruses (such as vampire-transmitted rabies), but often may involve an intermediate mammalian host for amplification: insectivorous bats and civets in the night markets of Asia for SARS; Old World bats and non-human primates and bushmeat exposures for Marburg/Ebola viruses; fruit bats and horses for Hendra virus; pteropid bats and swine for Nipah and Menagle viruses; various bat species and camels for Middle East respiratory syndrome [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]. Besides long-term occupational alternatives for bushmeat acquisition, practices to limit the inappropriate harvesting and mixing of wild mammals for human consumption, curbs on habitat encroachment and degradation, among others, an intermediary link of domestic animals with the bat-associated NVZ offers a benchmark for development and application of relevant veterinary vaccines, as appropriate. Given these comparative points, and the recent flurry of attention over Ebola, a decade from now may be an appropriate time span to review the status of the filoviruses as a whole and their gradual rise to NVZ status and beyond, either towards ascendency approaching avian influenza in prominence or fading to obscurity with the other bat zoonoses.",

Within Africa, CHIKV circulates in an enzootic cycle involving forest-dwelling mosquitoes and non-human primates. The agent was first isolated in Tanzania during 1953 from the blood of a febrile person during a large outbreak of a disease characterized by severe fever and crippling joint pains (giving CHIKV its name, literally \u2018bent over\u2019). Out of Africa, CHIKV was isolated during 1958 from a patient in Bangkok. Sporadic outbreaks were reported in numerous African and Asian countries for decades and then during April 2005, CHIKV was confirmed as the cause of an epidemic of dengue-like illness on the Comoros islands off the east coast of northern Mozambique. Shortly after this outbreak, the disease was reported on Mayotte, Mauritius and the French island of La R\u00e9union [37]. During December 2003, CHIKV was detected in the French West Indies. The virus has spread rapidly to many other Caribbean islands, as well as to South America, and poses a significant threat to both North America and Europe [36].",

In contrast to the other two arboviral NVZ, the DENVs have a long history of human infection, with documented cases of a disease resembling dengue (meaning cramps, seizures, or stiff-gait) as early as the third century. In the late 1700s there appears to have been a widespread geographical distribution of dengue that coincided with the increasing global commerce aided by sailing ships. A second series of dengue-like pandemics were subsequently reported from Africa to India to Oceania and the Americas from 1823 to 1916. Following the Second World War and the dramatic increase in urbanization, with inadequate housing and water distribution systems, the vector Aedes aegypti reached high densities, facilitating the efficient transmission of DENV. Four antigenically distinct serotypes of DENV are recognized at present. In all four cases the transmission of DENV includes a sylvatic, enzootic cycle between non-human primates and arboreal mosquitoes of the genus Aedes. This has led to distinct emergence events presumably involving host shifts from arboreal Aedes mosquitoes to Aedes albopictus and later to Aedes aegypti\n[41].",

Clearly, from the rapid and ongoing increase in prevalence of these highlighted neglected taxa, control measures presently being used are ineffective. However, in some resource-poor environments, it may be possible to at least monitor the presence and relative abundance of insect vectors as a start, if technical staff with the requisite knowledge, skills and abilities are nurtured appropriately. Nevertheless, implementation of effective control programmes appears to be beyond the scope of the present resources. Some future innovative control programmes may have the potential to make a difference in regions where only one mosquito is the sole vector, but similar approaches have yet to be successful with all potential vectors and NVZ pathogens.",

Significantly, during the 1960s, a campaign to eradicate Aedes aegypti from South America had a dramatic influence on the transmission of DENV. When this campaign was abandoned, there was a massive increase in vector abundance that contributed significantly to the high rates of DENV infection today [51]. Even greater challenges are posed with Aedes albopictus\n[52], [53]. An integrated One Health programme should engage community participation in vector control, including elimination of larvae by reducing potential breeding containers and treatment with larvicides, insecticidal spraying, especially targeted spraying in potential resting areas (fogging with large amounts of insecticide has minimal effect when it fails to reach the target insects) and biological control using larvivorous organisms or bioinsecticides. There is potential opportunity in environmental release of genetically modified insects, including those infected with Wolbachia species. However, this has yet to be developed for Aedes albopictus\n[52], [53]. Additionally, the implementation of autocidal gravid ovitraps may substantially reduce the populations of vectors [54]. Post-application, vector monitoring is an extremely useful tool and is absolutely essential to direct effective control programmes and to gauge success.",

Rabies, the bat-associated viral zoonoses and the arthropod-borne viruses transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes provide a contrasting panoramic cross-section of the opportunities and challenges posed by such concomitant NVZ in economically disadvantaged tropical regions. By historical illustration, as one of the oldest appreciated infectious diseases, canine-transmitted rabies is the epitome of a NVZ, with a strong probability for continued success in substantial prevention, control and elimination over the next 10\u201320 years. In contrast, although the bat-associated zoonotic viruses have received increasing attention over the last decade and appear to be emergent for similar reasons regardless of viral pathogen, there are no major options for vaccine intervention at the wildlife source, in comparison with canine rabies. Considering arboviruses, the DENV, CHIKV and Zika viruses represent a similar clinical syndrome in toto and may obfuscate surveillance and appropriate medical response, yet more simplified monitoring systems and mitigation focused upon the primary mosquito vectors should be advantageous, in lieu of available human vaccination.",

Finally, beyond the classical microbiological and biomedical aspects of human, veterinary and conservation medicine, the basic underpinnings to these neglected entities are often more deeply rooted in a complex suite of anthropological, cultural, religious and social factors, which also may persist or change abruptly over time as the agents and vectors in kind. Failing to appreciate such a transdisciplinary HOSMEC milieu may do little to alter the history associated in the complex causality at the root of zoonotic disease emergence and perpetuation, within the evolutionary play on an increasingly small global ecological stage.",
