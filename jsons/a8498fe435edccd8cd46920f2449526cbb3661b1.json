Then, it rises serious and critical questions to whether general measures can be taken worldwide. Also, it is unclear if conventional parametric methods are suitable to study pandemics since their dynamic is modulated by biological, economical, environmental, social, and cultural factors. In this manuscript, we apply a recently developed non-parametric mathematical method that comes from regional economy, to investigate the dynamic of a pandemic. We apply this novel methodology to study the ongoing covid19 pandemic in all USA states and in the country itself. The generality of our methodology makes it suitable to investigate also the worldwide dynamics of diseases such HIV or tuberculosis. : medRxiv preprint",

Since neither effective antiviral drugs or vaccine exist in a new outbreak, preventive measures are needed to stop the spreading of virus. Therefore, control measures (e.g. social distancing) should be properly undertaken in order to modulate the trajectory of the epidemic and minimize the impact on the health care system [2] . However, it is not clear wether similar measures should be taken by regions with a different health care capacity response, population size, and the number of new positive along with fatal cases daily. It is also unclear which measures are more effective than others in different regions. These concerns are even more critical and urgent since new outbreaks are predicted in a not-to-far future [3] .",

First, for the case of coronavirus, two strains are identified: the S-and L-type, being the later the most aggressive and infectious. The L-type was more prevalent in early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan than the S-type, and the relative prevalence of these strains have changed during the pandemic [4]. We remark that it is unclear if the relative frequency between the S-and L-strain follows a similar pattern in different regions affected by the virus. Second, environmental factors such as humidity, temperature, and airflow are relevant to determine the transmission and the stability of human respiratory viruses such as the SARS-Cov2 [5], [6] . Therefore, the diversity of environmental conditions will also determine the dynamic of the pandemic in different regions affected by the virus. Third, risk factors such as older age or cardiac injury were associated with higher in-hospital mortality [10], [11] . This result indicates that the dynamic of the covid19 pandemic will be different in regions whose the elderly represents a higher percentage of the population. Fourth, the coronavirus spreads mainly through close interaction with infected people, by coming into contact with droplets, exhaled or coughed, that contain the coronavirus [18]. Thus, public measures are designed to reduce people's mobility and so the spreading of the disease [2]. However, we remark that the severeness of these measures are associated to the impact on the economy and are culturally and socially influenced whereas its effectiveness depends on human behavior.

The location quotient (LQ) was introduced by Robert Murray Haig in 1920 [13] and have a wide application in economy, [14] , [16] , [15] and [17] . However, LQ was seriously criticized. In regional economy, the LQ needs two dimensions for its definition, the economical dimension (productive sector of the economy) and the spacial dimension (the regions of the economy). Recently, in a PhD thesis 1 at the Catholic University of Brasilia, the LQ was modified by considering an extra dimension, the time. With this modification, now the applicability of this non-parametric framework can be extended to problems dealing with a temporal dynamic, which is the case of the ongoing covid19 pandemic.",

Each period p can be seen as a moving window of size P spanning the complete horizon H. In term of lineal Algebra, we fix a region r \u2208 {1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , R} and a period p \u2208 {1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , H \u2212 P + 1} to define a matrix with S rows and P columns, called the Regional Matrix of location quotients, denoted by RM LQ p r . Here, each matrix has associated a semi definite symmetric matrix (the covariance matrix), denoted here as CV p r . Since CV p r is symmetric and semi definite, it has real eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The interpretation of each eigenvalue \u03bb is as follows: if m is the mean of the rows of the matrix RM LQ p r and \u00a3 is the line that passes through m with direction of the eigenvector v associated to \u03bb, then \u03bb represent the dispersion of the projections of the rows of matrix RM LQ p r over \u00a3. So, all the eigenvalues represent the dispersion of the rows respect to m. Since the focus is the concentration of all the productive sectors in the region r at the period p, then the norm of the vector contains all the eigenvalues of the matrix CV p r is defined as the concentration index of all productive sectors in the region r at the period p.",

After collecting these data, we applied our model using a code written in Scilab and built the matrices GP and AXS for USA. We mentioned earlier that the coronavirus mainly spreads through close interaction with infected people [18] . As a result, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and all states of USA have taken several measures (between march 15 -16 +/\u2212 5 days, Figure 1 ) such legally enforcing social distancing, declaring state of emergency, or closing all non-essential businesses to limit people's contact [18], namely reduce people's mobility. Note that some measures are more flexible than others and they also differ between USA states, making it hard to correlate them with GP and AXS. Therefore, we also collected people's mobility daily data of all USA states to correlate them with the the corresponding GP and AXS dynamics ( Figure 1 ). We believe that the reduction of people's mobility is the result of all types of diverse measures taken by a particular USA state or the country to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. In other words, restriction of people's mobility aims to the convergence GP (2, t) and GP (3, t) to zero. Daily historical people's mobility data per USA state was collected from the \"wallethub\" database (https://wallethub.com/edu/). Figure 1A ). These observations indicate that the positive test (infected people) and deaths were close to be contained ({GP (2, t)}, Figure 1C ). Note that the reduction of {GP (3, t)} and {GP (2, t)} is accompanied by the decrease of people's mobility from around 10 to 0%, where public measures start taking place between march 15-16 ( Figure 1E ). Note that the aggregation of positive test ({AXS(2, t)}) and fatal cases ({AXS(3, t)}), increased monotonically during 29 day (from March 06) ( Figure 1D , 1F).",

After this process, we selected six USA states for the case of positive test: Alabama, California, Maine, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, and Washington ( Figure 2C ). For the case of deaths we selected: Maine, Michigan, New Jersey, and New York ( Figure 2D ). Some of USA states, have high CI values than the ones selected, either at the beginning, at the end or in a middle period, but GP (s, t) \u2212 LP (s, r, t) was fluctuating around zero, indicating that on average they follow the global trend.

To rationalize our findings with factors that may be critical for the increase of the concentration of infected people and deaths in each USA state.

For example, California achieved earlier (since March 11) and more dramatic reduction of people's mobility (down to -35%) whereas Michigan reduced people mobility around 4 days later and only down to -30% ( Figure  2B ). However, Michigan was more successful to contain the spreading of the virus.

Only for the case of New York, this high fatality rate can also be associated with the 13% less ICU bead per 1000 people than the average ( Figure 3C ). For the case of Michigan and Maine, the high mortality can be explained only by the higher percentage of adult population above 65 years than the average in USA, around 24 and 56% respectively ( Figure 3E-F) . Only for the case of Maine, the high mortality can also be associated with the 16% less ICU bead per 1000 people than the average ( Figure 3C ). Overall, we conclude that a USA state with high mortality can be associated to a higher percentage of adult population above 65 years relative to the average. Other factors such the lack of ICU beads and the poverty of this high risk population can also explain the high mortality relative to the global trend, but they are not Determinant. Nonetheless, these factors do not necessarily imply that a particular USA state will have a high fatality rate. For instance, Florida has 66 and 307% more than the average of the global percentage of adult population above 65 years and in poverty, respectively; and yet the mortality rate in this case follows the trend of the global percentage. On the other hand, a lower percentage of these high risk population does necessary implies a lower fatality rate ( Figure 3E) , which is the case for all USA states that were not selected for the analysis.",
