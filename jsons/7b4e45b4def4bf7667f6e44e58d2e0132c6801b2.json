This number was reduced by elimination of all nonrelevant articles. 19 articles were found to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Only two studies [Rodgers (2010) in press, Napier (2009) 1034] directly address the ILCOR question. In the study by Rodgers [Rodgers (2010) in press] looking at 34 senior nursing students enrolled in an Advanced Cardiac Life Support Course (ACLS) course, Spearman's rho correlation coefficient between the written test scores and practical skills performance was only 0.194 (significance = 0.272). Similarly the larger study (537 subjects) by Napier [Napier (2008) 1034] demonstrated a weak correlation between written tests and performance measures (the CASTest) of 0.269 and 0.336 depending on whether the assessments occurred before or after the course respectively Nadel's article [Nadel (2000) 73] is useful in suggesting there is a lack of an association of the written questions, in advanced resuscitation courses, with respect to performance but this information was not directly reported as a correlation (LOE P2). Subjects, as a group, performed well on the standardized Pediatric Advanced Life Support course test but poorly on essential resuscitation skills indicating the two measures likely do not correlate well.",

The written test however is objective, allows a wider range of subject matter to be assessed, is relatively easy to deliver and score, and therefore likely adds to the reliability of the of the resuscitation course assessment process. Further research is required to further clarify the 'ideal' testing process both in terms of assessment and driving student learning.",
