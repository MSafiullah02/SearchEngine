Indeed, humans have co-evolved with microorganisms to such an extent that it is known that normal host\u2013microbe interactions are essential for many aspects of normal mammalian physiology [1].

More recently, a mathematical approach to the subject has permitted new insights into these processes. In the 1970s the concept that infectious diseases were eradicable was entertained by many physicians in developed nations; the success of sanitation, vaccination, public health and a battery of antibiotics reassured many that humanity\u2019s greatest scourges were on the verge of extinction. Plagues and epidemics have always dwarfed the slaughter of the battlefield. In 14th-century Europe, for example, bubonic plague killed 25 million of an estimated population of 100 million. Local populations could be devastated: the village of Eyam lost 258 of 360 persons to the plague in 1665. The concentration of populations in cities and towns of Europe in the Industrial Revolution led to increased numbers of epidemics such as cholera. Typhus killed some 2.5 million Russians between 1918 and 1921; 20 million died of influenza in 1918\u20131919. The 21st century is not without its own epidemics such as the influenza (\u2018swine\u2019 flu) pandemic of 2009 or the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003. So why do epidemic or pandemic outbreaks of disseminated infection occur? There is no single simple answer to this question but the scene is set by the introduction of a virulent organism capable of dissemination into a susceptible population.",

There is no clinical illness associated with this state, and indeed the presence of such organisms may be protective to epithelial surfaces by preventing invasion by more pathogenic species. This biological state of synergy is often referred to as colonization [1]. Typical colonizing organisms are shown in Fig. 36.3\n.",

From a clinical perspective only some 400 organisms cause infectious diseases in humans, although the exact number is difficult to determine. This needs to be seen in the context of the fact that there are some 1000 species of bacteria co-habiting or colonizing each individual. An adult human has about 1013 eukaryotic cells, but there are some ten bacterial organisms for each of these, most of which are concentrated around epithelial surfaces. There is no particularly active or inflammatory immune response to the vast majority of these but it is alterations in these relationships which result in invasion. It is evident that being surrounded by bacteria is of evolutionary advantage to the human host, and indeed studies of germ-free animals suggest that the presence of colonizing bacteria and perhaps viruses is associated with nutritional and immunological advantages, and prolonged lifespan. These advantages are clearly also relevant to the colonizing species. This situation of mutual support has a number of species-specific characteristics; those organisms found normally in a sheep, cow, dog or cat are distinct from those in humans.",

In the majority of cases bacteria establish infection by crossing mucosal epithelial surfaces such as those of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.

One of the more common pathways exploited by a wide variety of organisms is via binding to intracellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs) [6]. Following adhesion the bacteria must pass through the epithelium, which may be accomplished in a number of ways (Fig. 36.4\n). Once through the epithelial barrier the organism must be able to pass through the body and evade host defences. Examples of specific cellular targets for microorganisms during adhesion, invasion and dissemination are listed in Table 36.1\nand strategies for evading host responses in Table 36.2\n. Commonly, dissemination occurs via the blood but some pathogens, such as Salmonella typhi and many viruses, are transported through the lymphatic system to regional lymph nodes where multiplication occurs. This may be followed by a phase of further lymphatic or bloodstream dissemination. In primary varicella, for example, the virus enters via the respiratory tract, replicates in the regional lymph nodes and then, 14\u201321 days after initial invasion, viraemia finally occurs, leading to the typical rash of chickenpox.",

Alternatively, the organism may multiply with potentially dire systemic consequences of severe sepsis, organ failure and death. Finally, the organism may disseminate via the bloodstream to distant sites leading to local infection such as meningitis, osteomyelitis or abscess formation. Bacteraemia may result in infection of areas of the vascular tree itself, such as a heart valve or vessel bifurcation (endocarditis) and this focus can lead to further seeding of other body sites.\n",

E. coli is one of the commonest bacteria colonizing the human gastrointestinal tract and over 170 different serogroups and 50 serotypes have been described. E. coli may lead to a wide variety of clinical syndromes including diarrhoea, urinary tract infection, pyelonephritis, bacteraemia and sepsis. Not surprisingly, E. coli isolated from these clinical scenarios exhibit different molecular determinants leading to disease. For example, gut E. coli may cause diarrhoea through a variety of mechanisms, including adherence to bowel epithelia, invasion of bowel mucosae (e.g. E. coli O157) or toxin production [8], [9]. However, these E. coli strains cause local disease and are not found in the blood. Urinary tract infections are due to E. coli that have the ability to adhere to the uroepithelium via fimbriae that express adhesion molecules that bind to specific host cellular glycoprotein receptors [10]. Isolates of E. coli from lower urinary tract infections express specific type I fimbriae. However, only those that express a different type, called P fimbriae, are able to invade the upper urinary tract, leading to pyelonephritis [10]. Finally, bloodstream isolates of E. coli from patients with severe sepsis may have entered the circulation through a number of different routes. However, variations in surface antigens and fimbriae influence the morbidity and mortality associated with infection [11].",

            "text": "It is clear from this brief description that dissemination of infection is intimately connected to the interactions between host and organism. Organisms become progressively more invasive as host defences become weaker. Dissemination is therefore one of the principal criteria defining bacterial virulence. In a healthy host the infecting organism must be able to overcome intact host defences including skin and mucosal barriers, innate, humoral and cellular immunity. These defences have evolved over many millennia and pose a formidable hurdle to invading organisms. Bacteria that can overcome such defences can be thought of as highly pathogenic. Once, however, the host is compromised, bacteria and other organisms require less pathogenic determinants to invade and disseminate. Infections by less pathogenic organisms are often referred to as opportunistic. This is discussed in more detail later but it is worth illustrating this point with the simple clinical example of bacterial meningitis. In unvaccinated young children Haemophilus influenzae meningitis is relatively common but almost disappears by age 5 as the children acquire protective antibody, usually following respiratory tract infection. In healthy young adults almost all bacterial meningitis is caused by Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus) or Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). These bacteria have the ability to adhere to and penetrate upper respiratory tract mucosae, evade killing in the bloodstream and can penetrate the blood\u2013brain barrier. If, however, the patient has a severe head injury with a skull fracture through the sinuses then organisms may gain direct entry to the CSF. Meningitis in these patients is often due to staphylococci, streptococci and Haemophilus spp. that are frequent colonizing organisms in the sinuses. If our patient has significantly impaired cell-mediated immunity, for example after organ transplantation, then Listeria, mycobacteria and fungi must be considered as potential causes.",

A high proportion of the population is colonized with N. meningitidis at one time or another. The reason why invasive disease occurs in a very small percentage of individuals remains unclear. Preceding viral infections, inhalation of dry dusty air, or exposure to passive smoking have been associated with invasive disease [12]. The presence of protective antibody appears critical in the prevention of invasive disease, whilst the production of endotoxin is one of the key pathogenic mechanisms.",

Studies of bacterial colonies show that most bacterial organisms \u2013 and probably viral ones too \u2013 demonstrate the faculty of quorum sensing [13], [14]. This allows rapid growth in situations where there is little crowding of fellow organisms, followed by slower growth whenever the local environment becomes too full of organisms of the same species. The relationship of these changes to human disease is poorly understood but may be significant in determining behaviour of a pathogenic organism. For instance, toxin production by staphylococci is rare in a growing colony of bacteria, but once colony growth is static, toxin production is activated. In contrast, Vibrio cholerae produces toxin while proliferating. Invasiveness is thought to be more likely when streptococci are proliferating rather than static, whilst other bacterial species such as mycobacteria are actually less invasive in the proliferative state. The process of quorum sensing may be extended to involve other organisms too. It is evident that the majority of colonizing organisms survive in a film of fluid and mucus above populations of epithelial cells. This environment or biofilm has characteristics which may be critical in determining the invasive potential or toxin-producing potential of an organism.",

Numerous factors may influence the nature and types of pathogens that we encounter and thus the subsequent risk of infection (Fig. 36.6\n). Thus, a healthy young adult presenting in the UK with fever and shock is likely to have bacterial sepsis due to meningococcal, streptococcal or staphylococcal infection. These are the commonest causes of community-acquired bacteraemia in the UK and in the absence of immunocompromise or other illness Gram-negative bacteria are far less common. In the same patient presenting in South-East Asia you would also need to consider Burkholderia pseudomallei (meliodosis), typhoid fever, malaria (protozoal) and dengue fever (viral haemorrhagic fever). These organisms can easily be overlooked in countries where these infections are not endemic [15]. On a more local level there are substantial differences in the types of bacteria involved in community- and hospital-acquired infection. Following admission to hospital many factors combine to alter the normal colonizing flora. These include antimicrobial therapy that kills healthy commensal bacteria and spread of bacteria through patient\u2013patient, staff\u2013patient and environmental contamination. Within a few days the flora of the nasopharynx changes from predominantly oral streptococci and anaerobes to include enteric Gram-negative bacilli and sometimes Staphylococcus aureus. Over the same period the skin may acquire antibiotic-resistant staphylococci, enterococci or Gram-negative bacilli that are uncommon in the community. Commonly this leads to no harm and the patient re-acquires normal flora following discharge. If, however, other factors lead to infection such as aspiration pneumonia, intravenous line infection, wound sepsis, etc., then the microbiology of the invading organisms is altered and antibiotic resistance more likely.",

This is a very general term and almost any infection will produce the clinical features associated with sepsis. The far more severe consequences of disseminated infection such as circulatory collapse and death have been recognized for many years [18]. Severe sepsis is defined as sepsis plus sepsis-induced organ dysfunction or tissue hypoperfusion [19] whilst septic shock is defined as sepsis-induced hypotension persisting despite adequate fluid resuscitation (Table 36.3\n). Both are major healthcare problems, affecting millions of people worldwide each year, killing one in four and increasing in incidence [19]. It is estimated that sepsis kills over 1400 people every day worldwide and 37 000 annually in the UK [20]. Within the intensive care unit (ICU) the prevalence of infection and sepsis is particularly high. The EPIC 2 study, a one-day surveillance of infection rates in ICUs worldwide, revealed a point prevalence of infection of 51% [21]. As our ability to sustain critically ill patients has increased, the prevalence of severe sepsis within hospital has also increased [22].",

Numerous factors will influence this balance, such as the particular pathogen and site of infection, co-existent disease processes and genetic factors. The importance of genetic control of the immune response to infection and inflammation is incompletely understood but is increasingly recognized. For example, one study examined cytokine release from whole blood in response to in vitro challenge with LPS. Relatives of patients who had died of meningococcal sepsis exhibited a predominantly anti-inflammatory cytokine profile with a high ratio of LPS-induced IL-10:TNF-\u03b1 production.

About 15\u201320% of cases are complicated by bacteraemia which is associated with a higher mortality. The risk of pneumococcal bacteraemia is increased by host factors such as smoking, alcoholism, old age, diabetes and immunosuppression [3], [42]. Some patients with bacteraemia will develop pneumococcal meningitis or, more rarely, deep abscesses at other body sites. The dose of antibiotics used needs to be higher when severe sepsis or meningitis is present. A similar process is seen in meningococcal disease, where initial entry occurs through the throat with bacteraemic dissemination. A proportion of patients present in this phase with fulminant sepsis, whilst others progress to exhibit infection at multiple body sites including the skin (meningococcal purpura), joints and meningitis [43].

A minority of organisms have the potential to overcome intact host defences, proliferate and cause infection. The immune response may be able to clear the infection but in some cases widespread immunological activation by bacterial products can lead to widespread tissue damage, shock and organ failure. In other cases the initial response appears to contain the organism but dissemination leads to focal infection at other body sites. Host and environmental factors influence the pattern of colonization by, and exposure to, potential pathogens. Furthermore, host factors, particularly immune impairment, significantly alter the risk and spread of infection. Further understanding of the different strategies employed by microorganisms during tissue invasion and dissemination may ultimately lead to new therapeutic strategies and help to reduce the still significant burden of infectious diseases.",
