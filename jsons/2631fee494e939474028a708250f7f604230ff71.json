The organization affirms that these requirements are based on multicenter educational trials over the past decade, which demonstrate that violations are associated with increased risk to patients and trainees. ACGME provides guidance on stages of operation within institutions based on the severity of the pandemic within each institution. Sponsoring institutions and any participating sites are set to function at one of three stages along a continuum: Stage 1: Business as usual Stage 2: Increased but manageable clinical demand Stage 3: Crossing a threshold beyond which the increase in volume and/or severity of illness creates an extraordinary circumstance in which routine care, education, and delivery must be reconfigured to focus only on patient care [2] .

Historically, healthcare professionals avoid assistance when experiencing depression and suicidality, generally due to concerns about confidentiality, stigma, costs, time, and perceived negative career implications. It is imperative to provide affordable, confidential, and convenient access to psychological services [22] . Group mindfulness sessions can be integrated into online didactic sessions to promote social connection and well-being. Further, with the elevated risk of infection among healthcare staff, many concerned trainees are requesting institutional access to legal services intended to secure financial resources for their families and ensure advance directives are clarified should incapacitation occur. Facilitating housing options is another important organizational strategy for ill trainees who do not wish to return home to avoid potentially infecting their families. Additionally, providing assistance with child care services can significantly reduce familial stress. Organizations may facilitate use of community-donated resources such as food vouchers to promote self-care and healthy nutrition. When scholarly work pursuits are feasible, assigning small, concrete educational projects that are more manageable avoids overwhelming fellows, creating a sense of accomplishment and enhancing satisfaction [22] . Burnout is also minimized by maintaining duty-hour restrictions and optimizing local work protocols when possible [26] . (Appendix 2)",

Education has evolved to allow for remote conferences with the additional benefit of increasing collaboration among institutions.

Based on these findings and the COVID-19 crisis, the Association of Pain Program Directors (APPD) issued a statement on March 13, 2020, endorsing web-based interviews to assist our future fellows and training programs during these difficult times.Section IVRESEARCHThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on biomedical research, most prevalent for research-intensive institutions. Trainees involved in research at those institutions followed the rules established in concordance with both social distancing and individual states' executive orders.Individual institutional policies on conducting research during the COVID-19 pandemic generally follow several key principles:1. Non-critical research and/or research-related activities must be performed remotely 2. Strict adherence to social distancing 3. New projects requiring in-person completion are not permitted; however, COVID-19 related research whether basic or clinical is permitted and encouraged In many institutions, laboratories have closed their doors with only essential and critical personnel allowed to enter the facilities. When research is deemed critical, a rotation system may allow a critical laboratory member to enter the facility[15]. While many laboratory research activities are conducted remotely, current active and therapeutic clinical trials are maintained.Fellows with protected time for research during their 1-year fellowship and those that have additional research time added to their fellowship face unique challenges stemming from the abrupt interruption of research activities and the indeterminate timeframe for restoring these activities.",

Animal studies are similarly reduced with only critical personnel maintained for the care and safety of the animals. New research related to COVID-19 is emerging. Program directors and research supervisors are tasked to continue mentoring and educating fellows, guiding budding researchers toward novel subjects of study and new projects that can be completed within the pandemic restrictions.",
