            "text": "Vesicular stomatitis (VS) is a highly contagious disease in swine, horses, cattle and other mammals. It is caused by the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and characterized by widely erosive vesicles on the surface of the lips, tongue, gums and teats (Letchworth et al., 1999). Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a member of the Vesiculovirus genus, which belongs to the Rhabdoviridae family. The VSV genome is composed of a single negative polarity RNA strand that encodes five proteins: nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M) protein, glycoprotein (G) and large (L) viral polymerase (Barr et al., 2002). The nucleocapsid (N) protein tightly binds to the viral genomic and nascent RNA. The polymerase L is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) that associates with phosphoprotein (P), nucleocapsid (N) and genomic RNA to form the transcriptionally active nucleocapsid (Barr et al., 2002). This complex is condensed by matrix protein (M) to generate a coiled helical structure and then enclosed within a lipid bilayer directed by the integral transmembrane glycoprotein (G) (Ge et al., 2010, Beilstein et al., 2015).",

            "text": "The matrix (M) protein of VSV is a multifunctional protein that plays an important role in the induction of cell rounding (Blondel et al., 1990), the modulation of apoptosis (Kopecky et al., 2001), the inhibition of host transcription (Black and Lyles, 1992), virion assembly/budding (Gaudin et al., 1995, Harty et al., 1999) and the blocking of nuclear-cytoplasmic transport of host RNAs (Her et al., 1997). To perform numerous functions, viral proteins may need to interact with specific host proteins. A number of M-interacting cellular proteins have been identified that contribute to these various functions during viral infection. It has been demonstrated that host E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 interacts with M protein to promote efficient virus egress (Harty et al., 2001). In addition to facilitating virus egress, VSV M protein can deregulate nucleo-cytoplasmic transport to inhibit cellular gene expression by targeting Nup98 (von Kobbe et al., 2000). Furthermore, M protein can also interact with dynamin and inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Disrupting the M-dynamin interaction blocks VSV assembly and budding and affects the cellular localization of the N and G proteins (Raux et al., 2010). In addition, M protein has been shown to be associated with host factor-Rae1, and this complex serves as a \u201cplatform\u201d to recruit cellular proteins involved in host transcription (Rajani et al., 2012). Thus, further exploration of the interaction of M with host cellular protein(s) is essential for understanding the roles of M in the replication and pathogenesis of VSV. In this study, we identified the host protein eIF3i as a novel M-interacting partner that regulates the growth of VSV.",

The EIF3 complex has been shown to affect the growth of different groups of viruses. For example, the rabies virus (RV) M protein can inhibit eukaryotic translation via a protein interaction with eIF3 h (Komarova et al., 2007). Furthermore, eIF3f can also interact with the S protein of SARS-CoV and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) to inhibit expression of host genes (Xiao et al., 2008). In addition to inhibiting host translation, eIF3f can inhibit HIV replication by specifically impeding the 3\u2032 end processing of HIV-1 mRNAs (Valente et al., 2009). However, no studies have investigated the role of eIF3 complex in the VSV life cycle. Here, we demonstrated that VSV M protein interacts with eIF3i and that this interaction affects the growth of VSV.",

Monolayers of HeLa cells grown in 6-well plates (Corning, USA) were transfected with 50 nM of mixed eIF3i-specific siRNAs (sieIF3i) using the Lipofectamine RNAiMax Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen). The knockdown efficiency was examined by western blotting. To investigate the effect of eIF3i knockdown on the replication of VSV, the siRNA-treated HeLa cells were then infected with VSV at an MOI of 1 at 48 h post-transfection. At 4, 8 and 12 h post-infection, the viral RNA copies in the cells were detected.",

Furthermore, Akt1 could modulate antiviral immunity through phosphorylation of the transcriptional repressor EMSY (Ezell et al., 2012). To determine whether eIF3i exploited these mechanisms to affect VSV replication in HeLa cells, the cells were infected with VSV and the level of phospho-Akt1 was detected at 4, 8 and 12 h post-infection. As shown in the results, VSV inhibited Akt phosphorylation at 8 and 12 h post-infection (Fig. 6\nA). To further confirm this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of eIF3i on expression of Akt/EMSY-regulated ISGs after infection with VSV, and the results showed that the knockdown of eIF3i inhibited expression of these ISGs (Fig. 6B\u2013D). We also demonstrated that VSV did not affect the level of the cellular eIF3i protein (Fig. 6E).

EIF3i not only regulates translation but is also involved in cellular signaling transduction. For instance, eIF3i was shown to interact with Akt1 and prevent PP2A dephosphorylation of Akt1 to activate Akt1 oncogenic signaling (Wang et al., 2013). By selectively increasing VEGFR2 and ERK translation, eIF3i promotes vascular endothelial cell proliferation and migration (Zhang et al., 2017). To date, the role of eukaryotic translation initiation factor in the replication of VSV remains unknown.",

Through a mutagenesis analysis, we found that some mutations in M between amino acids 122 and 181 impaired but did not completely abolish the M\u2013eIF3i interaction. To investigate the role of the M-eif3i interaction in VSV propagation, we silenced the eIF3i gene by using siRNA. The results showed that silencing the eIF3i gene decreased the replication of VSV in the early stages but promoted transcription of VSV in the late stages.

Rabies virus (RV) matrix protein can interact with eIF3 h to inhibit the expression of cellular genes (Komarova et al., 2007). In addition, the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) can interact with eIF3f to inhibit host translation. This mechanism has been exploited by coronaviruses to counteract the host-antiviral response and to modulate coronavirus pathogenesis (Xiao et al., 2008). Wataru Kamitani had reported that the nsp1 protein of SARS-Cov utilizes a two-pronged strategy to inhibit translation of host proteins: nsp1 blocked the formation of 80S by binding to the 40S ribosomal subunit and facilitated the degradation of the 5\u2032-end of mRNA degradation, rendering the mRNA translationally inactive (Kamitani et al., 2009). However, many reports showed that VSV M did not inhibit host protein translation (Black et al., 1994, Connor and Lyles, 2005, Redondo et al., 2015). However, Zackary demonstrated that VSV could inhibit the translation of mRNAs transfected prior to infection (Whitlow et al., 2008). To further confirm whether M played a key role in inhibiting the translation of mRNAs during VSV infection, HeLa cells were transfected with in vitro transcribed luciferase and M mRNAs. Our result showed that M had no effect on inhibiting the translation of luciferase mRNAs transfected prior to the M mRNA. Thus, there might be some other viral components involved in the inhibition of host translation.",

Furthermore, Ezell et al. demonstrated that Akt1 could modulate antiviral immunity through phosphorylation of the transcriptional repressor EMSY (Ezell et al., 2012). To determine whether eIF3i exploited these mechanisms to affect VSV growth in HeLa cells, we have determined the effect of VSV infection on the phosphorylation of Akt1 in HeLa cells. The results showed that Akt1 phosphorylation was inhibited in cells infected with VSV. To further confirm this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of eIF3i on the expression of Akt/EMSY-regulated ISGs after infection with VSV, and the results showed that the knockdown of eIF3i inhibited the expression of these ISGs. We also demonstrated that neither silencing the eIF3i gene nor over-expression of eIF3i could promote VSV growth in type-I IFN system-deficient Vero cells (data not shown). These results indicated that eIF3i might affect VSV growth by modulating host antiviral response in HeLa cells. In this study, we also found that knockdown of eIF3i by RNA interference decreased replication and transcription and over-expression of eIF3i increased VSV transcription in the early stages. Thus, we speculated that eIF3i might exploit other mechanisms to affect VSV replication in HeLa cells.",
