Two reviewers will independently screen each study for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. We will pool the results using meta-analysis and will apply the GRADE system to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Today, vitamin C is usually perceived as an effective, harmless and inexpensive therapeutic alternative.

Two reviewers will independently assess five domains of bias for each outcome result of all reported outcomes and time points. These five domains are: bias due to (1) the randomisation process, (2) deviations from intended interventions (effects of assignment to interventions at baseline), (3) missing outcome data, (4) measurement of the outcome, and (5) selection of reported results. Answers to signalling questions and supporting information will lead to a domain-level judgement in the form of 'Low risk of bias', 'Some concerns', or 'High risk of bias'. These domain-level judgements will inform an overall 'risk of bias' judgement for each result. Discrepancies between review authors will be resolved by discussion to reach consensus. If necessary, a third review author will be consulted to achieve a decision. We will assess the risks of bias of other study designs with the ROBINS-I tool (ROBINS-I: Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies of Interventions) [25] . We will assess the following domains: bias due to confounding, bias in selection of participants into the study, bias in classification of interventions, bias due to deviations from intended interventions (effect of assignment to intervention), bias due to missing data, bias in measurement of outcomes and bias in the selection of the reported result. We will judge each domain as low risk, moderate risk, serious risk, critical risk, or no information, and evaluate individual bias items as described in ROBINS-I guidance. We will not consider time-varying confounding, as these confounders are not relevant in this setting [25] .",
