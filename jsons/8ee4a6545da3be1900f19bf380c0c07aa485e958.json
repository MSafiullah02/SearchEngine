Some risk factors for preoperative anxiety include the age group of 1 year olds to 5 year olds, shy temperament, poor prior medical experiences, high cognitive levels, and high parental anxiety. 1, 2 The degree of preoperative anxiety can have an impact on postoperative outcomes. Unrelieved anxiety can be associated with postoperative behavioral changes, including generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, aggression toward authorities, and nighttime crying. 3 These behaviors can persist up to 1 year after surgery. 4 Other postoperative outcomes can include higher pain scores and higher requirements of pain medications after surgery for at least 3 days postoperatively. 5 Several strategies can be used to mitigate preoperative anxiety in children. Presurgical preparation programs can include site visits, videos, books, and child-life interventions. Parental presence during induction of anesthesia can allay separation anxiety. Pharmacologic intervention, such as oral midazolam, improves compliance and shows some reduction in negative behavior changes in the near term postoperatively. 6, 7 Upper Respiratory Tract Infections", "cite_spans": [{"start": 421, "end": 423, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 424, "end": 425, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 687, "end": 688, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 745, "end": 746, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 902, "end": 903, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1323, "end": 1325, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1326, "end": 1327, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SELECT PEDIATRIC PERIOPERATIVE CONCERNS Anxiety in the Pediatric Patient"}, {"text": "The pediatric patient presenting for orthopedic surgery with a current or recent upper respiratory tract infection (URI) is a complicated dilemma for anesthesiologists and surgeons.

In a subset of healthy children undergoing idiopathic scoliosis surgery, no adverse effects, such as curve progression, hardware failure, and reoperation, were found with ketorolac use. 17 Opioids Opioids often are required if postoperative pain is expected to be moderate to severe. Commonly used opioids include short-acting narcotics, like fentanyl, or longer-acting narcotics, like morphine or hydromorphone. IV dosing allows for close titration in the recovery room. Delivery postoperatively can be in the form of as-needed basis, nursecontrolled analgesia pump, or patient-controlled analgesia pump, depending on patient age and cognitive ability. 18 Oral opioids usually are prescribed once the child tolerates oral intake. Commonly prescribed oral opioids, however, should be used with caution. Many oral opioids undergo metabolism through the hepatic cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Codeine, a prodrug, is metabolized into morphine through this pathway. Tramadol is converted to its active form O-desmethyltramadol. Polymorphisms of CPY2D6 can lead to poor metabolizers of codeine, leading to lack of efficacy. Ultrarapid metabolizers of codeine, however, result in higher than intended morphine formation and possible toxicity and respiratory depression. 19 In 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a boxed warning contraindication of using codeine for postoperative pain in a subset of children. 20 The Food and Drug Administration further restricted the use of codeine in 2017 and included tramadol. Codeine and tramadol are contraindicated in all children under 12 years old and recommended against their use for children 12 years old to 18 years old with obesity, sleep apnea, or severe lung disease. 21 Still in question are the safety profiles of hydrocodone and oxycodone in children.

Increasing levels produce tonic-clonic seizures and eventual coma. As plasma levels further increase, cardiovascular signs develop. Short-acting local anesthetics like lidocaine tend to cause bradycardia and hypotension from vasodilation and myocardial depression. Cardiac arrest later ensues. Long-acting local anesthetics like bupivacaine and ropivacaine, however, may lead to ventricular arrythmias, peaked T waves, or complete cardiovascular collapse.

Blood loss is estimated to be approximately 750 mL to 1500 mL for posterior spinal fusion for idiopathic scoliosis or 65 mL to 150 mL per vertebral level. Patients with cerebral palsy have slightly elevated blood loss of 1300 mL to 2200 mL or 100 mL to 190 mL per vertebral level. Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients have the highest blood loss of 2500 mL to 4000 mL or 200 mL to 280 mL per vertebral level. 53 Other factors associated with increased blood loss include male gender, degree of kyphosis, operative time, lower body mass index, number of levels fused, and Cobb angle greater than 50 . 54-56 Rate of blood loss was shown to be greatest during the reduction and deformity correction stage at 9.08 mL/min for idiopathic scoliosis versus 3.43 mL/min during exposure, 5.05 mL/min during screw placement, and 3.28 mL/min during closure. 52 Several strategies are used to decrease blood loss and transfusion of allogenic blood products, including preoperative iron or erythropoietin, preoperative autologous blood donation, and intraoperative blood salvage. Strategies used by the anesthesiologist include controlled hypotension, normovolemic hemodilution, and use of antifibrinolytic agents. Controlled hypotension has been shown to decrease blood loss, although increases the risk of poor end-organ perfusion, including the spinal cord. Hemodilution techniques involve removing and storing patient's blood and replacing it with crystalloid/colloid prior to start of surgery. Fewer red cells are lost during surgical blood loss, and patient's own blood can be transfused intraoperatively when needed. Antifibrinolytic agents, such as epsilon-aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid inhibit the degradation of fibrin. Their use have been shown to decrease intraoperative blood loss as well. Of these techniques, intraoperative blood salvage and antifibrinolytic agents are the most widely used. 57, 58 Positioning related injuries Careful positioning of patients is paramount to reducing adverse events. Padding on pressure points from bony prominences is needed to minimize skin breakdown. Peripheral neuropathies, such as brachial plexopathy and ulnar nerve injury, usually are due to stretch or compression injury due to positioning. 59, 60 Care must be taken to reevaluate the arms as positioning may change during surgery.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 228, "end": 230, "text": "52", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 689, "end": 691, "text": "53", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1126, "end": 1128, "text": "52", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 2181, "end": 2184, "text": "57,", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 2185, "end": 2187, "text": "58", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 2523, "end": 2526, "text": "59,", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 2527, "end": 2529, "text": "60", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Blood management strategies"}, {"text": "Visual loss is a rare and devastating complication.

This contrasts with a study of predominantly adults where ischemic optic neuropathy accounted for 89% of visual losses in spine surgeries. 61 Risk factors for the pediatric patient included younger age, male gender, fusion of 81 levels, and preexisting iron deficiency anemia. 63 Although there are no data supporting specific prevention strategies, it is suggested to avoid hypotension, anemia, increased crystalloid administration, long surgical time, and head down position. 63 Frequent checks on the eyes are needed to prevent inadvertent pressure on the globe.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 238, "end": 240, "text": "61", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 317, "end": 319, "text": "62", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 392, "end": 394, "text": "63", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 567, "end": 569, "text": "63", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 650, "end": 652, "text": "62", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 775, "end": 777, "text": "63", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1012, "end": 1014, "text": "61", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1150, "end": 1152, "text": "63", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1351, "end": 1353, "text": "63", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Visual loss"}, {"text": "Anesthetic care for the pediatric orthopedic patients is uniquely challenging.
