MARV and EBOV have a zoonotic background and, except for Reston virus, are endemic in sub-Saharan Africa. Since the discovery of MARV in 1967 and EBOV in 1976, the viruses re-emerged with increasing frequency. Most of the outbreaks were dramatic but confined to relatively short time periods and small geographic areas. Between 2013 and 2015, however, an unprecedented EBOV outbreak occurred in West Africa with almost 30,000 human infections and more than 11,000 deaths.",

ER-associated GP, designated pre-GPer, contains oligomannosidic N-glycans and shows sensitivity to endoglycosidase H treatment. Oligomerization of GP occurs already within the ER early after pre-GPer synthesis (V. Volchkov, unpublished results). Pre-GPer lacks the signal peptide sequence which is co-translationally cleaved by cellular signal peptidase. The second precursor identified, designated pre-GP, represents the Golgi-associated form of GP. This precursor contains mature N-glycans and is O-glycosylated. Still within the Golgi apparatus, pre-GP is processed by proteolytic cleavage into GP1,2 consisting of the amino-terminal fragment GP1 and the carboxy-terminal fragment GP2 linked by a disulfide bond (Volchkov et al. 1998a; Sanchez et al. 1998) (Fig. 5.1). GP1,2 complexes are present at the surface of EBOV-infected cells and build up trimeric spikes on virions. Proteolytic processing of the envelope glycoprotein of filoviruses has been unnoticed for a rather long period of time, largely due to the fact that pre-GP, mature GP1,2, and the GP1 subunit have similar migration rates on polyacrylamide gels and that GP2 tends to escape detection because it partly co-migrates with the VP24 protein. We know now, however, that cleavage of GP is remarkably efficient and that unprocessed GP is not present on Ebola virions in any significant amount.\n",

Furin cleavage was assessed by the observation that cleavage efficiency was dramatically reduced when GP was expressed in the furin-deficient LoVo cell line but was fully restored in these cells by vector-expressed furin. The finding that cleavage was effectively inhibited by peptidyl-chloromethylketone containing a furin motif or by site-directed mutagenesis of the furin site further supported this concept.",

Interestingly, MARV GP contains two sites suitable for furin cleavage: R-R-K-R435 and R-L-R-R561. It appears that the second site is not used for protein processing, possibly due to conformational constraints. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that MARV GP is indeed proteolytically processed at the first furin site (Volchkov et al. 2000). Mutations introduced at the multibasic site revealed the consensus sequence recognized by furin or the related proprotein convertase PC5/6 which contains Arg at positions \u22121 and \u22124 as a minimal requirement and Arg/Lys at position \u22122 for cleavage optimization (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-75474-1_9). Thus, substitution R435L at position \u22121 resulted in a dramatic loss of cleavage, whereas mutation K434M at position \u22122 showed a reduction in cleavage efficiency (Volchkov et al. 2000).",

            "text": "A fraction of EBOV GP1,2 that is not incorporated into virions is released from the cell surface after removal of the membrane anchor by the metalloprotease TACE (tumor necrosis factor-alpha-converting enzyme) (Dolnik et al. 2004) (Fig. 5.1). Released GP1,2, designated GP1,2 delta, is present in the trimeric form which, however, is more labile than GP1,2 trimers, indicating that the membrane anchor has a stabilizing function. GP1,2 delta released from virus-infected cells activates non-infected dendritic cells and macrophages causing the massive secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and increased vascular permeability. These activities may be instrumental for the excessive and dysregulated inflammatory host reactions to infection and, thus, contribute to the high pathogenicity of the virus (Escudero-P\u00e9rez et al. 2014). There is also evidence that fine-tuning of the levels of EBOV GP expressed at the surface of infected cells via GP shedding plays an important role in EBOV replication by orchestrating the balance between optimal virion GP content and cytotoxicity caused by GP (Dolnik et al. 2015). TACE, also designated ADAM17, is a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family, a large group of zinc-dependent cell surface proteases. TACE mediates shedding of many membrane proteins and has therefore been proposed to have the function of a common sheddase. Most, but not all, substrates are cleaved between two hydrophobic residues, but neither a specific recognition sequence nor a specific secondary structure at the cleavage site appears to be required (Althoff et al. 2001).",

The structure of the EBOV glycoprotein has been analyzed in detail. Early studies gave insight into the post-fusion structure of GP2 (Gallaher 1996; Malashkevich et al. 1999; Weissenhorn et al. 1998a, b; Volchkov et al. 1992). More recently, the structure of GP1,2 trimers in the pre-fusion state has been elucidated (Lee et al. 2008; Lee and Saphire 2009). According to these studies, the trimeric spike is shaped like a chalice. The bowl of the chalice is assembled by the three GP1 subunits, and the base is formed by the GP2 subunits that cradle and encircle the GP1 trimer (Fig. 5.2). The bowl which is formed by discontinuous sections of the amino-terminal region of GP1 (residues 33\u2013226) contains residues required for binding to an endosomal receptor and is covered by a glycan cap with a cluster of N-linked oligosaccharides (residues 227\u2013310). Between the glycan cap and the carboxy-terminal end of GP1 stretches a mucin-like domain that is about 150 amino acids long and heavily loaded with O-glycans. The GP2 subunit contains the hydrophobic fusion loop, two heptad repeats typical for class I fusion proteins, and the membrane anchor (Fig. 5.1).\n",

            "text": "GP presumably initiates infection by binding to the cell surface. A number of cell surface receptors have been implicated, but none of them proved to be necessary and sufficient for viral entry. It is widely accepted, however, that filoviruses are internalized after surface attachment by macropinocytosis and transported to endosomes (Saeed et al. 2010; Nanbo et al. 2010; Aleksandrowicz et al. 2011). Within endosomes, EBOV GP1,2 is cleaved by cathepsins B and/or L which is an important step in the infection process (Chandran et al. 2005; Kaletsky et al. 2007; Sanchez 2007; Schornberg et al. 2006). Cathepsin trims EBOV GP1 from its original size (ca. 130 kDa) to an initial 50-kDa fragment, followed by further cleavage to an approximately 19-kDa species of GP1 bound to GP2 by non-covalent linkages and a disulfide bridge between C53 and C609 (Jeffers et al. 2002; Volchkova et al. 1998) (Fig. 5.1). The crystal structure suggests that the site of the final cathepsin cleavage is a loop reaching from residues 189 to 214 (Lee and Saphire 2009). This concept is supported by biochemical studies indicating that the cleavage site is located at amino acid 190 (Dube et al. 2009). Thus, the entire glycan cap and the mucin-like domain are removed yielding a glycoprotein called GPcl that contains the receptor-binding site exposed on the truncated GP1 subunit and the fusion loop on GP2 (Fig. 5.2). The endosomal receptor has been identified as the cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) (Carette et al. 2011; C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al. 2011). NPC1 is a ubiquitously expressed endosomal membrane protein involved in the fusion and fission of endosomes and lysosomes (Goldman and Krise 2010). After cathepsin cleavage and receptor binding, the GP2 subunit unwinds from its GP1 clamp and rearranges irreversibly into a six-helix bundle to drive fusion of viral and endosomal membrane (Bornholdt et al. 2016;Wang et al. 2016). It has also been suggested that cathepsins are required for a step in genome delivery following fusion triggering (Spence et al. 2016).",

Structural analysis by crystallography and small angle X-ray scattering in solution indicated that the mucin-like domains of EBOV GP project upward, whereas with MARV GP they have a more equatorial orientation. Furthermore, the glycan cap is more flexible with MARV GP than with EBOV GP. Thus, the receptor-binding site appears to be tightly masked on the surface of EBOV spikes but more exposed on the surface of MARV spikes prior to endosomal cleavage (Hashiguchi et al. 2015). This study showed also other structural differences, particularly at the putative cleavage site, which may explain previous observations indicating that, unlike EBOV, MARV does not depend on cathepsin B for endosomal GP processing (Gnirss et al. 2012; Misasi et al. 2012).",

In this respect it resembles proteolytic activation of other envelope proteins, such as the F protein of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (see Chap. 2) and presumably the S protein of coronaviruses (see Chap. 4), that are also cleaved first during exocytosis by one and subsequently upon virus entry by another enzyme. Although cleavage of pre-GP to GP1,2 and triming of GP1,2 to GPcl play essential roles in the processing of the filovirus envelope protein, it is not clear whether there is a strict requirement for furin and cathepsins, respectively. The specificity of the cleavage reactions and the proteases involved will have to be analysed in more detail in future studies. It is well known that cleavage primes a viral fusion protein for the conformational change required for activity, but it has never been shown before that fusion activity depends on removal of a large carbohydrate shield from the top of the spike as is the case with filoviruses. Another unique feature is the high amount of virus-encoded glycoproteins that are secreted or shed by proteolytic cleavage from EBOV-infected cells and may play important roles in the course of infection and in pathogenesis.",
