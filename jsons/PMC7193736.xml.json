Although the DNA/oligonucleotide microarray technology has proved to be unparalleled in its power in profiling gene expression and identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in high-throughput manner, there is a poor correlation between mRNA and protein expression and activity. This arises from regulation of mRNA translation, for example, with microRNAs, and from the involvement of posttranscriptional and posttranslational modifications (PTMs), protein\u2013protein interactions, and differences in subcellular localizations. These confounding factors have driven the development and the use of array technologies to directly study proteomes and have set the stage for the arrival of microarray-based proteomics.",

One of the concerns with the use of peptides as opposed to proteins as molecular probes is the potential loss of information as a result of the missing structural context (Mahrenholz et al. 2010). There is a much higher degree of entropy in the structures of peptides than with macromolecules such as proteins which are much more constrained. Arrays of proteins have the distinct advantage in being able to mimic their physiological counterparts through presenting full-length proteins that are likely in their native 3D conformations and with proper PTMs and associated proteins, to facilitate investigation of protein\u2013protein interactions and assay of physiological activities. However, the molecular cloning and expression of tens of thousands of protein-coding genes with optimal covalent modifications and in combination with activating subunits has been proven to be technologically challenging, which significantly hampers the development and application of protein microarrays.",

The utility of these peptide microarrays has been demonstrated in some large-scale systems biology studies on the dynamics of protein interactions in cell signaling networks as well as kineome (also known as kinome) activity profiling.

The resulting membrane-based arrays are usually at low to medium density and can be used directly for downstream assays such as antibody epitope mapping. Recently, improvements have been introduced allowing peptides either to be cleaved from the membrane using strong bases or to be recovered from individual spots as soluble peptides. For this purpose, they are synthesized on acid-labile cellulose membranes (e.g., trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)-soluble), allowing postsynthesis printing of the recovered peptides on selected array surfaces at a higher density (Zander et al. 2005; Hilpert et al. 2007).",

(1991a, b) on the basis of the addressable surface activation concept. Compared to SPOT synthesis, photolithographic synthesis of peptides on array surface is more suitable for generating high-density arrays. However, it is both laborious and expensive. It requires the use of special photolabile protected amino acid derivatives as building blocks and of photomasks through which a laser is then used to activate specific areas on the array to cleave photolabile protecting groups. Even though the technique was initially developed for peptide synthesis, it was more easily adopted for the production of oligonucleotide arrays, due to the complexity of making masks for each of the 20 amino acids for every coupling cycle, as opposed to only four bases in oligonucleotide array production (Pease et al. 1994; McGall and Fidanza 2001). In recent years, a number of modifications have been introduced, including the uses of conventional amino acids and photogenerated reagents, resulting in the improvement of efficiency and the reduction in cost for array production (Singh-Gasson et al. 1999; Gao et al. 2003; Bhushan 2006; Shin et al. 2010).",

The approach is particularly useful when multiple copies of the same array with high density are required. Furthermore, peptides can be purified after synthesis and prior to array printing to avoid any complications that may stem from peptide impurity. Various chemistries have been utilized for immobilizing peptides onto the array surfaces. One of the popular approaches is to attach N-terminal biotinylated peptides onto avidin/streptavidin-coated microarray slides (Lesaicherre et al. 2002). Covalently immobilizing peptides through a terminal Cys onto a surface functionalized with maleimide groups or disulfide is also a method that is being used quite commonly (Inamori et al. 2008). The suitability of immobilization chemistry varies according to the nature of the peptide as well as the downstream applications of the array. In our hands, attaching peptides through the N-terminal free amino groups to a surface functionalized with epoxide groups worked very well for assaying protein kinase activity (see below). Thus, it is very important and necessary to determine which strategy should be used for preparing peptide arrays already prior to peptide synthesis, according to the intended application of the resulting arrays.",

Since then, the substrate specificities for a number of protein kinases have been elucidated and refined sequentially using peptide arrays (Schutkowski et al. 2005). There are two main strategies to be deployed for determining consensus phosphorylation sequences for protein kinases. On the one hand, peptide macroarrays featuring combinatorial peptide libraries or random peptide libraries such as those on the SPOT cellulose membranes were indispensable tools for elucidating the recognition sequences targeted by the kinases for which little information on their physiological substrates is available. The availability of expanding collections of recombinant active protein kinases in the past several years has facilitated the effort in this front. On the other hand, incorporation of increasing numbers of physiological phosphorylation sites uncovered through recent large-scale mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics studies into peptide microarrays has also significantly improved the efficiency of the substrate peptide screening process.",

One of the main issues associated with the current approach is the overlapping specificity among protein kinases dictated by the promiscuity in substrate recognition, especially for the kinases from the same or related families. Phosphorylation of a peptide on each spot may represent the sum of activity of all the kinases targeting this particular peptide. Indeed, a specific phosphosite sequence may be optimized through evolution to be recognized by a panel of kinases and phosphatases and not be optimized for an individual kinase or phosphatase. Thus, under most circumstances, it is impossible to directly correlate the level of peptide phosphorylation on the array with the activity of a specific kinase. It is even more challenging when the activity of kinases in crude cell or tissue lysates is to be assessed, where the cell compartmentalization has been destroyed and the proper subcellular localization of proteins cannot be maintained.",

The algorithm was built based on the information gathered through manual analysis of close to 10,000 confirmed kinase\u2013substrate pairs for 229 typical kinases. Coupling with the alignment of the primary amino acid sequences of the catalytic domains of protein kinases, the specificity-determining residues (SDRs) were identified, and the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) was generated for each of the kinases for predicting their respective recognition sequences around the phosphorylation site. The PSSMs were then used to derive the optimal substrate peptide sequences. In total, 445 15-mer peptides corresponding to the predicted sequences with a single phosphorylatable residue (Ser, Thr, or Tyr) in the middle were synthesized and immobilized onto an epoxysilane-coated glass microarray surface. The resulting peptide microarray was made up of four identical subfields to allowing four kinase assays to be run in parallel. Phosphorylation of the peptides on the array was carried out by applying active protein kinases individually into each field under their respective assay conditions, and the extent of peptide phosphorylation was then detected with Pro-Q Diamond (Life Technologies), a fluorescent dye that had been validated to bind specifically to phosphorylated residues including Ser, Thr, and Tyr, regardless the context of sequences they are in. So far, over 200 protein kinases have been assayed. Many highly reactive and selective peptides have been identified as substrates for the kinases tested. While most of the sequences conformed to those reported previously, some novel motifs were also uncovered. Detailed analysis of the \u201chit\u201d peptide sequences is expected to reveal the prototype optimal substrate peptides unique to each kinase, which will then be further optimized for their reactivity and selectivity using an oriented peptide library approach. It is expected in the near future a peptide microarray spotted with substrate peptides that are preoptimized to each of the kinases will become available from Kinexus for kineome profiling in complex biological samples.\n",

Hence, serological mapping has become one of the most sought after applications of the peptide array technology, as it appears to have the greatest clinical potential. Peptide libraries featuring fragments derived from autoantigens, allergens, or viral proteins presented on either the SPOT membrane-based peptide macroarrays or glass slide-based peptide microarrays have been used for antibody profiling in clinical samples. The clinical potential of such analyses have been shown by their use for antibody spectrum profiling in the sera from patients infected with hepatitis B and C, with a simian\u2013human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV), the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus, and with herpes virus. This provides crucial information not only for infection diagnostics but also for the development of vaccines (Neuman de Vegvar et al. 2003; Duburcq et al. 2004; Guo et al. 2004; Andresen and Gr\u00f6tzinger 2009).",

As increasing numbers of kinase substrate peptides have been identified in recent years, peptide microarrays with the capability of screening a broad range of protein kinases have been established and used to profile the aberrant kinase activity in clinical samples as well as for monitoring the response to kinase inhibitory compounds in a high-throughput manner. This underscores the potential of peptide arrays in disease diagnosis and drug discovery (Piersma et al. 2010). Among the handful of studies reported so far in this area, Schrage et al. (2009) recently reported the activation of multiple pathways in relation to AKT/GSK3\u03b2, PDGFRB, and Src protein kinases in chondrosarcoma cells on a kinase substrate peptide array containing 1,024 peptides. Supplemented with the cell viability data in vitro, the study indicated that the Src inhibitor dasatinib is a potential treatment option for patients who are inoperable (Schrage et al. 2009). Tuynman and colleagues investigated the molecular mechanism underlying anticarcinogenic activity of celecoxib (Celebrex), a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, against colorectal cancer (CRC) using a kinase substrate peptide array with 1,176 different kinase substrate consensus sequences and found that celecoxib represses c-Met-dependent signaling, which in turn led to downregulation of oncogenic Wnt signaling in CRC, supporting the potential of targeting c-Met and Wnt signaling in CRC therapy (Tuynman et al. 2008).",
