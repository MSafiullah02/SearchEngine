The recombinant proteins were used as antigens in indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to differentiate between vaccinated and FMD-infected animals. The following parameters were determined: working concentrations of antigens and peroxidase conjugate of cattle anti-IgG, the optimum composition of blocking buffer, and the positive-negative threshold of the reaction. Tests performed with approximately 200 serum samples taken from animals of different immunity states showed that the protocol with protein 3A as the antigen (3A-ELISA) provided the most reliable differentiation. All the newly developed systems proved to outperform the commercial Chekit FMD-3ABC kit in sensitivity, and 3A-ELISA was no less specific.",

It ranks first among the most dangerous animal diseases, being able to cause epizootics and great economic loss. The outbreak of 1997 in Taiwan caused a loss of 378 million US dollars [1] . The direct and indirect loss caused by the 2001 FMD epizootic in Great Britain reached 10 billion pounds sterling [2] . Russia is constantly threatened by the penetration of this disease from bordering Asian countries. Examples are FMD outbreaks of 1995, 2000, 2004, and 2005 caused by virus penetration from China to Russia [3, 4] . For this reason, the development and improvement of methods for FMD diagnosis are directly related to the zoosanitary and economic security of Russia.",
