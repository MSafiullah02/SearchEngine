            "text": "In public places sanitary conditions are always of concern, particularly of surfaces that are touched by a multitude of persons, such as door handles in rest rooms. Similar issues also arise in medical facilities. Doors that open based on presence are common in environments such as shopping malls; however they are not suited for sensitive areas, such as toilet stalls. Capacitive proximity sensors detect the presence of the human body over a distance and can be unobtrusively applied in order to enable hidden gesture-based interfaces that work without touch. In this paper we present a concept for a gesture controlled automated door based on this sensor technology. We introduce the underlying technology and present the concept and electronic components used in detail. Novel interaction patterns and data processing methods allow to open, close, lock and unlock the door using simple gestures. A prototype device has been created and evaluated in a user study.",

            "text": "The importance of proper sanitation is a well-understood principle to help prevent the spreading of diseases. Door handles in public spaces can be used by hundreds of people in the scope of the day and may act as a source of infection by passing bacteria or different virus between persons [1] . Ideally, these surfaces should either be cleaned or contact be avoided. Automated doors are commonplace in modern environments, e.g. in front of shops, to allow easy entrance and minimize heating cost. However, these are limited to detecting the presence of persons and usually rely on a simple timer to close again. This prevents application in scenarios where the door requires more than one mode of operation, e.g. if it has to be locked and unlocked. In this paper we present a method for a gesture-based door control relying on a set of capacitive sensors that are able to detect the human body over a distance. Using a few simple hand gestures in front of an unobtrusively applicable box it is possible to control an automated door without touching any surface, thus considerable reducing associated health risks. We consider three different potential applications. Public toilets in crowded areas can be visited by a large number of persons each day and have numerous lockable stalls. There are various technologies that improve sanitation, including automated flushing and self-cleaning seats, controlled using presence sensors. However, in order to lock and unlock the stalls it is still necessary to use a handle, as mere presence sensors do not have the required expressiveness to control the locking process. This can be achieved using a set of gestures and our proposed system. The second application area is hospitals. Sanitation is a major concern here and often doors have to be controlled without the use of hands, e.g. using foot switches. The automated doors typically only allow opening and self-close after a preset amount of time. Using our system it is possible to use dedicated opening and close gestures that could be also controlled with a foot-based system. A final application would be door controls for persons with physical disabilities. When there are limitations to the fine motoric skills of the user it is possible to configure the system in a way that it can be controlled by coarse gestures that are specifically tailored to a user. On the following pages we will briefly introduce the technological basis of capacitive proximity sensors and discuss the related works before detailing the system design and gesture sets available to control the system. We will describe the components of the prototype we created, including components used. Finally, the results of a user evaluation testing the usability of the system will be presented.",

Both the sensor and the human body act as a part of an electric field that is generated with regard to a common ground. Using a simple plate condenser model this relationship can be described using the following equations for capacitance C, charge Q, electrode area A, distance between plates d, vacuum permittivity , dielectric constant and electric field strength E [7] . , Smith et al. distinguish three different measurement modes of capacitive proximity sensing of the human body [8, 9] . Transmit mode uses a dedicated sender and receiver electrode, whereas the sender is placed close to body creating a capacitive coupling, resulting the body to act as sending electrode. This allows the sender and receiver to be placed further apart. The second mode is shunt mode using a field created between a dedicated sender electrode and a dedicated receiver electrode. The human body entering this field causes a displacement current, reducing the overall capacitance that can be associated to a distance from the center point between the two electrodes. The final method is loading mode that uses a single electrode creating an oscillating electric field with regards to the environmental ground. If the human body enters this area, the capacitance of the system increases with regards to the proximity between electrode and body. The latter is used as method of choice for our proposed system. Loading mode allows for a simpler technical setup and increased detection distances on a planar and dense electrode layout.",

The microcontroller stays idle until one of the sensors' measurements exceeds a threshold value. Once that has occurred, the sensor's current ID is written into a buffer. Depending on the start-and endpoints of a gesture, e.g. when leaving and entering the interaction area, the buffer's values are matched to pre-defined sequences, similar to Dynamic Time Warping. In case no pattern was recognized, the microcontroller is turned back into idle mode and waits for the next gesture trigger. When a pattern has been recognized successfully, succeeding actions can be executed -for example opening of the door. In order to recognize gestures, sets of predefined patterns are defined a priori. These patterns contain the sequential activation orders of the four sensors. As a simple example, pattern 12341 would represent a circular gesture, whereas pattern 1111444 would represent a vertical swipe gesture. ",

We have provided the system concept and two sets of gestures that can be used to control the door. The system was implemented in prototypical form and evaluated in a study with 16 participants. The results show that the system is intuitive to use and that the subjects would strongly prefer this system to touching door handles in public toilets, indicating that this system is a viable alternative to current solutions. However, our system signifies only a first step in this direction and there are numerous improvements that can be applied to future iterations.",

It is particularly interesting to display whether a door is closed or open. We are considering using a LCD display that could provide an iconic representation of the system state if an error has occurred or if the hand is obstructing the gesture area. This feedback should ideally be available on both sides of the door. Finally, we would like to investigate other interaction systems that provide an even higher expressiveness. The Leap Motion allows for a fine detection of finger and hand locations [12] . This enables detecting actual gestures associated with doors, such as grabbing a virtual door handle or moving an imaginary key. Particularly for user groups that are often using these gestures, this might increase the intuitiveness and acceptance.",
