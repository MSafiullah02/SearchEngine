Reliability of scales was assessed using Cronbach coefficient \u03b1. Exploratory factor analysis was performed using the principal components analysis with an oblique rotation (promax).20, 21 The \u03c72 test for categorical data and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for non-normally distributed continuous variables were used in bivariate analysis. Variables of theoretical importance and those with a P value < .1 were selected for inclusion in multivariable logistic regression models to determine those factors with independent predictive value.22 The backward elimination logistic procedure was used to analyze the effect of specific interactions. Interactions between the following organizational level variables were examined: training and organizational support, training and absence of job hindrances, organizational support and absence of job hindrances, training and communication, organizational support and communication and absence of job hindrances and communication. These were identified as potential interactions of interest because of their inherent relationships in the workplace.",

To mitigate barriers, most studies used only partial measures of adherence,24, 25, 26, 32 and findings were likely overestimates of true observed adherence.

Although this relationship may have some inherent contributory bias, it may have implications for policy and practice. If organizations could designate a relatively limited number of staff to care for patients with communicable respiratory illness, this might result in better staff adherence to FPE. Other benefits of such cohorting could include the following: concentrating resources in 1 area, making it possible to designate certain equipment for use with patients and thereby reduce the risk of possible fomite transmission; facilitation of concentrated infection control activities; and the physical separation of patients from others in the hospital.39 However, limiting the number of experienced workers could also be a problem if the regular cohort of workers were to be depleted through absences because of illness or redeployment. In addition, less experienced workers caring for patients mistakenly thought to be low risk might also result in an overall increase in transmission risk.",

Because competence was measured outside of the work environment, it makes sense that it would be influenced by an individual level factor such as knowledge. Measuring competence through worker demonstration eliminates the interaction between the worker and the work environment that is so critical when measuring adherence. Of interest, the organizational variable \u201cabsence of job hindrances,\u201d although of borderline statistical significance, is quite a strong predictor of competence, with an odds ratio of 2.3.",

The utilization of a cross-sectional study design precluded the determination of causality. Self-selection bias may have been a limitation because participation in the study was voluntary. Self-selection bias was likely minimized by the high participation rate. Subject recall and social desirability bias may have been a problem given the reliance on self-report data but would have been mitigated through survey anonymity. Survey results were based on subjective data. Reliability testing for 3 of the explanatory measures fell below the acceptable range (<.70). Similar results were reported in the pilot study and are likely due to variables inherently representing multiple content domains (types of illness, modes of transmission, and types of equipment). Because of a low number of patients on respiratory precautions, adherence could not be evaluated in the observational study. Multivariable analysis of the predictors of competence found knowledge to be a significant predictor, but a wide confidence interval suggested that a larger sample size was needed.",

The most important determinants of adherence to recommended use of FPE were found to be the organizational characteristics of the workplace. As a follow-up to this study, intervention studies testing different strategies targeting these organizational dimensions are needed. Competence with recommended use of an N95 respirator for a patient on airborne precautions was examined in phase 2 of this study, and knowledge was found to be the primary determinant of competence. No relationship between self-reported adherence and observed competence was found in this study, but one could hypothesize that, whereas competence does not always lead to effective performance or adherence, it could be seen as one of its many determinants. Further research examining the relationship between competence and adherence would be valuable. This area of research is particularly important because studies of observed adherence to recommended use of FPE are logistically difficult in the acute health care sector. Finally, the examination of different methodologies for investigating adherence to FPE could be part of future research studies. Using the current methodology, we were unable to measure observed adherence but were able to measure competence. The future areas of research generated by this study provide exciting opportunities for researchers to advance the current body of knowledge on adherence to important infection control practices. It also provides opportunities to merge fields of study that have traditionally not been linked.",

Findings demonstrated that, despite the SARS experience and the resulting investment in worker protection, nurse's adherence to recommended use of FPE and competence with recommended use of an N95 respirator remains suboptimal. Whereas knowledge was found to predict competence, organizational factors and other safety climate dimensions were the primary determinants of adherence to recommended use of FPE. Interventions targeting these determinants should support the reduction of occupational transmission of communicable respiratory illness, better protect health care workers, and strengthen the workforce that is so critical to the success of our Canadian public health system.",
