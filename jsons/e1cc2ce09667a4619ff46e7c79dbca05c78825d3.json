The infectious nature of the disease was indicated by epidemiologic observations; evidence for its viral etiology came from transmission experiments with filtrates passing through 200 nm-pore membranes (1 0). In thin-sections through histiocytes, macrophages and mesothelial cells from pathologic lesions virus particles were observed electron microscopically (7, 8) ; their etiologic rBle was established recently by animal inoculation experiments of virus grown in cat peritoneal cell cultures (4).
