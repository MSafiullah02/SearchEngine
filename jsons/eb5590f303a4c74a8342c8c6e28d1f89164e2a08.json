The pocket equipment should be placed in protective covers (phones, tablets, probes). Cleaning should be done in proximal-to-distal sweeps without zigzagging.

Add a transverse probe rotation improves the visualization of consolidations increasing in the number of signs visualized (greater length of pleura visualized and constant) . . One limitation is the detection of deep lesions due to the blockage of the sonic transmission in an aerated lung, however, makes an excellent tool to observe sub J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f pleural lesions, and vertical artifacts, since most reported cases show that the posteriorinferior fields of the lung are focal points for the disease. If the pneumonia extends beyond the pleural line and the ultrasound does not provide enough clarity in order to understand the clinical course of the disease, a thorax CT scan will be needed. The ultrasound patterns found in the course of COVID-19 were significantly different to those of other lesions reported in the literature 10 .",
