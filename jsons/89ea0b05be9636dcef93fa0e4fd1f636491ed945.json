            "text": "Could discontinuous transcription be operating in these other cases? This question cannot, as yet, be answered, but some precedent does exist in systems which are otherwise totally unrelated. Transcription of the influenza virus is known to require a 5'-capped primer (10-15 nucleotides long) derived from cleavage of host mRNAs 36 ,37. Coronavirus transcripts, on the other hand, are known to have a common 5'-leader sequence which is seemingly not joined to the coding portion of the RNA by conventional splicing, again strongly suggesting discontinuous transcription 38 ,39. The fact that, in both these cases, transcription occurs by an RNA-dependent viral transcriptase may be an important distinction but they do provide a mechanistic precedent for discontinuity in primary transcripts. The observation made in Fig. 6 that a snRNA of yeast has substantial homology with the region known to be a donor splice site in medRNA, suggests that this snRNA (of unknown function) might be similarly involved in discontinuous transcription, albeit on a lesser scale (snR3 is nonessential; ref. 32) . Such activity could further provide a molecular basis for the long-standing observation that heterogeneous nuclear RNAs often possess sequences at their 5'-ends which are derived from middle repetitive DNA 4 O-42 and that such sequences might be important in the control of developmentally regulated gene expression. The testing of this interesting hypothesis in trypanosomes may now be possible.",

The encounters are assumed to be conservative, with the only restriction on Triton's final energy, -GmNmT/2aT, where aT is Triton's final semimajor axis, being that it exceed Triton's present value. The horizontal curves in Fig. 2 are Pluto's final semilatus rectum, pp = l~/ GmNm~ = apll -e~l, where ep is uto's final eccentricity, for various mT/ mp. The vertical curves are Pluto's final semimajor axis, given by (4) for m T / mp = 10 and two representative values of aT' Ascending asymptotes (with increasing a) correspond to bound orbits. For ellipses, however, p < a, so only those a p 2:: pp correspond to possible orbits. In addition, the pericentre distance, pp/ (1 + ep ), has a minimum of pp/2 for ep= I, and Triton's apocentre distance has a maximum of -2aT' Thus even for mT/mp= I, no bound orbits are possible because the final orbits of Triton and Pluto must be -intersecting ones. A descending branch of ap, for a given aT. is the locus of unbound states (with respect to Neptune). The top part of the descending branch (ap 2:: pp) corresponds to eccentricities of between J2 and I; hence these orbits are also non-intersecting and are ruled out. The bottom of the .gescending branch corresponds to hyperbolic orbits with ep>J2; hence, for large enough ep, a pericentre distance small enough to allow intersecting orbits may appear feasible. The situation is very restricted, however, as ap has a horizontal asymptote at aTmp/ m T . This limits ep to {pp/ a p + 1}'/2. Pluto's final pericentre distance remains > 2aT for m T / mp 2:: I, regardless of the choice of aT or initial a. Thus, for plausible mass ratios, and under the stipulated initial conditions, a combination of orbital interactions to reverse Triton's motion cannot be found. This conclusion, more severe than that due to momentum conservation alone, is not changed by considering tidal interaction with Neptune during the encounters. In addition, allowing the initial conditions to be set when the difference between the semimajor axes of the two 'satellites' closes to within the radius of either the sphere of influence, s, or an even wider sphere of perturbation, can bring Triton and Pluto's final orbits closer together (if Triton is the innermost of the pair), but not where H is the angular momentum, and Rp , Qp and k 2P are, respectively, Pluto's radius, specific dissipation function and potential Love number (see Table 1 ). The present angular momentum of Pluto-Charon is uncertain due to the difficulty in estimating Charon's mass, but probably lies between 2.4 and 6.6 x 10 37 g cm 2 S-I. Extraction of angular momentum would cause the Pluto-Charon system to contract and eventually coalesce. The coalesced object would then be spun down to synchronous rotation 6 \u2022 The time scale for 'fusion' and spin-down is (6) Thus collapse of the Pluto-Charon system and spin-down would occur rapidly unless Pluto-Charon orbited Neptune at a great distance (T;:: 100 Myr for a> 45R N ). These same arguments apply if the original state of Pluto-Charon was a coalesced, rapidly-rotating proto-Pluto (the angular momentum limits above correspond to primordial rotation periods between -7 and 11 h; see refs 21, 22) .",

This is an unlikely series of events. The preceding arguments effectively decouple the origin of Pluto from that of any Neptune satellite. Hence, for Triton to begin as a direct satellite and end up retrograde would require interaction with an unknown and ad hoc object. I propose a simple reversal of Lyttleton's hypothesis: instead of beginning as satellites of Neptune, Triton and Pluto originate as satellites of the Sun. The existence of large, outer Solar System planetesimals is consistent with the dynamics of planetary accretion and may even be necessary to explain planetary eccentricities, inclinations, and obliquities (see ref. 27 ). Pluto-Charon's binary status could be related to hypotheses regarding binary asteroid formation,zI.28-30 and Triton's capture could be effected by the combination of a retrograde, temporary orbit about Neptune 31 and a dissipative mechanism such as gas drag 32 . 33 \u2022 If Triton had been captured, then it should have experienced a spectacular thermal event. As QN\u00bb QT, nearly all of the orbital energy dissipated during post-capture orbital evolution is deposited in the body of Triton. Gas drag, while potentially important for capture, did not result in a major change in orbital elements, as the evolution of Triton's inclination has been moderate 32 \u2022 Calculations? show that collapse of an elliptical postcapture orbit, extending to the edge of Neptune's sphere of influence (-3,500 R N ), to one where the semimajor axis is Recent observations of the Cas-A supernova remnant have shown X-ray emissions not only from the interior, but also from a fainter 'halo' extending beyond what is normally regarded as the outer boundary, or shock frone. We suggest here that this may be due to the diffusion of energetic, charged particles out of the remnant giving rise to precursor structure of the type predicted by the theory of diffusive shock acceleration. If this is the case we are seeing thermal emission from ambient gas heated by compression and wave dissipation.",

Interstellar plasmas are typically so tenuous that cosmic rays are scattered only by the irregular structure of the magnetic field. Because the field lines are effectively frozen into the background plasma these irregularities can move relative to the bulk fluid at maximum speeds of the order of the magnetosonic speed. As Fermi 3 recognized, this is a rather unusual physical system in that macroscopic degrees of freedom, the magnetic fluctuations and their associated plasma, couple to a few individual particles. If the fluctuations are excited randomly this leads to a diffusion of the particles in momentum space which is the standard second-order Fermi acceleration mechanism. This is normally slow; however, at a shock front where the bulk plasma together with its embedded magnetic structures is suddenly decelerated (in the shock frame) the scatterers, instead of moving randomly,.",

The particles diffuse ahead of the shock into the upstream region and produce an adverse pressure gradient which decelerates the flow into the shock. This gradient also works on the scatterers at the rate -v, grad Pc, where v is the velocity of the scatterers and Pc is the energetic particle pressure; clearly, and as one would intuitively expect, those fluctuation modes which move upstream relative to the plasma are amplified and those which move downstream are damped. The energy transferred to the amplified modes can be estimated to be of the order of the Alfven Mach number of the shock times the background magnetic field energl,I3. For strong astrophysical shocks, Alfven Mach numbers of 20 or greater are expected. Thus in the absence of any dissipation, or radical change in the nature of the modes, the energy content of the fluctuations would become many times that of the background field; it seems doubtful that so much energy could be stored without various instabilities setting in which transfer excess energy to the plasma and keep the fluctuation amplitude of the order of unity, Although the details of this process are very complicated, its main features have been described by a simple mode1 13 -15 in which only the energy and momentum fluxes associated with the thermal particles (treated as an ideal non-relativistic gas), the energetic particles (treated as an ideal relativistic gas) and the magnetic fluctuations (taken to be damped backwards-travelling Alfven waves) are considered, while the shock structure is taken to be plane and steady.",
