We analyze the relation between transmission rates (estimated effective reproduction numbers) and societal mobility levels using fine-grained daily mobility data from Google and Apple in an international panel of 87 countries and a panel of all states in the United States. Reduced form regression estimates that flexibly control for time trends suggest that a 10 percentage point reduction in mobility is associated with a 0.04-0.09 reduction in the value of the effective reproduction number, R ( t ), depending on geographical region and modelling choice. According to these estimates, to avoid the critical value of R = 1, easing mobility restrictions may have to be limited to below pre-pandemic levels or delayed until other non-mobility related preventative measures reduce R to a level of 0.55 -0.7 in Europe, a level of 0.64 -0.76 in Asia, and a level of 0.8 in the United States. Given gaps in data availability and inference challenges, these estimates should be interpreted with caution.",

            "text": "By some estimates, more than a third of the global population have been subjected to severe mobility restrictions since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Numerous governments around the world have resorted to such \"lockdowns\" as their primary strategy of limiting the transmission of infection, at enormous economic and social costs. As costs escalate, and transmission rates appear to decline in some countries, a growing debate has emerged regarding when and how lockdowns should be eased, and whether it is possible to do so without unleashing additional waves of infection. An assessment of the relation between mobility restrictions and transmission rates can be of substantial value in helping to navigate this policy dilemma and in understanding the determinants of diffusion.",

These studies provide highly informative evidence from a small number of localized contexts (mainly Wuhan and France) that are highly heterogeneous, which perhaps explains their mixed conclusions. The extent to which these findings can be globally extrapolated remains unclear. An additional challenge faced by these \"before-after\" assessments is the difficulty of separating the effects of the NPIs under study from other time trending factors that can reduce transmission rates. Flaxman (2020a; 2020b) and Ku\u010dinskas (2020) make valuable progress on this front by estimating the effects of NPIs on the effective reproduction numbers using a panel of 14 European states, finding results regarding the association between NPI and transmission rates that are sensitive to the manner in which the regression model is specified. In addition, these analyses are limited to a single world region and a small number of countries.",

Given the absence of data on other forms of preventative behavior, we attempt to alleviate some of these concerns by including a host of temporal and country-level fixed effects in the regressions to absorb some of these unobserved factors, but emphasize that a great deal of caution must be exercised in interpreting our estimates as causal. We also emphasize that there is no straightforward way to infer policy prescriptions from the correlations we estimate, as policy induced changes in mobility may impact other variables which influence transmission rates. For this reason, our results do not provide definitive conclusions, but should be viewed as a first step that utilizes publicly available measures of mobility levels and transmission to study a question of enormous social import.",

Behavioral variables can include hygienic practices, mask usage rates, and dimensions of social distancing not captured by mobility (such as, for example, maintaining minimal distance between individuals and maximal room occupancy rates). Epidemiological models predict transmission rates to respond to the diffusion of the virus in the population. As one example, in standard SIR models, effective reproduction numbers rates decline over time with the fraction of susceptible individuals in the population. Environmental factors may include temperature, UV radiation, and humidity (Carleton et al, 2020) . Failing to control for these variables in the regressions may reduce the precision of the estimates, and may also bias them whenever these variables are correlated with mobility (and affect transmission rates).",

Results are similar to those in Table 1 and indicate positive and statistically significant relations between R and mobility in all four specifications. The estimates imply that a ten percentage point drop in the Apple mobility measure is associated with a decline of 0.08 -0.09 units of R , depending on the specification used. Table 3 examines the relation between transmission rates and mobility levels in an analogous manner, but uses the state-level panel dataset in the United States. Transmission rates are taken from Systrom and Vladeck, 2020, and mobility is measured either by Google workplace mobility, or Apple driving mobility indicators. All regressions include state-level fixed effects and either date fixed effects or state-level time trends. As can be seen, similar to the global analysis, the results in the United States indicate a positive relation between transmission rates and mobility levels. Focusing on Column 1, which is most similar to our benchmark global model (i.e., with country and date fixed effects), the estimates suggest that a 10 percentage point reduction in mobility levels is associated with a 0.04 decrease in the value of R . The size of the effect is rather similar to that in the benchmark global estimate (0.06) despite the fact that the estimates of R ( t ) used in the two regressions are derived by independent methods and researchers.
