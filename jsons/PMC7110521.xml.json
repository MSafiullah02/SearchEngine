Although some desert passerines (e.g., zebra finches) have been known to survive months without drinking water, the smallest passerine birds drink from 250 to 300 mL/kg BW daily and can eat up to 30% of their BW daily.13 This is much more than the generally advised 40 to 60 mL/kg BW for larger parrots.1 For an average parrot of 500 g with a basal metabolism of 46 kcal/day, the amount is about 0.5 mL/kcal/day. It might be wise to use this amount of total water intake as a starting point for these small birds. Using the dose in mg/kcal and a drinking water intake of 0.5 mL/kcal, the drug concentration per liter will be independent of the species and therefore the same for all birds (\nTables 2 and\n3). This is a good starting point when no experimental data are available. The daily water consumption, however, is very much influenced by environmental temperature, type of diet (e.g., fruits), and original habitat of the bird (desert). When using this information for calculating the drinking water concentration for the treatment of flocks of finches, the owner should always measure the actual intake and adjust the concentration to reach the desired average drug intake per kcal for the birds being treated.",

The weanlings are housed in communal flights with or without outside quarters. In the winter season (resting season) the male and female birds are housed as separate groups in pens. For treatment purposes, this means that all birds are the same species and have the same average BW and water intake. They are also sensitive to the same infectious agents, and all birds must therefore be treated at the same time. The movement of birds in and out the aviary for shows includes the risk of introducing outside infection. Adequate cleaning of the facility, because of many small cages, is sometimes difficult.

This can cause disappointing therapeutic results and the development of resistance. Medication in water can be successful against mild infections of the gastrointestinal tract, in which the drug has a local effect in the gut. Administration of drugs in the drinking water is particularly not recommended in softbills and fruit-eating finches because they generally do not consume large quantities of water; instead, they obtain most of their daily fluid requirements from fruits. Oral administration in softbills (and some larger passerines) can be administered directly, by metal or rubber gavage tube, or by placement of a capsule or granules in the center of a grape.",
