This chapter summarizes some of the most important issues for the management of smallpox. Usually, the strategy for the management of clinical cases of poxviruses includes the early detection of cases, rapid laboratory diagnosis, an assessment of the risk of further spread and containment measures. For the early detection, different systems are being tested to identify suspected cases before a diagnosis is confirmed (e.g., syndromic surveillance). Also it is necessary to provide special training on the disease pattern, including differential diagnosis, to clinicians and practitioners. If a suspected case has been identified, rapid diagnostic tests are required. In addition to the national and international notifications based on given case definitions, certain measures are necessary to allow an initial risk assessment of the epidemic development. For a rapid risk assessment, the investigations should follow the algorithms of epidemiological outbreak investigation such as the tracing and identification of exposed contacts and the sources of infection. Further decisions have to be taken on the basis of a continuous risk assessment. Countermeasures can be divided into medical and non-medical ones. The choice of an adequate vaccination strategy as a medical countermeasure for the case of a re-emergence of smallpox very much depends on the epidemic scenario, and the general availability and quality of a vaccine. Logistic aspects of the vaccination strategies have to be considered in preparedness planning (e.g., resources necessary for the implementation of mass vaccinations), and also the prioritization of groups to be vaccinated. In addition non-medical measures to prevent the spread of infection, such as the isolation of cases and quarantining of exposed persons (e.g., contact persons of confirmed cases) have to be foreseen. The effectiveness of other measures like prohibition of mass gatherings or closure of institutions is often assessed in the light of historical events. However, they have to be considered within today's ethical and societal context, taking into account, in particular, the increased number of people who are immunocompromised. Since our knowledge of how the virus would behave today is limited to extrapolations from historical data and is therefore imperfect, these measures are still under discussion. All relevant groups should be involved in exercises to assure the effective operation of the plan mainly regarding communication and cooperation.",

Apart from rare events like the outbreaks of monkeypox in the Democratic Republic of Congo or in the USA [1, 2] , there has been no need to think about the management of this disease anymore. However, the threat of smallpox being used as a means of bioterrorism has forced reconsideration of the need for smallpox vaccinations and other measures to manage potential cases or outbreaks of smallpox. In the past few years, many countries have developed preparedness plans for smallpox. In the following chapter we have tried to summarize some of the most important issues for the management of smallpox. A full description of all the necessary parts of the preparedness plans would go beyond the space available here.",

Yet, these systems usually detect outbreaks or unusual epidemic developments only with a certain time delay. Therefore, planning considerations include concepts that identify an attack as early as possible [3] . Among such systems are for example strategies to monitor the number of emergency department visits, over-the-counter medication sales or school absenteeism. Also, environmental monitoring systems like air samplers, which permanently test the air for threat agents to detect a biological agent before it causes symptoms, have been suggested. Since they only cover selected areas and have to be analyzed against a background noise, they do not necessarily guarantee a timely recognition of a biological threat [3] . After 11th September 2001, various models of syndromic surveillance have been established and tested in the United States for different syndromes (e.g., [4] ), but they also still need to prove their value in detecting a bioterrorist attack in a timely manner. Most likely a deliberate release of smallpox would not be detected unless one or more human cases with clinical symptoms of the disease occurred.",

            "text": "A way to minimize the adverse events of smallpox vaccination might be the use of modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), which was developed in the 1970s by more than 500 passages in chicken embryo fibroblasts [24] . However, smallpox had been eradicated before the efficiency of the protective effect of MVA could be tested. Experiments with animals indi-cate that there may be fewer complications after vaccination with MVA [25] [26] [27] , and show also that MVA provokes a high antibody titer and a high concentration of IFN--positive cells. Some data show that MVA-vaccinated animals are protected against smallpox infection [26, 28] , but other results allow the interpretation that a MVA-vaccination alone can not guarantee a full protection against infection [25] . MVA might be a good candidate for a pre-immunization [25] or for persons with strong contraindications [26, 29] . Other replication-deficient VACV strains have also been developed for immunization [14, [30] [31] [32] . Some MVA strains currently under development require a higher virus titer as they do not replicate in the human body.",
