For example, if a paper is co-authored by four authors from three different countries, all these three unique countries will get one full credit. We merge England, Scotland, Wales, and North Ireland into the United Kingdom. Since article and review are two most important document types in terms of the academic value, this study will treat these two document types separately in scenario 2 and 3. The data were accessed on April 25, 2020 via the library of Xi'an Jiao Tong University. Table 1 shows the document type distribution of the whole SCI database, publications from the United States, and publications from China during the past two decades. The top 10 document types in SCI database are listed in descending order. Marked difference exists among the three groups. Article is the prominent document type with the relative share of 70.24% in the SCI database, followed by meeting abstract (15.76%), editorial material (4.70%), review (4.22%), and proceeding paper (4.19%) 1 .",

Interestingly, the document type distribution of the SCI-indexed publications contributed by China is quite different from the previous two groups. Over 90% of China's SCI-indexed publications are original articles, which is much higher than the previous two groups. Contrarily, meeting abstracts only take a share of 3.88% among all China's publications, which is only one quarter of the world average. Lower presence rates also exist for many other document types.

The latest reform in China may also decelerate the rapid growth of China's SCI publications (Liu 2020) . However, the number of junior researchers who can publish in English is also increasing. We still predict that China will overtake the United States as YEAR USA China the largest contributor to SCI-indexed publications in the following one or two years (all document types are considered). However, the cross-over between China and the United States cannot be misinterpreted or overinterpreted. The United States will continue to be the global scientific leader for a long time (Tollefson 2018) .",
