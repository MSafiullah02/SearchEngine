Frequent, structured communication in the form of huddles plays an integral role in mitigating this risk. A recent article described the value of bringing together stakeholders to plan safe patient transport and the process of getting the patient onto the operating room table. 9 Huddles should include surgeons, the anesthesia team, intensive care unit (ICU) attendings and nurses, respiratory therapists, operating room (OR) nursing staff, environmental services, security, and members of infection control. To standardize this process, hospitals have developed transport protocols for the operative team 10, 11 and are performing transport simulations to prepare for high numbers of potential patients. Open communication between the surgical team and peri-operative staff allows the group to transfer high-risk patients from wards to the OR and back with reduced risk to the team.",

This time interval is based on the number of air changes per hour as described by the CDC. 13 Items such as hospital charts, pagers, and cell phones must be left outside the OR with contingencies to respond to time sensitive pages. Additionally, anything that was in contact with the patient, such as the ward bed, should also be considered contaminated.
