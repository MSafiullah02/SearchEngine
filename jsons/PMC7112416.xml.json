The spread of infections like HIV, hepatitis viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), etc., through contamination, has created increased pressure for the protection of the personnel with antimicrobial clothing. Therefore, surgical fabrics should necessarily possess antimicrobial properties (Ambika and Sundrarajan, 2015, Mucha et al., 2002, Vaideki et al., 2008). The antimicrobial fabric when applied as wound dressings, it not only act as normal wound dressing but also provide hygienic atmosphere around the wound (Raghavendra, Varaprasad, & Jayaramudu, 2015). Generally, the fibre used in the wound dressing functional clothing contains cellulose, a homopolymer of \u03b2-d-glucopyranose units linked together by (1 \u2192 4)-glycosidic bonds (Raghavendra, Jayaramudu, Varaprasad, Sadiku, Ray, & Mohana Raju, 2013). The three-hydroxyl groups in the cellulose acts as bonding sites for the external entities (Gardner, Oporto, Mills, & Samir, 2008).",

Among the various metal nanoparticles, silver nanoparticles were extensively studied because of their potential anti-bacterial properties (Kolya, Pal, Pandey, & Tripathy, 2015). However, the use of silver nanoparticles for medical applications is potentially limited due to their genotoxicity towards mammalian cell and their non-specific biologicaltoxicity (Nagender Reddy et al., 2009, Gardner et al., 2008). Alternatively, ZnO serves as an effective entity for devastating the microbial growth. Moreover, the raw material required for synthesis of ZnO is available at lower cost.",

The antimicrobial efficacy of the ZnO\u2013SACNF fibres was tested against Gram-negative bacterium E. coli. The inhibition zone for all the fibres was found to be in between 2.1 and 3.6 mm, shown in Fig. 6\n. According to the Standard Antibacterial test \u201cSNV 195920-1992\u201d, specimens showing more than 1 mm microbial zone inhibition can be considered as good antibacterial agents (Pollini et al., 2009, Raghavendra et al., 2013, Raghavendra et al., 2014). In the present investigation, the inhibition zones exhibited by cellulose fibre, ZnO\u2013SACNF1, ZnO\u2013SACNF2 and ZnO\u2013SACNF3 against E. coli were 0.0, 2.1, 3.2, and 3.6 mm, respectively. Hence, the developed ZnO\u2013SACNF from the current approach can be considered as good antibacterial agents and effective in killing the microbes. Further, it can be noticed that when pure cellulose fibre showed no inhibition zone, the fabricated fibres showed the inhibition zones of the order: ZnO\u2013SACNF1\n < ZnO\u2013SACNF2\n < ZnO\u2013SACNF3. This order is quite expected and seemed to be in accordance with the amount of nano ZnO present in ZnO\u2013SACNF fibres. It was concluded from the TGA analysis that the nano ZnO content proceeding increases with the increase of SA. Hence, the observed inhibition zones were also exhibited the similar trend and proved the results were in proportional with the nano ZnO content. The particular mechanism of the antimicrobial activity of ZnO is still a matter of dispute. Some researchers consider that it might be a consequence of the generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on its surface (Trandafilovi\u0107 et al., 2012).",

The possible zinc oxide nanoparticles were synthesized by precipitation method. The synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles possess rods-like shape alignment with an interplanar d-spacing of 0.246 nm corresponding to the (1 0 1) planes of hexagonal wurtzite structure acquiring an average particle size 25 \u00b1 5 nm. The successfully fabricated ZnO\u2013SACNF showed excellent antibacterial activity against E. coli. Hence, from the viewpoint of biomedical applications, the fabricated ZnO\u2013SACNF fibres may be utilized as antibacterial fabrics for wound dressing applications in the bacterial prone zone.",
