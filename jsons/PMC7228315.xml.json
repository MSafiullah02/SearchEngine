The VGG first released global vaccination guidelines for veterinarians in 2007 and these were updated in 2010 and 2016 (Day et al. 2016) and translated into multiple languages. The main body of the WSAVA vaccination guidelines are most applicable to pet cats and dogs living predominantly in and around their owners' homes (rather than living 100% outdoors or in large, closely\u2010packed groups), but advice is also given on vaccination in a shelter setting. The 2010 and 2016 revisions were accompanied by a separate document providing information on vaccination for the owners and breeders of dogs and cats and by a series of infectious disease \u201cfact sheets\u201d designed to be used by veterinarians during consultation with clients (https://www.wsava.org/guidelines/vaccination-guidelines).",

Following from the success of that project the VGG embarked on a second regional project in Latin America (LATAM) between 2016 and 2019. The present paper represents the final outcome from this LATAM project. It summarises the key challenges faced by small companion animal veterinary practitioners in LATAM and makes a series of recommendations for future actions that might benefit the profession, pet owners and dogs and cats in these countries.

A 2016 survey by GfK Global of 27,000 consumers in 22 different countries revealed that LATAM has the highest level of global pet ownership. Eighty percent of the online population surveyed in Argentina and Mexico, and 75% of the surveyed population of Brazil, owned a pet. Of the pet owners, 66% in Argentina, 64% in Mexico and 58% in Brazil owned dogs and 32, 24 and 28%, respectively, owned cats (https://www.gfk.com/fileadmin/user_upload/country_one_pager/NL/documents/Global-GfK-survey_Pet-Ownership_2016.pdf). There are no accurate figures for national dog and cat populations. In 2014, there were an estimated 52.2 million dogs and 22.1 million cats in Brazil (Concei\u00e7\u00e3o 2016) and Argentinian KoLs estimated up to 10 million dogs and 3 million cats in Argentina. In some regions, many of these animals will be free roaming rather than being owned\u2013housed pets. With such growth should come an increasing demand for veterinary services and preventive health care for companion animals, including providing protection from infectious disease for the individual animal and animal population (\u201cherd immunity\u201d) by vaccination.",

Sixty\u2010three of these are in state\u2010 or federally\u2010funded public universities with the remainder being in the private sector. There are no centralised national curricula and the content and standard of teaching appears to be very variable.

The microscopic agglutination test (MAT) is the diagnostic test of choice for canine leptospirosis; however, it has poor ability to confirm the infecting serovar. Studies involving isolation of leptospires from dogs are recommended for epidemiological purposes, as well as for selection of antigens for diagnostic assay development and vaccine design (Sykes et al. 2010) [EB1]. During the VGG visits to LATAM countries, another commonly reported situation was the diagnosis of leptospirosis based on testing a single blood sample, sometimes considering the serovar with the highest titre as that causing the infection. Although, in the presence of clinical signs, a single titre \u2265800 can suggest infection, it cannot confirm a diagnosis. MAT must be performed with paired serum samples collected 1 to 2 weeks apart. A fourfold change in titre supports a recent infection (Sykes et al. 2010) [EB1]. The serogroup with the highest titre has been interpreted as the infecting serogroup; however, the highest MAT titre can vary over time, indicating that the MAT does not reliably predict the infecting serogroup in acutely infected animals (Schuller et al. 2015) [EB1]. Another problem in LATAM countries is the lack of standardisation and quality control in laboratories performing MAT for diagnosis of leptospirosis, resulting in variation in results.",

All of these factors make it very difficult for veterinarians in LATAM to vaccinate in accordance with the current WSAVA global vaccination guidelines. In particular, the delivery of core vaccines to adult dogs and cats no more frequently than every 3 years is challenging when it is not possible to obtain three\u2010component core vaccines (e.g. a combination of CDV, CAV and CPV2 or a combination of FPV, FHV1 and FCV) and these are admixed with multiple non\u2010core antigens in large multicomponent combinations. The challenge is compounded when the licensed duration of immunity (DOI) for individual core antigens is 1\u2010year, when the identical products in other markets carry a minimum DOI claim of 3 years. As we have found elsewhere, there was a reluctance to accept that a 1\u2010year licensed product might be used \u201coff label\u201d every 3 years (with informed client consent) even though the identical product is authorised in this way in other regions. This \u201ctransition stage\u201d in the use of core vaccines was more readily embraced by veterinarians in North America and Europe than it has been, or likely will be, in markets such as LATAM.",

The concepts of the \u201cannual health check\u201d and incorporating vaccination into a preventive health care programme for the individual pet (a practice \u201chealth care plan\u201d) were novel to many members of the veterinary community in LATAM. Because of the perceived reliance on vaccine sales for underpinning practice income, there is also a current culture of \u201cmore is better.\u201d Veterinarians almost exclusively deliver vaccination on an annual basis, using the vaccine product that contains the greatest antigen combination. Clients have been accustomed to visiting their veterinarian annually for a \u201cvaccine booster.\u201d Annual administration of large multicomponent vaccines are deemed preferable because the client has been led to expect that this approach is superior. We were told repeatedly that veterinarians would \u201close their clients\u201d if they did not offer annual multicomponent vaccination with the highest number of antigens possible. There is something of a \u201cvicious cycle\u201d to this concept, because manufacturers continue to supply and promote multicomponent products that may include (for the dog) anything up to 10 different antigens.",

The project is managed by the Comit\u00e9 Latinoamericano de Vacunolog\u00eda en Animales de Compa\u00f1\u00eda (COLAVAC) and aims to produce vaccination guidelines that consider the epidemiological and cultural idiosyncrasies of veterinary practice in LATAM. The establishment of COLAVAC is entirely within the spirit of WSAVA vaccination guidelines. The 2016 WSAVA guidelines clearly state that \u201cThese guidelines are not a mandatory edict, but rather should be used by national associations and individual veterinary practices to develop vaccination schedules relevant to the local situation.\u201d COLAVAC is, therefore, an example of precisely that recommendation and we congratulate FIAVAC on this important initiative. COLAVAC guidelines have now been released for Brazil, Argentina and Mexico (http://www.fiavac.org/guias.php) and recently, in a scientific journal, for Peru (Rubio et al. 2018); however, readers will note that the guidelines differ in their recommendations for use of the same vaccines in the three countries, and sometimes differ from the recommendations made by the VGG in the present manuscript. There are some important reasons that might account for the latter observation and these relate to the ideal working practices for an expert group that produces practice guidelines. Firstly, such expert groups must be completely independent of industry and should not include industry representatives on committees or have input or right of veto from industry sponsors. As readers may see from the Conflict of Interest statement that ends the present manuscript, the VGG is considered an entirely independent academic committee. Secondly, guidelines should be evidence\u2010based and supported wherever possible by peer\u2010reviewed published scientific literature. The VGG developed an evidence\u2010based hierarchy for the science of vaccinology (Day et al. 2016), which is applied to its global and now regional guidelines. Finally, guidelines documents themselves should undergo scientific peer\u2010review and be published in a creditable scientific journal rather than an industry magazine. VGG documents have always undergone such independent scrutiny and are published in the official scientific Journal of the WSAVA, the Journal of Small Animal Practice.",

There are clearly some distinctive aspects of infectious disease epidemiology in LATAM, in particular the observed higher prevalence of feline retroviral infections. Only by generating current surveillance and molecular phylogeny data will there be advances in clinical diagnostics, vaccine availability and disease control. As we suggested in Asia, there may be mutual benefit to academic researchers in veterinary schools working more closely with industry in order to generate clinically relevant data that might be used to introduce new vaccine products into LATAM for the benefit of the profession and the animals for which we care.",

This relates very simply to the lack of minimal\u2010antigen product ranges that are widely available in North America, Europe and other markets, and enable veterinarians in those countries to vaccinate in accordance with WSAVA guidelines. Until there is a shift away from large multi\u2010antigen vaccines (containing anything up to 10 different antigens) towards trivalent or bivalent core vaccines with monovalent or bivalent non\u2010core vaccines, it will be challenging for LATAM practitioners to embrace the new standards in vaccinology that are now well\u2010embedded in many other markets. Once such product ranges are more widely available (currently only in Argentina), it will then require significant education as to how they are best used in practice and a radical change in ethos to embrace the concept of preventive health care delivered through an annual health check or health care plan, as opposed to the deliberate marketing of vaccine products as commercial drivers of central importance in veterinary practice.",

Understanding the concept of core versus non\u2010core vaccines is fundamental to application of the vaccination guidelines in practice. Core vaccines are those that every dog, regardless of location or lifestyle, must receive for protection against infections that cause significant morbidity or severe or fatal disease. Core vaccines contain CDV, CAV2 and CPV2, preferably as modified live viruses (modified live vaccine; MLV). In countries where canine rabies remains an endemic disease, inactivated rabies vaccine is also regarded as a core vaccine for every dog. Non\u2010core vaccines are those considered for individual animals whose geographical location or lifestyle puts them at risk for specific infections. Non\u2010core vaccines are not required for every animal and should not be used where there is no evidence for existence of a related disease or when the risk for exposure is minimal. Non\u2010core vaccines include Leptospira vaccines and vaccines designed to protect against elements of CIRDC, which usually contain B. bronchiseptica with or without CPiV. The WSAVA global guidelines classify some vaccines as not recommended for any dog because there is insufficient scientific evidence to justify their use. These include the inactivated canine enteric (non\u2010pantropic) coronavirus (enteric CCoV) vaccine and the Giardia vaccine when used to either prevent or treat infection.",

The guidelines also recommend that a final MLV core vaccine is given between 6 months to 1 year of age in order to ensure that all puppies receive at least one dose of vaccine that is able to confer immunity in the absence of MDA [EB4]. Development of protective immunity is not dependent on the number of MLV core vaccines given during the puppy vaccination series, but rather when they are given. For adult animals, there is ample evidence supporting revaccination with quality\u2010assured international MLV core vaccines no more frequently than every 3 years (Abdelmagid et al. 2004, Bohm et al. 2004, Mouzin et al. 2004, Gore et al. 2005, Schultz 2006, Larson & Schultz 2007, Mitchell et al. 2012, Killey et al. 2018) [EB1]. While regulatory authorities in LATAM countries require annual revaccination with international MLV core vaccines licensed elsewhere for use at 3\u2010year intervals, this practice is regarded as inappropriate use of client financial resources that are better applied to annual wellness examinations, routine parasite prophylaxis, and treatment of medical issues. Increasing the frequency of vaccination with MLV core vaccines does not confer greater protection to an individual animal. Increasing the number of animals that are properly vaccinated is much more important to ensure protection through population or \u201cherd\u201d immunity than vaccinating each animal more often. Even though the 3\u2010year DOI datasheets for quality\u2010assured international MLV core vaccines are not currently accepted by LATAM countries, the VGG encourages the national and local regulatory authorities to permit practitioners to use these vaccines according to the WSAVA guidelines as \u201coff\u2010label use\u201d products with informed client consent.

CVL is widespread from Mexico to Argentina, with autochthonous cases reported in many countries (Marcondes & Day 2019) [EB1]. Although vaccines can prevent active infection and the risk of development of clinical disease in some dogs, some vaccinated dogs can become progressively infected and transmit the parasite to the sand fly vectors even in the absence of clinical signs (Bongiorno et al. 2013, Fernandes et al. 2014, Oliva et al. 2014, Regina\u2010Silva et al. 2016) [EB1]. Therefore, for animals living in endemic areas, from an epidemiological viewpoint, it is more important to use insecticides, especially collars, to prevent sand fly bites, than it is to vaccinate (Sev\u00e1 et al. 2016, Lopes et al. 2018) [EB1]. Whenever possible, the two measures should be combined, in order to provide a high level of protection not only for dogs, but for other animals and people that share the same environment. It is important to highlight that a previous history of vaccination does not exclude a diagnosis of CVL in dogs with clinical signs or clinicopathological abnormalities suggestive of the disease.",

There are, however, remaining \u201chot spots\u201d for disease and low numbers of individual cases are recorded in countries with good overall control. In most LATAM countries there is ongoing surveillance and legally\u2010mandated annual canine rabies vaccination. This may be delivered by mass vaccination field campaigns run by government or non\u2010governmental organisations or through the veterinary practice for individual client\u2010owned pet animals. Vigilance and continued vaccination to maintain herd immunity are essential at this time for maintaining control of canine rabies. As discussed above, there is a disconnect between the law and the science pertaining to rabies vaccines. There is no doubt that in mass vaccination field campaigns (particularly where these aim to vaccinate free roaming stray or community owned dogs) annual revaccination is essential to account for population turnover. However, for a client owned, veterinarian\u2010visiting individual pet animal, vaccination with an international quality\u2010assured canine rabies vaccine should confer a minimum 3 year duration of immunity (Day et al. 2016) [EB1].

These vaccines protect against infectious agents that can cause severe illness or death, especially in kittens. In all countries, vaccines against FPV, FHV1 and FCV are considered core (Scherk et al. 2013, Day et al. 2016) [EB1]. In countries where rabies is endemic, rabies vaccines are also regarded as core (Scherk et al. 2013, Day et al. 2016) [EB1]. In addition, there are non\u2010core vaccines. Not every kitten or cat need necessarily receive every one of the non\u2010core vaccines. Use of these vaccines should be based on an informed risk\u2013benefit analysis, based on knowledge of local disease frequencies and the lifestyle of the individual cat (Day et al. 2016) [EB1]. Non\u2010core vaccines protect against infectious agents that may be encountered frequently in some areas, but are known to be rare or absent in other places (e.g. FeLV). Some non\u2010core vaccines (e.g. those against C. felis infection) protect against disease agents that are generally less pathogenic than those covered by the core vaccines or are treatable using antibiotics.

As a precaution, revaccination every 3 years is generally recommended. Vaccinating more frequently than every 3 years with high\u2010quality MLV FPV vaccines is unlikely to provide any improvement in the degree of protection provided by these vaccines and may increase the risk of adverse reactions. It is far more important to ensure that a large proportion of the target population is vaccinated (i.e. to increase the overall herd immunity) than it is to increase the frequency of revaccination of individual animals in the population at risk. Indeed, the unhelpful annual revaccination of cats against FPV with products, known to provide many years of protection, should be viewed as poor use of potentially limited client financial resources.

There has been a progressive move away from the concept of the \u201cannual vaccination booster\u201d or the \u201cvaccine booster consultation\u201d towards the implementation of holistic preventive health care packages delivered in part by an \u201cannual health check\u201d consultation. In more developed markets, this has now been extended to delivery of a practice \u201chealth care plan\u201d for which a client might pay a regular monthly fee to cover numerous elements of preventive health care for their pets. The annual health check consultation is considered to require a longer period of time than a general consultation and provides the opportunity for the veterinarian to engage with the client to discuss in detail the overall health and wellbeing of the companion animal family member. Elements of the health check consultation (or of an annual health care plan) might include consideration of nutrition, dental health, behavioural issues, endo\u2010 and ectoparasite control, vector\u2010borne diseases testing and which vaccines (core or non\u2010core) might be delivered during this annual visit. Indeed, in many mature markets, annual assessment of the need for core revaccination (CDV, CAV and CPV2 for dogs and FPV for cats) is now determined by in\u2010practice serological testing (\u201ctitre testing\u201d) to determine whether an animal is already protected and therefore need not be revaccinated. The WSAVA global vaccination guidelines mention the value of serological testing and provide strong support for this approach. There is increasing literature to support the use of such serological tests in veterinary practice (e.g. Killey et al. 2018) [EB1]. Moreover, there is a substantial literature that evaluates the annual health check consultation and advises on the content, timing and approach to such a consultation (e.g. Belshaw et al. 2019) [EB1].",

This is because there is generally high population turnover in free\u2010roaming dog populations and annual revaccination is required to maintain herd immunity levels of 70% [EB1].\n18. Is there a relationship between bodyweight and amount of antigen in a vaccine? Should smaller dogs receive less vaccine than larger animals?\n",

            "text": "This is a frequently asked question throughout the world. Vaccines are unlike pharmacological drugs and are not administered on a mg/kg basis. Vaccines contain a defined amount of antigen, which is the amount required to stimulate a primary or secondary immune response in an animal. Each individual person and animal has an \u201cimmunological repertoire\u201d of antigen\u2010specific T and B lymphocytes defined by T\u2010cell and B\u2010cell receptors (TCRs and BCRs). Burnett's \u201cclonal selection theory\u201d proposed that each T and B cell carried a unique receptor specificity, but we now know that any one receptor is capable of recognising multiple epitopes (TCR \u201cdegeneracy\u201d and BCR cross\u2010reactivity). Any vaccine must therefore contain antigenic epitopes capable of being processed and presented to TCRs, or recognised conformationally by BCRs, and the aim of the vaccine is simply to be recognised by relevant antigen\u2010specific lymphocytes such that these cells are stimulated to generate active immunity and immunological memory. It is therefore irrelevant how large or small the target animal might be; the vaccine simply needs to be able to activate the correct cells in the immunological repertoire. Vaccines are formulated with a sufficiency of antigen to achieve that aim. Having said that, there is some evidence that dogs of low bodyweight do tend to make higher serological responses to some antigens (Kennedy et al. 2007) and do have a higher incidence of post\u2010vaccinal adverse events than larger dogs (Moore et al. 2005) [EB1]. However, at this time, there is no suggestion that vaccines will be formulated on the basis of bodyweight. In North America, some vaccines are available in 0.5 mL rather than 1.0 mL volumes, but the antigenic content of these products is similar. You should never split a vaccine dose between animals or administer anything less than a full dose of vaccine to an animal. This is \u201coff label\u201d use of the product and you would be liable if that animal subsequently developed infection post vaccination.\n19.

In Europe it is now illegal to sell puppies that are under 8 weeks of age. The veterinary profession in LATAM should take ownership of this welfare issue and educate dog breeders as to appropriate times for weaning. Bringing together litters of puppies aged 4 to 6 weeks at weekend \u201cpuppy markets\u201d is also a \u201crecipe for disaster\u201d in terms of infectious disease transmission and it should also be beholden on the veterinary profession to address this welfare issue. If the bitch that has produced the litter was well\u2010vaccinated, it is likely that she will have a high concentration of serum antibodies against core antigens (CDV, CAV and CPV2) and that these will transfer to the puppies in colostrum. In such a circumstance it is unlikely that either a 4\u2010week\u2010old or 6\u2010week\u2010old puppy will respond to core vaccination, although the chances of this are improved if high\u2010titre combination CDV and CPV2 vaccines designed for use in young puppies are applied. However, in LATAM, it is perhaps more likely that the bitch will not have been well vaccinated and it is therefore correct to attempt to provide protection to puppies as early as possible. The most appropriate way to do this would be with a vaccine containing CDV and CPV and designed for use in young puppies as described above. Such a product might be administered from 4 weeks of age; however, MLV vaccines should NEVER be given any earlier than then as they may produce infection and malformation in neonatal animals. After 6 weeks of age, puppies may be vaccinated every 2 to 4 weeks (switching to a trivalent CDV, CAV and CPV2 vaccine at 8 weeks old). The most important dose of core vaccine is actually that given at 16 weeks of age or older, when all puppies should have lost maternally\u2010derived antibodies and be capable of responding to vaccine. This should be followed by a fourth core vaccination given between 26 and 52 weeks of age (ideally at the earlier end of that range).\n22.

The use of \u201cartificial colostrum\u201d formulated of milk replacer and serum or plasma from a well\u2010vaccinated adult animal might also be considered in the first 24 hours of life. It is known experimentally that colostrum\u2010deprived animals are capable of making an immune response to core vaccine very early in life (Chappuis 1998) [EB1]; however, MLV vaccines should never be used any earlier than 4 weeks of age as they may induce infection or developmental defects in the neonatal animal. Core vaccination in this situation might start at 4 weeks of age. Although in theory, a colostrum\u2010deprived animal should be capable of responding to a single canine core vaccine or a single dose of FPV vaccine (because there is no inhibition from MDA), it would be pragmatic to proceed through the recommended WSAVA protocol for puppies or kittens. Even in a colostrum\u2010deprived kitten, at least two doses of FHV1 and FCV vaccine would be recommended.

Initial vaccination would ideally be given whilst the puppies were still with the bitch and arranged by the breeder. In Europe, for example, where puppies cannot be sold until after 8 weeks of age and where bitches are likely to be well vaccinated, a breeder might arrange for core vaccination at 8 to 9 weeks of age and then responsibility for subsequent vaccines passes to the new owner. In LATAM, where a puppy might be obtained much earlier in life, core vaccination might begin as early as 4 to 6 weeks of age (see recommendations above). According to WSAVA guidelines, puppies may receive core vaccines every 2 to 4 weeks, with the final early\u2010life dose of vaccine being given at 16 weeks of age or older. So the actual number of core vaccines will depend on the age of starting and the frequency of administration. A \u201cstandard\u201d protocol in North America or Europe might involve core vaccination at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age with a fourth core vaccine at 26 weeks of age.

It is simply not practical (and has welfare implications) to repeatedly blood sample very young puppies and, more importantly, until 16 weeks of age, it is not possible to discriminate between MDA and antibody produced endogenously by the puppy's own immune system in response to vaccination. So, the answer to the question is \u201cno\u201d it is not possible to use these test kits to determine the optimum time for puppy vaccination. However, the test kits could be used to determine the need for a core vaccine given between 26 and 52 weeks of age (according to WSAVA guidelines). If a puppy is tested at 20 weeks of age (i.e. 4 weeks after receiving the last core vaccine at 16 weeks of age or older) and is seropositive (for CDV, CAV and CPV2), then those antibodies must reflect the puppy's own immune response and indicate that immunological protection has been induced.

However, the level of MDA may vary between different bitches, depending on how well they have been vaccinated. Concentrations of MDA might also vary for the three major vaccinal antigens (CDV, CAV and CPV2) for any one bitch. There are, however, some breeds of dog (e.g. rottweilers, dobermanns) that may more likely include genetic \u201clow responders\u201d or \u201cnon\u2010responders\u201d to individual vaccine antigens (Day et al. 2016).

Rottweilers also make lesser serological responses to rabies vaccine (Kennedy et al. 2007) [EB1].

There is a wealth of serological data that shows that annual core revaccination of adult dogs is unnecessary and that protective antibody titres are maintained perfectly adequately with triennial (or longer) core revaccination (Abdelmagid et al. 2004, Bohm et al. 2004, Mouzin et al. 2004, Gore et al. 2005, Schultz 2006, Larson & Schultz 2007, Mitchell et al. 2012, Killey et al. 2018) [EB1].

There is therefore a theoretical risk that engaging puppies in socialisation activity (e.g. attending a puppy class, exposing a puppy to the outdoors) might allow them to acquire infectious disease. This is a dilemma for the veterinarian; however, we must encourage socialisation as behavioural issues are a major factor in the relinquishment of pet dogs later in life. There are certain practical measures that can be taken to minimise risk: (1) holding puppy classes in relatively clean environments, (2) ensuring that all puppy and adult participants are vaccinated and (3) ensuring the puppy receives the full WSAVA recommended course of core vaccination.

The mucocutaneous surfaces of the body are naturally interacting with very large numbers of antigens (e.g. from the microbiome, dietary antigen, inhaled antigen) in a continual process. Therefore, immunologically speaking, the delivery of multiple vaccine antigens on one occasion poses no problem to the immune system [EB4]. For multicomponent vaccines, a requirement of licensing is that it be demonstrated that each component is able to induce a protective immune response. Manufacturers also often demonstrate \u201ccompatibility\u201d of their own product ranges which are licensed to be co\u2010administered [EB2]. For these reasons, there is no immunological sense in staggering vaccine delivery over different weeks. This would necessitate multiple visits by the client and may increase the likelihood of crucial vaccinations being \u201cmissed\u201d from the schedule. One piece of practical advice is that where multiple different injections are to be given (e.g. core vaccine with a separate rabies vaccine), that these be given into different subcutaneous sites so that different draining lymph nodes are targeted for immune priming. Two studies from the USA counter this, in that they show for both dogs (particularly of low bodyweight) and cats that there is a greater likelihood of adverse reactions post vaccination when increasing numbers of antigens are delivered at any one time (Moore et al. 2005, 2007) [EB1].

If a dog has really recovered from a CDV infection, then it will have natural immunity to reinfection; probably better immunity than might be induced by a vaccine. Consequently, that dog could be tested and if seropositive would not require CDV revaccination. However, because the CDV antigen is generally mixed with other core vaccinal antigens, that dog will likely receive standard core revaccination in the future. If it is essential to revaccinate a dog recovered from CDV infection, then a period of 4 weeks post recovery should allow immune function to recover. The situation with Ehrlichia canis infection is more complex because the disease may have acute and chronic stages and treated dogs may still harbour the infectious agent such that disease can recur following any future stressful event. Again, if a dog has been diagnosed and appropriately treated, it should have been clinically normal for at least 4 weeks before any consideration of vaccination is made. In both circumstances, performing a simple haematological and serum biochemical examination might also indicate that an immunological recovery has been made (i.e. normalisation of leucocyte counts and serum gamma globulin concentration).\n35.

Although there are no formal studies of the effects of glucocorticotherapy on canine vaccination, there is a study of the effect of ciclosporin treatment on feline vaccinal immune responses. Whilst being treated with ciclosporin, cats were able to make adequate protective immune responses to previously seen vaccinal antigens (FPV, FHV1, FCV, FeLV and rabies), but the drug impaired the immune response to first\u2010time vaccination with FIV vaccine (Roberts et al. 2015) [EB1].\n39.

There are also studies that show that geriatric dogs (i.e. dogs over 10 years of age) maintain protective levels of antibody against these three core viral antigens and that these antibody levels do not decline with age as part of the phenomenon of \u201cimmunosenescence\u201d (HogenEsch et al. 2004) [EB1]. In contrast, it is also known that delivering a new vaccine (i.e. one not previously given) to an older dog leads to a less effective primary immune response than might have been made earlier in life (Day 2010) [EB1]. Therefore, there is no evidence that geriatric dogs require any more frequent core revaccination than younger adults; geriatric dogs can be safely maintained on the standard triennial core revaccination programme. Where core revaccination is determined by serological testing (titre testing), the VGG recommends that this might be performed annually (rather than triennially) in geriatric dogs; simply to provide reassurance that revaccination is not required [EB4].\n43.

The more dogs and cats that are vaccinated within the population, the more difficult it is for infectious disease to spread within that population. Veterinarians must understand that giving a core vaccine to an animal induces protective immunity. There are not degrees of protective immunity. The presence of antibody against core vaccine antigens, no matter what the titre, indicates that the animal has immunological protection and immunological memory and any exposure to the pathogen results in a rapid secondary (memory) immune response. It is simply not possible to make an individual animal MORE immune by giving more frequent vaccination. In fact, immunologically speaking and from first principles, repeated vaccination above the recommended levels is more likely to induce immunological \u201ctolerance\u201d (failure to respond) than immunological protection [EB4]. Therefore, triennial core revaccination according to WSAVA guidelines is perfectly adequate, even for the most high\u2010risk of dogs.

However, if a puppy or kitten is presented for vaccination, but clearly carries a massive parasite burden to the extent of being severely anaemic and clinically ill, then of course vaccination might best be delayed until the animal is healthy. However, most parasitized puppies and kittens remain apparently healthy. There is currently no evidence to suggest that carrying a \u201cnormal\u201d burden of parasites interferes with the ability of a puppy (or kitten) to respond to vaccination. In fact, it may be more important to provide protection against life\u2010threatening viral disease than to worry about any possible effect of parasitism on vaccination. However, immunologically speaking, there is now much research that shows that parasite infestation can influence the nature of immune responses by skewing immunity towards a T regulatory response associated with immunological suppression and a T helper 2 type response dominated by humoral rather than cell\u2010mediated immunity and this has also been shown for the dog (Junginger et al. 2017) [EB1]. There are experimental studies in mice and pigs that show that endoparasitism impairs vaccinal immune responses (Urban et al. 2007) [EB1], but what is currently lacking is any evidence that endoparasite infestation impairs canine or feline vaccinal immune responses. Deworming is clearly an important part of preventive health care for dogs and cats (and has public health implications), but there is currently no basis for delaying vaccination for susceptible animals until deworming has been completed.\n61.

This is one reason why the VGG has produced a companion document to the global veterinary guidelines, written in lay language for the pet owner and breeder (unfortunately only in English). This is a factual source of information to which clients concerned about vaccines might be directed. At the time of writing, the VGG is also conducting a global survey of vaccination hesitancy in small companion animal practice. The results of the survey will be presented during 2020.\n63. How common are adverse events post vaccination and what type of adverse events may we see in practice?\n",

            "text": "A wide range of adverse events has been recognised post vaccination. Most of these are transient and mild (e.g. type I hypersensitivity reactions immediately post vaccination), but some may induce more severe disease (e.g. immune\u2010mediated haemolytic anaemia, feline injection site sarcoma). The single most common \u201creaction\u201d is mild lethargy, anorexia and pyrexia for 2 to 3 days post vaccination. This is actually not an adverse reaction, but more an indication that the vaccine has stimulated immune and inflammatory pathways as part of generating the protective immune response. It is difficult to obtain accurate data on the frequency of adverse reactions post vaccination. Reviewing all of the global information, we can say that there are somewhere between 30 and 50 adverse reactions (mostly mild and transient) for every 10,000 vaccinations given in practice (Moore et al. 2005, 2007, Miyaji et al. 2012) [EB1]. The risk of contracting life\u2010threatening infectious disease (particularly in environments such as in LATAM) far outweighs the risk of adverse events.\n64. If an animal has had an allergic reaction post\u2010vaccination in the past, should you ever vaccinate them again?\n",

In reality, this does not always happen and sometimes such reactions occur only once. If the reaction has occurred in a puppy or kitten that has not yet received the full course of early life vaccines, then that animal must be revaccinated in order to receive the full schedule of core vaccines. You might consider whether non\u2010core vaccines are justified for that animal, and as an adult, serological testing might be used to inform the need for core vaccines. There are certain practical measures that might be taken to avoid the occurrence of such reactions for second or subsequent times. Switching brand of vaccine may or may not have an effect. There is no harm in giving a dose of antihistamine or anti\u2010inflammatory dose of glucocorticoid immediately before vaccination; this will not interfere with the efficacy of the vaccine. The animal may best be kept in the clinic and monitored for several hours post vaccination, rather than being sent home.\n65. If an animal has had an allergic reaction post\u2010vaccination in the past, can you use glucocorticoids before giving future vaccines in order to prevent such reactions occurring again?\n",

            "text": "Immune\u2010mediated or autoimmune diseases are complex multifactorial disorders involving triggering factors acting on a background of immune dysregulation in a genetically susceptible individual. Recognised trigger factors for canine immune\u2010mediated diseases include underlying infection, neoplasia, chronic inflammation or recent exposure to drugs or vaccines. The evidence for vaccine\u2010associated autoimmunity in the dog is limited and restricted to clinical observations of immune\u2010mediated disease beginning 2 to 4 weeks post vaccination in the absence of any other possible triggers. The most common disorder linked to vaccination is immune\u2010mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA) with conflicting evidence related to immune\u2010mediated thrombocytopenia (IMTP) or immune\u2010mediated polyarthritis. That said, because vaccination is a potential trigger, and because immune\u2010mediated diseases have a relapsing and remitting pattern, careful consideration should be given to revaccination protocols for any dog that has been successfully treated and recovered from an immune\u2010mediated disorder. Core revaccination might be avoided if the dog is serologically tested and shown to already have immunity. Non\u2010core vaccines should be carefully selected, weighing the balance between disease exposure risk and risk of relapse of immune\u2010mediated disease. It may not be possible (legally) to avoid rabies revaccination; however, in some US states it is possible for the veterinarian to authorise \u201cmedical exemption\u201d from rabies revaccination. Although these precautions are sensible (from first principles), two recent studies actually show no significant ill\u2010effect when dogs recovered from IMHA or IMTP were revaccinated (Ellis et al. 2016a, 2016b, Moon & Veir 2019) [EB1].\n67. What is the evidence that adjuvanted vaccines are a cause of the feline injection site sarcoma (FISS)?\n",

            "text": "Vaccines are just one of a long list of injectable products that have been associated with FISS. There is something unique about cat (versus dog) subcutis, which means that repeated injection (of anything) may establish a state of chronic inflammation that might at some point transform into neoplastic disease. The cat, in general, appears more susceptible to developing sarcomas following localised trauma or chronic inflammation (Morrison 2012) [EB1]. Whether adjuvant in vaccines makes vaccines any more likely to induce this reaction is a contentious debate. There is no doubt that adjuvant induces a long\u2010lasting localised chronic inflammatory reaction at the injection site (much more so than non\u2010adjuvanted vaccines) (Day et al. 2007) [EB1], but it is suggested that any vaccine is capable of inducing this reaction. In practical terms, the advice is to minimise the use of all vaccines in cats (i.e. by vaccinating according to WSAVA guidelines) and wherever possible to minimise the use of adjuvanted vaccine as a precaution. Consideration should also be given to the site of administration of vaccines to cats (see Question 68).\n68.

There are several different options recommended by different organisations and authors. These include administration as far distal as possible subcutaneously into the hindlimbs and forelimbs, administration into the skin of the lateral abdomen and administration as far distal as possible into the tail. The WSAVA does not recommend a single option, but suggests that at very least the scruff of the neck is not used and that vaccination sites may be rotated each time and that those sites be recorded in the animal's medical record.\n69.

Note that serology cannot predict protection against FHV1 or FCV, or against any non\u2010core vaccine antigens. Serological testing for the efficacy of rabies vaccination is often required for the purposes of pet travel, but in this instance, testing is generally performed within a defined period post vaccination (e.g. 4 weeks) and serological testing is not used in general practice to demonstrate protection from rabies because titres can decline after the recommended testing interval. You should select a well\u2010validated test kit supported by peer\u2010reviewed scientific literature. Serology might be performed annually or triennially during the annual health check consultation. Many owners, particularly those concerned about the safety of vaccines (see question 62) will prefer this option for their pets.\n70. Are there kits to evaluate antibody titres in cats?\n",
