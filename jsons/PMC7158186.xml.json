Early studies were primarily descriptive and based mostly on survey data collected following disasters. Surveys tended to rely on self-reported impacts and the time frames in which data were collected varied from immediately postdisaster to months after the event (Adams & Adams, 1984). These early studies were wide-ranging with regard to disaster type, including both acute (e.g., hurricanes, flash floods, and earthquakes) and more chronic types of emergencies (winter storms, droughts, and volcanic activity) (Adams and Adams, 1984, Erikson, 1976, Glass et al., 1979, Killian, 1954, Spencer et al., 1977).",

However, the circumstances, under which the methods were employed, were very different and varied depending on the phase of the disaster process that was being studied. For example, immediately after a disaster, it may be more difficult to develop hypotheses, design reliable studies, recruit appropriate controls, or locate subjects (Killian, 1956). Delays associated with obtaining Institutional Review Board approval of research protocols may hinder the immediate collection of data in the postdisaster period (National Institutes of Health, n.d.). Research, particularly by those from outside the affected area who did not experience the disaster firsthand, can place perceived or actual burdens on individual respondents, communities, or systems during disaster response and recovery (Korteweg et al., 2010, Laska and Peterson, 2011).\n",

However, the role of epidemiologists in responding to disasters has expanded dramatically in the last two decades. Rapid Needs Assessment (RNA) methods, adapted from the World Health Organization's Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) method of estimating immunization coverage, began to be implemented regularly after humanitarian emergencies, beginning with the famines in Somalia (Boss, Toole, & Yip, 1994), and after disasters, beginning with Hurricane Andrew (CDC, 1992, Hlady et al., 1994, Malilay et al., 1996). Emergency department surveillance systems were implemented to capture illness, injury, and mortality data to quantify the health impacts of disasters such as floods in Louisiana (Ogden, Gibbs-Scharf, Kohn, & Malilay, 2001) and Hurricane Floyd in North Carolina (CDC, 2000). Other types of epidemiologic investigations, such as retrospective and prospective cohort studies, began to be implemented to study the long-term effects of disasters such as the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (Savitz et al., 2008), the Indian Ocean Tsunami (Nishikiori et al., 2006), and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (Stewart et al., 2011). The systematic use of the term \u201cdisaster epidemiology\u201d since the 1990s has helped to establish the discipline as a formal subset of epidemiology and encourage its ongoing development (Malilay et al., 2014).",

Globally, the number of people at risk continues to grow along with the populations of megacities located in vulnerable coastal areas, as does the cost of disasters relative to real global GDP (Bouwer, Crompton, Faust, H\u00f6ppe, & Pielke, 2007). These trends will likely accelerate along with the destructive potential of natural disasters due to climate change and sea-level rise.

Since data on immunization coverage and the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases (e.g., tetanus, diphtheria, measles, whooping cough, and polio) were not available, cluster sampling methods were utilized to collect rapid data on vaccination coverage.

Systems that did exist focused on communicable diseases such as malaria, influenza, yellow fever, dengue, tuberculosis, and cholera; however, little microbiological laboratory capacity was available to support these surveillance programs (Raska, 1966). Even in low resource settings, the need for postdisaster epidemiologic surveillance was made clear after a major earthquake killed 23,000 and injured 77,000 in Guatemala in February, 1976. The Ministry of Health's surveillance network was severely affected by the destruction of health facilities and the loss of communication and transportation infrastructure (Spencer et al., 1977). The lack of public health surveillance data was having a major impact on decisions related to opening field hospitals, conducting vaccination campaigns, and controlling rumors of epidemics (Spencer et al., 1977). Even with limited capacity, a surveillance system was established to collect data on cases of selected diseases, the number of available hospital beds, the availability of medications, and potential outbreaks.",

For example, five years after a major flooding disaster associated with Hurricane Agnes (Fig. 1.1), factors such as property loss, financial difficulties, use of alcohol, and perceived distress during the recovery period were associated with continued high blood pressure, somatization, and anxiety among residents of an affected town in Pennsylvania (Logue, Hansen, and Hansen 1980).\n",

For example, multiple follow-up studies were conducted by the Bhopal Gas Disaster Research Center and the Indian Council for Medical Research following exposure to methyl isocyanate gas that leaked from a Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India, in 1984, to enable tracking of long-term mortality and morbidity (Dhara & Dhara, 2002).

At the same time, increased media attention to disaster relief efforts, as well as the growth of global communication networks put more pressure on disaster response agencies to identify potential public health issues sooner and rapidly implement interventions to mitigate the health consequences of disasters in affected communities. Even with advancing computing technologies, rapid assessments were still frequently conducted using nonprobability sampling methods. The level of resources required to conduct RNAs remained relatively high, typically requiring outside assistance from various experts to develop assessment instruments, conduct interviews, and analyze data. However, during the 1990s, advances\u2014led by WHO and CDC\u2014were made to demonstrate the use of modified cluster sampling to perform RNAs (Hlady et al., 1994, Malilay et al., 1996, Turner et al., 1996, World Health Organization, 1999).

Several reports published in the 1990s demonstrated the effective use of surveillance data in disaster management, when it is vital to fully understand the impact of a disaster on a population's health. For example, following the Rwandan genocide of 1994, mortality and morbidity surveillance systems were established to track the health impacts among Rwandan refugees settled in Zaire (Goma Epidemiology Group, 1995). Ongoing morbidity surveillance was used to observe patterns in disease, assess needs, and effectively implement interventions. For example, the system was used to track cases of diarrheal disease, such as cholera and dysentery, which tended to be highly prevalent among these large refugee populations and could be easily transmissible in small areas. After the 1991\u201392 famine in Somalia, reviews of data from multiple assessments led researchers to call for the establishment of a surveillance system to track mortality, morbidity, and nutritional status so that data could be used to develop interventions programs and policies (Boss et al., 1994). The standardization of surveillance systems and the sharing of the data collected made it possible for other response groups to utilize similar approaches in other disaster settings.",

Other researchers modified the cluster sampling approach to conduct national surveys to measure multiple objectives (Turner et al., 1996). In addition, cross-sectional or prevalence studies were also beginning to be used in disaster epidemiology investigations due to their relative efficiency and cost-effectiveness. For example, Chen et al., (2015) conducted face-to-face interviews with victims of the 1998 Hunan, China floods who had been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to better understand risk factors for chronic PTSD.

Since an outside team traveling to reach a disaster-effected area to conduct an RNA can sometimes take more than a week and developing protocols to support the implementation of the assessment can take additional time, disaster-effected and displaced populations may be waiting too long to gain maximum benefit from the assessment findings. For example, during the first several weeks after a disaster, the risk factors and conditions that support the transmission of communicable diseases may begin to increase (Asari, Koido, Nakamura, Yamamoto, & Ohta, 2000). One way of shortening the length of time it takes to begin an assessment is to use geographical informational system (GIS) tools to speed up the processes of sample selection (Waring, Reynolds, D'Souza, & Arafat, 2002). Handheld devices such as tablets, smart phones, and global positioning system devices can be used to collect data electronically, reducing the time needed for data collection (CDC, 2004). Electronic data collection also eliminates double data entry, which can be an important consideration when dealing with the time constraints inherent in conducting assessments during public health emergencies (Horney, Ramsey, Smith, Johnson, & MacDonald, 2011).",

These new regulations established a list of conditions for which a single case would constitute a public health emergency, including emerging and reemerging diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and new influenza subtypes. In addition, new biosurveillance systems were implemented that integrated electronic medical records and syndromic surveillance from emergency rooms and emergency medical services in new ways that would be useful when monitoring mortality and morbidity resulting from natural disasters (Chughtai, DeVore, Kan, & Streichert, 2016). Syndromic surveillance systems were also adapted and expanded to monitor public health during large events, such as the 2012 London Olympics (Todkill et al., 2016) and the annual Hajj in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Al-Tawfiq, Gautret, Benkouiten, & Memish, 2016).",

Since 1980, hurricanes and tropical storms causing more than $1 billion in damages have increased from an average of 0.4 per year to more than 1 per year (National Research Council, 2014). The frequency and severity of complex humanitarian emergencies, defined as acute situations in which mortality substantially increases above the population baseline, either directly because of violence, or indirectly due to malnutrition or the transmission of communicable diseases, has also increased since the 1980s and 1990s (Salama, 2004). New areas for epidemiology investigations and studies postdisaster have also emerged, including reproductive (Horney et al., 2012, Zotti et al., 2013) and mental health (Galea et al., 2005, Neria et al., 2009). Changes in threats\u2014pandemic influenza, suicide bombers\u2014and in health systems and policies\u2014emergency department overcrowding, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\u2014mean that the body of knowledge related to disaster epidemiology can quickly become outdated, requiring the design and implementation of new studies in response to future disasters to continue to build the knowledge base of disaster epidemiology (Noji, 2005).",
