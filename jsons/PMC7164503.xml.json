            "text": "The measurement of respiratory impedance by oscillometry presents the opportunity to link structure to function in terms of simple inverse models of the respiratory system [1,2]. Such models typically consist of a very small number of compartments characterized by only a few free parameters. Once the parameters of an inverse model are evaluated by fitting the model to measurements of respiratory system impedance, they are taken to represent quantities of physiologic interest such as the flow resistance of the airways and the viscoelastic properties of the tissues. However, the extremely coarse-grained view of the lung afforded by simple inverse models contrasts starkly with the complexities of a real lung, and even with the tens of thousands of individually resolved voxels obtainable by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging [3,4]. The reason why simple models often accurately account for data arising from highly complicated structures such as a lung is that the contributions of the myriad components of the complicated structure can compensate for each other. This makes the system appear much simpler than it actually is, particularly if the operating ranges of frequency and amplitude are limited. This makes it challenging to understand what the compartments of an inverse model actually represent, especially in the presence of the regional mechanical heterogeneities that are typically present in lung disease.",

            "text": "Inverse models have been applied widely in lung mechanics for decades [1]. We focus here on a particular example that has arisen due to the burgeoning obesity epidemic, where an inverse model consisting of two elastic compartments connected in series and served by two airway conduits has been fit to measurements of respiratory impedance in obese subjects [5,6]. Increases in the resistance of the distal conduit of the model with increasing body mass index have been linked to peripheral airway compression by mass loading of the chest wall. Nevertheless, how the two compartments and conduits of this simple inverse model map onto the vastly more complicated structure of an actual lung remains unclear. Gaining insight into this issue is crucial for understanding what impedance measurements tell us about the impact of obesity on lung function. To gain this insight, we developed an anatomically based computational model that allows respiratory system impedance to be simulated under precisely controlled and known conditions. We then fit the two-compartment inverse model to the simulated data in order to determine how various physiological phenomena affect the parameters of the inverse model. In particular, we investigated how the distensibility of the pulmonary airway tree and the shunt compliance of the cheeks and upper airways affect the shape of the respiratory impedance spectrum between 5 and 20 Hz, and how this affects the interpretation of the parameters of the series two-compartment inverse model.",

A terminal airway that connects to an acinus is assigned order 1. Order number increases as one moves proximally, so the branch with the highest order number, N, is the trachea. We are concerned here with those conducting airway branches that contribute to the overall resistance of the airways. The very peripheral bronchioles are small and thus individually have high resistances. At the same time, however, they are so numerous that their combined cross section is very large, leading them to comprise what has been called the \u201csilent zone\u201d of the lung [9], although one could imagine that the boundary of this zone moves distally as airways become more constricted or eliminated in disease. Exactly how many airway orders are needed to account for the mechanical impedance of the lung is thus somewhat unclear. Following Horsfield and Cumming [10], we will set N=25.",

What the Horsfield scheme conveniently allows, however, is the imposition of a regular asymmetry to the structure of the airway tree by having each parent airway of order k give rise to daughters having different orders. One of these daughter airways is necessarily of order k\u22121, but the other has order k\u22121\u2212\u0394, where \u0394\u22651 is an integer that sets the degree of asymmetry (except when the order of the parent is <\u0394 in which case both daughters are of order 1). Figure 1 illustrates this branching scheme for \u0394=2. In general, the value of \u0394 is a function of the order of the parent airway, but here we will assume it to have a single value throughout the entire airway tree. Indeed, Horsfield and Cumming [10] found that the number of airways of order n in the human lung is closely approximated by 1.38N\u2212n, which corresponds almost exactly to \u0394=3. This permits the branching structure of the airway tree to be described by the two parameters, N and \u0394, which we will take as having fixed values for the human lung (Table 1).",

Weibel [11] found that the diameter of an airway is proportional to bn where the value of b varies between 1.175 and 1.062 depending on n. If we assume that, to a first approximation, b can be assigned its average value of 1.133 for all airways in the tree, then the ratio of the diameter of an airway of order k to that of an airway of order k+1 is \u03b3=(1/b)=0.88. This value of \u03b3 is not immutable, however. In the bronchoconstricted state, for example, airways of different orders may narrow to different degrees. Also, the airway dimensions measured in the Horsfield study [10] came from a single resin cast of a human lung, so the diameter ratios could have been significantly affected by the procedures used in preparing the lung for analysis. \u03b3 is thus a free parameter of the model (Table 2).",

This corresponds to a length range of 2.90<l<11.38 mm. If we replace this relationship with l=3.04d, then the predicted values of l are affected over the above range by <0.78 mm. This allows l to be expressed as a function of radius (r) as l=\u03bbr, where \u03bb=2\u00d73.04=6.08, which is similar to airway length-to-radius estimates made by Tawhai et al.

The resistances derived from these free parameters are expressed in units of g s\u22121 cm\u22124 (Eqs. (4) and (5)). However, the conventional unit of pressure in respiratory mechanics is the centimeter of water (cmH2O), which is the pressure exerted over an area of 1 cm2 by a water column 1 cm in height. This column has a volume of 1 ml, a mass of 1 g, and therefore a weight of 1 g experiencing the acceleration due to gravity (roughly 1000 cm s\u22122). A pressure of 1 cmH2O is thus equivalent to a force of 1000 g cm s\u22122 acting over an area of 1 cm\u22122, or 1000 g s\u22122 cm\u22121. To convert a value of resistance in units of g s\u22121 cm\u22124 to one expressed in conventional units, the value is divided by 1000 to give units of (g s\u22122 cm\u22121) (s2 cm1) s\u22121 cm\u22124 = cmH2O s ml\u22121. A similar argument applies when converting inertance from units of g cm\u22122, as in Eq. (11), to cmH2O s2 ml\u22121. Finally, in this study, we express resistance and inertance in the units conventional for an adult human, which are cmH2O s L\u22121 and cmH2O s2 L\u22121, respectively. This requires that both quantities be multiplied by 1000. The numerical values thus remain unchanged from their initial calculations. The values of Ea and Eb (Eqs. (6)\u2013(9)) are already expressed in units of cmH2O ml\u22121, so converting them to units of cmH2O L\u22121 merely requires that they be multiplied by 1000.",

Using an anatomically reasonable value for RN of 0.75 cm, we found that \u03b3=0.86 gave a value for overall resistance of the airway tree resistance (Raw) of 0.62 cmH2O s L\u22121, which is similar to values found experimentally [20]. We used a value for Hrs of 30 cmH2O L\u22121 as representative of a normal adult lung. When the airways are completely rigid, and with the shunt effect of the upper airways excluded, the real part of Z shows a slight dependence on f resulting from the frequency dependence of the tissue impedance inherent in its constant-phase formulation (Eqs. (13) and (14)) and from the regional ventilation heterogeneity resulting from the asymmetrical airway branching pattern inherent in \u0394=3. The imaginary part of Z increases monotonically with f, achieving a resonant frequency around 7 Hz, which is similar to that typically observed in normal adults [2]. When the finite elastance of the airways due to the compressibility of the gas they contain (Ea in Eqs. (6) and (7)) is included in the calculation, the effects on both real and imaginary parts of Z are imperceptible (Fig. 5(a)). To include the effects of intrinsic wall tissue stiffness (Eb in Eqs. (8) and (9)), we chose a value for Etis of 30 cmH2O since this produced an overall airway tree elastance due to tissue distension of 550 cmH2O L\u22121 which is close to the value used by Mead [14]. This has a more noticeable effect on impedance, particularly resistance, as does the inclusion of upper airway shunting (Fig. 5(a)). None of the effects of airway elastance on the impedance of the normal respiratory system could be described as dramatic, however.",

This represents a moderate level of bronchoconstriction that is uniform throughout the airway tree (all airways narrow by the same fractional amount). The relative effects of airway elastance and upper airway shunting are similar to those under conditions shown in Fig. 5(a). This contrasts with the consequences of preferentially narrowing the more distal airways by keeping rN fixed at its baseline value of 0.75 cm while reducing \u03b3 from 0.86 to 0.84, thereby making the airways narrow more rapidly with decreasing order number for an increase in Raw of about fivefold to a value of 2.33 cmH2O s L\u22121. The addition of airway elastance and upper airway shunting has little consequence for resistance but causes a major effect on resonant frequency (Fig. 5(c)). Finally, Fig. 5(d) shows what happens when obstruction is replaced by restriction achieved by increasing Hrs from 30 to 100 cmH2O L\u22121, corresponding to a loss of roughly 2/3 of the parenchymal tissues.

Also shown in Fig. 6(a) is the excellent fit provided by the two-compartment inverse model (Eqs.

The value of Raw in the simulation model was 10.11 cmH2O s L\u22121, while the total airway elastance was 762 cmH2O L\u22121.

This addresses the extent to which the parameters of the inverse model correspond to components of the anatomically based simulation model. In the case of peripheral airway resistance, this correspondence is extremely good; Rp estimates the overall resistance of the airway tree in the forward model closely (Fig. 7(a)). The correspondence is less clear for the elastance of the peripheral compartment (Ep), which is about 50% higher than the total tissue elastance in the forward model over most of the \u03b3 range investigated (Fig. 7(b)). The elastance of the central compartment (Ec), in contrast, is considerably lower than that of the upper airway shunt compartment in the forward model, with the exception of \u03b3=0.85 (Fig. 7(c)). These results indicate that the two-compartment inverse model captures the global compartmentalization of the respiratory system by parsing it into a proximal shunt compartment and a distal respiratory system compartment. Nevertheless, the two compartments of the inverse model cannot be taken as accurate representations of either the upper airways or the respiratory system itself even though the parameter Rp appears to accurately reflect the overall resistance of the pulmonary airway tree.",

Such models, however, require the specification of a very large number of independent parameters, which can be challenging. Also, while simulation of impedance using a patient-specific model has obvious potential for aiding in the design of treatment strategies for a given patient, the results lack generality. In this study, we sought to use an anatomically based model with a minimum number of free parameters in order to obtain insights that are as general as possible. Fortunately, a high degree of parsimony is possible in the modeling of respiratory impedance because the airway tree is a fairly regular multiscale structure that can be represented in an average sense as a fractal [10,23], meaning it can be modeled reasonably accurately using only a very few scaling parameters.",

            "text": "Simple inverse models of the lung have also found wide application in the study of lung mechanics and have been applied to respiratory impedance data over a number of different frequency ranges [1]. We focus here on the intermediate frequency range of 5\u201320 Hz since this has received a great deal of clinical interest. Indeed, resistances at 5 and 20 Hz and the area under the reactance curve below the resonant frequency are commonly used empirical markers of lung function [24,25]. Understanding what these quantities reflect anatomically is therefore very useful for linking structure to function. The results of the present computational modeling study indicate that the finite elasticity of the airway tree and the shunt elastance of the upper airways can significantly affect respiratory system impedance between 5 and 20 Hz when the airways become constricted (Fig. 5), particularly in the case of upper airway shunt. Severe peripheral airway constriction leads to the type of negative dependence of resistance on frequency (Fig. 6(a)) that has been described in obese subjects, although at the same time this condition pushes the resonant frequency to values higher than observed by Al-Alwan et al. [5]. The two-compartment inverse model shown in Fig. 4 describes Z under these conditions very accurately (Fig. 6(a)), returning parameter values reminiscent of those found in obese subjects [5]. On the other hand, when the airways constrict by the same fractional degree throughout the airway tree the two-compartment inverse model does not describe Z well (Fig. 6(b)). This shows that the compartmentalization of the respiratory system, at least to the extent that it behaves like two elastic compartments connected in series, depends to a substantial degree on the pattern of airway narrowing. Of course, the lungs can also become compartmentalized in a parallel fashion as first examined by Otis et al. [26], and indeed regional ventilation defects are well known to occur in asthma [27]. It is likely, however, that the time constants involved in such defects are quite long relative to those of normal lung emptying, which would suggest that a parallel two-compartment model of the lung would be more appropriate for a range of frequencies much lower than those we consider here.",

With predominately peripheral airway constriction, the parameter Rp appears to provide an accurate reflection of Raw in the simulation model (Fig. 7(a)), yet when fractional narrowing is uniform throughout the airway tree Rp is less than half of Raw. This implies that it is effectively impossible to reliably attribute the parameters of the inverse model to central versus peripheral airways as is commonly supposed [25], and that the apparent two-compartment nature of Z between 5 and 20 Hz in spontaneously breathing humans is due to the interaction of upper airway shunting and the overall impedance of the respiratory system.",

Indeed, eliminating upper airway compliance has been a goal for decades, with the most ingenious approach probably being the so-called head generator of Peslin et al. [28]. This approach is too cumbersome for routine use, however, leaving little choice but to use conventional cheek support with the hands. On the other hand, our findings underscore the need to support the cheeks as firmly as possible. They also demonstrate why oscillometry is so naturally suited to the study of intubated patients receiving mechanical ventilation and to the study of tracheostomized animal models [2], since in both cases the upper airways are bypassed altogether, allowing an unfettered mechanical view into the lungs from the tracheal opening.",

This model arguably accounts for the key global features of pulmonary anatomy that include an asymmetrically branching airway tree comprised of successively smaller branches that terminate in parenchyma having a complex mechanical impedance. Nevertheless, the model ignores structural subtleties that are unique to individual lungs, and it assumes a level of scale-free symmetry that is an oversimplification of real airway tree structure. Also, in this study, we simulated bronchoconstriction either by narrowing all airways by the same proportional amount (Figs. 5(b) and 6(a)) or by altering a single scaling parameter so that airways narrow proportionately more according to how peripheral they are (Figs. 5(c) and 6(b)). In reality, narrowing is likely to be heterogeneous throughout the airway tree [4,21,27]. Indeed, such regional heterogeneity may be responsible for some of the negative frequency dependence of resistance observed in obese subjects [5]. The difficulty with trying to explain impedance in these terms, however, is that there is an essentially limitless number of possible heterogeneous configurations of the airway tree that could potentially explain a given impedance spectrum, even when guided by high-resolution three-dimensional imaging [4,12,21,22]. This is why we opted in this study to try to reproduce the essential features of impedance with a scale-free model characterized by as few free parameters as possible. Even so, assigning physiologically reasonable values to these parameters remains a challenge given that much of the structural information needed for the model was derived from fixed post-mortem lungs [10] that may differ in important ways from lungs in vivo.",

            "text": "Another model limitation lies in our choice for the value of the parameter Etis, which was derived indirectly from considerations of anatomic dead space [14], itself an estimated parameter. An alternative approach for estimating Etis is to consider how Raw depends on transpulmonary pressure. For example, Brown et al. [20] obtained a slope of 0.71 L s\u22121 cmH2O\u22122 for the relationship between respiratory system conductance and transpulmonary pressure in healthy adult subjects when conductance itself was around 1 L s\u22121 cmH2O\u22121. Assume this corresponds roughly to a slope of Raw versus transpulmonary pressure of about 1 s L\u22121 when Raw = 1 cmH2O s L\u22121 at a pressure of 1 cmH2O. Further assume that changes in Raw occur solely through changes in airway radius. A doubling of transpulmonary pressure from 1 to 2 cmH2O is predicted to increase radius by the fourth root of 2 (via Eq. (4)), or a factor of roughly 1.2, corresponding to a fractional change in airway volume of about 1.4. If the total volume of the airway tree is 100 ml, this means that the airways expand by 40 ml with a 1 cmH2O increase in transmural pressure, giving an airway tree elastance of 1/0.04 = 24 cmH2O L\u22121. This is an order of magnitude lower than the value of 500 cmH2O L\u22121 we used in this present study, meaning that Etis would be correspondingly reduced. While this would produce much greater effects on impedance that those shown in Fig. 5, it is probably unrealistic because changing lung volume slowly over the vital capacity range, as in Ref. [20], would likely alter airway smooth muscle tone and thus produce significantly greater changes in airway caliber than would be caused by small-amplitude forced oscillations in flow. Nevertheless, the matter remains unresolved so our present results, while perhaps instructive, cannot be taken as definitive.",

Adjusting these parameters in various ways allows us to investigate how both obstructive and restrictive lung diseases affect impedance. This provides a tool to assist in the interpretation of impedance measurements made using oscillometry in humans. We focused in this study on how the finite elastances of the airway tree and the upper airways affect impedance between 5 and 20 Hz and conclude that progressive airway constriction causes impedance to appear to arise from two compartments connected in series. The proximal compartment is essentially a reflection of upper airway elastance, while the lower compartment reflects the pulmonary airways and tissues. Even so, this does not allow the properties of central versus peripheral airways to be resolved in measurements of respiratory system impedance made between 5 and 20 Hz.",
