Patient and graft outcomes are closely monitored on a national level and 1-year survival is between 80 and 92 % ( http://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/latest-Data/rptStrat.asp accessed 10/19/13). Perhaps more than with any other surgical program, graft and patient outcomes for liver transplantation refl ect the combined efforts of several interrelated services. The success stems from a multidisciplinary approach with close involvement of gastroenterologists, anesthesiologists, surgeons, and intensivists. This chapter will review the concerns related to postoperative care of the liver transplant patient in the intensive care unit. Existing evidence on potential early concerns such as hemodynamic monitoring, respiratory failure, neurologic management, electrolyte and glucose correction, coagulation management, systemic immunosuppression, graft function and rejection, and technical problems will be reviewed. The chapter will conclude with brief mention of long-term complications related to recurrence of disease that may lead to future ICU admissions.",

Acute changes in hemodynamics that are not properly diagnosed or treated can result in impaired graft function, prolonged ICU stay, and increased mortality. Postoperative management of hemodynamics begins with a thorough understanding of the underlying pathophysiology. End-stage liver disease typically results in high cardiac output and low systemic vascular resistance. Following successful transplantation this process begins to reverse, leading to a reduction in cardiac output and an increase in systemic vascular resistance with improved maintenance of systolic blood pressure [ 1 ] .",

The type of monitoring differs among transplant centers and is determined by individual or institutional practice. For example, Schumann et al. surveyed 62 transplant centers in the United States and found that PACs were used in 30 % and transesophageal echocardiography was used in 11.3 % during the intra-operative period [ 3 ] .",

            "text": "Due to limitations of central venous and pulmonary artery catheters, the use of dynamic methods of fl uid responsiveness is currently being explored. Presumably dynamic measurements based on physiologic responses will be more accurate than static indicators [ 7 ] . The measurements, including systolic pressure variations (SPV) and pulse pressure variations (PPV) , are derived from algorithms that abstract data from an arterial line and allow beat-to-beat monitoring for the purpose of predicting fl uid responsiveness. Although the data are promising under anesthesia [ 8 , 9 ] , these monitors have not been validated in the ICU. Furthermore, in order to obtain accurate calculations, patients must be in sinus rhythm, have a closed chest, have normal intra-abdominal pressures, and be on controlled ventilation with positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0-5 cm H 2 O [ 10 ] . Perhaps the most prudent approach from all this data is to base management on clinical examination fi ndings and appropriately titrate fl uid according to the patient's hemodynamic trends. The preferred choice of monitoring tool (central venous line, PAC, or echocardiography) remains controversial due to the lack of evidence indicating a difference in patient outcomes. Overall choice of monitoring for cardiac function and fl uid status is probably best decided based on the expertise of the center and the familiarity and ease of access to different options.",

Prevalence of portopulmonary syndrome in liver transplant is approximately 6 % as found in a prospective study evaluating 165 patients [ 12 ] . Due to the effect on postoperative mortality, most patients with portopulmonary hypertension will have been identifi ed in the preoperative setting; this information is vital to the physician caring for the patient postoperatively. Of particular importance are both the severity of disease and treatments the patient received prior to transplant. Disease severity is a predictor of postoperative mortality. Severe portopulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure > 45 mmHg) is associated with a perioperative mortality of 40 % [ 13 ] . Mild pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure < 35 mmHg) is not associated with decreased survival and current case series suggest that if pulmonary pressures can be reduced medically to less than 35 mmHg, then outcomes are acceptable [ 14 ] .",

Concern exists for the use of high-dose corticosteroids accelerating rates of HCV recurrence, HCC recurrence, and hepatic fi brosis. However, the avoidance of steroids in immunosuppression has not been shown to be benefi cial in HCV positive transplant recipients [ 95 ] . Commonly seen acute side effects from high-dose steroids include: hypertension, glucose intolerance, agitation/insomnia, infection risk, and poor wound healing. Most of the signs and symptoms can be managed, so corticosteroid cessation is rare. The calcineurin inhibtors (CNIs) , cyclosporine and tacrolimus, are used frequently in order to prevent rejection. Calcineurin inhibition results in a decrease in the proinfl ammatory cytokine IL-2 and subsequent decrease in T-cell activation. Both CNIs undergo metabolism by the cytochrome P450 system, and require careful monitoring of levels, especially when used in conjunction with other medications that induce or inhibit cytochrome P450 [ 93 ] . Common side effects of CNIs include nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity, including seizures, delirium, cognitive impairment, neuropathy, and coma. If a posttransplant patient develops concerning neurologic symptoms, tacrolimus levels should be checked. Unfortunately, neurologic symptoms can develop even at therapeutic levels of tacrolimus. Treatment is largely supportive as there is no way to acutely lower tacrolimus levels other than dose adjustment. A strategy of using low dose CNI for maintenance of immunosuppression has been suggested in order to minimize renal dysfunction [ 96 , 97 ] . Additional side effects from CNIs include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, metabolic acidosis, and diabetes. CNIs have also been found to increase levels of the transcription factor TGF-beta, which may increase the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence or posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder [ 93 , 94 ] .",

Since chronic rejection is not usually an issue for the ICU patient, it will not be covered in this chapter. Hyperacute rejection, mediated by antibodies, occurs within minutes to hours after the transplant procedure. Sixty percent of the cases of hyperacute rejection are due to ABOincompatible allografts. In the presence of ABO-incompatible transplants, plasmapheresis, splenectomy, and the CD20 monoclonal antibody, rituximab, have been reported to prevent hyperacute rejection [ 104 ] , but immediate retransplantation is often the only lasting option. Because antibodymediated rejection with ABO-compatible allografts is so rare, due to the liver's relative resistance to the humoral immune system, a positive crossmatch does not necessarily preclude liver transplantation. However, evidence does suggest that the presence of preformed donor-specifi c HLAantibodies can increase the risk of acute cellular rejection and chronic rejection [ 26 ] .",

Acute rejection is characterized by mononuclear infl ammation and active cell damage, and episodes refractory to antirejection medications (usually high-dose steroids) can progress to chronic rejection [ 105 ] . Risk factors for the development of steroid unresponsive acute rejection include pre-liver transplant steroid administration, ABO incompatibility, recurrent rejection, low serum cyclosporine levels, and high liver function tests. A rising or persistent elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels should prompt a biopsy to exclude rejection.

GVHD is divided between acute (occurring within 100 days of transplant) and chronic (after 100 days) presentations. Risk factors associated with the development of GVHD include alcoholic liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and diabetes mellitus. It has also been suggested that GVHD is more likely to occur in the setting of close HLA matching and autoimmune hepatitis. Symptoms usually develop 2-6 weeks posttransplant, and include fever, diarrhea, rash, and pancytopenia. Similar to treatment for acute rejection, treatment of GVHD includes administration of corticosteroids, increasing the current immunosuppressant regimen, or administration of medications for the antagonism of T cells. Mortality following the development of GVHD can be as high as 85 % [ 107 ] .

This trend has occurred due to the UNOS organ allocation protocol, which allows exception to the MELD score for patients with HCC, giving them priority for liver transplantation beyond that determined by the degree of liver dysfunction [ 144 , 145 ] . The rates of recurrence for patients with limited disease (with the Milan Criteria) are 10 %, while patients with more aggressive disease demonstrate recurrence rates of 40-60 % [ 146 ] . The risk of tumor recurrence in these patients is augmented by the use of immunosuppressants, and early discontinuation of calcineurin inhibitors may help to prevent disease recurrence. Uncontrolled pilot trials and retrospective analyses have suggested that sirolimus was associated with lower tumor recurrence and improved survival after liver transplantation [ 147 ] . These results have not been confi rmed in an RCT and no recommendation can be made regarding use of mTOR inhibitors to reduce HCC recurrence outside of clinical trials.",

While most disease recurs within the fi rst 1-2 years following transplant, late disease recurrence is not uncommon [ 149 ] . Surveillance methods following transplant should include serial chest and abdominal imaging for 3 years following transplant. AFP levels may be trended as well.

Risk factors for the development of PTLD include Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, young recipient age, cytomegalovirus (CMV) mismatch, and the use of thymoglobulin [ 151 ] . Early occurrence frequently occurs in the setting of EBV infection, while later occurrence is not associated with EBV. EBV status should be determined prior to transplantation in order to identify high-risk individuals. Patients with high viral loads should be considered for early preemptive therapy, including the use of antivirals or monoclonal B cell antibodies. The signs of PTLD development include lymphadenopathy, microcytic anemia, electrolyte disturbances, and abnormal liver or kidney function. The diagnosis relies on histopathology. Once PTLD has been diagnosed, a reduction or cessation of immunosuppression should be considered [ 151 ] . The anti CD20 antibody rituximab, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgical debulking are effective in the treatment of PTLD [ 152 , 153 ] . Though not often seen in the ICU, some of these patients may be admitted due to complications from tumor growth or chemotherapy.",
