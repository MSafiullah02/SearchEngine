Although most children with bronchiolitis have mild disease and are managed at home, infants admitted to hospital for the condition almost always have severe symptoms.1, 2 The clinical relevance of the identification of the specific pathogens or combination of pathogens infecting a child remains unclear. However, children with human rhinovirus (hRV) may have different short\u2010 and long\u2010term outcomes3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 compared to children with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). We showed that clinical severity was not correlated with the level of serum Krebs von den Lungen 6 antigen (KL\u20106), a biomarker of epithelial dysfunction, in previously healthy children,9 which indicates that the various clinical outcomes depend more on the adaptive capacities of the host rather than the intensity of epithelial dysfunction. Prediction of the risk of recurrent wheezing or long\u2010term asthma from the first year of life can be challenging.10 Against this background, we decided to prospectively follow a cohort of infants with an early episode of acute bronchiolitis, either hospitalized or cared for at home. Our main objective was to assess the risk factors for developing symptoms of recurrent bronchial obstruction during a 3\u2010year follow\u2010up after an episode of bronchiolitis in the first year of life. The secondary objective was to identify in this cohort the risk factors associated with allergic sensitization at the age of 3.",

Since now, the role of RSV\u2010hRV co\u2010infection in bronchiolitis severity is not so clear, may be due to discrepancies in the detection of hRV. For instance, in a study from Miller et al18 most HRV\u2010C co\u2010detections are with RSV. But finally in a larger study HRVs were statistically the least likely virus of 17 examined to be associated with co\u2010infections.19 However, Costa et al20 showed that severe disease in hRV infections were caused mainly by presence of RSV in co\u2010infections, in accordance with other results from Yoshida et al.21 These results could suggest indirect evidence of a higher risk of subsequent asthma in infants RSV\u2010hRV coinfected, as children with severe bronchiolitis during infancy have an increased early childhood asthma morbidity.22 Our results, including outpatients and hospitalized children with both documented viral infections, may bring new insights about the role of RSV\u2010hRV coinfection regardless of initial severity of bronchiolitis.",

This cohort study provides further evidence that living in a farming environment during childhood protects against asthma in adolescence and adulthood and provides further support for the hygiene hypothesis.33, 34 However, we need to analyze our results on the environment carefully, as we analyzed respiratory outcome only after 3 years and throughout childhood or adulthood.",

It is difficult to compare our results regarding allergic sensitization with those of other published works. For Nuolirvita et al,35 current atopy is considered if the child has either allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis. Other authors base the diagnosis of atopy on skin prick tests with or without association with physician diagnosis of allergy.36, 37) A co\u2010infection of RSV and rhinovirus associated with an atopic predisposition promotes awareness of sensitization to aeroallergens. This finding is in agreement with a study suggesting that hRV plays a major role in triggering allergy. Two immunologic factors, low interferon responses and indicators of atopy (eosinophilia, allergen\u2010specific IgEs), are closely associated with susceptibility to hRV\u2010bronchiolitis.38 Perez et al39 have discussed the evidence for the presence of abnormal innate antiviral immunity, exaggerated production of the master Th2 molecule thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), and altered antimicrobial host defense in the airways of asthmatic individuals with acute hRV infection. It is possible that the epithelial damage induced by the RSV promotes replication of the hRV by allowing access to the deep receptors of this virus.5\n",

Familial atopy and environmental factors play an important role in the incidence of recurrent episodes. Allergic sensitization is a certain risk factor for asthma in the longer term. This specific infant population should therefore be closely monitored, especially those with RSV\u2010hRV co\u2010infection.",
