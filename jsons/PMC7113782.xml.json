            "text": "Duck viral diseases have posed substantial risks to duck industry worldwide. Classical duck viral diseases include duck viral enteritis (DVE), duck viral hepatitis (DVH), and reovirus infection in Muscovy ducks. Since 1996, various novel viral diseases have emerged in ducks, such as avian influenza (Guo et al., 1999), reovirus related Muscovy duck new liver disease and duck spleen necrosis disease (Chen et al., 2009; Hu et al., 2000; Liu et al., 2011), Tembusu virus (TMUV) related egg drops in ducks (Su et al., 2011), and goose parvovirus (GPV) related short beak and dwarfism syndrome (SBDS) in Pekin ducks (Ning et al., 2017). Among the diseases, DVH can be caused by three duck hepatitis A virus (DHAV) genotypes (Ding and Zhang, 2007; Fu et al., 2008) and two duck astroviruses (DAstVs) (Fu et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2014), originally called duck hepatitis virus type 2 (DHV-2) and duck hepatitis virus type 3 (DHV-3); duck reovirus (DRV) of 2 genotypes infect ducks (Ma et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013).",

Although some of them could identify multiple targets, cross reactivity greatly limited their capability for simultaneous diagnosis of these main infectious viruses. Shen et al (2015) reported that the VP3-DHAV-1 based ELISA method could detect antisera to both DHAV-1and DHAV-3, indicating the presence of cross reactivity. Besides, some multiple detection methods for pathogenic viruses in ducks were established, such as a multiplex PCR method for simultaneous detection of six duck viruses with a lower detection limit of 102 copies/\u03bcl (Wang et al., 2017) and a GenomeLab Gene Expression Profiler (GeXP) analyzer-based multiplex PCR assay for simultaneous detection of eleven duck viruses with a lower detection limit of 103 copies/\u03bcl (Zhang et al., 2015). Currently available techniques for virus detection, including viral isolation on embryos and cell cultures, molecular diagnostic methods (such as polymerase chain reaction, PCR), and serological diagnostic methods (such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA), either are time-consuming, or require complex nucleic acid extraction, or have insufficient sensitivity.",

Recently, a multiplex PCR and MS based detection method has been reported in clinical virology and demonstrated as a promising method for high-throughput diagnostic or genotyping applications (Singhal et al., 2015). This method includes three procedures, multiplex PCR for amplification of target nucleic acids, single base extension for the mass probe and MS for identification of the products. This method has been successfully used in diagnosis of various viral infections, like foot and mouth disease (Peng et al., 2013b), human herpesvirus infection (Sjoholm et al., 2008) human papilloma virus infection (Peng et al., 2013a), and coronavirus infection (Xiu et al., 2017).

            "text": "The main merit of the proposed method is high throughput. This MS-based method could detect up to 30 targets in one reaction at the same time, and the maximum 384 samples could be analyzed within a single experiment (Peng et al., 2013a), which greatly improve the detection efficiency. On one hand, it could be used for diagnosis during the period of disease outbreaks. On the other hand, it could also be used for routine screening of pathogenic viruses in faces on the farm\u2019s ground, eggs, and newly-born ducklings, providing an alternative diagnostic method for disease surveillance. Waterfowl are the main reservoir of various viruses, and several various detection panels could be customized according to the sequence of popular strains. The method could be very useful for large-scale epidemiological research studies in investigation of different viruses which is of interest. As co-infection clinical samples were not available for this study, the mock samples were prepared for simulation of clinical co-infection. Four types of mixtures were used to evaluate this method. As expected, the target pathogenic viruses could be identified accurately in all the samples, including RNA and DNA viruses.",
