A visit to a village affected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and malaria in tropical Africa, to a shanty town in south Asia with inadequate water and sanitation (\nFigure 1), or to a displaced community in southern Somalia suffering from cholera, dysentery and Rift Valley fever, suggest that these aims are yet to be fulfilled.",

The first is the overwhelming disadvantages faced by health workers surrounded by HIV/AIDS, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, overcrowding and lack of resources for the most basic of hygiene activities. The second is the impossibility of knowing the magnitude of hospital-related infections and optimum treatment strategies without effective laboratory services. These comments would certainly have been equally appropriate 10 or 15 years ago. Might 2007 be a turning point? With the current emphasis of governments and UN agencies to focus again on poverty and health, there is an opportunity to move healthcare-related infections, and the support required in terms of laboratory development, education, hospital infrastructure, and appropriate professional training, into a focused agenda, rather than the \u2018Cinderella\u2019 position that has until now been the case.",

Largely due to the UN and WHO Global Aids Programme, there is considerable literature and guidance available.10 At the level of the individual, poorly resourced hospital with limited reuseable equipment and disinfectants, HIV is a major concern for all health workers and local health education and support programmes have been shown to be effective.11 With the rise in HIV, there has been an increasing prevalence of tuberculosis, both in HIV-affected patients but also in the wider community, and in many areas an increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB). This poses a risk for nosocomial transmission between patients, but particularly for health workers who will have direct contact, often with undiagnosed cases, and with less than adequate protective clothing.12 There are likely to be few rural hospitals in Africa with a supply of PFR95 masks. The strict barrier precautions described by UK and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines are unlikely to be practicable and workers dealing with these issues daily have developed more appropriate strategies.13\n",

The source may be an inadequately isolated index case, relatives who are staying in the hospital to provide food and general care for patients, or contaminated food or water in the hospital. Although from observation such transmission must occur, few such episodes have been recorded. Nosocomial outbreaks of cholera have been published from Tanzania and Mozambique and these reports suggest that outbreaks of other faecal-oral infections, particularly shigellosis, typhoid and hepatitis A and E, must also occur.14, 15 Other reported hospital communicable disease outbreaks have included measles and non-typhoidal salmonellae.16, 17 For communicable diseases in the tropics, the boundary between hospital and community infection is blurred. Among relatives camping within the hospital compound, there may be a case of undiagnosed tuberculosis? Is the infected person part of the community or part of the hospital? This distinction between public health and healthcare-related infection is particularly complex in the setting of refugee camps.18, 19\n",

The catalogue includes: poor building infrastructure, inadequate water supply, electricity for perhaps only a few hours a day, overcrowded wards with patients lying on the floor as well as on beds, lack of resources for cleaning the environment, beds or equipment, often an absence of soap, and remoteness from regional centres or the capital city. Maridi, the hospital of the 1976 Ebola outbreak in southern Sudan, is 1800 km from Khartoum, with a road link not possible for three months in the rainy season. This situation is compounded by civil strife in the Democratic Republic of Congo, southern Somalia or Darfur, for example, where hospitals may have influxes of patients with both infected injuries and communicable diseases.34, 35 As patients with communicable diseases are admitted from crowded refugee camps, they may become the index cases for further spread within the hospital if infection control facilities are overstretched (\nFigure 3).",
