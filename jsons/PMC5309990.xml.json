            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a serious hypoxaemia and progressive dyspnea condition which is caused by various direct or indirect factors leading to the development of acute lung injury. Although medical technology is more and more advanced and modern medicine for ARDS has been further systematic in pathological physiology, diagnosis and treatment scheme, mortality rate due to ARDS is still high [1]. The study found that fatality rate of patients with severe ARDS was as high as 62% [2]. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a feasible life-saving support therapy for patients with severe ARDS that is refractory to conventional mechanical ventilation (MV) [3]. Originally applied to support the respiratory function of pediatric patients with good results [4], the use of ECMO has been progressively extended to adult population [5]. Key factors for the indication of ECMO are represented by prognosis of the underlying disease, timing, quality of life of survivors and the possibility of being lung transplant candidate [6]. Main ventilation strategy of ECMO is to allow lungs of patients to rest and maintain theiropening, in order to get opportunity for treatment of lung disease [7].",

ECMO was started at 13:20 on March 13 for our patient, dramatic decrease in platelets (PLT 48x109/L) was found on March 15. Skin ecchymosis was appeared in the groin where catheters were placed on March 19, subcutaneous hemorrhage occurred in fingers and left thigh of the patient, platelet had fallen to 21 \u00d7 109/L. But more worrying was that bloody liquid was sucked out from bronchi and platelet transfusion did not work. Through discussion with experts, ECMO was withdrawn at 17:05 on March 19, and thrombopoietic treatment and platelet monitoring were continued, finally, the platelet returned to the normal range on April 3. Infection is another side effect of the application of ECMO. Four days after hospitalization, BLF, sputum and blood stream infection with multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii occurred in our patient, which could lead to septic shock and death.

Our patient was cured and went back to her previous quality of life at last, thanks to ECMO giving her time to get treatment. This case suggests that a multidisciplinary team, involving critical care and infectious diseases experts, is very critical to define whether ECMO is an adequate therapeutic option also in patients with severe pulmonary infectious diseases. We recommend treatment with ECMO as early as possible, but more clinical evidence is required to support this view. Further studies are needed to understand how to best utilize and optimize ECMO therapy in patients with ARDS.
