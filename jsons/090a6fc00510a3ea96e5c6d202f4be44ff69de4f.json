Recent publications for gastrointestinal procedures provide important information regarding patient benefit for the most common indications for colonoscopy: screening, surveillance, and follow-up of fecal immunochemical test (FIT) results. Higher risk patients include FIT positive patients who are approaching six months from their test (after which there is a significantly increased risk of disease progression) 9-12 ; symptomatic patients (e.g. dysphagia, weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding, inflammatory bowel disease flare, etc.); laboratory abnormalities suggestive of acute disease (e.g. acute or progressive iron deficiency anemia, abnormal imaging, obstructive jaundice, etc.); and patients with large or incompletely resected polyps. 13 Understanding disease risk around these factors can inform prioritization of COVID-19 relative procedure backlogs during re-opening and ongoing mitigation/suppression control measures, which may include repeated partial closures during local increases of disease incidence (Table   1 ). For example, a risk measurement process at KPNC to identify and schedule pending routine and high risk (FIT +, post cancer, high risk adenoma follow up) patients awaiting colonoscopy across all 21 facilities in KPNC in late 2019 and in early 2020 resulted in a 33 percent reduction in such patients within 10 weeks, from approximately 11,000 to 8000. However, after California's shelter in place orders were implemented, the number of patients awaiting colonoscopy initially plateaued and then rapidly rose to over 12,000, exceeding the pre-COVID numbers. These risk measurement methods can now be used to prioritize patients for early scheduling of high-risk patients (Table 1) .",

While COVID-19 hospitalizations began subsiding in parts of California in late April, new cases continue to arise, lending considerable uncertainty to estimates of community transmission risk. Because patients presenting for procedures/surgery may also be at risk for COVID-19-related complications, KPNC is using regional data to identify patient characteristics associated with COVID-19 deterioration. Among 2,168 KPNC patients with COVID-19 positive tests in our system at the time of analysis, we corroborated external reports that younger age and lower comorbid disease burden are associated with lower rates of hospitalization, critical care, mechanical ventilation, and death. 14 These data assist our clinicians in stratifying patients based on their risk of COVID-19 complications.",

For relevant indications (e.g. evaluation of a colon mass seen on radiologic imaging), if such patients are unlikely to tolerate surgery, they are less likely to benefit from endoscopy. To assess surgical risk for all types of operations, we developed a risk score incorporating age, comorbid disease burden, and surgical venue for predicting post-surgical major morbidity or mortality using National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) definitions. This model demonstrated good discrimination for identifying patients at risk for post-surgical complications (c-statistic of 0.77 in training and test sets including a total of 144,784 patients) and is now being automatically calculated in our surgical reopening electronic health record dashboards. Detailed online tools from the NSQIP risk calculator are available to quantify patient surgical risk. 15 Applying such risk tools to our deferred surgical cases (all types of surgery), 39% of patients were at low COVID-19-related-risk; for surgical risk 76% were low-risk, 23% medium-risk, and 1% high risk. These perioperative risk scores help contextualize discussions between surgeons and patients related to surgical timing during the reopening period.",

Throughput for gastrointestinal procedures was challenged by the GI multi-society recommendations for airborne precautions for all patients, extending room dwell time for 45 minutes after each case to allow for adequate air exchanges. 17 Thus, expansion of SARS-CoV-2 pre-procedure testing prior to bowel preparation can allow for more standard room turnaround times and use of standard PPE rather than airborne precautions for test negative patients. Similarly, for surgical cases, as testing capacity increases, preoperative SARS-CoV-2 testing can clarify airborne PPE requirements for high-risk procedures (i.e., endotracheal intubation, airway procedures) and to ensure that those with an anticipated ICU stay are at low risk for COVID-19 complications during recovery. 18 There is a complex interaction between test performance characteristics, background prevalence, and the potential for false negative (or positive) tests. This may influence confidence in using lower levels of PPE in test-negative persons, for conservation of this vital resource, particularly in regions with a very high prevalence of active infections. Performance characteristics depend, in part, on the test used (some rapid point of care tests may have lower sensitivity); adequacy of sample acquisition; and disease burden (a person with lower viral burden may be both less infectious and less likely to test positive). A disease prevalence of 3%, for example, would result in a negative predictive value of 99.7% for a test with 90% sensitivity (and 90% specificity) and 99.0% for a test with 70% sensitivity. After taking into account that patients with symptoms typical of infection can be treated as COVID positive, as regards PPE precautions, however, the joint probability appears extremely low of: a person being infected; being asymptomatic; having a false negative test; and standard PPE usage in this patient leading to spread of disease within a healthcare setting. To minimize false negative testing, we recommend using higher sensitivity tests (and updating test type as methods improve), having testing performed by trained personnel for adequate sampling, and adjusting evaluations as needed if community prevalence surges (thereby potentially increasing the proportion of total people tested who have a false negative test).",

Alternative methods, for example, can be used for lower-risk patients needing screening and surveillance endoscopic examinations. Patients originally scheduled for screening colonoscopy can instead utilize a FIT testing approach while awaiting colonoscopy. This allows higher-risk patients to complete colonoscopies, while providing average-risk patients with guideline concordant care. Fecal testing can particularly be recommended to patients whose risk of complications from COVID -19 risk is high, such as those over age 60 and those 50-59 with at least one serious comorbidity. Concordant with recent gastrointestinal society guidelines, patients with a history of 1-2 small adenomas scheduled for follow up five years after their initial exam can instead be recommended for testing at 7-10 years, given their long-term risk appears comparable to people without any adenomas. 21",

In the setting of ongoing, albeit lower, rates of COVID-19, reopening deferred procedures/surgeries requires a balanced and data-driven framework that prioritizes the timing of procedures based on medical urgency (patient likelihood of benefit), COVID-19 risk, procedural risk, and the availability of PPE and preoperative SARS-CoV-2 testing. This framework may help minimize the potential impact of deferred care, and diminish additional waves of adverse outcomes among those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, until the threat of recurrent viral infection surges abates. The uncertainty of this pandemic calls for healthcare systems to prepare for sustained mitigation/suppression and the commitment of physicians and patients to discuss critical peri-procedural and procedural decisions together. * The availability of personal protective equipment is a key overarching consideration for effective and sustainable procedure/surgical re-opening. Additional factors for consideration include anesthetic approach, home versus inpatient recovery, local COVID-19 case activity, public health agency guidance and regulations, and regional aggregate procedural-related care availability.",
