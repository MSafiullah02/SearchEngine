Though the outlook remains uncertain, COVID-19 has already caused far greater morbidity and mortality than other human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).1 To limit disease transmission, the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention recommended protective behaviors such as hand hygiene and social distancing.2 Mass adoption of these behaviors is especially important when pharmacological interventions are not yet available.3 According to theories of decisions about health behavior, people who perceive greater risks are more motivated to implement protective behaviors.4, 5, 6 Hence, assessing associations between risk perceptions and protective behaviors has practical and theoretical relevance.",

It is unclear how people perceive the risks, or whether their initial risk perceptions inform their decisions about protective actions.8 Therefore, the study objective is to examine people's initial risk perceptions for COVID-19 infection and infection fatality, as well as associations of these initial risk perceptions with self-reported protective behaviors. Because the survey was completed between mid-to-late March 2020, the authors were able to add exploratory analyses to examine how risk perceptions, protective behaviors, and their associations varied as the initial stage of the epidemic unfolded.",

To assess perceived infection fatality risk, participants were asked: If you do get infected with the coronavirus, what is the chance you will die from it? Both assessments were provided on a validated 0%\u2013100% visual linear scale.7 Participants were also asked to report on protective behaviors: Which of the following have you done in the last seven days to keep yourself safe from coronavirus in addition to what you normally do?

Responses referred to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2013recommended behaviors,2 including (1) washed hands with soap or used hand sanitizer several times per day; (2) avoided public spaces, gatherings, or crowds; (3) avoided contact with people who could be high-risk; and (4) canceled or postponed air travel for work and canceled or postponed air travel for pleasure, for which responses were combined.

To answer the main research question about the relationship between risk perceptions and protective behaviors, authors conducted separate logistic regressions predicting each of the protective behaviors, including handwashing, avoiding crowds, avoiding contact with people who could be high risk, and canceling or postponing air travel. Because ORs for continuous scales with small units (such as the 0%\u2013100% risk perception scales) can be difficult to interpret, these logistic regressions were conducted with the quartile-based risk perceptions as predictors (Tables 3\nand 4\n). Specifically, respondents were divided into quartiles by perceived risk (or four similar-sized groups of respondents giving the lowest 25% to the highest 25% of responses). The authors also created graphs presenting the percentage of participants who reported protective behaviors, by quartile of risk perception (Figure 3\n). Analogous logistic regressions with continuous risk perceptions yielded similar results (Table 5\n), as did Pearson correlations that did not include control variables (Table 6\n). In each of the reported logistic regressions, predictor variables were perceived infection risk and perceived infection fatality risk for COVID-19, while accounting for whether or not participants responded later (between March 13 and 31, 2020=1; between March 10 and 12, 2020=0); were in the at-risk group aged \u226565 years (yes=1, no=0); identified as male (yes=1, no=0); identified as African American (yes=1, no=0), Hispanic/Latinx (yes=1, no=0), or another minority (yes=1, no=0) versus white; had a college degree (yes=1, no=0); and lived in one of the states that was worst hit at the time of the survey (California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, or Washington=1; other state=0).",

Another limitation is that behaviors were self-reported, and may have reflected social desirability bias.18 Longitudinal studies are needed to understand how risk perceptions, protective behaviors, and their associations changed over time, beyond the early stages of the epidemic.13\n,\n15 Over time, it is possible that people who take actions to protect themselves may subsequently perceive less COVID-19 risk. As an example, people who have received a seasonal influenza vaccination have been found to lower their perceived risk afterward.15 These analyses included no measures of perceived uncertainty or timing of the risk, which would have been needed to further understand the role of psychological distance in hesitancy to act on initial risk perceptions. The analyses also included no measures of other factors that could have potentially motivated protective behaviors, such as perceptions of the chance of infecting others, social norms, the ability to implement protective behaviors and bear any associated costs, or the need to follow policymakers\u2019 recommendations and stay-at-home orders.4, 5, 6\n",
