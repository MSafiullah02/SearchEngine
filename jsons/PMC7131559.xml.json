            "text": "Diarrhoea in lambs and kids can be defined as a complex, multi-factorial syndrome. Interactions between animal susceptibility, nutritional status, environmental factors, flock/herd management and a variety of infectious agents acting often in a synergistic mode may influence the onset and evolution of the disease. Common bacterial causes of diarrhoea in lambs and kids during the first month of life are Escherichia coli, Cryptosporidium spp., Salmonella spp. and Clostridium spp. (Tzipori et al., 1981, Holland, 1990, Uzzau et al., 2001). Rotaviruses are also often associated with enteric disease in small ruminants (Alkan et al., 2012). However, in general, the role of viruses in the syndrome still remains largely unexplored and likely overlooked. Recent advances in the diagnostics and metagenomic investigations of the enteric environment have provided clues to understand the diversity of small ruminant enteric virome. By reviewing the literature, we provide herewith an update on the enteric viruses identified in small ruminants and eventually associated with enteric disease, on the basis of either observational or experimental studies.",

Asymptomatic infections or prolonged shedding of virus after acute infection are frequent. The virus is shed with nasal secretions, faeces and/or urine. Young animals with low or no maternal immunity are more susceptible to adenovirus infection. Morbidity in a flock/herd is high, while mortality is influenced by age, adenovirus type/strain and eventual co-infections with other pathogens (Belak, 1990).",

Respiratory signs tend to persist, evolving into a chronic form. Sometimes, only respiratory sign are observed (Belak, 1990), while in other cases the enteric form is predominant (Smyth et al., 1994). Fatal hyper-acute infections may also occur in neonatal lambs (DeBey et al., 2001). The disease observed in kids is similar, with enteric and respiratory signs being described in those animals (Lehmkuhl et al., 1997, Lehmkuhl et al., 2001, Olson et al., 2004).

Small round virus-like particles were observed by electron microscopy in the faeces of lambs 4\u20136 weeks of age with acute diarrhoea. Virions with a typical five-to-six pointed star shape were clearly distinguishable in some samples. Faecal filtrates from a naturally infected lamb were given orally to a gnotobiotic lamb, which subsequently excreted the virus. Also, faecal filtrates of the experimentally infected lamb were given orally to two further gnotobiotic lambs, which developed diarrhoea and excreted the virus (Snodgrass and Gray, 1977). Infections in gnotobiotic lambs with the ovine astrovirus were repeated in a distinct experiment, and the infection determined mild diarrhoea after an incubation period of about 48 h. Astroviruses infect only mature villus epithelial cells and subepithelial macrophages in the small intestine, where they produce partial villus atrophy. Infected enterocytes are replaced with cuboidal cells from the crypts, and the lesion gradually heal by 5 days after infection (Snodgrass et al., 1979).",

The virus, prototype of the Nairovirus genus, is also known as Ganjam virus. Nairobi sheep disease is widespread in East Africa and India and it is transmitted by metastriate ticks, e.g. Rhipicephalus appendiculatus (Africa), Haemaphysalis wellingtoni, Haemaphisalis intermedia (India) (Marczinke and Nichol, 2002). The vertebrate hosts are sheep and goats, although the rat Arvicanthis abyssinicus may serve as a reservoir of the virus (Simpson, 1966). The disease may appear after introduction of na\u00efve livestock into an endemic area and it is regarded as one of the most pathogenic infection in small ruminants, with mortality risk rates as high as 90%, as animals die from acute haemorrhagic fever. The disease is observed only in sheep and goats, with less severe signs in the former species, whereas other ruminants are, in general, refractory to the infection. Signs of disease usually appear 4\u20136 days after the tick bite and start with fever, peaking to 42 \u00b0C and persisting for 1\u20137 days. Diarrhoea is usually observed 1\u20133 days after onset of fever, characterised by watery and fetid faeces that turn haemorrhagic in the following days. Infected animals may also display depression, respiratory distress with mucopurulent nasal discharge and pulmonary oedema, myocarditis and tubular nephritis. Pregnant ewes and goats often abort and the foetuses may display developmental defects (Montgomery, 1917, Weinbren et al., 1958). Nairobi sheep disease is a notifiable disease and sporadic cases of human infection have also been reported. An attenuated vaccine is available for its control (Davies et al., 1974).",

            "text": "\nRift Valley Fever virus (Phlebovirus), or Zinga virus, was first isolated from an epizootic of high mortality in lambs and abortion in pregnant ewes in the Great Rift Valley, Kenya, in 1930 (Daubney et al., 1931). Outbreaks of Rift Valley fever were limited to the African continent until 2000, when severe and simultaneous outbreaks of the disease occurred in Yemen and Saudi Arabia and later in Madagascar and Mayotte. The geographic expansion poses a threat to European countries (Chevalier et al., 2010), especially as Rift Valley Fever virus is a mosquito-borne infection, transmitted by insects of the genera Aedes and Culex (Chevalier et al., 2010). A number of vertebrate species are susceptible to Rift Valley Fever virus infection, including wild and domestic ruminants and rodents. While ruminants develop clinical signs, rodents, mainly rats of the genera Arvicanthis or Rattus, serve as reservoirs. Equines and pigs can also be infected, but do not display clinical signs. Fatal cases have been reported in dogs, cats and monkeys, and recently the virus was also isolated from bats (Olive et al., 2012). In humans, an influenza-like syndrome usually occurs, followed in a few cases by haemorrhagic, neurological or ocular forms (Pepin et al., 2010). Young ruminants, including lambs and kids, are prone to develop severe forms of disease, with mortality risk rates as high as 70%; in adult sheep, mortality risk rates are <10%. Lambs and kids younger than 7 days display a fatal hyperacute disease, with fever (40\u201342 \u00b0C), inappetence and weakness. Older lambs, and less frequently adult animals, are affected by an acute form, with fever (40\u201341 \u00b0C), vomiting, haemorrhagic diarrhoea, depression, muco-purulent nasal discharge, stiffness of gait and necrotic hepatitis. In adult sheep and mainly in goats, the disease course is subacute or subclinic. Abortions and teratogenesis in pregnant females are frequent (Gerdes, 2002). Although both modified attenuated and inactivated vaccines are available for prevention of Rift Valley Fever virus infection in ruminants, inactivated vaccines should be preferred, since attenuated modified vaccines are abortifacient in pregnant animals (Gerdes, 2002).",

The animals showed fever, milk drop syndrome and, occasionally, diarrhoea and abortion. The virus, named Schmallenberg virus, was found to be most similar to viruses of the Simbu serogroup, which includes Akabane virus and Shamonda virus (Hoffmann et al., 2012). These bunyaviruses are associated with arthrogryposis hydranencephaly syndrome in ruminants, but they have never been reported in Europe. The novel bunyavirus was subsequently detected in other European countries, causing disease in cattle, sheep and goats. Biting midges (genus Culicoides) seem to play a key role in the transmission of Schmallenberg virus infection, which is characterised by a seasonal spread with higher prevalence rates in summer and autumn. Vertical and venereal transmissions are also important (Tarlinton et al., 2012). Schmallenberg virus infection causes transient fever, diarrhoea and a decreased milk yield in adult cattle and, most notably, stillbirths and severe malformations in lambs and calves (Beer et al., 2013). The first clinical report of Schmallenberg virus in sheep described malformations consistent with the arthrogryposis hydranencephaly syndrome in lambs born in late 2011 (Van den Brom et al., 2012). Although Schmallenberg virus-induced diarrhoea has been reported mainly in cattle, experimental infection of sheep predominantly resulted in subclinical infection, with a single animal displaying diarrhoea for several days (Wernike et al., 2013). Schmallenberg virus is not believed to be a zoonotic agent and an activated vaccine has been recently licensed for protection of cattle and sheep.",

Upon electron microscopy, particles with norovirus size and morphology were observed. Also, upon sequence analysis of the capsid gene, the virus was classified within genogroup (G) III, along with other bovine noroviruses. However, due to the observed genetic diversity in the capsid gene, the ovine strain (Ov/Norsewood30/2007/NZL) has been proposed as a third GIII genotype, which has not been described yet in other ruminants.",

Although bovine coronavirus-like viruses have been found to circulate in small ruminants, their pathogenic role in the aetiology of diarrhoea of lambs and kids remains largely unknown. Bovine coronavirus antibodies have been detected in 19% of 218 Swedish sheep serum samples, with increased frequencies in animals in large flocks and in animals older than 4 years (Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n et al., 1999). In addition, coronavirus-like particles have been observed in faecal samples from sheep under electronic microscope examination (Tzipori et al., 1978, Pass et al., 1982). However, results of virological investigations on faecal samples from lambs and kids with diarrhoea are contrasting. An investigation in small ruminants in Spain did not detect coronaviruses in diarrhoeic newborn animals (Mu\u00f1oz et al., 1996), whilst a mixed infection by rotavirus and coronavirus was reported in lambs with diarrhoea in Arizona (Harp et al., 1981). More recently, a coronavirus has been associated with fatal diarrhoea in a kid in Turkey (Ozmen et al., 2006).",

Within Rotavirus A, at least 27 G and 37 P types have been reported in mammalian and avian strains (Matthijnssens et al., 2011). The distribution of G and P type specificities across the various animal species shows peculiar host species-specific patterns, as the results of host range restrictions (Matthijnssens et al., 2009a).

Reports on ovine or caprine Rotavirus A are available from various countries world-wide, with detection rates reaching 60% and an estimated 10\u201330% mortality (Makabe et al., 1985, Mu\u00f1oz et al., 1996, Legrottaglie et al., 1993, Wani et al., 2004, Galindo-Cardiel et al., 2010, Alkan et al., 2012, Gazal et al., 2012, Papp et al., 2014). Rotavirus A strains with G3, G6, G8, G9 and G10 and with P[1], P[3], P[5], P[8], P[11], P[14] and P[15] types have been identified in small ruminants (Ciarlet et al., 2008, Papp et al., 2014). Some types (G6, G8, G10, P[1], P[5], P[11]) are common with cattle, suggesting free circulation among ruminants, while other types (G3, P[3], P[14], P[15]) seem to be more peculiar of small ruminants. During outbreaks of neonatal diarrhoea by Rotavirus A, prevalence in faecal samples and lamb morbidity/mortality may be very high (Chasey and Banks, 1984, Theil et al., 1996). Rotavirus B have also been associated with diarrhoea in goat kids (Mu\u00f1oz et al., 1995, Mu\u00f1oz et al., 1996). Limited relevant information is available for Rotavirus C (Mu\u00f1oz et al., 1996).",

Several steps have been taken in recent years towards understanding of the role of viruses as causative agent of enteritis in these animals, with a number of novel viruses being discovered. Yet, it is likely that novel viruses will be discovered in the next years. Developing effective diagnostic tools and implementing the diagnostic algorithms of viral enteritis will allow gathering important epidemiological data and will help filling the existing large gaps in the knowledge.",
