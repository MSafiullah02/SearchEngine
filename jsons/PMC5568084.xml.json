At a minimum, each patient room should have an anteroom for donning and doffing. Some facilities include an anteroom for donning and then a separate exit-room for doffing.6 Although an exit-room is not necessary for an airborne pathogen, this design allows for unidirectional flow of patients, staff, and materials through the care space to limit the possibility of cross-contamination, particularly in the context of contact-transmitted pathogens, such as Ebola virus (EBOV) or other viral hemorrhagic fevers. This principle of unidirectional flow is a cornerstone of Ebola Treatment Centers in Africa.9 Each unit should have an exit space where staff can shower after their care shift and change into clean clothing before exiting the unit. The unit should be equipped to provide critical care services and, depending on the local need, should anticipate caring for additional patient populations, including children and pregnant women.6\n",

Each contaminated area is designed to have a pressure differential of at least \u22120.02-in water gauge to adjacent areas (twice the requirement for an AII). This design ensures that air does not travel from a contaminated to a clean space. All intake air is filtered using a minimum efficiency reporting value 16 filter that captures 99% of 1.0 \u00b5m particles; no air is recirculated. The anteroom air is changed at least 10 times per hour, whereas the patient room air is changed 12 to 15 times per hour, in accordance with AII guidelines. The air intake is on the ceiling, whereas the exhaust ports are on the wall close to the floor. This location creates laminar flow, away from a health care worker\u2019s face. The negative pressure for the unit is maintained by 2 rooftop fans, each equipped with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters that capture 99.99% of particles with a size of 0.3 \u00b5m.

Most of these patients (82%) survived, largely because they received high-quality, supportive critical care.7 Planning and delivering care to these patients was labor and resource intensive and took place in a few specialized centers. The cost to establish an Ebola treatment center in the United States has been estimated to be $1,200,000, whereas the cost to care for a single patient in this setting may be as high as $30,000 per day.69, 70 Secondary transmission of EBOV to health care workers in a community hospital in Texas served as a stark reminder of the risks associated with caring for patients with EVD and the need for adequate resources, planning, and training to mitigate risk.71\n",
