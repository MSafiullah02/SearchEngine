Most experts would agree that this has been due, in part, to the sparse availability of diagnostic assays. Hence, currently, there is a massive, worldwide effort to provide diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 infections. According to the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics website [7], as of April 9, 2020 there were more than 470 molecular and immunological assays in the development pipeline. However, few diagnostics are available or being developed to detect other animal CoVs that may jump species to man. Hence, in this study we sought to design and test a new molecular diagnostic to detect most all CoVs, including those that have been previously identified and those that will be discovered in the future.",

A first RT-PCR amplification round was conducted using SuperScript\u2122 III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum\u2122 Taq DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Each 25\u00b5L first step reaction mixture contained 4\u00b5L RNA samples, 12.5\u00b5L 2X Reaction Mix (containing 0.4 mM of each dNTP, 3.2 mM MgSO4), 0.4\u00b5M of each primer (pan-CoV_outF and pan-CoV_R), SuperScript\u2122 III RT/Platinum\u2122 Taq Mix, and nuclease-free water to obtain a final volume of 25\u00b5L. The thermal profile included incubation at 55 \u00b0C for 30 min for reserve transcription, followed by incubation at 94 \u00b0C for 2 min to inactivate the reverse transcriptase enzyme. Following the reverse transcription, amplification was performed in the CFX PCR System (Bio-Rad, USA) according to the following program: 30 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 15 s, 53.4 \u00b0C for 30 s and 68 \u00b0C for 1 min; a final extension at 68 \u00b0C for 5 min; and holding at 4 \u00b0C. The conventional PCR for second step was carried out in 25\u00b5L volume containing 1\u00b5L of first RT-PCR product, 2.5\u00b5L 10X PCR Buffer (no magnesium chloride), 0.75\u00b5L 50 mM magnesium chloride, 0.5\u00b5L dNTP mix (dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP), 1\u00b5L of each primer (pan-CoV_inF and pan-CoV_R), 0.25\u00b5L Platinum\u2122 Taq DNA Polymerase, and enough nuclease-free water for a final volume of 25\u00b5L for each reaction. Finally, 599-602 bp of RdRp sequences were achieved by thermocycling using the following parameters: 94 \u00b0C for 5 min; 35 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 15 s, 54.5 \u00b0C for 30 s and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min; and a final extension of 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. To avoid possible contamination, positive and negative controls were contained in each run of the assay. The PCR products were kept at 4 \u00b0C until analysis by gel electrophoresis. Amplification products were electrophoresed and visualized on a 2% agarose gel together with a 100 bp DNA ladder at 120 V for 30 min. Sanger sequencing for positive samples was performed by Eton Bioscience Inc (Eton Bioscience, Raleigh, NC, USA).",

The results showed that the pan-CoV assay could accurately identify different CoVs without cross-reactivity with other non-target pathogens, demonstrating a high specificity for the primers used in this study (Fig. 3). Furthermore, Sanger sequencing confirmed the amplification of expected sequences from the tested samples (Table S3).

It seems clear that large-scale surveillance is needed to fully understand the role played by \u03b3-CoVs and \u03b4-CoVs in the emergence of human CoVs. Hence, this assay might be especially useful in detecting CoVs that are potentially pathogenic to humans from all four genera.

NGS has helped elucidate the evolutionary history of CoVs using a large amount of data generated by unbiased sequencing. However, some disadvantages limit the number of samples that can be sequenced. Although it becomes less expensive each consecutive year, the cost is still very high and the procedure includes time-consuming complicated library preparations and data processing. Hence, we posit that combined screening strategies are the most cost-effective way to identify new CoVs. We recommend employing novel coronavirus surveillance among people whose occupations or recreation cause them to have prolonged or frequent exposure to animals. We recommend screening them periodically, when healthy, for novel CoV nasal carriage and whenever they develop an acute respiratory illness. This surveillance might first include employing our pan-CoV assay and other pan-viral assays. When a novel virus is detected, the surveillance team might look for that same virus among the workers\u2019 animals. Having confirmed a novel virus in both an animal worker and his or her animals, further investigations might be employed through cell culture, full genome sequencing, and if indicated, seroepidemiology of both the worker and the animals.",
