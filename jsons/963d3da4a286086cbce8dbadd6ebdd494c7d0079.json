There is very limited data on the prevalence of neonatal disease in calves and prevalence data by itself is of limited value without some measure of severity or of necessity for economic intervention or without some measure of effect on production performance. Certainly many calves experience mild enteric disorders that d o not require therapy and which have no apparent long term effect on performance potential. Mortality from neonatal calf disease is more easily determined and is what is commonly used to reflect the prevalence and importance of neonatal calf disease.",

            "text": "A recent industry publication in the United States of America commented that 1 in 5 calves failed to survive to 4 months of age and area surveys of neonatal mortality have reported rates that vary in the range of 5 to 20% (Simenson 1982; Hancock 1983 ). Most surveys indicate considerable variation between herds and the existence of high risk and low risk herds. The preponderance of mortality occurs within the first 2 weeks of life. Mortality in neonatal calves is associated predominantly with the occurrence of septicemic and enteric disease. Respiratory disease is also a significant cause of mortality prior to weaning. Septicemic and respiratory disease in calves result from a complex, but poorly defined, interaction between specific infectious agents and the calf. This interaction can be profoundly influenced by environmental and other management factors. The majority of research on neonatal disease in calves has concentrated on the identification of specific etiological agents as the cause and on the interaction of these individual agents with the calf. Although this type of research is vital to the understanding of disease pathogenesis, the development of effective forms of therapy and the development of strategies for specific immunoprophylaxis, it is not necessarily the most important approach to the control of neonatal disease and strategies which influence the host, environmental or managemental determinants of neonatal disease may be equally or more cost effective. Within this context limitations to the realization of potential production imposed by the occurrence of neonatal disease in calves exist in several areas.",

A large number of infectious organisms have been associated with enteric disease in neonatal calves (Tzipori 1983; Acres 1985; Saif and Smith 1985; Shane and Montrose 1985) . These associations have been initially made on the basis of frequency of isolation or identification of these agents in the faeces of scouring calves as compared to non-scouring calves. The enteropathogenicity of many of these bacterial, viral and protozoal agents has subsequently been confirmed by experimental challenge of conventional or gnotobiotic calves. The advances in diagnostic technologies for the identification of these various organisms in the faeces of scouring calves have been substantial. In addition to traditional cultural and identification methods many diagnostic laboratories now utilise rapid technologies such as fluorescent antibody, ELISA or direct electron microscopy to facilitate specific agent identification and these methodologies allow information on agent association with outbreaks of diarrhoea to be rapidly available to the practitioner. However with some exception knowledge on the epidemiology of these infections has not kept pace with methods for their identification and other than immunoprophylaxis specific control procedures directed against individual causal agents are limited.",

From the loosely defined term of colibacillosis used 20 years ago it is now recognised E. coli have the potential t o produce both septicemic and enteric disease in calves. These diseases have a separate pathogenesis and the types of E. coli associated with each and their virulence attributes are quite different. E. coli associated with enteric disease have certain structural attributes, the most important of which are pili or fimbriae which enable them to attach to epithelial cells and thereby colonise the small intestine. There are currently 5 fimbrial antigenic types that have been associated with colonisation, the most important of which appears to be K99. In addition, these enterotoxigenic E. coli possess the ability to produce enterotoxin, which is the biochemical mediator of fluid secretion and results in the production of diarrhoea. In the case of enterotoxigenic E. coli associated with diarrhoea in neonatal calves, this enterotoxin is of the STa class. The knowledge of these attributes of 78 virulence has lead to the development of methods of specific immunoprophylaxis against diarrhoea associated with enterotoxigenic E. coli by the development of both vaccines and a monoclonal antibody preparation active against the K99 attachment antigen. Both have been shown effective in the prevention of E. coli diarrhoea. There is a potential for further developments in this area. STa has been sequenced and can probably be modified or complexed so that it is antigenic.",

At least 8 viruses have been associated with diarrhoea in calves. All of these infect either the villus or the crypt epithelial cells within the intestine to result in villous atrophy and the subsequent occurrence of a malabsorption-type diarrhoea. Limitations to the development of specific immunoprophylaxis against these agents currently include the inability to cultivate some in tissue culture and the development of methods of immunisation that will ensure high levels of enteric acting antibody throughout the neonatal period. Specific immunoprophylaxis for rotavirus and coronavirus is currently available, however, its antigenicity and efficacy has been questioned. The subject of virus-associated enteritis in calves and its immunophylaxis has been recently reviewed (Saif and Smith 1985) . In recent years, crytosporidium has been implicated as a primary or complicating cause of diarrhoea in calves in etiological surveys from many countries (Tzipori 1985) . The replication of cryptosporidium in the intestine is associated with villous atrophy, inflammation of the lamina propria, and diarrhoea of varying severity. There are currently no recognized anti-microbial products for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis and the organism is resistant to common disinfectants. In view of this, the development of specific immunoprophylaxis against cryptosporidiosis could be most pertinent. Current technologies should allow the identification of the surface antigen of cryptosporidium sporozoites associated with infection and the development of relevant immunological preventive measures.",

The commercial development of vaccines is dependent upon predicted commercial success based on the prevalence of an agent and its perceived importance. Even assuming the availability of vaccines against all of the common enteropathogenic agents, it is unlikely that their use would be economically viable. There are further objections to control based on a single causal agent approach. It is common to associate several enteropathogenic agents with a single outbreak of diarrhoea in calves and commonly 2 or more enteropathogenic agents may be isolated from the intestines of an individual scouring calf. Similarly, a multiplicity of agents are involved in outbreaks of calf respiratory disease. Many enteropathogenic agents and agents associated with respiratory disease are ubiquitous in the environment of the calf and can be isolated also from healthy calves. Under these circumstances, the occurrence of disease as apposed to infection appears more likely due to management factors that result in heavy infection pressure or in some way predispose the calf rather than to chance exposure of the calf to a single pathogenic agent.",

            "text": "Other than failure of passive transfer of colostral immunoglobulins to the calf the managemental and environmental determinants of neonatal enteric and respiratory d: Isease are poorly defined and as yet not quantified. Ventilation and microclimate are recognised as critical to the respiratory health of calves yet ventilatory designs of calf houses are based more on heat exchange and moisture removal than on aerosal and pathogen clearance. The success and acceptance of individual cold calf housing-the calf hutch-for calf rearing and calf health over the traditional communal calf house exemplifies the importance of environmental aspects in calf health. However in relationship to their potential importance in the control of neonatal calf disease there has been relatively little study of these determinats. Studies have identified important determinants such as group housing, types of housing and methods of feeding that can be acted upon to reduce the risk of mortality but other identified determinants such as season, size of herd and who feeds the calves need to be further quantified to identify the critical interactions before they are of practical value in evolving corrective or preventive strategies. There is however a real problem in accurately quantifying these determinants. For example stocking density in calving paddocks can have a profound influence on the occurrence of calf enteric disease in cow calf operations and Radostits and Acres (1980) have made an approach to define acceptable stocking densities in these situations. Ideally we should have knowledge of the relative risk for enteric disease associated with different stocking densities. However the descriptions of the calving paddocks situations in Radostits and Acres paper show how difficult it is to accurately define something as apparently simple as stocking density when one is working with on-farm situations. The establishment of the managemental and environmental determinants of neonatal disease in calves (or any desease in animal groups) will require an intensity of input and the development of methodologies equivalent to those inputs and methodological developments that are current in the laboratory identification of agents of neonatal disease and in the definition agent host interactions. Co-operating commercial farms will be the major setting for this type of research. Unfortunately in most institutions there is no structure or funding for research of this nature. Recent reviews of factors affecting the susceptibility of the neonatal calf to enteric disease emphasizes our lack of practical knowledge in this area (Ray 1980; Hancock 1983; Simenson and Norheim 1983) . There is a severe limitation placed on our ability to improve the potential production in cattle herds by this lack of information.",

            "text": "Neonatal calf disease can impair the potential productivity of herds through the costs of treatment and prevention, the costs of mortality, the loss of genetic potential, the avoidance of the potential for genetic improvement from superior but more costly semen because of fear of subsequent loss, the reduction or loss of potential elective culling and through a subsequent reduction in the lifetime potential production of recovered animals. Unfortunately, there is virtually no hard data on the economic effects of neonatal calf disease. The constraints that exist for the determination of the environment and managemental risk factors for neonatal disease also exist for the determination of economic factors associated with the complex and its control. For this reason most analyses deal purely with the effects of mortality and treatment costs. However an assessment of the economic effects requires some measure of prevalence and severity in order to determine nonmortality effects. Prevalence data is difficult to collect in onfarm situations unless non-farmer recording is used and the use of clinical scores for severity is notoriously inaccurate. One practical approach to this problem has been the use of records of treatment frequency and treatment costs as a measure of prevalence and severity of diarrhoea in on-farm situations (Andrews and Read 1983) . It is reasoned that mild diarrhoea as assessed by the owner will not be treated or will be treated with inexpensive preparations such as kaolin or pectin. More severe diarrhoea or general response to it is likely to result in treatment with a more expensive antibiotic. Similarly non-response or a more protracted course will result in more frequent treatment with increasingly more expensive drugs. Although this approach may not be an exact measure of the severity of disease or of its prevalence it represents an attempt to measure these factors by a method which is applicable and practical. Similar methodologies have been used to analyse respiratory disease (Miller el a1 1980) . Such practical methodolgies need to be developed and tested as an alternative to traditional but still inexact measures. A model had been developed for the economic analysis of the effects of respiratory disease in calves (Willadsen et a1 1977) and programs written to assist with the determination of costs and benefits associated with vaccination or other preventive measures against enteric disease. Although most considerations of neonatal disease deal with the direct costs of treatments, mortality, and the effects of mortality on replacement heifer policy there is some indication that neonatal calf disease can affect lifetime survivorship and lifetime production in affected calves that are treated and that recover. Anecdotal reports suggest that there is an effect of calfhood diseases, such as pneumonia, on subsequent time to first calving and on milk production. If such is true it adds a further dimension to the economic analysis of the effects of neonatal calf disease. The limited reports in the literature are somewhat contradictory on particularly neonatal disease associations with subsequent lifetime production but they d o indicate that such an association does exist in individual situations where neonatal disease has been significant (Simenson 1983; Britney et al 1985) . The lack of hard economic data on the effects of neonatal calf disease and on the benefits of various disease control strategies is a serious limitation t o improvements in productivity.",

Mention has been made above of the high prevalence of failure of passive transfer in dairy herds and the fact that this could be reduced by the application of current knowledge in a practical manner. A further example for this exists with veal calf rearing establishments. Veal calf establishments commonly experience a high morbidity and mortality from respiratory disease. It can be shown in many of these establishments that the entry immunoglobulin status of the calf is a prime determinant of subsequent morbidity and mortality. There are practical and cost-effective testing procedures that can identify calves at purchase with higher resistance to disease. The principles and methodologies underlying these selection procedures have been known for many years, however, very few veal calf establishements use them.",

Absence of suitable research or control approaches not only to well-known types of costly, insidious disease complexes (such as bovine mastitis), but also to new \"production diseases\" of unknown or presumably complex etiologies which are being recognised increasingly in industrialised countries.Inability of private veterinary practitioners and livestock producers in industrialised countries t o fully evolve economically and scientifically viable approaches to health maintenance in intensive livestock production. These 4 crises have one important element in common; they are all situations requiring identification, quantification and examination of multiple directly or indirectly causal and often interacting disease determinants. The tactical approaches listed by Schwabe (1982) for solving the crises are surveillance, intensive follow-up and epidemiological and economic analysis. These elements are the principal components of the epidemiological approach to population diagnosis.In the following sections we will illustrate current levels of epidemiological literacy as applied in some specific programs dealing with food animal disease problems in Denmark. Subsequently, we will describe and discuss some basic requirements for further developments of the epidemiological approach.",
