The highest similarity is observed with HCoV-229E and porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), 65% and 61%, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on gene 1a sequences indicates the presence of diverse HCoV-NL63 strains with distinct molecular markers.4 The increasing number of HCoV-NL63 sequences from several locations provides further evidence for this genetic diversity and confirms the presence of two main genetic clusters.10., 15., 16. However, drawing conclusions based on phylogenetic analysis of a single gene sequence and sometimes even a partial gene sequence requires caution as the true phylogeny can only be demonstrated by analyzing complete genome sequences. Full genome sequences of field isolates were, however, not available. Therefore, we sequenced the complete genomes of two HCoV-NL63 field isolates (Amsterdam 57 and Amsterdam 496) and genome fragments of 21 additional field isolates. Here, we present evidence for the in-field recombination of HCoV-NL63. Furthermore, we characterized the molecular variability of HCoV-NL63 isolates to have insight into the evolution of the virus. We observed high variability at certain genome regions and a molecular clock analysis revealed that the virus has been present in the human population for centuries.",

As the explorative bootscan analysis was not suggestive due to the low number of highly similar sequences and a stochastic noise that could not be distinguished from the real signal, we decided to analyze only the regions showing high number of informative sites. We analyzed the partial sequences of five regions (3K, 6K, 21K, 25K, and 26K) for 57, 496, NL and Amsterdam 1 isolates and nine additional patient isolates. The phylogenetic analysis confirms that in the 3K region the isolates Amsterdam 1 and 57 do cluster together in one subgroup while NL and 496 are located in the second (Figure 2, Figure 3\n). Phylogenetic analysis of the 6K region of several isolates reveals that the clustering pattern changes, with isolates NL, 496 and Amsterdam 1 in one subgroup and isolate 57 being an outgroup (Figure 2, Figure 3). In the 21K region the analysis shows that Amsterdam 1 is a single representative of one cluster, while NL, 496 and 57 are tightly clustering in the second group (Figure 2, Figure 3). Therefore, there is clear evidence that HCoV-NL63 isolates are mosaics with multiple recombinations along the genome.",

Along the genome the similarity between HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E is the highest, except for one part of the M gene. The similarity graph shows that the 3\u2032 region of the M gene has a higher nucleotide similarity to PEDV than to HCoV-229E (Figure 5(a)). Additionally, the bootscan analysis suggests recombination between an ancestral HCoV-NL63 strain and PEDV in that region (Figure 5(b)). To rule out that the observed effect is the result of convergent evolution we analyzed the synonymous substitution pattern between HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E. It has been described that the synonymous substitution rate is increased at genome regions, which originated from another species and may be used as a marker of gene transfer from another species.18., 19. Indeed a rise in the synonymous substitution rate in the 3\u2032 region of the M gene was observed (Figure 5(c)).",

Based on these sequence data, the evolutionary rate of HCoV-229E was calculated by Bayesian coalescent approach,20 serial ML estimate21., 22. and sUPGMA23 approaches. The evolutionary rates estimated with these three approaches were of very similar magnitude and were 3.28 \u00d7 10\u2212 4 (95% confidence interval, 1.72 \u00d7 10\u2212 4 to 5.00 \u00d7 10\u2212 4), 6.17 \u00d7 10\u2212 4 and 2.82 \u00d7 10\u2212 4 (95% confidence interval, 1.36 \u00d7 10\u2212 4\u20134.42 \u00d7 10\u2212 4) substitutions per site per year, respectively. Assuming a constant evolutionary rate in time and between the branches for HCoV-NL63 and HCoV229E, the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E was dated by the Bayesian coalescent approach around the year 1053 (95% highest posterior density interval, year 966 to 1142). This estimate was highly consistent under different demographic models, including an exponential growth (TMRCA around year 1105 (95% confidence interval, 1017 to 1188)), and expansion growth (TMRCA around year 1124 (95% confidence interval, 1038 to 1206)). A likelihood ratio test indicated that the molecular clock hypothesis could not be rejected (P\n = 0.05). We also attempted to date back the split of two HCoV-NL63 lineages, but due to several recombination spots in the spike gene region that we sequenced (see also Figure 4) this analysis was not possible. The 3K and 6K fragments could not be used because we only know the substitution rate for the 20,649\u201322,269 region in the HCoV-NL63 genome.",

Recombination was discovered by full genome sequence analysis of HCoV-NL63 variants from clinical samples. Analysis of several genome regions showed discordance in the phylogenetic clustering along the genome, a clear sign of recombination.

This high prevalence obviously increases the possibility of a recombination event through co-infection with another human or zoonotically transmitted animal coronavirus. Thus, recombination might enable highly pathogenic recombinant virus variants to arise. There is some evidence for recombination between PEDV and an ancestral HCoV-NL63 strain. Whereas HCoV-NL63 is mostly similar to HCoV-229E, a part of the HCoV-NL63 M gene shows the highest similarity to PEDV, suggesting a possible interspecies recombination event. The M protein is a key player in virus assembly and budding, thereby interacting with other structural viral proteins. The M protein of coronaviruses has been shown to span the virion membrane three or four times. The Nexo-Cendo topology is adopted by most coronaviral M proteins, but it has been proposed that the M protein of TGEV is present in the viral envelope in two topological states, Nexo-Cendo and Nexo-Cexo.37 The sequence analysis with the TMHMM v 2.0 prediction software\u2020\nsuggests a similar scenario for HCoV-NL63 (data not shown). Also the M protein of PEDV, but notably not HCoV-229E, shares these characteristics, which suggests that this domain of the M gene is obtained by interspecies recombination.",

The average substitution rate for this family was estimated to be 10\u2212 4 substitutions per year per site.38., 39. HCoV-NL63 is a member of the group I coronaviruses, with highest similarity to HCoV-229E and PEDV. These three species cluster with a recently described bat coronavirus (BatCoV, strain 61)40 in subgroup Ib. Our efforts to establish the substitution rate of HCoV-NL63 failed, as there is not enough sequence data available from isolates of past years. For this reason we decided to calculate the substitution rate for HCoV-229E, using partial sequences of the S gene from different dates. Based on this substitution rate, we dated the divergence time of HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 to the 11th century. The reliability of molecular dating is dependent on the validity of the molecular clock hypothesis, which assumes that the substitution rate is roughly constant. A maximum likelihood test confirmed that the molecular clock hypothesis is suitable for the coronavirus data set investigated here.",

For HCoV-OC43 it has been estimated that it emerged at the end of the 19th century or the beginning of the 20th century, implying that it has only been around for 100 years.41., 42. The SARS-CoV was introduced in humans in 2002, and for HCoV-HKU1, this has not been investigated. The heterogeneity of HCoV-HKU1, which appears in two separate genotypes and a third genotype that is a recombinant of these two genotypes,43., 44. suggests that this virus was not recently introduced into the human population, similar to the situation of HCoV-NL63. The divergence of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E was followed by a separation of HCoV-NL63 into two lineages, of which we suspect that this occurred at geographically distinct locations. Subsequently the two lineages recombined during co-infection, illustrated by the fact that all four full genome sequences available thus far display a mosaic genome organization.",

            "text": "The variability of coronaviruses has not been studied thoroughly. Although there are several reports concerning SARS-CoV, the relatively short time that this virus was present in the human population makes a long term study impossible. The first variable region of HCoV-NL63 encodes the three proteins nsp1\u2013nsp3. The biological function of nsp1 and nsp2 proteins is thought to be linked to virus replication.45., 46. The nsp3 protein is a coronaviral papain-like proteinase (PLpro) that is expected to be a multifunctional protein with several domains that mediate various enzymatic activities.47., 48. Thus, the high variability of this region might influence the viral replication and interaction with cellular proteins. The second variable region is located in the 5\u2032 part of the S gene. This region contains 24% of all polymorphic nucleotides, whereas it encompasses only \u223c 4% of the genome. The coronavirus S protein is an important determinant for the host cell specificity and tissue tropism, which is largely determined by the distribution of its receptor. Recently, Hofmann et al. reported that HCoV-NL63 uses the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) molecule as a receptor. The interaction of NL63-S with ACE2 is surprising, as HCoV-NL63 is closely related to HCoV-229E, which uses CD13 as a receptor. Furthermore, NL63-S shares no appreciable amino acid identity with SARS-CoV-S, which does use ACE2. The amino acid sequence of the CD13-binding site in 229E-S is 57% conserved in NL63-S, whereas the alignment of the ACE2-binding site of SARS-CoV-S with NL63-S reveals only 14% aa identity. These data suggest that NL63-S and SARS-CoV-S might have evolved different strategies to interact with ACE2. The receptor binding domain of NL63-S protein resides in the S1 region.49 Thus, the variability that we observed may alter the ACE2-binding properties of the S protein or, alternatively, the binding to a co-receptor.",
