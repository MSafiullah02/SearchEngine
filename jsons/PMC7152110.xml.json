A new class of influenza antivirals, neuraminidase inhibitors (Alves Galvao et al., 2014), greatly improves on the largely ineffective antivirals developed in the mid-1960s (Davies et al., 1964). The large number of antibiotics in use today was not available during the last pandemic and was totally absent from the \u201ctoolbox\u201d during the 1918 Spanish pandemic that caused the death of over 50 million people worldwide. This armory of drugs to fight infection has significant implications to not only human health but also the wider environment because of its inevitable release into the waste water through urine and feces and passage into sewage works and ultimately the rivers. The combination of huge volumes of drugs, the short span of time in which they are consumed, and the novelty of some of these drugs create a unique \u201cdownstream\u201d risk to society, critical infrastructure, and the environment. This chapter aims to highlight rare but catastrophic events such as epidemics and pandemics and the threats they pose to the environment and human health from coordinated medical responses.",

The mortality rate of the H5N1 in Southeast Asia back in 2005 was over 70%. It was this frightening mortality statistic that sparked the development and refinement of national pandemic preparedness plans (Health UDo, 2005), which included the stockpiling of antivirals. Hence, the degree to which society was prepared for the 2009 pandemic was a direct consequence of the looming threat from H5N1.",

Relenza (zanamivir; developed by Biota Holdings and manufactured and distributed by GlaxoSmithKline) was the first antiviral in a new influenza antiviral class called neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI). It was approved for the treatment of influenza A in the United States in 1999.

The risk of under- or misdosing using the disc inhaler was seen as a major barrier for Relenza, especially in those patients that find it hard to breathe and/or have asthma. However, Relenza was recognized as being more appropriate for children with renal insufficiency and pregnant women (Scientific Pandemic Influenza Advisory Committee, 2008). In addition, a stockpile of Relenza was seen as appropriate to prepare for the possible emergence of Tamiflu resistance. Relenza was also planned for use to prevent and treat influenza in frontline health workers at the earliest outset of Tamiflu resistance emergence (Scientific Pandemic Influenza Advisory Committee, 2008). On the balance of these factors, the United Kingdom acquired sufficient stockpiles of Tamiflu to treat 25% of the population, including prophylaxis and therapeutic prescription of the antiviral. This stockpile was further increased to cover up to 50% of the population at the outset of the pandemic (Fig. 3).",

Preexposure prophylaxic dosing was implemented to prevent infections before individuals were exposed to an infected contact, and postexposure prophylaxis dosing was implemented to prevent infections after an individual has been exposed to an infected contact. The clinical benefits acquired from antiviral treatment were maximal when given within 48 h of symptom onset, most notably reducing the time to symptom alleviation by roughly half of 1 day, increasing to 1 day in cases where influenza has been confirmed by laboratory tests (Team PIP, 2013). Early treatment with NAIs compared with late treatment significantly reduced mortality in hospitalized patients by 62% (Team PIP, 2013). Antiviral prophylaxis was more than 80% effective in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza when initiated within 48 h of initial contact (Team PIP, 2013). The evidence clearly supported the widespread use of antivirals for as much of the population as could be afforded.",

In the event that the influenza virus acquired reduced susceptibility to Tamiflu, it was expected that this challenge would be met by increasing the dose (Scientific Pandemic Influenza Advisory Committee, 2008). Hence, dosing would increase from the recommended dose for treatment (75 mg, twice daily, for 5 days) or prophylaxis (1 dose of 75 mg, once daily, for 10 days) to a dose to be determined empirically during the pandemic. In the event that antiviral resistance was seen to emerge, both NAIs may have been coadministered (Scientific Pandemic Influenza Advisory Committee, 2008); however, this did not occur, fortunately.",

Rates of secondary bacterial pneumonia among patients admitted to hospital with influenza have varied from 0.6% to 46% (Team PIP, 2011b). Influenza infection predisposes to secondary bacterial infection due to a combination of respiratory mucosal damage and a reduced capacity to mount an immune response to bacterial invasion (Team PIP, 2011b).

One might conclude that given the widespread use of antibiotics, an increase in their prescription on the order of 1%\u20135% might pose a negligible increased ecotoxicological risk to sewage work operation and the ecosystem services of the wider river environment. On the other hand, given that the primary mode of action of antibiotics is the inhibition and death of bacteria, it would be reasonable to assume that there is a concentration of antibiotics, above which, one might witness the loss of microorganisms performing essential functions in sewage works and the wider environment (i.e., a tipping point). The loss of these key bacteria from increased antibiotic uses during a pandemic was (and remains) the main ecotoxicological concern from pandemic usage of antibiotics.",

Upon consumption, approximately 80% of Tamiflu is converted to the active antiviral (oseltamivir carboxylate), with the remaining 20% leaving in the feces unchanged. There is considerable uncertainty with regard to the removal rate of any one drug in any one sewage works at any one time. It is expected that both antibiotics and antivirals would reach sewage works and pass right through them with relatively minimal loss (Jain et al., 2013). Antivirals, in particular, are seen as highly resistant to biodegradation (Prasse et al., 2010) and photodegradation (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2011; Fick et al., 2007). It is realistic to assume that antivirals could persist in the environment for sufficiently long enough to enter the drinking water system (Wang et al., 2016; Drinking Water Inspectorate, n.d.). For most modeling purposes and for predicting a realistic worst-case scenario, it is common practice to assume that sewage works and the wider environment do not result in significant loss in the drugs within the first 24 h.",

Wildfowl is attracted to the nutrient-rich, warm sewage outflows, exposing them to relatively high environmental concentrations of Tamiflu. The colocation of wildfowl and Tamiflu means that there is a risk of the avian influenza virus, naturally found in many wildfowl, to develop Tamiflu resistance. The concentration of Tamiflu predicted to be present in highly sewage-impacted rivers, such as in the United Kingdom, was expected to be sufficiently high to select for the Tamiflu-resistance gene in avian influenza, which would ultimately increase the risk of the next pandemic influenza strain containing the Tamiflu-resistance gene (Gillman et al., 2015; Orozovic et al., 2014). Application of ozonation to the sewage effluent would potentially reduce the load of antiviral released into the environment (Azuma et al., 2015); however, relatively few sewage treatment plants utilize such a treatment option, particularly in the United Kingdom, owing to the high cost and energy requirements.

Depending on the parasite, the antimalarial drugs include chloroquine, quinine sulfate, hydroxychloroquine, mefloquine, and a combination of atovaquone and proguanil (Malarone). Resistance to chloroquine has rendered the drug ineffective. The recommended treatment for malaria is currently a combination of antimalarial medications that include an artemisinin and either mefloquine, lumefantrine, or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine.

As of 2012, approximately 35.3 million people are living with HIV globally, with 1.8 million deaths from HIV/AIDS in 2010. HIV is transmitted from person to person through sexual contact, through blood, and during pregnancy to the child. There are several anti-HIV drugs: nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, which disable the protein needed by HIV to replicate (efavirenz, etravirine, and nevirapine); nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor, which forces the HIV to make faulty copies of itself (abacavir and combinations: emtricitabine-tenofovir (Truvada) and lamivudine-zidovudine (Combivir)); protease inhibitors, which disable required protein production (atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, and indinavir); entry or fusion inhibitors that block the HIV's entry into the target CD4 cells (enfuvirtide and maraviroc); and integrase inhibitors, which prevent HIV from integrating its genome into CD4 cells (raltegravir, elvitegravir, and dolutegravir). The use of these drugs is sufficiently high that they are now among the most frequently recovered drugs in waste water of countries heavily impacted by HIV/AIDS and reach concentrations over 100 \u03bcg/L (K'Oreje et al., 2012, K'Oreje et al., 2016).

There is no treatment for chikungunya other than for the fever and joint pain. There remains no vaccine for the disease. As the transmission of chikungunya requires a mosquito vector, it will remain constrained to the geographic range of the mosquito vector; however, it can still reach pandemic levels as the range of the vector is quite substantial (Kraemer et al., 2015).",

Several antivirals have been investigated for their efficacy in treating dengue, including balapiravir, celgosivir, and chloroquine; however, none have shown beneficial effects on viremia or clinical outcome (Yacoub et al., 2016). The inability to control the day-biting anthropophilic mosquitoes is the main reason for the global spread of dengue (Yacoub et al., 2016). Promising avenues for breaking the transmission cycle of dengue have been to infect the mosquito with an intracellular bacterium, which reduces viral replication in the mosquitoes (Yacoub et al., 2016). The virus\u2019 reliance on a geographically restricted mosquito vector limits infection to those who live and visit tropical environments (Kraemer et al., 2015).

No antivirals have been reported to be effective for Zika, but one must assume that the experimental treatments used to treat dengue and chikungunya will be tested for their efficacy in this related virus.
