This original activity became known as the type I interferon (IFN) family, which grew to comprise 14 IFN alpha (IFN\u03b1) subtypes and a single IFN beta (IFN\u03b2) (originally called fibroblast IFN). It was later discovered in 1965 (Wheelock, 1965) that lymphocytes stimulated by mitogens also produced an antiviral activity that was eventually distinguished by chemical properties (acid lability), then antigenicity, which was called immune IFN after the cells that produced it; it was subsequently cloned as the type II IFN gamma (IFN\u03b3) (Gray and Goeddel, 1982). For the purpose of this article, these IFNs will be considered as \u2018the old IFNs,\u2019 and we will discuss herein, the subsequently identified \u2018new\u2019 members of the type I IFN family (IFN omega (IFN\u03c9) in 1985; IFN tau (IFN\u03c4) in 1996; IFN epsilon (IFN\u03b5) in 2004; IFN kappa (IFN\u03ba) in 2001) and the IFN lambdas (IFN\u03bbs), the type III IFN family, discovered in 2003.",

            "text": "The IFNs derive their name from their definitive antiviral activity through which they were first described, although their potency varies by three orders of magnitude among the different types. The types of IFNs are distinguished by sequence identity, genomic locus, distinct cognate receptors, and to a lesser extent by cell of origin and stimulus (see Table 1\n). The \u2018old,\u2019 classical type I IFN family comprises the IFN\u03b1 subtypes and IFN\u03b2, all encoded by genes in a genomic locus on HSA chromosome 9p (and the syntenic murine chromosome 4), which also contains the genes encoding the \u2018new\u2019 type I IFNs described below (Hardy et al., 2004). All type I IFNs bind their cognate cell surface receptors IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 and subsequently activate associated kinases Tyk2 and Jak1, respectively, leading to phosphorylation of the intracellular domains of the receptors and recruitment of signal transducers and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. The type I (and to some extent type II) IFN signaling has been the prototype system for the discovery and characterization of the JAK/STAT pathway (Stark and Darnell, 2012). This pathway regulates the expression of thousands of so-called IFN-regulated genes (IRGs) (Rusinova et al., 2013), which encode the effector molecules of the various type I IFN properties, including the antiviral IRGs, namely 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase, RNase L, PKR, viperin, and many of the so-called \u2018viral restriction factors.\u2019 Additional IRGs that regulate viral infection and replication have been elucidated by the studies of Schoggins et al. (Schoggins, 2014; Schoggins et al., 2011, Schoggins et al., 2014; Schoggins and Rice, 2011). Since their discovery as antiviral proteins, the \u2018older\u2019 IFNs have been further characterized as multifaceted cytokines that can modulate cell proliferation; survival; differentiation; and migration, and regulate virtually every effector cell of the innate and adaptive immune responses. They are involved in many pathologies including cancer, infectious, and inflammatory diseases; and IFN modulators are in use or in clinical trials for these conditions. While IFNs have a well-characterized protective role in host defense, excessive signaling is toxic, even lethal. Thus, the well-characterized and diverse pathways driving IFN signaling (Hertzog and Williams, 2013), are balanced by an intricate array of negative regulators to control potential side effects (Porritt and Hertzog, 2015). The large number of negative regulators and the nature of their targets, which function in many stages of the IFN production and action system, suggest the need to tightly regulate the response in a temporal and tissue-specific manner. It will be interesting to determine whether the \u2018controls\u2019 on signaling are the same for the \u2018new\u2019 IFNs as the older, well-characterized ones.",

            "text": "The endogenous form of human IFN\u03c9 was purified from peripheral blood leukocytes after Sendai virus infection (Adolf et al., 1990). The human IFN\u03c9 protein shares 61% amino acid identity with human IFN\u03b12 but only 26.2% and 28.21% with human IFN\u03b2 and human IFN\u03b5, respectively (see Table 2\n), but despite relative similarities in primary protein sequence, structural modeling predicts human IFN\u03c9 is more similar to IFN\u03b2 than IFN\u03b1 (Figure 1(a) and 1(b)\n). However, of the limited studies reported for IFN\u03c9, this cytokine demonstrates binding affinities for both IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 comparable to human IFN\u03b2, and a 5- to 10-fold more potent antiproliferative activity compared to human IFN\u03b1 subtypes (Jaks et al., 2007), with demonstrated antitumor activities in human cancer models (Horton et al., 1999). Beside activation of the canonical ISGF3 signaling pathway (Jaks et al., 2007), IFN\u03c9 along with IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2 has been shown to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkL (Ahmad et al., 1997), an SH3/SH2 domain\u2013containing signaling adapter involved in signal transduction in chronic myeloid leukemia (ten Hoeve et al., 1994). IFN\u03c9 also has disease associations, with reports of serum autoantibodies to this cytokine being a marker for autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type I, a multifaceted autoimmune disease (Husebye et al., 2009; Cervato et al., 2010). The crystal structure of IFN\u03c9 in complex with the extracellular domains of IFNAR2 and a truncated form of IFNAR1 has been determined (Thomas et al., 2011). When compared to these structures, it is clear that the ligand\u2013receptor interfaces consist of anchor points that are residues conserved across IFN subtypes. Both the high-affinity interface (between IFN\u03c9 and IFNAR2) and the low-affinity interface (with IFNAR1) are similar to the structure of a mutant IFN\u03b12-IFNAR2 and IFN\u03b2-IFNAR1, respectively (Thomas et al., 2011; de Weerd et al., 2013). The mostly hydrophobic interface with IFNAR2 is localized around the \u2018elbow\u2019 between the two extracellular subdomains of IFNAR2; while the interface of IFN\u03c9 with IFNAR1 is diffuse over the surface of the receptor with only two receptor residues on IFNAR1 identified as energetically critical for ligand binding, namely Tyr70 and Phe238 (Thomas et al., 2011). It has been shown recently that in the mouse system, IFN\u03b2 can bind to and signal through IFNAR1 independently of IFNAR2 (de Weerd et al., 2013). Given that IFN\u03c9 has a similar IFNAR1 binding affinity and similar antiproliferative potency as IFN\u03b2, it may be interesting to investigate whether IFN\u03c9 also binds IFNAR1 directly and signals independently of IFNAR2.",

Furthermore, it has an insertion of 13 amino acids (residues 135\u2013147) leading to an extension of the loop between helices C and D of IFN\u03ba that may protrude into the IFNAR1 binding domain, and thus could alter signaling (Figure 1(c)). Regardless, IFN\u03ba has been shown to utilize both IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 to induce an IFN-stimulated response element\u2013driven response, and the expression of IRGs characteristic of cellular responses to treatment with other type I IFNs (LaFleur et al., 2001). IFN\u03ba has also been shown to induce production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-10, suggesting a role for this cytokine in regulating immune cell function (Nardelli et al., 2002). Application of recombinant IFN\u03ba has been shown to protect human cells from two types of viral infection in vitro (LaFleur et al., 2001). Interestingly, two studies have investigated IFN\u03ba expression in keratinocytes infected with human papillomavirus (HPV) (DeCarlo et al., 2010; Reiser et al., 2011) with one group finding that HPV represses IFN\u03ba expression in human keratinocytes in vitro and in vivo (Reiser et al., 2011; DeCarlo et al., 2010). The other study showed compartmentalized expression, in that keratinocytes from patients infected with HPV lacked IFN\u03ba expression, whereas the stroma of cervical biopsy specimens showed elevated IFN\u03ba expression that increased in relation to disease progression (DeCarlo et al., 2010).",

            "text": "IFN\u03b5 is a novel type I IFN discovered and characterized by the Hertzog laboratory (Hardy et al., 2004; Fung et al., 2013). It is found in the same genetic locus as the other type I IFNs and has approximately 30% or 37% amino acid identity with IFN\u03b1 or \u03b2 (Table 2), respectively, and subtle differences in 3D structure based on modeling (Figure 1). The regulation and expression of IFN\u03b5 are different to the other type I IFNs suggesting a different function for this type I IFN. Whereas \u2018classical\u2019 type I IFNs are not expressed constitutively and are induced by pathogens via pathogen recognition receptor pathways, IFN\u03b5 is constitutively and most abundantly expressed in the glandular endometrial epithelium of the female reproductive tract (FRT) where expression is not inducible by pathogens, but is regulated by the hormone changes of the menstrual cycle. IFN\u03b5 gene expression levels are highest when estrogen is highest and lowest when progesterone levels are prominent. IFN\u03b5 levels are significantly reduced at embryo implantation (day 4.5) in the mouse, consistent with progesterone regulation of IFN\u03b5. IFN\u03b5 expression is barely detectable in postmenopausal women consistent with the other hormonal regulation data (Fung et al., 2013). Interestingly, IFN\u03b5 is weakly, but significantly induced in human ectocervical epithelial cells following exposure to seminal fluid (Sharkey et al., 2007) and 8 h postcoitus in the mouse (Fung et al., 2013). Additionally, Matsumiya et al. (2007) determined that in the HeLa (human cervical cancer) cell line, the TNF cytokine can stabilize IFN\u03b5 mRNA thus increasing IFN\u03b5 synthesis to result in increased TNF-mediated STAT1 phosphorylation. This group has since demonstrated a posttranslational regulation of IFN\u03b5 expression under basal conditions by the importin 9 transporter protein, as identified by mass spectrometry on proteins in HeLa cell extracts that are bound to the 5\u2032UTR of IFN\u03b5 (Matsumiya et al., 2013).",

IFN\u03b5 signals through IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 to induce typical IRGs such as ISG15, 2\u2032\u20135\u2032oligoadenylate synthetase, and IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 7.

IFN\u03b5\u2212\n/\n\u2212 mice are more susceptible to infection with Chlamydia muridarum bacteria and treatment of mice with recombinant IFN\u03b5 can protect against vaginal infection (Fung et al., 2013). These results are in stark contrast to previous studies that indicated that other type I IFNs exacerbated the pathogenesis of C. muridarum disease by activating cytotoxic T cells, which were largely responsible for the inflammatory cell damage in infection (Nagarajan et al., 2008). Thus IFN\u03b5 performs different, and in this case opposite, functions to other type I IFNs. This difference in activity is difficult to explain for IFN ligands that act via the same receptors. The unique expression pattern, regulation, and impacts on localized mucosal infections suggest a unique biological function for IFN\u03b5.",

As mentioned, however, IFN\u03b5 levels are not directly affected by these pathogens but rather by hormones that alterimmune system in the FRT and can increase susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections (reviewed in Wira et al., 2015). While type I IFNs are well characterized for their antipathogen effects, many pathogens have developed mechanisms to evade the type I IFN response and thus, IFN\u03b5, with its unusual induction and expression patterns, may circumvent such strategies and thus offer an avenue for the development of novel therapies in FRT infections.",

Furthermore, IFN\u03b5 was claimed to boost the adaptive immune response in vaccine adjuvant studies (Xi et al., 2012; Day et al., 2008). However, these effects were observed using adenoviral vectors containing the IFN\u03b5 gene, and since IFN\u03b5 was not quantified in these experiments, it is difficult to attribute the biological functions to IFN\u03b5 directly. Furthermore, our data (unpublished) suggest that recombinant murine IFN\u03b5 has approximately 100-fold less antiviral and antiproliferative activities and reduced immunoregulatory activity, compared with other type I IFNs, an observation which has also been demonstrated for IFN\u03b5 in other species (Yang et al., 2013; Guo et al., 2015).",

IFN\u03c4 is located in the type I IFN cluster in the bovine genome on chromosome 8 (Walker and Roberts, 2009) and its trophoblast expression can be regulated by ETS2 (Ezashi and Roberts, 2004) though it can also be induced by pathogens. More recently, IFN\u03c4 has been characterized for anti-inflammatory effects and induction of several ISGs, including IRF2 that may protect the conceptus from the maternal immune system and promote development (Choi et al., 2001, Choi et al., 2003). Similarly, in pigs, IFN\u03b4 (delta) was identified in trophoblasts during the preimplantation period in the uterus (Lefevre et al., 1998). Although originally it was thought that IFN\u03b5 might represent the human and murine equivalents of IFN\u03c4, it is notable that ruminant species have both IFN\u03c4 and IFN\u03b5 gene expression, suggesting different functions consistent with their expression by different cells and in response to different stimuli.",

In 2003, a new family of antiviral IFNs, the type III IFNs, was first described (Kotenko et al., 2003; Sheppard et al., 2003). This family consisted of three cytokines, IFN\u03bb1 (IL-29), IFN\u03bb2 (IL-28A), and IFN\u03bb3 (IL-28B) identified on human chromosome 19 (q13.13 region) (Kotenko et al., 2003; Sheppard et al., 2003). A fourth member, IFN\u03bb4, was identified later in 2013 and its expression and function is still being fully determined (Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2013). Although the function of type III IFNs overlaps with type I IFNs, they are structurally more similar to the IL-10 cytokine family and interact with a distinct receptor complex to initiate signaling (Gad et al., 2009). It is the restricted expression of this receptor complex which gives type III IFNs more specificity than type I IFNs.",

Their induction is mediated through the activation of the transcription factors IRF3, IRF7, and NF-\u03baB, although subtle differences exist in transcription factor activation in the regulation of type I and III IFN (Osterlund et al., 2007; Thomson et al., 2009; Iversen et al., 2010). This differential regulation at the transcriptional level may account for the observation that IFN\u03bb expression is more tissue-restricted than the type I IFNs: for example, one study found that IFN\u03bb expression was highly inducible upon stimulation in liver but not in the brain, whereas IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 were upregulated in both organs (Sommereyns et al., 2008). Additionally, a recent study identified a unique mechanism whereby intestinal epithelial cells, known to be high IFN\u03bb producers, can selectively upregulate type III IFNs, and not type I IFNs, through activation of a novel RLR pathway in a peroxisome-dependent manner and through activation of the transcription factors IRF1, NF-\u03baB, and IRF3 (Odendall et al., 2014). It is noteworthy that IFN\u03b1 genes do not have NF-\u03baB sites in their promoters.",

Upon engagement with this receptor, receptor-associated JAK kinases (Tyk2 and Jak1, as in the IFNAR complex) are activated, leading to the phosphorylation and activation of members of the STAT family of transcription factors, including ISGF3a, in a mechanism similar to type I IFN-induced signaling (Dumoutier et al., 2004). This leads to the upregulation of genes with antiviral functions, similar to the type I IFNs. Indeed type I and type III IRG signatures have been shown to be redundant and no distinct type III IFN gene profile has yet been identified (Crotta et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2007).",

            "text": "It is the restricted expression of IL-28R\u03b1 that makes the type III IFN response more specialized than the more ubiquitous type I IFN response. IL-28R\u03b1 is predominantly expressed by epithelial cells at mucosal surfaces, including the gastrointestinal tract, reproductive tract, and respiratory tract, and by some immune cell subsets such as dendritic cells (Mordstein et al., 2010; Sommereyns et al., 2008; Witte et al., 2009). Subsequently, the type III IFNs have emerged as major protective factors at mucosal sites. For example, type III IFNs protect airway epithelial cells from respiratory viruses such as influenza A and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Mordstein et al., 2008, Mordstein et al., 2010). In the intestine, type III IFNs, and not type I IFNs, protect intestinal epithelium from enteric viruses (Pott et al., 2011; Mahlak\u00f5iv et al., 2015). However, this family of cytokines are proving to have more diverse roles than just antiviral immunity, with a recent focus shifting to their role in allergic asthma, where they not only control bronchial rhinovirus infection, an infection that can trigger asthma exacerbations, but also act directly on local adaptive immune cells to suppress Th2-mediated asthmatic responses (Koch and Finotto, 2015). Indeed, type III IFNs may play an important anti-inflammatory role in autoimmune diseases, with a recent study finding that type III IFNs block and reverse collagen-induced arthritis via suppression of IL-1\u03b2-producing neutrophil infiltration, therefore blocking Th17 and \u03b3\u03b4 T cell responses (Blazek et al., 2015). Many of these emerging roles for the type III IFNs have been elucidated as a consequence of the recently generated IL-28R\u03b1 knockout mouse, and more physiological roles may be revealed as studies continue (Ank et al., 2008; Egli et al., 2014).",

The SNPs with the strongest associations were identified in the novel IFN\u03bb4 gene.

However, why expression of IFN\u03bb4, and strong IFN\u03bb4 induced antiviral activity, is a disadvantage in HCV infection is unknown (Hamming et al., 2013; Terczy\u0144ska-Dyla et al., 2014).",

Thus, despite only subtle differences detected between type I and the type III IFN system tested in vitro, there may be major differences in vivo, possibly due to differences in the regulation of signaling cascades activated in vivo.

Despite the side effects associated with the off-target effects of these IFNs, they are still the main therapy for treating many diseases. However, the IFN family has greatly expanded in the past decade, and although some of these novel members have been significantly characterized, there is still much unknown about some of the newer IFNs. So, what do these new IFNs add to our knowledge and perception of the IFN family of cytokines and their roles in physiological and pathological processes? What is clear from recent characterizations of the type III IFN family and IFN\u03b5 is that these novel IFNs play important functional roles, not only in immune functions, but in normal homeostasis. The clinical relevance of newer IFN research is apparent from the recent example of how further understanding of type III IFNs, especially SNPs in these genes, has changed the way HCV is treated clinically. Indeed, the strong link between SNPs in type III IFN genes and viral infection highlights the possibility that uncharacterized SNPs in other novel IFNs may have potent functional consequences on the immune response and may underlie other human disease pathologies or therapeutic responses. Another exciting aspect of many of these novel IFNs is that although they may exhibit similar functions to the traditional IFNs, they are often produced in a more specialized manner, with some even being expressed constitutively at low levels within some organs. Their signaling occurs through well-characterized receptors, but there may be differences in these signal transduction pathways that are yet to be characterized. This research raises the possibility that the use of some of these novel IFNs therapeutically may be able to harness the wide range of beneficial effects induced by traditional IFNs, while overcoming issues of tolerance and side effects.",
