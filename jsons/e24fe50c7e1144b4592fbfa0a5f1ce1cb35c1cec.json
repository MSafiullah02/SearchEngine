Here, we purified the RABV virions with good purity and integrity, and analyzed their proteome by nano LC-MS/MS, followed by the confirmation with immunoblot and immuno-electronic microscopy. In addition to the 5 viral proteins, 49 cellular proteins were reproducibly identified to be incorporated into matured RABV virions. Function annotation suggested that 24 of them were likely involved in virus replication. Furthermore, cryo-EM was employed to observe the purified RABV virions, generating high-resolution pictures of the bullet-shaped virion structure of RABV.

Although rabies can be prevented by appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) administration, more than 59,000 people die of this incurable disease annually in the world (Brunker and Mollentze 2018) , emerging the significant demand to further investigate the mechanism of RABV life cycle and develop efficient therapeutics. RABV has a non-segmented, single stranded negative RNA genome of about 12 kb, encoding five viral proteins including nucleoprotein (N), matrix protein (M), phosphoprotein (P), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) and glycoprotein (G) (Davis et al. 2015) . To facilitate the efficient infection and replication, RABV has developed multiple strategies including interaction with host proteins to gain essential functions in viral replicative cycle. An example is that the heat shock proteins 70 (HSP70) was shown to interact with the N protein of RABV and to be present in both the nucleocapsid and purified virions, while down regulation of HSP70, using an inhibitor or RNA interference, results in a significant decrease in the production of viral mRNAs, viral proteins, and virions (Lahaye et al. 2012) .

Although the number of host proteins identified in two studies was almost the same, their proteomic compositions were distinct. To understand the proteomic composition of pathogenic RABV virions infecting nervous cells the present study was conducted, resulting in identification of 49 cellular proteins incorporated into CVS-11 with 11 of them validated by Western blotting or immuno-electron microscopy. Of 49 cellular proteins identified in CVS-11 virions purified from infected N2a cells only 13 were identified in SRV9 virions purified from infected BHK-21 cells, which mainly included 4 cytoskeleton-related proteins (Cofilin-1,GAPDH, Tubulin b-5, b-actin) and 4 virus replication associated proteins (HSC70, ARF3, CyPA, ENO1). The rest 36 proteins were not identified in SRV9 virions. It is interesting to note that ESCRT proteins associated with viral budding identified on CVS-11 virions were not found on SRV9 virions. This suggests that pathogenic and avirulent vaccine RABVs likely incorporate distinct cellular proteins into their virions during budding and release from host cells. Among the identified cellular proteins in CVS-11 virions, HSC70 and cofilin-1 had previously been reported to be involved in RABV infection. HSC70 protein was reported to interact with RABV leader RNA (leRNA), with its expression level dynamically regulated by RABV infection: down-regulated at an early stage with gradual up-regulation (Zhang et al. 2017 ). Here we demonstrate that HSC70 was packaged inside the virions. Cofilin is known to play an essential role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics, and while its knockdown did not affect the expression of RABV proteins, virion release was inhibited (Zan et al. 2016) . RABV infection has been reported to upregulate the expression of phosphorylated cofilin to facilitate actin polymerization for virus budding (Zan et al. 2016 ). Here, we also identified the phosphorylation of cofilin in RABV-infected cells but the protein found on virions was not phosphorylated (data not shown), indicating that cofilin was likely de-phosphorylated when packed into the rabies virion during budding. In addition, PCBP1 was also identified as being incorporated into the rabies virion. PCBP1, an RNA-binding protein, has been reported to interact with the ORF57 gene of Kaposi's sarcomaassociated herpesvirus (KSHV), being involved in regulation of the expression of both cellular and viral genes through the activated internal ribosome entry site (IRES) (Nishimura et al. 2004) , however, its function in RABV infection remains unknown. A previous study showed that its highly conserved isoform, PCBP2 (90% aa identity with PCBP1), increased the stability of RABV glycoprotein mRNA through selective interaction with its 3 0 UTR (Palusa et al. 2012) . This suggests that PCBP1 incorporated into virions might act as a functional partner for gene expression and posttranscriptional regulation. Many enveloped viruses utilize the host ESCRT for budding from the plasma membrane of infected cells (Votteler and Sundquist 2013) . In this process viruses employ the ESCRT machinery by selectively using core consensus sequences PPxY, PS/TAP, YxxL and FPIV (in which x denotes any amino acid), of the virus-encoded late domain (L-domain), which results in recruitment of the proteins in ESCRT-I, ESCRT-II, ESCRT-III and VPS4 for viral budding and release (Chen and Lamb 2008) . In rabies virus, the M protein contains two L-domains, PPEY and YVPL, which are found in an overlapping fashion ( 35-PPEYVPL 41 ) near its N terminus. Site-directed The 49 cellular proteins correspond to 24 nodes (red, blue, and green) and 25 edges (gray) in PPI network, respectively. Three significant MCODEs are displayed on the map by coloring the corresponding nodes. mutagenesis has confirmed that the PPEY motif is essential for efficient release of rabies virions (Wirblich et al. 2008 ), but the cellular factors required for viral budding have yet to be determined. The PPPY motif has been reported to recruit TSG101 for the budding of Marburg VP40-induced virus-like particles its incorporation within (Urata et al. 2007 ). Likewise, our study has provided evidence for the incorporation of TSG101 into the rabies virion during budding (Fig. 3A) , presumably mediated via its binding to the PPEY motif of the M protein. In addition to TSG101, other downstream ESCRT members, VPS28 and VPS37 in ESCRT-I, CHMP2A and CHMP4B in ESCRT-III, and also VPS4B, have been found to be recruited into rabies virions ( Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table S1 ). Elsewhere, ESCRT-III proteins CHMP2A, CHMP4B and VPS4 have been reported associated with the budding of HIV, equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), and murine leukemia virus (Morita et al. 2011; Sandrin and Sundquist 2013; Bartusch and Prange 2016) . It is likely from our results, therefore, that these ESCRT proteins are also important for the effective budding and release of RABV. Another Ldomain, YxxL, is present as YVPL in RABV M protein, but its function is unknown; however, EIAV uses this motif (as YPDL) within the late assembly domain of the Gag p9 protein to recruit cellular protein ALIX (another rabies virion component) for its budding (Chen et al. 2005) . Furthermore, ALIX binding to CHMP4 can recruit downstream ESCRT-III subunits (e.g., CHMP2A) and form the CHMP complex by polymerization, compressing the neck of budding viruses to facilitate fission and membrane scission (McCullough et al. 2008; Johnson et al. 2018 ). In addition, it is known that the AAA-type ATPase VPS4 A/B recruited by ESCRT-III is essential for disassembly of ESCRT-III spirals and is also likely to provide energy (Adell et al. 2014) . Here, VPS4B was identified in the RABV virion (Fig. 3A) and its function merits further investigation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 173, "end": 189, "text": "(Tu et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1625, "end": 1643, "text": "(Zhang et al. 2017", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1887, "end": 1904, "text": "(Zan et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 2048, "end": 2064, "text": "(Zan et al. 2016", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 2679, "end": 2702, "text": "(Nishimura et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2954, "end": 2974, "text": "(Palusa et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 3219, "end": 3248, "text": "(Votteler and Sundquist 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 3574, "end": 3594, "text": "(Chen and Lamb 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 4069, "end": 4090, "text": "(Wirblich et al. 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 4310, "end": 4328, "text": "(Urata et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 4925, "end": 4945, "text": "(Morita et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 4946, "end": 4973, "text": "Sandrin and Sundquist 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 4974, "end": 4999, "text": "Bartusch and Prange 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 5403, "end": 5421, "text": "(Chen et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 5645, "end": 5669, "text": "(McCullough et al. 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 5670, "end": 5689, "text": "Johnson et al. 2018", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 5862, "end": 5881, "text": "(Adell et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 4444, "end": 4453, "text": "(Fig. 3A)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4713, "end": 4720, "text": "Fig. 3A", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4725, "end": 4747, "text": "Supplementary Table S1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 5930, "end": 5939, "text": "(Fig. 3A)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Based on the above analyses a process for RABV egress involving the ESCRT system is proposed in Fig. 6 .

Recruitment of ESCRT at the assembly sites is likely mediated by M protein by two pathways: (1) the PPEY motif recruiting TSG101, VPS28, VPS37 (ESCRT-I); and (2) the YVPL motif recruiting ALIX. Downstream CHMP2A and CHMP4B (ESCRT-III) would then be recruited to form the budding neck by polymerization of the ESCRT-III proteins (Shen et al. 2014) .
