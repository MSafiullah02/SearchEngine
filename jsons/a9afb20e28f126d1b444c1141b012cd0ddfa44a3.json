This defi nition is important, as it differentiates patients with ALF from patients who suffer from liver failure owing to end-stage chronic liver disease [ 1 ] . Clinically, patients present with severe liver failure (icterus and coagulation failure, as refl ected by an international normalized ration (INR) \u22651.5) and hepatic encephalopathy. The time between the fi rst symptoms and the manifestation of hepatic encephalopathy has been shown to affect prognosis of these patients. Therefore several groups have included in their defi nition the time frame between the onset of symptoms and start of encephalopathy. The defi nition of the US ALF study group uses the term ALF as an umbrella and differentiates between three subgroups: hyperacute, acute, and subacute. The time between fi rst symptoms and encephalopathy in hyperacute ALF is 7 days, in acute ALF it is 8-28 days, and in subacute ALF it is 5-26 weeks [ 2 -4 ] (Fig. 25.1 ). More generally, ALF can be defi ned as a severe liver injury, clinically characterized by coagulopathy and hepatic encephalopathy within 26 weeks of symptom onset in previously healthy subjects [ 5 ] . Owing to loss of hepatic function, ALF results in hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and multiorgan failure within a short period of time.",

However, at the time of clinical presentation, in most cases a common fi nal stage has been reached in ALF patients. At this stage, three main factors seem important in determining prognosis: (1) the metabolic consequences resulting from the loss of liver cell mass, (2) the release of mediators and toxic metabolites from liver tissue, and (3) the capacity of the remaining vital hepatocytes to restore liver mass [ 3 , 7 ] . Therefore in terms of the mechanisms that are important during ALF, two different phases of ALF can be differentiated: the mechanisms that initially trigger liver failure and those that eventually determine outcome. Etiology of ALF and coma grade on admission are two prominent factors infl uencing prognosis. ALF due to acetaminophen toxicity, hepatitis A, ischemia, and pregnancy are associated with at least 60 % short-term transplant-free survival, whereas drug-induced liver injury, hepatitis B, autoimmune hepatitis, and indeterminate causes are associated with a spontaneous recovery rate of only 30 % [ 8 ] . Patients presenting with early grades of hepatic encephalopathy in ALF (independent of etiology) have usually a more favorable outcome than those with established stupor or coma [ 9 ] . Liver transplantation, intensive care medicine, and specifi c therapeutic options [ 10 ] (Table 25. 2 ) can improve prognosis.",

Additionally, glutamate transporter on astrocytes (GLT-1 and GLAST) and neurons (EAAC1) limit the expression of glutamate in the neuronal cleft. After uptake of glutamate in astrocytes via GLT-1, it is transformed into glutamine. Ammonia downregulates GLT-1 expression on astrocytes, and this results in higher and prolonged extracellular glutamate concentrations in patients with ALF.

The sites of the body with the most common infections are the lung, the urinary tract, and the blood (Fig. 25 .5 ). If antibiotic or antifungal treatment is necessary in these patients, the potential of further liver injury caused by antibiotic drugs should be considered. Besides the increased risk of patients being managed in ICU, additional factors contribute to the higher risk of infections in patients with ALF, namely, defects in the immunological defense mechanisms (complement, Kupffer cell function, polymorphonuclear cell function, cell-mediated immune response). The liver is the main source of complement (e.g., C3 and C5) production. As a consequence of lower complement levels, activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and complement-mediated opsonization is reduced. Therefore phagocytosis and killing of polymorphonuclear cells is inhibited in patients with ALF. Through the portal circulation, bacterial toxins are regularly brought to the liver tissue that is cleared by the resident Kupffer cells of the liver. In ALF there is a correlation between hepatic damage and Kupffer cell dysfunction. Additionally, Kupffer cells are a major source of cytokines, and their dysregulation also contributes to the impaired immune response. Defective lymphocyte function has been attributed to impaired interleukin-2 (IL-2) production in these patients. Thus the defect in immune response can be explained on different levels of the immune system [ 6 , 69 ] .",

Additionally, massive ATP depletion, formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), activation of non-apoptotic proteases, and strongly increased intracellular calcium concentrations-aggravating ATP deficiency by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential-contribute to necrosis.

Owing to the diminished liver function, higher rates of infections and coagulation disorders are observed. Cerebral edema, infections, and renal failure are important clinical complications limiting survival. For risk stratifi cation in patients with ALF and subsequent hepatic encephalopathy, serum ammonia levels can be used. Advanced cerebral dysfunction is expected at serum ammonia levels of 124 \u03bcmol/L or higher. Cardiovascular dysfunction is characterized by peripheral vasodilatation that results in relative hypovolemia, hypotension, and high output failure. Capillary leakage and high-volume therapy can lead to an ARDS-like syndrome and cause hypoxic complications. Prothrombin time is a useful parameter to assess the extent of remaining liver function.",

Severe liver injury leads to oxidative stress and depletion of ATP stores favoring necrosis, whereas suffi cient cellular ATP resources are required for the execution of apoptosis. As necrosis is associated with an inferior outcome as compared with apoptotic cell death, the discrimination of the cell death mode in ALF might be a novel prognostic tool for instant identifi cation of patients requiring transplantation. Moreover, the molecular cell death mechanisms in ALF are promising targets for future research aiming at reducing hepatocellular death without inhibiting liver regeneration.",
