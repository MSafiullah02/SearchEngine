The MDG 7, to ensure environmental sustainability, has the target 7C, which states \u2018halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation\u2019. Indicators for this target are the proportion of the population using an improved drinking water source and the proportion of the population using an improved sanitation facility (United Nations Children\u2019s Fund 2006). Many villages in Kompong Thom province of Cambodia are on track to meet this target; households have installed protected wells and improved latrines. The presence of the household improved latrine is a proxy indicator for basic sanitation in the household. The improved latrine represents a barrier to the environmental transmission of pathogens and is more likely to be sanitary than unimproved latrines or the absence of a latrine (United Nations Childrens Fund 2006).",

A household that has met the MDG metrics in a developing country by having an improved latrine may have different concentrations of microbes than a household in an industrialized country. This study quantifies microbial contamination on surfaces (fomites) in rural Cambodian homes that possess improved latrines as the UN MDG hygiene indicator and the single barrier for environmental transmission of pathogens. This paper tallies the microbes in Cambodian homes in reference to comparable surfaces in the United States and Japan (Rusin et al. 1998; Ojima et al. 2002).",

            "text": "Fomites in households have been found to contribute to the transmission of human pathogens (Reynolds et al. 2005). Because many microbes are capable of causing infections at low doses (Sinclair et al. 2008), pathogens can survive for hours to weeks on surfaces such as cutting boards and bathroom floors. Fomites have been proposed as a significant transmission route for outbreaks such as the SARS virus, which is known to survive up to 96 h (Duan et al. 2003) or longer on surfaces with moisture and biological substances. They are also believed to play a significant role in the transmission of other respiratory and enteric infections (Boone and Gerba 2007) and foodborne illness in the home (Scott 1996). Households in Kompong Thom province, Cambodia, were monitored for the numbers of faecal coliforms (i.e. thermotolerant coliforms), total coliforms and heterotrophic plate count (HPC) bacteria on the surfaces outlined in a similar USA\u2010based study (Rusin et al. 1998). The objectives of the study were to (i) assess kitchen and bathroom surface contamination to provide information regarding the areas of greatest potential exposure and public health risk in a developing country household, (ii) establish a baseline data set to be used for a later public health hand\u2010washing intervention and (iii) determine whether surfaces in rural Cambodian homes with \u2018improved sanitation\u2019 have similar contamination levels to homes in other countries. Such information could be used in a health education programme to aid in educational efforts focusing on hand washing, use of household disinfectants or other hygiene and sanitation practices.",

The above\u2010mentioned criteria one through three were established for comparison purposes with the Rusin study (Rusin et al. 1998).

Positive E. coli were identified by a blue colony with the formation of gas. Red colonies with gas were identified as total coliform. Red or blue colonies without gas were not counted. The HPC Petrifilm media followed a similar protocol, but were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 3 days. For faecal coliforms, a me mbrane\u2010filter faecal coliform (MFC) agar (Difco) was prepared and poured onto plastic Petri dishes. A spot plate method was used (Miles and Misra 1938), where a volume of 50 \u03bcl was placed as a drop on the solid agar and allowed to dry into the agar. Up to four spots per dilution were applied to the plates. Each sample was replicated in at least triplicate using Petrifilm and up to four replicates for spot plates.

The rudimentary kitchen consists of some large plastic basins for washing dishes, a wooden table for arranging food, a charcoal stove, some plastic containers for vegetables, a cutting board and a plastic rack with eating utensils. All kitchen areas are smoky and dark with no natural light.

Through a subsidy programme with the NGO ADRA, all houses had a pour\u2010flush latrine built from cement or a cement\u2013wood combination (Fig. 1). These were white ceramic pour\u2010flush latrines, which are most suitable where people use water for anal cleansing and squat to defecate. These latrines were built with a cement septic tank and PVC plumbing. The septic tank was built from circular cement rings, which are also used to line wells. Three of the eight houses had a separate wash or bathing room next to the room with the pour\u2010flush latrine. In four of the eight houses, children were seen going in and out of the latrine, indicating regular use by the household. Five latrines had a pair of sandals near the doorstep for use while using the latrine. Latrines and bathrooms were kept relatively clean, but no soap or other cleaning material was seen with the exception of powdered laundry detergent at one house. Dishes are washed with plastic scrub brush in large plastic basins with water, which was obtained from the onsite well. The dishes are then air\u2010dried on a rack and sometimes wiped with a rag designated for the kitchen. There was a plastic ladle cup, which is used to transfer water to the dish washing basins. This cup was reported to be a multitasking tool, where it is used to wash dishes, wash clothes, prepare food and occasionally used as a cup for drinking water. Soap was seen in only one of the houses and was a powdered laundry detergent. This type of soap is used for washing laundry, dishes and hands. No bar soap or other form was seen. Bathing and showers occasionally take place in the built bathroom located outside of the house, but more commonly using a bucket while standing next to their household well and wearing the traditional Kramah sarong. Although no pets were reported, many pigs, chickens, stray dogs and cats were seen in the all of the house yards.",

The England household investigation found enterobacteria common at wet sites and rare at dry sites. Salmonella was also common and high numbers of E. coli were found on the kitchen sink surfaces, suggestive of active bacterial growth (Scott et al. 1982). The England study found frequent contamination of dishcloths and other wet cleaning utensils. Authors of the England study suggested that these cleaning items might be reservoirs and also disseminators of contamination in the kitchen. As discussed previously, the US study also found that the kitchen is the most contaminated site with the toilet seat being the least contaminated (Rusin et al. 1998).",

            "text": "A complete sanitation and hygiene improvement programme should consider multiple control points (barriers) for environmental pathogens living on food, water, hands, fomites or in the air. This multiple barrier system is detailed in a discussion of the environmental infection transmission system model (Li et al. 2009), which considers physical proximity, microbe pick\u2010up rate, pathogen elimination rate, deposition rate and social encounters. A complete hygiene intervention focusing on the control of these sources of contamination is rare, while a single pathway model is much more common (Eisenberg et al. 2007). The Cambodian village homes in this study were selected because they use a pour\u2010flush latrine as a single barrier for environmental pathogen transmission. Results from this study demonstrate that a single barrier is not effective for household sanitation. When compared to the eight homes in Cambodia, homes in industrialized countries (i.e. United States and Japan) have additional environmental barriers that may control fomite contamination. The most effective barriers are thought to be the chlorinated water distribution system, a solid waste disposal system, a more elaborate home construction with easily washable surfaces and cleaning product availability. In addition, homes in these countries have indoor climate control systems and lower relative indoor humidity than tropical Cambodia.",

Further studies in Cambodia could combine the protein and biochemical marker investigations as described by Reynolds (Reynolds et al. 2005) with a full\u2010scale investigation into household hygiene including subtopics on solid waste, surface disinfection and fomite contamination. Additional studies should investigate these topics among households in varying socio\u2010economic classes, varying house construction types and the different types of well and latrine designs as defined by UNICEF (United Nations Children\u2019s Fund 2006).",
