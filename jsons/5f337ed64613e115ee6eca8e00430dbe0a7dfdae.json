Infections are manifest most commonly as explosive outbreaks of acute respiratory disease with fever, anorexia and weight loss, lethargy, nasal and ocular discharge, coughing and dyspnea [23] . It has been estimated that the clinical signs of influenza in pigs add 2 weeks to the time that it takes animals to reach market weight (B.C. Easterday, pers. comm.) . Therefore, swine influenza may be a substantial economic concern for farmers, and there is growing concern for the impact of synergistic infections with influenza and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome viruses [29, 40, 78] .",

            "text": "From a public health perspective, influenza virus infections in pigs pose two threats. It is well documented that classical H1N1 swine influenza viruses are zoonotic pathogens. Human infections with swine influenza viruses have been documented in the U.S. [19, 31, 82] , Europe [20] and New Zealand [22] , including fatal infections [22, 41, 57, 63, 70, 75, 81] . On a broader scale, pigs are susceptible to infection with influenza viruses of both avian and mammalian origin because their tracheal epithelium contains virus receptor sialyloligosaccharides with both 2,3-(preferred by avian influenza viruses) and 2,6-(preferred by mammalian influenza viruses) N-acetylneuraminic acid-galactose linkages [36] . As such, they have been implicated as the intermediate host for adaptation of avian influenza viruses to mammals [12] and as the \"mixing vessels\" in which humanavian influenza virus reassortment occurs [64, 65, 80] . The major pandemics of human influenza this century were caused by viruses that were reassortants between pre-existing human and avian viruses [80] . More recently, human-avian influenza virus reassortants have been isolated from commercially-raised pigs in Europe [14] and subsequently from children in the Netherlands [17] . Furthermore, maintenance of older human influenza virus strains in the pig population [3, 39, 49, 51, 54] may allow for re-introduction of antigenic variants back into the human population, and swine influenza viruses may also be transmitted into domestic turkey and wild bird populations [32, 33, 46] .",

In contrast, serologic evidence of H3 influenza virus exposure was remarkably lower in both studies (1.4% in 1976/1977 and 1.1% in 1988/1989 ). In 1988/1989, sera were also tested for antibodies to an avian virus, A/Duck/Alberta/16/87, but none of the 2,337 samples tested contained detectable antibodies to this virus.",

Nonetheless, variant H1 viruses have been isolated subsequently from pigs in North America and influenza viruses of other subtypes have been isolated from pigs in Europe and Asia. An H1N1 swine influenza virus with an antigenically and genetically unique hemagglutinin (HA) was isolated in Nebraska in 1992 [53] and a novel H1N1 influenza virus was associated with atypical proliferative and necrotizing pneumonia among pigs in Quebec in 1991 [21, 60] . Outside of North America, avian-like H1N1 viruses became the predominant influenza virus among pigs on the European continent [58, 66] and avian H1 viruses were also isolated from pigs in the United Kingdom [7, 10] and Asia [30] . A variety of reassortant influenza viruses have also been isolated from pigs. Reassortant H1N2 viruses were isolated from pigs in France in 1987 and 1988 [28] , in Japan in 1978 [52] and 1989/1990 [55] , and in the United Kingdom since 1994 [6, 8] . In addition, an H1N7 virus containing an HA gene most closely related to human H1 viruses and an NA gene most similar to equine N7 viruses was isolated from pigs in the United Kingdom in 1992 [9] , and human/swine H3N2 reassortant viruses have been isolated in southern China [69] .",

In this paper, we report the results of a year-long (September 1997-August 1998) virologic and serologic evaluation of influenza virus infections among pigs in the north-central United States. We specifically addressed the hypotheses that antigenic variants of swine H1N1 influenza viruses were circulating among pigs in the United States and that pigs in the United States were being exposed to human H3 and avian influenza viruses to a greater degree than in the past.",

One thousand two hundred samples (50 samples approximately every 2 weeks) were collected from pigs at the time of slaughter at a commercial abattoir. Samples of nasal secretions were collected from these same pigs at slaughter for virus isolation. Dacron swabs were inserted into the nasal passages of the pigs immediately after stunning, but before exsanguination. Swabs were placed in viral transport media (50% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] containing 1000 units Penicillin G, 200 g streptomycin, 50 units nystatin and 40 g gentamicin per ml) and maintained at 4 \u2022 C overnight until inoculated into eggs for virus isolation.

Data concerning the nature of influenza viruses circulating among pigs may, therefore, provide important sentinel information in surveillance for novel strains of influenza viruses in the human population. Additionally, regular and continual antigenic and genetic characterization of swine influenza viruses will help the veterinary community determine when it is necessary to update swine influenza virus vaccines with contemporary antigenic variant strains. Effective vaccination of pigs against influenza virus infection will reduce both morbidity among pigs and the potential for pigs to serve as a reservoir of influenza viruses for humans.",

The 26 influenza viruses isolated from pigs at slaughter were all H1N1 viruses. This is consistent with previous virologic and serologic data [16, 31] indicating that H1N1 viruses have been the predominant influenza viruses among pigs in the United States for many years. Antigenic differences in the HA proteins of these viruses compared to the classical swine H1 influenza reference strain, Sw/IND, were detected by Mab analysis. In fact, none of the viruses isolated during this study matched the Mab profile of Sw/IND (Table 2) . Currently, however, this level of antigenic drift is unlikely to impact the efficacy of the swine influenza virus vaccine that is available in the United States, since all of the viruses reacted with post-vaccinal pig sera to the same titer as the reference swine H1 virus, Sw/IND.",

The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were compared to reference swine, human and avian H1 influenza viruses to determine their percents identity, and the nucleotide sequences were subjected to phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 2) . These results indicate that the HA genes of the viruses isolated during this study are clearly from the classical swine H1 influenza virus lineage (Fig. 2) . Additionally, the HA gene sequences were analyzed for mutations in potential glycosylation sites. Only a single glycosylation change was identified: mutations in isolates 125 and 136 at amino acid 306 (S>N) alter the motif (N\u223cP-S/T\u223cP) for glycosylation at amino acid 304. Finally, the HA sequences were examined for mutations in specific amino acids previously defined as comprising the antigenic sites on the H1 HA [15, 45, 48, 53, 59, 83] . By doing so, the possible genetic bases for some of the antigenic variability observed in the HI assays could be determined. For example, mutation at amino acid 138 can explain the reduced reactivity of isolates 125 and 136 with Mab 7B1b (antigenic site Sa), mutation at amino acid 156 can explain the reduced reactivity of isolates 458 and 464 with Mab 2-15F1 (antigenic site Ca) and mutation at amino acid 142 can explain the lack of reactivity of isolate 164 with Mab 1-6B2 (antigenic site Sa). However, there are no mutations in or topographically near previously defined antigenic sites to explain the other altered Mab reactivity patterns noted. Sequencing of additional H1 isolates in the future and comparison to the sequences reported here may help to further define the amino acid residues that directly or indirectly contribute to each of these Mab epitopes.",

Given a 27.7% seropositivity rate against Sw/IND, it is clear that classical swine H1 influenza viruses continue to circulate widely within the pig population of the north-central United States. It is likely that the vast majority of these seropositive pigs had antibodies because of previous infection rather than vaccination. Vaccination of pigs against H1 influenza virus infection is practiced in the United States, with approximately 9 million doses of vaccine sold nationwide in 1998 (J. McMillen, pers. comm.). However, only about 40% of this vaccine is used in slaughter pigs, the remainder being used in breeding animals (R. Sibbel, pers. comm.). In 1997 [76] and 1998 [77] , 92 and 101 million pigs, respectively, went to slaughter in the United States. Therefore, if animals received the recommended 2 doses/animal, and assuming relatively uniform vaccine usage throughout the country, at most only 1.8-2.0% of slaughtered animals would be expected to be seropositive because of vaccination.",

            "text": "Our finding of 7.6% and 8.0% seropositivity rates against avian H1 and human H3 viruses, respectively, indicates that pigs in the north-central United States were exposed to these types of viruses in 1997-1998 to a substantially greater degree than was documented in 1976-1977 [31] and 1988-1989 [16] . The fact that seropositivity to these viruses was detected throughout the year (Fig. 4) and that seropositive samples were obtained from both the slaughterhouse and State Laboratory sample populations (data not shown) indicates that these overall levels of seropositivity cannot be explained by a large-scale outbreak on a single farm. In addition, several factors strongly indicate that seropositivity against the avian and human influenza viruses reflects actual infection of pigs with these virus types, and not simply cross-reactivity in the HI assays with classical swine viruses. First of all, although some serum samples had antibodies against either Dk/ALB or A/WUH and Sw/IND, suggestive of dual infections during a pig's lifetime, many samples reacted only with the avian or human viruses. Specifically, 12% of the sera with antibodies to Dk/ALB and 65% of the samples with antibodies to A/WUH tested negative for antibodies to Sw/IND. Furthermore, these sera that tested positive to Dk/ALB or A/WUH and not to Sw/IND also failed to react in HI assays with representative viruses from each of the groups ( Table 2 ) of recent antigenic variant swine H1 viruses [data not shown]. And conversely, sera from pigs that had been experimentally infected with Sw/IND during a previous experiment [42] were tested and completely lacked cross-reactivity in H1 assays with Dk/ALB and A/WUH. Specifically, swine sera with HI titers of 1:128 to 1:512 against Sw/IND had no detectable reactivity (<1:8) with either Dk/ALB or A/WUH.",

            "text": "The finding that 8.0% of the pigs in our study population tested positive serologically to human H3 influenza virus during late 1997 and 1998 is of particular significance. H3-subtype influenza viruses have been detected regularly among pigs in Asia and Europe [12, 13, 49, 51, 54] , but infection of pigs in the United States with this subtype has been quite rare in the past. Only 1.4% and 1.1% of pigs in the United States had antibodies to H3 influenza viruses in studies conducted in 1976-1977 [31] and 1988-1989 [16] , respectively, and only a single H3 isolate had been reported from pigs in the United States prior to 1998 [31] . However, this pattern changed dramatically in 1998. Although we did not isolate any H3 viruses from our slaughterhouse samples, we did isolate H3N2 viruses from pigs on farms in Nebraska, Iowa and Minnesota beginning in March, 1998 [38] , and Zhou and colleagues characterized additional viruses from North Carolina, Texas, Iowa and Minnesota [84] . Genetic analyses of these viruses indicated that their HA and neuraminidase genes were of human influenza virus origin, while the internal genes were either all of swine virus origin or were a mixture of swine and avian virus genes [38, 84] . We cannot determine from our data whether the H3 seropositivity that we observed in 1997-1998 reflects infection of pigs with these reassortant viruses or infection with wholly human H3 viruses that are likely to have entered the swine population prior to development of the reassortant viruses. Given the current presence of multiple subtypes of influenza viruses among American pigs, the potential exists for the emergence of additional reassortant viruses in this population in the future. Therefore, regular and frequent surveillance of swine influenza viruses should continue as part of an overall approach to the prevention of swine influenza epizootics and human influenza pandemics.",

Phylogenetic tree of the HA gene nucleotide sequences of 11 H1N1 influenza viruses isolated from pigs in the north-central United States, September 1997 to August 1998, compared to selected swine, human and avian reference strains. The tree was generated by the method of maximum parsimony (PAUP, Version 4.0b2, Dr. David Swofford, Smithsonian Institution), using the tree-bisection-reconnection branch swapping algorithm and with the MULTREES option in effect.
