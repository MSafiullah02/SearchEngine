Specifically, our method is able to produce stable and accurate forecasts 2 days ahead of current time, and uses as inputs (a) official health reports from Chinese Center Disease for Control and Prevention (China CDC), (b) COVID-19-related internet search activity from Baidu, (c) news media activity reported by Media Cloud, and (d) daily forecasts of COVID-19 activity from GLEAM, an agent-based mechanistic model. Our machine-learning methodology uses a clustering technique that enables the exploitation of geo-spatial synchronicities of COVID-19 activity across Chinese provinces, and a data augmentation technique to deal with the small number of historical disease activity observations, characteristic of emerging outbreaks. Our model's predictive power outperforms a collection of baseline models 1 arXiv:2004.04019v1 [stat.OT] 8 Apr 2020 in 27 out of the 32 Chinese provinces, and could be easily extended to other geographies currently affected by the COVID-19 outbreak to help decision makers.",

Despite the fact that these methodologies have successfully addressed delays in the availability of health reports as well as case count data quality issues, developing predictive models for an emerging disease outbreak such as COVID-19 is an even more challenging task (14) . There are multiple reasons for this, for example, the availability of epidemiological information for this disease is scarce (there is no historical precedent about the behavior of the disease), the daily/weekly epidemiological reports that become available are frequently revised and corrected retrospectively to account for mistakes in data collection and reporting (a common practice in public health reports), and the presence of a diverse array of uncertainties about disease burden due in part to underreporting of cases (15) .",

Inspired by a methodology previously used to successfully forecast seasonal influenza in the United States at the state level (11) and previous methods to monitor emerging outbreaks (19, 20) , Augmented ARGONet is capable of reliably forecasting COVID-19 activity even when limited historical disease activity observations are available. From a methodological perspective, the novelty in our approach comes from a clustering technique that enables the exploitation of geo-spatial synchronicities of COVID-19's activity across Chinese provinces, and a data augmentation technique to mitigate the scarcity of historical data for model-training.",

The forecasting (case aggregation) time horizon of our predictions was chosen to be 2 days to enhance the signal to noise ratio. Based on geo-spatial synchronicities in COVID-19 activity in each province during the (dynamically increasing) training period, groups of Chinese provinces were clustered, every two days, to train a separate machine learning model per cluster to produce predictions. COVID-19 historical information from official health reports, Baidu search engine frequencies, news reports from Media Cloud, and mechanistic model estimates were then included into separate datasets for each cluster of provinces. Additionally, a data augmentation procedure aimed at increasing the size of each cluster's training dataset was implemented to deal with the scarce number of observations during this relatively-short (local) outbreak. A visual representation of our out-of-sample model forecasts is shown in Figure 1 along with the subsequently observed COVID-19 cases, as reported by China CDC.",

To minimize the prediction errors in our estimates, the dynamic design of our methodology utilizes different sources of information as needed over time. This means that, for each province (or group of provinces within a cluster), we can quantify the predictive power of different features used in our models as time evolves. Our analysis, visualized in Figure 4 , shows that historical COVID-19 confirmed cases, and suspected cases were consistently relevant sources of information over most of the study period. Internet-based search terms from Baidu were also frequently used. Daily news counts were used by our models in a selected number of provinces. However, for many of these provinces, the importance of media article counts decrease over time. Estimates from mechanistic models contributed to our model prediction, especially in early February, 2020. To facilitate comparison between model scores in each province in terms of RMSE, we normalized the RMSE score of each model by the baseline's RMSE and visualized its inverse value. In this way, scores above 1 imply an improvement (RMSE reduction), whereas score below 1 imply the model had a bigger RMSE in comparison to the baseline. In the case of correlation, we plotted the difference between the absolute values between each model's correlation and the baseline. Each panel is ordered, from left to right, based on the metric performance of Augmented ARGONet (solid red).

In this study, we only used unrevised data, which is the real case scenario to produce real time estimates. The reports, available for all the provinces, include various activity trends such as: new diagnosed cases, new suspected cases, and new reported deaths.

In GLEAM, the world population is divided into sub-populations centered around major transportation hubs Removed individuals represent those who can no longer infect others, meaning they were isolated, hospitalized, died, or have recovered. The model produces an ensemble of possible epidemic scenarios described by the number of newly generated infections, times of disease arrival in each subpopulation, and the number of traveling infection carriers. We make an assumption that a starting date of the epidemic that falls between November, 15 2019 and December 1, 2019, with 40 cases IS caused by zoonotic exposure (33) (34) (35) (36) . The transmission dynamic is calibrated by using an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach to estimate the posterior distribution of the basic reproductive number R 0 (37).

If the pairwise correlation between the two provinces is high, it indicates that the trend in the percentage of people traveling from Wuhan to the two provinces are similar. We calculated the pairwise correlation matrix for new confirmed cases using data from February 1, 2020 to February 21, 2020, and we found that provinces which are geographically closed are not necessarily clustered together, indicating geographical distance would not be able to explain the similarity in the new confirmed cases. To further explore the potential impact of mobility on the new confirmed cases of each province, we then calculated the Pearson correlation and cosinus similarity between the two correlation matrices. To do this, we first converted the two matrices into two vectors and calculated the correlation between the two vectors. We got Pearson correlation of 0.1473 and cosinus similarity of 0.4729.

Ground mobility flows are derived by the analysis and modeling of data collected from the statistics offices for 30 countries on 5 continents (30). Mobility variations in Mainland China were adapted from information from Baidu Location-Based Services (LBS). Within each subpopulation, the human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 is modeled using a compartmental representation of the disease where each individual can occupy one of the following four states: Susceptible (S), Latent (L), Infectious (I) and Removed (R). Susceptible individuals can acquire the virus through contacts with individuals in the infectious state, and become latent, meaning they are infected but can not transmit the infection yet. Latent individuals progress to the infectious stage with a rate inversely proportional to the latent period. Infectious individuals progress into the removed stage with a rate inversely proportional to the infectious period. The sum of the average latent and infectious periods defines the generation time.",
