From the perspectives of both economic and animal welfare considerations, efficacious and practical means to reduce the burden of disease are long overdue. Most attention has focused on pneumonic pasteurellosis, commonly termed \u201cshipping fever,\u201d in recently weaned beef calves soon after entry to feedlots. Economic losses to the North American feedlot industry alone have been estimated at nearly $1 billion per year (Whiteley et al., 1992). This does not include losses due to enzootic pneumonia in veal, dairy, or beef calves before weaning. Both bacteria and viruses have been implicated in the disease processes, and vaccines have been marketed for over 80 years (Mosier et al., 1989). We have summarized the agents associated with respiratory disease in cattle and the vaccine preparations marketed for their control (Table 61.1). Mannheimia haemolytica is discussed in detail as an example of past, current, and future vaccine approaches.",

In experimental studies, it causes a fibrinous pneumonia comparable to that seen in cattle dying of pneumonic pasteurellosis (Friend et al., 1977; Shoo, 1989), and it is considered the most important bacterial pathogen in bovine pneumonias (Mosier, 1997). The first 7 decades of vaccine history have been reviewed by Mosier et al. (1989). As a single agent, this bacterium induces pneumonia in experimental studies, but most field cases of pneumonia involve predisposing factors of stress (sudden shifts in weather conditions, change of feed, weaning, and commingling with other cattle) and interactions with viral pathogens (reviewed by Yates [1982] and by Hodgins et al. [2002]). To be effective, vaccination strategies against respiratory disease in feedlot cattle will therefore need to induce immunity to multiple pathogens.",

Under ill-defined conditions of stress, M. haemolytica serotype A1 populations increase rapidly in the nasopharynx (Frank and Smith, 1983). Invasion of the lower respiratory tract, facilitated in many cases by viral effects on clearance mechanisms of the tracheal and bronchial mucosa, leads to vascular damage, exudation of fibrin, and necrosis of lung parenchymal tissue (lesions reviewed by Rehmtulla and Thomson [1981]). Morbidity rates of 15% to 45% and mortality rates of 1% to 5% are common among weaned calves arriving at feedlots (Kelly and Janzen, 1986).

Significant protection in experimental challenge studies has been reported for a number of these products (Conlon et al., 1991, 1995; Confer and Fulton, 1995). Investigations of vaccine efficacy are conducted almost exclusively in ruminants because the leukotoxin, the best documented of its virulence factors, is toxic only to ruminant leukocytes (Kaehler et al., 1980; Shewen and Wilkie, 1982). Efficacy in field trials can be considerably lower than in controlled experiments because of suboptimal timing of vaccination, variation in exposure to pathogens other than M. haemolytica, and variation in immunity to M. haemolytica in nonvaccinated control calves (Thorlakson et al., 1990).",

Conventional two-dose vaccination, with primary vaccination weeks before weaning, is labor intensive and increases stress for the calves. Delayed vaccination, with a single dose of vaccine at the time of feedlot arrival, can induce anamnestic responses in calves that have been primed by natural exposure (Conlon et al., 1995), but it does not allow sufficient time for na\u00efve (highly susceptible) calves to respond immunologically. One approach with merit is to vaccinate calves at about 3 months of age when they are being handled for branding (Harland et al., 1992), followed by a booster dose at weaning (6 to 8 months of age).",

These attributes discourage the use of plasmid DNA technology by itself for vaccination against M. haemolytica, since frequency of vaccination and labor costs are key issues. Further advances in plasmid design and delivery (Babiuk et al., 2002) or combination of plasmid vaccines with other vaccination approaches may make DNA vaccines feasible for use in cattle. Unmethylated CpG oligodeoxynucleotides have been investigated as potential adjuvants for veterinary vaccines (Rankin et al., 2001) and may find a role in conventional protein-based vaccines or plasmid DNA vaccines.",

For some complex disease conditions (e.g., pneumonic pasteurellosis in cattle) there is continuing uncertainty about whether all of the relevant contributing pathogens have been identified. Although many parenteral vaccines are efficacious in reducing lower respiratory tract disease, there is a need to investigate whether induction of mucosal immunity in the upper airways, in combination with systemic immunity, can further reduce infection rates, transmission of pathogens, and economic losses. Finally, there is a need to devise and implement changes in management procedures to reduce disease exposure (by nonimmunological methods) and to optimize immune interventions by improving the timing of vaccinations.",

After months of infection, the uterus is cleared first, followed by the vagina. Convalescent immunity is partially protective for a limited time. Antibody is effective in protection against this extracellular pathogen, as demonstrated by systemic passive immunization (Berg et al., 1979). The antibody response to infection is primarily IgA in the vagina and IgG in the uterus (Corbeil et al., 1981). Systemic immunization with a whole cell vaccine results in both IgG1 and IgG2 antibody responses to surface antigen in serum, uterine, and vaginal secretions (Corbeil et al., 1981). This response prevents infection and can rapidly clear infected cows (Corbeil and Winter, 1978). That is, the vaccine can be used prophylactically and therapeutically. Immunization is efficacious even though surface antigenic variation occurs in the face of a local immune response (Corbeil and Winter, 1978). Presumably, immune clearance occurs when the dynamic interaction between protection and evasion is shifted in favor of the host. This appears to occur earlier when the response is primarily IgG than when IgA predominates (Corbeil et al., 1981). This may be related to the ability of the IgG antibodies to mediate opsonization and intracellular killing of the bacterium, an ability that IgA antibodies lack (Corbeil and Winter, 1978). Although this work was done many years ago, it sets a precedent for systemic immunization for prophylaxis and therapy for reproductive mucosal infections.",

T. vaginalis causes a human STD also associated with adverse pregnancy outcome. Thus, bovine trichomoniasis serves as a model for immune prevention of a human reproductive mucosal infection. Because of the economic significance of bovine trichomoniasis and because no chemotherapy is used owing to toxicity, investigations have focused on immunoprophylaxis and therapy. Like C. fetus subsp. venerealis, T. foetus colonizes the vaginal and uterine or preputial surfaces for months. In fact, mature bulls are often infected for life, whereas young bulls may clear the infection with time. This is probably related to innate immunity. Trichomonads are anaerobic parasites and are found deep in uterine glands and epithelial crypts of the penis and prepuce (Rhyan et al., 1999), where the oxygen tension is probably lowest. In order to elucidate protective acquired immune responses, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with putative protective functions were chosen for immunoaffinity purification of a highly glycosylated surface antigen (Corbeil et al., 2001). Analysis of many isolates of T. foetus indicated that the two mAbs recognized different epitopes of the same antigen, which was conserved in all isolates tested. This glycosylated surface antigen was later shown to be a lipophosphoglycan (LPG)/protein complex. Systemic immunization with the immunoaffinity-purified surface antigen, followed by vaginal challenge with T. foetus, resulted in statistically significantly earlier clearance of the parasite from vaccinated animals than from controls (Corbeil et al., 2001). Even more important, clearance of immunized animals most often occurred before 7 weeks of infection. Mucosal convalescent immunity cleared controls much later. Others showed that significant inflammation accompanied by reproductive failure did not occur until after 7 weeks of infection, so the vaccine should protect against fetal loss (Parsonsen et al., 1976). Analysis of antibody responses demonstrated predominantly IgG1 responses in the serum and IgA plus IgG1 antibodies in secretions.",

This question is under investigation. Second, which is more protective: IgG or IgA antibody? And how can that Ig class be enriched to enhance protection? To address the latter questions, preliminary studies were done in mice to determine the best routes and adjuvants to enrich for IgG or IgA in genital secretions (Corbeil et al., 2001). Subcutaneous priming with the immunoaffinity purified surface antigen (called TF1.17 antigen) in Quil A adjuvant and subcutaneous boosting with whole cells enriched for IgG anti-TF1.17 antibodies, whereas subcutaneous priming and vaginal boosting greatly enriched for IgA antibodies in genital secretions. When cattle immunized by these two methods were challenged vaginally with T. foetus, those with predominantly IgA or predominantly IgG1 anti-TF1.17 antibodies in genital secretions were equally protected. Later studies with similar nasal immunizations showed that stimulation of the common mucosal immune system yielded results similar to those of vaginal immunization (Corbeil et al., 2001). This raised the question of inductive sites for local immune responses in the genital tract.",

This is true of cattle as well as mice and humans. However, even though control cows did not have histologically demonstrable MALT in the uterus and vagina, cows experimentally infected with T. foetus did (Corbeil et al., 2001). Similar lymphoid nodules and follicles under a modified epithelium were detected in preputial and penial surfaces of bulls infected with T. foetus (Rhyan et al., 1999). Immunostaining of parallel sections with mAb to TF1.17 antigen indicated uptake of antigen by epithelial cells and large macrophage or dendritic type cells under the basement membrane near the lymphoid follicles (Rhyan et al., 1999). Similar antigen uptake has been detected in the infected female uterine and vaginal mucosa (unpublished data, Rhyan, J.C., BonDurant, R.H., and Corbeil, L.B.). Thus, even though the parasite is noninvasive, released TF1.17 antigen appears to be taken up by epithelial cells. Rat uterine epithelial cells can present antigen to Th cells (Wira and Rossol, 1995). Also, macrophage/dendritic type cells positive for antigen should be antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Detection of IgG1 and IgA antibodies to TF1.17 antigen in genital secretions of infected animals (Rhyan et al., 1999) and cows (Corbeil et al., 2001) and the histologic demonstration of follicles and putative APCs suggest that inductive sites in the genital tract are formed in response to antigen.",

For antibody-mediated protection of the genital mucosa, several questions have not yet been addressed. As alluded to earlier, it is not clear how IgG crosses the mucosal epithelium into the secretions since it lacks secretory component and a polymeric Ig receptor-mediated type of transport. To our knowledge, the role of IgE in the genital tract has been largely unstudied. Last, manipulating genital immune responses to enhance Th1- or Th2-type responses is an unexplored research area. This should be important in protection against intracellular or extracellular pathogens. The use of DNA or recombinant vaccines including genes for appropriate cytokines may be an approach to meet this need.",

            "text": "Prevention of localized intestinal infections requires the presence of sufficient levels of antibodies at the site of pathogen attachment, replication, and invasion (gut lumen). The need to provide neonatal immunity against enteric pathogens prompted studies of maternal vaccines to enhance passive lactogenic immunity (maternal antibodies in colostrum and milk). The notion that live oral vaccines could mimic natural routes of infection and were preferable to conventional inactivated parenteral vaccines for stimulating protective lactogenic immunity (Bohl et al., 1972; Saif et al., 1972) was put forth over 30 years ago. Studies showed that in TGEV-seronegative sows, only oral immunization with virulent TGEV induced high rates of protection in suckling neonates. Oral immunization with live TGEV induced high titers of S-IgA antibodies in colostrum and milk, whereas systemic immunization induced mainly IgG antibodies. The ability of sows to transmit a high degree of passive lactogenic immunity to their suckling progeny was more closely associated with S-IgA than IgG TGEV antibodies. Bohl and Saif were the first to elaborate the concept of a gut-mammary gland\u2013S-IgA immunologic axis, and these pioneering studies formed part of the basic tenet for a common mucosal immune system. Oral immunization of pregnant sows with attenuated TGEV and rotavirus vaccines is still used to induce passive immunity (Table 61.2). However, it was subsequently shown that in seropositive, naturally infected pregnant swine or cattle, lactogenic antibodies (S-IgA in swine and IgG1 in cattle) could also be enhanced by parenteral vaccination with live or appropriate killed or subunit vaccines (reviewed by Saif and Wesley, 1999; Saif and Fernandez, 1996). These observations concerning vaccine effects in TGEV-seronegative versus -seropositive animals explain some of the vaccine inconsistencies seen in field studies. Killed and modified live vaccines administered orally or parenterally to the mother are used extensively to increase lactogenic immunity in livestock and will be discussed further in the passive immunity section.",

Gnotobiotic pigs are free of maternal antibodies (placental transfer of Ig does not occur in swine), but they are immunocompetent at birth. They are maintained aseptically and free of exposure to extraneous rotaviruses, ensuring that exposure to a single pathogen can be analyzed. Initial studies were conducted to mimic natural rotavirus infection (Bohl et al., 1984) and to examine immune correlates of protection (Saif et al., 1997). Gnotobiotic pigs orally inoculated with virulent or attenuated porcine rotaviruses or human rotavirus (HRV) were completely protected from homotypic but not heterotypic (distinct P and G type) rotavirus challenge (Hoshino et al., 1988; Saif et al., 1997). Pigs inoculated with virulent HRV developed significantly higher numbers of virus-specific IgA and IgG antibody-forming cells (AFCs) and memory B cells and higher lymphocyte proliferative responses in the intestinal lamina propria than did pigs inoculated with attenuated HRV (Ward et al., 1996b; Yuan et al., 1996). Pigs inoculated with two or three doses of attenuated HRV were moderately protected against virus shedding and diarrhea after homotypic challenge, similar to results of clinical trials of oral attenuated rotavirus vaccines in infants (Bresee et al., 1999). The magnitude of the intestinal IgA AFC and lymphocyte proliferative responses correlated with the level of protection induced (Ward et al., 1996b; Yuan et al., 1996).",

Inactivated oral or intramuscular HRV vaccines failed to protect against virulent HRV challenge, despite high IgG antibody responses induced in serum and systemic lymphoid tissues by the intramuscular vaccine. Rotavirus subunit vaccines consisting of double-layered VLPs composed of rotavirus inner capsid proteins VP2 and VP6 (2/6-VLPs) administered nasally or orally with mutant heat-labile toxin of E. coli (mLT) or ISCOMs as adjuvants (Iosef et al., 2002; Yuan and Saif, 2002) induced IgG AFC responses in systemic lymphoid tissues and low or no IgA AFC responses in intestinal lymphoid tissues and also failed to mediate protection. The failure of intramuscularly administered inactivated HRV vaccines demonstrates that protective immunity against rotavirus requires the induction of IgA antibodies in the intestine, since systemic IgG antibodies alone were not effective.

The natural occurrence of a deletion mutant of TGEV with exclusive respiratory tropism, referred to as porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), provided a unique opportunity to study AFC responses and protective immunity to two antigenically related porcine coronaviruses with enteric (TGEV) versus respiratory (PRCV) tropism. The investigators showed that oral immunization of pigs with TGEV induced high numbers of IgA AFCs in the intestine and provided complete protection against TGEV challenge, whereas nasal immunization of pigs with PRCV induced mainly systemic immune responses (IgG AFCs) and provided only partial protection against TGEV challenge. Thus, the nasal PRCV alone failed to elicit sufficient intestinal IgA AFCs to provide full protection against the enteric pathogen, TGEV. Findings from this study, in addition to the studies of rotavirus vaccines, suggest that use of multiple mucosal inductive sites in a prime/boost vaccination regimen may be an effective approach to overcoming the compartmentalization in the common mucosal immune system.",

In 1982, it was demonstrated that pups with hemagglutination inhibition (HI) serum antibody titers of >1:80 were immune to oronasal CPV type 2 challenge (Pollock and Carmichael, 1982). CPV is highly stable in the environment, and pups became susceptible to infection as soon as maternal antibodies declined to HI titers of 1:64 to 1:80. A maternal HI antibody titer as low as 1:20 severely affected the efficacy of a live CPV vaccine, however (Carmichael et al., 1983).",

Such vaccines are practical and effective because (1) fimbriae are required for the adhesion-colonization of bacteria early in the pathogenesis of the disease; (2) most fatal ETEC infections in farm animals occur in the neonatal period; and (3) more than 90% of the ETEC strains in farm animals belong to a small family of fimbrial antigen types. Moreover, the vaccine strategy used to induce lactogenic immunity, parenteral vaccination of field-exposed seropositive mothers, is the same as that shown to be effective for parenteral application of rotavirus vaccines in rotavirus-seropositive mothers (Saif and Fernandez, 1996; Saif and Jackwood, 1990).",

However, only protection against infection, not against diarrhea, can be assessed in adult mouse or rabbit models, as these species are susceptible to rotavirus-induced diarrhea only during the first 2 weeks of life (Ciarlet et al., 1998; Ward et al., 1990). Studies in pigs indicate that protection rates against rotavirus diarrhea upon challenge correlate with the magnitude of IgA AFC and memory B cell responses in intestinal lymphoid tissues but not with such responses in systemic lymphoid tissues (Yuan and Saif, 2002). Thus, the capacity to induce sufficient levels of intestinal IgA AFCs or antibodies and sufficient memory B cell responses appears to be critical for the efficacy of rotavirus vaccines in large animals and likely in human infants (Coulson et al., 1992).",

In mice and rats, transplacental transfer of Ig occurs in combination with prolonged (16 and 21 days, respectively) postnatal transfer by means of colostrum and milk (Pastoret, 1998). In dogs and cats, transfer of IgG occurs by a combination of prenatal and postnatal mechanisms, with 5% to 10% of total transfer occurring before birth (Tizard, 2000). In ruminants, horses, and pigs, offspring are born virtually agammaglobulinemic, and transmission of Ig occurs only via colostrum for a limited time after birth (Pastoret, 1998; Wagstrom et al., 2000). After the transition from production of colostrum to milk, Ig are no longer absorbed from the intestines and act only locally.",

Failure of passive transfer is a common problem, however, in newborn calves and foals (Besser and Gay, 1994; Tyler-McGowan and Hodgson, 1997). Failure of passive transfer may occur because of the production of low quantities of colostrum, production of colostrum with inadequate levels of maternal antibodies (e.g., with mastitis or agalactia), ingestion of low quantities of colostrum, or inefficient absorption in the gut (Quigley and Drewry, 1998). Colostral supplements and replacers (Arthington et al., 2000; Quigley and Drewry, 1998) as well as plasma products have been developed commercially to address this problem, with variable success. Since transfer of maternal antibodies in farm animals is dependent upon ingestion of colostrum, the benefits of vaccination of the dam for enhancing passive immunity are lost if absorption of colostral Ig is inefficient (Hodgins and Shewen, 1994).",

Recent findings suggesting that the FcRn is involved in homeostasis of serum levels of IgG in general do not preclude distinct mechanisms functioning in neonates. Studies conducted by Besser et al. (1987, 1988b) indicate that the main route of clearance of passively acquired IgG1 in calves is transfer from the serum to the intestine. Approximately 70% of passively acquired IgG1 is eliminated by this route. If titers of passive circulating antibodies are high enough, the transfer of antibodies from the circulation to the intestinal lumen is sufficiently efficient to mediate at least short-term partial protection against rotavirus diarrhea (Besser et al., 1988a). The same mechanism may be functional in piglets (reviewed by Saif and Wesley, 1999; Parre\u00f1o et al., 1999; Ward et al., 1996a). The persistence of titers of circulating maternal antibodies is generally considered in the design of vaccination strategies for young animals because of suppressive effects of maternal antibodies on active immune responses. However, it is not always necessary to wait for titers of maternal antibodies to decline to the limit of detection before vaccination (Hodgins and Shewen, 1998), and in maternally immune piglets, induction of memory can occur even in the presence of detectable antibodies (Boersema et al., 1998).",

            "text": "Rodents have been a popular model for the study of passive protection by milk antibodies. However, rats and mice actively transport IgG from the gut into the circulation during the first 2 weeks of life. Thus, antibodies in ingested milk contribute to both local and systemic immunity in rodents, in contrast to the strictly local effects occurring in humans and most domestic animals. In pigs, horses, dogs, and cats, IgG is the most abundant Ig in colostrum, but IgA predominates in milk. Parenteral vaccination, by enhancing serum IgG antibody titers, contributes to IgG antibodies in colostrum but has limited effects on IgA antibodies in milk. Although Saif and Bohl (1983) and Salmon (1995) observed IgA antibody responses in sow's milk after the administration of live viruses into the mammary gland, this is not the usual mechanism for induction of IgA antibodies to enteric pathogens in milk of seronegative animals. Rather, in swine, Bohl and Saif (Bohl et al., 1972; Saif et al., 1972) showed that IgA antibodies in milk with specificity for enteric pathogens appear after sufficient antigenic stimulation (TGEV infection) of the intestine. On the basis of these observations, they first proposed trafficking of IgA lymphoblasts from the gut to the mammary gland in monogastrics. This proposed gut\u2013mammary\u2013S-IgA immunologic axis provided part of the initial basis for the concept of a common mucosal immune system. The trafficking of gut-origin IgA lymphoblasts to the mammary gland was confirmed experimentally in mice (Roux et al., 1977) and subsequently verified in swine (Salmon et al., 1984). In contrast, Sheldrake and Husband (1985) found little evidence of a gut\u2013mammary gland axis in ruminants. Instead, in ruminants, IgG1 is the main isotype in both colostrum and milk (Butler, 1983), and it is selectively transported from serum primarily prepartum, but also postpartum, with a marked decrease in serum IgG1 prepartum (Butler, 1983). An IgG1-specific Fc receptor, probably the FcRn (Kacskovics et al., 2000), expressed on the basolateral surface of mammary gland alveolar epithelial cells is responsible for this transport. It is interesting that both the expression of this IgG1 receptor in ruminants and the trafficking of IgA lymphoblasts to the mammary gland in monogastrics are regulated by pregnancy hormones (prolactin, estrogen, and progesterone) (Weisz-Carrington et al., 1978; Barrington et al., 2000).",

To control epidemic infections (such as epidemic TGEV), they are targeted for use in na\u00efve, seronegative animals to induce primary immune responses. To control endemic infections (such as with rotavirus and E. coli), booster vaccines are used in seropositive, field-exposed animals to stimulate anamnestic responses. Vaccine strategies for the latter vaccines generally have been more successful than for the former, reflecting a greater success in designing vaccines to boost rather than to prime for mucosal immunity to provide lactogenic immunity against enteric pathogens. To date, only virulent TGEV given to pregnant sows effectively stimulates high levels of IgA antibodies in milk and passive protection (reviewed by Saif and Jackwood, 1990; Saif and Wesley, 1999). Use of oral highly attenuated TGEV vaccines (safe for piglets but which replicate poorly in sows) induces lower IgA milk antibody titers and low or variable efficacy in the field (Moxley and Olsen, 1989). Parenteral killed TGEV vaccines induce only low milk IgG antibody titers and usually the lowest protection rates. Attempts to develop maternal TGEV recombinant subunit vaccines based on the surface TGEV spike (S) protein that induces neutralizing antibodies or live vector vaccines expressing the S protein have also been of limited success in TGEV-seronegative swine (reviewed by Saif and Wesley, 1999). However, prime/boost strategies such as intramuscular administration of TGEV S protein following oral/nasal priming with attenuated TGEV have shown promise as a means of enhancing milk IgA antibody titers (Park et al., 1998). Epidemic TGEV outbreaks have also declined following the appearance of a respiratory variant of TGEV. This variant induces TGEV-neutralizing antibodies in milk and at least moderate protection against TGEV after repeated respiratory infections in sows, raising unresolved questions about bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT)\u2013mammary gland lymphocyte trafficking (reviewed in Saif and Wesley, 1999).",

Booster vaccination strategies are required to enhance lactogenic immunity to such endemic enteric pathogens because antibody titers in milk decline dramatically during lactation. Although studies are limited, parenteral vaccination of TGEV- or rotavirus-seropositive (field-exposed) pregnant sows with attenuated vaccines effectively boosted both S-IgA and IgG antibodies in milk (Saif and Jackwood, 1990; Saif and Fernandez, 1996; Saif and Wesley, 1999). These findings concur with reports of increased breast milk IgA antibodies in women endemically exposed to cholera and parenterally boosted with a cholera vaccine (Svennerholm et al., 1977). The finding that parenteral boosting is effective in increasing IgA antibodies in mucosal secretions of animals orally primed with a live pathogen is consistent with observations that after intestinal replication of rotavirus in pigs, IgA memory B cells initially reside in the ileal Peyer's patches but are subsequently also present in substantial numbers in spleen but not bone marrow (Yuan et al., 2001). Thus, systemic stimulation of such IgA memory B cells by parenteral booster vaccines could yield IgA antibodies in serum for transport to mucosal secretions via the polymeric Ig receptor. These observations have led to mucosal prime/boost strategies for human and animal rotavirus vaccines that are currently being tested in gnotobiotic pigs (Yuan and Saif, 2002).",

Thus, vaccines are marketed for prepartum vaccination of cows against rotavirus, coronavirus, and E. coli to enhance passive immunity in their calves (Table 61.1), but the field efficacy of these viral vaccines has been questioned (Waltner-Toews et al., 1985). A number of important variables may account for vaccine failures. These include vaccine titer and dose, inactivating agent, virus strain, adjuvant, inoculation route, and parity of the mother (reviewed by Saif and Fernandez, 1996). Because colostrum and milk of ruminants contain mainly serum-derived IgG1, parenteral (intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intramammary) inoculation of rotavirus seropositive cows with optimal live, inactivated, or subunit (VP 2/4/6/7 VLP) rotavirus vaccines effectively boosts both IgG1 and virus-neutralizing antibody titers in serum and milk.",

Thus, vaccine efficacy is based on antibodies absorbed from colostrum or retained temporarily in the gut, rather than on a continuing supply of immune milk. Besser et al. (1988a) demonstrated that transfer of passive IgG1 antibodies from the serum to the intestine in calves could mediate this short-term protection. Piglets, in contrast, continue to receive immune milk until weaning at 2 to 3 weeks of age. The importance of a continuous supply of passive antibodies for protection against TGEV has been demonstrated experimentally (Saif and Wesley, 1999).",

A common strategy for vaccines of dogs and cats is to administer a series of doses of vaccine from an early age (at which only a few individuals will be responsive) and to continue vaccinating until an age at which virtually all can respond to vaccination. This strategy has economic disadvantages for the pet owner. Some manufacturers produce low-passage, high-virus-titer vaccines especially for use in situations where high titers of maternal antibodies and high pathogen exposure are anticipated. This is similar to a strategy once (but no longer) approved by the World Health Organization for vaccination of children in developing countries against measles (Gellin and Katz, 1994). Preliminary evidence suggests that incorporation of vaccine antigens in highly structured ISCOMs or nasal application of vaccines can enhance immune responses in the presence of maternal antibodies (Van Binnendijk et al., 1997; Brockmeier et al., 1997).",

Investigations of pathogen\u2013host interactions in outbred animals have illustrated the complexity of these interactions and have encouraged rethinking of established paradigms. Early studies of an enteric coronavirus infection of swine (TGEV) led to the concept of the gut\u2013mammary gland\u2013S-IgA immunologic axis and provided part of the basic tenet for a common mucosal immune system (Bohl et al., 1972; Saif et al., 1972). Later studies of TGEV and a deletion mutant of TGEV with respiratory tropism (PRCV) revealed that functional compartmentalization exists within the common mucosal immune system whereby nasal inoculation of pigs with PRCV failed to elicit sufficient intestinal IgA antibody responses to fully protect against the enteric pathogen TGEV (Van Cott et al., 1993, 1994). Subsequent studies have explored new prime/boost mucosal immunization strategies to elicit intestinal immunity to the enteric pathogen rotavirus in na\u00efve pigs (Saif, 1999b; Yuan and Saif, 2002). In these studies, only oral priming with attenuated virus led to successful nasal booster responses with use of nonreplicating (VLP) vaccines combined with mucosal adjuvants such as ISCOM or mLT. Thus, use of a replicating vaccine to prime lymphocytes at a major mucosal inductive site (GALT), followed by boosting with a nonreplicating vaccine at a second inductive site (NALT), effectively stimulated intestinal IgA antibodies and induced active protection against rotavirus diarrhea.",

In some instances attenuated organisms delivered by mucosal routes have demonstrated improved efficacy over nonreplicating antigens given by systemic routes.

In contrast, studies of ascending infections of the reproductive tract in cattle have demonstrated the efficacy of systemic vaccination to clear established infections and highlight the possibility of therapeutic vaccines.",

            "text": "Finally, it is important to realize that there are species differences to consider in designing vaccines to elicit mucosal immunity. For example, the primary Ig in mammary secretions of ruminants is IgG1, which is actively transported to the mammary gland from serum and provides effective passive immunity to the nursing offspring against enteric pathogens. Thus, parenteral immunization of the mother is effective in stimulating passive immunity in ruminants against enteric pathogens. In contrast, in monogastrics, IgA predominates in milk and IgA lymphoblasts that traffic to the mammary gland originate in the intestine. Therefore, oral vaccines in monogastrics may provide a more effective vaccine strategy to induce IgA antibodies in milk against enteric pathogens (Saif and Fernandez, 1996). If the aforementioned vaccine concepts and ones reviewed in this chapter are applied with new and effective mucosal adjuvants, delivery systems, and bioengineered vectors expressing the appropriate microbial antigens, it is likely that a new generation of veterinary vaccines will emerge to better cope with existing and emerging mucosal pathogens.",
