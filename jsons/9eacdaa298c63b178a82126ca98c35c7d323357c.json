Disease severity depends on age, underlying condition and type of virus. ARVIs account for huge numbers of doctor's visits and days lost from work and school. They are a leading cause of global mortality and morbidity in children. Moreover, respiratory viral infections are an important driver of unnecessary usage of antibiotics.

The identification of respiratory viruses in a clinical context can also guide diagnostic and treatment strategies. Bonner et al. [6] revealed that a known viral aetiology of disease results in decreased use of additional tests such as X-rays or blood examination, shorter hospital admission and less frequent use of antibiotics. However, molecular diagnostics have also created new dilemmas. For example, the identification of respiratory viruses in asymptomatic children, the occurrence of many viral co-infections, concerns about the pathogenic capacity of certain viruses and the value of quantitative measurements.",

Nowadays virologists can quickly discriminate virological families and related viruses from emerging viruses and consequently identify novel viruses. The introduction of molecular diagnostics in medical virology has led to the identification of many new respiratory viruses in children in the past 15 years (Table 16 .1). However, the pathogenicity of these viruses is not always clear and the clinical relevance is often poorly understood. Fredricks and Relman proposed seven rules which are necessary to demonstrate the causative relationship between a virus and disease. These rules are based on Koch's postulates and were adapted for nucleic acid based detection methods, location of the pathogen and quantification (Table 16. 2) [8, 9] . These rules can help to interpret research on the role of novel respiratory viruses in disease and guide future research. It should also be stated that the clinical relevance is in some cases apparent, without extensive research to fulfil all requirements.",

            "text": "The Hendra virus was first detected in a disease outbreak in 1994. It initially presented with a new respiratory disease in horses that was transmitted to two persons one of them died [10] . The virus belongs to the genus of Henipavirus within I. Ahout et al. the family of the Paramyxoviridae family. It was initially named morbillivirus and later re-named Hendra virus (HeV) after the suburb where the outbreak occurred [11, 12] . The virus itself is not very contagious. It spreads through direct contact between horses or during intensive contact between humans and severely ill horses. The animal reservoir appears to be the Flying-fox, in this population the Hendra infection is largely subclinical. The breading season of Flying-foxes is a risk period for spread and the human risk group is defined as people with close and intensive contact with horses. Up till now fourteen outbreaks have been reported [13] . In five of these outbreaks humans were involved, resulting in five deaths. So far, only two persons survived an infection. The case fatality rate (CFR) is over 50 % [13] . HeV in humans causes, after an incubation period of 5-21 days, a severe influenza like disease (fever, myalgia and headache) which can progress to pneumonia, respiratory failure and death [10, 14] . An infection can also result in encephalitis with headache, fever and drowsiness. The encephalitis can occur after initial recovery from the illness. The Hendra virus genome is readily detected in several materials, e.g. blood, urine, nasal-and oropharyngeal swabs by RT-PCR. Next to this standard detection method the virus can be cultured in several cell lines, where it forms syncytia upon infection. ELISA serological tests are used for screening, however their diagnostic sensitivity is not yet established. Immunofluorescense assays and serum neutralization methods can also be used [13, 15] .",

It was named Nipah virus (NiV) after the location of the first human case [17] . This virus had already caused respiratory disease in pigs until late 1996. Like HeV it shares the bat as a natural reservoir. NiV virus is very contagious among pigs and spreads through the respiratory route or directly by the transport of infected pigs. Initially humans became infected via direct contact with pigs, although food borne transmissions were also reported. Initially the case fatality rate was 38.5 % [14, 18] .

            "text": "Notably, the CFR's of these outbreaks increased to 92 %. Also the transmission changed: starting from pigs, soon cows could transmit the virus. Later human to human and nosocomial transmission was demonstrated [19] [20] [21] . It has been hypothesized that there were multiple introductions of viruses in the human population, explaining the unique genetic signature of isolated viruses nowadays [18] . These genetic differences may be the reason for the increase in CFR and differences in clinical manifestations 16 Elucidation and Clinical Role of Emerging Viral Respiratory Tract Infections in Children [8, 9] A nucleic acid sequence belonging to a putative pathogen should be present in most cases of an infectious disease. Microbial nucleic acids should be found preferentially in those organs or gross anatomic sites known to be diseased, and not in those organs that lack pathology Fewer, or no, copy numbers of pathogen-associated nucleic acid sequences should occur in hosts or tissues without disease With resolution of disease, the copy number of pathogen-associated nucleic acid sequences should decrease or become undetectable. With clinical relapse, the opposite should occur When sequence detection predates disease, or sequence copy number correlates with severity of disease or pathology, the sequence-disease association is more likely to be a causal relationship The nature of the microorganism inferred from the available sequence should be consistent with the known biological characteristics of that group of organisms Tissue-sequence correlates should be sought at the cellular level: efforts should be made to demonstrate specific in situ hybridization of microbial sequence to areas of tissue pathology and to visible microorganisms or to areas where microorganisms are presumed to be located These sequence-based forms of evidence for microbial causation should be reproducible and transmission. The clinical manifestation of a Nipah infection differed per outbreak. Incubation periods differ from an average of 2 weeks in Malaysia to 1 week in Bangladesh. The infection can be asymptomatic, but often starts with influenza-like symptoms of fever, headache, myalgia, vomiting and sore throat. Patients can recover or develop signs of encephalitis or sometimes atypical pneumonia or acute respiratory distress. In severe cases the encephalitis includes the brain stem or progresses to a coma within 24-48 h [18, 19, 22] . Around 20 % of the cases are left with residual neurological symptoms, including personality changes. In comparison with outbreaks in Malaysia and Singapore the Bangladesh and Indian patients experienced more profound respiratory symptoms with case rates of 14, 27, 70 and 51 %, respectively [19] . A Nipah infection can be diagnosed in serum urine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by RT-PCR [23] . Also culture in cell-lines, ELISA for anti-HeV IgG and IgM in serum and CSF, serum neutralization assays or immunofluorescence assays are used [18, 19, 24, 25] . Patients with both Hendra and Nipah virus infections are treated supportive, antiviral therapy is not effective [22] . Prevention is based on careful hygiene, quarantine and safe disposal of animal carcasses [13, 14] . Currently, there are no vaccines available. However, several therapeutic agents seem effective in vitro and in some animal models [18] .",

            "text": "The first cases of avian influenza virus (AIV) infection were reported in 1997 in Honk-Kong [26]. This influenza A (H5H1) originated completely from strains circulating in wild birds and poultry [27] . The avian influenza virus undergoes rapid genetic and antigenic evolution reflected by the occurrence of different clades with distinct phenotypes [28, 29] . The majority of human cases had direct contact with poultry or could be related to outbreaks in wild birds [20] . There is limited transmission from human to human, although some epidemiological stud-ies suggest it is possible [30] . The median age of patients is around 18 years and the mortality rate is extremely high between the age of 10 and 19 years (61 %). Yearly H5N1 outbreaks in humans have been reported in Asia, Africa and Eurasia [31] . These epidemics are all related to outbreaks of avian influenza in wild birds or poultry during the colder seasons [32, 33] . The incubation period of H5N1 is estimated to be 2-7 days [34] . The disease typically manifests as a severe pneumonia which often progresses to respiratory failure and death within 10 days (case fatality rate up to 90 % in children). It appears that in children cases may occur without pneumonia. Detection of viral RNA by (RT-) PCR is the best method for the diagnosis of H5N1, preferably using throat swabs [35] . Because of genetic variably of the virus, primers need to up-dated frequently. The available immune-assays for detection of H5N1 are not sensitive enough for clinical purposes and cannot differentiate between human and avian subtypes of influenza A. Seroconversion after 2-3 weeks can be used to confirm H5N1 infection and can be used for epidemiological studies [35] . Early treatment with oseltamivir is recommended based on some evidence that it increase survival rates [36] . There are differences in susceptibility to oseltamivir between the different clades of H5N1 circulating in different parts of the world. Combination of oseltamivir with amantidine can be given if the circulating H5N1 is susceptible to both agents. Currently, it is possible to produce vaccines that inactivate H5 influenza A strains. However due to the circulation of different clades and the rapidly changing antigenicity of H5N1 the need for the development of a new vaccine remains [34, 37] .",

It is related to respiratory syncytial virus, both belonging to the pneumoviridae sub-family. In both retrospective and prospective studies it has been shown that hMPV can be detected in 3.9-14.8 % of respiratory samples from children with respiratory disease [39] . This wide range reflects differences in the tested populations and the level of care. Coinfections with other viruses occur in 15-30 % [40] [41] [42] . hMPV is detected in up to 4 % of nasopharyngeal aspirates from healthy children, although percentages of less than 1 % are also frequently published [43] . Serological studies showed that all children by the age of 5 years had been in contact with the virus and that it has been circulating in the human population for over 50 years [38] . It has a seasonal occurrence with a peak incidence just after the influenza and RSV season [43] . Spread is thought to be via direct or close contact with respiratory secretions from an infected person with an incubation period of 3-5 days. Re-infections occur frequently in children, although symptoms are less severe [44] . Symptoms associated with hMPV infections are comparable with RSV (see Table 16 .3). hMPV infections are, after RSV, the most frequent cause of bronchiolitis in young children and account for 5-15 % of all hospital admissions [45] . Hospitalization rates are highest among 6-12 month old children, remarkably older than for RSV [46] . There is an association between severe hMPV infection (bronchiolitis) and the development of wheezing in childhood [47] .",

RT-PCR also provides semi-quantitative information of the viral load (Ct value), which can be used to monitor treatment in a research setting [49] . Immunofluorescence assays are available for rapid detection of the virus in respiratory specimens; however, these tests are less sensitive than RT-PCR. Serology for hMPV has little additive value in the clinic because most children are seropositive in early childhood. Currently no vaccines against hMPV are available, though several candidates are being pursued [45] . Ribavirin, antiviral therapy, is effective in vitro against hMPV, though clinical data are sparce.

They were recognized as the second most common cause of the common cold in humans [50] [51] [52] . A new strain of human coronavirus was identified in 2004 from a respiratory sample of a 7 month old infant with bronchiolitis and named NL63 (HCoV-NL63) [53] . The HCoV-NL63 belongs to the genus Coronavirus within the family of Coronavidae. In retrospective cohort studies HCoV-NL63 have been identified in 1.7-9.3 % of respiratory samples from children with respiratory symptoms and occurs worldwide [39] . The virus is often found in combination with other respiratory viruses (57 %) [54, 55] . Peak incidence is found in the winter months and the incubation period is estimated 16 Elucidation and Clinical Role of Emerging Viral Respiratory Tract Infections in Children [56, 57] . HCoV-NL63 is associated with mild upper respiratory tract symptoms and less frequent with severe lower respiratory tract symptoms such as bronchiolitis [58] . Some studies have reported an association with croup [55, 59] . HCoV-NL can be detected in respiratory specimens by RT-PCR which is the first choice for diagnosis. Immunoassays are available for rapid detection and distinction of different HCoV strains [60] . Different cell-lines are permissive for viral culture and used in a research setting. Currently no anti-viral treatment against HCo-ViNL63 is available, although several inhibiting compounds have been identified [61] . A second novel human coronavirus was identified in 2005 in a 71-year-old man with pneumonia in China and named HKU1 after the Hong Kong University where it was found [62] . In a retrospective cohort studies the HCoV-HKU1 was identified in 1-3.1 % of respiratory samples in which no other virus was detected, from children with upper and lower respiratory symptoms [39] with a higher incidence in children younger than 6 months. The peak incidence of HCoV-HKU1 is in spring, early summer and winter with an incubation period of 2 days [63] . HCoV-HKU1 is mainly associated with upper respiratory tract symptoms in children and occasionally with pneumonia and bronchiolitis [64] . The first choice of assay for detection in respiratory specimens is RT-PCR. Coronaviruses exhibit substantial genetic variability hampering the development of pancorona primers and therefore specific primers for each strain have to be used [65] . There is no specific anti-viral therapy available against HCoV-HKU1.",

            "text": "Human bocavirus (HBoV) belongs to the genus Bocavirus within the family Parvoviridae (and is closely related to the bovine parvovirus and canine minute virus). This virus was identified in 2005 by nucleic acid amplification (PCR) in respiratory tract specimens from Swedish children with lower respiratory tract infections [66] . In this study HBoV was detected in 3.1 % of hos-pitalized children below the age of three. Other studies detected HBoV in 3-19 % of children with respiratory symptoms depending on the sample type used (NPA and BAL higher, nasal swab lower) [67] and the age of the patient ( higher in younger children) [68] . However, HBoV is frequently found in asymptomatic children (up to 40 %) or in combination with other viruses (up to 80 %) in symptomatic children [39] . Based on these findings it is still unclear whether HBoV has a pathogenic role in respiratory disease. One study performed in a PICU suggests that the viral load (high titres) of HBoV may indicate a pathogenic role in (severe) respiratory disease [69] . HBoV has been associated with wheezing in asthmatic children [70] . In general HBoV infection is marked by relatively mild symptoms of the upper respiratory tract such as cough, rhinorrhea and fever. In rare cases it has been associated with lower respiratory tract infection and even respiratory insufficiency [71] . Detection of HBoV is by RT-PCR and the virus can be detected in respiratory as well as gastrointestinal specimens [72] . Diagnostic seroresponses can be used to establish the specific immune response against HBoV during infection, although the clinical relevance is unclear [73] . HBoV can only be cultured on ciliated primary human epithelial cell-lines, and therefore viral isolation is only used in experimental settings [74] . Treatment of HBoV infections is mainly supportive and no specific anti-viral treatment against HBoV is available. Currently there is not enough epidemiological evidence to drive vaccine development against HBoV.",

The first HPeVs, serotype 1 and 2, were identified 50 years ago during a summer diarrhoea outbreak in American children [75] . With the introduction of molecular techniques many new serotypes of HPeVs have been identified in the past 15 years in the stool or NPA of children with gastrointestinal and respiratory disease, and in the cerebrospinal fluid of children with meningitis and sepsis-like illness (see Table 16 .4) [76] [77] [78] [79] . Every HPeV serotype has its specific epidemiological and clinical features. All HPeVs infections are very common in children under the age of 1 year and most data are available on HPeV1 and HPeV3 [80] . The median age of infection with HPeV1 is 6.6 months, whereas HPeV3 infections occur at a younger age of 1.3 months. There is also seasonal variability in occurrence, HPeV1 in late summer and early winter season, and HBeV3 mostly in summer. HBeV serotype 5 and 6 have also been associated with respiratory tract symptoms [81] [82] [83] [84] .",

The second was identified in a nasopharyngeal aspirate of a 3-year-old child with pneumonia and named Washington University virus (WUV) [89] . Seroprevalence studies show KI in 66 % and WU in 79 % of paediatric sera [46, 90] . The virus has been detected in 1-5 % respiratory samples worldwide in respiratory samples of young symptomatic children [91] [92] [93] . However, in 70-80 % of the cases there was a coinfection with other respiratory viruses, and KIV and WUV have been described in asymptomatic HSCT patients [94] . Based on these results it is difficult to assign symptoms and pathogenicity to both of them and more epidemiological evidence is needed. In most studies the viruses have been associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children. Detection of WUV and KIV in respiratory samples can be undertaken by RT-PCR. Thus far there is no indication for treatment of either of these viruses nor vaccine development.",

After the initial detection several other countries reported H1N1 infections. In June 2009 the WHO declared a pandemic with spread over at least two continents. At the start of the pandemic the virus appeared to be very virulent with a high mortality rate, especially in young adults and children [97, 98] . However, in the Northern Hemisphere the virus behaved more like a seasonal influenza virus. H1N1 disease had the highest attack rate in young children causing relatively mild disease [99] . The pH1N1 was able to outcompete the seasonal flu so that, in the influenza season 2009-2010, over 99 % of the influenza positive isolates in Europe and America were pandemic H1N1 influenza A [101] .",

            "text": "In this review we have discussed newly identified and emerging viruses from the past 2 decades. These viruses could be subdivided in three categories, based on the evidence for their pathogenicity in respiratory disease in children. First, emerging viruses causing epidemics with high mortality, such as AIV, Hendra and Nipah virus, were clearly associated with a pathogenic role in disease. These epidemic-causing viruses are often of zoonotic origin (transmission from animals to humans). The second group comprises viruses that fulfil the modified Koch's postulates [8, 9] . Most novel respiratory viruses are not completely characterised according to the postulates due to the extensive and costly research needed to achieve this. In this perspective hMPV is unique among the recently discovered respiratory viruses, because all criteria have been fulfilled [111] . Third are viruses that were found during screening for new respiratory viruses in respiratory samples with molecular techniques, such as human bocavirus, the novel polyomaviruses, parechoviruses and some coronaviruses. For most of these viruses their pathogenic role as an important respiratory pathogen is less clear. Although these viruses are present in respiratory I. Ahout et al. [128] , Jain et al. [129] samples of children with respiratory disease however, they are also often present in asymptomatic children or found in combination with other viruses. Many studies were performed retrospectively, or without the proper control cohorts of asymptomatic children. In epidemiological studies based on seroconversion it is apparent that a first encounter with these viruses occurs early in childhood without (severe) respiratory tract infections. Especially in this last category of viruses, in which the association with respiratory disease is less clear, large prospective epidemiological studies are needed to further specify the pathogenicity and health burden of these viruses in children.",

Their ability to quantify the viral burden in infection may be used as additional information in determining the role of a virus in respiratory disease. For some viruses a positive correlation between viral load and disease severity is described [69, 115] . However whether viral load correlates with disease severity in general remains a point of debate. Viral load appears to be lower in viralviral co-infection compared to viral-mono-infections, the mechanism behind this and the clinical relevance requries further investigation [116, 117] . Studies show that viral load decreases during the course of disease, and this can be used as marker for the therapeutic effect of anti-viral compounds. A drawback of the high sensitivity of molecular diagnostics is that PCR signals remain positive after recovery from an illness, sometimes even for several weeks. Because young children have frequent viral infections of the upper respiratory tract, the value of a positive PCR test can be limited.",

In study-ing the pathogenicity of viruses these interactions should be taken into account and implemented in new epidemiological studies.
