Within a given syndromic disease, clinical signs caused by different pathogens can be very similar. It is often difficult to identify the actual causal agents based on disease symptoms (Giammarioli et al., 2008, Haines et al., 2013, Xu et al., 2012). In addition, mixed infections by different pathogens make it more difficult to achieve accurate diagnosis (Wernike et al., 2013b).",

            "text": "The conventional methods for diagnosis of viral diseases were mainly based on viral isolation in cell culture, which is time consuming (Xu et al., 2012); and not all viruses can be isolated. Although microarray and next generation sequencing can provide more comprehensive diagnosis (Chiu, 2013, Jaing et al., 2008, Nikolaki and Tsiamis, 2013, Peterson et al., 2010, Takeichi et al., 2013), they both are still too expensive and with longer turnaround time when used in the field of veterinary diagnostics. Polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) based technologies have been widely used for detection of a number of porcine pathogens (Giammarioli et al., 2008, Haines et al., 2013, Hole et al., 2006, Huang et al., 2009, Liu et al., 2013, Ma et al., 2008, McMenamy et al., 2011, Rao et al., 2014, Wernike et al., 2013b, Xu et al., 2012). However, most methods were focused on a single or a few pathogens, thus multiple PCR tests have to be performed if several pathogens are involved. To increase PCR detection efficiency, regular multiplex PCR and multiplex RT-PCR have been developed, in which more than one target sequence were amplified by including several pairs of primers and the amplified targets were differentiated by different-sized amplicons through DNA electrophoresis (Cao et al., 2005, Giammarioli et al., 2008, Huang et al., 2009, Lee et al., 2007, Li et al., 2007, Liu et al., 2013). These procedures involve extra efforts for post-PCR processing, and the sensitivity is generally one log lower than real-time PCR (Jacob et al., 2012, Noll et al., 2015). Multiplex real-time PCR or multiplex real-time RT-PCR has been increasingly used for high throughput testing with faster turnaround. Several multiplex real-time PCR/RT-PCR targeting swine pathogens were reported (Baxi et al., 2006, Diallo et al., 2011, Haines et al., 2013, Hole et al., 2006, Horwood and Mahony, 2011, Huang et al., 2009, Nagarajan et al., 2010, Thonur et al., 2012, Wernike et al., 2013a, Wernike et al., 2012). Most of these assays are focused on limited number of pathogens of a given syndrome, and not able to meet the requirements at the port of entry in many countries including China, which requires testing a wide range of common pathogens causing different syndromes, i.e., respiratory, reproductive or vesicular diseases, before entry. A more comprehensive and cost-effective panel assay that can rapidly detect these common swine pathogens has not been described.",

If multiple targets can be used, a target with more sequences and higher conservation level was used. Target gene sequences were obtained through BLAST search on GenBank website (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). All available sequences were collected and used for primer and probe designs to ensure high coverage over field strains. Downloaded sequences were aligned using CLC Main Workbench 7.0.3 (http://www.clcbio.com), and conserved regions were identified using BioEditor 1.6.1 (http://bioeditor.sdsc.edu/) prior to primer and probe designs. The primers and probes were designed in the most conserved region of the target gene that was identified from multiple sequence alignments to cover as many sequences as possible. The designed primers and probes have the coverage of 98% \u2212 99.5% of sequences obtained from the GenBank (Table 1), as calculated by percentage of total sequences that matched at least one forward primer, one reverse primer and one probe sequences for a given virus or viral genotype. The individual real-time PCR primers and probes were designed using Primer 3.0 software with the ultimate objective of grouping the assays to form multiplex reactions as indicated in Table 1. All primers were designed with the melting temperature (Tm) of approximately 60 \u00b0C and the probes were specifically designed with Tm of approximately 63 \u00b0C. The primers and probes were purposely designed within a narrow annealing temperature range to facilitate the optimization process for multiple reactions in the panel. In addition, the predicted amplicon size was limited to 70\u2013150 bp for each primer pair to potentially increase the reaction sensitivity. Primers and probes in each subpanel were checked for potential secondary structures and dimer formations prior to synthesis. All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA, USA). The information of the primer and probe sequences, amplicon sizes, targeted genes, and numbers of available sequences used for the design for each virus are outlined in Table 1.",
