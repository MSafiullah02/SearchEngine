The transmission of COVID- 19 has not yet been fully elucidated, but we do know that the virus can be spread by respiratory droplets resulting in a severe lower respiratory tract infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome. 1 Along with other countries, the majority of the United States has issued 'stay-at-home' orders to slow the spread of the disease. However, physicians and healthcare providers continue to go to work each day with great personal risk to themselves and their families. Furthermore, personal protective equipment (PPE) designed to protect healthcare workers has universally become short in supply.",

            "text": "During the peri-intubation period, aerosolization can occur during spontaneous ventilation through a facemask for denitrogenation, endotracheal tube insertion, endotracheal extubation and anytime bag-valve mask (BVM) is utilized. Attempts to prevent disease transmission during the peri-intubation period have included standardization of rapid sequence intubations and the use of a video laryngoscope for all COVID-19 positive patients. However, with these unique challenges comes unique innovations. In an attempt to combat the shortage of PPE and protect healthcare providers, a Taiwanese physician (Lai, Hsien Yung (Mennonite Christian Hospital, Hua Lian, 2020)) developed a simple, yet intuitive invention to reduce the spread of aerosols during endotracheal intubation. 2 Commonly referred to as the 'aerosol box,' this invention encloses a patient's head within an acrylic or polycarbonate rectangular barrier (Figure 1 ) in attempt to reduce the direct spread of aerosols onto a provider during endotracheal intubation. A clear transparent box is rested on a mattress at the head of the bed. An opening along the caudal surface allows the patient's head to be placed inside of the box. Two small circular openings on the cephalad surface of the box are designed for a provider to place their arms through to perform the intubation. The original design was published in the New England Journal of Medicine and features the effectiveness of droplet containment during a simulated cough. 3 When attempting to use this design within our own institution, several pitfalls quickly became apparent, which could compromise patient safety. We found that the box was too wide and would not fit on a standard operating room table. The arm insertion holes were too small making it difficult to maneuver inside the box. Obese patients cannot fit inside of the box and the roof of the box was too low making maneuvering an endotracheal tube, double-lumen tube or bougie difficult. The original box was heavy and unstable and reverse Trendelenburg position could not be achieved. In addition, an assistant could not provide cricoid/laryngeal pressure without contaminating themselves and a BVM or breathing circuit was challenging to use inside of the box. Lastly, the several openings of the box made it unlikely that aerosols were maximally contained.",

            "text": "In a collaborative effort between anesthesiology and engineering at the University of California San Diego, modifications to the original design were made to address each of these problems (Figure 2) . The dimensions of the box and circular arm insertion holes were modified allowing the box to fit on standard operating room tables and provide better maneuverability when a provider's arms were inside the box. Shoulder cutouts were also created to accommodate obese patients. For stability, an adjustable L-bracket flange was designed to slide underneath any sized mattress, which also allowed for bed position changes and use in the intensive care unit. To accommodate a breathing circuit and BVM, a 3 cm slit was created on each side of the box to easily insert and remove the circuit. An accessory arm hole was made on the right side of the box for an assistant to provide cricoid/laryngeal pressure while still providing maximal barrier protection. A switch from acrylic to polycarbonate (popularly known as LEXAN, its trade name) improves impact durability and relative ease of sterilization. 4 Lastly, to better ensure the containment of aerosols, all arm insertion hole openings and slits have removable covers reinforced with a silicone-based sealant. A reusable clear drape was added to seal the back of the box for maximal protection.",

A thermo-bender was used to apply heat along bending lines on the polycarbonate sheet forming the 3D shell. The edges were sealed with 90\u00b0 angled polycarbonate strips and a plastic adhesive (Weld-on 16, Compton, CA). Polycarbonate hinges and circular polycarbonate discs were used to provide the shutters for the arm access holes at the front and on the sides. Flexible plastic sheet (Worbla, Eplastics, San Diego, CA) was cut to shape forming the side panels. Slits were made in the side panels to accommodate access and provide smooth passage for ventilator circuit tubing. An L-bracket measuring 15 cm by 27 cm each side was attached to the enclosure using 50 mm polycarbonate screws and hex nuts. A 25 mm thick acrylic plate measuring 15 cm by 21 cm was used to provide a space between the enclosure and the L-bracket. This facilitates a stop gap between the enclosure and the top of the mattress.",

In addition to providing a barrier during the intubation of a cardiac patient, the box can be used while transporting intubated cardiac patients with BVM from the operating room to the intensive care unit, reducing aerosol spread and exposure. This would also free up transport ventilators, which have become standard to use while transporting COVID-19 positive patients. Furthermore, the increased height and larger arm holes also allow for more favorable conditions while intubating and extubating patients with double-lumen tubes for thoracic procedures. Compared to other barrier devices, the aerosol box has the advantage of being reusable if properly maintained and cleaned, which is becoming increasingly important with the shortage in PPE. Simulated training prior to clinical use is recommended. The box should be removed immediately in an emergency and not used in known or suspected difficult airways.",
