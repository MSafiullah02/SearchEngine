Coles and Woolworths' customers will have to go elsewhere for their pet's favourite brand after Mars pulled the plug on distribution to the two supermarket giants following a price rise disagreement. Mars produce 55 different pet food brands globally, including Royal Canin, Pedigree, Whiskas, Dine and My Dog. Representatives from the supermarkets said they expected a deal to be brokered soon. You can't be what you can't see I spent much of January and February of this year buried in research and thinking about women, leadership and the future of our profession. Social media is littered with quotes and catchphrases about leadership. One that stuck with me through the data and the papers is 'you can't be what you can't see'. If you can't see someone that seems similar to you in a position of leadership, then it can be difficult to believe that that role, or one similar to it, is possible for you, or although it might be possible, the cost of forging a scarcely trodden path may be too great.",

I have seen several members of our profession profess that as a natural consequence of more women in the profession, there will be increasing gender representation in leadership positions overtime. This is an alluring proposition, but not one supported by the data. Vertical segregation describes the phenomenon where there is predominance of men in more senior positions, and a predominance of women in more junior positions. Vertical segregation occurs across every aspect of the Australian economy, and even in female dominated professions, women are under-represented in leadership roles. The reasons for this are a complex interaction of unconscious bias, structural and cultural factors that require more discussion than can be accommodated in this column. One of the recommended interventions however, is to shed light on diverse role models.",

In early April the Animal Health Quadrilateral group (Quads), senior animal health officials from Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States met for their annual meeting. The issue of attracting, developing and retaining government veterinarians was an item of keen interest on the agenda. Government veterinarians play critical, unique and diverse roles in a country's veterinary services, which underpin a country's animal health status and trade. The risks and opportunities in animal health will continue to evolve, as will the expectations, interests and demographics of the veterinary profession. The future will bring new information and diagnostic technologies; changes to risk and community expectations; and evolving communication needs. Therefore, we need to be proactive, and ensure the skills of future veterinarians reflect this changing context. In the field of government veterinary services there may be a need for increased veterinary public health specialist expertise, such as epidemiology, risk management, and diagnostics. It's also expected that we will need to increase our collaboration with experts from other disciplines such as information technology and data analysis; laboratory, public health, social and environmental scientists; communications professionals; and economists.",

One particular worker was said to be on an \"unpaid internship\" for a 6-month period -even though the nature of their engagement was that of an employee. The Commission found that the business had failed to pay the workers their minimum entitlements under relevant employment legislation including minimum hourly rates, penalty rates and leave entitlements. As a result of the underpayment, the company was penalised around $275,000 and the sole director was individually penalised a further $54,000. Back pay was also ordered in full to the three workers. The severity of the penalty was largely due to the fact the company were said to have known they were under paying staff, with the Commission labelling the underpayments \"significant and deliberate\".",

It's such an important skill -not just for interacting with clients and achieving the best outcome but to make sure we're working well together. The feedback I get from my team is important to me. As great as it is to have the constant loop of positives and 'yes men', sometimes I just need to be told I'm being a bit of an idiot. Keeping my team comfortable to be that voice of reason helps me take stock of what I'm doing and means they are engaged in the decisions we make for the clinic.",

I would probably put it down to having a fantastic support network, including people from my private life. I can acknowledge I've been fortunate in that regard and it probably isn't the case for many of my peers. In a lot of ways, it comes down to having someone you can relate to who's been through the process. With a shifting demographic in the profession, I can imagine that's not always easy. That said, I did have a client ask how work experience was going for me the other day\u2026 I've certainly drawn some inspiration from my conversation with Zach. Hopefully for some of you reading it does the same, giving you that extra bit of encouragement to be brave and take a leap. Similarly, if you're already a business owner keep an eye out; there are a fair few sharp minds coming through the ranks that could use your help. I'm fascinated by the prospect of more people like Zach taking steps forward in business and the impact their innovation has on the profession, even if it's just one workplace at a time. All things considered, I should probably pick up that copy of Barefoot Investor that's been sitting on my coffee Surprisingly, cats of all ages, and with both effusive (wet) and non-effusive (dry) forms, responded equally well to the treatment. The response was dramatic, with fever typically resolving within 12-36 hours of commencement and concurrent daily improvements in appetite, activity levels and weight gain were seen. Cats with the effusive form had a reduction in abdominal effusion over a 1-2-week period within 10-14 days of commencing treatment. After 2 weeks of treatment, all 26 cats that had responded to treatment appeared normal, or near normal, to their owners.",

The studies examined the effects of two manufactured chemicals; diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and polychlorinated biphenyl 153 (PCB153).

Prior to using the 50-year-old sample, Dr Rickard assessed the quality of the sperm by examining motility, velocity, viability and DNA integrity and found no difference between the sperm frozen for 50 years and samples frozen just 12 months prior.",

The device, known as 'the EquiVi platform', aims to provide accurate and reliable monitoring of vital signs of horses over prolonged periods and during exercise. The device can monitor respiratory rate, blood oxygen saturation, temperature, blood pressure and heart rate variability in real time with immediate access to data. The data can then be used by trainers and veterinarians to aid in the development of fitness programs to enhance performance, while also improving welfare through early detection of disease and allowing minimally intrusive monitoring of individual sick horses.Dr Ben Metcalfe is pioneering the project and said that although there is technology that exists that can monitor the different aspects of a horse's health using sensors, these typically don't work while the horse is moving and the information has often had little clinical validation because many sensors used are designed for humans. Those involved with the project are hoping to further develop the technology to a commercial level to allow widespread use of the wearable devises within the equine industry to improve overall horse welfare and performance.",
