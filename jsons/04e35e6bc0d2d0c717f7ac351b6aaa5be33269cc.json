Given the severity of this pandemic, it will likely fundamentally impact the use of these services for years to come. Our institution and radiation oncology department have used telemedicine services for many years; we would like to report on our departmental experience to guide other radiation oncology practices on its longterm use for clinical evaluation and patient care. Our institution's telemedicine program provides clinical services for a number of remote locations and represents the largest telehealth network in the world, with over 300 sites and 60,000 patient encounters a year. Specifically for our radiation oncology department, over 200 patient encounters occur via telemedicine a year. Patients report great appreciation and satisfaction with these encounters, as they eliminate the time and energy needed for travel from long distances. It has resulted in improved efficiency and costeffectiveness as well. Based on our institutional experience, our long-term vision for telemedicine (after the COVID-19 pandemic has hopefully subsided) is as an excellent and costefficient tool to provide long-term follow-up for patients, especially for those who live far away in rural or underserved areas.",

YYY has an agreement with the XXX where a large portion of inmates in the system receives specialty medical care via YYY.

After therapy is completed, patients may be seen for follow-up in-person or via telemedicine. This decision is made by the treating physician only and typically depends on the disease site being treated. For example, prostate cancer patients are seen in-person for the first follow-up visit, after that they are seen via telemedicine with remote monitoring of PSA levels. In contrast, for head and neck patients, follow-up appointments are seen in-person for the first several visits to monitor for disease recurrence and recovery from acute side effects. After that, they are typically seen via telemedicine. The majority of patients seen via telemedicine are prostate cancer patients, which is largely due to disease prevalence. Most telemedicine encounter visits involve patients within the first two years of radiation treatment completion. During the telemedicine visit, radiation oncologists may assess inmates for signs/symptoms of cancer recurrence, treatment side effects, or long-term toxicities. If there are any clinical concerns (with a low threshold of suspicion), in-person appointments with their radiation oncologists can be scheduled quickly. If there are no concerning/alarm symptoms, the inmates will be continued to be followed in-person by their unit providers (where basic labs and imaging can be ordered as needed) as well as their radiation oncologists via telemedicine appointments. If imaging studies are required, they are completed either locally (close to their unit) or at our institution before their next scheduled appointment; the imaging reports are routed to the ordering physician for review and further recommendations. In between telemedicine appointments, if there is any concerning change in the clinical course of an inmate (abnormal symptoms, labs, or imaging findings), the treating radiation oncologist is notified and an inperson appointment is scheduled quickly.",

Inmates in the XXX express great appreciation for this opportunity, as journey to YYY may involve several days of arduous travel back and forth. Due to their protected research status, collecting prospective data from inmates is restricted, but previously reported internal data indicate high degrees of satisfaction for patients, nurses, and specialty physicians. 7 The telemedicine system has also served as a way to limit costs in an increasingly expensive healthcare environment; based on the most recent reported data from 2015, Texas spent $4077 per inmate, which is less than the median state expenditure of $5720 and $15,000 less than the state with the highest expenditure, California, at $19,796 8 .",

First, incorporating telemedicine services may serve as a way to improve efficiency by reducing the time and costs needed for follow-up appointments. In addition, telemedicine also allows for increased convenience for patients, particularly for those from rural/underserved areas who may have to travel long distances for care and evaluation. Telemedicine also allows for continuity of care with patients who would otherwise not be able to follow up with their treating radiation oncologists. The treating physician is the person who is going to be most familiar with a patient's chances for disease control, side effects, complications, and long-term toxicities. Leaving survivorship follow-up to other healthcare providers may lead to suboptimal clinical management.",

Telemedicine may further mitigate the role of physical examination, which is an important tool for assessing disease recurrence (i.e. digital rectal exams for prostate cancer, flexible laryngoscopies for head & neck cancer, pelvic exams for gynecologic cancers, etc.). However, this downside could be minimized by using telemedicine for follow-up after 3-5 years post-treatment, when the risk of recurrence is lower. In addition, telemedicine need not be solely used as a way to replace inperson follow-up visits, but as a supplementary tool to screen patients who need in-person follow-up visits. In addition, further improvements in technology may even allow for remote/virtual physical examinations.",
