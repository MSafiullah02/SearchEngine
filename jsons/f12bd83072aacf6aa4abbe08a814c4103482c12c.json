This work proposes a scheme to monitor the temporal evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic using the time series of its total number of confirmed cases in a given region. The monitored parameter is the spread rate obtained from this time series (day -1 ) expressed in %/day. The scheme's capability is verified using the epidemic data from China and South Korea. Its projection capability is shown for Italy and United States with scenarios for the ensuing 30 days from April 2 nd , 2020. The spread rate (relative rate of change of the time series) is very sensitive to sudden changes in the epidemic evolution and can be used to monitor in real-time the effectiveness of containment actions. The logarithm of this variable allows identifying clear trends of the evolution of the COVID-10 epidemic in these countries. The spread rate calculated from the number of confirmed cases of infection is interpreted as a probability per unit of time of virus infection and containment actions. Its product with the number of confirmed cases of infections yields the number of new cases per day. The stabilization and control of the epidemic for China and South Korea appear to occur for values of this parameter below 0\u00b777 %/day (doubling time of 90 days).",

The decline of the reproduction number is associated to intervention actions.

They report success in identifying the impact of containment measures on the infection spread. 15 For temporal monitoring purposes, Park et al 16 suggest the use of the spread rate (relative rate of change) of the time series of the incidence instead of the reproduction number which, as a unitless quantity, does not contain any information about time.",

Regarding the first approximation, it is a good approximation in the beginning of the epidemic when its growth is exponential and much bigger than the recovery rate. Regarding the second approximation, if it is not verified the analyst must consider the results with care. Figure 2 shows the net relative infection rate for China and South Korea obtained through Eq. 6 using the data presented in Figure 1 . The x-axis shows the days and the day 0 corresponds to 2020/01/31. The y-axis is presented on a logarithmic scale to ease comparing the rates of change in China and South Korea along the studied period. The straight line represents a condition of net relative infection rate of 0\u00b777 %/day or 90 days of doubling time, a period sufficiently long to control it and plan and take actions to provide needed infrastructure to national health systems. In other words an epidemic condition in which the health systems can control it and manage its consequences. Figure 2 shows that in China, before actions of social containment in January 2020, the net probability of infection or net relative rate of infection was 40 %/day. After the containment actions started it dropped to between 0\u00b704 and 0\u00b71 %day. South Korea started rapidly its containment action (beginning of March) and its net relative rate of infection dropped and stabilized around 1 %/day and then around 0\u00b73 %/day. The epidemic condition of this two countries was one of very slow transmission rate (very low net relative rate of infection) with doubling times between 200 and 2000 days.",

If the latter grows significantly, the target lower net relative rate of infection has to be lower and, consequently, the effort to contain the spread of the epidemic is greater.

The curves for Italy and USA show similar behaviour when compared to China. They started with net relative rates of infection between 20 and 30 %/day and after introducing measures of social isolation their figures began to drop.The figure also presents projections for Italy and the United States based on the linear extrapolation of the previous behaviour between the days 50 and 62, that is, between March 21 st and April 2 nd , 2020. The slopes of the extrapolations are -0\u00b70856 %/day 2 for Italy and -0\u00b70730 %/day 2 for the USA. The linear extrapolation of the net relative rate of infection of these two countries, considering that their respective behaviours in these 13 days are repeated, indicates that Italy and the United States cross the 90 day doubling time line around the days 80 and 100, respectively. It should be noted that such results represent a scenario that may occur only if the previous conditions persist.The figure shows the projected estimations for Cn and NCn for the next 30 days.

In China, the net relative rate of infection was 40 %/day and that country started its measures to control the spread of infection in their society. At this time, the doubling time of the number of infected persons was between 2 and 3 days. The measures of social isolation were very strong and produced a continuous reduction of . On February 25 th , the rate was already less than 1 %/day (70 days of doubling time) and on March 8, less than 0\u00b71 %/day (700 days of doubling time or about 2 years). On 03/27/2020 the confirmed number of infected people in China was 81394, the net relative infection rate was 0\u00b706 %/day and the number of new cases per day, very small.The infection reached the other countries strongly in March 2020. In South Korea, the infection process started a little earlier and the country took drastic measures to contain the spread of the virus, including social isolation. In early March, South Korea's net relative infection rate was just below 20 %/day (3\u00b75 days of doubling time). After March 15 th it stabilized around 1",
