Most commonly, a blow to the lower left chest wall can result in an injury to the spleen [1]. Conversely, several case reports exist in the literature of abdominal impact resulting in an intrathoracic injury, such as a pneumothorax. One such report by Roberts [4] described an ice hockey player who was checked into the boards and sustained an impact over his left lower ribs. Initial concern for a splenic injury proved unfounded, and he was allowed to return to the game. However, he was too uncomfortable to continue, and assessment afterward revealed a 15% pneumothorax on chest x-ray. Hence, pulmonary injury from abdominal trauma can occur without disruption of the diaphragm. Diaphragm rupture is uncommon but is usually left sided (70\u201390%), as the liver appears to protect the right side.",

While ultrasonography is not as sensitive for intra-abdominal trauma, does not provide as much anatomic detail, does not allow for injury grading [14], and remains operator dependent, it does have a role, for instance, in the hemodynamically unstable patient [15, 16]. Hoffman et al. described a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 99% in detecting intra-abdominal injuries [16], while Berkoff suggests sensitivity of 60% (95% CI 49\u201370) [17]. Ultrasound visualizes free intraperitoneal fluid well, though it may not identify the injured organ [18]. Conditions identified on ultrasound in unstable patients will eventually require CT to identify the injury and to guide management [18]. The use of abdominal ultrasound for evaluation of unstable patients has been described by the term \u201cfocused assessment with sonography for trauma\u201d (FAST) [19]. The FAST examination aims to recognize peritoneal fluid/blood, which typically arises from a solid organ injury. A hypotensive athlete who has suffered abdominal trauma with a positive finding on a FAST examination has a higher likelihood of operative management [17, 19\u201326].",

Pneumothorax related to sporting activity or injury is relatively uncommon. Spontaneous occurrences have been reported in a number of sports such as soccer [33] and weight lifting [34]. Pneumothorax as a result of blunt trauma during sports generally involves deceleration of the athlete\u2019s thorax against a moving or a stationary object, as has been reported in skiing and snowboarding [35], bicycling [36], football, and ice hockey [37].",

However, if the loss of air into the pleural space continues, tension can result with concomitant shift of the mediastinum away from the side of the pneumothorax. Such a tension pneumothorax requires immediate decompression with a needle into the chest cavity and, optimally, by a tube thoracostomy. If this is not done, the continued pressure and mediastinal shift will lead to respiratory compromise by inhibition of airflow into the working lung and to cardiac compromise by a reduction in venous return to the heart.",

Thoracoscopic talc pleurodesis has been shown to be an effective intervention in recurrent or persistent spontaneous pneumothoraces [43]. The athlete can resume normal activity within a few days of discharge or as other injuries allow. Occasionally, a small, simple pneumothorax of 20% or less can be treated without tube thoracostomy if the patient is asymptomatic and has no other injuries. This approach requires careful observation and repeat chest x-ray to document stability. Regardless of treatment type, recurrence rates of primary spontaneous pneumothorax are reportedly high in children, up to 54% [44]. Return to physical activity should be delayed until complete resolution of the pneumothorax [45]. Symptoms of primary spontaneous pneumothorax often resolve within 24 h, even prior to resolution of the pneumothorax [46]. Therefore, return to play should be determined on a case-by-case basis. Current guidelines recommend avoidance of air travel within 2\u20133 weeks following a pneumothorax, due to concern that a volume of air trapped in the pleural cavity may expand and develop into a tension pneumothorax in the lower cabin pressure of a commercial airplane in flight [47].",

Children appear prone to this injury in the absence of a rib fracture because of the compressive nature of the rib cage [31].

Most cases occur in teenage males, with a mean age of 15 years, and it has been speculated that the more compliant chest cage of younger athletes may make them more susceptible to these impacts. Over half of reported commotio cordis events occur during organized competitive sports, with the remainder occurring during practice or daily activities. The majority of blows resulting in commotio cordis are the result of a small projectile impacting the chest, such as a baseball, lacrosse ball, or hockey puck, while the rest are from bodily contact [56].",

An impact must occur directly over the precordium, with a small enough surface area to transmit all of the energy from the collision to the heart [52, 59]. If this occurs exactly at the time of ventricular repolarization, just before the peak of the T wave, there is a 10\u201320 ms period of susceptibility that can result in ventricular fibrillation [54, 57\u201360]. In animal models, when a blow occurs outside this time, other arrhythmias may result, including heart block or bundle branch blocks [57].",

Creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase-myocardial band (CKMB) have not shown diagnostic utility [68]; however, the combination of a normal cardiac troponin and normal electrocardiogram (EKG) is predictive of the absence of clinically significant cardiac trauma [70\u201372]. Most experts recommend obtaining an EKG and cardiac troponin if cardiac trauma is suspected, and further evaluation such as echocardiography should be obtained if the results are abnormal. Patients with EKG abnormalities or elevated troponin should be monitored for 24\u201348 h, as most dysrhythmias will occur during the first 24\u201348-h period after injury [64, 69, 70, 74, 75].

Fractures of the upper zone or lower zone ribs, multiple fractures, and flail segments are less likely to be isolated injuries than other patterns of rib fractures and may result in injury to surrounding structures [76, 80]. Acute traumatic impact fractures of the first and second rib are often associated with neck trauma and vascular injuries, as well as pneumothorax, lung laceration, and hemothorax. Direct impact fractures of the lower ribs may injure the kidneys, liver, or spleen. Splenic trauma has been reported in up to 20% of left lower rib fractures and acute liver trauma in up to 10% of right lower rib fractures [77]. Fractures of the first rib and the floating rib are generally thought to be more common in sports [76].

Patients with significant chest trauma should be referred to the emergency department for evaluation with a CT scan, which can also assess for associated intrathoracic and intra-abdominal injuries. An emerging diagnostic modality in the assessment of acute rib fracture is thoracic ultrasound. Some early studies suggest that ultrasound is effective and may be more accurate than x-ray in detecting rib fractures in the acute setting [95, 98\u2013100]. Ultrasound is also useful and potentially more accurate than x-ray in the assessment of other injuries associated with rib fractures, including pneumothorax and pulmonary contusion [5\u20137].",

However, plain radiographs may initially be negative with stress fractures prior to callus formation, and diagnosis typically requires a triple-phase bone scan [101\u2013103]. CT scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also be useful for definitive diagnosis [115]. Rest from sport is suggested for a period of 4\u20136 weeks, though there is little evidence regarding the best approach to return to sport [116, 117]. Delayed union and nonunion are the most common complications of first rib stress fractures in throwing athletes.

This diagnosis has remained somewhat elusive, in part due to variation in definitions within the literature. Scott and Scott described the more inclusive \u201cpainful rib syndrome\u201d as the clinical presentation of pain in the lower chest or abdomen, a tender spot on the lower costal margin, and reproduction of pain by pressing that spot [118]. Slipping rib syndrome may also mimic abdominal pathology, due to its common presentation with upper abdominal pain [119]. The condition typically involves the eighth, ninth, and tenth ribs. These ribs are attached to each other by fibrous tissue in adults and by cartilaginous tissue in children. It is believed that when these connections are weakened or ruptured by trauma, the ribs can slip and impinge on the intercostal nerve, producing pain [120]. Rib-tip syndrome is usually unilateral; however, it may be bilateral [118, 121]. This condition particularly affects running, vigorous arm exercise, arm abduction, and swimming [101]. It has been reported more frequently in adults but nevertheless is a cause of rib and upper abdominal pain in adolescent and collegiate athletes [122\u2013124].",

A positive test reproduces the patient\u2019s pain and results in a click. Direct tenderness over the cartilage is another frequent finding. The diagnosis is clinical, and diagnostic imaging is generally not helpful, although it may exclude other conditions. Intercostal nerve blocks may be useful in establishing the diagnosis.

Acute traumatic sternal fractures are frequently seen in association with deceleration injuries and/or direct blows to the chest in adults, though a case series in children suggested that more minor blunt trauma may be a common mechanism in this age group [139]. Isolated sternal fractures from direct impact do not pose significant risk to the athlete. Injuries to the sternum have traditionally led to a search for associated cardiac, great vessel, and pulmonary injuries caused by the anatomic proximity of these structures, but associated morbidity with these injuries is low. Studies in both Europe and the United States have shown the mortality associated with isolated sternal fractures to be less than 1%, and the incidence of associated blunt cardiac injury to be low [140\u2013142]. Nevertheless, it is important that one carefully assess the pediatric patient who presents with a sternal fracture for symptoms of other potentially associated injuries. These include pneumothorax, pulmonary contusion, and cardiac contusion.",

They may also occur as a stress injury.Fractures of the first four ribs or the last two ribs, multiple fractures, and flail segments may result in injury to surrounding structures.Scapular fractures are unusual in sports and are often missed initially.\n",
