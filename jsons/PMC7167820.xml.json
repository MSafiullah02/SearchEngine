Already in 1683, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek observed and described biofilms by using his primitive microscope on matter from his own teeth. However, the biofilm lifestyle of microorganisms were of no interest to medical microbiologists until the early 1970s when Nils H\u00f8iby observed a link between the etiology of a persistent infection and aggregates of bacteria in cystic fibrosis patients [1]. Since then, biofilms have been recognized to be involved in many clinical infections [2,3], and evidence is accumulating that biofilms contribute to the pathogenesis, especially in chronic infections [4].",

The biofilm matrix consists of substances like proteins (e.g., fibrin), polysaccharide (e.g., alginate), as well as eDNA. In addition to the protection offered by the matrix, bacteria in biofilms can employ several survival strategies to evade the host defense systems. By staying dormant and hidden from the immune system, they may cause local tissue damage and later cause an acute infection. Within the biofilm, the bacteria adapt to environmental anoxia and nutrient limitation by exhibiting an altered metabolism, gene expression, and protein production, which can lead to a lower metabolic rate and a reduced rate of cell division [3,5]. In addition, these adaptations make the bacteria more resistant to antimicrobial therapy by inactivating the antimicrobial targets or reducing the requirements for the cellular function that the antimicrobials interfere with. During a biofilm infection, simultaneous activation of both innate and acquired host immune responses may occur; neither of which are able to eliminate the biofilm pathogen, but instead accelerate collateral tissue damage [6]. Consequently, biofilm-related diseases are typically persistent infections that develop slowly, are rarely resolved by the immune system, and respond inconsistently to antimicrobial treatments.",

            "text": "Predisposing factors associated with the development of OM have been extensively studied. One is the anatomy of the Eustachian tube in infants and children <1 year of age. The tube has a shorter, wider, and more horizontal course that promotes the transmission of otopathogenic bacteria from the nasopharynx to the middle ear cavity, which increases the risk of OM [10]. Colonization of the nasopharynx by otopathogenic bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NT-Hi), in early childhood considerably increases the risk of subsequent episodes of AOM and OME later in life [12,13]. Although these findings pointed toward bacteria being important in the development of chronic otitis media, it was difficult to demonstrate residual bacterial colonization due to negative cultures in research studies in the past [14]. In spite of these negative cultures, studies were showing increasingly more evidences that bacteria were a part of the pathogenesis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) demonstrated bacterial DNA in the absence of positive cultures [15,16]. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed metabolically active bacteria in the presence of negative culture in patients with OME. This led to the hypothesis that biofilms were a part of the pathogenesis of chronic otitis media and OME [17]. Later research found biofilms located in the middle ear of both humans and animal models, by a variety of different modalities like scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Today, biofilms are generally considered a part of the pathogenesis of OM [18,19,20].",

One main theory behind cholesteatoma formation is pneumatization failure and inflammatory conditions of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, leading to reduced middle-ear pressure. This can lead to retraction pocket formation, epidermal migration failure, and eventually cholesteatoma formation [31,32]. Since biofilms have been demonstrated in the middle ear and mastoid process mucosa, and the fact that biofilms have been linked to inflammatory changes in the mucosa and ventilation changes in the middle ear [33], one hypothesis is that a biofilm infection could cause favorable conditions for cholesteatoma pathogenesis and that cholesteatomas are favorable to biofilm [27]. Biofilms have been found in up to 81.3% of cholesteatomas [19,27,28,29,30] supporting the hypothesis that the keratinized matrix may be a favorable environment for biofilm formation. When a biofilm is established in a cholesteatoma it can lead to relapsing infections with draining ear and a recalcitrant course, which is commonly observed in aural cholesteatoma [27,32,34,35].",

It is one of the most common chronic infectious diseases worldwide, often occurring in the first 5 years of life and more common in developing countries [36,37]. There have been several scientific papers demonstrating biofilms in CSOM patients. These studies showed presence of biofilm in a range from 42% (in the mastoid mucosa) to 92% (when the middle ear is included) and being significantly more than in the controls [28,35,38]. Saunders on the other hand, found biofilm in only one out of seven patients [30]. In patients with recurrent OM (ROM), defined as three or more episodes in 6 months, biofilm was observed in 17 out of 20 children (21 out of 25 ears examined) in biopsies taken during undergoing tympanostomy tube placement [19]. Biofilms could be one reason for the relapsing nature for ROM and CSOM in spite of the appropriate antibiotic therapy. Orally administered antibiotics do not reach the concentrations in the middle ear that is needed to eradicate biofilms [39].",

Although the tube insertion are used in RAOM, it may be a cause of biofilm infection. Post-tympanostomy otorrhea is a common complication and in one meta-analysis occurred in 26% of patients (17% of intubated ears) during the intubation time [42]. One survey even found otorrea in 83% in an 18-month period [40]. There have been several studies to demonstrate biofilms on tympanostomy tubes [43,44]. Further to demonstrate the connection between biofilm and post-tympanostomy otorrhea, a study of persistent otorrhea 9 out of 15 patients showed positive labeling of extracellular DNA (eDNA) and integration host factor (IHF) in otorrhea samples indicating that biofilm may have a role in persistent otorrhea [45]. Failure of topical antibiotic therapy and persistent otorrhea may lead to the additional use of antibiotics and the need for tympanostomy tube removal [46,47].",

Treatment with antibiotics are often difficult even if the bacteria are sensitive to the selected antibiotic. Successful treatment with antibiotics often require prolonged intravenous administration. In cases where antibiotic treatment is unsuccessful, surgical excision and replacement of the infected valve might be an option. Most of what is known about the pathogenesis of endocarditis involving biofilms is learned from animal studies using rabbits [48]. The biofilm on the valve consists primarily of bacteria and biofilm matrix components, platelets and fibrin derived from the circulation. First the endothelial surface of the valve gets injured, second a formation of the sterile clot like lesion of platelets and fimbrin occurs at the site of the injury. Then bacteria starts to adhere to the thrombus before microcolonies are formed and lastly a mature biofilm is formed and pieces of the mature biofilm can cause embolization [48,49].",

The criteria are based on clinical, echocardiographic, and microbiologic (blood culture) evaluation. However, bacteria of the biofilm rarely enter the blood stream as planktonic bacteria, and for this reason the blood culture may be negative when testing for microorganisms [51]. Consequently, immunodiagnostic assays (ELISA) have been developed to detect serum antibodies against biofilm matrix components. For example, an ELISA has been developed to detect antibodies against staphylococcal slime polysaccharide antigens. To date, the ELISA assays developed do not have the sensitivity and specificity to alone determine biofilm-associated infections [49].",

This leads to reduced arterial elasticity, narrowed lumen of the artery, and subsequently to cardiovascular diseases caused by reduced blood flow. In addition, sudden rupture of a plaque may be life threatening [52]. A number of studies, including two recent meta-analyses, show that periodontal disease and cardiovascular disease, including atherosclerosis, are significantly related [53]. Furthermore, oral bacteria have been identified in the atherosclerotic plaques in several studies. However, it is not known whether the bacteria are involved in initiation of plaque formation or colonize the plaques after they are formed. Recently, bacterial biofilms in atherosclerotic arteries have been identified by fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) [54,55]. This may indicate biofilms to be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, and it is hypothesized that the presence of biofilm may contribute to enhanced risk of plaque rupture [55].",

This can cause pain and swelling in about 0.5% of the general population. Earlier studies have suggested that bacteria may be involved in sialolithiasis [56], and new studies now link this to biofilm production. In a descriptive case-control study, sections of submandibular glands with chronic obstructive sialadenitis were compared with those of healthy controls, using confocal laser scanning microscopy [57]. Morphological evidence of bacterial biofilm was observed in half of the histological sections of the chronic obstructive sialadenitis group, whereas no sign of bacterial biofilm formation was seen in the control group. Interestingly, two recent studies report observations of biofilm structures in the center of the stones, thus indicating that biofilm formation may be part of the etiology of salivary stone production [58,59]. Fusconi et al. observed structures resembling bacterial cells embedded in amorphous material, when investigating the stones by scanning electron microscopy [59]. Furthermore, the presence of bacterial DNA was demonstrated by qPCR. In a later study, Kao et al. reported light and scanning electron microscopy observations of biofilm together with host immune cells, platelets, and erythrocytes, as well as calcium nanoparticles [58]. They proposed a hypothesis where biofilm formation leads to local injury, followed by inflammation and calcium deposition.",

Untreated, serious complications may arise, including intestinal bleeding, bowel perforation, septicemia, meningitis, and death [61,62]. There were an estimated 21.7 million cases of typhoid fever worldwide in 2000, resulting in approximately 217,000 deaths [63]. Three to 5% of typhoid fever patients become chronic carriers after the acute phase of the illness [64,65,66]. These chronic carriers are generally asymptomatic and constitute an important reservoir of bacteria that can shed in feces and urine and thereby spread the disease. The chronic carrier state, in which S. Typhi is typically detected in the gall bladder, is often associated with pre-existing hepatobiliary disease and approximately 90% of chronic carriers have gall stones [61,64,67,68]. Complications related to chronic carriage of S. Typhi include hepatitis, cholecystitis, cholangitis, chronic diarrhea, and pancreatitis as well as hepatobiliary carcinomas [62,69]. Antibiotic treatment generally resolves the acute infection, but it is often ineffective against the chronic colonization of the gall bladder by S. Typhi [64,70].",

Typhi, involves attachment and invasion of epithelial cells and biofilm formation on gall stones [48,71,72]. Consistent with this, S. Typhi was observed to cover a large part of the surface of gall stones in patients presenting with colilithiasis and asymptomatic typhoid carriage (Figure 1) [73]. This is in agreement with in vitro studies that showed biofilm formation by S. Typhi on human gall stones, in a medium supplemented with bile [74,75]. Recent studies indicate that both the host and the bacteria adapt to the chronic gall bladder infection. The host immune response changes from an early pro-inflammatory response to a later anti-inflammatory response [76] whereas S. Typhi adapts to the gall bladder environment by increasing the biofilm forming ability and the capacity for persistence and simultaneously reducing the ability to cause acute infections [77,78]. It has also been shown that S. Paratyphi A can persist in the gallbladder [79] and accumulating evidence indicate a role for non-typhoidal Salmonellae in persistent infections. Bacteria, other than salmonellae, can occasionally be detected in gallbladder tissues, but gallstones from these patients are generally not covered by bacterial biofilms [73]. This is consistent with the experiments showing that many bacteria causing acute gallbladder infections do not form biofilms on gallstones in the presence of bile [73,80].",

Mice with diet-induced cholelithiasis had a higher number of Salmonellae associated with the gallbladder epithelium and bile compared to gallstone negative controls and this was associated with increased fecal shedding [72,73]. In addition, biofilms covering approximately half the surface of gall stones that were isolated from mice 21 days post infection were detected by scanning electron microscopy. Using the murine gallstones model Gonzales et al. showed that S. Typhimurium was more resistant to antibiotic treatment in mice fed a cholelithiasis-inducing diet compared to mice fed a standard diet [81]. These experiments mimicking the chronic carrier state support an important role for biofilms in recalcitrance of chronic S. Typhi infections to antibiotic treatment and are consistent with clinical data [70,82,83].",

Furthermore, patients suffering from IBD have a 10\u201330% cumulative risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC) within 30 years after the onset of IBD [87]. IBD has been linked with occurrence of biofilms adhering to the epithelium and dysbiosis of mucosa-associated bacteria that result in stimulation of an inflammatory response. This might be associated with failure of maintaining the integrity of the mucosal barrier resulting in a reduced ability to clear the infection [88]. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and fluorescence microscopy two log higher numbers of bacteria were detected associated with the mucosa of patients with IBD compared to patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS; a disease not generally associated with intestinal inflammation) and healthy controls [89]. In addition, the density of bacteria associated with the mucosa has been shown to be significantly higher in patients with intestinal inflammation [88]. Bacteria adhering to colonic epithelium were detected in IBD patients only, and these biofilms were dominated by Bacteriodes fragilis [89] and Enterobacteriaceae [88]. In contrast, mucosa-associated biofilms with different species composition compared to the IBD associated biofilms were sporadically detected in healthy controls and IBS patients [89]. Several studies have detected higher incidence of Escherichia coli in patients with IBD compared to healthy individuals [90] and although biofilms were not demonstrated in vivo, the isolates were isolated from biopsies after removal of the mucosal layer, indicating adherence to the colonic epithelium and the isolates displayed biofilm forming capacity in vitro [90].",

            "text": "Based on the adenoma-carcinoma model and the accumulating microbiota data, Tjalsma et al. suggested a bacterial driver-passenger model for CRC [95]. In this model, certain bacteria that are part of the normal microbiota can facilitate DNA damage in epithelial cells that may result in initiation of CRC (bacterial drivers). Biological changes that occur during tumorigenesis result in changes of the microenvironment that favor colonization by opportunistic bacteria (bacterial passengers). The new microenvironment provided by the tumor may result in that the bacterial drivers are eventually outcompeted by bacterial passengers [95]. Recent evidence indicates an important role of biofilms in the colorectal carcinogenesis and Li et al. have suggested that biofilms may be regarded as a driver in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence at an early stage of carcinogenesis [85]. It is currently not known exactly how biofilms influences carcinogenesis, if a specific species is responsible or if it is due to sequential or synergistic activities of different members of the microbial community. However, it has been suggested that accumulation of pro-inflammatory species affects the normal processes of the colorectal epithelium leading to disturbed regulation of inflammation, apoptosis, and cell proliferation. In fact, there are a number of species that have been shown to directly affect these processes. Toxigenic B. fragilis has been proposed as an initiator of colorectal cancer due to its ability to disturb the epithelial homeostasis and influence cell proliferation [96,97]. Increased levels of enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) have been detected in tumors and certain strains have been shown to produce toxins that can induce double strand breaks and cause chromosomal instability [97,98]. Simultaneous colonization of tumor prone mice by toxin-producing B. fragilis and E. coli resulted in increased DNA damage, faster initiation of tumorigenesis, and greater mortality compared to mice colonized with either species alone, suggesting a potential link between a tumorigenic microbiota and early neoplasia of the colon [97]. Fusobacterium nucleatum can influence both inflammatory processes and cell proliferation. It is often found enriched in tumor tissues, and high numbers of F. nucleatum correlates with poor prognosis [85,99], however F. nucleatum may not be involved in the early stages of carcinogenesis, but may be involved in cancer progression [100,101].",

Tomkovich et al. recently reported that human colon mucosal biofilms were carcinogenic in murine CRC-models, whether the biofilm associated microbiota were from CRC-patients or healthy individuals [104]. Yu et al. detected biofilms associated with CRC, adenomas, and polyps by SEM, FISH, and fluorescence microscopy and found that the prevalence of F. nucleatum was significantly higher in biofilms from CRC than the other sample groups [105]. Although a connection between the composition of the colorectal microbiota and CRC is becoming increasingly evident, more research is needed to determine the exact role of the microbial community of the biofilm and its constituting species in carcinogenesis.",

Most wounds that contain microorganisms heal successfully. However, sometimes microorganisms, and particularly bacteria, multiply, healing is disrupted and wound tissues are damaged resulting in an infection [106,107]. Both chronic and acute wounds are susceptible to infection as a result of the loss of the innate barrier function of the skin and dermal appendages [108]. It is generally accepted that chronic wound infections harbor several different microorganisms and the number of species are thought to be underestimated because of the limitations in culturing techniques. To circumvent this problem, molecular methods can be used to identify viable, but non-culturable bacteria. Also novel microscopy techniques, like e.g., confocal scanning electron microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, and electron microscopy, can be used both in the visualization and to identify bacteria in wounds [108,109]. Chronic wounds can be colonized with several different bacterial species whereas Staphylococcus aureus is most commonly isolated [110]. Aerobic bacteria, like S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are often found on the surface of chronic wounds while anaerobic species are predominant in deeper tissue [111]. The anaerobic bacteria that predominate chronic wounds of both humans and animals are Bacteroides spp., Fusobacterium spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., as well as Clostridium spp. [108].",

Later, most evidence that wound infections are biofilm related has been shown by different advanced microscopy methods. The study by Bjarnsholt used confocal laser scanning microscopy and a specific peptide nucleic acid- fluorescence in situ hybridization probe to visualize P. aeruginosa biofilm in non-healing chronic wounds [4]. The study by Davis et al. used light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and epifluorescence microscopy to look for biofilm-like structures in biopsies from wounds on pigs infected with S. aureus [112]. A study by James et al. examined biopsies from both acute and chronic wounds using electron microscopy. They found that as many as 60% of chronic wounds contained biofilm, as opposed to only 6% of acute wounds [111]. Lately also an international consensus for clinical indicators of wound infection and biofilm has been published [114]. A total of 14 experts agreed on a list of ten clinical indicators of possible biofilm in a wound, including failure of antibiotic treatment and delayed healing in spite of optimal wound management.",

Currently, it is generally agreed that BV involves the presence of a dense, structured, and polymicrobial biofilm, primarily constituted by G. vaginalis clusters strongly adhered to the vaginal epithelium [116].

Studies by Swidsinski et al. on G. vaginalis in urine, showed that the bacteria were attached to desquamated epithelial cells in all patients with proven BV and their partners, and dispersed when it was present in urine of healthy controls [121]. Furthermore, pathogenic strains displayed higher in vitro phenotypic levels of virulence traits like cytotoxicity, adherence, and biofilm production than commensal strains [122]. This might indicate genetic differences between pathogenic and commensal G. vaginalis strains. However, recent transcriptome studies have suggested that G. vaginalis is able to exhibit different phenotypes through large changes in gene expression [123], and studies on mixed biofilms indicate that expression of G. vaginalis virulence genes may be significantly influenced by other bacterial species in the biofilm [124]. Consequently, the composition of the biofilm may also influence the pathogenesis. Accordingly, Verstraelen and Swidsinski suggest that \u201cenvironmental pressures or ecological disturbances of the vaginal niche might be a more determining factor in biofilm formation and development of bacterial vaginosis in a given woman, than Gardnerella genotype alone\u201d [120].",

In approximately 20% of the women investigated, the bacterial community varied greatly from that of the vagina, suggesting that the endometrial and vaginal microbiota are not necessarily identical [127]. In chronic endometritis (CE), the endometrial mucosa may be colonized by common bacteria like Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli, G. vaginalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus spp., P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus. spp. [128,129].

The bap gene has been identified in up to 25% S. aureus isolates and up to 95% of CNS isolates from bovine mastitis [144,145], and up-regulation of the bap gene with the presence of low concentrations of milk or lactose in the growth medium has been shown in vitro [141,146]. Zuniga et al. studied the presence of genes encoding Bap and a group of adhesins in staphylococci isolated from subclinical mastitis [147]. The median somatic cell counts, which are markers of sub-clinical mastitis, were higher in milk samples where the bacteria had the bap gen and the adhesin genes eno, fnbA, fib, than in samples with staphylococci without these genes. Thus, the presence of biofilm may contribute to a higher intensity of the inflammatory process. In a study on sub-clinical S. aureus mastitis, bap-positive isolates were observed to be more able to colonize and persist in the bovine mammary gland in vivo, and anti-Bap antibodies in the serum confirmed that Bap was produced during infection [146] Interestingly, Bap promoted adhesion and prevented entry of S. aureus into epithelial cells in vitro, whereas Bap deficient bacteria displayed increased invasion into mammary gland epithelial cells in a lactating mice mastitis model [148]. Altogether, these results may indicate that biofilm formation is correlated with persistence of S. aureus in the bovine intramammary gland.",

In mouse models, dispersed bacteria displayed inflammatory infiltration, whereas biofilm pneumococci were quickly cleared from the blood without causing invasive disease [169,170].

When mice were vaccinated with BipA, colonization of the lungs was significantly reduced, and antibodies to BipA were found to opsonize bacteria. Promising results in a murine model have also been obtained with vaccines with other biofilm antigens like BamB and LptD [186].

Microscopic analyses have shown that P. aeruginosa in sputum grows as microcolonies adherent to sputum components [195]. In response to the presence of biofilm, large numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) infiltrate the area, producing a chronic inflammation with subsequent tissue damage, loss of lung function, and obstruction of the airways. The metabolic activity of bacteria and cells consume available oxygen and produce anerobic conditions [195], which unfortunately seems to favor the biofilm mode of P. aeruginosa even more [196].",

Mucoid growth with hyperproduction of alginate by bacteria isolated from lung tissue and sputum is also considered diagnostic for biofilm infection (Figure 4). The presence of alginate in sputum is a good indication. Serum IgG antibodies to P. aeruginosa antigens, including the major biofilm matrix component alginate, is usually present.

            "text": "Bacterial prostatitis (BP) generally presents with urinary tract infection (UTI), pain in the pelvic and genital region, and occurrence of bacteria in expressed prostatic secretions. Acute BP may result in complications such as reduced fertility, bladder infections, prostatic abscesses, urosepsis, and death. The disease can also progress to chronic prostatitis (CP) or chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) [198,199]. If symptoms of bacterial prostatitis last for more than 3 months, it is considered to be chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP). Similar to UTI, the species most commonly associated with BP are E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp. and other Enterobacteriaceae as well as E. faecalis [199,200,201]. Pathogenesis of CBP has been suggested to involve biofilm-forming bacteria [202,203,204,205]. This hypothesis is based on the observations that bacteria can persist in the prostate for long periods of time, a high percentage of cases are refractory to treatment with antibiotics [200,202], and even when the treatment is successful, as judged by negative microbiological tests, symptoms may remain [202]. A few studies support the involvement of biofilm forming bacteria in the pathogenesis of CBP. Nickel et al. used an animal model of experimental BP and showed that chronic symptoms correlated with the presence of glycocalyx-enclosed bacterial microcolonies inside the ducts and acini of the prostate [206]. Occurrence of microcolonies seemed to be associated with a chronic inflammation of the gland. In support of this finding; scanning electron microscopy of prostate calcifications from patients with CBP showed structures reminiscent of bacterial microcolonies on the surface of, and embedded in, the calcifications [205,207]. These observations were associated with isolation of bacteria, from the surface of calcifications, with the potential to form biofilms in vitro [207]. In addition, prostatitis appears to be correlated with occurrence in urine of E. coli with high capacity to form biofilm in vitro [203,204]. However, biofilm formation may not be the only explanation for persistent bacterial infections in the prostate. Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) strains, which are often isolated from BP-patients, can invade prostate cells in a mouse model (NOD and C57BL/6J mice) as well as in cultured RWPE-1 and PEC-1 cell lines [208,209]. In the mouse model, the UPEC strains were able to proliferate within the epithelial cells following invasion, and although the effect was strain dependent, the infection could induce and sustain pelvic pain in the NOD mice [209]. UPEC strains can also invade bladder epithelial cells, proliferate and form matrix-enclosed biofilm-like structures that has been referred to as intracellular bacterial communities (IBC) [210,211]. Interestingly, the invasive capacity of different UPEC strains into the prostate cell line RWPE-1 correlated with both the ability to adhere to epithelial cells and the capacity to form biofilm on a plastic surface, in vitro [208] and similar results were observed with an adherent/invasive E. coli (AIEC) strain, which is highly similar to UPEC, isolated from an ileal lesion in a Crohn\u2019s disease patient [212]. It is therefore possible, but to our knowledge has not been demonstrated, that bacteria can persist in the prostate using a similar strategy. More research is needed to understand the pathogenesis of chronic bacterial prostatitis and if bacterial persistence involves biofilm formation.",

Symptoms depend on the anatomical location of the infection and generally include urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, and/or pain in the lower abdominal region. Systemic symptoms and sepsis may occur, especially in infections involving the kidneys. A urinary tract infection often clears up on its own within a few days or after a short course of antibiotic treatment, but the relapse rate is high. The etiology of these chronic, or recurrent, urinary tract infections is not fully understood and has been attributed to reintroduction of bacteria via the rectal-peritoneal route, or from a vaginal reservoir. However, a growing body of evidence suggests involvement of a persistent infection in the bladder due to IBC [213,214,215,216,217,218,219].",

Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy combined with fluorescently labeled bacteria and specific staining methods for type I fimbriae and polysaccharides revealed large protrusions on the urothelium which consisted of bacterial populations surrounded by a matrix of polysaccharide and fimbrial proteins that were not localized to specific organelles [210]. These results indicate bacterial biofilm formation inside the bladder epithelial cells. IBC can facilitate bacterial immune evasion as shown by video microscopy where luminal bacteria of the bladder were consumed by neutrophils whereas bacteria that had invaded the epithelial cells were protected from neutrophil attack and could proliferate in the IBC [220]. In the mouse model, UPEC undergo three-stage cycles of invasion of epithelial cells, followed by proliferation as IBC and dispersion into the bladder lumen, which allows for a new round of infection of adjacent cells [220]. This mechanism could explain persistent UTI with periods of quiescent and relapsing infections.",

Biofilm formation increases the bacteria\u2019s resistance against the defense mechanisms of the body, as well as antimicrobial treatments, thereby promoting chronic infections. Biofilms may also function as an environment that accumulate different bacterial species as well as bacterial numbers in certain locations. This can result in deleterious effects on host cells due to concentrated, sequential, and/or synergistic activities by the present bacteria. Furthermore, the mere presence of persistent biofilms may modulate the local immune response in several ways, e.g., by stimulating a local inflammatory response that can cause or aggravate tissue damage. These biofilm-mediated mechanisms have also been suggested to be involved in initiation and/or progression of cancers, such as CRC. In wounds, an additional effect of biofilm is that the physical presence may obstruct wound healing. Biofilm might also facilitate cellular invasion by pathogens, as indicated by the observed link between intracellular S. aureus and biofilm colonization in the upper airways. Interestingly, biofilm-like intracellular bacterial communities have been identified, e.g., within the epithelial cells of the bladder of the urinary tract, which appears to result in bacterial immune evasion and persistent or recurrent infections.",
