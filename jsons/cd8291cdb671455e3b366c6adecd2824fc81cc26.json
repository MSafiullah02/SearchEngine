However, the current article is a preliminary analysis and modeling was done using the data available as of March 9, 2020. These data do not represent the pandemic in its entire scale; such data will need to be reevaluated when the pandemic is completely controlled. However, our predictions for underreporting as of March 9 in a couple of European countries were close to the reported number of COVID-19 cases as more cases surfaced from March 9 to March 16, 2020. Wavelets of reported cases and adjusted estimates with the underreported cases are shown in Figure 1 .

Furthermore, we considered daily new cases (>10) up to the first reported peak of COVID-19 cases and the corresponding date ranges for all the countries for which such data were available. This range of days varied between 8 and 16 days (Table 1) . We use 2 coupled differential equations and the United States: 0.75 and 1.5. The difference between model-predicted numbers and the actual numbers reported within the range were treated as underreported, which includes underdiagnosed cases. We constructed the Meyer wavelets for the reported and adjusted data after adjusting the infected number in the population for underreporting.

We also had no clear idea of the duration that SARS-CoV-2 virus remains active on nonliving surfaces such as plastics, metals, paper, etc; thus, we did not consider the interaction between humans and nonliving surfaces. Mathematical modeling can be made more complex by adding more parameters, but caution is necessary to ensure that these studies are well designed and that these parameters use readily available, scientifically collected data. Once we obtain more data on the duration of COVID-19 living on nonliving surfaces, we can build more complex models with more parameters.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 136, "end": 145, "text": "Krantz. 9", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Data, Methods, and Models"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "WHO situational report-49", "authors": [], "year": 2020, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Identification of COVID-19 can be quicker through artificial intelligence framework using a mobile phone-based survey in the populations when cities and towns are under quarantine", "authors": [{"first": "Asrs", "middle": [], "last": "Rao", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Vazquez", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2020, "venue": "Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {"DOI": ["10.1017/ice.2020.61"]}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Nowcasting and forecasting the potential domestic and international spread of the 2019-nCoV outbreak originating in Wuhan, China: a modelling study", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": ["T"], "last": "Wu", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Leung", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Leung", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2020, "venue": "Lancet", "volume": "395", "issn": "", "pages": "689--697", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "True epidemic growth construction through harmonic analysis", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": ["G"], "last": "Krantz", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": ["G"], "last": "Polyakov", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Asrs", "middle": [], "last": "Rao", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2020, "venue": "J Theoret Biol", "volume": "494", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {"DOI": ["10.1016/j.jtbi.2020.110243"]}}, "BIBREF5": {"ref_id": "b5", "title": "Understanding theoretically the impact of reporting of disease cases in epidemiology", "authors": [{"first": "Asrs", "middle": [], "last": "Rao", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2012, "venue": "J Theoret Biol", "volume": "302", "issn": "", "pages": "89--95", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF6": {"ref_id": "b6", "title": "Underreporting and case fatality estimates for emerging epidemics", "authors": [{"first": "E", "middle": [], "last": "Atkins Katherine", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Wenzel", "middle": [], "last": "Natasha", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Ndeffo-Mbah", "middle": [], "last": "Martial", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2015, "venue": "BMJ", "volume": "350", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF7": {"ref_id": "b7", "title": "Modelling underreporting in epidemics", "authors": [{"first": "K", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Gamado", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": [], "last": "Streftaris", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Zachary", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2014, "venue": "J Math Biol", "volume": "69", "issn": "", "pages": "737--765", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF8": {"ref_id": "b8", "title": "A Panorama of Harmonic Analysis.
