            "text": "Vaccine development was considered as the most important subjects to protect from a highly infectious disease especially when treatment is not available; nowadays, a new way for vaccine design was done by a new aspects called immune-informatics that depends on software program to determine the most immunogenic parts of the organisms (epitopes) like these software that were used in this study to try to develop more powerful immunogenic MERS-CoV vaccine because the previous MERS-CoV vaccine can be either inactivated coronavirus, live attenuated coronavirus, S protein-based, DNA vaccines, and combination vaccines against coronaviruses; as we know coronaviruses were first described in the 1960s from the nasal cavities of patients with common cold. These strains of coronaviruses were called HC-229E and HC-OC43; in 2003, following the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that resulted in over 8000 infections, about 10% of which resulted in death, but in 24 September 2012, a first report of isolated new novel coronavirus like SARS-CoV by Egyptian virologist Dr. Ali Mohamed Zaki in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, from the lungs of a 60-year-old male patient with acute pneumonia and acute renal failure becomes a new discovery that was recently called MERS-CoV; this finding was posted on ProMED-mail [1\u20133]. MERS-CoV belong to group C \u03b2-coronaviruses that characterize 30 KB genome, ssRNA virus, positive sense with 10 predicting open reading frames (ORFs) like E, M, S, enveloped. MERS-CoV can grow in a culture media; the genome size, organization, and sequence analysis revealed that the NCoV is most closely related to bat coronaviruses BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5; a partial spike gene sequencing of South African Neoromicia bats was considered as close relative to MERS-Cov as illustrated by nucleotide percentage distance substitution model and the complete deletion option in MEGA; this makes the possibility of a common coronavirus vaccine more desirable [3\u20135].",
