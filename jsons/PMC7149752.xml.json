In addition to indirectly electing the State Council, the NPC can also dismiss the holders of the top offices of state. The Standing Committee of the NPC, which is further composed of a series of special committees and working and administrative bodies (see Figure 5.1\n) is empowered to modify legislation between plenary sessions of, and carry out the daily work of, the NPC on a more permanent basis. In practice, although its scrutiny role has been enhanced in recent years and unanimous votes have become less frequent, the independent power of the NPC remains limited.2\n",

The party\u2019s alliance with the rich is just as tight.

Many successful entrepreneurs have also been party members.

In June 2009, after receiving complaints from local villagers that the land has not been developed according to its intended use (i.e., the construction of economically affordable apartments), a reporter went to Zhengzhou for an interview with Lu Jun, deputy Bureau Director of Zhengzhou Planning Bureau. Mr Lu interrogated the reporter: \u2018Why doesn\u2019t your radio station mind its own business? Who do you speak for, the Party or the people?\u2019It is well known that the land planning bureau controls the lifeline for developers to get rich, so it has become the area hardest hit by corruption. In the planning of urban construction, some corrupt officials have become the developer\u2019s spokesmen in the government because they are bribed by the developers.

China has now entered this stage, and it still remains unclear how this will affect the Chinese economy and society in the long term. At present, the Chinese government has tried to manage popular discontent by implementing various programs that could quickly address early signs of unrest, such as re-employment centers for unemployed workers, migration programs aimed at lowering regional disparities, and improvement of infrastructure, health care, and education in rural areas.
