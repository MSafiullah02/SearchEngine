Diagnosis of respiratory infection is usually based on clinical and epidemiological criteria, with only severe cases being confirmed by pathogen detection; hence, data for patients admitted to hospital remain limited, the one partial exception being the influenza virus [Mangtani et al., 2006; Elliot et al., 2008; Schanzer et al., 2008; van den Dool et al., 2008; Ison, 2009]. In order to evaluate the costs and benefits of molecular diagnosis, there is a need for better definition of the prevalence of common respiratory viruses [Gilca et al., 2009].",

However, few studies have been conducted in adult patients attending emergency departments to estimate the burden of respiratory infections from HRV compared with other respiratory viruses. In our previous study [Pierangeli et al., 2010], we showed that triage criteria based on case definitions of influenza\u2010like illness did not lead to the identification of all patients infected with the influenza virus and also included patients who were HRV\u2010positive.",

Conversely, most patients over 65 years with HRV were diagnosed with severe respiratory conditions that led to high rates of hospitalization similar to those from other respiratory virus infections. Patients over 65 years who were HRV\u2010positive presented with abnormal chest X\u2010rays with consolidation statistically less frequently than elderly patients who were virus\u2010negative, most of whom suffered from bacterial pneumonia; however, abnormal chest X\u2010ray results in patients who were HRV\u2010positive did not differ significantly from those of other virus\u2010positive patients. Overall, in patients aged over 65 years of age, HRV and the other respiratory virus infections contributed to about half of the diagnoses of dyspnoea and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease acute exacerbation; notably, HRV was the most frequent single agent detected in these diagnoses, as reported in previous papers [McManus et al., 2008; Kherad et al., 2010].",

The inclusion of HRV in the virological diagnostic work\u2010up of respiratory specimens may greatly increase virus detection frequency in acute and chronic respiratory tract diseases, without real clinical significance. Indeed, a positive PCR for HRV does not necessarily indicate an association with the overt disease, especially in younger adults, as evident in our group of 18\u201365 year\u2010olds. However, the potential for HRV diffusion to frail patients should be considered, as emergency departments are important sites of pathogen transmission.

As reported in this and other studies, HRV infection may resemble clinically an influenza\u2010like illness [Monto et al., 2001; Pierangeli et al., 2010] and HRV cases might well confound syndromic surveillance. HRV was the most common virus detected in samples collected during the recent pandemic H1N1 2009 virus testing [Follin et al., 2009]. In addition, national surveillance of influenza in Sweden and France resulted in an alert for pandemic H1N1 influenza A circulation during the early weeks of September 2009 due to an increased incidence of influenza\u2010like illnesses, the increase actually due to HRV infection [Linde et al., 2009; Casalegno et al., 2010].

            "text": "Overall, results from this study showed that HRV is a major viral infection in adults seeking medical care for respiratory conditions in emergency departments, presenting with no obvious distinguishing clinical features and causing respiratory distress and lower respiratory tract illnesses in older patients. Virological diagnosis of respiratory infections should, whenever needed, include molecular tests for HRV, as this virus has a significant healthcare impact, being associated frequently with admission to hospital of the elderly.",
