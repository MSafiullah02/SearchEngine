            "text": "Sex segregation in the workforce is commonplace but varies throughout the world. In Canada and the United States, men continue to hold most positions in the primary and secondary industries, such as logging, fishing, and manufacturing, whereas women hold most of the jobs in the service industries, including health care, retail, and clerical sectors [6], [7]. Although it may be assumed that this segregation in the workplace clusters men in \u201chigh-risk\u201d jobs such as mining and smelting, in actuality, women are exposed routinely to hazardous materials on the job, even in those industries that are considered to be \u201csafe.\u201d Stellman [8] reported that women commonly are exposed to a large number of carcinogenic substances in the workplace. She identified 46 different carcinogens that were used commonly in industries that employed a minimum of 25,000 women in the United States in 1992, including the service and the health care industries. Many other hazardous chemicals and agents have been found in other occupational environments where a large proportion of women are employed (Table 1)\n. The workplace environment continues to change for women, as there has been a shift toward more women being employed in traditionally \u201cmale\u201d occupations and vice versa.",

            "text": "Although it is recognized that men and women are exposed to different occupational hazards because of their segregation in the workforce, less attention has been paid to differing exposures between men and women who have the same job title. Segregation of task by gender can occur in the workplace which results in differing exposures between men and women with the same job title [9]. For example, Messing and colleagues [10] reported that male cleaners who worked in the railway industry often were assigned different tasks than female cleaners. Female cleaners consistently were assigned to toilet-cleaning tasks, whereas male cleaners were responsible for floor mopping. The women worked in closer proximity to the cleaning fumes compared to men, resulting in different levels of exposure. In a different study, Messing et al [11] reported that male and female gardeners who were employed by city hall in a Quebec municipality were assigned different tasks, either because of personal choice or the lack of appropriate-sized equipment for women. In a recent study of university employees, women reported more physical and malaise symptoms than their male counterparts in the same job [12]. There were no gender differences after controlling for occupation grade, perceived working conditions, and orientation to gender roles. The investigators concluded that differential exposure, rather than differential vulnerability, influenced the gender differences in health. These studies show that job classification alone often is a poor proxy for exposure. A woman may be assigned to different tasks with different exposures compared with men, or her work environment may differ from other workers in different industries that have the same job title. For example, a woman whose job is classified as \u201csecretary\u201d may be employed in a sawmill and be exposed to levels of wood dust or wood antigens that are sufficiently high to elicit a lung response.",

Finally, differences in the size, surface area, and design of equipment and machinery may have an impact on exposure levels, particularly if the breathing zone is in close proximity to the sources of exposure. The impact of sex differences in ergonomics was demonstrated in musculoskeletal injury research [14], [15], [16] but its importance in the development of occupational lung disease is not known.",

            "text": "To prevent toxins and other occupational hazards from being inhaled by the worker, personal protective equipment or other barriers often are required for use in the workplace. Nevertheless, gender can impact how much of the toxin passes the protective equipment barrier and enters the protected environment. Personal protective equipment, such as gloves or respirators, may not be designed to fit a woman's body; this may result in an increased exposure. Greenberg and Dement [1] identified this problem as a potential confounder in occupational health research and noted that although it was recognized as a problem as early as 1942 [17], little research has been done to determine the impact of improperly-fitting protective equipment on women's occupational health. A Korean study of three commonly-used respirators found decreased fit factors (indicating less protection) among women compared with men, even after taking differences in facial dimensions into account [18]. In addition, the education on, and use of, protective equipment or other safety training may be impacted by gender. Women are more likely to be employed on a part-time or temporary basis [19], [20], which may result in fewer opportunities for adequate training in personal protective practices. It also may be more physically demanding for women to wear protective equipment compared with men. Murphy et al [21] reported that compared with men, women experienced a greater increase in percent of VO2max and rating of perceived exertion while wearing chemical protective clothing (compared with wearing regular clothing) and engaging in continuous activity. This greater increase in energy cost while wearing protective clothing may provide a disincentive to women, especially if it affects a woman's capacity to perform in a male-dominated work environment.",

Aerosol deposition, however, may be enhanced on average in women because of higher airway flow rates [23]. It also is possible that sex differences in clearance mechanisms may exist and result in differing levels of applied dose; however, these do not seem to have been well explored.

If men and women who have occupational lung disease are identified based on compensation claims, gender differences in claim success could bias the results. This was shown by Lippel [25] for chronic stress claims; in a sample of 185 compensation applications, women who applied for chronic stress claims were significantly less likely to have their claim accepted by a review board than men. In contrast, a Canadian study showed that the relative proportion of men and women was consistent across the three claim categories of \u201cconfirmed occupational asthma,\u201d \u201cnonoccupational asthma,\u201d or \u201cno asthma\u201d [26]; this suggested no gender difference in claim success.",

The evidence that exists must be evaluated with these weaknesses in mind. We now turn to the review of the scientific literature on the impact of occupational lung disease on women workers, with a specific emphasis on the diseases that have caused considerable mortality and morbidity among women workers worldwide. In the next section we outline the current knowledge of the impact of silicosis, asbestosis, occupational lung cancer, occupational asthma, and other respiratory signs and symptoms in women workers in North America and abroad. Excluded from this section is a discussion of byssinosis, a disease that has affected a large number of women workers in cotton production worldwide because this was reviewed recently elsewhere [30].",

Crystalline silica is abundant in many types of stone, such as sandstone, granite, or shale [31] or can be converted from noncrystalline silica in several manufacturing processes. Exposure to heavy amounts of dust over a long time period is necessary to develop chronic silicosis. The clinical symptoms of dyspnea, cough, and sputum production often are not present until the disease is advanced. In the absence of regular screening, it is likely that silicosis is underdiagnosed. Historically, excessive silica exposure was considered to be confined to certain industries, namely metal and coal mining and foundries [32] that traditionally hired a high proportion of male employees. United States' regulations regarding the permissible levels of silica exposures were based upon research done in the 1920s and 1930s on male workers in the Vermont granite industry. Silica also is present in high levels in the ceramic industry, which employs large numbers of female workers.",

They concluded that an association between duration of exposure and silicosis was similar between the women in their study and a similar population of men in another study; however, the men demonstrated more severe disease with fewer years of exposure.

They also compared female workers from the pottery industry with male workers in the quartz processing industry, who were considered to have a high risk for silica exposure. Female workers had a higher rate of progression of disease, despite working in an environment that had supposed lower rates of exposure. This study generated data from an occupational disease registry without individual contact with the workers. It is not clear how the tasks that the men and women performed differed, and whether this resulted in different levels of dust exposure.

Asbestosis usually occurs after exposures over many years to high levels of dust, with a latency period of 20 years or more.

Seventy-four percent of the women had begun working in the mines before they were 24 years old; the majority (60%) had worked in the mines for 10 years or less.

Exposure duration (mean 22 years in men; 18 years in women) was associated with decreased lung function in male workers but not in female workers. Their data suggested that radiographic parenchymal abnormalities were more closely associated with reduced lung function in women compared with men and pleural abnormalities were more strongly associated with reduced lung function in men. Because few women had pleural abnormalities, this finding could not be explored in sufficient detail.

Lung cancer due to exposure to dry cleaning fluids were investigated by Brownson et al [49] who found a significant risk for lung cancer (OR 2.9; confidence interval 1.5\u20135.4) although an earlier study by Katz and Jowett [50] did not demonstrate this risk. Workers who are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke also have elevated risks for respiratory cancers. For instance, Dimich-Ward et al [51] found elevated proportionate mortality ratios for lung cancer among bartenders, waiters, and waitresses. A California study of occupational mortality in women found that waitresses have high risks for lung cancer (standardized mortality ratio: 368) [52]. A standardized incidence ratio of 2.3 for lung cancer was observed in study of a large cohort of waitresses in Norway [53]. Smoking is an important confounder; however, a review by Siegel [54] found that when personal smoking habits and other confounders were controlled for, there was a 50% excess of lung cancer on average (range 10%\u201390%) among restaurant workers.",

Their study involved 1247 white men, 1229 white women, and 546 black men who were employed in various sectors of a South Carolina textile factory. They found higher standardized-mortality ratios (SMRs) for white men compared with white women or black men for every disease analyzed, including all cancers and respiratory disease. Gender differences in follow-up explained much of the apparent difference in mortality. Although only 1.5% of the white men had an unknown vital status at the end of the study period, 22.8% of the white women were in this category. When the analysis corrected for the missing data, the SMRs for all causes of death and for lung cancer in white women increased from a statistically significant deficit to a statistically significant increased risk associated with asbestos exposure. The investigators reported that women had work histories of short duration and the lack of accurate follow-up likely underestimated the SMRs compared with men.",

With hundreds of probable or possible carcinogens linked to lung cancer, identifying unique susceptibilities by gender is problematic. Nevertheless, researchers have identified that differences may exist between men and women in the type of lung cancer that is diagnosed. A European study reported that among women who have lung cancer, adenocarcinoma has the highest incidence, whereas among men who have lung cancer, squamous cell and adenocarcinoma are distributed equally [56]. A United States study concluded that in most histologic subgroups of lung cancer, the risk ratios for both sexes are converging [57].

This wide range is likely due to differences in reporting practices. Nevertheless, it was suggested that OA is the most prevalent occupational respiratory disease in most developed countries [62]. Gender differences in OA were reported but it is difficult to identify a clear pattern of susceptibility to disease and expression of disease by gender. Gender differences in nonoccupational asthma [63] and bronchial hyperresponsiveness [64], [65], [66] were reported; it may not be possible to sort out those aspects of asthma that are related uniquely to occupational exposures and moderated by gender. In some countries, the prevalence of OA is higher in men [67], [68], but in others, the rates seem to be similar [69], [70]. In the United Kingdom, surveillance data suggested higher rates in men than women; however, when the occupation was taken into consideration the rates were similar in both sexes [71]. Higher rates in men may be attributed to a larger proportion of men being employed in high-risk occupations; nevertheless, women are exposed to many OA-inducing agents and may show different manifestations of disease.",

Women are disproportionately employed as cleaners in many industries and are responsible for a disproportionate share of cleaning tasks in the household. Kogevinas estimated that 5% of the asthma risk in women could be attributed definitively to household exposure. This \u201cdouble-shift\u201d phenomenon, where women are exposed to cleaning products at work and at home, may not be captured adequately in the data.

The analysis of 18,277 participants in a European Community Respiratory Health Survey showed that women were more likely to report nocturnal and nonproductive cough [83]. Possible explanations given include physiologic differences (females have more sensitive cough receptors), hormonal differences (female sex hormones can affect airway smooth muscle and bronchial hyperresponsiveness), and possible gender bias that are due to differences in reporting. According to the review by Becklake and Kauffmann [5] shortness of breath is reported more frequently and consistently by women in population-based studies.

A large section of this article was devoted to describing the methodologic challenges that face researchers when evaluating gender differences in occupational lung disease. The findings of the presented studies are likely limited by many of the methodologic problems that were identified earlier. To accurately identify the true risk of occupational lung disease in women workers, these findings must be replicated in future studies with special attention paid to the various aspects of occupational lung disease research that are susceptible to gender-related bias.",
