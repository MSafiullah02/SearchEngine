Pre-triage executed the epidemic investigation and patient diversion. The red zone comprised of two parts: red zone 1 and red zone 2. Red zone 1 includes four private indoor negative-pressure isolation rooms, with inbound doors next to the entrance of our ED, fully equipped with O 2 supply and monitors for patients at high risk or possibly infected patients with unstable conditions. Red zone 2 includes an outdoor fever screening station (one room and four tents, including the physician's office room with air conditioning, laboratory and portable X-ray machine, patient waiting area, swab inspection tent, and personal protective equipment removal tent) for processing patients with minor symptoms, potential exposures, or mass screening, who need throat swab survey. The yellow zone is a separate area inside the ED that serves as a buffer zone dealing with bed-waiting patients diagnosed with lung infiltration on chest radiographs or pneumonia, without travel, occupation, contact, cluster (TOCC) history, and who may not be screened immediately in the ED. As the healthcare workers transition between the zones, hand disinfection with 75% alcohol is performed at each step. Each transition point is clearly delineated with signage and door, and each zone includes prominently posted descriptions of the steps to be taken there.",
