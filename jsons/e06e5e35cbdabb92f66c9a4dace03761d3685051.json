We considered what ventilation technique is the most beneficial in this case. A hybrid (numerical-physical) simulator of infant respiratory system mechanics, the Bennett Ventilator and NICO apparatus were used to simulate pressure-controlled ventilation (PC) and volume-controlled ventilation with constant flow (VCV CF ) and descending flow (VCV DF ), under permissive hypercapnia (PHC) (6 ml kg \u22121 ) and normocapnia (SV) (8 ml kg \u22121 ) conditions. Respiratory rate (RR) was 36 or 48 min \u22121 and PEEP was 0.3 or 0.6 kPa. Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), mean airway pressure (MAP), and work of breathing by the ventilator (WOB) were lower (P < 0.01, 1 \u2212 \u03b2 = 0.9) using the PHC strategy compared to the SV strategy. The WOB increased (P < 0.01; 1 \u2212 \u03b2 = 0.9) when the RR increased. The PC, VCV CF , and VCV DF modes did not differ in minute ventilation produced by the ventilator (MV V ), but the PC mode delivered the highest minute ventilation to the patient (MV T ) (P < 0.01; 1 \u2212 \u03b2 = 0.9) at the same PIP, MAP, and WOB. The most beneficial ventilation technique appeared to be PC ventilation with the PHC strategy, with lower RR (36 min \u22121 ).",

Barotrauma is lung tissue damage caused when the pressure provided to patient's airway is too high. By VILI, we mean volume injury to the lungs leading to morphological and physiological lung changes [6] . Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common chronic lung disease of preterm infants which develops as a consequence of mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy influencing immature lungs [22] , causing airway remodeling, fibrosis, bronchial epithelium hyperplasia, lung field heterogeneity, and abnormal lung maturation [8, 19, 29] . Permissive hypercapnia (PHC) is gaining ground in the ongoing discussion of infant lung protective ventilation. The strategy consists in keeping the CO 2 arterial partial pressure higher than normal (i.e., P a CO 2 > 40 mmHg (5.3 kPa)). It is applied to decrease the risk of VILI and chronic lung diseases [6, 21, 27] . It may protect against hypocapnia-induced brain hypoperfusion and subsequent periventricular leukomalacia and improve patient outcome [23] , e.g., of infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) [10] . According to a survey carried out in the USA a few years ago, 97% of neonatologists (of the 747 surveyed) were using PHC in their clinical practice [21] . Although PHC has clinical utility, caution must be taken to keep PaCO 2 in the safe range: 45-55 mmHg (6-7.3 kPa) on the first day of infant life and 55-65 mmHg (7.3-8.7 kPa) thereafter. Elevated PaCO 2 levels cause an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage [28, 30] . PHC may also worsen white matter development in extremely low birth weight preterm infants (ELBW) [23] . Because of this risk, there is no general recommendation to use PHC in preterm infants [27] . However, the association between BPD, barotrauma, and volutrauma led to the use of PHC as a therapy to minimize lung injury [8] in preterm infants.",

Until recently, the use of volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) in preterm infants was a controversial issue, due to poor accuracy-a discrepancy between the volume of air reaching the patient's lungs (V T ) and the volume generated by the ventilator (V V ) (Eq. 1) [9] . The discrepancy is due to circuit compliance (C V ) creating dead space in the breathing circuit (V DC ) and tidal volume being determined from flow measured close to the expiratory valve (in-ventilator) [9, 18] . However, only the most modern ventilators determine tidal volume from flow measured at patient airways [18] .",

This impairs normal breathing and makes mechanical ventilation difficult in preterm infants [1, 11, 17] . Even though antenatal steroids and natural or synthetic surfactant administration after birth can increase lung compliance, it still remains comparable to circuit compliance [16] . The problem of the circuit compliance is extremely important when applying permissive hypercapnia as a lung protective ventilation method in preterm infants, due to the necessity of keeping the P a CO 2 level in the safe range [1, 15, 27] .",

This can be a surprisingly large value in relation to patient's respiratory system compliance. It means that accurate compensation for the circuit compliance is necessary [9] , or optionally, the influence of the circuit compliance on flow measurement should be accounted for in some way [3, 18] . Most modern ventilators are equipped with special algorithms for circuit compliance compensation. They incorporate the contribution of circuit compliance to calculated expired tidal volume, utilizing circuit compliance determined by a pre-use self-test and actual measurement of pressure changes in the circuit. However, there are some crucial points in the compensation procedure [3, 9, 15, 18] , which make the procedure ineffective in some conditions. These points are as follows: (1) ventilator circuit layout, its length and shape during pre-use self-test [9] ; (2) the placement of flow sensors in the ventilator circuit, which influences the accuracy of tidal volume delivered to the patient [3, 18] ; (3) the influence of heaters, humidifiers, water traps, and other equipment of the ventilator circuit [3] ; and finally, (4) successive ventilation modes of the ventilator can differ in effectiveness of compensation [15] .",

[9] , to determine the correct circuit compliance and to entirely compensate for the dead space created by it when ventilating an infant weighing less than 10 kg, it is important to do a self-test with a circuit expanded as it is during patient ventilation. The reason for this is that the compliance of the expanded circuit is significantly higher than the compliance of a nonexpanded circuit. If the pre-use self-test is done with a nonexpanded circuit, the tidal volume displayed on the ventilator monitor can significantly overestimate the tidal volume delivered to the infant.",

It appeared that pressurecontrolled ventilation is more effective than volumecontrolled ventilation in reaching the targeted tidal volume and minute ventilation. This means that, under PCV, the required minute ventilation can be obtained more easily, with lower levels of PIP, MAP, and WOB. Thus, PCV of preterm infants with very low respiratory system compliance seems to be more \"lung protective\" than VCV. This agrees with data on ventilation of preterm infants in the literature [1, 5, 7] . For example, in the Masselli et al. paper [15] , PCV and VCV were compared to determine which is more effective in compensating for breathing circuit compressible volume. This study showed that the PCV resulted in a more reliable compensation of dead space created by circuit compliance. Similarly, our results indicated that tidal volumes set on the ventilator were closer to those actually delivered to the patient during PCV.",

However, if circulatory system failure accompanies respiratory acidosis, it can lead to metabolic acidosis (HCO 3 < 20 mmol/l and pH < 7.35) and the pH decreases as a result of hyperlactatemia and alkali deficiency. As a compensation for acidosis, pulmonary vasoconstriction with risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension, saturation decrease, and WOB increase can occur.

The most accurate method to determine P a CO 2 level is blood gasometry (as well as measuring pH). End-tidal CO 2 monitoring or transcutaneous CO 2 (tcCO 2 ) measurements enable the continuous noninvasive measurement of CO 2 values [2, 13] . The former, based on the CO 2 partial pressure measurement at the end of exhalation (P et CO 2 ), facilitates the control of CO 2 values within the safe range during conventional ventilation under PHC [13] . However, this method is not reliable or accurate enough in some cases, for example, in the case of a leak due to an uncuffed tube, if the side-stream method is used, or under HFV. More recently, the latter method, based on CO 2 diffusion by body tissue and skin, has been shown to provide more accuracy. Additionally, it helps to reduce the frequency of blood sampling in extremely preterm infants [2] .",

For this reason, PHC should not to be applied in patients with cerebral edema and elevated intracranial pressure [10, 27] . Nonetheless, in most patients, mild hypercapnia seems to be safer than lung damage (which may occur at higher pressures and volumes during SV) or hypocapnia (leading to periventricular leukomalacia and distant neurologic deficits) [27] .",
