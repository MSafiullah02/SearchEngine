            "text": "The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is currently mainly based on clinical features (Tolosa et al., 2006), i.e. the presence of bradykinesia in combination with muscle rigidity, resting tremor or postural instability, the absence of symptoms that indicate atypical parkinsonian disorders and supporting findings including a positive effect of dopaminergic medication (Hughes et al., 1992). Despite these clear criteria, diagnosing PD can be difficult, especially in its early stages. In particular, essential tremor and atypical parkinsonian syndromes such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) may initially mimic PD. The positive predictive value of the final clinical diagnosis of idiopathic PD made by movement disorder specialists was demonstrated to be very high, 98.6% (Hughes et al., 2002). However, in the same study, almost one third of the clinical diagnoses in patients with parkinsonism had been revised in on average the first five years of the disease (Hughes et al., 2002). Diagnostic accuracy in the early stages of the disease is important for the patient and, moreover, facilitates evaluation of future neuroprotective therapies. To improve the accuracy of the early diagnosis of PD, biomarkers are urgently needed. Biomarkers can be defined as characteristics that are objectively measured as indicators of normal and pathogenetic processes or responses to a therapeutic intervention. Examples of biomarkers for PD are imaging markers such as striatal dopamine transporter binding measured using single photon emission computed tomography (DaT-SPECT) or clinical markers of disease including measurement of non-motor functions such as sense of smell or autonomic function. Proteins in csf and/or blood may also serve as biomarkers for PD, but are not yet used in clinical practice. Ideally, biomarkers should be sensitive, reproducible, closely associated with the disease process, easy to measure, inexpensive, non-invasive and thoroughly validated (Michell et al., 2004). Biomarkers fulfilling all of these criteria have not yet been identified for PD.",

            "text": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a potential source of PD biomarkers in living patients, because it is in direct contact with the diseased brain. Specific proteins play a major role in the pathogenesis of PD and brain-derived CSF proteins are therefore promising candidate biomarkers. However, the majority of the CSF proteins are believed to originate from the blood rather than directly from the surrounding brain tissue. These blood-derived proteins enter the CSF at the choroid plexus and along the flow of the CSF from the ventricles to the subarachnoid space (Huhmer et al., 2006). As a consequence, the concentration of blood-derived proteins differs between ventricular and lumbar CSF (Reiber, 1994). In addition to blood-derived proteins, brain tissue proteins contribute to the CSF pool. A recent proteomics study reported that almost 10% of identified CSF proteins overlapped with proteins detected in frontal cortex tissue of human subjects (Pan et al., 2007). Vice versa, in the same study more than 20% of the proteins detected in frontal cortex tissue were detectable in the CSF (Pan et al., 2007). Brain tissue proteins that are not detectable in CSF may either not diffuse into the CSF because they are for example membrane bound (Mogi et al., 1996a), or they may be internally recycled in brain tissue, form insoluble aggregates, or their levels may be too low to be detected (Shi et al., 2009). The total protein concentration in CSF obtained by lumbar puncture is about 200 times lower than in blood plasma (Huhmer et al., 2006) and normally varies between 150 and 500 mg/L. Because of the relatively high concentration of proteins in blood, blood contamination during lumbar puncture can have a significant effect on the CSF proteome (Hong et al., 2010). The CSF protein concentration is further influenced by the effect of circadian rhythms on the CSF secretion rate, the maximum of which at 02.00 h is 3.5 times higher than its minimum at 18.00 h (Nilsson et al., 1992). These pre-analytical factors may profoundly influence protein levels which emphasizes the importance of standardized protocols for CSF collection (Teunissen et al., 2009).",

For a better understanding of the results, we first briefly review the currently leading hypotheses about PD pathogenesis and discuss the proteins that play a role in these pathogenetic processes. Promising candidate CSF biomarkers are selected based upon their relationship with the pathogenesis of PD and their different expression levels compared to controls in both CSF and brain tissue. We discuss the challenges encountered in the search for sensitive and specific biomarkers and give recommendations for future biomarker studies.",

Only papers in English concerning human subjects were included and only studies dealing with a comparison between a PD group of at least 10 patients and a control group were considered. For proteomic studies, differently expressed proteins had to be validated in individual samples. Only studies using lumbar CSF were used, excluding studies on ventricular or post-mortem CSF, because of the different protein composition of ventricular CSF compared to lumbar CSF (Reiber, 1994) and degradation of proteins due to post-mortem delay, respectively. In total, 141 papers fulfilled the criteria. Proteins included in these studies were classified according to their expected function or their relationship to PD pathogenesis. Several proteins had multiple alleged roles and could be assigned to multiple groups. Therefore, we simplified the classification by assigning proteins to the group of their expected main contribution or relationship to PD pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Already in the eighties and nineties of the 20th century, mitochondrial dysfunction was implicated in PD pathogenesis through a reduction of mitochondrial complex I activity in the substantia nigra of PD patients compared to controls (Schapira et al., 1989). The realisation that a metabolite of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), which exhibits its effect by interference in the mitochondrial electron transport chain by inhibiting mitochondrial complex I (Tipton and Singer, 1993), could cause parkinsonism and the development of an MPTP animal model for PD further stressed the role of mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial complex I was also shown to be inhibited by the pesticide rotenone. Chronic exposure to this pesticide can result in symptoms that resemble Parkinson's disease (Betarbet et al., 2000). Furthermore, altered levels of the mitochondria-related proteins prohibitin, ATP synthase and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) were demonstrated in the substantia nigra and frontal cortex tissue of PD patients compared to controls (Ferrer et al., 2007). Moreover, the protein products of many genes associated with monogenetic forms of parkinsonism, including \u03b1-synuclein, Parkin, DJ-1, PINK1, LRRK2 and HTRA2, have been implicated in mitochondrial dysfunction and/or oxidative stress (Lin and Beal, 2006). Loss of mitochondrial function is likely to play a major role in apoptosis-mediated cell death via release of pro-apoptotic proteins like cytochrome C, second messenger of mitochondrial activator of caspases (SMAC) and HTRA2 (Lin and Beal, 2006), and reduced ATP formation by oxidative phosphorylation. Moreover, dysfunction of mitochondria leads to an increase in oxygen free radicals and, consequently, increased oxidative stress (Schapira, 2008). Indeed, in the substantia nigra of PD patients increased amounts of oxidatively modified proteins have been observed, such as oxidatively modified UCH-L1 (Choi et al., 2004) and nitrated \u03b1-synuclein (Giasson et al., 2000). In addition to increased levels of oxidatively modified proteins, alterations in antioxidant protective systems, most notably reduced levels of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) have been identified in the substantia nigra of PD patients compared to controls (Sian et al., 1994).",

Mutations in the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system, a system that labels proteins with ubiquitin and guides them to the proteasome for degradation, can also result in parkinsonism (Schapira, 2008). The ubiquitin dependent proteolytic pathway is affected in patients with a mutation in the ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 (UCH-L1) gene, a mutation reported in two German siblings (Leroy et al., 1998), and in patients with Parkin mutations that accounts for almost 50% of familial young-onset PD (Lucking et al., 2000).",

            "text": "The production of misfolded, mutant, denatured or otherwise damaged proteins and their impaired degradation results in the accumulation and aggregation of proteins and the formation of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. A highly prevalent protein in Lewy type pathology is \u03b1-synuclein, a protein that is normally present in the presynaptic terminals of most neurons. Point mutations, duplications and triplications of the \u03b1-synuclein gene are associated with hereditary forms of PD (Polymeropoulos et al., 1997, Kruger et al., 1998, Zarranz et al., 2004, Chartier-Harlin et al., 2004, Singleton et al., 2003). \u03b1-Synuclein is present in its monomeric form, although trimers may also be present in physiological conditions (Leng et al., 2001). In PD and other synucleinopathies, monomeric \u03b1-synuclein aggregates into insoluble fibrils. Intermediate stages in the formation of these aggregates are soluble oligomers and the subsequently formed \u03b1-synuclein protofibrils (El-Agnaf et al., 2003). These intermediates are considered to be the toxic forms of \u03b1-synuclein (El-Agnaf et al., 2003, Schapira, 2006, Kazantsev and Kolchinsky, 2008). Several factors facilitate fibril formation and subsequent aggregation, for example point mutations in the \u03b1-synuclein gene, phosphorylation of \u03b1-synuclein at Ser129, a decrease in pH, an increase in temperature or the presence of metal ions and other small charged molecules (reviewed in Uversky (2007)). In addition, the aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein can be induced by the protein tissue transglutaminase. Tissue transglutaminase may contribute to the formation of Lewy bodies by crosslinking \u03b1-synuclein proteins (Junn et al., 2003). A recent proteomic analysis revealed that in addition to \u03b1-synuclein, many other proteins are present in Lewy bodies, including several kinases, ligases and proteins involved in protein folding, membrane trafficking and oxidative stress (Xia et al., 2008).",

It is hypothesized that the inflammatory changes contribute to the cascade of events leading to neurodegeneration and hence disease progression (Hirsch and Hunot, 2009). However, inflammation may also be a response to the neurodegenerative process. Supportive of a contributory role of inflammation in PD pathogenesis is the relationship between polymorphisms in neuro-inflammation associated genes, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1-beta and interleukin-6, and the risk of PD (Hirsch and Hunot, 2009) as well as the protective effect of non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Chen et al., 2003). However, neuro-inflammatory processes are not specific for PD, but are also observed in other neurodegenerative disorders associated with parkinsonism, such as PSP and MSA (McGeer & McGeer, 2004, Sakurai et al., 2002).",

Furthermore, the concentration of anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2 (Yuan and Yankner, 2000) was compensatorily increased in nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in PD patients compared to controls (Mogi et al., 1996a). Also soluble Fas, an apoptosis-signaling receptor molecule, and Annexin V, which plays a role in apoptotic cell death and necrosis, were increased in the substantia nigra in PD suggesting a role for apoptosis in PD pathogenesis (Mogi et al., 1996b, Werner et al., 2008). The fact that mutations in the apoptosis related HTRA2 gene were demonstrated in PD patients (Strauss et al., 2005) further strengthens the likelihood of involvement of apoptosis in the pathogenesis of PD.

Waragai et al. reported increased levels of DJ-1 in PD patients compared to non-PD controls, especially in the early stages of PD (Waragai et al., 2006). A more recent study however reported decreased DJ-1 levels in CSF of PD patients compared to Alzheimer's disease patients and controls. The discrepancy between the results of the two studies was ascribed to either cross-reactive molecules detected by the ELISA technique, limitations of the ELISA kit itself, or the degree of blood contamination (Hong et al., 2010). Changes in the levels of oxidative stress related proteins have also been demonstrated in the CSF of PD patients. For example the concentration of nitrated manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), an assumed marker for peroxynitrite-mediated oxidative stress was increased in a group of 10 PD patients compared to controls (Aoyama et al., 2000).",

The ferroxidase enzyme in ceruloplasmin converts Fe2+ into Fe3+ that is transported by transferrin. Together they limit the Fe2+-catalyzed generation of toxic hydroxyl radicals (Loeffler et al., 1994). CSF transferrin levels in PD patients did not differ from the CSF levels in controls (Loeffler et al., 1994, van Kamp et al., 1995), but ferroxidase activity and CSF ceruloplasmin levels were reduced in PD (Boll et al., 1999, Boll et al., 2008) (ceruloplasmin: sensitivity of 0.556 at 95% specificity of ROC curve; area under ROC curve 0.809 (Abdi et al., 2006)).",

This oligomeric form of \u03b1-synuclein was increased in CSF of patients with Lewy body disease (PD and DLB combined) compared to non-Lewy body disease subjects (controls and tauopathies) (Maetzler et al., 2009c). However, these results have not been included in our Table 1\n, because levels of oligomeric \u03b1-synuclein of the PD patients were not reported separately by Maetzler et al. Total \u03b1-synuclein in CSF was either decreased (Tokuda et al., 2006, Mollenhauer et al., 2008, Hong et al., 2010) or unchanged (Borghi et al., 2000, Ohrfelt et al., 2009) in PD patients compared to controls. The largest study on CSF levels of \u03b1-synuclein was recently published by Hong et al. who observed reduced levels of \u03b1-synuclein in 117 PD patients compared to both 50 Alzheimer's disease patients and 132 controls after controlling for blood contamination (Hong et al., 2010). No association between \u03b1-synuclein levels and disease severity was found in this study, in contrast to the results of a previous study that showed an inverse correlation between \u03b1-synuclein and disease severity (Tokuda et al., 2006).",

Osteopontin levels, one of several other proteins expressed in Lewy bodies, were also increased in CSF of PD patients compared to controls (Maetzler et al., 2007). This protein may be involved in many pathogenetic mechanisms including oxidative stress, mitochondrial impairment, apoptosis and cytokine regulation. Other proteins that have been detected in Lewy bodies are neurofilaments (Hill et al., 1991) that are part of the cytoskeleton. Levels of both neurofilament heavy chain and light isoforms were similar in the CSF of PD patients compared to controls (Abdo et al., 2007, Brettschneider et al., 2006, Holmberg et al., 1998). However, neurofilament levels were increased in CSF of PSP and MSA patients compared to PD patients, an observation that has been interpreted to reflect the progressive nature of the disease process in these diseases (Abdo et al., 2007, Brettschneider et al., 2006, Holmberg et al., 1998).",

These decreased levels of components of the complement system could indicate an overactivation of the complement system and subsequent depletion. Furthermore, the growth factors brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), growth associated protein (GAP-43), insulin-like growth factor-1 and striatal derived neurotrophic factor were reported to be differently expressed, although results are conflicting for BDNF (Carvey et al., 1991, Sjogren et al., 2000, Zhang et al., 2008, Salehi and Mashayekhi, 2009, Mashayekhi et al., 2010). CSF studies also linked PD to the generation of auto-antibodies and increased viral antibody levels (Fazzini et al., 1992, Gao et al., 1994, Marttila et al., 1982), although intrathecal antibody production could not be demonstrated (Marttila et al., 1982).",

The three CSF markers most studied in AD, namely tau, phosphorylated tau and beta amyloid-42, have repeatedly been studied in PD. In PD, beta amyloid-42 was incidentally found to be decreased (Bibl et al., 2007, Compta et al., 2009, Parnetti et al., 2008, Sjogren et al., 2002) but in general appeared unchanged compared to controls (Holmberg et al., 2003, Lins et al., 2004, Mollenhauer et al., 2006, Sjogren et al., 2000, Verbeek et al., 2004, Zhang et al., 2008, Kanemaru et al., 2000). Differences in CSF tau or phosphorylated tau levels between PD and controls have only been demonstrated twice (Abdo et al., 2007, Compta et al., 2009). Most other AD associated proteins were unchanged in PD (Abdi et al., 2006, de la Monte et al., 1992, Jansen et al., 1998, Kahle et al., 2000, Monte et al., 1997, Yamada et al., 1993, Lidstrom et al., 2001), except for apoE and apoAII protein (Zhang et al., 2008, Guo et al., 2009), which were different compared to controls. Recently, Compta et al. reported that dissimilar levels of tau, phosphorylated tau and beta amyloid-42 could only be demonstrated in a subgroup of PD patients, namely patients that were diagnosed with Parkinson's disease related dementia (PDD) (Compta et al., 2009). An explanation for these findings might be that underlying AD-pathology in PDD is responsible for the different levels of AD associated proteins.",

            "text": "CSF neuropeptides have been studied extensively in the eighties and nineties of the last century. Neuropeptides are short polymers of amino acids secreted by neurons for interneuronal communication purposes. They may modulate receptor sensitivity and interact with other neurotransmitters (Strittmatter et al., 1996). Several neuropeptides are decreased in CSF of PD patients compared to controls, including Met-Enkephalin (Fischer, 1974, Yaksh et al., 1990), cholecystokinin-8 (Lotstra et al., 1985) and arginine vasopressin (Olsson et al., 1987, Sundquist et al., 1983). A potential explanation for this decrease is cell death of specific neurons or suppression of their secretory activity (Strittmatter et al., 1996). Cell death may on the other hand result in increased levels of neuropeptides through the release of peptides from damaged brain tissue (Espino et al., 1995). Raised CSF peptide levels have been demonstrated for diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) (Ferrero et al., 1988a, Ferrero et al., 1988b) and des-ala-somatostatin (Strittmatter et al., 1996). Several neuropeptides have been reported only once and the results of some neuropeptide studies led to conflicting data (Dupont et al., 1982, Espino et al., 1995, Jolkkonen et al., 1986, Strittmatter et al., 1996, Strittmatter and Cramer, 1992, Unger et al., 1988).",

We state that the most sensitive and specific biomarkers for PD are within this group of pathogenesis related proteins. Table 3\nlists the proteins that fulfil these criteria and provides the direction of change of protein levels in CSF and affected brain tissue. The list includes the oxidative stress related proteins ceruloplasmin, DJ-1 and oxidatively modified SOD1, the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase and proteins related to protein aggregation and Lewy body formation: \u03b1-synuclein, tissue transglutaminase and osteopontin. Furthermore, a number of proteins involved in inflammation and glial activation are candidate PD biomarkers: interleukin-1-beta, interleukin-6, BDNF, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and beta-2-microglobulin. While the direction of change for several studied proteins is the same in CSF and brain tissue, changes in opposite directions have been observed for a number of proteins, including ceruloplasmin, DJ-1 and osteopontin. This may be the result of active transport (i.e. secretion or extraction) between tissue and CSF. Conflicting results among studied CSF proteins might result from differences in the applied assays and/or the significant effect of blood contamination that was reported for CSF levels of both DJ-1 and \u03b1-synuclein (Hong et al., 2010). The list is still limited and will undoubtedly grow in the near future by the application of proteomics and the subsequent validation of identified proteins. Furthermore, additional proteins might result from the identification of new pathogenetic processes involved in PD. It is important to stress that the candidacy of a couple of the selected potential biomarkers is based on single findings. There is a strong need for validation of the potential CSF biomarkers in preferentially pathologically confirmed cohorts and, to account for inter-laboratory variability, in multiple centers.",

Several of the proteins listed in Table 3 have been studied in other neurodegenerative disorders. Although the majority of these proteins have not been studied in the atypical parkinsonian syndromes PSP and MSA, it is clear that several of these proteins are not specific for PD. The lack of specificity applies to proteins associated with different pathogenetic processes, varying from increased oxidative stress to inflammation. For example, CSF levels of glucocerebrosidase activity, decreased in PD, were also decreased in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) patients (Parnetti et al., 2009). CSF levels of DJ-1 have not yet been evaluated in other neurodegenerative diseases. In multiple sclerosis patients, however, DJ-1 CSF levels were significantly higher in comparison to controls (Hirotani et al., 2008). Inflammatory proteins seem to be the least specific pathogenetic group. Inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1-beta levels were increased in CSF of patients with small infarcts (Sun et al., 2009) and AD (Blum-Degen et al., 1995), whereas TIMP-1 was increased in CSF of patients diagnosed with PSP, AD, Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lorenzl et al., 2003). In addition, IL-6, BDNF and TNF-\u03b1 were increased in CSF of AD patients (Blum-Degen et al., 1995, Tarkowski et al., 1999, Zhang et al., 2008), like in PD patients.",

Much like PD, both MSA and PSP are neuropathologically characterized by the presence of protein aggregates. In MSA, the aggregates are principally composed of \u03b1-synuclein and are located in oligodendroglial cells (Wakabayashi et al., 1998). In PSP, hyperphosphorylated tau accumulates in neurons (Hauw et al., 1994). Proteins involved in apoptosis and antioxidant proteins such as bcl-2 and DJ-1 can also be detected post-mortem in aggregates in MSA (reviewed in Wenning et al. (2008)). In PSP, as in PD, kinases, mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic inflammation may play an important role in pathogenesis (Ludolph et al., 2009).",

However, sensitive, specific and thoroughly validated diagnostic CSF markers for PD have not yet been identified. Proteins that are related to the pathogenesis and in addition are differently expressed in PD patients compared to controls in affected brain tissue and CSF, such as the antioxidant DJ-1, \u03b1-synuclein or the \u03b1-synuclein crosslinking protein tissue transglutaminase, may be potential candidate biomarkers. However, the specificity of these candidate biomarkers may be low, due to heterogeneity in disease pathology and pathological overlap with other neurodegenerative disorders. Specificity and sensitivity may be increased by selecting a set of CSF biomarkers and combine them with non-biochemical markers, for example brain imaging or olfactory testing. Unbiased discovery using mass spectrometry based CSF proteomics that includes both PD patients and several other diagnostic groups might yield additional PD-specific biomarkers. Such proteomics findings need to be translated into the development of more convenient multiparameter tests for large-scale analysis and broad application among laboratories. Another important element that is still lacking is the reproduction of findings and large-scale validation of candidate biomarkers, preferentially in neuropathologically confirmed PD patients and in more accessible body fluids such as blood and urine, fluids in which brain tissue proteins may be present in low concentrations. Validation in patient groups of different disease stages as well as longitudinal studies may reveal markers that reflect or predict disease progression.
