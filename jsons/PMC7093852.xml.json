At evaluation, he was afebrile with an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air, and a chest X-ray showed a left-sided opacity (Figure 1\nA). The patient was diagnosed as acute bronchitis, prescribed 20 mg prednisolone daily for 5 days and paracetamol, and discharged. He returned to the emergency department on April 6, 2014, with persistent cough and shortness of breath; a chest X-ray showed a left-sided opacity and air bronchograms, and the patient was diagnosed with pneumonia, given a prescription for levofloxacin, and discharged (Figure 1B). He returned to the emergency department the same day, with worsening shortness of breath and was admitted. He had a temperature of 38.7\u00b0C, pulse of 113 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 123/73, an oxygen saturation of 93% on room air, and left basal crackles and rales. An arterial blood gas on room air showed pH of 7.49, partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 27.6 mm Hg, partial pressure of oxygen of 52.4 mm Hg, and bicarbonate of 20.7 mEq/L, consistent with respiratory alkalosis. Laboratory evaluation showed a normal white blood cell count with lymphopenia (0.5 K/\u03bcL) and creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL (Supplemental Table S1). Blood, sputum, and urine cultures were obtained, and a nasopharyngeal swab specimen was sent for MERS-CoV testing. On April 7, day 1 of admission, oseltamivir, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin were started empirically. The day after admission he was transferred to the intensive care unit for tachypnea and respiratory distress and was intubated for mechanical ventilation; a portable chest X-ray showed multiple patchy airspace opacities (Figure 1C). The patient became hypotensive, requiring inotropic support, and developed acute kidney injury and renal failure, requiring dialysis. On April 8, RT-PCR assay of the nasopharyngeal swab specimen collected on April 7 was reported to be positive for MERS-CoV for UpE and ORF1a gene targets.16 Bacterial cultures of blood, sputum, and urine specimens obtained at admission after antibiotic administration were negative. On April 9, he was given 100 mg hydrocortisone intravenously every 8 hours and started on nitric oxide at 16 ppm. The patient's condition continued to deteriorate, and he died April 10.",

Dispersed foci of necrotic debris were seen both subpleurally and within alveoli. No viral inclusions were seen, and moderate anthracosis was present. All four antibodies (1510/1513, 1511, 1512, and 1514) highlighted multiple foci of MERS-CoV antigens, predominantly localized within the cytoplasm of pneumocytes and syncytial cells (Figure 2, D\u2013F). Sections of trachea and bronchi showed mild-to-moderate lymphocytic mucosal and submucosal inflammation with a few neutrophils and plasma cells (Figure 2G). Occasional clusters of noninvasive and extracellular candida yeast and hyphae were seen in septa, alveolar spaces, and overlying respiratory epithelium, suggesting postmortem overgrowth. Bronchial submucosal glands were focally necrotic (Figure 2H). Immunostaining for MERS-CoV antigens was identified in both unremarkable and necrotic bronchial submucosal glands (Figure 2I).",

Double staining with cytokeratin confirmed the presence of viral antigens within pneumocytes and epithelial syncytial cells, whereas double staining with CD68 showed two distinct populations with no colocalization of MERS-CoV and macrophages (Figure 3\n, A and B). Surfactant double staining revealed type 2 pneumocytes and syncytial cells with intracytoplasmic viral antigens (Figure 3C). DPP4 antigens were detected in pneumocytes, syncytial cells, mononuclear leukocytes, and vascular endothelium, although colocalization of MERS-CoV and DPP4 was observed in scattered pneumocytes and syncytial cells (Figure 3D). Electron microscopy showed infected and degenerated pneumocytes encased between hyaline membranes, composed of fibrin and basement membranes (Figure 3E). Clusters or individualized, predominately spherical, 50 to 150 nm in diameter, viral particles were observed in membrane-bound vesicles (Figure 3F).",

The histopathologic pattern observed in the lungs was diffuse alveolar damage. MERS-CoV IHC and double staining techniques showed viral antigens were predominantly localized to type 2 pneumocytes and epithelial syncytial cells. Although the pathogenesis of severe and fatal MERS-CoV infection is unknown, these postmortem findings provide critical insights, including evidence that pneumocytes are important targets, suggesting that direct cytopathic effects contribute to MERS-CoV respiratory symptoms. An ex vivo study that examined MERS-CoV\u2013infected human lung tissue found evidence of pneumocyte damage by electron microscopy, including detachment of type 2 pneumocytes, and membrane blebbing, suggestive of apoptosis.17 However, IHC staining for MERS-CoV was patchy, implying that other causes such as immune dysfunction may be relevant. Acute renal failure is commonly observed in critically ill MERS-CoV patients7, 8, 9, 18 and MERS-CoV RNA was detected in urine18, 19; however, no evidence of extrapulmonary MERS-CoV dissemination was observed, suggesting that acute renal failure in this patient was not caused by direct renal infection but likely by other factors, such as hypoperfusion or cytokine dysregulation. The presence of MERS-CoV antigens in submucosal glands provides a mechanism by which the virus enters respiratory secretions and becomes transmissible.",

In addition, ex vivo models have detected MERS-CoV antigen in bronchial epithelial cells, pneumocytes, and endothelium and DPP4 in bronchiolar epithelium, endothelium, pneumocytes, and alveolar macrophages,17, 21 correlating with our findings. In contrast, the functional receptor for SARS-CoV is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.22 Similar to DDP4, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 has a broad distribution, with heavy expression in alveolar epithelial cells, enterocytes, and endothelial cells.23 Although evidence shows that SARS-CoV also infects type 2 pneumocytes,24, 25 SARS-CoV was detected in several extrapulmonary sites by in situ hybridization and electron microscopy, including circulating lymphocytes, lymphoid tissues, renal distal tubules, and small intestinal mucosa.26 Because MERS-CoV RNA was detected in blood,19 and DPP4 is widely distributed in different tissues,10 extrapulmonary dissemination could be possible, but we did not detect any evidence of MERS-CoV spread outside the respiratory tract.",

Follicular depletion in lymph nodes, consistent with corticosteroid use, was noted, and no bacterial coinfections were identified. The hydrocortisone dosing of 100 mg every 8 hours in the intensive care unit before death was higher than recommended for refractory septic shock by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidance,27 but the patient only received a few doses. A systematic review of high-dose corticosteroids for treatment of SARS-CoV reported evidence of harm without survival benefit.28 In patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection, corticosteroid treatment was associated with increased mortality,29 although further studies are needed. Therefore, until further evidence is available, high-dose corticosteroid treatment for MERS-CoV pulmonary disease should be avoided.30 Current clinical management of MERS-CoV patients is based on supportive care of complications and adherence to recommended infection prevention and control measures (CDC, http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/infection-prevention-control.html, last accessed October 9, 2015).",
