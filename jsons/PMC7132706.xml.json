            "text": "Bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) was first described in 1946 in New York dairy cattle where it was manifested as a gastroenteritis with severe diarrhea, ulcerations of the muzzle, nostrils, and oral cavity, fever, leukopenia, reduction in milk secretion, cessation of rumination, and abortions. Mortality ranged from 4 to 8 per cent. In 1953 a similar but more severe condition was described in Iowa in which morbidity was 5 to 20 per cent and the fatality rate was high. This condition was called mucosal disease and was characterized by fever, watery and sometimes bloody diarrhea, profuse salivation, emaciation, dehydration, depression, a mucopurulent nasal exudate, and erosions and ulcerations of the nostrils, muzzle, lips, gums, tongue, and oral cavity. Both diseases have since been shown to be due to the same virus, referred to as the bovine diarrhea\u2014mucosal disease virus or, more commonly, the bovine virus diarrhea virus (BVDV).",

The latter two viruses are antigenically closely related to BVDV, based on studies by cross-neutralization, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence. There is strong evidence that Border disease virus (BDV) of sheep is, in fact, BVDV, based on cross-infectivity and clinical responses of cattle to BDV and sheep to BVDV.",

Serologic surveys of unvaccinated cattle in the United States have indicated that 60 to 80 per cent have antibodies to BVD. A majority of BVD infections in cattle are subclinical but may persist and exacerbate as overt clinical disease in association with stress and concurrent acute infections with other agents. Grunder et al. have listed six clinical categories of BVDV infection in cattle that reflect their experiences in Germany with 117 cases over eight years.8 These categories reasonably reflect the forms of BVD manifested in North America as well: (1) peracute fibrinohemorrhagic enteritis (in calves three to four months old), (2) acute respiratory or pneumoenteritis syndrome (in calves over three months old; in the United States, often one to three weeks old), (3) subclinical form (all age groups), (4) acute, subacute and chronic mucosal disease (in calves from six months to two years of age), (5) abortion, premature birth, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, and weak neonatal calves (in pregnant cows), and (6) acute catarrhal enteritis (mostly in cattle under two years of age). These categories would be representative of the forms of BVD we have encountered, but with less confinement to specific age categories for some. For example, peracute hemorrhagic enteritis, which they indicate as most common in calves three to four months of age, has been seen fairly frequently by us in adult heifers and cows just after parturition.",

A large percentage of commercial lots of fetal bovine serum, which is used as part of the fluid medium for bovine embryos, contains BVDV, usually noncytopathic strains. Bovine virus diarrhea virus has been demonstrated to be lethal for bovine embryos and hence may be responsible for a significant reduction in successful embryo transplants. Obviously, procedures that will inactivate BVDV in fetal bovine serum, such as gamma irradiation (cobalt or other source), should therefore be used before any lots of fetal bovine serum are used in embryo transplantation media.",

Bovine viral diarrhea must be differentiated from rinderpest, malignant catarrhal fever, blue tongue, vesicular diseases, salmonellosis, coccidiosis, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, and papular and ulcerative stomatitis. The severe mucosal disease form of BVD with alimentary tract erosions, bloody diarrhea, dehydration, and peracute to acute death occurs relatively infrequently in an outbreak. Differentiation from other diseases can to some extent therefore be based on the clinical history, morbidity, and mortality in a herd, and pathologic lesions. Definitive diagnosis, however, requires laboratory procedures such as virus isolation, demonstration of viral antigens in tissue sections by immunofluorescence, and demonstration of rising antibody titers between acute and convalescent serum samples. Serologic methods for assaying serum antibodies include virus neutralization, complement fixation, enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA), immunodiffusion precipitation, and fluorescence inhibition.",

Impaired function of phagocytic cells (both macrophages and neutrophils) and of B-lymphocytes and T-lymphocytes has been well documented.

These highly stressed animals are hardly ideal candidates for modified live virus vaccine or for any vaccine.

One must be particularly concerned that any vaccines used in pregnant cows, or in other animals in contact with pregnant cows, are safe for and will not cause adverse effects upon the fetus (death, anomalies, abortion, stillbirth). Current modified live virus BVD vaccines are not approved for use in pregnant cows because of these risks. There are stituations, however, where the author and others have found a porcine cell line origin, modified live virus, NADL strain, BVD vaccine to be safe when used in pregnant dairy cows during the last trimester of gestation, that is, during the dry period. The indication for such use of this vaccine has been a persisting herd problem of weakness and pneumoenteritis with high mortality of neonatal calves involving BVDV and other complicating agents. A licensed vaccine containing the Singer strain of BVDV has been used in a similar way by many veterinarians. Results of such use, i.e., vaccinating pregnant cows and heifers with these BVD vaccines at seven to eight months\u2019 gestation, have been very gratifying. In most instances, there has followed a dramatic reduction in neonatal calf morbidity and mortality.",

In cross-protection studies in calves, all strains appeared to cross-protect against challenge of immunity done 30 to 50 days after immunization. Longer term cross-protective immunity studies have not, however, been done. It is our belief, based on field experience, that homologous strain BVDV immunity is probably of relatively long duration but that heterologous strain immunity wanes by six months to one year. We therefore advocate annual vaccination of dairy cattle, during the open period, about two to three weeks after parturition.

In herds with proven BVD in young calves and postparturient cows and heifers, vaccination of pregnant cows and heifers during the last trimester of pregnancy has been found to be safe and efficacious in reducing BVDV-related morbidity.

Many believe they are important components of the bovine respiratory disease complex, especially when associated with various stress factors and combined with other infectious agents, such as other viruses, mycoplasmas, chlamydiae, and other bacteria.

As with bovine respiratory diseases, it is likely that single agent infections are the exception rather than the rule. Particularly in situations of poor management, housing, and nutrition of baby calves, the situation is optimal for E. coli, rotaviruses, and coronaviruses to inflict their severest effect. Well-ventilated, dry, uncrowded housing, good sanitation, and adequate nutrition are important ingredients of good management to prevent both respiratory and enteric diseases. It is my opinion that late-term vaccination of pregnant cows with recently available E. coli, K-99 bacterins, and rotavirus/coronavirus combination vaccines, combined with a program assuring early and continuous feeding of colostrum from vaccinated cows to neonatal calves through one month of age, provides the best approach to prevention of calf enteritis. This, of course, assumes that the above other management factors are optimized. The more or less continuous presence of passive antibodies in the gut of young calves, provided by the feeding of colostrum, appears to be the most rational approach for this problem.",
