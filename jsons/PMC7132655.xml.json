First, members of the APIC PPC conducted a literature review to identify relevant guidelines and policy documents that address the issue of safely reusing respiratory protection. Identified sources consisted of existing federal, public policy, and international agencies\u2019 guidelines including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Division of TB Elimination; Division Healthcare Quality Promotion; National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health; Food and Drug Administration; Health and Human Services; Institute of Medicine; Occupational Safety and Health Administration; and the World Health Organization. Once the recommendations were drafted, the APIC PPC submitted the document to the APIC EPC for review and editing. The APIC EPC reviewed the document for accuracy and feasibility. Discrepancies were discussed between both committees until consensus was reached. This process resulted in an evidence-based document that addresses the realities of disaster response when resources of respiratory protection are almost certain to be limited or nonexistent.",

First, members of the APIC EPC outlined the necessary components of the document using a literature review and their expertise in the field of disaster planning. Next, each APIC EPC member volunteered to develop a section of the document. APIC EPC members were instructed to do a thorough literature review for their section and record the source for each statement or recommendation made in the document. A working group of APIC EPC members gathered at a face-to-face meeting to review and collate the materials into a cohesive document. Gaps in the document were identified, and final revisions were made. Once the document was drafted, it was sent to a group of internal (APIC members with expertise in disaster planning) and external reviewers from a variety of disaster planning agencies, including the Red Cross, local and state public health departments, first responders, and others. This rigorous process resulted in an evidence-based document that addresses the multitude of infection prevention issues surrounding sheltering large numbers of displaced individuals.",

The document is provided in short sections that are arranged by topic so that disaster responders and shelter workers can quickly find an answer to a specific question, such as how to set up a surveillance system within the shelter. A table of contents is provided to allow users to quickly identify the topics. Topics outlined in the Infection Prevention in Shelters document are listed in Table 2\n. A few of the most important topics covered in the Infection Prevention in Shelters document include when and how to perform hand hygiene; how to put on, use, and remove PPE; how to set up a surveillance system for a shelter; and how to manage pets. Some of these issues, such as hand hygiene and PPE, have long been identified as being critical during disasters. Other topics, such as pet management, have only recently been identified as potential issues in community shelters. The Infection Prevention in Shelters document aimed to address all issues that might contribute to infection transmission in community shelters during a disaster.",

Updating and implementing the key elements of infection prevention and control activities in shelters should continue to be part of the community's preparedness planning efforts. It is important to continue to communicate and update all partners involved in sheltering any time that plans are revised.

This article outlines 2 new products that provide guidance and recommendations for preventing infection transmission during disasters for both health care and community settings. The new APIC products address some of the most critical issues facing disaster planners today: how to allocate limited resources during disasters in a manner that provides as much protection to health care staff as possible and how to implement an infection prevention program in non-health care settings such as community shelters during a disaster. These products address issues that have long been a problem during disaster response, such as food and water safety, and newly identified topics that may affect infection transmission in shelters, such as pet management.",

Previous APIC products have been developed by a single committee or an individual/group assigned by a member of APIC Headquarters. As more is learned about the potential infectious disease implications of disasters, it is becoming evident that a multidisciplinary approach is needed when developing reference and educational materials related to this topic. Many emergency management issues have potential policy implications, such as the reuse of respiratory protection, yet also require expertise in disaster planning. Without a multidisciplinary approach, reference and educational materials may not meet APIC members\u2019 needs nor be as accurate and effective as possible. The APIC emergency preparedness and public policy committees will continue to work together to develop new educational and reference materials for APIC members and the general public related to infection prevention during disasters.",
