International student mobility, in its multiplicity of forms, continues to be a high priority of internationalization, which refers to students moving from a country of origin to a country of education for study in a limited time (Knight 2012). More specific, inward student mobility is viewed from the perspective of the chosen country of study (that is, the favorite destinations), which brings a potential \u201cbrain-gain\u201d (Murphy-Lejeune 2008).",

            "text": "There were about 5.3 million international students pursuing higher education overseas in 2017, comparing with 3.3 million in 2008 (OECD 2019). They have the potential to bring significant academic and economic implications, and their numbers are expected to grow continuously (Knight 2012). However, perhaps as important as the rising numbers of international students is the fact that the traditionally dominant destination countries for international students (e.g., the USA, the UK, Australia, etc.) face growing competition from newly industrialized countries like China, Russia, Singapore, and Malaysia. These countries, which once sent large numbers of students abroad, are gradually becoming recipients of international students, as a result of their efforts in promoting inward student mobility (de Wit et al. 2013; Abdullah et al. 2017). For instance, in 2017, China sent 608,400 students to study abroad while at the same time hosted 489,200 international students (Ministry of Education of China, 2018). In the same year, according to OECD (2019), Russia took the fourth largest market share of international education globally, with a percentage of 5%, following the US (18%), UK (8%), and Australia (7%). The primary motives for these countries\u2019 push on inward student mobility can be summarized as: enhancing international influence, promoting international exchanges, accelerating the process of building leading universities, and potentially generating economic gains (Cao et al. 2016; Abdullah et al. 2017; Choudaha 2017).",

Therefore, when imaging inward international students, the notions of \u201cglobal education market\u201d and \u201cglobal student market\u201d are often used, which underpin the commercial value of inward student mobility and ignore its function as cooperation and a \u201cwin-win\u201d (Marginson 2016a). In fact, inward student mobility is not solely market-driven. It brings various academic and social benefits not only to the host country but to other countries, including the countries of student origin. In light of this, (global) common goods can be a more inclusive lens to understand inward student mobility, since this concept highlights collective endeavor, shared participation/engagement, diversity, inclusion, and responsibility (UNESCO 2015).",

Although closely related to the idea of public goods, the concept of common goods has its own specific meaning and implications1 (see Table 1). Common goods can be defined as goods that are characterized by a binding destination and necessary for the realization of the fundamental rights of all people, irrespective of any public or private origin (UNESCO 2015, p.77). \u201cThe good realized in the mutual relationships in and through which human beings achieve their well-being\u201d (Hollenbach 2002, p.81), which is inherent to the relationships that exist among the members of a society tied together in a collective endeavor (UNESCO 2015, p.78).

They then take the orchestra as an example to illustrate how a common good is produced and how its benefits can be enjoyed. The good itself, an orchestra, cannot exist without each musician playing their respective parts and performing collectively for the whole audience. In other words, the good exists in the shared action which generates it. Also, benefiting from such good is by participating in it, whether in the orchestra or audience. Hence, the shared action is both intrinsic (without the various musicians\u2019 participation and performance, the orchestra cannot exist at all) and instrumental (it is necessary, efficient, and convenient to perform as an orchestra) to the good itself, and its benefits (an orchestra; beautiful music; excellent performance) are generated from the course of that shared action. Such kinds of goods are intrinsically common in their production and their benefits, reflecting the distinct characteristics of intrinsic value and shared participation (Deneulin and Townsend 2007; UNESCO 2015). In other words, the benefits and burdens for the realization of common goods are intrinsically shared among all participants, thus the common quality of these goods is not preexisting but is dynamic and contingent, emphasizing a process of participatory democracy (Locatelli 2018a).",

Apart from this, higher education as a common good is closely related to such concepts as equity, justice, solidarity, and inclusion (Walker and McLean 2013, Marginson 2016b). Also, the idea of common goods in higher education is especially important in the process of globalization and internationalization, because it refuses to be closed and conservative, encouraging global universities and educators to collaborate jointly and participate actively (Tian 2019).",

After the reform and opening-up, policies for international students studying in China gradually moved from closed to open, and the decision to accept and educate international students in China shifted from government to HEIs. Meanwhile, more than a few HEIs began to recruit self-funded international students, and the number of these students rose rapidly (Jin 2012). Later in the 1990s, several improvements were made in the international education system. For instance, in 1992, the HSK (Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi, which is a standard Chinese language proficiency test) was used as a standard test for evaluating the language ability of international students. In 1996, the Ministry of Education established the China Scholarship Council, which specialized in organizing, funding, and managing Chinese students studying abroad and international students studying in China.",

In 2018, the number of international students studying in China was 492,185, about 11 times when compared with 44,711 in 1999 (see Fig. 1). China has entered the 10 highest-ranked destination countries in the world of international education, with the majority of international students coming from South Korea, Thailand, and Pakistan in 2018 (see Table 3). In terms of policies, the Administrative Measures for the Enrolment and Cultivation of International Students by Schools issued in 2017 clarified various aspects of inward student mobility, concerning degree certificates, training methods, curriculums, and so on, further improving the management system for international students studying in China.

(2018) consider that international student mobility has brought diverse and plentiful benefits to students, home and host institutions, communities, and countries, for instance, international students can be portrayed as precious human capital to boost the host country\u2019s economy and also as sources of income for the higher education sector. Specifically, in the Chinese context, Fang and Wu (2016) consider that international students improve the level of internationalization of Chinese higher education. Also, they assume that international students not only increase the direct economic benefits but also stimulate the growth of related service industries such as catering, transportation, and tourism. Similarly, Jiang (2010a) notes that international students studying in China have the potential to create economic benefits, though this has not received sufficient attention in China and it lacks reliable official statistics. Han (2014), Ma and Zhou (2018) agree that international education in China has cultivated a large number of professional talents and develop cooperative relations with other countries. Moreover, in recent years, under the background of Belt and Road Initiative, Chen and Wen (2018) suggest that international students play a central role in improving diplomatic relations and these students are human resources for Chinese enterprises overseas. However, research touches little on the common good(s) of inward student mobility in China, though some Chinese scholars have put forward that higher education contributes to (global) common goods in four respects: research outputs; public services; cultural inheritance and innovation; and talents (with global perspectives) (Tian and Liu 2019). The mobility of these global talents and cultural exchanges are conducive to building a community of shared future for humanity (ren lei ming yun gong tong ti) (Yang 2018).",

Through international education, international students will become global citizens who care for the whole world and make contributions to form a more inclusive, tolerable, and equal world.The wider sharing of educational resources. Inward student mobility intensifies educational cooperation between different countries and accelerates the process of mutual recognition of credit and certificate, which boosts the sharing of educational resources.Increased cultural exchanges, deeper mutual understandings, and diverse campus culture. International students help to form a more diverse and inclusive campus culture, and they can also be portrayed as cultural ambassadors to press ahead cooperation and exchanges between the host country and their home countries.The improvement of policies and practices. The presence of international students may shape higher education policies and practices to be more efficiency-, service-, and reputation-driven.The potential economic growth point.

Therefore, international education in China tends to be a practice of reciprocity, within the concept of the \u201cethics of care\u201d (Blackburn 1997; Abdullah et al. 2017), which suggests both parties (international students and HEIs) should ensure each party is involved in the benefits of internationalization from their interaction and have genuine concern over the well-being of each other in the provision of international education. In this sense, international education in China could be viewed as a global common good itself, since both parties need each other to achieve their intended goals, which thinks highly of collective endeavor, shared participation/engagement, inclusion, and responsibility, meshing with UNESCO\u2019s (2015) definition of global common goods.",

By examining various recent national policies and university strategies, it is easy to conclude that the inward student mobility has been given a special priority in the Chinese context. This reflects the positive attitude of both the Chinese government and HEIs, and contradicts the idea that the emphasis laid on international students is less in China, and the view that international students are less important to Chinese universities, because they are not seen as human resources due to their generally low academic performance (Jokila 2015).",

Obviously, this comment is not objective, because the findings of this study provide evidence that promoting mutual understandings and improving the quality of higher education through international education is an established strategy for the development of higher education in China, and this strategy does not exist in isolation. It falls in line with China\u2019s development goals of improving national soft power and cultural influence (Wang et al. 2014). Also, the neoliberals believe that China\u2019s efforts for educational improvement are characterized by export (Zheng 2010). This comment seems to simply equate the internationalization of higher education with a commercial trade activity, overlooking the internationalization of Chinese higher education contains unique cultural appeal. Chinese culture advocates \u201charmony in diversity\u201d and believes that different value systems should coexist harmoniously. According to our research findings, the dissemination of Chinese culture through international education is currently an important tool for China to build better political and economic relations with other countries, and the \u201cbridge\u201d is the international students who understand and respect Chinese culture, show kindness to China, and are on intimate terms with China. This is aligned with Schulte\u2019s (2012) idea that Chinese education actually takes place at the interface of global ideas and national strategies. Internationalization and nationalism are not necessarily in conflict with each other in China; instead, special cultural aspects could benefit from international relations (Gu 2001).",

Due to the different institutional needs and developmental goals in the process of internationalization, the university with lower degree of internationalization lays more emphasis on the quantity of international students, while the university with higher level of internationalization has shifted its focus from merely increasing the number of international students to improving the quality of international students as well as diversifying students\u2019 source countries. This strategy is supported by Wang et al.\u2019s (2014) study, which propose that the effectiveness international education strategy mainly hinges on the quality, not the number, of international students. Tellingly perhaps, the research results also illustrate that Z university gives close attention to attracting students from the Belt and Road countries. On the one hand, this is due to Z University\u2019s geographic location (it is located near the southern Chinese border) which makes it have a unique advantage to attract international students from neighboring NSR countries; on the other hand, this reflects that countries working with China on the Belt and Road initiative are likely to see more opportunities in educational cooperation and involvement (Chen and Wen 2018).",

But very recently, a few coastal metropolitan cities in China have re-tailored their policies on international student employment (but only for postgraduate students) to secure highly skilled international graduates, and potentially, these policies may be expanded to the whole country within the coming years.",

The findings of this study reveal that inward student mobility brings benefits to China and contributes to global common goods flowing worldwide, which can also be regarded as a reason for the supporting of national and institutional policies and strategies on international students. Though there are also some tensions in the policies and practices for international students (e.g., employment and management issues), relevant efforts have been exerted to address them. Most importantly, this study suggests that international education in China, as an essential part of higher education internationalization, can be seen as a global common good, which emphasizes collective endeavor, shared participation, inclusion, and responsibility. Nevertheless, the current coronavirus (COVID-19) threat may cast a shadow over booming international education in China and affect China\u2019s ability to attract more international students in a certain period. This puts forward new requirements for both countries and universities (not only China and Chinese universities) to raise awareness of the need for risk management and crisis response strategies to ensure sustainability that highlighted by UNESCO (2015) as an indispensable role and responsibility of diverse stakeholders in the collective quest for the common good.",
