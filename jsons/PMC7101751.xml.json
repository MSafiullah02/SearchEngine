Thoracic imaging showing diffuse bilateral infiltrates along with evidence of impaired gas exchange led to the diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Empirical antibacterial therapy was initiated in addition to the oseltamivir administration, and mechanical ventilation was required within the first 24 h of admission. Difficulties in oxygenation and deteriorating medical condition resulted in incremental positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) titrations to a maximal value of 18 cm H2O and plateau pressure titrations to 40 cm H2O with the goal of maintaining the partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial circulation (PaO2) above 55 mmHg. The infection progressed to bilateral diffuse airspace disease with severe hypoxemia during the next 70 days. High PEEP (>7 cm H2O, 32 days total) and high plateau pressures (>30 cm H2O, 54 days total) were necessary as rescue therapies given the severity of illness (Fig. 1).\n",

On day 62, the endothelin-1 receptor antagonist, bosentan, was given as an adjuvant-rescue therapy (31.25 mg through a nasogastric tube every 12 h) to rescue pulmonary hypertension. The patient had a rapid and sustained improvement in RVSP which was followed by a gradual improvement in oxygenation (Fig. 1). On day 86, the patient was able to be liberated from the ventilator successfully. Bosentan was stopped 17 days after discontinuing positive pressure ventilation and RVSP continued in a downward trend. Upon discharge, on hospital day 180, RVSP measurement was at low level, 37 mmHg.",

This chart shows the gradual increase in RVSP which was rescued on the day after bosentan (31.25 mg, every 12 h) was given. Also shown is the quickly increase of P/F ratio, along with RVSP restoring to the normal level. (A P/F ratio of <300 indicates abnormal oxygenation, and <200 severe hypoxemia.) Twenty-seven days before bosentan was given, PEEP requirements had already decreased and kept <5 cm H2O. Six days before bosentan was given, plateau pressure had decreased and was maintained <30 cm H2O until the patient was discontinued from ventilation on day 86",
