The OOPD provides incentives for the development of products (drugs, biologics, devices, medical foods) for the diagnosis and/or treatment of rare conditions, that is, diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the US or where developers/manufacturers are not expected to cover the costs of developing and marketing the agents. Since 1983, more than 400 drugs and biologic products for rare diseases have been brought to market under the Orphan Drug Designation programs, a marked increase over the 10 industry-supported products developed and marketed in the decade prior to 1983 [4].",

From 16 different antibodies with approved indications covering blood, solid tumor and skin cancers to a range of others specifically developed for the management of a variety of diseases including chronic asthma, cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome, macular degeneration, paroxymal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, autoimmune disorders such as Crohn\u2019s disease and rheumatoid arthritis, bone loss, psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus and prevention of organ rejection, mAb development continues to be extended and refined. The biotechnical advances, pharmacokinetics, clinical applications and adverse effects of these antibodies have been well reviewed [7\u201313]. Such close attention is yet to be directed at a relatively more slowly expanding list of cytokines [3, 14, 15], a number of which have been developed as orphan drugs and which are available in highly purified, well characterized recombinant form [1, 3, 4]. These biologics are generally reviewed, regulated and approved by the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) rather than the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research which retains regulatory responsibility for bacterial and human cellular products, gene therapy products, vaccines, allergenic extracts, antitoxins, antivenoms, blood, blood components and plasma-derived products. Side effects of the currently approved cytokines in the CDER biologic product list [1] (as at June 2014) are reviewed here together with summaries of each product\u2019s approved indications, properties and mechanism of action.",

Not surprisingly, clinical experience often reveals significant departures from the expected outcomes. Unlike small drug molecules, protein therapeutics are typically more complex and there is the possibility of heterogeneity due to changes in amino acid sequence, the presence and degree of glycosylation, folding, and protein-protein interactions. Even small differences which are often difficult to control can affect a protein\u2019s purity, specificity, potency and safety. Many proteins have a short half-life in plasma requiring frequent parenteral administration and ultimately poor patient compliance. This may be offset to at least some extent by the degree of glycosylation [18] and that, in turn, may affect the protein\u2019s activity, potency and immunogenicity (for examples see later",

            "text": "Cytokines, currently known to be more than 130 in number, are relatively small signaling proteins of MW < 30 kDa, usually glycosylated, and produced by a variety of different cells including those of the immune system, epithelia, endothelia and stroma. Cytokines are key modulators of the immune and inflammatory responses functioning in an autocrine, paracrine or endocrine manner stimulating or suppressing cellular activities in infection, innate and adaptive immunity, autoimmunity, inflammation and malignancy. Key to an understanding of these regulatory proteins is the recognition of their pleiotropism and sometimes overlapping activities, functional redundancies and side effects. Their secretion may be induced by an array of different stimuli associated with infection, inflammation or tumorigenesis, first releasing waves of (for example) pro-inflammatory molecules followed by anti-inflammatory cytokines to restore homeostasis. Cytokines therefore induce a diverse range of biological responses including proliferation, differentiation, activation, inflammation, chemotaxis and cell death and the nature of an immune or inflammatory stimulus determines whether an immune response is humoral- or cell-mediated, cytotoxic, immunosuppressive or allergic [15, 19\u201322].",

            "text": "The many attempts to classify cytokines over the last three decades and the complexities in devising classifications based on structural and/or functional parameters are not hard to understand given the sheer number of imprecisely defined \u2018factors\u2019 identified in the early years and the difficulties and work involved in trying to accumulate details on functions and diseases. In their discussion of the evolution of cytokine biology and nomenclature, Steinke and Borish [20] draw attention to three phases of development in the identification and classification of cytokines. The identification of cytokines by their biologic activities (e.g., T cell growth) occurred in the first, or factor, stage. The production of recombinant cytokines and demonstration of their pleiotropism and redundancy led to much of our current understanding and this can be called the recombinant-cloning or second phase. Currently, we are experiencing the third, or genomic phase, where cytokines are being identified on the basis of homology with known, characterized cytokines. In the more recent progressive assemblages published by Tato and Cua [23\u201326] detailing each cytokine\u2019s receptor(s), source, targets, major function and disease association, the first 16 interleukins were grouped in order of their discovery. Many of these interleukins form homodimeric structures and have the \u03b3c and/or \u03b2c chains in their receptors [23]. More recently discovered interleukins have proven more difficult to classify in relation to their function in health and disease due to the complexity of their heterodimeric ligands and receptors [24]. For example, a homotrimeric motif for ligands and receptors and bi-directional signaling was found to be an important feature of the TNF family [25]. It should be pointed out that many original names are still in use and many of the originally described \u2018factors\u2019 share receptors with other interleukins [26].",

Nine main families are recognized (Table 1) with most of the cytokines of interest classified in the hematopoietic growth factor, interferon (IFN), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) families. In the hematopoietin family, approved cytokines manufactured by recombinant DNA technology are aldesleukin [rh-interleukin-2 (IL-2)], oprelvekin (rhIL-11), filgrastim and tbo-filgrastim [rh-granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)], sargramostim [rh-granulocyte macrophage (GM)-CSF], metreleptin (rh-leptin) and rh-erythropoietins, epoetin and darbepoietin alfa. Anakinra, a recombinant receptor antagonist for IL-1, is a representative of the IL-1 cytokine family; interferon recombinants interferons alfa-1, alfa-2, beta-1 and gamma-1 make up the interferon family; palifermin [rh-keratinocyte growth factor (KGF)] and becaplermin (rhPDGF-BB; see Sect. 3.3.4) are in the PDGF family; and rh-bone morphogenetic protein [BMP]-2 and rhBMP-7 represent the TGF\u03b2 family. Chemokines, placed here in group 9 (Table 1), behave as regulatory molecules for leukocytes and lymphoid tissue and have an important role in infectious, inflammatory, allergic and autoimmune responses as well as angiogenesis, hematopoiesis and tumor growth [21, 22]. No members of the chemokine family are yet approved for therapy.\n",

            "text": "It is said that virtually all patients treated with interferon alfa experience some adverse effect(s) at some time during therapy [33]. In fact, the literature on side effects to interferons is voluminous and probably greater than all the other approved, non mAb biologics literatures put together. Three interferon alfa preparations are in the CDER Biologic Products List [1]. Peginterferon alfa-2a together with ribavirin (Copegus\u00ae) are indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in adults who have compensated liver disease and were not previously treated with interferon alfa. This drug combination is also the approved treatment of patients infected with hepatitis C and HIV and peginterferon alfa-2a alone is approved for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B who have compensated liver disease, viral replication and liver inflammation. Interferon alfa-2b is administered extensively for hepatitis B and C as well as several malignancies (Table 2) [114]. It upregulates the expression of MHC I proteins enhancing activation of CD8+ T cells and cytotoxic lymphocyte-mediated killing as well as inducing synthesis of several other antiviral agents including protein kinase R. Peginterferon alfa-2a and peginterferon alfa-2b are covalent conjugates of the recombinant interferon with a single branched bis-monomethoxy polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain, MW 40 kDa. Pegylation, which is FDA approved, non-toxic and contributes to water solubility, helps to protect the protein from immune recognition that is, it reduces the immunogenicity and antigenicity and increases the molecule\u2019s size thus extending protein half-life and circulatory time and reducing renal clearance [115]. For interferon alfa-2a, adverse events in patients treated with the pegylated form and ribavirin occur with a similar, or significantly less, frequency than those treated with standard interferon/ribavirin. For interferon alfa-2b, a number of adverse events occur more frequently with pegylated interferon/ribavirin [33]. In some reports on side effects, especially in the earlier literature, interferon alfa is often not distinguished as alfa-2a or alfa-2b although this can be important as demonstrated by some of the different effects induced by alfa-2a and alfa-2b interferons mentioned below.",

Other symptoms include altered sleep pattern, anorexia and fatigue. Of the patients who develop severe depressive symptoms, most occur within the first 3 months of treatment and the incidence of depressive disorders has been estimated to be 23\u201341 % [116\u2013118]. Symptoms may be prolonged for 6 months or more after the cessation of therapy. There is some evidence that the serotonergic system is involved in the pathophysiologic mechanism [119\u2013121] although the central opioid, dopamine and glutamate neurotransmitter systems may also be involved [122]. A positive correlation between depression scores and serum concentrations of soluble ICAM (intracellular adhesion molecule)-1 in patients who received interferon alfa led to the suggestion that the cytokine may induce the adhesion molecule which then increases the permeability of the blood-brain-barrier, allowing the interferon to more easily enter the brain [123]. A number of susceptibility factors have been suggested [124] including a history of depression; high dose of interferon; long treatment duration; female sex; and possession of the apolipoprotein E\u03b54 allele, said to be associated with some neuropsychiatric disorders.",

Cardiovascular complications such as pericarditis [132] and cardiomyopathy with left ventricular dilatation in patients with malignancies improved after withdrawal of the interferon and thereafter treatment with lower doses proved possible [133]. Pegylated interferon alfa-2b has been associated with acute myocardial infarction [134], pericarditis [135], pericardial effusion with tamponade [136] and sick sinus syndrome producing arrhythmias [137] and an orthotopic heart transplant patient died after allograft failure with death attributed to interferon toxicity [138]. Interstitial lung disease, reported for both interferon alfa-2a and 2b [139\u2013144], is seen more frequently with the former agent and with high doses of the latter [145]. Potentially fatal interstitial pneumonitis [146], secondary to interferon alfa-ribavirin therapy for hepatitis C infection, is said to have an incidence of 0.03\u20130.3 % although an incidence of ~1.1 % was found in 558 Japanese patients [147]. Fatal interstitial pulmonary disease can occur with pegylated interferon alfa-2b as shown by a patient with interstitial pneumonitis who also developing adult respiratory distress syndrome [148].

Adverse effects on sensory systems, mainly the eyes but also the ears, occur particularly to interferon alfa-2b. Ocular complications include occlusive vasculitis, central retinal artery occlusion and anterior ischemic optic retinopathy [159, 160]. Twenty seven of 42 patients taking interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin developed a retinopathy: cotton wool spots, 27 patients; retinal hemorrhage, 6; subconjunctival hemorrhage, 2; optic nerve edema, 1. Other ocular complications described in patients treated with interferon alfa-2b include permanent loss of sight due to combined retinal artery and central retinal vein obstruction; development of an epiretinal membrane; and the T cell-mediated autoimmune syndrome, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease [161].",

A flu-like illness is the most commonly occurring adverse event following administration of the interferon beta proteins (Table 2) and injection site reactions are common [43, 182]. A comparison of interferon beta-1a, 30 \u03bcg, given intramuscularly (im) once per week with interferon beta-1b, 44 \u03bcg, subcutaneously (sc) every other day, showed that injection site reactions and antibodies were significantly more frequent in patients given the beta-1b preparation but after 2 years, clinical outcomes to this agent were superior [183]. The questions of the production of neutralizing antibodies to interferon beta and whether they reduce the therapeutic effectiveness in treated patients, especially in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, are important ones. Such antibodies are found in about a quarter of patients treated with sc administered interferon beta-1b and the consensus is that they neutralize or reduce the cytokine\u2019s activity. Some believe that this has the potential to significantly reduce the effectiveness of the therapy and it has been suggested that the immunogenic potential of interferon beta should therefore be considered as well as its safety [184]. Other immunologic effects observed are cases of a lupus-like syndrome to both beta interferons [185, 186] and cutaneous lymphocytic vasculitis to sc interferon beta-1b [187].",

The occurrence of fatal acute respiratory failure in four patients treated with interferon gamma-1b for advanced idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [196] prompted further investigation in the form of a double blind study of the effect of the cytokine in 330 patients with that condition. No significant differences were found in lung function, gas exchange or quality of life but the patients experienced more frequent upper respiratory infections and pneumonia [197]. However, acute respiratory insufficiency has been reported in a single patient with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis four months after receiving interferon gamma [198]. Cardiovascular toxicity to interferon gamma, particularly at higher doses, and including hypotension, arrhythmias, coronary vasospasm and ventricular tachycardia [199, 200] and renal toxicity, namely acute renal failure, nephrotic syndrome and tubular necrosis [201, 202], have been recorded. There appears to be few reports of cutaneous reactions to interferon gamma but severe erythroderma occurred in 5 of 10 bone marrow transplant patients given the drug [203].",

Currently, approved members of the CSF family are filgrastim and pegfilgrastim, both G-CSFs, sargramostim, a GM-CSF, and tbo-filgrastim, a short acting biosimilar G-CSF (Table 2). The latter is used for severe neutropenia in patients with lung cancer receiving platinum drug chemotherapy.

Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following G-CSF [205] is more likely when a rapid rise in the white cells occurs in patients taking pulmonary toxic drugs, when there is concomitant infections and in patients with HLA-B51 or HLA-B52 antigens. Other occasional respiratory side effects are pulmonary toxicities, particularly pulmonary edema which has proved fatal [206], and interstitial pneumonitis [207]. There has been speculation that GM-CSF might contribute to the development of acute coronary syndrome. In fact, cardiovascular complications have been observed. These include fluid retention, pulmonary edema and weight gain [208], aortitis to molgramostim [209] and capillary leak syndrome following G-CSF which can be severe and even fatal [210]. Recorded hematologic side effects to CSFs consist mainly of a number of cases of thrombocytopenia, some with an immune mechanism, [211, 212], splenomegaly [211], and splenic rupture (note FDA issued warning, Table 2) [213]. There is a belief that G-CSF may be a risk for the progression of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) but this has not been unequivocally established. MDS has been reported after G-CSF treatment [214] and the incidence of MDS or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was found to be 11 % in patients treated with G-CSF but only 5.8 % in patients receiving immunosuppression alone [215]. In another more recent study [216], patients who received G-CSF had a 2.5-fold increased risk. Interpretation of results relevant to the alleged risk of G-CSF is not straight forward however. Findings that there is no significant relationship between G-CSF therapy and MDS/AML onset [217] are at odds with the belief that the risk of leukemia in severe congenital neutropenia patients increases with the G-CSF therapy [218]. Two other potentially life-threatening responses to CSFs, both the subject of warnings, are anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions [219] and severe adverse events such as acute chest syndrome, vaso-occlusive episodes, multi-organ failure and death seen in patients with sickle cell disease [220].",

Fluid retention and an increase in plasma volume underlie many of the adverse events, for example, edema, dyspnea, pleural effusions, arrhythmia and dilutional anemia, and indicate that oprelvekin should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure. No evidence of cumulative toxicity or bone marrow exhaustion has been observed after sequential cycles of the cytokine and no proliferative effect on tumors has been noted [66, 67, 232]. Two other clinically important adverse reactions reported are papilledema [67, 233] and periosteal bone formation [233].

In a retrospective study by the FDA of a medical claims database, cancer rates and deaths were compared for 1,622 becaplermin users and 2,809 matched non-users. The incidence rate ratios of becaplermin to matched controls for all cancers and for mortality from all cancers were 1.2 and 1.8, respectively and the incidence rates for mortality among patients who received 3 or more tubes of becaplermin and controls were 3.9 and 0.9 per 1,000 patient-years, respectively. The rate ratio for cancer mortality in the patient group receiving 3 or more tubes was 5.2 (95 % CI 1.6\u201317.60). Following an earlier safety study in 2001, where more cancers were found in the becaplermin group than a non-user group, the FDA in 2008 issued a boxed warning for Regranex\u00ae Gel stating that \u201cmalignancies distant from the site of application have occurred in becaplermin users\u2026 and an increased rate of death from systemic malignancies was seen in patients who have received 3 or more tubes\u201d. As a consequence, it was stated that \u201cbecaplermin should be used with caution in patients with known malignancy\u201d and only used \u201cwhen the benefits can be expected to outweigh the risks\u201d [239]. In 2010, the EMA\u2019s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use recommended that becaplermin should not be used in patients with a pre-existing cancer but, at the same time, admitted that there was no evidence either way to establish, or rule out, a link between therapeutic use of the cytokine and cancer. Apart from this major potential adverse event and the known side effects listed in Table 2, there is a dearth of subsequent studies on the side effects of becaplermin, including case reports. This is probably because clinical experience with the agent has not lived up to the initial high expectations and it has not become widely used.",

The recombinant form, called aldesleukin, differs from the natural cytokine by absence of glycan residues and at position 125 and the end terminal amino acid (Table 2). It has been applied clinically in a number of ways, particularly for melanoma and renal cell carcinoma, and from its earliest applications showed a wide range of the sort of side effects often seen with cytokines including fever, chills, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension, oliguria and edema [81, 240, 241] (Table 2) plus a number of more severe cardiovascular, hematologic [81], endocrine, kidney, central nervous system, infectious and cutaneous toxicities.",

An important occasional and serious adverse event of IL-2 therapy is capillary (sometimes called vascular) leak syndrome which causes hypovolemia and fluid accumulation in the extravascular spaces and may lead to oliguria, ischemia and confusion. Aldesleukin therapy can induce increased vascular permeability, interstitial edema and ultimately organ failure seen as an increase in body weight, fluid retention, peripheral edema, ascites, pleural and pericardial effusions and ultimately pulmonary and cardiovascular failure [245, 246]. Pulmonary side effects to aldesleukin are usually related to capillary leak syndrome and are more likely, and more severe, (e.g. as pulmonary edema and respiratory distress), in patients with existing cardiac problems. Hematologic adverse effects, particularly anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia [247, 248], occur but are rarely severe or dose limiting. Eosinophilia may occur in the later stages of therapy accompanied by rash and pruritus [245]. Endocrine effects usually manifest as hypothyroidism which may affect up to one third of patients, or as the far less common hyperthyroidism [249]. Renal toxicity [250], especially oliguria, and gastrointestinal toxicities are also seen, the latter being particularly common in the form of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, gastritis and mucositis. Gastrointestinal perforation has also been reported [251]. IL-2-induced infectious toxicities may occur at venous catheter sites and in the urinary tract. Such infections, usually due to Staphylococcus species, are thought to arise from the known affect of IL-2 on neutrophil chemotaxis. Neurological effects, especially to high doses during IL-2 therapy, include anxiety, depression, altered sleep patterns, somnolence, emotional fragility, vivid dreams and confusion [252]. The list of aldesleukin-induced cutaneous reactions is extensive, ranging from mild erythema, pruritus, injection site reactions and vitiligo, to urticaria, angioedema, reactivation of eczema, exacerbation of psoriasis, generalized erythema followed by desquamation, vasculitis, and severe manifestations like pemphigus, IgA bullous dermatosis and toxic epidermal necrolysis [5, 253, 254]. A curious case involved the implication of high dose IL-2 therapy in the occurrence of multifocal fixed drug eruptions after the administration of other drugs, namely, ondansetron, granisetron, paracetamol and indomethacin [255].",

            "text": "Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a cytokine produced in response to inflammatory stimuli in a number of immunological reactions including rheumatoid arthritis. The receptor for IL-1 (IL-1R), in membrane or soluble form, is widely expressed on tissues and organs and exists as two types, type I which is responsible for the expression of the inflammatory effects of IL-1 and type II which may compete for IL-1 and act as a suppressor of the cytokine. Anakinra is a recombinant specific receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) for IL-1 differing from the natural receptor by the addition of a single methionine at the amino terminal end (Table 2). Anakinra therefore acts as a biological response modifier in the treatment of diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. The side effects profile of anakinra is not large with two adverse events, injection site reactions (122 events per 100 patient years) [256] and infection episodes, the most commonly seen detrimental responses to the agent. Injection site reactions occur in up to 73 % of patients but cause cessation of treatment in less than 5 % of affected individuals. Infections, particularly upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), involving a wide variety of organisms have been reported but it has been suggested that the risk of infection is associated with high doses of anakinra and in patients with comorbidities. Septicemia due to S. aureus, hemolytic streptococci and E. coli occurred after anakinra was added to prednisolone for rheumatoid arthritis [257]. Anakinra provoked reactivation of pulmonary tuberculosis [258] and adenovirus, gastroenteritis, varicella pneumonitis, visceral leishmaniasis and acute Epstein-Barr virus infection occurred in juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients treated with anakinra [259]. A patient with Still\u2019s disease treated with anakinra developed systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) together with ARDS and some other patients with this disease had the cytokine withdrawn because of infections or severe skin reactions [260]. Other reported side effects of anakinra include progression of rheumatoid arthritis [256], exacerbation of Crohn\u2019s disease [261], anaphylaxis with a positive skin test to the cytokine [262], cellulitis at injection sites [263] and an interstitial granulomatous reaction which resolved after withdrawal of anakinra and recurred on challenge [264].",

Hypertension is a common side effect with approximately one third of dialysis patients affected [267] and hypertension and increased viscosity due to rhEPO may lead to encephalopathy, convulsions, cerebral edema and seizures [268]. Thromboembolism is said to be a potential outcome from EPO therapy but controlled studies have not always provided support for this claim [269]. Nevertheless, controlled studies on cancer patients revealed a 1.55-fold higher risk of thromboembolic events with rhEPO therapy than controls [270]. Cerebral ischemia with increased metabolic rate and blood viscosity is a potentially severe side effect of EPO therapy and it has been pointed out that this could limit or halt the use of EPO for neurovascular diseases [265]. EPO receptors have been demonstrated in tumor tissue and the cytokine may assist with tumor angiogenesis, suggesting the possibility of EPO initiating tumor growth or aiding tumor progression [271].",

More recent results with rhBMP-2 indicate a much higher incidence of side effects and complications than reported in the original peer reviewed and industry-sponsored work. No adverse events following rhBMP-2 administration were reported in thirteen of the original studies involving analyses of 780 patients due, it seems, to methodological bias against the control group. Identification of previously unpublished adverse effects, study inconsistencies, and a comparative review of FDA material, revealed an adverse events frequency associated with rhBMP-2 in spine fusion of 10\u201350 % [97]. In a retrospective review of adverse events associated with the use of rhBMP-2 in spinal surgery, a search of the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database for the period July 2002 to August 2011 was undertaken. Only 4 of 834 reports described procedures using rhBMP-2 in accordance with the approved indication while 370 reports (44.4 %) stated that the patient required revision surgery or other invasive interventions to deal with the adverse event. The adverse events reported were swelling; fluid collection; osteolysis; pain/radiculopathy; heterotropic bone; pseudarthrosis; surgical site infections and other wound complications; thromboembolic events; respiratory distress; cancer; and some others [98]. In an examination of the prevalence and complications of BMP use in spinal fusion procedures, Cahill et al. [278] identified the following complications and incidences: vertebral osteolysis 44 %; graft migration 31 %; graft subsidence 27 %; formation of neutralizing antibodies to BMP-2 26 %; ectopic/heterotopic bone formation 7 %; and hematoma 3 %.",

In posterior and transforaminal interbody fusions in particular, postoperative radiculitis may occur after BMP-2 use during lumbar spine surgery, occurring, it seems, without neural compression and possibly because of the formation of ectopic bone. Postoperative radiculitis was estimated to occur in 11.4 % of patients who underwent a minimally invasive transforaminal interbody fusion procedure [279]. Postoperative nerve injury and ectopic bone formation with the use of rhBMP-2 has been reported, the latter with an incidence of 20.8 % compared to 8.3 % in the absence of the cytokine. Other major adverse events seen following BMP-2 use in lumbar spine surgery include vertebral osteolysis, edema and retrograde ejaculation [99, 280]. Although the formation of neutralizing antibodies to the bone growth protein is a theoretical concern, there is so far no clinical evidence that that has occurred. Reviews of complications after the use of rhBMP-2 in cervical spine surgery have revealed an incidence of 43 % for osteolysis and graft subsidence and 5.5\u201317 % for dysphagia and swelling (in particular, the neck) with respiratory difficulties [278, 281]. Other adverse events include hematoma with high doses of rhBMP-2; lucency and subsidence of fusion levels amongst allograft and demineralized bone matrix patients; and complications in posterior cervical fusion with BMP such as neurologic decline, wound complications and asymptomatic heterotopic ossification [99].",

At \u226424 months cancer incidences were patients 5 % and controls 0.9 %; at 60 months, patients 5 %, controls 2.1 % [282]. Other studies have reported tumor-enhancing, tumor-suppressing, or no dependence effects [99, 283, 284] so, in this situation of uncertainty, it may be prudent to very carefully consider the question of the use of BMPs together with the risk to benefit ratio for cancer patients requiring spinal fusion.",

These hoped-for potential applications include identification and treatment of cancer, and a beneficial role in Parkinson\u2019s disease, ankylosing spondylitis, diabetes and asthma as well as some diseases of the kidney, liver, intestine, brain, adipose tissue and cardiovascular system [104]. Apart from an FDA Public Health Notification of life-threatening complications associated with rhBMP, including rhBMP-7, in cervical spine fusion, and the reminder that rhBMPs are contraindicated in skeletally immature or pregnant patients and those with hypersensitivity to the protein, studies on, and reports of, adverse events to BMP-7 are not yet extensive. This is in contrast to the large and rapidly growing literature on rhBMP-2 induced adverse events. In an early clinical trial designed to evaluate rhBMP-7 in the treatment of tibial reunions, adverse events were reported to be mild or moderate and non-serious, for example, fever, nausea and vomiting, leg edema and discomfort and hematoma at the operative site. Low levels of anti-BMP-7 antibodies were detected in 10 % of the treated patients but all titres were low with no related adverse events [285]. With the possibility in mind that risks following the use of rhBMP-7 in anterior cervical fusion procedures might not be as high as seen with BMP-2, the safety of rhBMP-7 was examined in 123 patients undergoing anterior cervical discectomy and fusion using interbody cages. Assessed over the first 30 days, there were no deaths or reoperations but 2.4 % of patients experienced brachalgia and dysphagia [286]. Although a slight increase on post-operative prevertebral swelling was seen on radiological evaluation, this was judged to be not clinically significant. The authors concluded that BMP-7 can be used safely in anterior cervical fusion surgery.",

It also regulates some neuroendocrine functions and other physiological processes, many yet to be defined. In February 2014, the FDA approved metreleptin, a recombinant analog of leptin (Table 2) as replacement therapy to treat leptin deficiency in patients with congenital or acquired generalized lipodystrophy. Metreleptin is not to be used in patients with general obesity, for HIV-related lipodystrophy or in patients with metabolic diseases (e.g., diabetes mellitus) without concurrent generalized lipodystrophy. Neutralizing antibodies may develop to metreleptin and because of this and the possibility of the occurrence of T cell lymphoma in patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy, the protein is only available under the Myalept Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy Program.",

            "text": "Cytokines have already had a revolutionary impact on our understanding of cellular functions and extracellular messaging but although their biological effects seem to offer great potential for the treatment of a wide range of human conditions, their pleiotropism, potency, and complexity to produce cytokine \u2018cocktails\u2019 with signaling cascades and accompanying side effects, demands caution in attempts to introduce individual members into the clinic. The range of biological events set in motion even by individual cytokines, warns of the possibility of unwanted side effects and the resultant caution is reflected by the relatively small number of cytokines currently approved by regulatory agencies and reviewed here. Good examples of the sorts of doubts that exist and why clinical developments proceed so cautiously, have been illustrated with interferons, aldesleukin, becaplermin, palifermin and bone morphogenetic proteins. A glance at Table 2 shows that 14 of the 20 listed FDA-approved cytokine preparations (18 different cytokines with 3 also in pegylated form) carry warnings with 10 of these being black box warnings. Having been used in human therapy for many years, interferon alfa preparations are well known for a number of often widely different, potentially serious, side effects specified in boxed warnings. The diverse nature of these side effects concerning neuropsychiatric, autoimmune, ischemic and infection adverse events, together with the therapeutic benefits of interferons are a good illustration of the two-edged nature of cytokine pleiotropism. Becaplermin, a growth factor, causes cell proliferation so the possibility of malignancy with its continued use needs to be kept in mind, especially in patients with known cancers. Likewise, palifermin, another growth factor and a valuable treatment for mucositis in cancer patients, has with it the potential for stimulation of tumor growth, especially since its complementary receptors occur widely on many different cell types in the body. Aldesleukin, the recombinant IL-2, is a potent activator of T lymphocytes and stimulates immune responses to cancer, producing regression of tumors in metastatic renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. However, this activity can also lead to a range of adverse cardiac and pulmonary events. Perhaps the best example of the safety uncertainties and benefits-to-risk ratios associated with these heterogeneous, pleiotropic cell regulators, is seen with the bone morphogenetic proteins BMP-2 and BMP-7. Already with a troubled history of under-reported adverse events, in the post-marketing period these growth factors are currently a focus of attention and speculation as potential carcinogens. BMP-2 receptors are expressed on some tumor cells and increased rates of cancer following its use have been reported but, in keeping with the complexity of cytokine-induced responses, and the difficulty of ascribing adverse effects to causes, tumor-suppressing or no dependence effects have also been reported.",

The dose of a particular cytokine may also be of critical importance in avoiding dangerous side effects by narrowing the spectrum of activity of the pleiotropic agent and tipping the balance to a specific biological activity [15].",

Cytokines may indeed sometimes provoke a wide range and number of toxicities and adverse events but, overall, the second edge of their pleiotropism usually more than offsets the side effects profiles and this is reflected in their lists of indications and approved regulatory status. In fact, in some cases, toxicities correspond with improved outcomes. For example, in an assessment of the significance of autoimmunity in melanoma patients treated with interferon alfa-2b, interferon-induced autoimmunity was found to be a prognostic marker for improved relapse-free, and overall, survival [294].",

Meanwhile, the relatively few currently approved recombinant cytokines are already revealing their true natures in relation to their efficacy and side effects, influenced above all by their pleiotropism, redundancies and potencies. The large range of activities displayed by the family of cytokine proteins, together with their potential for the treatment of many different diseases and our steadily accumulating knowledge and experience with the small number currently used clinically, may indeed end up helping to achieve the prediction that the future of therapy belongs to the emerging biologics.",
