            "text": "Although vaccines have been very successful in controlling many viral diseases, some diseases are likely to be controlled only by antiviral chemotherapy. The concept of antiviral drugs has only been accepted slowly, partly because of the toxicity of many of the earlier antiviral agents. In contrast to the development of antibiotics, attempts to develop antiviral drugs have indeed met a variety of problems. Being strictly dependent on cellular metabolic processes, viruses possess only limited intrinsic enzyme systems and building blocks that may serve as specific targets for a drug. Moreover, contrary to a bacteriostatic compound, an effective antiviral drug should not only display considerable specificity in its antiviral action, but should also irreversibly block viral synthesis in order to stop cell suicide due to the viral infection and restore normal cell synthesis (Vanden Berghe et al., 1986). In addition to this inhibition, the antiviral agent must have a broad spectrum of activity, favorable pharmacodynamic properties, and not be immunosuppressive. In the ideal situation, the antiviral drug checks the infection while the immune system prepares to destroy the last virus particles (Munro et al., 1987). This point is critical for those immune-compromised by illness (AIDS, cancer) or drug therapy (transplants, cancer). A frequent cause of death in these instances is from viral infections, so that adjuvant antiviral chemotherapy is vital in these circumstances (Shannon and Schabel, 1980).",

Methisazone (25 mg/kg) was found to inhibit Variola virus in mice and was later used successfully to treat cases of eczema vaccinatum and to treat and prevent smallpox. Kaufman et al. (1962), an ophthalmologist, successfully treated a herpes eye infection with an antineoplastic drug, Idoxuridine. At the same time, a group of chemists at the Du Pont chemical company in the United States investigated the antiviral activity of a molecule called Amantadine. It was active against influenza virus type A. In rapid succession, further nucleoside analogs, cytosine arabinoside, trifluorothymidine, and adenine arabinoside, were found to inhibit herpes virus. In the 1970s, the antiherpes activity of a new compound, 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl) guanine (Acyclovir), was detected by J. Bauer at the Wellcome Research Labs. Within a decade, the same group was to discover azidothymidine (Zidovudine), the first effective inhibitor of the newly emerged HIV. The alkaloid from the Australian horse chestnut (Castanospermine australe), isolated in the 1980s, was also found to be active against HIV.",

The antiviral screening system should meet all requirements of any good assay, including validity, lack of ambiguity, accuracy, reproducibility, simplicity, and reasonable cost. Moreover, because we are dealing with plant extracts, the antiviral screen should be highly selective, specific, and sensitive; it is advisable to discriminate a true antiviral activity from a viricidal one at this stage. Because most of the aforementioned requirements are better met by in vitro testing, we not only prefer in vitro screening of the plant extracts, but also the use of the same bioassay to guide the isolation of the antivirally active compounds from the plant extracts. The antiviral activity of the pure compounds then has to be confirmed in a later stage by in vivo assays (Leven et al., 1982, Vanden Berghe et al., 1986).",

To screen each and every plant or their individual parts for the identification of antiviral components is a huge task. Several examples of plants having antiviral properties and newly identified active compounds from them are reported in various journals. One of the examples that can be cited here is cyanovirin N (CV-N), an 11-kDa protein isolated from the cyanobacterium Nostoc ellipsosporum, which exhibits the property of inhibiting HIV-1 infection and also possesses broad-spectrum activity. The phytochemical, Podophyllotoxin, isolated from the aqueous extract of Podophyllum peltatum L., inhibited HSV type 1 (HSV-1) (Bedows and Hatfield, 1982). The acetone extract of another plant, Phyllanthus urinaria, also suppressed HSV-2 and HSV-1 (Yang et al., 2007). Bessong et al. (2006) reported a comparison of various plants and their individual parts (stem, leaves, roots, and so forth.) in repressing viral reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase, the two basic enzymes in HIV disease. After comparing all the extracts and fractions of the various plants, it was found that the n-butanol fraction of Bridelia micrantha (Hochst) exhibited the highest anti-RT activity. It has also been reported that the aqueous extract from the roots of Carissa edulis (Forssk.) Vahl, a plant grown in Kenya, displayed noteworthy activity against HSV for both wild type and resistant strains (Tolo et al., 2006). Polyphenol-rich extract from the medicinal plant Geranium sanguineum L. has been reported to show a strong antiinfluenza virus activity, as well as antioxidant and radical scavenging capacities (Sokmen et al., 2005)",

Despite the fact that presentation to any of these infections prompts intense disease, in any case, types B, C, and D are unique in causing chronic infection. Plants belonging to the genus Phyllanthus of the Euphorbiaceae family were extensively used as a traditional remedy against these infections. Clinical investigations were additionally intended to look at the inhibitory effects of different species of Phyllanthus, that is, P. amarus (L.), P. niruri (L.), and P. urinaria (L.) (Wang et al., 1995). The screening of 56 different Chinese medicinal herbs led to the identification of two potent plant extracts against Duck hepatitis B virus, namely, Ardisia chinensis and Pithecellobium clypearia (Leung et al., 2006). Similarly, this also led to the identification of Oenanthe javanica (Blume) DC flavones (OjF). They acted as a strong inhibitor of HBsAg and HBeAg secretion (involved in viral pathogenesis) in 2.2.15 cells and also reduced DHBV-DNA levels in the HBV-infected duck model (Wang et al., 2005). Because of the strong prevalence of HCV infection in poor countries, screening for the identification of anti-HCV potentials from medicinal plants are still ongoing. According to Hussein et al.

Willd ex Delile, Boswellia carterii, Embelia schimperi, Quercus infectoria, Trachyspermum ammi L., and aqueous extracts of Piper cubeba L., Q. infectoria, and Syzygium aromaticum L., were found to possess significant inhibitory activity against HSV.",

Such combination therapies have also been tried for the inhibition of viral hepatitis. As an example, a Chinese herbal medicine, prepared by liquid fermentation broth of Ganoderma lucidum supplemented with an aqueous extract of Radix Sophorae flavescentis, was potent against hepatitis B virus activity in vitro and in vivo. Viral infections are a matter of great concern for this planet. Plants having broad-spectrum activity against many viruses could be evaluated for isolation and identification of molecules for treating viral infections. As an example, glycyrrhizin, a bioactive component of licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch), and lycorine, isolated from Lycoris radiata L., showed strong anti-SARS-CoV activity, and was initially used for treating other indications (Li et al., 2005a, Li et al., 2005b).",

This is due chiefly to the complexity of the different techniques involved in such research, which consequently requires the know-how and dedication of a multidisciplinary team. Nevertheless, many antiviral agents have been isolated from natural sources and partly or completely characterized. From these studies, several substances have emerged as true antivirals having a good chemotherapeutic index based on the viability of infected cells and on in vivo tests. Thus, different 3-methoxy flavones and synthetic derivatives have shown to be promising leads for the development of antirhinovirus drugs (Van Hoof et al., 1984; Vlientinck et al., 1988), whereas the spanonin, glycyrrhizic acid, was found to be highly active in vitro against herpes simplex (Pompei et al., 1979), varizella-zoster (Baba and Shijeta, 1987), and human immunodeficiency viruses (Ito et al., 1987). Whether these compounds have any clinical potential, that is, in the therapy of the corresponding viral diseases, remains to be determined. There, in vivo bioavailability and other pharmacokinetic parameters are subjects of future study.",

            "text": "Because of the problems of drug resistance stated earlier and of side effects, the pharmaceutical industry is looking forward toward natural products (mainly medicinal plant extracts) as a source of possible antiviral agents. Approximately 2500 medicinal plant species have been recorded globally to treat a myriad of inflictions and diseases. Polyphenols, alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, quinones, terpenes, proanthocyanidins, lignins, tannins, polysaccharides, steroids, thiosulfonates, and coumarins are prominent bioactive phytochemicals that have been observed to combat viral infections, as they are harmless to the systems of the human body. Some selected anthraquinones and anthraquinone derivatives are noted for their antiviral and viricidal activities against viruses representing several taxonomic groups. One of these compounds, hypericin, has activity against vesicular stomatitis virus, HSV types 1 and 2, parainfluenza virus, and vaccinia virus (Andersen et al., 1991). The mechanism of inhibition of HIV-1 infection by purified extracts of Prunella vulgaris in the lymphoid cell line MT-4, in the monocytoid cell line U-937, and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells is that it antagonizes HIV-1 infection by preventing HIV-1 viral attachment to the CD-4 receptor (Yao et al., 1992). The mannose-specific lectins from the orchid species Cymbidium hybrid, Epipactis helleborine, and Listera ovata were highly inhibitory to HIV-1 and HIV-2 in MT-4 and showed a marked anti-HCMV, antirespiratory syncytial virus and antiinfluenza A virus activity in HEL, HeLa, and MDCK cells, respectively (Balzarini et al., 1992). Five Australian Phyllanthus species have been found to have an antiviral effect on the duck hepatitis B virus endogenous DNA polymerase (Shead et al., 1992). Hudson and Towers (1995) noted the influence of reaction parameters on antiviral assays of phytochemicals.\n",

The inhibitory effect of ferulic acid and isoferulic acid on murine interleukin-8 production in response to influenza virus infections in vitro has been reported (Hirabayashi et al., 1995) and the effect of isoferulic acid was found to be greater than that of ferulic acid. Hayashi et al. (1995) found a direct inhibitory activity of the steam distillate prepared from fresh plants of Houttuynia cordata (Saururaceae) against HSV-1, influenza virus, and HIV-1, without showing cytotoxicity, but not against Poliovirus and Coxsackie virus. Montanha et al. (1995a) evaluated the action of a series of 19 Aporphine alkaloids against HSV-1 in cell cultures. On the basis of viral titer reduction, six alkaloids were found to be active. Ellagitannins isolated from Phyllanthus myrtifolius and P. urinaria (Euphorbiaceae) showed activity against Epstein\u2013Barr virus DNA polymerase. Flavonoidal constituents, such as biflavonoids and robustaflavones, exhibited strong inhibitory effects against influenza A and B viruses. The antiviral potential of the flavonoids of Chamaesyce thymifolia has been reported; they showed high cytotoxicity on HEp-2 cells and moderate inhibitory activity against HSV-1 and bovine viral diarrhea virus (Amaral et al., 1999). Sotanaphun et al. (1999) isolated Sclerocarpic acid from the stem bark of Glyptopetalum sclerocarpum, which exhibited antiviral activity against Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Rhamnan sulfate, a natural sulfated polysaccharide isolated from Monostroma latissimum, showed potent inhibitory effects on the virus replication of HSV-1, HCMV, and HIV-1 in vitro (Lee et al., 1999). Matsuse et al. (1999) tested aqueous and methanolic extracts of 39 Panamanian medicinal plants for anti-HIV effects. Seven of these were found to be moderate inhibitors of HIV-protease enzyme. Serkedjieva and Ivancheva (1999) investigated the inhibitory effect of five extracts from the Bulgarian medicinal plant G. sanguineum on Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Yoosook et al. (1999) evaluated the anti-HSV-2 activities of Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans. The results suggested a therapeutic potential against HSV-2 for B. lupulina, but not for C. nutans. The antiviral activities of various water and methanol soluble substances isolated from G. lucidum against HSV types 1 and 2, influenza A virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus were studied using cytopathic effect inhibition assay and plaque reduction assay (Eo et al., 1999). Kudi and Myint (1999) investigated the antiviral activity of medicinal plant extracts against Poliovirus, Astrovirus, HSV, and Parvovirus. Most of the extracts showed activity against more than one virus at a dose rate of between 100 and 400 \u03bcg/100 \u03bcL (Eo et al., 1999). Bourne et al. (1999) assessed 19 plant products in vitro by plaque reduction assay to determine their activity against a commonly transmitted pathogen, Herpes Simplex virus type 2. Docherty et al. (1999) found that Resveratrol, a phytoalexin, inhibited HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication in a dose-dependent reversible manner.",

Many substances that are present in only trace quantities and are difficult to purify have been studied chemically; for example, the demonstration of xylose-bearing derivatives is new in this series of compounds.

It has been observed that many nonpolar plant extracts, prepared and evaporated, are reasonably soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), especially if little or no water is present in the sample and the dissolving sample is heated on a water bath. Viricidal and antiviral determinations may then be carried out on test solutions containing not more than 10% and 1% DMSO, respectively. Therefore, dissolved samples of nonpolar plant extracts in DMSO are added dropwise to the maintenance medium in a ratio of 1:10 or 1:100 under stirring. As already mentioned, the maintenance medium may contain antibiotics, such as penicillin G (20 \u03bcg mL\u2212 1), neomycin (1 \u03bcg mL\u2212 1), and amphotericin B (1 \u03bcg mL\u2212 1), in order to avoid sterilization of the test solutions.

Starting with monolayers containing 104 cells per hole and a virus suspension of, for example, 107 TCID50 mL\u2212 1 or PFU mL\u2212 1, infect the first monolayers of cells with a multiplicity of infection (MOI). The antiviral activity is expressed as the virus titer reduction at the maximal nontoxic dose (MNTD) of the test substance, that is, the highest concentration (\u03bcg mL\u2212 1) that does not affect the monolayers under the antiviral test condition. Viral titer reduction factors, that is, the ratio of the viral titer reduction in the absence (virus control) and presence of the MNTD of the test sample of 1 \u00d7 103 to 1 \u00d7 104 indicate a pronounced antiviral activity and are suitable as selection criteria for further investigation of plant extracts (Colegate and Molyneux, 1993). The EPTT is more suitable for testing complex samples, such as plant extracts, for many reasons.(i)First, the concentration of many compounds in the extract remains constant, and consequently the proportion of toxic versus active compounds does not change.(ii)Second, the exact duration of the antiviral action can be determined by using the EPTT, because the action starts from the moment the extract is added to the cells.(iii)Third, the EPTT using serial diluted extracts deals with a dynamic process, because the cells are subsequently infected with different MOI.(iv)This system allows the correlation of all possible MOI values in the same microtiter plate with decreasing amounts of plant extracts, so that the noncytotoxic concentration of plant extracts can be determined. At the same time, a correlation between extract toxicity and antiviral activity according to the corresponding MOI can be determined in the same microtiter plate.(v)It can be stated as a general rule that the detected antiviral activity should be stable in at least two subsequent dilutions of nontoxic concentration of the extract; otherwise the activity is directly correlated with the toxicity of the extract or is only viricidal. Moreover, a true antiviral product has to protect the cells, which have been infected with low virus dilutions (starting from 0.1 PFU per cell onward).(vi)Finally, it should be stressed that all possible steps of virus manipulation are to be completed before the plant extracts are added. This means that an antiviral product TCD50 mL\u2212 1), under nontoxic conditions, must act on virus replication steps after uncoating. When the cells are completely protected only in the lower MOI (0.1 TCD50 mL\u2212 1), replication processes before uncoating may be involved.\n",

After washing the wells with ice-cold PBS, fix with prechilled 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h on ice, blocked with 5% BSA at 4\u00b0C. The samples are incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h with a primary antibody in PBST PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 along with 5% BSA. The wells are washed twice with PBST, 5% BSA, and again only with PBST twice, at 5-min intervals on a shaker. This is mixed with secondary antibody in PBST with 5% BSA and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. The reaction is developed with a 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethyl-benzidine two component microwell peroxidase substrate for 20 min; the reaction is stopped with 1 M phosphoric acid. The absorbance is measured at 450 nm, and the values are expressed as the fold change of absorbance relative to the mock infection control (Lin et al., 2011).",

The currently accessible antivirals, however effective, are exorbitant and past the reach of a majority of individuals. Along these lines, the advancement of safe, effective, and low-cost antiviral medications, for example, RT inhibitors, is among the top priorities, as many viral infections are not yet treatable and have high death rates. For the past few years, substantial work has been carried out regarding the effectiveness of medicinal plants on HIV infection (Premanathan et al., 1999; Calabrese et al., 2000; Asres et al., 2001) and an increasing popularity of over-the-counter plant products containing orthodox drugs has been observed. The main focus is to lower the adverse effects associated with viral infections and an inclination toward synergistic interactions of multiple molecules present in plant extracts. Be that as it may, because mostly pharmacological mechanisms of the combinations are not studied, antagonistic impacts or remedial disappointments have been seen (Chan et al., 2000). A prerequisite that should be considered significant for medicinal plants is to identify and standardize the method of extract preparation, the suitable season for collecting plant material, and the details of its administration (Chattopadhyay et al., 2006). As a lot of plant extracts and subsequent formulations have shown significant outcomes, it seems to be rational to endorse the idea of the study of medicinal plants as a quest to find potential antivirals.",
