It was found that those phenolic acids especially isochlorogenic acids in Flos Lonicerae were the main bioactive components for antioxidant, antiviral and antibacterial effects by \u201cSpectrum-activity relationship\u201d and \u201cKnock-out/Knock-in\u201d methods [5], [6]. Besides, we also found that the oral bioavailability of chlorogenic acid in Flos Lonicerae, the indicator compound recorded in Chinese Pharmacopeia [7], was enhanced largely as the Chito-oligosaccharide at the dosage of 25 mg/kg, one of the most important absorption enhancers possessing a loosening effect on the tension of the tight junctions through ionic interactions with negatively charged groups of glycocalix [8], was added, and its antiviral activity in vitro was improved significantly [4]. Thus, phenolic acids might be one of the most important compositions to characterize the quality of Flos Lonicerae. In order to elucidate the action mechanism of phenolic acids in vivo, it is essential to develop a quantitative method for determining these phenolic acids in plasma samples and studying their pharmacokinetic profiles.",

However, apart from chlorogenic acid, simultaneous pharmacokinetic studies of other phenolic acids have not been reported after oral administration of Flos Lonicerae preparations in rats, and very little attention has been devoted to the pharmacokinetic studies of these components. In the previous pharmacokinetic studies of chlorogenic acid, its concentration in plasma was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV, ECD or MS [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. However, Flos Lonicerae contains a series of phenolic acids that have isomer properties with different pharmacological activities [18] shown in Fig. 1\n. Therefore, it was desirable to develop an analytical method to allow the five analytes to be quantified simultaneously in rat plasma.",

The results above indicated that there were differences of caffeoylquinic acids containing neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid and cryptochlorogenic acid as isomers and dicaffeoylquinic acids containing 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid and 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid as isomers in the pharmacokinetic parameters, although they had similar physicochemical properties.
