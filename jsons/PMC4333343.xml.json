            "text": "Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), as a commensal disease, often occurs in children under the age of 10, and can be observed in adolescents and adults on occasion. The common pathogens of HFMD are EV71 and coxsackievirus A16 (CA16). EV71 belongs to the Picornaviridae family, and is characterized by a single-stranded positive RNA genome. Compared with CA16, EV71 often causes aseptic meningitis, encephalomyelitis, and acute flaccid paralysis, and even death [1, 2]. Generally, viruses can only survive in host cells, so it is difficult to develop effective drugs specifically against viruses without the damage on host cells. Currently, several kinds of drugs including interferons, antiviral chemicals, and vaccines have been developed to treat EV71 infection. However, the treatment efficacy of these developed drugs for EV71 infection is still not confirmed yet [3].",

            "text": "\nPolygonum cuspidatum (P. cuspidatum), a traditional Chinese herb, has been used as analgesic, anti-pyretic, diuretic and expectorant agents in clinical practice for long time. Resveratrol and polydatin (piceid), the major active components in P. cuspidatum, are confirmed to have pharmacological actions in cardiovascular protection, neuroprotection, anti-inflammation, immunoregulation, anti-oxidation, anti-tumor, and liver and lung protection [4]. Moreover, resveratrol reveals inhibitory activity on a wide variety of viruses including HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus), HSV-1 (herpes simplex virus), HSV-2, VZV (varicella-zoster virus) and HCMV (human cytomegalovirus), suggesting that this chemical agent can interfere with infection by altering signal pathways in cells rather than acting directly against the virus itself [5\u20138]. Polydatin is the most abundant form of resveratrol in nature, and can be extracted from grapes, peanuts, hop cones, red wine and chocolate products as well as many daily diets [9]. Previous studies have demonstrated that polydatin has many physiological properties such as anti-platelet aggregation, antioxidant activity of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory and immune-regulating functions [10\u201314]. However, the antiviral activity of polydatin on EV71 is unknown.",

The results demonstrated that resveratrol could effectively protect from EV71-infected RD cells and inhibit EV71 replication in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. In addition, resveratrol reduced the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 by blocking the phosphorylation of IKKs/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway molecules.

After incubation for 48 h, the inhibitory rate of polydatin on EV71 replication at the concentration of 300 \u03bcg/ml was 23.57 \u00b1 3.64% with IC50 of 979.66 \u03bcg/ml. No difference in CPE inhibition rate between the virus attachment and co-culture groups was observed (Fig. 2A). Resveratrol could significantly inhibit CPE on EV71 infection. The inhibitory activity of resveratrol on EV71 replication within 48 h revealed a concentration-dependent manner (\u226440 \u03bcg/ml), and the IC50 of resveratrol on EV71 replication was 21.36 \u03bcg/ml. Furthermore, resveratrol didn\u2019t show any difference between the virus attachment and co-culture groups either (Fig. 2B). Time course experiments were conducted to determine the time point of polydatin and resveratrol for inhibiting EV71 replication. Polydatin (200 \u03bcg/ml), resveratrol (30 \u03bcg/ml) or ribavirin (125 \u03bcg/ml) was added after EV71 absorption for 1.5 h. The results indicated that the addition of ribavirin or resveratrol significantly suppressed EV71 replication at 8, 12 and 24 h p.i. Compared with the control, no difference between resveratrol and ribavirin was observed, while polydatin (200 \u03bcg/ml) presented a slight inhibitory effect on EV71 replication at 24 h p.i. (Fig. 2C). As mentioned above, the antiviral activity of polydatin was weak, thereby we only further analyzed whether resveratrol could interfere with the protein synthesis of EV71/VP1. Approximately 5 \u00d7 106 of RD cell-infected with EV71 (MOI = 2) were treated with resveratrol at the dose of 30 \u03bcg/ml. Results indicated that the expression of EV71/VP1 protein remarkably increased at 8, 12 and 24 h p.i., respectively. However, EV71/VP1 was significantly reduced in the presence of resveratrol (30 \u03bcg/ml) at 8, 12 and 24 h p.i., suggesting that resveratrol could effectively inhibit viral replication in EV71-infected RD cells (Fig. 2D).",

During viral infection, although the activation of NF-\u03baB is frequently associated with the protective response of host cells to viral pathogens, some viruses such as EV71, influenza A virus and HSV-1 require the activation of NF-\u03baB signal pathway for efficient viral replication [18\u201320]. In the present study, EV71 infection promoted the phosphorylated levels of IKK\u03b1, IKK\u03b2, and IKK\u03b3 in RD cells at 4, 8, 12 and 24 h p.i., but they revealed a significant reduction in the presence of resveratrol (30 \u03bcg/ml) (Fig. 3). Meanwhile, the increased phosphorylation levels of IKB\u03b1, NF-\u03baB p50, and NF-\u03baB p65 in EV71-infected RD cells were inhibited by resveratrol (30 \u03bcg/ml) (Fig. 4).

EV71 is a virus with the characteristics of genetic diversity and rapid evolution. Drug resistance due to viral mutation could be developed soon after chemotherapy.

Resveratrol (3,4,5-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a phenolic compound produced by various family members of spermatophytes such as grapes, peanuts and P. cuspidatum. In recent years, resveratrol has been gained extensive attention due to its wide variety of preventive function for cardiovascular diseases and cancer, and the control function for bacterial and viral infections [28\u201330].

EV71 is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus encoding four capsid proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4) and seven nonstructural proteins (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, VPg, 3C, and 3D) [40].

In this study, the protein synthesis of VP1 significantly increased in EV71-infected RD cells at 8, 12 and 24 h p.i., respectively.

In the resting condition, the NF-\u03baB p50/p65 heterodimer is in an inactive state in the cytoplasm and binds to the inhibitory molecule I\u03baB\u03b1 (inhibitor of NF-\u03baB). After the stimuli of bacterial and viral infections, the upstream IKK complex including IKK\u03b1, IKK\u03b2 and IKK\u03b3 can phosphorylate I\u03baB\u03b1 to result in its release from NF-\u03baB and degradation via ubiquitin proteasome pathway. In recent years, resveratrol has been extensively explored, and demonstrated its role in the regulation of crucial cellular processes such as cell cycle, apoptosis and inflammatory responses [43\u201345]. In our study, EV71 infection gradually activated the phosphorylation of IKK\u03b1, IKK\u03b2 and IKK\u03b3, then IKB\u03b1, NF-\u03baB p50 and NF-\u03baB p65 were phosphorylated in turn. Subsequently, NF-\u03baB might translocate into the nucleus to bind the promoters of target genes and accelerate the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1. On the other hand, the level of IL-2 did not reveal the change in EV71-infected RD cells. Subjected to the pretreatment of resveratrol, the phosphorylation of IKKs/NF-kB pathway molecules could be significantly inhibited, while the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 revealed the reduction in EV71-infected RD cells. According to previous reports, resveratrol is involved in the regulation of many signal pathways such as the pathways of NF-\u03baB, EGFR and SIRT1 activation for antiviral defense in different cells [8, 46, 47]. The activation of NF-\u03baB signal pathway may be efficient for viral replication, such as EV71, influenza A virus and HSV-1. Our results indicate that resveratrol can effectively protect the response of host cells to EV71 infection by targeting NF-\u03baB signal pathway, inhibit inflammatory reaction and extenuate the damage of RD cells.",

Moreover, these anti-viral interventions display certain protective or therapeutic effects when given either before or after EV71 infection that include the reductions in morbidity, mortality, tissue virusloads and the alleviation of lesions. Although resveratrol has little cytotoxicity and shows the inhibitory effect on EV71 replication in vitro, the efficiency should be further evaluated on animal models in the follow-up study. In addition, resveratrol can be rapidly metabolized to glucuronide or sulfate compounds with low bioavailability on first pass after oral administration, which seems to be difficult in clinical application. Therefore, resveratrol may serve as a lead for chemical modification and a suitably modified analogue as a clinical candidate.",

Whereas, the activation of the signal pathway and EV71 replication can be blocked by resveratrol, suggesting that it is effective to inhibit EV71 infection through blocking IKKs/NF-\u03baB pathways.
