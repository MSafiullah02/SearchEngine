            "text": "Human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63, the member of the genus alphacoronavirus in the Coronaviridae family, is one of common human coronaviruses (Li and Lin, 2013; Huang et al., 2017). HCoV-NL63 genome is a positive-strand RNA with near 27.5 kb nucleotides containing 5\u2032 untranslated regions (UTR), ORF1a/b, spike(S), ORF3, envelope(E), membrane(M), nucleoprotein (N), and 3\u2032UTR (Geng et al., 2012). ORF1a/b encodes overlapping replicase 1a and 1ab via the \u22121 ribosomal frameshift at the nucleotide 12,424. The papain-like (PLpro) and 3C-like (3CLpro) proteases embedded within replicase 1a and 1ab process cis- and trans-cleavage activity to divide replicase 1a and 1ab into nonstructural proteins (nsps) that modulate in viral RNA replication. Among common human coronaviruses like HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 is one of main circulating HCoVs in the fall and winter worldwide, causing mild upper respiratory tract illnesses like runny nose, cough and sore throat in young children, young adults and elderly (Cui et al., 2011; Dijkman et al., 2012). Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 has been frequently detected than other HCoVs, influenza viruses, and rhinovirus in the specimens from the young adults with acute respiratory infection (cough and body aches or chills or fever/feverishness) (Davis et al., 2018). Importantly, HCoV-NL63 is also associated with lower respiratory tract illnesses, such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis in young children and elderly (Huang et al., 2017). HCoV-NL63 infection is the high prevalence (8.4%) in hospitalized patients with pneumonia in winter. Recently, a severe respiratory illness outbreak in a long-term care facility in Louisiana has been reported to be associated with the HCoV-NL63 infection in winter 2017 (Hand et al., 2018). Among 20 cases aged from 66 to 96, 6 patients with pneumonia have to be hospitalized and 3 patients are dead. Moreover, screening children with acute undifferentiated febrile illness in rural Haiti indicates that HCoV-NL63 is identified in the blood samples from four patients aged from 3 to 10 years who have no respiratory symptom, but two cases have headache and the others exhibit influenza virus causing abdominal symptoms (Beau De Rochars et al., 2017). Therefore, HCoV-NL63 is the notable pathogen as the etiology of mild and severe respiratory diseases, even acute undifferentiated febrile illness.",

Sambucus FormosanaNakai is a traditional medicinal herb in Taiwan for reducing inflammation, enhancing circulation, and treating rheumatoid and low back pain, neuritis, dermatitis, and infection diseases (Yang and Chiu, 1998). The chemical components of S.ambucus FormosanaNakai include sambuculin A, oleanolic acid, \u03b1-amyrin and \u03b2-amyrin, \u03b2-sitosterol, ursolic acid, pomolic acid, lupeol palmitate, glycyrrhetic acid, phenolic acid constituents, and flavonoids (Chen et al., 2001, 2019; Liao et al., 2006; Lin and Tome, 1988; Yang and Lin, 2004; Zhang et al., 2010). In addition, phenolic acid constituents of S.ambucus FormosanaNakai, including caffeic acid, caffeotannic acid, chlorogenic acid, coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and gallic acid, have been identified as the members of the most important active components with anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor and anti-hepatotoxic activities (Chen et al., 2001; Liao et al., 2006; Yang and Lin, 2004; Zhang et al., 2010). Active components of Sambucus FormosanaNakai are similar to those of other Sambucus species, including Sambucus nigra L. and Sambucus lanceolata, which process antioxidant, antiradical, antiviral, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory activities (Barak et al., 2001; Krawitz et al., 2011; Mandrone et al., 2014; Pinto et al., 2017; Pliszka, 2017; Porter and Bode, 2017; Turek and Cisowski, 2007). Especially, the extract of Sambucus nigra L. exerts the antiviral activity against influenza A and B viruses, human immunodeficiency virus, and the herpes simplex virus type 1 (Krawitz et al., 2011; Serkedjieva et al., 1990; Zakay-Rones et al., 1995; Amoros et al., 1992; Mahmood et al., 1993; Roschek et al., 2009). Sambucus nigraphenolic acids like caffeic acid show the highly inhibitory effect on the in vitro replication of influenza A virus (Porter and Bode, 2017; Utsunomiya et al., 2014). Since Sambucus FormosanaNakai contains such antiviral active components in the extract of Sambucus nigra L., the antiviral activity of Sambucus FormosanaNakai is worthy to further investigate.",

Subsequently, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and gallic acid represented the key phenolic acid constituents in the ethanol stem extract of Sambucus FormosanaNakai, as further assessed the cytotoxicity to LLC-MK2 cells and the antiviral activity against HCoV-NL63 (Supplemental Figs. 2 and 4). The markers of phenolic acid constituents in Sambucus Formosana Nakai extract were less cytotoxic to LLC-MK2 cells, in which CC50 values of caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and gallic acid were greater than 500 \u03bcM (Supplemental Fig. 2, Table 1). In the inhibitory assay of HCoV-NL63 induced cytopathic effect, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and gallic acid, but not coumaric acid and ferulic acid, diminished the cytopathicity in the infected cells (Fig. 4\nA). The antiviral activity of the phenolic acid constituents in the in vitro production of HCoV-NL63 was ranked in the following order of virus yield reduction: caffeic acid (IC50 = 3.54 \u03bcM) > chlorogenic acid (IC50 = 43.45 \u03bcM) > coumaric acid (IC50 = 71.48 \u03bcM) (Fig. 4B, Table 1). The results verified that the phenolic acid constituents, like caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and gallic acid exhibited the prominent antiviral activity against HCoV-NL63, as potential anti-HCoV-NL63 components in the Sambucus FormosanaNakai extract.",

In addition, infectivity inhibition assay with human airway epithelia Calu-3 cells was performed when HCoV-NL63-infected cells with a MOI of 0.05 were treated with 10 and 50 \u03bcM caffeic acid after a 36-h incubation at 32 \u00b0C. Microscopic photography indicated that swelling and rounding were observed in HCoV-NL63-infected Calu-3 cells (Fig. 6\nA, top), as described in the previous study (Lednicky et al., 2013). Caffeic acid at 10 and 50 \u03bcM significantly lessening viral CPE (Fig. 6A, top). Immunofluorescent staining demonstrated that caffeic acid concentration-dependently reduced HCoV-NL63 infectivity determined according to the ratio of HCoV-NL63-positive cells to total cells stained with DAPI (Fig. 6A, middle and bottom). The inhibitory assay with immunofluorescent staining on HCoV-NL63 infectivity indicated that caffeic acid had a potent antiviral activity against the replication of HCoV-NL63 in Calu-3 cells (IC50 = 0.2 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM) (Fig. 6B). The results revealed that caffeic acid displayed the potent anti-HCoV-NL63 activity in a cell-type independent manner, specifically inhibiting on the attachment stage of HCoV-NL63 replication.",

Moreover, Sambucus FormosanaNakai extract showed the potent antiviral activity against HCoV-NL63 with the IC50 values in low microg/ml ranges, such IC50 of 1.17 \u03bcg/ml for virus yield, IC50 of 4.67 \u03bcg/ml for plaque formation, and IC50 of 15.75 \u03bcg/ml for virus attachment. The results were consistent with the previous reports in that Sambucus spp., such Sambucus nigra L. served the antiviral properties against influenza A and B viruses, and the herpes simplex virus type1 (Krawitz et al., 2011; Serkedjieva et al., 1990; Zakay-Rones et al., 1995). In addition, Sambucus juice was the key recipe for the \"Virus Blocking Factor\" that processed the in-vitro antiviral activity against many respiratory viral infections, including influenza A H1N1, rhinovirus B subtype 14, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenzavirus subtype 3, and adenovirus C subtype 5 (Fal et al., 2016). Sambucus nigra L. has been recognized as was a potentially safer alternative to treat upper respiratory symptoms, such common cold and influenza (Hawkins et al., 2019). Thus, Sambucus FormosanaNakai might be the alternative medicinal herb for caring the respiratory viral infections, especially coronavirus-associated common cold.",

            "text": "Caffeic acid has been reported to process the antiviral activity against hepatitis B and C viruses, influenza A virus, and herpes simplex virus (Wang et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2018; Tanida et al., 2015; Utsunomiya et al., 2014; Ikeda et al., 2011; Langland et al., 2018). Caffeic acid reduced the production of hepatitis C virus in vitro via the initial stage of viral replication (Tanida et al., 2015). The antiviral mechanism of caffeic acid against hepatitis C virus was also associated with the activation of p62-mediated Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathway for the HO-1-dependent production of interferon \u03b1, which significantly suppressed the replication of hepatitis C virus (Shen et al., 2018). Caffeic acid markedly decreased the virus yield and cytopathic effect in influenza A virus-infected cells, particular during the period within 3 h post-infection, suggesting that caffeic acid works at the early stages of influenza A virus infection (Utsunomiya et al., 2014). In addition, caffeic acid had no virucidal effect, but significantly affected the production of progeny herpes simplex virus and the binding attachment to the heparan sulfate proteoglycans on cell surface (Ikeda et al., 2011; Langland et al., 2018). Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 has been demonstrated to utilize the heparan sulfate proteoglycans as the co-receptor for attachment to target cells (Milewska et al., 2014). Caffeic acid has also been identified to exhibit a high inhibitory effect on the enzymatic activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) (Chiou et al., 2017); docking studies revealed that caffeic acid also presented the good docking score with the hydrogen bond interactions with the residues in the activity site of ACE2 (Zozimus Divya Lobo et al., 2017). Thus, the inhibitory mechanism of caffeic acid on HCoV-NL63 attachment and infection to cells might be due to that caffeic acid directly target and interfere the binding interaction of HCoV-NL63 with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (co-receptor) and ACE2 (receptor) on cell surface.",

Chlorogenic acid specifically inhibited the neuraminidase activity of influenza A viruses H1N1 and H3N2 that was the crucial mechanism of chlorogenic acid for blocking the release of progeny virions from infected cells (Ding et al., 2017). Gallic acid served the antioxidant capacity that linked with down-regulating the genomic RNA and proteins expression of hepatitis C virus (Govea-Salas et al., 2016). Therefore, the phenolic acid constituents of Sambucus Formosana Nakai extract, like caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid and gallic acid, play the key antiviral components against HCoV-NL63 and the other viruses.",
