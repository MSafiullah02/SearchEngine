            "text": "The flagellated protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis is an obligate human genitourinary parasite and the most frequent cause of sexually transmitted disease worldwide. Most clinical isolates of T. vaginalis are persistently infected with one or more double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses from the genus Trichomonasvirus, family Totiviridae, which appear to influence not only protozoan biology but also human disease. Here we describe the three-dimensional structure of Trichomonas vaginalis virus 1 (TVV1) virions, as determined by electron cryomicroscopy and icosahedral image reconstruction. The structure reveals a T \u202b\u060d\u202c 1 capsid comprising 120 subunits, 60 in each of two nonequivalent positions, designated A and B, as previously observed for fungal Totiviridae family members. The putative protomer is identified as an asymmetric AB dimer consistent with either decamer or tetramer assembly intermediates. The capsid surface is notable for raised plateaus around the icosahedral 5-fold axes, with canyons connecting the 2-and 3-fold axes. Capsid-spanning channels at the 5-fold axes are unusually wide and may facilitate release of the viral genome, promoting dsRNA-dependent immunoinflammatory responses, as recently shown upon the exposure of human cervicovaginal epithelial cells to either TVV-infected T. vaginalis or purified TVV1 virions. Despite extensive sequence divergence, conservative features of the capsid reveal a helix-rich fold probably derived from an ancestor shared with fungal Totiviridae family members. Also notable are mass spectrometry results assessing the virion proteins as a complement to structure determination, which suggest that translation of the TVV1 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in fusion with its capsid protein involves \u060a2, and not \u06091, ribosomal frameshifting, an uncommonly found mechanism to date.",

Here we report the first three-dimensional structure of a trichomonasvirus, which is also the first such structure of any protozoan dsRNA virus; show that it has unusually wide channels at the capsid vertices, with potential for releasing the viral genome and promoting dsRNA-dependent responses by human cells; and provide evidence that it uses \u060a2 ribosomal frameshifting, an uncommon mechanism, to translate its RNA polymerase in fusion with its capsid protein.

Previous studies have shown that TVV infection is associated with variable expression of the T. vaginalis major surface antigen P270, which may aid the parasite in evading human adaptive responses (9, 17, 18) . The presence of TVV has also been shown to decrease T. vaginalis growth or viability and to increase cysteine protease levels, either of which might alter pathogenesis in the human host (19) . A few case studies comparing different aspects of trichomoniasis with the presence of TVV in T. vaginalis clinical isolates have noted correlations with patient signs and symptoms, but the case numbers have remained small (5, 13, 20) .",

Specifically, LRV1 in disseminating Leishmania cells induced immunoinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that promoted parasite persistence in infected mice. Recently, we provided similar evidence for TVV in a human disease model (22) . In particular, similarly to LRV1 in the mouse model (21) , we showed that TVV enhances immunoinflammatory responses to T. vaginalis. In human cervicovaginal epithelial cells, the natural host of T. vaginalis, both TVV-infected parasites and purified TVV virions triggered dsRNA-dependent type I interferon responses, as well as a number of proinflammatory mediators and chemokines (22) , implicated in the pathogenesis of human trichomoniasis and its complications (1) .",

            "text": "In light of the apparent role of TVV in exacerbating disease, a more complete understanding of its fundamental characteristics may be useful for improving both diagnostics and therapeutics of T. vaginalis infections. For each TVV species, the genome comprises a single, linear molecule of dsRNA 4.6 to 5.0 kbp long (8, 9, 12, 23, 24) . The plus-strand RNA includes two long open reading frames (ORFs), an upstream one encoding the coat protein (CP) and a partially overlapping downstream one encoding the RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Ribosomal frameshifting is required for RdRp expression as part of a CP/RdRp fusion, which is incorporated in 1 or 2 copies per virion (25) . The CP ranges from 678 to 746 amino acids (aa) (74 to 82 kDa), and the CP/RdRp ranges from 1,429 to 1,481 aa (159 to 165 kDa). Among the strains of a particular TVV species, the range of genome and protein sizes is much smaller (8) . When viewed by negative-stain transmission electron microscopy (TEM), TVV virions are isometric and 350 \u00c5 in diameter (3, 12, 26) . Although the RNA replication cycle remains poorly characterized, it is presumed to be like that of other Totiviridae family members, including conservative transcription by the virion-associated CP/RdRp molecule(s) (27) . Also like most other Totiviridae family members, TVVs lack the inherent means for extracellular transmission and are transmitted instead by direct cell-to-cell means during cytokinesis and perhaps mating (28) .",

Here we describe the 3D structure of TVV1 virions as determined by cryo-TEM and icosahedral image reconstruction. Among findings of special note are unusually large channels at the capsid vertices, which may facilitate release of the viral genome, promoting dsRNA-dependent immunoinflammatory responses, as recently shown for human epithelial cells exposed to either TVV-positive T. vaginalis isolates or purified TVV virions (22) . Via mass spectrometry assessing the virion proteins as a complement to structure determination, we additionally provide evidence that translation of the TVV1 CP/RdRp protein Aliquots were harvested from the growing culture at selected times after it was diluted into fresh medium at time 0 h. The concentration of cells in each aliquot (filled diamonds) was determined immediately after harvesting with an automatic cell counter. A best-fit curve for the data is also shown. The arrow indicates the time when such cultures were either diluted in fresh medium for passage or harvested by centrifugation for purification of virions. (B) Purified virions were disrupted by heating and run in different lanes of an 8% polyacrylamide gel. One lane was stained with Coomassie R-250 (lane 1). Protein molecular mass markers (kDa) were also analyzed, and their positions are shown at the left. The remainder of the gel was blotted to a membrane and probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies that were raised against portions of the CP or RdRp region after expression in Escherichia coli. Antibody-bound CP (lane 2) and CP/RdRp (lane 3) bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. (C) Nondenaturing gel of the TVV genome. Nucleic acid contents of purified virions were extracted by phenolchloroform-isoamyl alcohol and run in one lane of a 0.7% agarose gel (lane 2).

T. vaginalis UH9 was serially passaged in liquid batch culture so that it ended exponential growth~24 h after the preceding passage (Fig. 1A) . On harvest day, cell pellets were sonicated to release virions, centrifuged to deplete debris, and then sedimented through a CsCl gradient. The gradient was fractionated, and fractions containing virions were identified by electrophoresis. Virions consistently concentrated in only one or two consecutive fractions, corresponding to a visible band in the gradient.

Both \u03e91 and \u03ea2 ribosomal frameshifts have been demonstrated in other organisms (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) , though neither as commonly as a \u03ea1 frameshift (35, 36) . Tandem mass spectrometry to confirm the identity of the CP/RdRp band from purified TVV1-UH9 virions allowed us to begin to address the frameshifting mechanism by identifying the tryptic peptide that spans the CP/RdRp junction. The identified peptide, VGSLFLSK ( Fig. 2A ; see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material), is consistent with \u03ea2, and not \u03e91, frameshifting (Fig. 2B) , and alternative peptides consistent with \u03e91 frameshifting were not found. Thus, TVV1-UH9 appears to translate its CP/RdRp fusion product via \u03ea2 ribosomal frameshifting.",

With longer storage at 4\u00b0C, or after even brief storage at \u03ea20\u00b0C, however, the incidence of clumped, broken, and empty particles increased, suggesting that purified TVV1 virions are relatively unstable. is underlined and is consistent with a \u03ea2, and not a \u03e91, frameshifting mechanism.

All nucleotides are black, except for the stop codon defining the upstream end of the RdRp ORF (frame \u03ea2), which is blue, and the stop codon defining the downstream end of the CP ORF (frame 0), which is red. The putative slippery sequence is underlined. Frame 0 coding of CP is shown at the top. CP codons are overlined in red, and the encoded amino acid residues are shown in red type. Frame 0/\u03ea2 coding of CP/RdRp is shown at the bottom. CP codons are underlined in red, and the encoded amino acid residues are shown in red type; RdRp codons are underlined in blue, and the encoded amino acid residues are shown in blue type. Frameshift is labeled \u03ea2. Sites of trypsin cleavage of CP/RdRp to generate the identified junctional peptide are shown by green carets.

            "text": "Density projection images representing thin planar sections through the 3D map provide edge-on views of the capsid and reveal an inner surface smoother than the outer ( Fig. 4A is an equatorial section of this type). Thinner regions of the capsid are visible near the I2 and I3 axes, reflecting the surface canyons, and thicker regions are visible near the I5 axes, reflecting the plateaus. Throughout these different regions are both punctate and elongated features (Fig. 4A ) representing secondary-structure elements. Of particular note in the equatorial section are open channels at the I5 axes,~20 \u00c5 wide, that span the full capsid thickness and appear larger than comparable ones found in other dsRNA viruses. The I5 channels are also visible in surface views (Fig. 4B ) and in density projection images representing thin radial sections through the map (Fig. 4C ). In surface views directly down an I5 axis, the channels are especially evident and appear wider than those in the genus Totivirus prototype Saccharomyces cerevisiae virus L-A (ScV-L-A) (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). Our conservative estimates of the I5 channel width in the current TVV1 structure (see Materials and Methods) are 16 \u00c5 near the bottom of the channel and 24 \u00c5 near the top of the channel, versus 14 \u00c5 for the channels in the resolution-matched structure of ScV-L-A (see Fig. S2 ; reported as 18 \u00c5 in the 3.3-\u00c5 ScV-L-A crystal structure [40] ). Thus, even in TVV1, these channels are probably not directly large enough to allow escape of the dsRNA genome (26-\u00c5 diameter) or entry of most types of cellular proteins that might damage the genome (e.g., RNases). Secondary-structure elements, noted in Fig. 4A , are also seen in the radial sections, some dramatically so, such as two apparent \u2423-helices that have Less-well-resolved densities in central regions of the equatorial section ( Fig. 4A ) are likely to represent the dsRNA genome. These densities take the form of two or three concentric rings, the outer one best resolved and each separated by~30 \u00c5 ( Fig. 5A and B) . These rings are consistent with close packing of dsRNA helices into locally parallel arrays that are evenly distributed, on average, through open space in the particle interior. A similar arrangement has been described for other dsRNA viruses (42) (43) (44) and was first shown for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) bacteriophages (45) . The closest approaches between the capsid and outer RNA ring appear to occur near and flanking the I2 axes. Such contacts are likely important for determining the position of the outer ring and might also play roles in RNA packaging or transcription. In this regard, it is notable that the outer ring, in particular, has a hexagonal appearance in Fig. 4A , suggesting that it follows the capsid symmetry and is likely influenced by direct interactions with the capsid undersurface. Thickening of the outer-ring densities under the capsid I5 axes might reflect the presence of the RdRp domain hanging into the particle interior near those positions and representing the 1 or 2 CP/RdRp molecules thought to be present in each virion. The RdRp-associated densities in TVV1 are expected to be much weaker than those observed in Reoviridae family members (46, 47) , which have 9 to 12 RdRp molecules packaged per virion.",

Limited or transient exposure of the dsRNA through such expanded channels might also occur in intact virions, but only to an extent that maintains its resistance to RNase III cleavage (39), as we have recently reported for TVV1-UH9 virions (22) .",

Ovoid elements surrounding the I5 axes in surface views of the capsid (Fig. 4B ) appear to represent 120 CP subunits of two types, A and B. To assign specific features in more detail, we used an ab initio approach to segment out the densities attributable to each subunit in the 3D map (see Materials and Methods). Importantly, secondary-structure elements similar in shape and placement were observed as repeating units in both A and B, allowing us to distinguish those subunits. Using this approach, we produced a complete \"T \u03ed 2\" model that accounted for all of the capsid densities in the reconstruction (Fig. 6A) . As seen for other Totiviridae family members (38) (39) (40) (41) , the A and B subunits in TVV1 appear to have similar overall density envelopes despite different local environments (Fig. 6A) . Each displays an elongated, comma-like shape with the thickened end distal to the I5 axis. A subunits approach and surround each I5 axis, excluding B subunits, and B subunits approach and surround each I3 axis, excluding A subunits (Fig. 6A ). In addition, A subunits from two different pentamers approach each other across each I2 axis, appearing to exclude B subunits from that axis as well.",

            "text": "Having assigned specific densities to A and B subunits, we found it instructive to examine them in pairs, since an AB dimer may be the protomer for capsid assembly. For any A subunit in the TVV1 capsid, there are three contacting B subunits, each with a distinct A-B interface. Two of the resulting dimers are asymmetric, whereas the third is quasisymmetric (respectively labeled AB 1 , AB 2 , and AB 3 in Fig. 6A ). In other Totiviridae family members, as well as in larger dsRNA viruses from the family Reoviridae, one or the other asymmetric AB dimer has been picked to represent the IAU of the capsid (38, 39, 41, 48) . The rationale for this choice has been the greater buried surface area, or compactness, in either asymmetric dimer than that of the quasisymmetric one. Another reason is that an assembly model has developed for Reoviridae family members in which a compact (AB) 5 decamer is a suggested intermediate (Fig. 6B) , 12 of which are thought to combine to form the inner capsid (48) (49) (50) . Applying that model to TVV1, the putative AB protomer would be one of the asymmetric dimers (AB 1 or AB 2 in Fig. 6A) ; it could not be the quasisymmetric one (AB 3 ) because the subunits in that dimer belong to two different compact decamers in the capsid (Fig. 6B ). Another possibility, however, is that the putative decamer is less compact, comprising five A subunits interacting around the I5 axis and five quasisymmetrically placed B subunits hanging off as arms (Fig. 6C) . Thus, a quasisymmetric AB protomer is also consistent with a decamer intermediate, albeit an unlikely one that is distinct from that previously suggested for Reoviridae family members (48) (49) (50) . Interestingly, recent demonstrations of domain swapping within the quasisymmetric AB dimer of smaller dsRNA viruses from the families Partitiviridae and Picobirnaviridae (44, 51, 52) identify it as the more likely protomer of those viruses. Moreover, in those smaller viruses, as well as in larger viruses of the family Cystoviridae (53) , an (AB) 2 tetramer intermediate is suspected or known to occur (44, (51) (52) (53) , inconsistent with either type of decamer intermediate because subunits in the implicated tetramer belong to two different decamers in the capsid (Fig. 6D) .",

The CPs of many Totiviridae family members seem to share a helical core (41) . We therefore compared the 3D locations of putative helices in the TVV1 map to known helices in the ScV-L-A atomic model (40) . Most of the helices in TVV1 do not strongly overlap ones in ScV-L-A, though several appear to have been only rotated or translated to nearby locations (Fig. 7B) . Moreover, when we superimposed the segmented densities of one subunit each from TVV1 and HvV190S (41), we found that two putative, long \"core\" helices of the two CPs overlap quite well. It thus seems reasonable to conclude that the CPs of both fungal and protozoan Totiviridae family members have in common a helix-rich fold probably derived from an ancient common ancestor. Despite similar density envelopes and apparently similar helix-rich folds, however, identity scores in pairwise alignments of TVV1-UH9, ScV-L-A, and HvV190S CPs are quite low, \u03fd18% in each case (determined using EMBOSS Stretcher with default settings at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools /psa/).

It may also mean that they need not be as stable as many extracellularly transmitting viruses are, since they have no regular need to survive in varied environments outside cells. Some viruses with this transmission strategy have evolved to lack capsids, such as members of the family Hypoviridae (57), but others possess capsids, including TVV1 and members of several other dsRNA virus families. In these viruses, the capsid is essential in part because of their RNA replication strategy, which involves a capsid-associated RdRp and also in part because the capsid sequesters the genome and thereby reduces host sensing of dsRNA for associated responses in many hosts. The capsids of these vi-ruses may also have other functions, such as in intracellular localization to promote partitioning into both daughter cells during cytokinesis or into the partner cell during mating. Nonetheless, their capsids have had no need to evolve functions for entering cells from the outside, such as cell surface receptor binding and membrane penetration. Thus, the complex surface topography of the TVV1 virion seen in this study is almost certainly unrelated to any functions for entering T. vaginalis cells from the extracellular environment.",

An important reason for wishing to have a more complete understanding of protozoan viruses includes recent evidence that both LRV1 and TVVs determine important mammalian responses to the respective protozoan infections, in a mouse model for LRV1 and a human cell model for TVVs (21, 22) . In fact, for TVVs, our recent results with the antiprotozoan drug metronidazole suggest that virions escaping from damaged or dying T. vaginalis cells might be sensed by human epithelial cells, leading to the upregulation of immunoinflammatory cytokines and chemokines via dsRNA-dependent signaling pathways and exacerbation of disease symptoms (22) . This and other evidence of the role of virions provided special incentive for the present study to determine the 3D structure of TVV1. As described in Results, the newly observed, wide I5 channels might contribute to effects on human cells by facilitating the release of the dsRNA genome, which is then sensed by the human cells endosomally (22) . On the basis of the behavior of T. vaginalis isolate UH9 and purified TVV1-UH9 virions in inducing immunoinflammatory signaling (22) , we conclude that TVV1 is sufficient for these effects on human epithelial cells, but we do not yet know if it is necessary. Perhaps TVV2, TVV3, and TVV4 can contribute as well, and perhaps even in distinct manners.",

The RNA structure causes ribosomal pausing, which stimulates the ribosome to slide back one base at the end of the slippery sequence and then read ZNN as the next codon. The TVV2, TVV3, and TVV4 strains probably use a related such mechanism to express their CP/RdRp fusions, in that the downstream RdRp ORF overlaps the upstream CP ORF in the \u03ea1 frame and also an RNA \"slippery-like\" sequence (G-GGC-CCC in TVV2, G-GGC-CCU in TVV3 and TVV4) is conserved within this overlap (8, 10) .",

The overlap between the CP and RdRp ORFs in TVV1 strains is short, only 14 nucleotides between flanking stop codons (Fig. 2B) , restricting the necessary frameshift to this small region that includes the putative slippery motif. Shifting of translation to the \u03e91 frame can occur by a single, either \u03e91 or \u03ea2, ribosomal frameshifting event, though until recently, \u03ea2 frameshifting had been shown to be used naturally by only one organism, dsDNA bacteriophage Mu (31) , to express a C-terminally extended form of one of its tail assembly proteins, and to occur after genetic manipulations of two others, HIV-1 and budding yeast (32, 33) . Recently, though, \u03ea2 frameshifting has been shown to be used naturally by mammalian arteriviruses, plus-stranded RNA viruses related to coronaviruses and including the important swine pathogen porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, to express a C-terminally extended form of one of their nonstructural proteins (34) . The authors of the arterivirus report have further predicted, on the basis of sequence features, that \u03ea2 frameshifting is likely also to be used by TVV1 (34, 36) . The demonstration here that the junctional peptide of TVV1-UH9 CP/RdRp is consistent with \u03ea2, and not \u03e91, frameshifting agrees with that prediction. In the arteriviruses, the \u03ea2 slippery motif has been identified as G-GUU-UUU, at the end of which the ribosome slides back two bases, reading UUN as the next codon, which is in line with the \u03ea2 slippery motif of TVV1, C-CUU-UUU (Fig. 2B) . Since it is an uncommonly found mechanism to date, perhaps \u03ea2 frameshifting by TVV1 could be a target for novel antiviral compounds that would clear T. vaginalis cells of TVV1 without damaging the protozoan and thereby leading to enhanced immunoinflammatory signaling by human epithelial cells, as metronidazole has been shown to do (22) .",

In every sequencecharacterized TVV1 strain to date, a \u03ea1 frameshift on this slippery sequence would lead the ribosome to immediately encounter a conserved stop codon, UGA (8, 10) . Thus, a \u03ea1 frameshift would yield an alternative version of CP that is a single Glu residue shorter than the nonframeshifted product (Fig. 2C) . Given its possible significance, we have attempted to demonstrate this second form of CP, but so far with no success.",

Micrographs exhibiting minimal astigmatism and specimen drift were selected for processing and were digitized at 6.35-m intervals (representing 1.09-\u00c5 pixels at the specimen) on a Nikon Supercoolscan 8000 microdensitometer. The program RobEM (http://cryoEM.ucsd.edu/programs.shtm) was used to estimate defocus and astigmatism, extract particle images, and preprocess the images as previously described (58) . For each specimen, 150 particle images were used as the input for random-model computation to generate an initial 3D density map at an~25-\u00c5 resolution (59) . This map was then used to determine and refine particle orientations and origins for the complete set of images with AUTO3DEM v4.02 (60). Phases but not amplitudes of the structure factor data were corrected for effects caused by the microscope contrast transfer function (46, 61) . After calculation of the FSC between two reconstructions generated from half data sets, FSC \u03ed 0.5 \u03ea 0.143 threshold criteria were used to estimate the resolution limit of each full data set (37) . Before the calculation, a soft mask was applied to the two reconstructions to suppress most of the solvent. To generate the soft mask, the programs bfilter, bmask, and bsegment from Bsoft (http: //lsbr.niams.nih.gov/bsoft/) were used. The original map was low-pass filtered to 15 \u00c5 (bfilter), and a binary mask was obtained by applying a threshold that visually included all of the densities in the shell (bmask). To eliminate contributions from the genome in virions, the mask was segmented into separate regions (bsegment), and only the shell region was retained (bmask). Finally, the binary mask was transformed into a soft mask by applying three iterations of an average filter with kernel size 3 (bfilter). For the virion map, an additional resolution estimate was performed, which analyzed the reconstruction in a localized manner, calculating the FSC around voxels of interest (blocres).",

The reconstructions were rendered at an isodensity contour level of 1.2 for space-filling views of the TVV1 surface (Fig. 4B, 6 , and 7C; see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). The width of the I5 channel was measured in Chimera while using a spherical marker for guidance. To assess the accuracy of the estimate, we repeated the measurement while changing the contour level between 1.0 and 1.5 , corresponding to a variation in capsid volume of~20%. As a result, the channel width varied by \u03fd10%. Map segmentation was performed with the Segger tool (63) in Chimera as previously described (41) . Briefly, the segmentation obtained with this tool does not rely on an initial model and was refined in a semiautomatic manner by imposing additional restrictions. Specifically, these restrictions ensured that global morphology and specific features were repeated in the A and B subunits, that the symmetry constraints of the icosahedral arrangement of subunits within the capsid were maintained, and that no obvious capsid density was left unassigned.",
