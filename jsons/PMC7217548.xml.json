            "text": "The study of spreading phenomena on networks has received considerable attention in many disciplines, including sociology, economics, physics, biology, computer science, mathematics, and others [1\u201318]. In analogy with the spread of infectious diseases in populations of susceptible individuals, the spread of social phenomena (such as opinions, actions, memes, information, misinformation, and alternative facts) is often viewed as a contagion process that spreads through a network's nodes, which are connected to each other via one or more types of edges. The nodes can represent entities such as people or institutions [19\u201321] (or other things); and the edges can represent physical proximity, communication channels, sociological interactions (e.g., different types of relationships), or something else. An important goal of many studies of the spread of social contagions is the identification of criteria that determine when the phenomenon that is spreading reaches a large fraction of a population or subpopulation [1,2].",

            "text": "Scholars have used various approaches for studying contagions on networks. These include game theory [7], statistical physics [10], agent-based models [22], and systems of coupled differential equations or stochastic processes [2,23\u201327]. The temporal dynamics and peak size of an outbreak are influenced both by the specific model of a contagion and by the structure of the network on which it spreads [12,20,25,27\u201334]. A key idea is to examine when a disease or idea\u2014perhaps one that initially is present in a small fraction of nodes\u2014can become widespread in a network. When a large fraction of a population or subpopulation becomes infected (or adopts an idea), one says that a cascade has occurred. Cascading phenomena have been studied in a wide variety of systems, ranging from financial networks [21] to social media like Twitter [35]. For example, a failing financial institution can cause a cascade of failures of numerous other financial institutions, a tweet can result in a cascade of tweets that promotes the opinion of the original tweeter (perhaps influenced by the actions of \u201cbot\u201d or sockpuppet accounts [17]), and widely spread alternative facts can influence the opinions of a large population of voters [36]. Notwithstanding these dystopian examples, cascading behavior can be beneficial, neutral, or harmful.",

One example of models that traditionally have deterministic update rules is threshold models for social contagions. The simplest example is the Watts threshold model (WTM) [5,6,9], a type of bootstrap percolation [37], in which each node is assigned a threshold from some distribution. When considering a node for updating, if the fraction of its neighbors that are adopters is at least as large as its threshold, it too becomes an adopter. There are numerous variants and generalizations of the WTM, including ones with adoption thresholds that are based on the number (rather than the fraction) of neighbors who are adopters [12,38], ones with multiple adoption stages [25], ones with \u201csynergy\u201d from other nearby adopters [27], and ones with timers in addition to adoption thresholds [39].",

Rogers [40] gave a qualitative description (as a sigmoidal shape) of the number of adopters as a function of time. Bass [41] developed a model for the adoption of innovations that was inspired by models for biological contagions. Bass's model results in sigmoidal-shaped adoption curves, and it has been generalized in various ways [42\u201345]. More recent studies have considered models in which agents of different types can have significant effects on the final distributions of products or innovations in a population. For example, Gordon et al.\n[46] showed that temporal cycles of adoption can occur if some nodes are allowed to regret adopting an innovation while other (\u201ccontrarian\u201d) nodes resist adopting innovations. References [47,48] found rich behavior (including chaotic dynamics) in a social contagion model that incorporates an aversion to complete conformity.",

            "text": "Contrarian agents, a key aspect of the present paper, have been incorporated into various types of models of opinion dynamics and hierarchy formation. In the 1980s, Galam [49] illustrated a hierarchical mechanism that allows a minority community to elect its preferred candidate instead of that of the majority. Galam and collaborators have also examined the effects of contrarian [50] and stubborn [51,52] agents on opinion dynamics (though typically without any network structure). Nyczka et al.\n[53] and Nyczka and Sznajd-Weron [54] studied various opinion models (e.g., q-voter models) on a complete graph to highlight an important distinction between two types of nonconformity\u2014anticonformity and independence\u2014that have distinct implications for social dynamics. Khalil and Toral [55] incorporated contrarians into a noisy voter model, and they illustrated that a few contrarians can substantially alter the dynamics of the model. Apriasz et al.\n[56] examined an opinion model that includes \u201csnobs,\u201d who conform to nodes in their own community but anticonform to nodes in others, to examine how the density of connections between two communities can affect phenomena such as fashion cycles. One can also consider contrarian individuals in the context of economic markets, such as in work by Sznajd-Weron and Weron [57], who studied an Ising model on a rectangular lattice to model advertising in duopoly markets. More recent work related to contrarian agents, in addition to [46\u201348], includes that of Mellor et al.\n[58], who examined a population in which nodes can either adopt a product or become \u201cluddites,\u201d who oppose the spread of innovation. They found that luddites greatly limit adoption if the adoption rate is high but not if it is low. Gambaro and Crokidakis [59] illustrated that contrarian agents can be a source of disorder in opinion dynamics, and Ferrara and collaborators have investigated how individual social-media accounts controlled by bots can exert a considerable influence on political elections and social cascades [17,60,61].",

In a recent example about information spreading, Petersen et al.\n[64] provided psychological assessment of motivations to share hostile political rumors (e.g., in the form of \u201cfake news\u201d) among citizens of democratic societies, concluding that such rumors are often shared by individuals because they believe it can mobilize their audience against a disliked establishment (rather than because they think that these rumors are true).",

In some cases, such as the 2016 \u201cBrexit\u201d vote [65] and the 2016 American presidential election [66], antiestablishment opinions appear to have spread to so many people that they exerted a major influence on political outcomes. In this paper, we ask the following questions: (1) How does a large fraction of a population decide to choose something different from the established standard? (2) How can a small fraction of individuals spread their antiestablishment opinions to a majority (or at least to a very large minority) of the rest of a population? (3) Can we capture these ideas using a simple mathematical model of a spreading process on a network?",

This study observed that the dynamics of a population was influenced greatly by delays in the knowledge of hipsters and by how large a fraction of the population are hipsters. In the model in [67], individuals interact with their environments and switch between two states with a probability that depends on this environment and on whether an individual is a conformist (preferring to be aligned with its environment) or a hipster (preferring to be opposite to its environment). The model has a phase transition that determines whether or not hipsters ultimately attain the same state. Touboul [67] referred to the anticonformists with delayed knowledge as \u201chipsters.\u201d Because the model that we introduce in this study includes anticonformists with delayed knowledge of the global product distribution, we adopt this terminology.

Conformists prefer to adopt the product (or meme, opinion, message, etc.) that is more popular among their active neighbors at time t\u22121. Hipsters, however, prefer to adopt the product that is the less popular of the two products in the whole network at some previous time t\u2212\u03c4. Their choice to adopt a product uses the same adoption condition as that of the conformists. This is a strong assumption, and we make it partly for simplicity (as it allows us to build from the WTM) and partly because it reflects a scenario in which an anticonformist may more actively rebel on an issue that is sufficiently established in its neighborhood in a network. In our model, both conformists and hipsters first choose to buy some product or form an opinion, and then they choose which one to adopt. In their study of the effect of luddites, Mellor et al.\n[58] assumed that the probability of a node becoming a luddite is proportional to the rate of change in the density of adopters of its neighbors. This resembles our choice that a node's neighborhood influences whether or not it elects to adopt a product, but it differs from our choice that each of our nodes is either inherently a conformist or inherently a hipster. The delay \u03c4 in our model encodes the fact that knowledge about the total population is not instantly available; instead, it is collected over some time before it is available. See Gleeson et al.\n[68] for a model (without network structure) that illustrates another type of competition between local information (in the form of a social-media feed) and global information (in the form of a bestseller list).",

An active node has adopted a product (or meme, opinion, etc.) that is spreading in a population, and an inactive node has not adopted the product. (We will use the term \u201cproduct\u201d from now on.) Once a node becomes active, it stays active forever. The threshold of a node determines how difficult it is to activate that node, so one can construe a node's threshold value as its stubbornness level.

Each node can adopt only a single product, and once it has adopted a product, it never switches to the other product or becomes inactive. To keep track of the product distribution, we associate a variable Si with each node i. If Si=0, node i is inactive; if Si=1, node i has adopted product A; and if Si=2, node i has adopted product B.

This is also appropriate for exploring the competition between local and global forms of influence. We examine our hipster model both on synthetic networks and on empirical social networks.

In this more general case, it is also necessary to take the sums over \u03b2 over a larger set of products (and to replace the step function in the product with a more complicated function). We write q\u00afk(\u03d5,k)(t) as a function of qi(\u03d5\u2032,k\u2032)(t), the probability that, for a given inactive node, a neighbor with degree k\u2032 and threshold \u03d5\u2032 is active at time step t. This probability is given by\n(3)q\u00af\u03bb(\u03d5,k)(t)=\u2211k\u2032,\u03d5\u2032P((k,\u03d5),(k\u2032,\u03d5\u2032))q\u03bb\u03d5\u2032,k(t)\u2211k\u2032,\u03d5\u2032P((k,\u03d5),(k\u2032,\u03d5\u2032)),where P((k,\u03d5),(k\u2032,\u03d5\u2032)) is the probability that a node with degree k and threshold \u03d5 is adjacent to a node with degree k\u2032 and threshold \u03d5\u2032. Given an active node, the probability that a particular neighbor with degree k and threshold \u03d5 is active is\n(4)q\u03bb(\u03d5,k)(t+1)=\u03c1\u03bb(\u03d5,k)(t)+1\u2212\u03c1\u03bb(\u03d5,k)(t)\u2211k\u2032=1k\u22121F(k,k\u2032,\u03d5)Bk\u2032k\u2211\u03b2\u2208{A,B}q\u00af\u03b2(\u03d5,k)(t)\u00d7\u2211k,\u03d5\u03c1\u03bb(\u03d5,k)(max{t\u2212\u03c4,0})\u2212\u2211k,\u03d5\u03c1\u03b2(\u03d5,k)(max{t\u2212\u03c4,0})(1\u2212pHip)\u2211k\u2032\u2032=1k\u2032\u0398k\u2032\u2032\u2212k\u20322Bk\u2032\u2032k\u2032q\u00af\u03bb(\u03d5,k)(t)\u2211\u03b2\u2208{A,B}q\u00af\u03b2(\u03d5,k)(t)+pHip\u220f\u03b2\u2260\u03bb\u0398\u2211k,\u03d5\u03c1\u03bb(\u03d5,k)(max{t\u2212\u03c4,0})\u2212\u2211k,\u03d5\u03c1\u03b2(\u03d5,k)(max{t\u2212\u03c4,0}).The only difference between Eq. (4) and Eq. (1) stems from the following: in Eq. (1), we consider any degree-k node; however, in Eq. (4), we consider a degree-k neighbor of an inactive node. The latter has a maximum of k\u22121 active neighbors, which is therefore the maximum value of the index of the first sum in Eq. (4). In these equations, we have assumed that each neighbor of node i is independent of the others, so we are assuming that this process is occurring on a locally treelike network [2,71]. However, the Facebook network that we used in Sec. III has a large local clustering coefficient [69], so it is not locally treelike.",

For larger values of pHip, our analytical approximation has jumps in the fraction that adopt each product; we again do not observe this phenomenon in our simulations. One possibility, which we suggested in our discussion of 3-regular configuration-model networks in Sec. V B, is whether our analytical approximation is running into problems because we are considering networks that are not locally treelike (although similar approximations are known to be effective for many networks that are not locally treelike [71]). Additionally, note that the mean local clustering coefficient for our ER networks with z=5 is 0.00058\u00b10.00018, so our networks have very few 3-cycles. If we ignore which product is adopted and pretend that the two products are the same, we recover the usual WTM model; the present paper uses an analytical approximation that is known to work in that situation [31]. Our own recent work has demonstrated that this type of analytical approximation is also effective for a WTM augmented with \u201csynergistic\u201d social influence from nodes other than nearest neighbors [27], so the incorporation of different types of nodes (rather than the lack of a locally treelike network structure) appears to be the likely cause of the breakdown of the approximation, especially given that our approximation becomes worse as we increase the hipster probability pHip.",

Each node is adjacent to its immediate neighbors, with 2 neighbors each, except for nodes 0 and N\u22121 (which each have degree 1). For the sake of the argument, we assume that all nodes are vulnerable and that there is no delay in information (so that \u03c4=1). We also suppose that node 0 is the only seed, so it has adopted product A at time t=0 [see Fig. 8(a)]. If there are no hipsters in the line, all nodes in this scenario eventually adopt product A. If, by contrast, a single node i is a hipster, then all nodes j\u2265i eventually adopt product B. Therefore, if each node has the same independent probability of being a hipster, the expected steady-state fraction of product-B adopters approaches 1/2 as N\u2192\u221e. In this case, the presence of a single hipster node increases the expected steady-state fraction of nodes that adopt product B from 0 nodes to half of the nodes. The main idea is that early adopters can influence later adopters in a way that depends on the adoption paths that are available [39]. Moreover, although the expected steady-state fraction of product-B adopters is 1/2, a single simulation of the model is equally likely to result in any number of product-B adopters, because each node is equally likely to be the hipster. This may be a reason why we observe large standard deviations in different realizations of our model on the various types of networks. For more complicated network topologies, although it is no longer true in general that different steady-state fractions of product-B adopters are equally probable, the steady-state adoption fraction in a given simulation depends significantly on where hipsters are located in a network.\n",

As in the above example on a line graph, if a certain node is a hipster, it will force the nodes that follow it in an adoption path to adopt product B, rather than product A.

Because level l has nl nodes, a single hipster in level nl causes 1/nl of the nodes in later levels (l\u2032\u2265l+1) to adopt product B.

The above analysis indicates that the fraction of nodes that a single hipster can cause to adopt product B is related to the properties of a dissemination tree. For dissemination trees with a progressively larger number of mean descendants per node, we expect a progressively larger fraction of nodes in an associated network to adopt product B when a single hipster is present in the network. Equation (5) illustrates that, for a given network, increasing the number of hierarchical levels in a dissemination tree tends to result in a larger number of product-B adopters from a single hipster.",

A delay of \u03c4\u22652 postpones this time, at which hipsters start adopting product A rather than product B, so we expect hipsters who adopt product A to have fewer descendants than if \u03c4=1.

If there is no delay (i.e., \u03c4=1) and there are many hipsters, then hipsters tend to balance the popularities of the two products, leading to roughly equal fractions of the two products at steady state (as we saw in our simulations on all networks in Sec.

For example, for either stochastic update rules or asynchronous updating, we expect an increase in the number of steady-state product-B adopters with increasing pHip for small values of pHip, followed by a decrease (or stall) in the number of steady-state product-B adopters when enough hipsters are present in a network (as some of them will now adopt product A). However, the rate at which the steady-state fraction of product-B adopters increases with pHip for small pHip is likely to be influenced by stochastic update rules and asynchronous updating. For instance, suppose that we use the same rules for product selection but that we employ an asynchronous updating process in which, during each time step, we select a node uniformly at random to update; we repeat this selection process some number of times during the same time step; and we then advance time by one step. We then continue with this process in our simulations until no further spreading occurs. In this case, every node in a network can potentially adopt a product even in the first time step, and the process tends to spread at a different rate\u2014it can be either faster or slower\u2014than in synchronous updating. Because the hipsters are distributed uniformly at random and the rules governing product choice are the same as in our original model, changing the number of adopters during each time step can directly affect hipsters, as their product choice is time-dependent. (Other nodes are affected indirectly, as they can experience a different product distribution in their neighborhoods.) Consequently, a faster initial spreading would increase early product-B adoption for a delay \u03c4\u22652, as all hipsters are guaranteed to choose product B for time steps t\u2264\u03c4. To test this, we simulate the spreading of products on 5-regular configuration-model networks with \u03c4=2 and a single product-A adopter as a seed. We use the asynchronous updating procedure that we just described above. Averaging our results over 100 realizations [which we determine as in Fig. 3(b)], we find that the steady-state product-B adoption fraction increases faster as we increase pHip for small values of pHip than what was the case for synchronous updating [see Fig. 3(b)]. As we expected, we also find that the product-B steady-state adoption fraction decreases as we increase pHip for larger values of pHip. More generally, different update mechanisms and update orders can yield different dissemination trees, which describe how a contagion spreads through a network [39]. This can, in turn, impact steady-state product popularities.",

For example, with a threshold distribution in which all nodes are vulnerable, a spreading process can reach a steady state very quickly, and there are then few hierarchical levels in the associated dissemination tree. By contrast, a threshold distribution for which a network starts with fewer vulnerable nodes may take longer to reach a steady state, and one thus expects more levels in an associated dissemination tree. From our analysis, we see that this in turn can increase the steady-state adoption fraction of product B for small values of pHip. Performing simulations on 5-regular configuration model networks with \u03c4=2 [as in Fig. 3(b)] and 150 seed nodes with probabilities p0=1.00,p0=0.90,andp0=0.80 supports this intuition.

To illustrate this point, we again consider line networks and k-regular trees. For a line network with a single hipster and a seed node that adopts product A at one end, the expected steady-state fraction of product-B adopters is roughly 1/2 for a line with any number of nodes. However, adding another level to a k-regular tree with a single seed node that adopts product A affects the expected steady-state fraction of product-B adopters. For example, a 3-regular tree with 3 levels (and hence with 10 nodes in total) has an expected steady-state fraction \u03c1\u00afB=15/100 of product-B adopters, whereas a 3-regular tree with 4 levels (and hence with 22 nodes in total) has \u03c1\u00afB=1/10. This difference occurs because adding another level to the 3-regular tree increases the fraction of nodes that are leaves. Therefore, the randomly distributed hipsters have fewer descendants on average in a dissemination tree, decreasing the expected fraction of product-B adopters at steady state. In simulations on regular configuration-model networks with 103 nodes (using several values of \u03c4 for 3-regular networks and \u03c4=3 for 5-regular ones) for small values of pHip, we observe the same fast increase in steady-state product-B adopters as we increase pHip that we observed previously for these networks with 104 nodes (see, e.g., Fig. 4). However, for large values of pHip, the steady-state product-B adopter fraction can differ substantially in simulations on networks with 103 nodes and 104 nodes. More generally, our analysis demonstrates that the number of nodes in a network can affect steady-state product distributions. Even taking seed-size scaling into consideration (see [70]), dissemination trees can still change, potentially affecting qualitative steady-state results.",

Furthermore, suppose that two competing products are spreading in a k-regular tree in which the central node is the only seed. As usual, the seed has adopted product A. When we constructed our approximation (7) for the steady-state distribution of products in the limit of few hipsters, we assumed that every hipster adopts product B. In the modified hipster model in our current discussion, this approximation may be very bad. Hipsters who descend from other hipsters may adopt product A. We thus expect the product-B steady-state adoption fraction to increase more slowly with pHip for small pHip if a hipster adopts the product that is less popular among its neighbors, rather than the less-popular product among all active nodes in a network.

In the absence of a time delay, we found that hipsters tend to balance the adoption of the two competing products. For all other delay values and all examined types of networks, we observed that the steady-state fraction of nodes that adopt product B (i.e., the product that would not be adopted in the absence of hipsters) grows rapidly with the probability of hipsters. Surprisingly, for all of our networks, we needed only a small probability of hipsters to observe many situations in which product B is comparably popular, or even more popular, than product A at steady state. In our simulations on a variety of synthetic networks, we found that it is often sufficient for fewer than 10% of the nodes to be hipsters for product B to become at least as widespread as product A (the only product that has any adopters at time t=0).

On these networks, we obtained good agreement between simulations and an approximation of the steady-state fraction of nodes that adopt product B in the limit of few hipsters. From our analytical approximation in the few-hipster regime, we observed that the steady-state product-B adoption fraction increases with the distance between the seed node and other nodes. This gives some insight into why there is a much slower increase in product-B adopters for the spreading process on the Facebook network than in the examined synthetic networks, as the former has a smaller mean geodesic (i.e., shortest) path length than our synthetic networks. It also suggests that different realizations with identical parameter values may result in very different steady-state adoption fractions, given that we use random processes to choose hipsters and seed nodes. One consequence of such sensitivity to initial conditions is large standard deviations in the mean steady-state adoption fraction of each product, which is what we observed in most cases. The same mechanistic insight suggests that a larger delay \u03c4 results in more hipsters adopting product B early in a simulation, and each of these early adopters influences the product choice of later adopters. We believe that postponing the time at which hipsters choose product A instead of product B is the main reason that a progressively larger delay \u03c4 results in a progressively larger peak of the expected product-B adoption fraction as a function pHip. Finally, the mechanistic insight from our approximation in the few-hipster limit also helps illustrate that the properties\u2014such as threshold distributions, the number of nodes in a network, and update rules\u2014of an update rule or network that affect dissemination trees (which describe how a contagion spreads through a network) can affect observations at steady state, although some qualitative observations should be robust under such variations.",

The quality of the match between our pair approximation and numerical simulations also depends both on network structure and on the hipster probability.

For all time delays \u03c4\u22652 [see panels (b)\u2013(f)], the maximum steady-state fraction that adopts product B does not take place at pHip values near 0.08; instead, it occurs for much larger values of pHip. We also plot our analytically estimated fractions of product adoption from Eq. (1). Our approximation matches well with our computations for small values of pHip. For pHip\u2a860.06, however, our approximation does not do well. Our analytical solution includes jumps in the steady-state adoption fractions of the products, but these do not arise in our numerical simulations.",
