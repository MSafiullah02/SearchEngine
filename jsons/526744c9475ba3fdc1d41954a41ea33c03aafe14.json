            "text": "Motivated by the current COVID-19 epidemic, this work introduces an epidemiological model in which separate compartments are used for susceptible and asymptomatic \"socially distant\" populations. Distancing directives are represented by rates of flow into these compartments, as well as by a reduction in contacts that lessens disease transmission. The dynamical behavior of this system is analyzed, under various different rate control strategies, and the sensitivity of the basic reproduction number to various parameters is studied. One of the striking features of this model is the existence of a critical implementation delay in issuing separation mandates: while a delay of about four weeks does not have an appreciable effect, issuing mandates after this critical time results in a far greater incidence of infection. In other words, there is a nontrivial but tight \"window of opportunity\" for commencing social distancing. Different relaxation strategies are also simulated, with surprising results. Periodic relaxation policies suggest a schedule which may significantly inhibit peak infective load, but that this schedule is very sensitive to parameter values and the schedule's frequency. Further, we considered the impact of steadily reducing social distancing measures over time. We find that a too-sudden reopening of society may negate the progress achieved under initial distancing guidelines, if not carefully designed. 0 These authors (listed alphabetically) contributed equally.",

A novel aspect of our model lies in the distinction that we make between rate control and the decrease in contacts between infected and susceptible individuals due to distancing. We call this latter reduction in transmission the contact rescaling factor (CoRF). One can interpret the CoRF value as reflecting the effectiveness of social distancing. This number is a function of the stringency of rules (stay at home except for shopping and emergencies, wash hands frequently, wear masks, stay 6 ft. apart, etc.). Some authors consider tuning what we call the CoRF as the control \"knob\" used by authorities, e.g. [12, 13, 14, 15, 16] . Our focus is, instead, on rate control, which has not been sufficiently explored. Indeed, the objective of our model is to make it possible to formally consider rate control. In future work, we will study the combination of rate and CoRF control.",

We rigorously demonstrate, without simulations, that at sufficiently early stages of the pandemic when there is little immunity in the population, no amount of social distancing will result in R 0 < 1. While it is easy to interpret this as a hopeless situation, what this actually says is that an initially headline-grabbing infection will begin to move through the population. However, as time progresses, we show that social distancing can indeed have the desired effect of pushing R 0 to a value less than 1 by accelerating the approach to herd immunity, This conclusion about the impact of social distancing at different stages on the pandemic is dependent on the parameter choices made in the model. As many of these parameters are still uncertain, we also explored how R 0 depends on a combination of a single model parameter and the social distancing parameter. One major unknown about COVID-19 is the fraction of individuals who get infected but never develop symptoms. We find that R 0 is very sensitive to this symptomatic fraction, demonstrating the importance of getting a confident measurement on this value before quantitative model predictions can be trusted.",

We find that if asymptomatics are not very contagious, and if infected individuals automatically self-isolate, then R 0 is not greatly influenced by social distancing measures. However, if asymptomatics are sufficiently infective, there is a much stronger impact of social distancing on R 0 . That said, this conclusion depends on the assumption that social distancing reduces the transmission rate of the disease, through what we called the contact rescaling factor (CoRF). Therefore, varying this parameter allows us to quantify how the nature of social distancing measures impacts R 0 . If this parameter is very small, meaning one significantly downscales their contacts (that is, the stay-at-home directives are extreme), very rapid implementation of social distancing is not required. On the other hand, if the directives are not as severe and CoRF is larger (meaning the number of contacts is scaled down less significantly), social distancing will not result in R 0 < 1 and we can still expect disease spread despite social distancing.",

One of the most striking predictions is that a slight delay in establishing social distancing guidelines (on the order of up to a month with our parameters) does not appreciably influence the course of the disease. We were initially surprised by this result, which means that authorities can take some time to plan for guidelines. However, the fact that R 0 > 1, meaning that there will be an initial exponential increase in infections no matter the strength of the guidelines, is consistent with this prediction. Notably, we also find the existence of what we term a critical implementation delay (CID), about a month in our model, where even a few days delay in implementation beyond that critical time can have highly adverse consequences. One might call this phenomenon it is OK to take some time to plan, but then implement immediately\".",

For example, businesses may be allowed to operate normally for one week, while the ensuing week is restricted to remote operation (or being fully closed, if remote work is not feasible). This two week \"periodic\" schedule is then continued either for a fixed period of time, or indefinitely (e.g. the discovery of a vaccine, evidence that sufficient herd immunity has been obtained, etc.) Using our model with estimated parameters, we simulate such schedules for a variety of periods, ranging from days to months of sanctioned activity. Our results are quite counter-intuitive, and suggest that there might be a pulsing period that significantly inhibits the infection dynamics (a 28 day \"on/off\" schedule with our parameters). However, this schedule is exceptionally sensitive to parameter values and timing, so that extreme caution must be taken when designing guidelines that fully relax social distancing, even temporarily. Furthermore, for some strategies near the optimal 28-day cycle, a subsequent increase in infected individuals may occur after an initial flattening. Thus, even if a region observes a short-term improvement, the worst may still be yet to come.",

We numerically investigate how the rate of easing social distancing guidelines affects outbreak dynamics, and show that relaxing too quickly will only delay, but not suppress, the peak magnitude of symptomatic individuals. However, a more gradual relaxation schedule will both delay onset and \"flatten the curve,\" while producing a largely immune population after a fixed policy window (again, assuming recovery corresponds to immunity, which is still an open question as of this writing). Hence the rate of relaxation is an important factor in mitigating the severity of the current pandemic. Similarly, the rate of relaxation during flattening is important to prevent a \"second wave\" of infected individuals. As governments develop and implement plans to ease social distancing, carefully considering the rate of relaxation is extremely important from a policy perspective, so that countries and states do not undo the benefits of their strict distancing policies by lifting guidelines too rapidly. For example, in our model, a very rapid relaxation schedule results in a second wave with a larger peak symptomatic proportion than originally experienced (over 21%, compared to original peak of 17.6%). However, relaxing more gradually once the peak has been obtained prevents a second outbreak, and allows a sustainable approach to herd immunity.",

Stability of the DFSS means that small perturbations of the DFSS, that is to say, the introduction of a small number of infectives into the population, results in exponential convergence back to the DFSS. In other words, the infection does not take hold in the population. Mathematically, this means that the linearization at the DFSS is described by a matrix in which all eigenvalues have negative real part (a \"Hurwitz matrix\"). Conversely, if the DFSS is unstable, then the infection will initially expand exponentially. It is important to realize, however, a very subtle and often misunderstood fact. Instability of the DFSS does not necessarily imply that the infection will keep increasing forever. Linearized analysis is only local, and says nothing about behavior over long time horizons, because nonlinear effects can dominate once the system is away from the DFSS; indeed, we will show that we find this phenomenon in our model (provided that social distancing directives are introduced).",

In particular, a larger likelihood of transitioning from asymptomatic to symptomatic dramatically increases R 0 . This occurs because both asymptomatics and symptomatics spread the disease, so spending time in both A and I means the individual has more time to spread the disease than if an individual transitions directly from the asymptomatic pool to the recovered pool. Current data makes it quite difficult to know what f is for SARS-CoV-2. Data from a cruise ship [26] , which we used to calibrate our model, found f \u2248 0.821. However, more recent data out of Italy suggests f may be closer to 0.57 [35] . Without any social distancing directives, this reduction in f would reduce R 0 from 6 to 4.5 at our baseline parameters. Further, the recognition that there may be different strains of SARS-CoV-2 could mean that f varies depending on the dominant strain in a region [41] .",

In Fig. 6 , we explore how the contagion level of the asymptomatics influences R 0 under varying rates of social distancing. We observe that if asymptomatics are not very contagious (\u03b2 A is small), then R 0 is not very sensitive to social distancing directives as measured by h 2 (R 0 -clines are almost vertical). This can be explained by our assumption that symptomatic individuals are assumed to socially distance themselves, and therefore have minimal interaction in our model with susceptibles. When this is the case, the disease is mainly spread by non-socially distanced asymptomatics. And, if the transmission rate from these individuals is small, socially distancing the asymptomatics and susceptibles has little impact on the progression of the disease. If, on the other hand, \u03b2 A is sufficiently large, than asymptomatics can fairly readily seread the disease, and we see a much strong impact of social distancing on R 0 (R 0 -clines get much less steep as \u03b2 A increases).",

However, there is a critical window about which a \"bifurcation\" occurs. For our parameters, the bifurcation value appears to be approximately 1 month. In that first month, if social distancing is begun, the outbreak will be sharply inhibited. However, near this critical value, delaying even a few extra days could drastically increase the total number of symptomatic individuals; for example, waiting 34 days yields a peak of 23% symptomatic, while waiting an extra week increases the peak to over 36%. Thus we see that policies will be effective in a certain window, and that it is critical to \u0d24 \u210e 2 Figure 9 : Social distancing control as a function of the delay t c .

However, the degree to which the peak has been suppressed is different among the relaxation schedules. It appears that high frequency pulsing (small \u2206t) does better than some extended strategies (compare \u2206t = 7 to \u2206t = 21, 35), but worse than others (compare \u2206t = 7 to \u2206t = 14 or 28).

Results indicate that gradual relaxation does have a significant effect on \"flattening the curve\" in that it results in a lower peak infected population over a larger time interval (compare t e = 60 to t e = 360 in Fig. 17 ). Fig. 18 further supports this claim, as we compute little variation in the peak for small relaxation times (corresponding to more quickly ending protocols), but that a substantial decrease in symptomatic burden is obtained as t e is increased. Indeed, for a gradual relaxation over a one year period (360 days), we see a peak symptomatic population of only 22%, which is down significantly from immediate re-openings after 60 days (42%). Note that the latter schedule does result in any significant peak mitigation when compared to the policy of no social distancing: it merely delays the same peak by approximately 46 days.

Hence, with current available measures, the best that can be accomplished is the response provided in Figure 19 , and thus it is natural to study the question of relaxation once the peak is reached (about 17.6% symptomatic at day t d = 174). Note that social distancing guidelines were ceased at day 360, and no second outbreak was subsequently observed. This agrees with our calculations of R 0 in Section 3.1 (in particular Figure 3 (a) ), which yields R 0 < 1 for h 2 = 0, R * = R(360) = 85%. Hence we expect no further outbreak after 360 days of social distancing, due to the large recovered population (an assumption in the model, but by no means experimentally verified; indeed our results will be quite different if re-infection is allowed).",

The LaSalle Invariance Principle [43] implies that all solutions converge to an invariant set \u2126 included in dN/dt = 0, meaning in particular that all solutions have I(t) \u2192 0, as claimed. Furthermore, the equation dI/dt = f \u03b3 AI (A D + A N ) \u2212 \u03b4I \u2212 \u03b3 IR I when restricted to \u2126 says that 0 = f \u03b3 AI (A D (t) + A N (t)), which means that, in this set to which all solutions converge, both A D and A N are identically zero.",

Indeed, key to our model are parameters that reflect the rate at which individuals become \"socially distant\" and the rate at which individuals return to the \"non-distanced\" category.
