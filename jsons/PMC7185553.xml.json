            "text": "Historically, mouse models of genetically determined resistance against viruses were useful to find antiviral factors involved in innate immunity. Some inbred mouse strains proved to be less susceptible to infection by specific viruses than others. In most cases, the degree of antiviral resistance was controlled by several genes, but occasionally a single gene was found to be responsible [1]. A good example is the inborn resistance against influenza and influenza-like viruses found in wild mice and some inbred mouse strains [2], [3], [4]. Forty-five years ago, Jean Lindenmann, co-discoverer of interferon with Alick Isaacs, described an inbred mouse strain which was unusually resistant when infected with doses of influenza A virus (FLUAV) that were lethal to ordinary laboratory mice [4]. Subsequent work revealed that this unusual resistance is brought about by a single gene, Mx1 (for orthomyxovirus resistance gene 1), localized on mouse chromosome 16 [5], and that the Mx1 protein has intrinsic antiviral activity [6], [7]. Unexpectedly, the Mx1 gene turned out to belong to the so-called interferon (IFN) responsive genes (ISGs) and is strictly regulated by type I (\u03b1 and \u03b2) and type III (\u03bb) IFNs [8], [9]. Gene expression is rapidly induced in viral infections through the action of virus-induced IFNs. In the absence of IFNs, the Mx gene is silent, making Mx transcripts or protein an excellent marker for type I IFN activity [10], [11].",

            "text": "In influenza virus-susceptible mice, the Mx1 gene is defective. Most inbred strains of mice carry nonfunctional Mx1 alleles [12]. Why intact Mx1 genes are absent in most inbred mouse strains remains unresolved. Most likely, the reason is a founder effect, suggesting that most laboratory mice share the distal part of chromosome 16 with a common ancestor mouse. Genetic defects present in laboratory mice but rarely in wild mice have been described for other gene loci. A single autosomal dominant gene locus, designated Flv/Wnv, is responsible for natural resistance of mice against infection with West Nile virus (WNV) and other flaviviruses. The gene was recently identified as Oas1b, a member of a large IFN-regulated gene family encoding 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetases (2\u20135 OAS) known to play an important role in antiviral defense [13], [14]. The intact Oas1b gene is again found in wild mice and some rare inbred strains but not in most laboratory strains which carry a nonsense mutation in the distal part of chromosome 5. In contrast to Mx1, comparisons of the mouse and human genomes did not reveal a direct equivalent of the mouse Oas1b gene in humans [15]. Additional examples of genetic resistance are known in mice in which single genes play a major role [16].",

The recently discovered IFN-\u03bb1, IFN-\u03bb2, and IFN-\u03bb3 (also termed IL-28A, IL-28B, and IL-29) are functionally similar to the type I IFNs but use distinct receptors to mediate their antiviral activity [19]. Conserved molecular signatures of viruses serve as \u201cdanger signals\u201d which are recognized by specialized receptors of the host cell. These receptors are collectively called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) because they recognize a diverse range of conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) found in infectious disease agents (Fig. 1\n). The main PAMP of viruses appear to be nucleic acids, such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules [20] and specific structures at the 5\u2032 end of certain viral ssRNA genomes which carry a 5\u2032 triphosphate group [21], [22]. dsRNA or 5\u2032 triphosphate moieties are usually not present on host RNA species and appear to provide an ideal recognition pattern for non-self [23].",

The IFN-\u03b2 promoter has binding sites for several transcription factors which cooperate for maximal promoter activation. There is general agreement that interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) plays a central role [24]. IRF-3 needs to be phosphorylated to become active. The enzymes responsible for IRF-3 phosphoryation have recently been demonstrated to be the IKK-like kinases IKK\u025b and TBK-1 [25], [26]. These kinases are activated by the RNA helicase RIG-1 and/or MDA5 [27], [28] and, presumably, some Toll-like receptors (TLR) [29], [30]. RIG-I and MDA5 bind dsRNA molecules and 5\u2032 triphosphorylated ssRNAs in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Phosphorylated IRF-3 homo-dimerizes and moves into the nucleus where it recruits the transcriptional coactivator, CREB-binding protein (CBP), to initiate IFN-\u03b2 mRNA synthesis [24]. In addition, NF-\u03baB and ATF-2/cJUN (AP-1) are activated as a more general stress response. Together these transcription factors strongly upregulate IFN-\u03b2 expression (Fig. 1).",

Activated IRF-7 cooperates with IRF-3 and stimulates expression of the numerous IFN-\u03b1 genes leading to a broad IFN-\u03b1 response [32]. In specialized IFN-\u03b1-producing cells, e.g. plasmacytoid dendritic cells, IRF-7 is constitutively present at high levels and is directly activated in response to signals from certain TLRs which stimulate immediate IFN-\u03b1 synthesis [33], [34].",

ISG20 is an IFN-induced 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease that specifically degrades ssRNA in vitro. Expression of ISG20 leads to a reduction in vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) gene expression and blocks viral replication in cell culture [44]. P56 binds the eukaryotic initiation factor 3e (eIF3e) subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF3 and is likely to suppress viral as well as cellular RNA translation [46], [49]. GBP-1 belongs to the dynamin superfamily of large GTPases like Mx and has antiviral activity against VSV [47]. Finally, the PML protein is a TRIM family member (also called TRIM19) which shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus where it forms a specialized subnuclear compartment known as nuclear domain-10 (ND10) or PML nuclear body. Overexpression of PML has been found to suppress replication of several viruses, including VSV, influenza A virus (FLUAV) [50], lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus [51] and human foamy retrovirus (HFV) [52]. Interestingly, cells from wild-type and PML knockout mice proved to be equally permissive for herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and FLUAV, suggesting that PML itself has no antiviral activity against these viruses [53], [54]. Rather, IFN responsiveness of cells may be influenced by PML and PML nuclear bodies, as suggested by recent findings [53].",

Numerous experiments using Mx1-congenic or Mx1-transgenic mice demonstrated that the Mx1 system is indispensable for recovery from infection with otherwise deadly influenza viruses [55]. Moreover, it became clear that the course of disease observed in Mx1-positive mice reflects quite well the characteristics of an uncomplicated acute influenza virus infection in man, indicating that these animals better mimic the innate immune system of humans than standard laboratory mice. The human ortholog, called MxA, has a broad antiviral activity against a range of different viruses. MxA-sensitive viruses include members of the bunyaviruses, orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, rhabdoviruses, togaviruses, picornaviruses, reoviruses and Hepatitis B virus, a DNA virus with a genomic RNA intermediate [41]. The mechanism of action has so far been studied for a small number of viruses only and is still incompletely understood. In general, Mx proteins were found to bind to essential viral components and to block their functions. For example, the human MxA protein accumulates in the cytoplasm of IFN-treated cells and blocks replication of the infecting virus soon after cell entry. It has been shown to target the viral capsids by recognizing the major capsid component, the viral ribonucleoprotein of some orthomyxo- and bunyaviruses [56], [57], [58]. The protective power of the human MxA GTPase is best demonstrated in MxA-transgenic mice. Human MxA was sufficient to turn susceptible Mx1-negative mice into resistant animals [59]. Moreover, even the constitutive expression of MxA in otherwise IFN-nonresponsive IFNAR0/0 animals conferred full resistance against disease, thus highlighting the importance of the human Mx system for antiviral defense [59].",

            "text": "To subvert innate immunity, many viruses interfere with one or several steps in the IFN induction pathway. The NS1 protein of influenza A virus binds to both dsRNA and ssRNA presumably by recognizing inter- or intramolecular dsRNA regions. Importantly, NS1 also associates with RIG-I in infected cells and seems to impair its signaling function [22], [67]. In contrast, the V protein of paramyxovirus SV5 has no apparent RNA-binding activity. It inhibits IFN induction by targeting the RIG-I-related RNA sensor MDA-5 [27], [68]. Next in line is the adaptor protein Cardif/IPS-1/MAVS/VISA which connects the RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5 with the IRF-3 kinases TBK-1/IKK-\u025b [69], [70], [71], [72]. It is specifically cleaved by the NS3-4A protease of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and additional flaviviruses [70], [73], [74] (see also contribution of Michael Gale in this volume). Activation of IRF-3 by TBK-1 is prevented by the phosphoprotein P of Rabies virus [75] and the G1 glycoprotein of the hantavirus NY-1 [76]. IRF-3 itself is degraded by the NPro proteins of pestiviruses such as classical swine fever virus and of bovine viral diarrhea virus [77], [78], [79] via the proteasomal pathway [80], [81]. Also, the E6 protein of human papilloma virus 16 binds and inactivates IRF-3 [82], and the proteins ORF 3b, ORF 6 and N of SARS-coronavirus directly target IRF-3 [83] to inhibit IFN induction [84]. A sophisticated strategy to block IRF-3 is used by certain herpesviruses. Human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8), the causative agent of Kaposi sarcoma, expresses several IRF homologues, termed vIRFs, which exert a dominant-negative effect [85], [86], [87], [88], [89], [90], [91].",

            "text": "An efficient way to escape the IFN response is to directly inhibit the proteins that mediate the antiviral state. IFN-regulated PKR and 2\u20135 OAS are expressed in a latent, inactive form in uninfected cells. Both enzymes need to be activated by viral dsRNA. This requirement makes them vulnerable to IFN antagonists found in many viruses. Some viruses express RNA-binding proteins which are able to prevent the activation of PKR or the 2\u20135 OAS/RNaseL system by sequestering dsRNA molecules [96], [97], [98], [99], [100], [101], [102], [103]. An alternative strategy used by viruses is to encode small RNAs which compete with dsRNA for binding to PKR, thereby preventing activation. This is the case for adenoviruses [104], HCV [105], Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [106], and HIV-1 [107]. Several viruses express proteins which either directly bind to or otherwise inactivate PKR. For example, the \u03b334.5 protein of HSV-1 triggers the dephosphorylation of eIF-2\u03b1, thus reverting the translational block established by PKR [108]. The E2 protein of HCV acts as pseudosubstrate for PKR [109], as does the Tat protein of HIV-1 [110] or the K3L protein of vaccinia virus [111]. Interestingly, FLUAV exploits a cellular pathway to block PKR in that it activates p58IPK, a cellular inhibitor of PKR [102] and NS1 to block PKR as well as the 2\u20135 OAS/RNaseL system [112], [113]. Poliovirus induces the degradation of PKR [114]. Many viruses also block the RNaseL pathway, either by expressing dsRNA-binding proteins (see above), or by other, more direct means. Encephalomyocarditis virus as well as HIV-1 induce the synthesis of RLI, a cellular RNaseL inhibitor [115], [116]. Infection with HSV-1 and HSV-2 activates the synthesis of 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate derivatives which bind and prevent RNaseL activation [117]. The Poliovirus genome contains a conserved RNA structure which inhibits RNaseL [118]. The antiviral effect of IFN is inhibited in cells infected with RSV [119], [120], an effect most probably mediated by the viral NS1 and the NS2 proteins [121], [122], [123].",

It blocks primary transcription of the incoming viral genome, a process which is performed by the associated viral polymerase. Since the virus can not transcribe and replicate its genome in the presence of Mx, generation of Mx escape mutants is virtually impossible. Therefore, a prime strategy of Mx-sensitive orthomyxoviruses is to suppress IFN production in the vertebrate host, thereby avoiding Mx expression in potential target cells. The influenza-like Thogoto virus (THOV) was recently shown to have an accessory protein with IFN-antagonistic activity. The sixth genomic segment of THOV encodes two transcripts: a spliced mRNA that codes for the matrix (M) protein and an unspliced mRNA that encodes a C-terminally extended M protein, named ML [128]. Recombinant mutant viruses were generated that lacked ML. These ML-deficient viruses were strong IFN inducers but showed otherwise no obvious growth deficits in IFN-defective cells or animals [129]. In IFN-competent Mx1-positive mice, however, the mutant virus devoid of ML was highly attenuated. In contrast, wild-type virus expressing ML were able to grow in such animals because ML was blocking IFN production [130]. Interestingly, ML inhibits the transcriptional activity of IRF-3 which is required for IFN gene expression. Recent data show that the ML protein of THOV interferes with IRF-3 dimerization and recruitment of the transcriptional coactivator CBP by activated IRF-3 [132]. The IFN-specific transcription factor IRF-3 is known to be a central player in IFN gene expression and, not surprisingly, is affected by viral proteins from many unrelated viruses (see above).",

            "text": "Another strategy of orthomyxoviruses is to escape from Mx by fast growth. In collaboration with Adolfo Garcia-Sastre at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, our group recently studied an exceptional influenza A virus strain that is highly pathogenic for Mx1-positive mice [131]. This virus acquired a number of virulence-enhancing mutations during passage in Mx1 mice. Interestingly, the highly virulent virus was still susceptible to the antiviral action of mouse Mx1 protein. Mx1-positive mice, but not Mx1-deficient mice were highly resistant to the virus if pretreated with IFN shortly before infection (Fig. 3\n). Also, the highly virulent virus was not a better inhibitor of IFN production than an ordinary influenza virus, indicating that the IFN antagonistic function of its NS1 protein did not make the difference. A series of experiments demonstrated that the highly virulent virus was able to replicate much faster in mouse lung than a normal mouse-adapted virus. It grew to about 1000 fold higher titers within the first 24 h post infection, as compared to standard virus. We concluded that the virus had a head start due to an unusually high virus multiplication speed and could outrun the establishment of the IFN-mediated antiviral Mx response. In other words, inducible host defense mechanisms can be overcome if the pathogen multiplies extremely fast. It is conceivable that highly pathogenic viruses may often profit from the fact that the IFN system requires time to become active. It remains to be seen whether a similar evasion strategy is used by other successful influenza A viruses such as the Asian H5N1 viruses or the pandemic strain of 1918.",
