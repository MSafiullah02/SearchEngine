Limitations include the lack of other tissue specimens (eg, urine and stool) and the absence of some of the newly characterized human AAV serotypes from our PCR analyses [15]. Although our assay covered the most common serotypes used for AAV vectors, it is unknown whether the frequency or clinical manifestations of the uncovered subtypes would be any different from those of subtypes 1\u20138. In summary, low-level transient AAV viremia can be detected in HCT recipients, but the incidence is low, and AAV does not appear to cause any organ-specific illness, even in a highly immunocompromised population.",
