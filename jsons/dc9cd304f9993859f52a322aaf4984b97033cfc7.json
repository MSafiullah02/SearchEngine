Nontypeable H. influenzae (NTHi) is the most common bacterium in the lower airways of children with PBB and other chronic lung diseases [5, 38, 39] . Recently, De Schutter and colleagues showed that NTHi is also the commonest cause of (nonresponsive or recurrent) community-acquired pneumonia in children [40] . Similarly, compared with controls, elevated rates of H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and S. pneumoniae infection are detected in the lower airways of children with PBB [14] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 210, "end": 213, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 214, "end": 217, "text": "38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 218, "end": 221, "text": "39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 379, "end": 383, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 553, "end": 557, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The propensity for codetection of HAdV with bacterial pathogens (eg, NTHi), has been documented in studies on human respiratory diseases [41, 42] .

They found that inflammation was greatest in the presence of both HAdV and NTHi, compared with HAdV or NTHi alone. Furthermore, timing of inoculation was important. HAdV inoculation prior to NTHi inoculation resulted in the greatest tympanic membrane inflammation and mucosal dysfunction [43] . We have previously shown that neutrophilic lower airway inflammation is maximal in the presence of viral-bacterial coinfection of the airways of children [12] .

First, although our cross-sectional data highlights important associations, we cannot attribute causality. Repeated lower airway sampling would be needed to establish the temporal sequence of lower airway infection and determine a cause-and-effect relationship. However, subjecting children to repeated general anesthesia for lower airway sampling, solely for research, would be unethical. Second, we did not include HAdV serology in our blood test panel. This ideally requires repeat venipuncture, which was not feasible in our context as many children in the study reside outside the Brisbane area. With regards to methods of HAdV detection, although culture detects infectious virus, PCR is more sensitive and is the current clinical standard [16] . Although a positive PCR for HAdV does not readily distinguish infectious from noninfectious virus, the identification of HAdV DNA indicates that infection has occurred at some stage. Further, HAdV's association with a systemic immune response (ie, elevated NK cells) supports the notion that HAdV may play a clinically relevant role. Third, we detected few conventional respiratory panel viruses (other than HAdV) and only performed extended viral panel analyses on a subset, limiting our ability to explore other possible viral-bacterial and viralviral interactions. Last, the strong relationship between age and HAdV status, and the increased odds of bacterial coinfection with HAdV in younger children, is likely to be significant.
