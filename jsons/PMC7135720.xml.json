These changes lead to an increase in basal oxygen consumption. The majority of women are more aware of their breathing, which may lead to the common complaint of shortness of breath. This is most common in the third trimester and may lead to diagnostic confusion. In late pregnancy, the diaphragmatic elevation caused by the enlarging uterus leads to a decrease in functional residual capacity (FRC), but diaphragm excursion is unaffected so vital capacity is unchanged. Pregnancy-induced physiological changes that occur in the respiratory system are summarized in Table 1\n.",

Literature addressing the effect of pregnancy on asthma is conflicting, with no consistent trend to improvement or worsening of disease severity. Some North American studies suggest that between one in five and one in nine women with asthma will have at least one admission to the emergency department, and of these, 62% will require hospitalization. The course of asthma in pregnancy in an individual woman is largely unpredictable. Women commencing pregnancy with severe or poorly controlled disease will experience worsening of symptoms, particularly in the third trimester, compared with those with mild disease. There is some evidence that the course of the disease is similar in successive pregnancies. Many asthmatics experience worsening of their symptoms during pregnancy because they stop or reduce medication due to fears (either their own or their medical advisers\u2019) about its safety. The current UK guidelines recommend prepregnancy counselling to women with asthma regarding the importance and safety of continuing their asthma medication during pregnancy to ensure good control.",

Most of this concern is misplaced, and steroids should be used to treat asthma in pregnancy in the same way and for the same reasons as in the non-pregnant state. About 90% of prednisolone is metabolized by the placenta and therefore only small quantities of the active drug reach the fetus. Several studies suggest no increased risk of abortion, stillbirth, congenital malformations, adverse fetal effects or neonatal death attributable to treating the mother with steroids. The maternal adverse effects from steroid therapy in pregnancy include increased risk of infections, reduced glucose tolerance and increased gestational diabetes. The development of hyperglycaemia (treatable with insulin) is not an indication to discontinue or decrease the dose of oral steroids, the requirement for which must be determined by the asthma. The rare, but important, psychiatric side-effects of oral glucocorticoids (with prednisolone \u2a7e30 mg) should be remembered, and all women who have been commenced on steroids should be reviewed within 1 week.",

The treatment aim is to maintain the partial pressure of oxygen greater than 60 mmHg and oxygen saturation above 95%. In severe cases, intravenous treatment with magnesium sulphate, \u03b22 agonists or aminophylline can be used as indicated. Continuous fetal assessment should be performed when asthma is uncontrolled or severe, or when the initial assessment is non-reassuring. Acute severe asthma in pregnancy should be considered as an emergency and should be treated vigorously in hospital. Provided abdominal shielding is used, a chest X-ray results in minimal exposure of the fetus to ionizing radiation, and if clinically indicated, this investigation must never be withheld just because the patient is pregnant.",

However, with enzyme supplementation and proper diet management, increasing numbers of women with pancreatic insufficiency are entering pregnancy in a relatively \u2018healthy\u2019 state. To achieve adequate weight gain in pregnancy, many will require oral, nasogastric, gastrostomy or parenteral supplementation. Rates of preterm birth are high, particularly with low maternal weights, but perinatal mortality is surprisingly low. Sometimes preterm delivery may be medically indicated in unwell women. Therapeutic termination of pregnancy may be required in very sick women, underscoring the need for effective contraception in those not wishing to get pregnant. Should the condition be complicated by CF-related diabetes, the pregnancy outcome is adversely affected. Although the outcome is consistently improving with time, it still remains inferior compared with those without CF-related diabetes. Pregnancy in lung transplant recipients with CF has been reported. Although the data are relatively limited, they seem to agree with the experience with other organ transplants. Rejection of the transplant is more common in the first 2 years, so pregnancy should ideally not be embarked upon during this time. A pregnancy undertaken more than 2 years after transplant is expected to be associated with little risk of transplant rejection, organ failure or fetal anomalies.",

            "text": "Carbon monoxide is an odourless, tasteless gas that has a high affinity for and binding to haemoglobin, thus displacing oxygen and impeding its transfer. As fetal haemoglobin has a higher afinity for carbon monoxide, fetal carboxyhaemoglobin levels are 10\u201315% higher than the mother's. Pregnant women and their fetuses do not tolerate excessive carbon monoxide inhalation. Symptoms usually appear when carboxyhaemoglobin levels are 20\u201330%. Levels over 50% may be fatal to the mother and, presumably, lower levels are fatal to the fetus. Treatment is supportive with administration of 100% or hyperbaric oxygen.Practice points\n\u2022Offer prepregnancy counselling to women with asthma regarding the importance and safety of continuing their asthma medications during pregnancy to ensure good asthma control.\u2022Monitor pregnant women with asthma closely so that any change in course can be matched with an appropriate change of treatment.\u2022For acute asthma, give drug therapy as for the non-pregnant patient. Deliver oxygen immediately to maintain saturation above 95%. Acute asthma in pregnancy should be treated vigorously in hospital.\u2022\n\u03b22 agonists, inhaled steroids, and oral or intravenous theophyllines should all be used as normal during pregnancy.\u2022Use steroid tablets as normal when indicated in pregnancy. Steroids should never be withheld because of pregnancy.\u2022Do not commence leukotriene antagonists during pregnancy. They may be continued in women who have demonstrated significant improvement in asthma control with these agents prior to pregnancy that has not been achievable with other medications.\u2022Advise women that acute asthma is rare in labour. If anaesthesia is required, regional block is preferable to general anaesthesia. Prostaglandin E2 is safe in asthmatics, but prostaglandin F2\u03b1 should be used with extreme caution because of the risk of bronchospasm.\u2022Encourage women to breastfeed. Use asthma medications as normal during lactation according to the recommendations of the manufacturer.\n\n",
