Considerable decrease of infectivity is achieved by treatment of BVDV suspensions with trypsin (0.5 mg/ ml, 37\u00b0C, 60 min). The effect of pH in the range between 5.7 and 9.3 revealed relative stability, but outside this range the infectivity decreased rapidly (Hafez and Liess, 1972b) .",

Such immune sera can neutralize BVDV as shown by experiments in calves (Baker et al., 1954) and other host systems, e.g. cell cultures of bovine origin (Noice and Schipper, 1959; Gillespie et al., 1960) . Neutralizing antibodies specifically bind to surface antigens of the BVD virion. Antibodies develop also against internal antigen(s) of the viral particle, as has been demonstrated by other serological methods. However, these methods (e.g. agargel precipitation) are less suitable for the identification of BVDV strains and their differentiation from the closely related HCV (Darbyshire, 1962). Work on monoclonal antibodies has lead to the identification of viral proteins that are type-or strain-specific. Within the nonarbo togavirus group, no cross-reaction occurs between rubella virus, equine arteritis virus, lactic dehydrogenase virus and the pestiviruses (Horzinek, 1981) . The only serologically related viruses are HCV and BVDV. This relationship is expressed not only by common soluble antigens detected by, for example, agar double diffusion test (Gutekunst and Malmquist, 1963) , but also by the presence of neutralizing antibodies against BVDV in pig sera (Snowdon and French, 1968) .",

The quantitative differences have their basis in the existence of either (i) a common and a type-specific antigen in the membrane, or (ii) a variable type-specific antigen, which would also explain the antigenic variation amongst strains of BVDV. The latter has been well established, mainly by neutralization using immune sera prepared against different BVDV strains in calves (Gillespie et al., 1961; Castrucci et al., 1975) . In order to exclude individual differences, groups of pigs have been inoculated with low virulent strains of HCV and mean antibody titers plotted against heterologous HCV as well as BVDV strains. Distinct profiles have been obtained, reflecting the antigenic variation of BVDV and the relationship amongst the strains tested ( Fig. 100 ).",

(intranasal virus application by atomizer) as reported by Mills and Luginbuhl (1968) appears insufficient to claim viral persistence. In the present context it is meant that BVDV persists lifelong (e.g. in bufify coat cells) without causing clinical signs of BVD. This state was attributed to specific immune tolerance by Liess (1973) and Coria and McClurkin (1978) . Specific unrespon-siveness of the humoral immune system to BVDV in a highly contaminated milieu was suggested by Holling (1971) . Johnson and Muscoplat (1973) investigated immunologic abnormalities in calves with the chronic BVD syndrome and offered two theories for the unresponsiveness of lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin stimulation as well as a deficient humoral response: (i) immunosuppression as an effect of the disease, and (ii) immunologic unresponsiveness as a factor in the cause of the disease. Neither of these theories could be verified by the available data. Shope et al. (1976) studied the role of cellular immunity and passive antibody in protecting neonatal calves against primary BVDV infection using administration of corticosteroids (0.5mg/kg/day for 10 days). They observed that after intratracheal infection calves without antibody died while others with high levels of passively transferred antibodies, under otherwise similar conditions, did not. In contrast, administration of 0.5-1 mg/kg/day starting 3 days before oral and nasal inoculation of a field strain of BVDV resulted in only mild clinical symptoms (Rohde and Liess, 1970) . Shope et al. (1976) concluded that \"severe fatal viremia in immunosuppressed calves apparently resulted in more extensive dissemination of BVD virus to target organs, particularly lymphoid tissue\".",

The fact that immunoglobulins G x , G 2 and M could not be detected in precolostral sera of eleven persistently BVD-infected calves was attributed to insensitivity of the test and to complexing of Ig with BVDV, since virus was isolated from all sera (Coria et al., 1983) . Using a more sensitive test procedure, Coulibaly (1984) was able to demonstrate a significantly decreased IgG 2 concentration in sera of 20 healthy, persistently BVD-infected cattle in the range of 7 months to 7 years of age. This confirmed results obtained by Steck et al. (1980) from cattle fatally affected by the BVD-MD syndrome. Depletion of circulating \u0392 and \u03a4 lymphocytes -the latter in particular - (Bolin et al., 1985a) , as well as a depressed response to mitogen stimulation of \u0392 and \u03a4 lymphocytes reflects the influence of BVDV on the immune system. Whether immunosuppression plays a role in the fatal outcome of BVDV infections still needs to be shown. Corticosteroid treatment may have a suppressive effect on local antibody formation only. It appears somewhat unlikely that neutralizing antibody controls viremia, as suggested by Shope et al. (1976) , since BVDV infectivity is intimately associated with leukocytes in the peripheral blood and persisted up to 40 days p.i. (Mills and Luginbuhl, 1968) ; in the presence of neutralizing antibodies virus could be recovered for at least 10 days (Rohde and Liess, 1970) .",

It has been presumed that this phenomenon is due to immunologic tolerance as a consequence of antigenic experience at or before birth (Malmquist, 1968) . Although after exposure to low-passage BVDV some neonatal calves died (Liess, 1967; Lambert et al., 1969) , the cause of fatal BVDV infections and the role of immunologic tolerance remained obscure. Nevertheless, cases of fatal BVDV infections have to be expected among the seronegative animals in herds where a high percentage of heifers and cows is seropositive to BVDV. On the other hand, selection of seronegative animals in a highly contaminated environment offers the chance of finding persistently infected animals that will die sooner or later (Liess et al., 1974) . This hypothesis resulted in the detection of persistently BVDV-infected calves, heifers, young bulls and pregnant cows which were followed up for longer periods of time (McClurkin et al., 1979; Liess et al., 1983) . Most of these persistently infected animals were probably exposed to BVDV during intrauterine life; B\u00fcrki and Germann (1964) and Romvary (1965) had reported BVDV infections in newborn and day-old calves.",

MD may also be a consequence of a mutation of the persistently infecting NC-BVDV to a C-BVDV (Brownlie et al., 1986; Howard et al., 1987) . The latter hypothesis is supported by results of cross-neutralization tests. A C-and a NC-strain, being a pair of strains derived from a certain case of MD, were indistinguishable from each other but different from pairs of strains isolated from other cases of MD . Larsson (1987) studied the activities of mononuclear cells (MNC) in peripheral blood during MD and persistent infection with BVDV. Cattle with MD commonly showed normal MNC counts but with an altered composition of subpopulations. The mean proportion of Ig-bearing cells (B cells) was increased, while cells being neither Ig + nor attaching the \u03a4 cell marker Helix pomatia A hemagglutinin (HP) were decreased. The proportion of mononuclear phagocytes and their phagocytic capacity varied within the normal range. Persistently infected healthy cattle did not show the altered composition of MNC as seen in cattle with MD. During MD and subclinical persistent infection, the proliferative response of MNC to mitogens was suppressed, which was partly due to an increased suppressor activity of cells with receptors for the Fc part of IgG (Fc. + cells), but not by an increased number of these cells. Almost 70% of te Fcy+ cells attached to HP, indicating that these cells with suppressor activity are a subset of \u03a4 cells.",

The situation became even more complicated when a group of syndromes, some of which were later recognized as being etiologically different from BVD, was referred to as \"mucosal diseases of cattle\" (FMD, rinderpest, IBR, etc.).

This chronic syndrome was characterized by interdigital hyperkeratosis and ulceration, diarrhea, dehydration, weakness and failure to thrive. Malmquist (1968) had mentioned that calves with MD had persistent viremia and failed to develop neutralizing antibodies over extended periods, the longest being approximately 4 months. The animals remained unthrifty, but it was not the \"slow-gainer or poor-doer that became sick, because frequently it had been sick for some time\".

            "text": "Immune-competent susceptible cattle respond to BVDV with the production of usually high titering neutralizing antibodies which are highly specific as to the antigenic variant strain used. This has been convincingly shown by Steck et al. (1980) in vaccination experiments using viremic animals. They were sero-negative to the homologous isolate as well as to the vaccine strain before vaccination and remained so when tested against the homologous BVDV strain but developed high neutralizing titers against the vaccine strain. Recently this finding has been confirmed when testing persistently viremic cattle in the field . However, immune-competent animals infected with one strain are obviously immune to heterologous strains and also develop neutralizing antibodies to these strains. Variant strains are differentiated by measuring neutralizing antibody titers, which show higher values against the homologous than against heterologous strains. Each strain is recognized specifically by immune-competent cattle and pigs as shown in Fig. 100 (Malmquist, 1968; Castrucci et al., 1974; Liess et al., 1977) . In summary, the BVDV strain which induces immune tolerance will not be recognized immunologically even after the fetal organism has acquired immune competence, while other strains are recognized resulting in strain specific antibody formation. Calves born to infected dams take up maternal BVDV antibodies by ingesting colostrum. Within 24-48 h all calves in a naturally infected herd possess antibodies. The serum titers decline exponentially to undetectable levels between 105 and 230 days, depending on the level of the initial titers (Malmquist, 1968; Kendrick and Franti, 1974) . For high, medium, and low initial values Kendrick and Franti (1974) expected the titer to approach zero in approximately 230, 165, and 105 days, respectively. The half-life of neutralizing antibodies in sera of colostrum-fed calves was calculated to be 19-20 days (Landelius, 1977) .",

(1980) described microscopic lesions in the kidneys of persistently infected cattle and BVDV antigen in mesangial and endothelial cells of glomeruli. This suggests an immune-mediated reaction with deposition of small amounts of antibody (incomplete immune tolerance) complexed with viral antigen in the renal glomeruli along the basement membrane, similar to the situation in lymphocytic choriomeningitis of mice (Oldstone and Dixon, 1969) . Immune complexes have indeed been demonstrated in renal glomeruli of persistently BVDV-infected cattle in exactly the same locations as reported by others (Prager and Liess, 1976) .",

For virus isolation blood samples are suitable that contain heparin or EDTA to prevent coagulation and to facilitate separation and collection of the leukocyte fraction after low-speed centrifugation. After washing and resuspension, the buffy coat leukocytes are inoculated into cultures of susceptible bovine cells. After incubation for some days at 37\u00b0C the cell-culture fluids are collected for further passages, preferably in established monolayer cell cultures. These are examined for the presence of BVDV by fluorescent antibody, enzyme-linked antibody or interference, especially if it concerns a NC strain. C-BVDV strains are detected in only few instances; NC strains are frequently isolated from persistently infected healthy animals (Coria and McClurkin, 1978) and even more so from chronically affected cattle .",

This stimulated field studies on the transmissibility and the possible fetopathogenic effects of BVDV after administration of a commercial live virus vaccine to dams during the first half of gestation, commencing on gestational day 51. The vaccine was applied to seronegative pregnant cattle in herds where less than 50% of the animals had neutralizing antibodies. Five abortions occurred between 8 and 60 days after vaccination, but BVDV infection was confirmed in only one of three cases submitted to the laboratory. Five calves with torticollis and opisthotonus, ataxia or astasia were born at term (their dams had been vaccinated between 90 and 118 days of gestation); nine calves had precolostral viremia which persisted until the animals were sold or sacrificed because of chronic disease (Fig. 101) . One calf became 2 years old and showed growth retardation but appeared otherwise normal. Calves born with persistent viremia usually had no precolostral antibody except three with very low titers . This demonstrates the hazard caused by vaccines which have not been properly tested. It cannot be decided whether it was the vaccine virus or a BVD field virus which had been picked up and caused the effects. Bovine cell cultures used for the propagation of any vaccine virus need proper pretesting in order to rule out dissemination of BVD field virus by vaccination.",

According to Kahrs et al. (1966) this immunity lasts for about 9 months; it correlates with the presence of maternally derived neutralizing antibody (Robson et al., 1960) . The rates of antibody decline are similar in calves from vaccinated and naturally immune dams with a calculated half-life of 19-20 days (Landelius, 1977) . A shorter duration resulted from lower initial titers (Kahrs et al., 1966) or was due to the use of antigenically different strains of BVDV, as shown in Fig. 102 . Since frequent revaccination is not feasible, one or two vaccinations might assure successful immunization of the greatest number of calves at the earliest possible age.",

Therefore, live BVDV vaccines should probably be applied locally, for example by intranasal instillation. Although there are no reports on pertinent studies available it should be remembered that the intranasal route has been used successfully for challenge with BVDV in several investigations. Immunity and neutralizing antibodies were efficiently induced. Veterinary control measures rely on diagnostic tools to detect persistently infected cattle and on vaccination using safe vaccines. While there is no question that persistently BVDV infected animals should be eliminated from a herd, the application of a live virus vaccine to the seronegative group should be considered under various aspects. The vaccine should be applied well before breeding age and prior to situations involving a high risk of exposure. However, vaccination becomes a gamble as soon as antibody prevalence within the parent population approaches 50%; then also 50% of the newborn calves would receive maternal antibodies.",
