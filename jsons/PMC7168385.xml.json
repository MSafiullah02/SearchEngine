The novel coronavirus that causes SARS (SARS\u2010CoV) is an enveloped virus with a positive\u2010strand RNA genome of approximately 30 000 nucleotides. The virus particle consists of an RNA genome and four major structural proteins: the N, S, M, and E proteins. Coronaviruses are thought to assemble in the ER\u2013Golgi intermediate compartment through the interaction of structural proteins (4). However, information concerning the interactions of the SARS\u2010CoV structural proteins is extremely limited.",

It has been proposed that the N protein functions in viral RNA replication and protein translation (7, 8). The S protein is a type\u2010I glycoprotein that plays a role in viral entry by binding to the SARS\u2010CoV receptor, ACE2, which is expressed on the surface of target cells (9). However, the S protein is not thought to be required for virus assembly (10). The M protein, a triple\u2010spanning membrane protein, is the most abundant protein in the virion. The cytoplasmic C\u2010terminal domain of the M protein interacts with the N protein, whereas the N\u2010terminal domain is exposed on the extracellular side of the virion (11, 12). The E protein, which is present in small amounts, is a transmembrane protein that may function as a viroporin (13).",

Primers were designed to add an N\u2010terminal HA tag to the M protein, a C\u2010terminal FLAG tag to the E protein, and a C\u2010terminal HA tag to the S protein.

The N\u2010 and S\u2010protein peaks were detected in fraction 6 (Fig. 2) of the 20\u201350% sucrose gradient. The density of this fraction (1.157 g/cm3) was similar to that reported previously for VLP\u2010containing fractions (10, 14, 19), indicating that the N and S proteins in fraction 6 were secreted as SARS\u2010CoV VLP. The N protein, but not the S protein, was also detected in fractions 3 and 4 (density, 1.08\u20131.10 g/cm3; Fig. 2). The peaks of fractions 3 and 4 may represent aggregates of N protein released from broken cells. These results suggest that SARS\u2010CoV VLP are formed in cells that express the N, M, E, and S proteins and are secreted into the culture medium.
