            "text": "Starting from the premise that the passport is primarily a document which establishes the identity of the holder,6 the various approaches7 taken by ICAO in advancing technologies that facilitate this task at borders have evolved into the use of biometric identification of the passport holder as the ultimate frontier in the identification process. The techniques of biometrics employed in a machine readable travel document (MRTD), be it a visa or passport,8 enable the user to uniquely encode a particular physical characteristic of a person into a biometric identifier or biometric template which can be verified by machine to confirm or deny a claim regarding a person\u2019s identity. Accordingly, biometric identification of a person either correctly establishes his identity as being consistent with what is claimed in the passport he is holding or brings to bear the possibility that the person carrying a particular passport is an imposter. A biometric is a measurable, physical characteristic or personal behavioral trait used to recognize the identity, or verify9 the claimed identity of a person. In the modern context, biometrics are usually incorporated in an MRTD with a view to achieving five goals, the first of which is global interoperability10 enabling the specifications of biometrics deployed in travel documents across the world to be applied and used in a universally operable manner. This is a critical need if the smooth application of biometric technology were to be ensured across borders. The second goal is to ensure uniformity within States in specific standard setting by States authorities who deploy biometrics in travel documents issued by them. The third is technical reliability, where States are required to ensure that technologies used in deploying biometrics are largely failure-proof and of sufficient quality and standard to ensure a State immigration authority reading documents issued by other States them that the details in the document do provide accurate verification of facts. Fourthly, the technology used has to be practical and not give rise to the need for applying disparate types of support technology at unnecessary cost and inconvenience to the user. The final goal is to ensure that the technology used will be sufficiently up to date for at least 10 years and also be backwardly compatible with new techniques to be introduced in the future.",

The action was grounded on the basis that two of the passengers in the passenger list earlier provided to the US authorities were on a \u201cno fly\u201d list. The importance of this drama to modern day aviation is that the aircraft was merely over-flying the territory of a State. Even more important is the fact that at the time of the incident, there was no US legislation covering the act of refusal to grant over-flying permission to an aircraft in that situation.15 However, within days, The US Transportation Security Administration (TSA) announced that rules will be adopted to require that passengers on all flights landing in and overflying US territory will be screened against a \u201cno fly\u201d list.16\n",

For example, information captured through reservations created by international sales organizations (global distribution systems \u201cGDS\u201d or computer reservation systems \u201cCRS\u201d) with pertinent details of the PNR could be transmitted to the operating carrier(s). When reservations are made directly by the aircraft operator and the complete PNR is stored within the operator\u2019s automated reservations systems, the information therein could be a useful repository of PNR data. Information contained in records of some operators who may hold sub-sets of the PNR data within their own automated departure control systems (DCS), for their information or for onward transmittal to contracted ground handling service providers, calculated to support airport check-in functions would be another way in which PNR data could be provided. However, it must be noted that in each case, operators (or their authorized agents) will have access to, and be able to amend only that data that has been provided to their system(s). An important consideration in this regard is that some DCS systems are programmed such that details emerging from check-in (i.e. seat and/or baggage information) can be overlaid into the existing PNR for each passenger.

Since an aircraft operator is obliged to comply with the laws of both the State from which it transports passengers (State of departure) and the State to which these passengers are transported (destination State), when a destination State legislates with regard to its PNR data transfer requirements, it should do so cognizant of the fact that existing laws of other States may affect operators\u2019 ability to comply with these requirements. Therefore, where there could be an inconsistency between two legal regimes of the departure State and the destination State, or where a conflict arises between any two States, or where an operator advises of a conflict, The ICAO guidelines suggest that the States involved should consult each other to determine what might be done to enable affected operators to continue to operate within the bounds of the laws in both States.",

The most fundamental principle of public international law, that of State sovereignty, is embodied in Article 1 of the Chicago, thus importing the principle into the tenets of air law. This Article provides that Contracting States recognize that every State has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the air space above its territory. The territory of a State, for the purposes of the Convention, cover the land areas and territorial waters adjacent to and under the sovereign, suzerainty, protection and mandate of the State concerned.29 Arguably, these provisions would give the United States the right in limine to prescribe requirements on aircraft flying over its territory. Article 12 of the Chicago Convention provides, inter alia, that each contracting State undertakes to adopt measures to insure that every aircraft flying over or manoeuvring within its territory and that every aircraft carrying its nationality mark, wherever that aircraft may be, shall comply with the rules and regulations relating to the flight and manoeuvre of aircraft there in force. This rule can apply to a foreign carrier who is over-flying the territory of any State having a regulation that certain data pertaining to a flight that over-flies its territory has to be submitted to that State. Also important is Article 9 of the Convention, which allows a Contracting State to restrict or prohibit an aircraft from flying over its territory for reasons of military necessity or public safety. The provision goes on to say that each contracting State could also reserve the right, in exceptional circumstances or during a period of emergency, or in the interest of public safety and with immediate effect, temporarily to restrict or prohibit flying over the whole or part of its territory, provided such action would apply without distinction of nationality to aircraft of all States.30\n",

There is no doubt that the same position prevails even now, particularly through the currently applicable International Air Services Transit Agreement (IASTA) which was concluded at the same time as the Chicago Convention in December 1944 and has been ratified by many ICAO Contracting States. IASTA allows aircraft of foreign States freedom of peaceful transit (over the airspace of a State) and freedom of making non-traffic (non-revenue) stops for such purposes as refuelling and repair. It has been acknowledged that without these two freedoms, the air transport industry could not survive33\n",

Nation States are becoming more interdependent, making decisions made by a particular State in its own interest have a significant negative impact on the interests of other States. Therefore ethics in foreign policy has largely become a construct which combines cultural, psychological and ideological value structures. Within this somewhat complex web of interests, decisions have to be made, which, as recent events in history have shown, require a certain spontaneity from the international community. For example, when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, the members of the United Nations chose economic sanctions against Iraq, claiming that war was the last resort to be embarked upon against Iraq if economic sanctions did not prove to have any effect. In hindsight, one could argue one way or another, firstly, as did the United States, that the use of force bore quick results and, on the hand, as did many officials in Paris, Moscow, Ottawa and Washington, that the decision to wage war against Iraq was too precipitous as not enough time had been given to economic sanctions to compel Iraq to retreat from Kuwait. The precipitous but quick action taken in going to war with Iraq might be justified by some with the analogy of Britain appeasing Hitler in the 1930s without adopting a more aggressive and perhaps belligerent attitude toward German atrocities. This action, which was later labeled as folly by most political scientists, was applauded and endorsed at that time in the British Parliament. In the absence of extra territoriality the only balancing factor in favor of State which orders the diversion of an aircraft over-flying its territory, on the basis that persons therein are unacceptable is to have sound justification for doing so in the interests of security and safety.",

He emphasizes that:The principal benefit of the causality based approach is that it avoids the automatic rejection of direct State responsibility merely because of the absence of an agency relationship.

The provision goes on to say that measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defense will be immediately reported to the Security Council and will not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.",

However, as the case law cited in this article reflects, these measures have to conform to the constitutional guarantees given to citizens, one of which is the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In this context, the consent of the individual selected for a full body screen is essential and a full body scan taken by the State or an instrumentality of that State without a person\u2019s consent would tantamount to a breach of the Fourth Amendment. In the final analysis, however, the State is answerable to the public to show that it took every measure to avoid clear and present danger. The responsibility of a State for private acts of individuals which unlawfully interfere with civil aviation is determined by the quantum of proof available that could establish intent or negligence of the State, which in turn would establish complicity or condonation on the part of the State concerned. One way to determine complicity or condonation is to establish the extent to which the State adhered to the obligation imposed upon it by international law and whether it breached its duty to others. In order to exculpate itself, the State concerned will have to demonstrate that either it did not tolerate the offence (by using such measures as body scanners) or that it ensured the punishment of the offender. Brownlie is of the view that proof of such breach would lie in the causal connection between the private offender and the State.93 In this context, the act or omission on the part of a State is a critical determinant particularly if there is no specific intent.94 Generally, it is not the intent of the offender that is the determinant but the failure of a State to perform its legal duty in either preventing the offence (if such was within the purview of the State) or in taking necessary action with regard to punitive action or redress.95\n",

IATA further suggested that acceptance of such coffins is dependent upon the type of aircraft, requirements of entry and clearance and prior approval of the countries of origin, transit and destination.108 The Council noted that comments on the carriage of coffins had been received from 27 States (from a total of 72 member States at that time) and two overseas territories. Three of these States reported that they were bound by the provisions of the 1937 Berlin Agreement and Eight States advised ICAO that the carriage of corpses existed in their national legislations. Thirteen States commented that they had not, in their experience encountered serious difficulties in this area. The United States made the comment:Because of known effects of rare atmosphere at high altitude on sealed caskets, such caskets should not be carried by aircraft.109\n\n",

The ICAO guidance goes on to say that legislation often requires a post mortem examination of those killed in an accident and in some instances there may be remains that cannot be identified.112 ICAO also calls for personal effects of the deceased to be correctly handled and returned to their lawful owners.113 The Guidance also calls for the State of occurrence to provide for the return of human remains114 while also devolving that burden\u2014of the carriage of such remains\u2014upon the aircraft operator involved in the accident.115\n",
