            "text": "While everybody has been worrying about when the influenza A/H5N1 virus (H5N1) will adapt well enough in human to cause a pandemic, the emergence of a novel swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus (S-OIV) has shocked the world [1] [2] [3] . On 11 June 2009, the World Health Organization raised the pandemic alert level from phase 5 to phase 6. As of 3 July, there were 89,921 laboratory-confirmed cases of S-OIV infections and 382 confirmed deaths globally. The S-OIV genome is made up of a unique combination of gene segments that had not been observed in previously known influenza A viruses. Although the sequences of all the 8 gene segments are most closely related to those of swine isolates in the last 10-20 years, some are also homologous to those of previously found human or avian isolates, but with lower similarities. The first report on the clinical features of 642 confirmed cases of S-OIV infections in the United States showed that most patients presented with upper respiratory and systemic symptoms similar to those of seasonal influenza [1] . Most of the cases were self-limited, with 9% of patients hospitalized and only 2 deaths [1] . On the other hand, more recent reports on the epidemic in the Mexican population described apparently higher number of deaths, espe-cially in persons !60 years old, although the total number of cases of S-OIV infection, the denominator for calculating the mortality rate, was not certain [4, 5] .",

            "text": "Influenza viruses associated with seasonal influenza cause tissue damage mainly through virus-induced cell death. On the other hand, H5N1 infections in humans were associated with a massive cytokine storm, which had resulted in a high number of deaths [6] [7] [8] . Recently, we discovered that treatment with the triple combination of zanamivir, celecoxib, and mesalazine significantly decreased the mortality in mice infected by H5N1 when compared with zanamivir alone [9] . Moreover, the triple combination of zanamivir, celecoxib, and mesalazine was also associated with marked reduction in inflammatory markers [9] . Therefore, it is of both biological interest and practical importance to understand the cytokine profiles induced by S-OIV versus H5N1 and seasonal influenza virus, because this knowledge will aid in the design of treatment strategies for future cases of S-OIV infections. In this study, we compared the cytokine profiles of macrophages infected by a highly pathogenic strain of H5N1, 2 strains of S-OIV, or a strain of influenza A/ H1N1 virus (H1N1) and also evaluated the paracrine effects on A549 cells of macrophages infected by the different viruses. The implications of our results are discussed. [10] , and A/Hong Kong/403946.

Viruses were harvested when \u223c75% of the cell monolayer manifested cytopathic effect. The median tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) was determined by using MDCK cells according to the Reed-Muench method [11] .

Although the data available so far suggested that the present S-OIV is not associated with particular high mortality rates, the rate associated with the ancestor of S-OIV, the classic swine influenza A (H1N1) virus, was higher than that associated with seasonal influenza [14] . In a review of 50 cases of apparent zoonotic swine influenza virus infection, a case fatality rate of 14% was observed [14] . Because no animal model was available for S-OIV infection during the time of our study, we used human macrophages harvested from healthy blood donors to determine whether S-OIV infection is associated with more marked cytokine induction than seasonal influenza, although not as severe as in H5N1 infection.",

Among the 12 detectable cytokines, all 8 markedly induced by H5N1 are proinflammatory cytokines, whereas 1 of the other 4 that showed similar levels among the 4 viruses, IL-1 receptor antagonist, is a major antiinflammatory cytokine. On the other hand, neither S-OIV strain was associated with such a cytokine storm, with overall mRNA and cytokine levels similar to those seen in seasonal H1N1 (Figures 1-3) . This finding is in line with the apparent relatively low mortality observed currently in most countries outside Mexico in the present influenza pandemic.",

It is possible that high cytokine levels, reactive hemophagocytosis, and multiorgan failure could be present in patients with severe S-OIV infections with high viral loads. Additional experiments using higher MOIs would be necessary to determine whether higher cytokine responses could be associated with higher viral load in the present cell line model.

Recently, we documented that zanamivir plus celecoxib (COX-2 inhibitor) and mesalazine (inhibitor of inflammation widely used for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease) significantly decreased the mortality associated with H5N1 infection, compared with zanamivir alone in a mouse model [9] . This was due to a modulation of the cytokine storm associated with H5N1 infection, indicated by a suppression of the inflammatory markers [9] . This finding is in line with those in our study, which showed that celecoxib plus mesalazine suppressed 6 of the 8 proinflammatory cytokines markedly induced by H5N1 (Figures 1 and 2) . Others have also shown that selective COX-2 inhibitors suppressed the hyperinduction of cytokines in the proinflammatory cascade in H5N1-infected macrophages [16] . Because our study showed that S-OIV was not associated with a major cytokine storm and S-OIV infections were not clinically associated with major mortality, most patients should be treated with oseltamivir or zanamivir. However, for individual patients with S-OIV infection who have severe primary viral pneumonia with severe sepsis and multiorgan failure, immunomodulators may be considered as an adjunctive therapy in clinical trials. Because we previously showed that the addition of immunomodulators 48 h after H5N1 challenge were very effective in decreasing both the mortality rate and cytokine storm in a mouse model [9] , such adjunctive treatment may theoretically be useful even after the start of a severe systemic inflammatory response.",

S-OIV-CA was isolated from a patient in California on 1 April 2009, whereas S-OIV-HK was isolated from a patient in Hong Kong on 30 April [10] . For the 6 cytokines with mRNA expression levels assayed, the levels of all 6 were higher for S-OIV-CA-infected macrophages than for S-OIV-HK infected macrophages ( Figure 3 ). Although this phenomenon was shown by the cytokine assay only for the IL-8 level, this may be because relatively small differences can be picked up only by the more sensitive RT-PCR assay. This explanation is in line with the fact that TNF-a and IFN-g expressions were detected only by RT-PCR and not by the cytokine assays for all 4 viruses. We speculate that this attenuation of the virus may explain the relatively higher number of deaths in the Mexican population during the early phase of the pandemic. Sequencing the S-OIV-HK genome and comparative genomic analysis would reveal whether the virus was rapidly evolving in April 2009.",

It has been observed that the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic was also mild initially, but the mortality was markedly increased in the second wave during the influenza season [17] . As a temporal series of the virus is not available, we do not know if this was due to an increase in virulence of the virus. However, the reverse genetically reconstructed 1918 H1N1 virus was shown to induce lethal pneumonia with proinflammatory damage and cytokine storm similar to that of the H5N1 virus in mouse, ferrets and monkey models [18, 19] . The present S-OIV was a result of multiple reassortment. Therefore, it would not be surprising if there is further reassortment and/or mutation, giving rise to more virulent phenotypes as the pandemic evolves in the coming months.",

This is similar to the situation in the 2008-2009 influenza season, when most H1N1 viruses that circulated were resistant to oseltamivir though still susceptible to zanamivir [21, 22] . Another scenario that would be at least as disastrous would be acquisition of virulence genes, such as NS or PB1-F2, from viruses such as H5N1, giving rise to a highly infectious and fatal virus. Therefore, as the pandemic evolves, strains of S-OIV should be monitored not only for antiviral resistance but also for their virulence potential, using the present cell line model as an alternative to the less available animal models [23, 24] . Because ferret and mice models of S-OIV infection showed marked viral replication in lungs and seasonal influenza replicated mainly in the nasopharynx, there is reason to believe that more cytokine induction may occur in S-OIV, because the lung is a large organ with many reticuloendothelial cells. Because mRNA levels can be detected more sensitively than the corresponding cytokine levels, detection of mRNA levels with RT-PCR would be more sensitive for monitoring the evolving the virulence potential of the virus. Monitoring its genome sequence in the coming second wave in winter is also important to determine whether there is continued attenuation or increased virulence in correlation with the clinical scenario.",
