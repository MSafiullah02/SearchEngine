            "text": "How host cells recognize many kinds of RNA and DNA viruses and initiate innate antiviral responses against them has not yet been fully elucidated. Over the past decade, investigations into the mechanisms underlying these antiviral responses have focused extensively on immune surveillance sensors that recognize virus-derived components (such as lipids, sugars and nucleic acids). The findings of these studies have suggested that antiviral responses are mediated by cytosolic or intracellular compartment sensors and their adaptor molecules (e.g., TLR, myeloid differentiation primary response 88, retinoic acid inducible gene-I, IFN-\u03b2 promoter stimulator-1, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase and stimulator of IFN genes axis) for the primary sensing of virus-derived nucleic acids, leading to production of type I IFNs, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by the host cells. Thus, host cells have evolved an elaborate host defense machinery to recognize and eliminate virus infections. In turn, to achieve sustained viral infection and induce pathogenesis, viruses have also evolved several counteracting strategies for achieving immune escape by targeting immune sensors, adaptor molecules, intracellular kinases and transcription factors. In this review, we discuss recent discoveries concerning the role of the cytosolic nucleic acid-sensing immune response in viral recognition and control of viral infection. In addition, we consider the regulatory machinery of the cytosolic nucleic acid-sensing immune response because these immune surveillance systems must be tightly regulated to prevent aberrant immune responses to self and non-self-nucleic acids.",

            "text": "Vertebrate cells possess PRRs to enable detection of pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites. Immediately after a pathogen invades the cells, the PRRs detect different combinations of pathogen-specific molecules, such as lipids, sugars, and nucleic acids, called pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and activate an innate antiviral response to eliminate the pathogens [1] . Among the molecules composing the pathogen-associated molecular patterns, pathogen-derived nucleic acids are the most potent mediators of innate antiviral responses. The primary induction of innate antiviral responses through detection of nucleic acids is also critical for subsequent induction of an acquired immunity response. Over the past ten years, the responsible immune surveillance sensors, such as the TLRs, cytosolic RNA sensors (primary RIG-I/ MDA5), cytosolic DNA sensors (primary cGAS and others), and sensors of the inflammasome pathway (e.g., the primary NLR family, which consists of two major subfamilies, NLRC and NLRP), have been well characterized [2] [3] [4] . These immune surveillance sensors are ubiquitously expressed, enabling detection of pathogens invading at the cell surface and cytoplasmic or nuclear compartment in several cell types and leading to production of type I IFNs, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines by host cells. However, it has also been suggested that these immune surveillance systems must be tightly regulated to prevent aberrant immune responses to especially self-nucleic acids derived from damaged cells, senescent cells, apoptotic cells and fertilization [5, 6] . Indeed, RIG-I, the cytosolic sensor for RNA, distinguishes self from non-self RNA through its interaction with 5\u2032-triphosphate or 5\u2032-diphosphate, which are not present in the transcribed RNA species in vertebrate cells [1] . Both RIG-I and MDA5 are also known to sense the synthetic or viral dsRNA; additionally, MDA5 may also detect dsRNA with a high molecular weight, in contrast to the preferential detection of short dsRNA by RIG-I [7] . Studies using genetically engineered mice have revealed that RIG-I is crucial for detection of several negative-stranded RNA viruses (e.g., vesicular stomatitis virus, NDV and influenza A and B virus), as well as detection of positivestranded RNA viruses (e.g., JEV and HCV) [8] . In contrast, MDA5 dominantly detects picornaviruses (e.g., encephalomyocarditis virus). Though exceptions to this requirement have been reported, the ability of RIG-I and MDA5 to distinguish self from non-self in this way ensures that anomalous immune responses to cellular RNA do not occur. Responses to self-DNA such as those described above are far less clear. Cytoplasmic DNA-sensing by cGAS in collaboration with an adaptor protein, STING, does not distinguish between cellular and pathogen-derived DNA [9, 10] . Of note, it has also been reported that the chronic inflammatory response induced by self-DNA via cGAS/STING may be responsible for induction of aberrant inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, AGS and polyarthritis [9, 10] . While engulfed apoptotic cells represent a possible source of self-DNA, endogenous DNases in both the cytoplasmic (e.g., DNase-III, also referred to as TREX1) and lysosomal (e.g., DNase-II) compartments can degrade these endogenous self-DNAs and ensure that inappropriate responses are not initiated [9, 10] . In the case of the leaking of mitochondrial DNA into the cytoplasm following mitochondrial damage, intracellular caspase activation can control the aberrant immune response [11] [12] [13] . Similarly, cGAS/STING and its necessary cofactors and cellular DNA are compartmentalized such that sensing of self-DNA is avoided; the receptor in the cytosol and the ligand (DNA) in the nucleus are sequestered [9] . Additionally, recent studies have shown that cell cycle progression during mitosis following a DNA-damage response may lead to formation of micronuclei, thereby eliciting a cGAS/STING-mediated micronuclear DNAsensing immune response [14, 15] . Then, following DNA damage and micronuclei formation, cGAS may re-localize to the micronuclei bodies and recognize micronuclear DNA, followed by initiation of downstream signal activation. In addition to the DNA-damage response discussed above, two independent research groups have also reported that the cGAS/STING axis also recognizes an intrinsic DNA during cellular senescence and that this activation precedes induction of an inflammatory response (this is defined as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype) [16, 17] . Subsequently, production of senescence-associated secretory phenotype factors such as inflammatory cytokines and chemokines may reinforce senescence-associated cells via autocrine and paracrine routes. Thus, remarkably, the cGAS/ STING pathway appears to regulate inflammatory disorders manifested through detection of self-DNA during DNA damage and cellular senescence. The cGAS/STING pathway may not only be important for recognition of DNA virus infection, but also be critical for the host defense against RNA virus infection. However, the detailed mechanism by which STING controls RNA virus infection remains to be determined. Of note, viruses have evolved an elaborate mechanism for escaping detection by the cGAS/ STING axis or for suppressing activation of that pathway; this escape mechanism includes downstream signal activation of the cGAS/STING axis.",

            "text": "2.2 | Critical role of the cytosolic DNA-sensing innate immune response via the cGAS/STING axis Prior to the consecutive introduction of several DNA sensors (described below), Barber and colleagues introduced STING (also referred to as MITA, MPYS or ERIS), which is encoded by the TMEM173 gene and enables activation of the IFN\u03b2 promoter. STING is a 379 amino acid protein consisting of multiple transmembrane regions; it is localized in the ER and plays an essential role in cytosolic DNA-mediated innate immune responses and responses to DNA-based immunization [23] [24] [25] . Several cytosolic DNA species derived from microbial pathogens can trigger STING-dependent signal activation via either the TBK1-mediated IRF3 axis or IKKsmediated NF-\u03baB axis. In response to being stimulated by a DNA ligand, STING may dynamically translocate from the ER to the perinuclear-Golgi region, and form a signaling complex with kinase TBK1 in order to induce IRF3 activation. STING may also lead to protein degradation via a ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway to terminate signal activation near the perinuclear-Golgi region. It has also been suggested that STING associates with dsDNA directly; however, the physiological relevance such an association remains to be clarified [26] . In a later study, it was found that STING binds directly to CDNs, which are known to be bacterially derived second messenger molecules, with high affinity via formation of dimers [27] . Around the same time, it was also found that genetically engineered mice with a single point mutation in the STING gene (T596A, referred to as Goldenticket) failed to associate with CDNs or produce type I IFN in response to bacterially produced CDNs [28] , suggesting that STING is a direct innate immune sensor for production of CDN-mediated type I IFNs. In addition, several groups have determined the crystal structure of complexes formed by binding between CDNs and STING via the cytoplasmic C-terminal region [29] . Through all these points of enquiry, the discovery of STING should improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cytosolic DNA-mediated innate immune responses; however, a cytosolic DNA sensor located in the region upstream of STING may be identified in the future in a universally accepted manner.",

            "text": "Such a cytosolic DNA sensor may be implicated in generation of an endogenous catalytic enzyme that enables production of CDNs in response to DNA pathogens for production of type I IFNs. In 2013, Chen and colleagues reported a major breakthrough in this line of research. Namely, they discovered cGAMP, a type of CND consisting of different phosphodiester linkages, and its catalytic enzyme (cGAS), which is encoded by MB21D1 or C6orf150 gene [30, 31] . In the cytoplasm, cGAS may bind directly to viral DNA derived from not only several species of DNA viruses, but also from reverse-transcribed DNA that is produced by retroviruses through reverse transcription of the RNA genome. Following binding of DNA, cGAS may induce conformational rearrangement and catalyze synthesis of cGAMP using cellular adenosine triphosphate and guanosine-5\u2032-triphosphate. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that cGAMP may induce STING-dependent signal activation and that this induction would occur via direct association of cGAMP with bacterially-derived CDNs [25] . Details of this signaling transduction via the cGAS/STING axis are summarized in Figure 1 . Of note, the cGAS/STING-mediated signal transduction does not require protein-protein interactions between sensor and adaptor that characterizes pathways of other PRRs (e.g., the TLR, RIG-I-like receptor and inflammasome pathways); rather, it may be mediated by cGAMP or CDNs. Another interesting point is that cGAMP may be transferred from virus-infected cells to neighboring uninfected cells via gap-junction channels, thereby promoting STING activation independently of type I IFN signaling mediated by the IFN-receptor/JAK-STAT axis [32] . This may be considered a novel strategy for rapid conveyance of anti-viral signals in a horizontal manner. Importantly, it has been confirmed that cytosolic DNAmediated innate immune responses and responses to DNAbased immunization play non-redundant roles in mice, including several cGAS-lacking mouse cell types. The cGAS/STING pathway not only plays crucial roles in host defense against DNA pathogens, but also in induction of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases through sensing of self-DNA. Thus, the cGAS/STING pathway must be properly regulated for maintenance of cellular homeostasis and immune responses. However, details of these subjects are beyond the scope of this review; they have been reported extensively elsewhere.",

            "text": "Another DNA sensor candidate gene, IFI16, which is a member of the PYHIN family of proteins, has also been shown to play a role in recognition of synthetic dsDNA and viral DNA derived from viruses that are replicated in the nucleus (e.g., HSV-1, KSHV, human cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus) [33] . Although IFI16 is predominantly expressed in the nucleus in the steady state, it may shuttle between the nucleus and cytosol for sensing of viral DNA [33] . In addition, IFI16 may reportedly be involved in both DNA-sensing inflammasome activation and DNA damage responses in apoptotic cells [34] . Similar to IFI16, a cytosolic DNA sensor AIM2, which may induce IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 rather than type-I IFNs production through the inflammasome pathway after DNA sensing in the cytosol has been proposed [35] [36] [37] . Recently, AIM2-like receptors, of which there are 13 members, all of which possess a pyrinsignaling domain and a DNA-binding HIN domain (e.g., p204, which is seen as a mouse ortholog of human IFI16), have been shown not to contribute to DNA sensing for type-I IFN production or induction of self-DNA-mediated autoimmune diseases such as AGS [38] . However, most recently, the establishment of human IFI16-deficient cells on the basis of macrophages and keratinocytes using CRISPR/Cas9 or a TALEN approach indicates that production of type-I IFNs the cGAS/STING pathway. Upon DNA virus infection, the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS directly recognizes viral DNA and catalyzes cGAMP, which utilizes cellular GTP/adenosine triphosphate, thereby triggering activation of the signal adaptor STING via direct interaction with cGAMP. cGAS may also recognize the transfected dsDNA or viral DNA that is produced by HIV-1 through reverse-transcription of viral RNA. Following the binding of cGAMP, STING is translocated from the ER to perinuclear-Golgi and may form a signaling complex with kinase TBK1 (phosphorylation of STING at Serine[S]-366 occurs here after translocation), thus inducing production of IRF3-mediated type I IFNs. STING may also activate production of NF-\u03baB(p65)-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokines. cGAS may also recognize self-DNAs, such as the released nucleosome and micronuclear DNA in the cytoplasm during DNA damage or cellular senescence, promoting STING-dependent signal activation. Missense mutation of a number of cellular DNases may induce aberrant inflammatory responses via the cGAS/STING axis as a result of failure of self-DNA digestion in necrotic or inappropriately apoptotic cells. P; phosphorylation and ISGs in response to synthetic dsDNA and HSV-1 infection is impaired [39, 40] . Interestingly, these studies also showed that IFI16 is a prerequisite for full-activation of cGAS/STING function; however, in vivo evaluation is needed to fully clarify the physiological relevance of IFI16.",

            "text": "There may be a correlation between the DNA damage response and innate immune responses mediated by virus infection; however, Stetson et al. have reported conflicting findings [20] . Most recently, it has been suggested that several DNA damage-inducible host factors, such as the catalytic subunit of DNA-PKcs, and its binding co-factors Ku70/80, or Mre11, are involved in the cytosolic DNAsensing immune response through direct interaction with DNA ligands [44, 45] . Upon simulation with synthetic DNA ligands or infection with DNA virus, only partial redundancy of ISG expression was observed in DNA-PKcsdeficient murine cells, suggesting a high potential for a cytosolic DNA-sensing innate immune response. However, it is interesting to note that Mre11 may be specifically involved in the response to synthetic dsDNA, but not involved in the response to DNA virus infection or to treatment with DMXAA, which is known as a STING specific agonist. Additionally, these observations indicate that type-I IFNs are produced in response to stimulation with DNA damage-inducing chemical agents (e.g., etoposide or cisplatin) [46] . Recent studies using DNA damage-inducing agents such as 7,12-dimethylbenz-\u03b1-anthracene have suggested that the following pathway underlies the DNA damage-induced immune response via the cytosolic DNAsensing pathway: 7,12-dimethylbenz-\u03b1-anthracene-induced DNA damage results in nucleosome leakage into the cytosol and then elicits cGAS/STING-dependent signal activation via self-DNA recognition [9] . It has been proposed that, in addition to direct sensing of DNA, the indirect machinery of the cytosolic DNA-sensing innate immune response is also involved. The leucine-rich repeat Flightless-interacting protein 1 has been shown to function as an amplifier of cytosolic nucleic acid-sensing immune responses for production of type-I IFNs via the transcriptional co-activator \u03b2-catenin but not via IRF3 activation [47] . Thus, accumulating evidence indicates that various genes function in cytosolic nucleic acid-sensing immune responses in a ligand-specific or cell type-specific manner.",

These results indicate that these distinct kinases, TBK1 and ULK1/2, may possess opposite functions via the same residue S366 for STING phosphorylation. Further studies using genetically engineered mice are needed to resolve these conflicting observations and determine the physiological relevance of ULK1/2. The presence of an additional residue at position S358 of human STING also has the potential to affect STING phosphorylation; however, the impact of this phosphorylation remains to be clarified [50] . Most recently, it was shown that ribosomal protein S6K1 may also participate in the positive regulation of STINGdependent signal activation; however, the kinase activity of S6K1 has been found to be dispensable [51] . In contrast to the observation of STING-mediated phosphorylation, only one intracellular kinase that is involved in modulation of cGAS function has been reported. A DNA virus (like HSV-1)inducible Akt (also referred to as protein kinase B) may be involved in phosphorylation of cGAS at S305 (at S291 in murine cGAS) within the enzymatic domain of cGAS, thereby suppressing the enzymatic activity of cGAS [52] . This may be one of the strategies by which HSV-1 escapes the DNA-sensing immune response and achieves sustained infection. Further studies are needed to determine whether there is an intracellular phosphorylation kinase that can positively regulate cGAS function.",

First, it has been proposed that several members of the TRIM family of RING E3 ligases, such as TRIM56 and TRIM32, play a role in STING ubiquitination via conjugation of K63linked poly-ubiquitination in a manner that positively impacts STING function [53, 54] . Conversely, in addition to TRIM29 and TRIM30\u03b1, E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF5 may induce degradation of STING via conjugation of K48-linked polyubiquitination for termination of signal activation [55] [56] [57] . Additionally, each of two distinct molecules-the AMFRinsulin-induced gene 1 (GP78/INSIG1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1have also been shown to be involved in STING ubiquitination via conjugation of K27-and K63-linked poly-ubiquitination, respectively, to facilitate STING-dependent signal activation [58, 59] . Most recently, it has been reported that RNF26 may catalyze STING ubiquitination via conjugation of K11linked poly-ubiquitination at the same conjugating site of RNF5. This may be considered to contribute positively to STING function through competition with RNF5-mediated This table summarizes the various kinases, phosphatase, ubiquitin ligases and de-ubiquitin ligases that modulate cGAS/STING-dependent signal activation.

            "text": "Members of the herpesvirus family are widely used as ligands for induction of DNA-mediated immune responses both in vitro and in vivo and there is accumulated evidence that these viruses have antagonistic effects on the cGAS/ STING pathway. The HSV-1-encoded tegument protein UL41 has been shown to induce cGAS degradation via the proteasomal pathway; additionally, HSV-1 immediate early protein ICP0 may affect the stability and function of STING in certain cell types [71, 72] . Other tegument proteins such as UL46 reportedly interfere with the function of cGAMPmediated STING by physically interacting with STING and its downstream kinase TBK1 [73] . HSV-1 ICP27, an immediate early protein that is conserved in all herpesviruses, may also interact with STING and TBK1, thus interfering with STING-dependent signal activation [74] . HSV-1 VP22, which is encoded by the UL49 gene, may also possess an antagonistic function against the cytosolic DNA-sensing immune response through modulation of the enzymatic activity of cGAS [75] . Deamidation impairs the ability of cGAS to catalyze cGAMP synthesis; additionally, it has been shown that HSV-1 UL37 tegument protein may promote cGAS deamidation, thus attenuating cGAMP-mediated anti-viral activity [76] . Recent studies have demonstrated that HSV-1 may target transcription factors that are located downstream of the STING/TBK1 axis as part of its immune evasion strategy. In addition to the viral serine protease of HSV-1, VP24, some viral tegument proteins, such as UL24 and UL36, have evolved certain strategies to target IRF3 and NF-\u03baB by negatively regulating them [77] [78] [79] . Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that the \u03b334.5 gene of HSV-1 encodes a virulence factor for HSV-1mediated pathogenesis that may also act as an antagonistic factor against the cGAS/STING pathway [80] , which is consistent with the finding that an HSV-1 mutant in which the \u03b334.5 gene has been deleted no longer exhibits an antagonistic function in infected cells, thereby facilitating IFN production in a STING-dependent manner [26] . On the other hand, an oncogenic herpesvirus, KHSV, which encodes viral interferon regulatory factor 1 gene, has been shown to prevent an association between STING and TBK1, thereby inhibiting initiation of IRF3-mediated signal activation [81] . The authors of this paper also identified five other KSHV-encoded proteins that can suppress STING-dependent signal activation. The LANA of KSHV has been shown to play a pivotal role in viral replication. Zhang and colleagues have also reported that N-terminal truncated cytoplasmic isoforms of LANA may associate with cGAS directly, thus interfering with cGAS-dependent signal activation [82] . Moreover, MHV68 encoding DUB enzyme ORF64 (also referred to as a KSHV ORF52 homolog) has also been shown to suppress STING-dependent signal activation [83] . The mechanism responsible for this involves a DNA-sensing process in a DUB activity-dependent manner. Additionally, a KSHV-encoded tegument protein, ORF52, has also been shown to antagonize cGAS function through its direct association with both cGAS and viral DNA [84] . Furthermore, the authors of this paper showed that, in addition to MHV68, the homologs of ORF52 genes derived from Epstein-Barr virus and Rhesus monkey rhadinovirus exhibit similar inhibitory functions targeting cGAS, suggesting that the antagonistic function of gamma herpesviruses is evolutionally conserved. Overall, these results indicated that herpesviruses may modulate the cytosolic DNA-mediated immune response via an elaborate mechanism that involves viral encoding of several antagonistic genes. Moreover, a viral oncoprotein containing the LXCXE motif, which is also conserved among a small number of DNA tumor viruses, was recently shown to suppress the cytosolic DNA-sensing immune response. For instance, viral encoding oncoproteins such as E7 and E1A derived from human papillomavirus 18 and human adenovirus type-5 suppress the cytosolic DNA-sensing immune response through direct association with STING [85] . Interestingly, it has been shown that LXCXE-containing tumor proteins are also expressed in many types of immortalized cells and permanently impair the cytosolic DNA-sensing immune response via cGAS/STING. This may be a component of the cytotoxic mechanism of the viral oncoprotein that exhibits LXCXE-mediated antagonism of the STING pathway.",

Some RNA viruses that encode viral proteases (e.g., hepatitis A virus 3C protease, enterovirus 71 2A protease, rhinovirus 2A and 3C protease and coxsackievirus (23) . (b) Enveloped RNA viruses such as IAV, NDV and Sendai virus activate IFN production through a viral envelope-mediated fusion process in a STING-dependent but cGASindependent manner; however, the molecular mechanism of signal transduction is yet to be clarified (97) . As shown in Figure 2 , the hemagglutinin fusion peptide of IAV may also associate with STING via its dimerization interphase domain, thereby inhibiting STINGdependent signal activation. Abbreviations: FP, fusion peptide B3 3C protease) can directly cleave IPS-1 by means of this strategy [88] . With regard to the cGAS/STING pathway, NS2B/NS3 protease of DENV was initially found to have a similar inhibitory evasion mechanism via proteolysis of human, but not murine, STING [89, 90] , which is consistent with the observation that DENV replication is restricted in mice because DENV protease cannot cleave murine STING. Most recently, this conserved strategy for cleaving STING was also observed in other flavivirus NS2B/NS3 proteases derived from Zika virus, West Nile virus and JEV, but not YFV [91] . Accordingly, there may be a non-proteolytic mechanism for counteracting STING function by YFVencoded viral protease, as described above. It has also been proposed that the Zika virus may possess an alternative strategy for immune escape. Zika virus-encoded NS1 protein has been shown to promote proteolysis of cGAS rather than STING through recruitment of caspase-1 activation, suggesting that Zika virus infection manipulates the interplay between the inflammasome and cGAS/STING pathways [92] . These results indicate that the Flaviviridae family has evolved the mechanism of targeting distinct signal adaptor molecules of cytosolic nucleic acid sensors to escape from innate immune responses in humans.",

Thus, an improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying overactivity of inflammation mediated via the cGAS/STING pathway could lead to design of potent therapeutic agents and strategies for overcoming undesirable inflammatory diseases and certain types of cancer. In addition, although the cGAS/STING pathway may contribute to detection and elimination of infection by both DNA and RNA viruses, over time these viruses have also evolved the ability to escape or manipulate this signal activation through several evasion strategies, as described above. Indeed, such manipulation is considered critical to the ability of viruses to establish both lytic and persistent infection and elicit characteristic pathogenesis. Further information on the non-canonical mechanism of cGAS-independent STING activation and the evasion strategies of RNA viruses will strongly facilitate understanding of the host-pathogen interaction. The cGAS/STING pathway may function in a variety of cell types; however, details of the mechanisms by which hepatotropic viruses achieve persistent infection of hepatocytes have yet to be elucidated. Similarly, an understanding of virus-mediated immune evasion strategies could provide novel insights into viral evolution and the potential design of novel anti-viral agents. Finally, along with the accumulating insights regarding the cGAS/STING pathway and its involvement in virus-host interactions, it is also important to better understand the loss of cGAS/STING function in some types of cancer or transformed cells by viral encoding oncoprotein. This loss may involve signal manipulation via epigenetic silencing and insertion of missense mutations into the cGAS/ STING locus. Further elucidation of this point may provide important information for the treatment of several viral oncogeneses.",

Upon DENV infection in DCs, RIG-I directly recognizes viral RNA and activates IFN production through interaction with mitochondrial adaptor IPS-1. DENV infection also triggers a mitochondrial damage response via induction of reactive oxygen species, resulting in mitochondrial DNA release in the cytoplasm that in turn stimulates signal activation via the cGAS/STING axis.
