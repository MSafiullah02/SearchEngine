How specific pandemic-related factors impact maternal, infant, , child, and adolescent mental health, and how these factors interact with previously known and existing risk factors to amplify risk and/or resilience.\u2022\nMeasurement. Development and validation of new measures that capture variation in the impacts of COVID 19 on family/individual functioning and other factors with specific relevance to pediatric mental health.\u2022\nNeuroscience, Genetics and Epigenetics. Ongoing neuroimaging studies that have been interrupted by the pandemic may be able to assess differences as a result of changes to stop the spread of the virus (i.e., isolation, social distancing and changes in peer interactions, increased screen time, etc.). Epigenetic studies that have pre-COVID samples may be able to resample after COVID exposure or after exposure to the stress of social isolation. Genetic studies, that are adequately powered, may explore vulnerabilities and resilience at the level of genetic variation.\u2022\nBiomarkers. Biomarker identification and/or testing of biomarkers that capture the multi-faceted impact of COVID 19 on children and adolescents as they relate to mental illness and/or resilience.\u2022\nPrevention, Treatment, and Service System Response. The role of any preemptive prevention strategies and their impact. Guidance on how to address the challenges of managing patients given the restrictions reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic. At-risk groups, including immigrants, youth in juvenile detention, newborns, homeless youth, children with chronic illnesses, and other groups differentially impacted by health and socioeconomic disparities, are particularly important in this regard. Multi-site investigations of the rapid expansion of developing paradigms to respond to the crisis that include standardized protocols and outcomes along with investigations into new gaps that were produced by this pandemic.\n",
