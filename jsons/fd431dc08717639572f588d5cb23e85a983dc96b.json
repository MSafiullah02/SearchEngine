This pattern suggests that L has a higher transmission rate than the S type.\" The abstract of the paper goes even further, stating outright that: \"the S type, which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive\u2026\". It is, however, important to appreciate that finding a majority of samples with a particular mutation is not evidence that viruses with that mutation transmit more readily. To make this suggestion would, at the very minimum, require a comparison to be made to expectations under a null distribution assuming equal transmission rates. As this has not been performed by the authors, there is insufficient evidence to make this suggestion, and therefore it is incorrect (and, we would argue, irresponsible) to state that there is any difference in transmission rates. Genome sequence analysis alone is insufficient to demonstrate a functional effect of a mutation on virus phenotype, without assessing the probable impact of the amino acid replacement, and careful experimentation assessing any functional effect. Differences in the observed numbers of samples with and without this mutation are far more likely to be due to stochastic epidemiological effects and biased virus genome sampling among locations.",

In a viral outbreak, each transmission event from one infected person to another is a random probabilistic event, with some infected individuals transmitting more or less often than others. Some infections may transmit at higher rates than others for a variety of reasons. These \"super spreaders\" may have higher social contact rates or shed more virus for a longer period of time. These small-scale epidemiological phenomena add up over time to create substantial variation in the frequencies of mutations during an outbreak. It is also important to appreciate that the fewer infected hosts there are, the more these small scale variations are likely to affect the frequency of mutations in the viral population. Given that the two mutations in question appear to have occurred very early on in the outbreak, when fewer individuals were infected, their frequency will very likely have been particularly influenced by genetic drift.",

In the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the sampling bias arises in two ways. First of all, the sampling of infections for sequencing is greatly biased by the country they occur in. For example, 80% of confirmed COVID-19 cases up until 9/3/2020 came from China, but only 40% of the SARS-CoV-2 full genome sequences derived from China. Second, as contact tracing is a significant driver of case detection, there will be a correlation between detected and sequenced samples, as they are often epidemiologically linked. This lack of independence between sampled genomes, in effect generates pseudoreplication of observed haplotypes. These factors combine to cause oversampling of particular genotypes and mutations, adding variance to the observed frequencies of mutations. This is likely to further exaggerate the variation in mutation frequencies driven by epidemiology, causing observed changes in mutation frequencies through time without any action of natural selection.",

            "text": "Examples from two previous viral outbreaks demonstrate these factors. A small number of mutations were observed to rise to high frequencies in both the Ebola and SARS-CoV-1 outbreaks. For both viruses, clearly demonstrating a functional effect of the mutations proved difficult, with some counterintuitive observations. The A82V amino acid replacement in the GP protein from the 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak illustrates the difficulty in demonstrating a functional effect of a mutation. Three new amino acid replacements in the Ebola outbreak rose in frequency to be found in more than 90% of all sequenced genomes: R111C in the NP gene, A82V in the GP gene, and D759G in the L gene. The A82V replacement was of particular interest as it was located on the receptor binding interface. However, this rise in frequency alone was insufficient to make firm conclusions about the functional significance of this mutation. To demonstrate the significance of the A82V replacement, Diehl et al. (2016) performed numerous additional analyses. These included: predicting the structural impact of the change on the protein in silico; modelling the effect of the mutation on case fatality rate, controlling for viral loads, geographic location and access to healthcare; and in vitro experimental infection of three different human, and nine different non-human cell lines using viruses with and without this mutation. Despite finding significant evidence that virus infections with the A82V replacement showed higher mortality rates, and that the mutation enhanced infectivity of human and primate cell lines, the authors were not able to conclude that this mutation contributed to greater transmission and severity of the outbreak: \"It is difficult to draw any conclusion about this hypothesis, though, since the frequency increase can also be attributed to stochastic effects, including founder effects as EBOV moved from Guinea into Sierra Leone and multiple re-introductions of GP-A82V back into Guinea.\"",

This mutation caused the splitting of ORF8 into two ORFs: ORF8a and ORF8b. It was hypothesized that this deletion was either neutral, with ORF8 being functionally unimportant (Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium 2004), or that that it was adaptive, facilitating the spread of SARS-CoV1 in humans (e.g., Chen et al. 2007; Wong et al. 2018 ). However, experimental infection of one bat and two human cell lines showed that the 29 nucleotide deletion significantly reduced the replicative capability of SARS-CoV1 (Muth et al. 2018) . Additionally, deletion of the full ORF8 gene caused an even greater reduction in replicative capability. The spread of this apparently strongly deleterious mutation was hypothesised to be the result of a founder effect in the early period of the epidemic (Muth et al. 2018) .",

This is because new synonymous substitutions in the outbreak are much more likely to mutate back to this deeper ancestral state in the tree than new nonsynonymous substitutions.

This possibility is important because sequencing errors will be at low frequency as they are rare and cannot be transmitted, but real mutations can be at any frequency because they can be transmitted. Additionally, purifying selection can only act on real mutations, and not sequencing errors, so strongly deleterious/lethal nonsynonymous substitutions which cannot be observed as real mutations may appear as sequencing errors. Therefore it is very possible that sequencing error mutations will have a higher nonsynonymous to synonymous ratio, and these mutations will be at low frequency.

Recent work has shown that false positive rates of positive selection inference are unacceptably high when such synonymous rate variation occurs (Wisotsky et al. 2020) . Therefore, if there truly is synonymous rate variation, to reliably identify signatures of positive selection within the phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2, methods which model mutation rate variation must be used (e.g., provided by many of the models from the Hyphy package-Pond and Mute 2005).",
