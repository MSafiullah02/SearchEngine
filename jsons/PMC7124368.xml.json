It is referred to as a novel coronavirus because it has not been observed previously in humans. Its likely reservoir is bats, with pangolins identified as the likely intermediate host [9]. It is worth mentioning that pangolins are endangered and the most trafficked animal in the world [10]. As the pangolin trade is illegal, this would explain why they were not listed in the official registers of the Wuhan market, making it difficult for researchers to identify the source of the virus. Some researchers are suggesting that the virus may have been circulating previously, and the market may have been an amplification setting rather than the source of the spillover [11].",

As our climate changes, certain populations of animals (especially mosquitos or other animals that function as disease vectors) increase and spread into geographic zones that were previously uninhabitable to them, and they are more likely to spread the diseases that they carry to new regions. Changes in land use and changes in human/animal contact also affect the emergence/re-emergence and spread of disease, as does the unmanageable explosion of the global wildlife trade. Legal and illegal wildlife trade is estimated to affect one in four mammal and bird species globally, and to generate between US$7.8 and US$10 billion annually [13,14]. In response to COVID-19, China placed a temporary ban on wildlife trade on 26th January 2020 [15]. Although this will likely only affect the legal wildlife trade (temporarily), it is a step in the right direction.",

The \u2018monoculture effect\u2019 is well known in agriculture, but there is mounting evidence that it is also important in animal farming [16,17]. Although the aforementioned studies look at wild animal populations, there is a high indication that it holds true for animals raised for food. Often large populations of specific species of animals raised for food are kept in suboptimal conditions. Without even mentioning the inherent issues of waste management and animal welfare, industrial farming also creates health risks for humans in multiple ways if these populations are not isolated from wild animals of similar species. In the case of avian influenza, the virus, which circulates naturally in wild bird populations, came into contact with large homogeneous populations of birds in poultry farms [18].",

Both avian and swine influenza continue to be managed through regular vaccination of livestock [19]. Although the main reason for antibiotic use in farming is to preserve human and animal health and prevent zoonoses, widespread use of antibiotics in terrestrial animal production (including first-line antibiotics such as colistin) promotes antibiotic resistance [20,21]. In farming, antibiotics are used as prophylactics to make up for crowded unhealthy conditions, and growth promoters as well as therapeutic treatments for specific disease outbreaks. Therefore, although they are relevant tools for decreasing zoonoses, antibiotic use in animals can also become the catalyst for the development of zoonoses that are resistant to antibiotics [22].",

In that sense, the timing of COVID-19 was very bad luck. Chinese New Year is the biggest mass migration in the world, with 385 million people making approximately 3 billion trips during the holiday period [30,31]. The fact that the outbreak happened during this time makes it that much more difficult to trace and control, and certainly influences the speed at which it is spreading. In a globalized world, the security of countries is interdependent, and in the case of a severe global pandemic, the world is (arguably) only as prepared as its weakest country [32].",

Health systems are varied. A small outbreak of influenza in a high-resource country with a robust health system will likely only have a small impact on the continual habitual or average delivery of health services that have nothing to do with the outbreak. A health system that is fragile, or already overloaded by either routine care or another emergency, needs only a little disruption to damage it or even cause it to collapse. Traditionally, supranational organizations, international institutions and non-governmental organizations will fill that response vacuum as well as is possible. An example of this and how difficult it is to implement effectively would be the international response to the 2014 Ebola epidemic [35,36].",

As SARS-CoV-2 has not been seen before in humans, the population is completely na\u00efve. The virus has also been shown to have high interhuman transmission. Sufficient data are not yet available for exact figures concerning the spread, but there have been initial estimates that each infected person would infect, on average, 2.6 other people (uncertainty range 1.5\u20133.5) [38]. WHO estimates are a little less daunting, reporting a preliminary reproductive number (R\n0) estimate of 1.4\u20132.5 [39]. Importantly, calculations from Imperial College London estimate that infection control measures need to block well over 60% of transmissions to be effective in controlling the outbreak [38]. That number is most likely inaccurate, but this will be easier to assess as time goes on. In the case that the virus can be transmitted by an asymptomatic individual [40], it will be even more difficult to implement a 60% effective infection and control (IPC) strategy, especially because most of the people infected will be in the community and not in healthcare settings. However, the initial report of asymptomatic transmission in Germany was inaccurate, which is encouraging [41]. A further challenge is posed by the decision of foreign governments to evacuate and repatriate their citizens from China. The inevitable quarantines and infection control measures that need to be taken as people arrive back in their home countries will be crucial for preventing the spread of the virus [42]. The Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Japan, with more than 691 infected people and four deaths (as of 25th February 2020), is an example of inadequate IPC in the community that led to a disaster [[43], [44], [45]].",

It is difficult to tell what the actual mortality of the virus is, as the current death toll includes all-cause mortality of infected people and is likely overestimated by the testing of mostly sicker patients, although this information will emerge over time. SARS-CoV-2 seems to be spread mainly by droplets and not through air. Nosocomial transmission has been described [49], and superspreading events in hospital settings may occur. SARS-CoV-2 is possibly spreading indirectly through contaminated surfaces and hand contamination as well, but the lack of aerosol transmission will make the spread less efficient. According to WHO, 25% of current cases are considered severe [39], but this proportion would presumably decrease while more patients and contacts would have been searched for and screened. The reason for this is that most of the cases screened are for relatively severe infections, especially in areas where tests are limited. Once more people are screened (including milder cases), the percentage of severe cases (and the death rate) will inevitable drop and get closer to its true value.",

Granted, we do not know what, if any, long-term effects this virus might have on the human body. But what is most important is to keep a healthy perspective and avoid getting distracted by all of the hype and forecasting. Although sufficient information is not yet available, SARS-CoV-2 may be less deadly than the influenza virus that hospitals deal with on an annual basis, and transmission seems to occur mainly through droplets. Even a high estimate of the R\n0 rate is many times lower than for airborne diseases such as measles, for instance [54]. It is important to remember that the R\n0 rate refers to the average transmissibility of the disease, and does not give information on how fast it will spread. Seasonal influenza has an R\n0 of approximately 1.3, but circulates through the whole human population every year [55]. Human immunodeficiency virus, on the other hand, spreads far more slowly through the population, yet has a highly variable reproductive rate [56]. Still, SARS-CoV-2 causes pneumonia in healthy people [57], even if most of the deaths are described in elderly, comorbid patients. More epidemiological data are needed in order to determine the full spectrum of the disease.",

This has a similar reproductive rate to estimates of the R\n0 of SARS-CoV-2, but only infected approximately 8000 people. In the early phase of the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak, the lack or inappropriateness of IPC measures used proved to be associated with increased risk for cross-transmission and within-hospital spread of the disease among both visitors and healthcare staff [[58], [59], [60]]. In contrast, when applied appropriately, IPC measures were extremely effective during the SARS epidemic [61]. Similarly, IPC measures will certainly prove to be extremely effective in respect to SARS-CoV-2, but more detailed transmission models are needed [62]. In a 2003 analysis of SARS in Hong Kong that excluded superspreading events, the reproductive rate dropped from 2.9 during the initial phase of the epidemic to 0.4 after the implementation of IPC measures [63]. Usually, once the reproductive rate falls below 1, the outbreak will die out on its own. Therefore, having a strong and adapted IPC response to this outbreak will be crucial to stopping it. An additional factor is that people infected by SARS-CoV felt unwell and were likely to seek care in hospitals. SARS-CoV-2 seems to cause a wider range of symptoms, and if people only show mild infections, the infection may go unnoticed (with people thinking that they have a common cold). This can cause the disease to be underdiagnosed, which means that people will be more likely to continue to spread the virus.",

            "text": "After some debate, WHO declared SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on 30th January 2020. The process leading up to this decision is complex and impacts many people; on the one hand, such a declaration is an international call for alarm, but on the other hand, it does not guarantee that the outbreak will be ended or the exact nature of the international response [82]. WHO initially declined to label the coronavirus outbreak as a PHEIC, as doing so would be extremely disruptive. The member views concerning this decision were quite divided during the first meeting, but WHO agreed to re-assess this decision in a few days' time [39], and changed its global risk assessment for SARS-CoV-2 from \u2018moderate\u2019 to \u2018high\u2019 [83]. It maintains that there is no evidence that donors withhold disaster relief funds if a PHEIC is not declared [84]. It is worth noting that WHO repeatedly declined to label the 2018 Ebola outbreak as a PHEIC, showing that there is a tendency to err on the side of caution [85]. When it did so in 2019, there was prevailing opinion that the PHEIC designation would be game changing in terms of resources allocated and international response [86]. We predict that the PHEIC designation for SARS-CoV-2 will help to mobilize the response on a global scale.",

Coupled with the exponential growth of the pandemic, the very short pre- or pauci-symptomatic and infectious incubation period of the virus, as well as the possible prolonged high-level carriage, makes it quite difficult to contain [40]. One probable scenario is that SARS-CoV-2 will just become another human virus that the world deals with on a regular basis. WHO Director-General Dr Tedros warned of a potential global pandemic: \u2018The window of opportunity is still there, but our window of opportunity is narrowing\u2019, he said on 21st February 2020. \u2018We need to act quickly before it closes completely\u2019 [95].
