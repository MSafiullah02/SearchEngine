            "text": "Ranging from biological systems to economic and social systems, many real-world complex systems can be represented by networks, including chemical-reaction networks, neuronal networks, food webs, telephone networks, the World Wide Web, railroad and airline routes, social networks and scientific-collaboration networks [1], [2], [3]. Obviously, real networks are neither regular lattices nor simple random networks. Since the small-world network model [4] and the scale-free network model [5] were put forward at the end of the last century, people have found that many real complex networks are actually associated with the small-world property and a scale-free, power-law degree distribution. In the past ten years, the theory of complex networks has drawn continuous attention from diverse scientific communities, such as network modelling [6], [7], [8], synchronization [9], [10], information traffic [11], [12], [13], [14], epidemic spreading [15], [16], cascading failures [17], [18], [19], [20], evolutionary games [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], social dynamics [26] etc. One interesting and important research direction is understanding transportation infrastructures in the framework of complex network theory [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34].",

            "text": "With the acceleration of the globalization process, the aviation industry plays a more and more critical role in the economy and many scientists have paid special attention to the airline transportation infrastructure. Complex network theory is naturally a useful tool since the airports can be denoted by vertices and the flights can be denoted by edges. In the past few years, some interesting research has been reported studying airport networks from the point of view of network theory. For example, Amaral et al. and Guimer\u00e0 et al. comprehensively investigated the worldwide airport network (WAN) [35], [36]. They found that WAN is a typical scale-free small-world network and the most connected nodes in WAN are not necessarily the most central nodes, which means critical locations might not coincide with highly-connected hubs in the infrastructures. This interesting phenomenon inspired them to propose a geographical\u2013political-constrained network model. Barrat et al. and Colizza et al. further investigated the intensity of WAN\u2019s connections in the view of weighted networks and found correlations between weighted quantities and topology [37], [38]. They proposed a weighted evolving network model to expand our understanding of the weighted features of real systems. Furthermore, they proposed a global epidemic model to study the role of WAN in the prediction and predictability of global epidemics. Also, several empirical works on the Chinese Airport Network [39], [40], [41] and the Indian Airport Network [42] reveal that the scale of national airport networks can exhibit different properties from the global scale of WAN, i.e., the two-regime power-law degree distribution and the disassortative mixing property.",

Recently, Gautreau et al. studied the US airport network in the time period 1990\u20132000. They found that most statistical indicators are stationary and that intense activity takes place at the microscopic level, with many disappearing/appearing links between airports [43]. Rocha studied the Brazilian airport network (BAN) in the time period 1995\u20132006. He also found the network structure is dynamic, with changes in the importance of airports and airlines, and the traffic on BAN has doubled during a period in which the topology of BAN has shrunk [44]. Inspired by their interesting work, we investigate the evolution of Chinese Airport Network (CAN) from the year 1950 to 2008 (1991\u20132008 for detailed traffic information and 2002\u20132009 for detailed topology information). It is found that the airway traffic volume increased in an exponential form while the topology had no significant change.",

Since the aviation industry is closely related to economic development, we firstly investigate the development of the Chinese economy, airports and flights. Fig. 1\n(a) shows the development of Chinese GDP from 1950 to 2008. One can see that it has greatly increased in those 58 years. However, the development of airlines (Fig. 1(b)) and airports (Fig. 1(c)) is not consistent with that of GDP. For the development of airports (Fig. 1(c)), one can see that the number of airports grew in 1950\u20131975, 1987\u20131995 and 2005\u20132008, but stayed constant in 1975\u20131987 and 1995\u20132005. The first increase (1950\u20131975) mainly connected large prefecture-level cities, and the second increase (1987\u20131995) mainly connected medium prefecture-level cities. The third increase (2005\u20132008) is due to the rapid development of the Chinese economy and China plans to build more airports by 2020. From Fig. 1(b), one can also see that the number of airlines has remained constant since 1995 and rose again in year 2007 and 2008.",

Moreover, the Chinese aviation industry was also shocked by the 2008 global financial crisis. The top 3 Chinese airline companies have reported their operating information for 2008 and the most important indicators are declining. This has been demonstrated by the annual report of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) and we can find in Fig. 2 that the traffic for 2008 is almost the same as that of 2007.",

Fig. 3(a) shows the degree distribution P(k) of CAN, which follows a two-regime power-law distribution with two different exponents as in Refs. [39], [40], [41] (i.e., for small degrees, P(k)\u221dk\u03bb1 and \u03bb1=\u22120.49; and for large degrees, P(k)\u221dk\u03bb2 and \u03bb2=\u22122.63). We also investigated the directed CAN and it is found that P(kin) and P(kout) are almost the same as P(k), where kin is the ingoing degree and kout is the outgoing degree. Fig. 1(b) shows the correlation between kin and kout. One can see that the in-out degree correlation is very strong: the slope is 1.000421. This means that one can fly from one airport to another and return using the same airline. Another important topological property is the degree\u2013degree correlation. It is defined as the mean degree of the neighbors (knn, which is closely related to the network modularity [46]) of a given airport. Fig. 3(c) shows the results of degree\u2013degree correlation of undirected CAN and we can find that the degrees of adjacent airports have significant linear anti-correlation. Fig. 3(d) exhibits the relationship of clustering coefficient C and degree k. As it shows, lower degree nodes have larger clustering coefficient. All the results above are well in accordance with the results reported by Li and Cai [39], Liu and Zhou [40] and Liu et al. [41].",

The three nodes are all located in west China: Kunming is the central city of the southwest, Xi\u2019an is the central city of the northwest and Urumqi is the central city of the far northwest. The western population needs to be connected to the political centers (e.g., Beijing) and economic centers (e.g. Shanghai and Shenzhen) in the east. However, due to the long distance from western China to eastern China (over 3000 km), it is costly and unnecessary to make all western airports directly link to the eastern airports. Thus some transit airports are naturally formed as the bridge between east and west China.",

Fig. 6\nshows the measured fluctuation of CAN from year 2002 to 2009. Fig. 6(a) shows the fluctuation of airports and we can see that the fluctuation (including the added airports and removed airports) is usually between 5 and 15. But for the second half year of 2007 and the first half year of 2008, the fluctuation is evidently more vigorous. Fig. 6(b) shows that the percentage of changed airlines is usually smaller than 20% and the majority of changes is mainly induced by aOO and dOO. But for the second half year of 2007 and the first year of 2008, when many airports were added and removed, aON and dOR contribute the majority of changes.",

It is found that the average traffic of CAN has increased about 200% during the 17 years. It is worth noting that there exists a sudden drop of passenger traffic in year 2003 (see Figs. 7(b), 8(a) and (b)). This was mainly caused by the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). However, the cargo traffic was not affected by SARS (see Figs. 7(a), 8(c) and (d)).",

For municipalities Beijing (Fig. 10(b)) and Shanghai (Fig. 10(c)), the slopes are obviously smaller. Because Beijing and Shanghai are the most important central cities of politics, economy and culture in China, they are aggregating centers and distributing centers for over 51% of Chinese goods flow (only 27% of Chinese passenger flow).
