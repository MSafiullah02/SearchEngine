PTX3 is produced by a variety of cells, located almost everywhere (e.g. dendritic cells), while CRP is produced only by the liver. PTX3 plays a key role in the activation and the amplification of inflammation. ALI/ARDS is characterized by an important inflammatory reaction, often both local and systemic.",

Candida Albicans was the most common type of Candida specie isolated. The total mortality observed in the ICU during the study period was 30.3%. Associated mortality due to Candida spp was 55.9% in contrast with 25% of mortality from patients without Candida spp. The mortality rate of patients with IVC was 85.7% versus 46.66% from patients with non IVC, a relative risk for mortality of 2 (0.14-0.40). All patients with IVC, except two, received antifungical treatment. Two patients survive to the ICU. Mortality directly attributable to candidemia was observed in one patient.",

We found following correlations: The initial S100B protein level is very important for the prognosis especially the initial level above 1 microg/L, but it is necessary to evaluate the S100B 0h/S100B 72h ratio. Rapid decrease of the levels in the first 72 hours to normal value is associated with a good prognosis. The initial level can be relatively high, but the S100B 0h/S100B 72 h ratio must decreased minimally by 300%. Persistent high levels in the first 24 hours and decrease of the level after this time period is associated with good prognosis too, but the result is depended on the initial level more, because the S100B 0h/S100B 72h ratio is worse. Repeated increase of the S100B protein levels after previous decrease is associated with poor outcome in GOS and KPS.

CONCLUSION. The cause of death was both hypoxic hipoxia (O2 consumption in ignition) and histotoxic hypoxia (CN-). Cyanide inhibits mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase creating multiorganic tissular hypoxia. From 10 to 46% of death in fires are because of CN-. Hydroxicobalamin is the best terapeutical option, based on risk/benefit, if used as soon as possible.

This is the first analysis of changes in rates of diagnostic errors over time in an intensive care unit. The study shows a reduction in important Goldman type I diagnostic discrepancies in intensive care patients who underwent a post mortem examination in the period 2001-2005 compared with the preceding five years. There may be several reasons for this reduction. Our unit has doubled the number of consultant intensivists from two to four. In addition, patients are now managed by multidisciplinary teams. Increased use of diagnostic radiology may have played a role. We plan to increase our use of post mortem examination to further audit diagnostic performance, and to further examine the reasons for the apparent improvement in diagnostic accuracy. [1] . The ultimate goal is to improve the quality of care in Dutch ICU's. Quality of care is defined in several domains which are all covered by our comprehensive set of indicators.

In the particular setting of NP occurring in non-mechanically ventilated patients, there is no consensus regarding the best diagnostic strategy. When mechanical ventilation (MV) becomes mandatory because of NP-related respiratory distress, tracheal aspiration (TA) performed immediately after intubation of the trachea could be thought of as a simple, fast and cheap way to identify the microorganisms involved and achieve early adequate antibiotic therapy.

We conclude that serial standard thromboelastography and HVG viscoelastic test may reveal the independent contribution of platelets and procoagulatory proteins to clot strength. Using multiple linear regression, all coagulation, TEG and HVG variabities were used to model postoperative hypercoagulation. Results showed that some components of the TEG failed to identify hypercoagulation (r < 0, 2, P > 0, 75). However, three components of the routine coagulation assay, including bleeding time, prothrombin time, and platelet count could be modeled to show prolonged postoperative hypercoagulability (P < 0, 01). We conclude that all components of the HVG test reflect postoperative coagulopaties, these results suggests that it may be usefull in determining the coagulation status of cancer patients perioperatively.",

Repsective values of monocyte expression were 22.58+/-2.41 and 49.02 +/-5.81(p 0.08). The area under the curve of the ROC was 0.85 (p<0.001). For a cut-off value of 59% the sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratio of a positive test was 0.79, 0.83 and 4.73 respectively. CONCLUSION. Neutrophil TREM-1 expression is a reliable marker of bacterial infection in patients with respiratory tract infections even if not in a critical condition and can be helpful in decisions regarding antimicrobial treatment or further diagnostic management.0170 DYNAMICS OF C-REACTIVE PROTEIN IN CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS WITH NOSO-COMIAL BLOODSTREAM INFECTIONS Vandijck D M 1 , Blot S I 1 , Benoit D D 1 , De Waele J J 1 , Decruyenaere J M 1 1 Intensive Care Medicine, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium",

The mean time required for partial pressure of arterial oxygen equilibration during mechanical ventilation after a step change in fractional inspired oxygen concentration. oxygenation equilibration time, defined as the time required reaching the final equilibrated PaO2 (1+/-0.1), was calculated. All variables were tested for normality (K-S test). Student's t-test & Mann-Whitney U test were performed where appropriate, and P<.05 was considered statistically significant. Data are expressed as mean+/-SD.RESULTS.The mean equilibration time for rises in PaO2 was 6.89+/-4.64 min for all pts, 6.9+/-4.25 min for the pts with PaO2/FiO2<200 & 6.88+/-5.30 min for the pts with PaO2/FiO2>200. The mean equilibration time for falls in PaO2 was 4.58+/-2.32 min for all pts, 4.8+/-2.53 min for the pts with PaO2/FiO2<200 & 4.33+/-2.18 min for the pts with PaO2/FiO2>200.

In this study, we prospectively analyzed the prognostic value of EVLW in critically ill mechanically ventilated (MV) patients.METHODS.Prospective single center study. So far data analyzed from 97 (59 male) critically ill MV patients treated in 2 ICU's during a 12 month period. Age 64.2\u00b115.4 (28 to 89 years); body mass index 25.7\u00b15.6; SAPS II 50.5\u00b117.6; APACHE II 22\u00b111; SOFA 11\u00b13.8 with 2.4\u00b11.1 organ failures; maximal abdominal pressure (IAP) was 15\u00b14.5. The capillary leak index (CLI) was defined by the CRP over albumin ratio. All patients were hemodynamically monitored by the transpulmonary thermodilution technique. EVLW was calculated using the commercially available PiCCO computer system (Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, Germany). For each measurement, 20 mL of cooled saline was injected via a central vein.RESULTS.The baseline EVLW was 11.2\u00b15.8 ml/kg, the highest during the day was 12.7\u00b16.5 and the maximal during the first week was 14.1\u00b16.2. Maximal EVLW was significantly higher in nonsurvivors (n =57) than in survivors (n =40) [15.2\u00b16.9 versus 12.6\u00b14.8 respectively; p = 0.04,Fig 1], however the area under the ROC curve was only 0.6. In univariate analysis, only SOFA score (p=0.059) and daily fluid balance (p=0.045) were predictors for mortality. During the first week of ICU stay the EVLW, CLI and daily fluid balance remained higher in nonsurvivors (closed squares,Fig 2 Panel A-C). A biphasic CLI-evolution was observed in all patients, reaching maximal levels by day 3.",

The PRIMVAC registry (1) started in 1995 and has collected all acute myocardial infarctions episodes (AMI) admitted in the intensive coronary units (ICU) of the main hospitals in the Comunidad Valenciana (southeastern Spain).METHODS.Demographic, clinical, procedural and outcome variables were registered in such patients since 1995 till 2004. Analysis of variance (parametric or not) was used for continous variables and trends Mantel chi square for nominal data. Bootstraping was performed for time variables. S-Plus statistical packet was used.RESULTS.19,719 cases with MONICA diagnosis of AMI were included in the decade 1995-2004. Mean age was 65 (SD 12) with 24.3% female. Coronary risk factors: 48.3% had hypertension, 32.2% hypercholesterolemia, 36.5% were current smokers, 29.4% diabetics, 17.3% had prior myocardial infarction and 4.3% had received prior revascularization (2.6% angioplasty and 1.7% coronary bypass). Regarding AMI characteristics: anterior location 42.1%, inferior 43.5%, not specified in 14.4% and Q wave in 72.6%. Complications: III/IV Killip group 14.3%, ventricular taquicardia 5.8%. ventricular fibrillation 5.1%, atrial fibrillation 9.2%, complete AV block 5%, angina 9.3%, reinfarction 2.6%, right ventricle impairment 6.8%, mechanical complications 2.6%. Overall mean mortality was 12.2% with a slight but continuous and significant decrease over the years(14.1% in 1995 vs 9.1% in 2004,  p<0.01). Procedural variables: coronariography was performed in 13.6% of patients, 2.9% Swan-Ganz, 4.6%temporary pacemaker, intraaortic balloon pump 0.7%, mechanical ventilation 7.4%. Revascularization procedures: angioplasty was performed in 9.5%, cardiac surgery in 0.8% and thrombolysis in 44% of patients. Betablockers were used in 27.8% of patients, aspirin in 89.2% and ACE inhibitors in 42.3%. Time delay for thrombolysis was 180 min.CONCLUSION.In this large registry of AMI admitted in ICU of the Comunidad Valenciana, mortality remains high but with a significant reduction in the last years.

Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is a significant problem in Poland. Nonspecific spectrum of symptoms cause that many cases of poisoning are not recognized. CO poisoning is not common in pregnancy and can be easy unrecognized. It may have many adverse effects both to the mother and fetus. CO is fetotoxin and teratogen. Safety and efficacy of HBO2 in the treatment of pregnant women is not well established. The aim of this article is assess safety of HBO2 in the treatment of pregnant women with CO poisoning and the influence of HBO2 on time of delivery and children delivery in 1 year observation period.",

The diagnosis was made on the basis of medical history and symptoms and eleveted COHb level. The mean age of pregnants was 29 years (23-33), mean gestational age -32.25 hbd (22-38hbd) . Symptoms: loss of consciousness in 4 cases, which lasted 3 minutes, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 1 hour, respiratory insufficiency which demand intubation and mechanical ventilation for over half hour in one case, headache, and retrograde amnesia in all cases. Time from estimated exposure to HBO2 varied from 45 minutes to 4 hours (mean 2.44 hours). The reason of this was: 3 women were transported to our unit from others hospitals. The fetal CTG showed unprovoked decelerations to 100 bpm in 4 cases, and marked bradycardia in 1 case. Breathing with 100% oxygen was administered on the field, and patient were transported to our unit by ambulances. Patients were treated with HBO according to our protocol (1x2.8 ATA-90 minutes, 2x2.5 ATA-90 minutes in the first 24 hours. Then patients were observed in the Department of Toxicology, and consulted by obstetricians every 24 hours (CTG) for 7 days. All patients delivered in term at: 2x39, 2x40, 41 weeks gestation. The Apgar scores were 9 points in 1st minute and 10 points in 10th minutes after delivery in all cases. In one year observation all children have developed promptly.CONCLUSION. 1. HBO2 is the treatment of choice for CO poisoning and all pregnant women suffering CO intoxication should be referred for HBO2 therapy (irrespective to maternal symptoms and maternal COHb level). 2. HBO2 is safe and well tolerated by fetus.",

Adverse side effects were noticed in 12 patients (7%). Seventy four patients were treated with piperacillin / tazobactam. Four between them (5.5%) presented an eruption. None of them had a history of allergic reactions to any antimicrobial. After the drug was interrupted and antihistamines were given the eruption disappeared. Among sixty eight patients who received imipenem / cilastatin three presented side effects (4.4%). The first patient presented seizures, another one presented neutropenia and the third an allergic skin eruption. In the first case, seizures were attributed to a long duration of therapy while neutropenia in the second case to an overdose of the drug. Finally among 45 patients treated with linezolid, five (11%) presented severe thrombocytopenia (mean PLT number 22.000 / dl). Number of platelets continued to diminish for some time after the drug interruption. Thrombocytopenia appeared after a mean period of 8.8 \u00b1 4.6 days.

NSE and S-100b were measured in serum at 2+/-1h, 24+/-4h, 48+/-4h and 72+/-4h after cardiac arrest in patients with mixed initial rhythms and different locations of cardiac arrest. All patients were treated with induced hypothermia (33 \u2022 C for 24h and a slow rewarming 0.5 \u2022 C/h). After sedation was withdrawn the patients were evaluated neurologically. In patients who remained deeply unconscious (GCS 3-4) 72h after the time point when normothermia was reestablished, active treatment was withdrawn. All patients were evaluated according to the Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) scale when leaving the ICU, before leaving hospital and 6 months after cardiac arrest.

With an S-100b cut off of 0.55 at 24h we reached a specificity of 93% with a sensitivity of 53% for bad outcome. NSE values of 24 (24h) and 27 (48h) resulted in a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 49% and 70% respectively.

The best markers for neurologic outcome in this mixed group of hypothermia treated cardiac arrest patients were an S-100b level of 0.55 at 24h or a NSE of 27 at 48 h.

Diagnosis was performed from the history taken either from the patient or from the patient's relatives regarding the agent involved in the exposure. Intravenous atropine and pralidoxime was administered as soon as possible. Pralidoxime could not be given to 18 patients: 2 patients did not receive pralidoxime because they were late admissions, and 16 did not receive pralidoxime because the Ministry of Health office was out of stock. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation.RESULTS. There were 32 female and 29 male patients. Fourty (65.57%) were suicide attempts and 21 (34.43%) were accidental exposure patients. The mortality rates for the patients who did and did not receive pralidoxime were 30.2 and 16.7%, respectively and were not statistically different. Sixteen patients (26.23%) required mechanical ventilation. The mortality rate for the patients who required mechanical ventilation was 50%, but the rate was 17.8% for those patients who were not mechanically ventilated. Intermediate syndrome was been observed in 11 (18.03%) patients. Complications were observed in 40 (74.4%) patients. The duration of the intensive care stay was 5.80 \u00b1 3.37 days.CONCLUSION. OP insecticide poisoning is a serious condition that requires rapid diagnosis and treatment. Because respiratory failure is the major reason for mortality, careful monitoring, appropriate management and early recognition of this complication may decrease the mortality rate among these patients.

Worsening of sensorium was the most common presenting neurological symptom (40%) at the time of admission to our ICU followed by new onset of alteration in sensorium (20%), seizures (20%) and generalized motor weakness (20%). Mean admission APACHE II was 12. Malnutrition (30%) and prolonged diuretic therapy (30%) were the most common predisposing factors. All patients were of chronic hyponatremia (>48hrs) with serum sodium less than 120 meq/l. In all patients the rate of correction of sodium was more than 10 meq/l/24 hours. Hypokalemia was the most common associated biochemical abnormality (60%) followed by hyperglycemia (20%), hypophosphatemia (20%) and elevated serum creatinine (20%).

For many years, pulmonary artery catheterization has been a method of choice for assessing preload at the bedside in critical care units. Despite many recent concerns about its use, and the lack of evidence for benefits in medical trials, it is estimated that nearly a million pulmonary artery catheters are used per annum in the USA. Hemodynamic changes associated with mechanical ventilation have been proposed as predictors of preload in critical care patients. The Valsalva maneuver has been described in previous trials as a useful tool for assessing preload; it appears to be a safe procedure, but it has not been tested in seriously ill patients.",

The area together with the anterior-posterior (APD) and left-right (LRD) diameter during end-expiration and inspiration were measured.

All patients were in sinus rhythm and underwent both a TEE and CAP. Invasive PAOP measured with CAP was used as reference. In each patient, the following conventional Doppler parameters were measured (mean of 3 end-expiratory measurements): mitral Doppler E/A ratio, pulmonary vein Doppler S/D ratio and systolic fraction (SF = VTI S/VTI S+D). In the last 26 patients, new Doppler parameters were also measured: early diastolic blood flow propagation velocity with color M-mode (Vp), and early tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) velocities of the lateral aspect of the mitral ring (Ea), with E/Vp and E/Ea ratios. Inter-and intra-observer variability in measured parameters was 1 to 13% and 2 to 7%, respectively.

Tracheostomy (surgical and percutaneous) is a well-established procedure for prolonged mechanical ventilation in the critically ill adult patient. Fiberoptic laryngotracheoscopy (FLT) is used in the evaluation of the trachea following decannulation but it involves discomfort. Today it is possible to perform virtual endoscopy by multislice CT within seconds even in debilitated patients. Our aim was to confirm the value of virtual laryngo-tracheoscopy (VLT) in the diagnosis of cervical tracheal granulations and stenosis of various grades in clinic and in an animal model experiment.",

Navigation through the laryngo-tracheal lumen as well as reformatted coronal and sagittal images were performed on GE AW 4 workstation. The animal studies were done on 10 adult dead pigs in three series. In the first series, normal parameters of the larynx and cervical trachea were examined with adult bronchoscope Olympus (FLT) and after that by VLT. In the next two series, cervical tracheal granulations and stenosis were simulated and examined by both methods. The parameters of the larynx and cervical trachea were accurately measured RESULTS. The pathological changes in the clinical study found with the help of VLT were: mural granulations, polypoid mass in the tracheal wall, tracheal wall flap and flap with a persistent tract. When the FLT was performed it showed the same findings. The animal study confirmed our supposition that endoscopic pictures and virtual images provided similar macroscopic appearance. In most lesions, the measurements and localization of the abnormalities with VLT were more precise and easy to perform compared with FLT.",

The average age has not changed significantly, with a range of 104-137 days. The percentage of children in the group aged less then 49 days has varied greatly from 0% to 31% of the whole group. The increase in the admission rates of all infants is strongly correlated to a rise in the admission rate amongst infants aged less then 49 days (r=0.776). The total number of children in the group less then 49 days also strongly correlates with the admission rate (r=0.593) while there is no significant correlation of children aged 49-90 days (r=-0.004) and over 90 days (r=-0.004) with admission rates.CONCLUSION. The recent rise in the admission rates to ICU/HDU is strongly correlated to the rise in percentage of the infants aged less then 49 days in the group as a whole, and also the rise in the percentage of children less then 49 days requiring admission to ICU/HDU. Maternal protective antibodies are postulated to play a significant role in the protection of these infants aged less then 49 days. An antigenic shift in the RSV may be occurring resulting in fewer infants receiving transplacental immunity to the virus. To further investigate this, a prospective national audit is being carried out this year to determine this, and other possible causative factors.",

CMV viremia was diagnosed within 25.83\u00b19.62 days after ICU admission. All patients fulfilled the sepsis criteria, were on mechanical ventilation, experienced renal failure and 4 p needed dialysis. All were on enteral nutrition. All p had been transfused but blood transfusion is considered a contamination risk when blood products were not leukocyte depleted. In our practice, all blood products used were leukocyte depleted. But this process usually does not eliminate all leukocytes, and few leukocytes are required for a CMV viremia to be positive. 1p received a 14-days antiviral therapy.CONCLUSION. CMV viremia is not an uncommon diagnosis in critically ill CSICU, regardless of their immune system status. The clinical significance of CMV is unknown and the differentiation between CMV detection and CMV disease represent a difficult diagnosis dilemma.

Table 1 : If the patient is alert and orientated, is and should their poor prognosis and plan of care discussed with them? Table 2 . Do and should the family help to decide on level of monitoring in a dying patient? CONCLUSION. These results give an insight into staff attitudes to death and dying in ICU, as well as current practice. Some of the answers are unexpected. Not only is a poor prognosis and subsequent plan of care not always discussed with an alert and orientated patient, but also staff feel these discussions should be less frequent. In an era of patient autonomy, paternalism of this sort is becoming outmoded. We are unclear why alarms should so frequently be enabled in dying patients. It may be that staff feel insecure without the backup of alarms. The level of family involvement in decisions about monitoring is more contentious and the spread of answers understandable. We hope that these results will eventually allow a consensus to emerge in Scotland about some aspects of palliative care for dying patients in ICU.",
