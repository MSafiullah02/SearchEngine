Human serum specimens from newborns were collected at the department of Medical Microbiology, Academic Medical Center (AMC), Laboratory of Experimental Virology. All children (12 males and 13 females) were born to HIV-1-positive mothers, with various dates of birth (1993, n\n = 1; 1997, n\n = 1; 1998, n\n = 3; 1999, n\n = 4; 2000, n\n = 1; 2001, n\n = 1; 2002, n\n = 4; 2003, n\n = 7; and 2004, n\n = 3). In a previous study we compared the average age of seroconversion in the children born from HIV infected mothers and those born from healthy mothers. The mean seroconversion age was not different,10 therefore we treated this group of 25 children as a representative of the wider population. Serum samples were obtained at birth, age 1 month, 3 months, 12 months, approximately 20 months, and for some also at approximately 24 months. Serum samples were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. All newborns remained HIV-1 RNA negative and were HIV-1 seronegative during the follow-up period. Twenty-four of the 25 children were never hospitalized during the follow up period. One child was hospitalized in the first month of life due to an influenza infection. So none of the 25 children needed hospitalization at the moment they were infected by the HCoVs. Thirteen of the 25 newborns were part of a previous survey on HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E seroconversion.10 Respiratory samples were not collected. All serum samples were heat-inactivated at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min.",

In a previous study we show that the carboxyl part of the N protein of 229E and NL63 elicit specific antibodies that allow differentiation between both species.16 Given the shared structural and functional domain features among coronavirus N proteins we applied the same approach for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, since cross-reactivity by the antibodies directed to the full-N of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 has been reported in human sera.16, 17, 18 The HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E recombinant NCt proteins were produced as previously described.12 The generation of the plasmid for NCt-OC43 and NCt-HKU1 was performed using the same method. Briefly, for NCt-OC43 the following primer combination was used 5\u2032 OC43_N5_CT (5\u2032-CACCAGATTAGAGTTGGCCAAAGTG-3\u2032) and 3\u2032 OC43_Nexp (5\u2032-TTATATTTCTGAGGTGTCTTCAGTATAG-3\u2032), whereas for NCt-HKU1 the primer combination 5\u2032-HKU1_5N_CT (5\u2032-CACCAAATTAGACTTGGTTAAAAGAGTCCG-3\u2032) and 3\u2032 HKU1_Nexp (5\u2032-TTAAGCAACAGAGTCTTCTACATAAG-3\u2032) was used. The generated pET100_OC43_NCt and pET100_HKU1_NCt plasmids were sequenced and shown to be 100% identical to the virus reference sequences of HCoV-HKU1 (Caen1, HM034837) and HCoV-OC43 (VR-759, AY391777), respectively. Subsequent expression and purification of the HCoV recombinant carboxyl-terminal N (NCt) proteins were performed exactly as described elsewhere.10 The NCt proteins from HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, like those from HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E, retained their immunogenicity in ELISA (checked with longitudinal sera from adults, or pooled human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg, Sanquin)). We performed competition experiments to ascertain specificity: positive human serum from adults or human IVIG was diluted (1:200) in PBST containing 1% skim milk, and twofold serial dilutions (ranging from 0 to 50 \u03bcg/ml) of NCt protein of HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, or HCoV-HKU1 were added. The mixtures were briefly homogenized by vortexing prior to incubation for 1 h at RT. Following the preincubations, the samples were measured by either NL63- and 229E-ELISA or OC43- and HKU1-ELISA (so preincubated with the NCt form the other virus of the same genus). No cross reactivity was observed.",

This study covered 5 consecutive years, and children were included at two locations: The Netherlands and South-east of Scotland. Between December 2006 and February 2011 a total of 207 (14%) out of 1471 children were HCoV infected.

In healthy children high frequency of seroconversion towards HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 were detected, and to a lesser extent seroconversion to HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-229E. Serosurveillance of otherwise healthy individuals subverts bias for analyses of patients with higher severity of symptoms as is an inevitable consequence of hospital based studies, thus providing a much clearer representation of virus epidemiology in the community. These data provide the opportunity to compare the natural infection frequency of each HCoV with the frequency with which these viruses are found in hospitalized children with acute respiratory infections within a community, something that has not been achieved previously. We investigated children who were hospitalized with acute respiratory tract illness, below the age of 2 years. This provides a selection of children with severe HCoV infections requiring hospitalization. Prevalence data in these hospital children and the serology in the healthy children are in complete accordance, revealing that there are no indications that any of the four HCoVs causes significantly more hospitalization than another.",
