At that time manufacturing of surfactant preparations from porcine and bovine origin started, paralleled by a stunning increase in controlled trials within a few years. Administration of exogenous surfactant to preterm infants with RDS started its triumphal procession rapidly across many countries, hindered only by relatively high costs of therapy. Numerous subsequent trials in the past decades confirmed not only the effectiveness of surfactant to improve mortality, need for ventilation and short-term outcome, but also to have a huge impact on residual morbidity of low-birth-weight infants. Nowadays, surfactant therapy has become the standard therapy of newborn RDS and is deemed one of the most effective and safe medicines in the health system by the WHO.",

Eighty-five percent of the phospholipid fraction itself consists of phosphatidylcholines, the most important component (40%) with the highest compaction properties being di-palmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC); 11% consists of phosphatidylglyerol and phoshatidylinositol, which fluidize the lipid monolayer. The remaining fraction consists of various phospholipids with particular functions. Cholesterol is the major neutral lipid (85%). The various lipid fractions are transported from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum into multivesicular bodies, they are assembled and stored with the other lipid and protein fractions in lamellar bodies, and then secreted into the alveolar space, forming tubular myelin and finally the dynamic surfactant monolayer at the fluid\u2212air interface. Protein components of surfactant are apolipoproteins and a repertoire of specific proteins, called surfactant protein (SP)-A, -B, -C and -D, which are produced by type II cells and contribute different essential surfactant functions.",

In addition, SP-A enhances the activity of SP-B and SP-C and preserves the integrity of extensively packed lipid\u2013protein complexes, thus optimizing surfactant performance under particularly demanding physiological conditions, and prevents inhibition of surfactant by serum components. SP-D action on surfactant function is less clearly defined but could be important for promoting production of a surplus of surfactant in processes and situations where surfactant homeostasis is challenged.1 SP-B and SP-C are essential for spreading and for the physicochemical function of surfactant. SP-B is critical for adsorption of surfactant phospholipids into the fluid\u2212air interface and the dynamic behavior of interfacial surfactant films subjected to the continuous compression\u2013expansion cycling resulting from tidal respiration.1,2 Its critical role is well demonstrated by severe respiratory failure and neonatal death in case of genetically determined SP-B deficiency, either in human disease or in animal models.3 SP-C is able to promote adsorption and transfer of phospholipids into the fluid\u2212air interface, and promotes the formation of multilamellar structures associated with the interface during compression of surfactant films close to functional residual capacity (FRC).4 Lack of SP-C results in lung inflammation and pneumonia; however, it has only minor or delayed clinical effects in animal models, and SP-C mutation-associated lung disease in humans results from protein misfolding or mistrafficking rather than from haploinsufficiency.5 All proteins are also essential to keep the mixture of surfactant lipids and proteins in a liquid phase.",

This innovative technique allows simultaneous analysis of multiple samples, making it suitable for clinical applications as well as for experimental testing of pharmacological compounds. Adapting this assay for clinical testing, Danhaive et al.13 demonstrated the correlation of surfactant film formation properties with SP-B content in preterm infants receiving late surfactant therapy for persisting respiratory failure. Using a similar technique, De Luca et al.14 described the positive effect of whole-body hypothermia on surfactant function after 48 h in term infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and respiratory failure. Autilio et al.15 showed that SAT values could predict continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) failure and the need for surfactant replacement in preterm infants \u226432 weeks gestational age (GA) with RDS, compared to established clinical criteria and validated tests such as lung ultrasonography or LBC.

For poractant alfa a high dose of 200 mg/kg, as compared to a lower dose of 100 mg/kg, led to better survival and decreased risk for complications such as persistent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and intraventricular hemorrhage.29 A higher first dose also reduces the need for repeat doses. Older studies, before implementation of antenatal steroids and with other ventilation strategies, suggested that multiple doses of surfactant had additive effects in reducing complications such as pneumothorax. Recent guidelines do not recommend repeat doses routinely, but advise that a second (and third) dose should be given to infants with ongoing or progressing respiratory distress. Surfactant treatment during CPAP, such as INSURE (INtubation-SURfactant-Extubation) and LISA (Less Invasive Surfactant Administration), may reduce the need for repeat doses.30",

Animal models have shown that ANS accelerate lung maturation by thinning of the walls between the alveolar and vascular compartment and by speeding up maturation of the surfactant producing type II pneumocytes.68 As a result lung volumes and mechanics are improved. Furthermore, ANS treatment enhances the effect of exogenous surfactant on these outcomes and on lung function.69 In summary, ANS together with surfactant independently, but also additively, reduce mortality, severity of RDS, and air leak of preterm infants.

However, it is important to mention that these negative effects of delayed surfactant treatment have mainly been observed in trials using invasive mechanical ventilation as initial strategy for respiratory support after birth. Nowadays, many centers have adopted noninvasive ventilation as the primary mode postnatally, and studies have shown that delaying surfactant treatment under these circumstances does not have a negative effect on its efficacy, when compared with primary invasive respiratory support combined with early (prophylactic) surfactant treatment.70",

On the other hand, these effects are difficult to distinguish from effects resulting from the frequently observed increase in pCO2, leading in particular to cerebral vasodilation and a decrease of left-to-right-shunt across the PDA after increase of pulmonary vascular resistance. But there are also conflicting results regarding change of cerebral blood flow velocity and/or regional cerebral oxygenation immediately after surfactant and uncertainty about pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary blood flow. These parameters can be measured only indirectly, but differences in timing of measurement, surfactant dose and persistence of PDA may also lead to varying results.
