The results of MERS-CoV\u2013specific serologic tests of the camel workers were described in a broader Qatar-wide seroprevalence study by Reusken et al [5]. Nine camel workers with antibodies specific for MERS-CoV and 43 workers without such antibodies as previously determined by S1-based protein microarray testing were included in this study [5]. A total of 3\u20134 seronegative workers per seropositive worker were randomly selected, based on the proximity of their bed to a seropositive worker, their age, their sex, and the date they joined the farm. Exclusion criteria were hospital admission within 14 days before serum sampling or recent contact (ie, within 14 days) with a person confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV or with a hospitalized patient with a respiratory illness of unknown cause. None of the selected workers refused to participate or met the exclusion criteria.",

            "text": "We looked at possible correlations between different putative risk factors for MERS-CoV infection and the presence of MERS-CoV antibodies in camel workers. The univariate analysis revealed a correlation between the presence of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in camel farm workers and cleaning farm equipment (P = .05), assisting in animal birth (P = .08), milking animals (P = .03), and training animals (P = .01). Cleaning farm equipment might represent an increased risk of MERS-CoV exposure through contact with camel saliva, feces, and/or urine on soiled equipment [6, 7]. All animal workers that were involved in calvings also milked camels more than once per week. The relative high number of workers with MERS-CoV antibodies who assisted in the birth of camels and in milking animals may be explained by intensive contact with young camels. Although newborn calves are still protected by maternal antibodies, workers who assist in animal birth or milking often remain in close contact with mothers and their calves beyond the period of maternal protection [8]. For example, milking requires the presence of suckling young camels who trigger milk flow [9]. Moreover, camel milk can contain MERS-CoV RNA [9]. An association between MERS-CoV illness and milking has been described before [10]. Camel training, which requires close contact between the animal and its trainer, also seemed to increase the risk for MERS-CoV infection in camel workers. This is in agreement with previous reports that indicated that close contact with camels can be a risk factor for MERS-CoV illness or the presence of MERS-CoV antibodies [5, 10, 11].",

The reported presence of dogs correlated strongly with the presence of animal feces (origin unknown) around the subject\u2019s living quarters (P = .001). There is currently no evidence of a role for dogs in MERS-CoV epidemiology. A possible explanation for the association between the presence of dogs and MERS-CoV\u2013seropositive humans could be that dogs mechanically spread contaminated camel products (eg, feces and urine) around the farm complex.",

            "text": "The cohort with antibodies against MERS-CoV had a greater percentage of workers who rarely washed their hands, and washing hands before and after animal tasks appeared to have a preventive effect. Prevention of MERS-CoV infection or exposure by handwashing possibly indicates that MERS-CoV can be indirectly transmitted via fomites. Infectious MERS-CoV could still be detected on surfaces after 1 day at 30\u00b0C and in milk after 2 days at 22\u00b0C in experimental conditions [12, 13]. Contact with camel excretions and subsequent touching of mucous membranes may be an important source of infection. Nasal secretions have been shown more frequently to contain MERS-CoV and have higher viral loads as compared to camel urine, feces, and saliva [6]. Human-to-human transmission may also take place via fomites. This can explain why many individuals with a primary case of MERS-CoV infection have not reported direct camel contact and, in some cases, have reported a household member who recently visited a camel farm [10, 14].",

Therefore, we could only perform univariate analyses and very limited multivariate analyses to demonstrate signi\ufb01cant associations between possible risk factors and MERS-CoV antibody presence in the respondents. Moreover, the retrospective study design may have resulted in significant recall bias among participants with regard to their and their camels\u2019 activities and health in the last 12 months. Because workers share housing and sleeping areas, MERS-CoV may have spread from human to human. This means that not all seropositive workers may have been infected directly by camels, which may affect the analysis. Last, it is possible that the MERS-CoV immunoglobulin G we detected was a result of exposure in the worker\u2019s country of origin rather than in Qatar, with MERS-CoV circulation known to exist among camels in some such countries.",
