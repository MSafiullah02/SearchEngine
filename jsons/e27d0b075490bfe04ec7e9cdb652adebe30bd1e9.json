            "text": "Acute demyelination of adult CNS, resulting from trauma or disease, is initially followed by remyelination. However, chronic lesions with subsequent functional impairment result from eventual failure of the remyelination process, as seen in multiple sclerosis. Studies using animal models of successful remyelination delineate a progression of events facilitating remyelination. A universal feature of this repair process is extensive proliferation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPs) in response to demyelination. To investigate signals that regulate OP proliferation in response to demyelination we used murine hepatitis virus-A59 (MHV-A59) infection of adult mice to induce focal demyelination throughout the spinal cord followed by spontaneous remyelination. We cultured glial cells directly from demyelinating and remyelinating spinal cords using conditions that maintain the dramatically enhanced OP proliferative response prior to CNS remyelination. We identify PDGF and FGF2 as significant mitogens regulating this proliferative response. Furthermore, we demonstrate endogenous PDGF and FGF2 activity in these glial cultures isolated from demyelinated CNS tissue. These findings correlate well with our previous demonstration of increased in vivo expression of PDGF and FGF2 ligand and corresponding receptors in MHV-A59 lesions. Together these studies support the potential of these pathways to function in vivo as critical factors in regulating remyelination.",

In demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), myelin damage results in impaired conduction and pro-gressive axonal degeneration. Limited spontaneous remyelination occurs in acute MS lesions, yet recurring myelin damage is not sufficiently repaired (Raine and Wu, 1993; Prineas et al., 1993) . The cellular and molecular mechanisms of remyelination are not clear, however, a key feature is the generation of remyelinating cells from local precursor cells. Several studies have identified immature oligodendrocyte lineage cells (OLCs) in the normal adult human CNS (Wolswijk and Noble, 1989; Armstrong et al., 1992; Scolding et al., 1995; Roy et al., 1999) , and the density of these immature OLCs is increased in acute MS lesions (Chang et al., 2000; Maeda et al., 2001) . These precursor cells may serve as targets for developing therapeutic strategies to improve OLC regeneration and the extent of remyelination in human demyelinating diseases.",

In addition, we examine the significance of endogenously produced PDGF and FGF2 in the cultures using inhibitors specific to each pathway. Importantly, at two distinct phases of disease progression, demyelination and early remyelination, we compare OLC responses elicited by exogenous and endogenous PDGF and FGF2.

The PDGF\u2423R is a protein tyrosine kinase receptor with numerous sites of phosphorylation that interact with several different signal transduction molecules (Heldin and Westermark, 1999) . Therefore, to block activity of the PDGF pathway, we selected a specific inhibitor of the kinase activity of the PDGF\u2423R. The AG1295 compound (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) is 6,7-dimethyl-2-phenylquinoxaline, a tyrphostin that selectively inhibits phosphorylation by the PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase. AG1295 has previously been shown to have no effect on autophosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor even at concentrations up to 100 M (Kovalenko et al., 1994) . Kovalenko et al. (1994) further showed that the IC 50 for AG1295 inhibition of DNA synthesis in Swiss 3T3 cells was 2.5 M. Other studies have used 10 M AG1295 to specifically inhibit PDGF receptor activation (Banai et al., 1998; Iwamoto et al., 2000) . A dose response curve (1.0, 2.5, 10, and 25 M) of AG1295 was used to test the inhibition of proliferation of nOPs in response to 10 ng/mL PDGF-AA. Based upon the results with nOPs a single concentration of 10 M AG1295 was used for the adult OLC proliferation studies.",

Mice were sacrificed at either of two stages of the disease progression: at 14 -17 dpi (\"2 wpi\"), or at 28 -32 dpi (\"4 wpi\"). Spinal cords were removed from six mice for each mixed glial cell preparation. Whole spinal cords were used in this study because of the uncertainties of the anatomical locations of various potential pools of precursor cells that may contribute to remyelination, and because prolonged microdissection time to isolate the multiple focal lesion areas throughout each cord would significantly decrease cell yield in cultures. The spinal cords were minced and dissociated according to a protocol modified from Armstrong et al. (1990) . Briefly, tissue was incubated at 37\u00b0C in 0.25% trypsin (Sigma) with 50 U/mL DNase I (Sigma) in cold isolation medium [MEM-HEPES supplemented with 25 g/mL gentamicin, 5000 U/mL penicillin, and 5 mg/mL streptomycin (Sigma)] twice for 14 min each.

The cells were plated onto extracellular matrix coated 35 mm tissue culture dishes (Accurate Chemical, Westbury, NY) at a density of one spinal cord per two to three dishes, in a volume of 200 L/dish, and incubated at 37\u00b0C. After 2 h a further 1.3 mL DFM was added to each dish. Two days later the medium was removed and replaced with Sato's medium plus growth factors and/or inhibitors.

Mice were tested for limb motor impairment (hang time) prior to being sacrificed for mixed glial cultures between 14 -17 days postinjection (dpi) (during demyelination \"D\"), and between 28 -32 dpi (remyelination \"R\"). Hang time was scored as the period that each mouse could hang upside down from a metal cage top. Prior to infection and upon recovery, mice could hold on for a maximum allowed period of 60 s.

AG1295 is a specific inhibitor of PDGF receptor activated DNA synthesis, with an IC 50 of 2.5 M in Swiss 3T3 cells (Kovalenko et al., 1994) that has previously been shown to inhibit PDGF induced proliferation of several different cell types (for example Banai et al., 1998; Iwamoto et al., 2000) . In this study a dose response analysis of AG1295 showed that 2.5 M AG1295 only inhibited PDGF induced proliferation by 9.1%, whereas 10 M AG1295 inhibited PDGF induced proliferation by 35.8%, back to levels seen in cultures without PDGF (Fig. 5) . Previous studies have demonstrated that at 10 M, AG1295 inhibited the phosphorylation of PDGF receptors and subsequent downstream signaling pathways leading to proliferation, without inhibiting the tyrosine kinase activity of the EGF receptor (Kovalenko et al., 1994; Banai et al., 1998) . Therefore, subsequent experiments used 10 M AG1295 to maximally inhibit PDGF\u2423R signaling in the nOP cultures (Fig. 5 ) without compromising cell viability (assessed by a propidium iodide exclusion assay; data not shown). Compared to EGF receptors, FGF tyrosine kinase receptors are even more closely related to the PDGF\u2423R. Therefore, we confirmed that AG1295 inhibition was specific to PDGF by showing that AG1295 did not affect proliferation induced by FGF2 (Fig. 5) . In parallel experiments, the FGF2nAb (at 1 g/mL, the recommended ND 50 ) significantly inhibited the nOP proliferation induced by FGF2 (Fig.  5) , without compromising cell viability (data not shown), yet had no marked effect on the PDGF-AA response (Fig. 5) .",

During the first weeks after intracranial injection of the virus, throughout the spinal cord focal lesions develop and are characterized by significant oligodendrocyte loss with subsequent myelin destruction (Jordan et al., 1989) . This demyelination of the spinal cord results in paresis, paralysis, and grasping difficulty (represented in Fig. 1 ; Godfraind et al., 1989; Jordan et al., 1989; Redwine and Armstrong, 1998) . Remyelination can be identified by light microscopy at 3-4 wpi, with several wraps of myelin visible by electron microscopy at 4 wpi, which coincides with recovery of motor function (Jordan et al., 1989; Redwine and Armstrong, 1998) . The number of remyelinated axons and thickness of myelin continues to progress in subsequent weeks (Jordan et al., 1989; Armstrong et al., 1990) . This study and our previous work (Armstrong et al., 1990) used cultures prepared from spinal cords of MHV-A59 infected mice to examine cellular responses to demyelination and remyelination. To ensure inclusion of all potential pools of progenitors (discussed in Reynolds et al., 2001) , entire spinal cords from severely affected mice were used to prepare mixed glial cultures for this study. Using this in vitro system we have previously shown that the total number of OLCs isolated from spinal cords at progressive stages of the MHV-A59 induced disease is significantly increased when compared to age matched controls (Armstrong et al., 1990 ). The present study shows significantly more OLC proliferation occurring during the demyelination stage of the disease, and more specifically identifies NG2 \u03e9 OPs as the major proliferative phenotype within the OLC population (Fig. 6 ). During remyelination (4 wpi) we also found that the total number of OLCs (Armstrong et al., 1990) , and more specifically the number of NG2 \u03e9 OPs (current study, data not shown), was significantly increased compared to age matched control animals (Armstrong et al., 1990) . The most proliferative NG2 \u03e9 cells were negative for O1 immunostaining ( Figs. 6 and 8) . Thus, this technique appears to distinguish progenitors from remyelinating spinal cord compared with a report of normal adult progenitors from optic nerve expressing NG2 or A2B5 with O1 (Shi et al., 1998) .",

Thus, our in vitro system maintains the progression of OLC proliferation, accumulation, and differentiation that has been documented to occur in experimental models of demyelination and remyelination in vivo (Ludwin, 1979; Godfraind et al., 1989; Mason et al., 2000; McTigue et al., 2001) . Therefore, we can take advantage of this in vitro model to facilitate a reductionist approach to the investigation of putative growth factor and cytokine interactions that regulate OLC responses during spontaneous remyelination of the adult CNS. Based upon previous developmental and in vitro studies we focused on examining the effects of PDGF and FGF2 signaling to determine the mechanisms Figure 9 Oligodendrocyte lineage cells are more likely to differentiate in cultures derived during remyelination. Differentiation of the OLC population in mixed glial cultures of remyelinating spinal cords (4 wpi) was assessed using stage-specific markers. Black bars represent NG2 \u03e9 O1 \u03ea OPs, gray bars represent transitional NG2 \u03e9 O1 \u03e9 cells, and white bars represent premyelinating NG2 \u03ea O1 \u03e9 oligodendrocytes. (A) After 2 days in vitro (div) in DME plus 10% FBS, the OLC population within the cultures consisted of predominantly NG2 \u03e9 O1 \u03ea OPs. However, in contrast to cultures from 2 wpi (Fig. 7) , after a further 3 days in Sato's defined medium alone (control), there were significantly fewer NG2 \u03e9 OPs, with the majority of cells being in later stages of the lineage. (B) The addition of exogenous PDGF-AA and/or FGF2 significantly increases the percentage of NG2 \u03e9 O1 \u03ea cells in the cultures. The growth factor inhibitors, AG1295 and anti-FGF2 neutralizing antibody (FGF2nAb), had no effect on OLC differentiation in the cultures when used either individually or in combination. For each value (\u03eeS.E.M.) n \u03ed 3-6 dishes per treatment across at least four different glial preparations. (p vs. control ***p \u03fd .005). Statistical analysis was one-way analysis of variance, followed by paired two-tailed t test analysis. regulating enhanced OP proliferation in response to demyelination. During development PDGF and FGF2, both individually and in combination, are important regulators of nOP proliferation prior to myelination in the developing CNS (B\u00f6gler et al., 1990; McKinnon et al., 1990; van Heyningen et al., 2001) . In addition, PDGF and FGF2 regulate the proliferation of OP cells isolated from normal adult optic nerve, spinal cord, and corpus callosum (Wolswijk and Noble, 1992; Engel and Wolswijk, 1996; Mason and Goldman, 2002) . Studies of ligand and receptor localization in lesions of the MHV-A59 model provide further support for a potential role for PDGF and FGF2 during remyelination in vivo (Redwine and Armstrong, 1998; Messersmith et al., 2000) .",

Surprisingly, our earlier study showed no effects of exogenous PDGF and FGF2 on the proliferation of OLCs in the cultures derived from MHV-A59 lesioned spinal cords (Armstrong et al., 1990) . The present study demonstrates a logical explanation for these previous results being disparate with the predicted role of PDGF and FGF2, and provides further insights into the potential activity of PDGF and FGF2 in the progression of demyelination and remyelination. The current work clearly shows: the importance of the combination of PDGF and FGF2, as well as endogenously produced PDGF and FGF2, in the regulation of OLC proliferation; the NG2 \u03e9 OP stage of OLCs is most responsive to PDGF and FGF2; depending upon the disease stage used for preparation of the cultures, the NG2 \u03e9 OP sensitivity varies, possibly in response to changes in the level of exogenous versus endogenous PDGF and FGF2. The mitogenic activity of endogenous PDGF and FGF2 appears most important during the demyelination phase when overall OP proliferation is most robust. Further studies of the growth factor expression within the cultures and the receptor downstream signaling pathways are required to fully elucidate the regulatory mechanism of these growth factor pathways.",

The present study used clonal analysis to distinguish between these two different potential roles of PDGF and FGF2 during remyelination. Our results (Fig. 11) show that the differentiation of \u2424-gal \u03e9 OLC clones is not affected by the addition of exogenous PDGF and FGF2, whereas OP proliferation is increased. This implies that other putative factors are present in the cultures, and potentially in Figure 11 Quantification of clonal analysis. Cultures derived from remyelinating spinal cords (4 wpi) were infected with BAG replication-incompetent retrovirus to introduce \u2424-galactosidase as a heritable marker. OLCs were characterized using antigen-specific markers for the different stages of the oligodendrocyte lineage (as shown in Fig. 10 ). The number of clones identified within each treatment is an indicator of the level of proliferation within that treatment at the time of retroviral infection. A combination of exogenous PDGF-AA and FGF2 (triangles) increases the total number of OLC clones relative to control conditions (circles). Inhibition of the PDGF and FGF2 (squares) reduces the total number of clones/dish. Each treatment was repeated in four dishes within each of two different glial preparations. Statistical analysis was one-way analysis of variance, followed by paired two-tailed t test analysis.",

Glial Growth Factor 2, TNF\u2423, and TGF-\u24241 may contribute to a hierarchy of growth factor interaction that, along with PDGF and FGF2, may regulate OP proliferation and differentiation to bring about remyelination (Cannella et al., 1998; Shi et al., 1998; Hinks and Franklin, 1999; Arnett et al., 2001) . Other growth factors, such as IGF1, may also promote oligodendrocyte survival in demyelinating diseases (Mason et al., 2000) . However, more detailed methods of analysis will be required to clarify the role of other trophins in the regulation of OLCs during remyelination. Further studies will be important to assess the in vivo efficacy of a growth-factor-based therapeutic strategy, and to extend this work to the context of human demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. The present study illustrates how the control of the effects of growth factor treatment for demyelinating disease may require knowledge of the most responsive cell populations, the interactions among combinations of trophins, and how growth factor therapies may need to be modulated throughout a disease course.",
