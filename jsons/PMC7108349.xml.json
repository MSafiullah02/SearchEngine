            "text": "In the present study, KIV and WUV infected individuals were found in two main age groups: <15 years and >45 years. A relatively high proportion of KIV and WUV infections were observed in the oldest (>60 years) age group. Infection in patients <15 years was more frequently associated with lower respiratory tract symptoms. They also showed more frequent co-infections with other respiratory viruses. The older age group patients (>45 years old) were more likely to have symptoms associated with upper respiratory tract infection. Samples collected from patients whose age was >18 months tended to be patients undergoing solid organ or bone marrow transplantation, treatment of cancer (particularly leukaemia), or were hospitalised because of severe, life threatening, acute respiratory distress. These data suggest that infection with KIV and WUV occurs early in childhood. The viruses may then establish persistent infection possibly in the respiratory tract and become reactivated during respiratory disease of any cause. The age distribution of positive cases in this study presents a pattern of infection similar to that seen with JCV and BKV. Further studies of the seroprevalence of KIV and WUV in different age groups will shed light on this issue.",
