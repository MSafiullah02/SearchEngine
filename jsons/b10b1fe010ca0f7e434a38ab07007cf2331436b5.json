The usual coding plasticity afforded to 169 nucleotides in the third position of a codon is nullified when overlapping reading frames are present, 170 and so the CpG spike at this gene boundary is not surprising. Thus, although the SARS-CoV-2 171 genome exhibits high CpG suppression overall, there are local heterogeneities associated with 172 individual ORFs, most notably E. 173 On the origins of the high CpG content of E ORF of SARS-CoV-2. To determine whether the high 174 CpG content of E ORF is evolutionarily conserved (ORF10 is poorly conserved and only encoded by 175 a subset of SARS-like coronaviruses, so it was not analysed), attempts to identify the E ORF by 176 nucleotide alignment for the set of 215 coronavirus sequences was undertaken, compared with E 177 ORFs already annotated in NCBI. Of the 215 sequences, E ORF was identifiable in 178, with the 178 remaining sequences too divergent to be confident of gene assignment. CpG composition for E ORF 179for the 178 sequences was measured and plotted according to host(Fig. 4A). A diverse distribution of 180 CpG content was evident in viruses from every host group except ungulates, with bats in particular 181 displaying a notable range from total suppression to overrepresentation. Otherwise, most viruses from 182 most species still maintained some level of CpG suppression in E ORF. Overall, there was a 183 significant difference between the mean CpG O:E ratio across host groups by 1-way ANOVA (p < 184 0.0001), but no significant differences were identified in pairwise comparisons of viral CpG 185 compositions between hosts. The exceptions with high CpG O:E ratios in E ORF were four avian 186 coronaviruses and notably, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, other human-infecting 187 coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43) all strongly under-188 represented CpG in E ORF, while MERS-CoV E ORF had an intermediate CpG O:E ratio of 0.6.To 189 confirm E ORF over-represented CpG relative to the rest of the genome in SARS-CoV and SARS-190",

Conceivably, the ORF9b and ORF10 do not have their own TRSs and so whether or how these open reading frames are 264 accessed is currently controversial; nevertheless, peptides from both have been identified by mass 265 spectrometry from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells(Davidson, et al. 2020). The ORF9b AUG 266 transcription initiation site, which has a strong Kozak context (Kozak 1986), is the first AUG after 267 and 10 nucleotides downstream of the initiation site for N ORF (which displays moderate Kozak 268 context). It is therefore credible to think that ORF9b is accessed via leaky ribosomal scanning -a well 269 characterised method for accessing alternative ORFs used by coronaviruses and other viruses (Lin and The transcript encoding E ORF incorporates an additional ~3.4kb of RNA and ORF10, if accessed 279from the transcript produced from the TRS upstream of N ORF, is present on a transcript of",

CpG and UpA composition of complete genomes or of individual ORFeome were calculated using the SSE v1.4 composition scan function. 354Individual ORFs were concatenated with a separating 'NNN' codon for analysis, and secondary 355overlapping ORFs were not included due to coding constraints imposed in these regions.356 Phylogenetic analyses. E ORFs were aligned in MEGA X (Kumar, et al. 2018) using the Clustal 357 method. Of the 215 divergent sequences included in the analysis, E ORF could be identified in 178 by 358homology with E ORFs previously annotated in NCBI. Of these 178 E ORFs, 7 were sequences 359 isolated from humans and 96 were from bats; these sequences were selected for analysis. Phylogenetic 360 reconstruction was performed using an unrooted maximum likelihood tree, with gamma distributed 361 variation in rates between branches and 100 bootstraps (also in MEGA X). 362Statistical analyses. Comparison to determine whether there was a statistically significant difference 363 across groups was performed using a 1-way ANOVA in GraphPad Prism. Multi-way comparisons of 364CpG composition between groups were performed using Tukey's multiple comparisons test in 365GraphPad Prism.
