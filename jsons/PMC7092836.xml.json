In humans, syncytin-1 and syncytin-2, two envelope genes from human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) have been existing in the genome at least 25 and 40 million years respectively [5], [6], [7]. They mediate cell\u2013cell fusion in syncytiatrophoblast formation during placental development. Similar genes named as syncytin-A and syncytin-B from murine endogenous retroviruses were also found in mouse genome and proved to be also functional in mouse placental morphogenesis [2], [8]. Other HERV envelope genes such as EnvP (b) in human, syncytin-Ory1 in rabbit and syncytin-Car1 in carnivora had also retained its fusogenic capacity when tested in cell lines [3], [4], [9], [10], [11].",

They are synthesized and capped by an inactive precursor, proteolytic cleavage into surface subunit (SU) and transmembrane subunit (TM) of which normally required for fusogenic activity. The fusion is triggered by receptor binding and may also need low pH. In the post-fusion conformation, the Envs contain the fusion core structure termed six helix bundle composed of three helical N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) regions forming a central trimeric core, and three helical C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) regions packing into the grooves on the surface of the central core.",

It contains the intact open reading frames for the gag, pol, env genes and LTR sequences, and these sequences are located on chromosome 19. The gag and pol genes are contiguous and in the same reading frame. No other intact fish endogenous retrovirus has been identified yet and ZFERV may be limited to zebrafish [14]. In contrast the genes including gag, pol and env genes in HERVs have many copies on different chromosome and normally are not intact to be active. Their Envs encoded by env genes are similar to human and other animal endogenous retroviral Envs such as syncytin [15], [16]. As model organism, it is interesting to understand how the ancestral virus infects zebrafish and becomes part of the genome.",

            "text": "To understand the detailed information of the fusion core, we did molecular modelling of NHR and CHR in ZFERV Env in silicon. The sequence of ZFERV Env was aligned using BLASTp [21]. The results showed that it was the member of HIV-1-like NHR and CHR superfamily while NHR region contained residues 468-505 and CHR region contained residues 535\u2013543. The secondary structure comparison performed with Dali server indicated that the ZFERV Env structure was similar to that of the Env GP2 core domain from the CAS virus, a novel arena virus-like species and core domain of S2 from the human coronavirus NL63 Env (termed spike protein) [22]. The 3D model of ZFERV Env was constructed by Rosetta 3.5 [17] to further investigate how ZFERV Env forms homotrimer. This model fitted very well with an anti-parallel dimer of NHR + CHR complex in ZFERV Env, just like those in HIV-1 gp160 and coronavirus spike protein [23], [24], [25], and provided us putative detailed interactions between NHR and CHR in ZFERV Env.",

The conformational change of N + C protein was tested by acid-induced denaturing (Fig. 3C). The \u03b1-helical structure of the protein was disrupted gradually as pH decreased, appearing to be in a folded state at pH 8.0 and in an unfolded state at pH 4.0.The \u201cS\u201d shaped curve displayed that this unfolding course accord with a two-state model. A neutral condition was enough to make the structure of N + C protein ordered and thermo-stable, which indicated that the ZFERV Env mediated fusion at neutral pH like HIV-1 gp160 but not at low pH like influenza virus hemagglutinin [29], [30].",

Two major fragments with molecular weights of 1319 Da and 2246 Da respectively were identified which can match two regions I462-R471 (calculated MW: 1319 Da) and D478-R498 (calculated MW: 2246 Da) in NHR according to deduction by molecular weight calculation and trypsin digestion site analysis (Fig. 4B). Therefore, after protease K treatment, the three inner NHRs were still retained due to the strong interactions while the three outer CHRs were completely digested, which was consistent with our mode (Fig. 1) and the crystal structure of syncytin-2 [12]. This phenomenon indicated the interaction between NHR and CHR in ZFERV Env might not be as strong as that in HIV-1 gp160 while might be similar to that in syncytin-2. In some type 1 viral Envs (e.g., HIV-1 gp160 and RSV F protein), the length of NHR is almost equal to that of CHR. In contrast, the length of CHR in other type 1 viral Envs (e.g., syncytin-2 and EBOV Gp2) is much shorter than that of NHR. The diversity of CHRs in different viruses might be related to the evolutional properties of the viruses with type 1 Envs, which needs to be further investigated.",

Zebrafish is an excellent developmental model in vertebrates to study such questions because of the presence of ZFERV. ZFERV is the only intact fish endogenous retrovirus identified in zebrafish, which is present in lots varieties of tissues, including the brain, fin regenerates, heart, kidney, olfactory rosettes, and retina [14]. Although most ancient endogenous retrovirus in vertebrates contain many deletions and mutations in their genomes, the ZFERV Env gene transcript could correctly express and the protein might be still physiologically functional in vivo. However, there was not much information on the fusion function and mechanism of ZFERV Env. Here, we disclosed the molecule mechanism of how the ancestor virus enters the host that is mediated by ZFERV Env. Combined biophysical and biochemical methods were used to evaluate the structure of N + C protein in ZFERV Env. Our experiments implicate that N + C protein could form a stable triple-stranded coiled-coil that is the common structure found in other type I viral Envs including syncytin. These results show that ZFERV, frozen about 60\u2013100 million years, still adopts similar mechanism with other viruses that use type I Envs when it enters the host cell suggesting a uniform viral entry structural conformation process during the long-term evolution.",
