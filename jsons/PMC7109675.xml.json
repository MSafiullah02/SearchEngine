JEV is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes and is the causative agent of Japanese encephalitis (JE). The symptoms of JE typically include fever and headache, but other incapacitating manifestations also usually result and frequently involve neurological complications.1 JE has a major impact on public health in eastern and southern Asia, causing 30 000\u201350 000 symptomatic cases and \u223c10 000 deaths annually.2 Recently, JEV has expanded its geographic footprint into previously non-endemic areas and, with several billion people at risk, JE represents an international emerging disease concern in tropical and subtropical regions. Two JEV vaccines are in use in different parts of Asia. However, concerns over the efficacy, safety and cost of available vaccines continue, and a high percentage of people in \u2018at-risk\u2019 regions remain unvaccinated. Although considerable research is ongoing, to date no effective antiviral therapeutic is available to treat JE.",

The 5\u2032/3\u2032-UAR (upstream of AUG region) interaction involves \u223c15 complementary nucleotides, with the 5\u2032 component located just upstream of the AUG region and the 3\u2032 component located between 70 and 90 nucleotides from the 3\u2032 end of the JEV genome.16 Another interaction occurs between a pair of 10 complementary nucleotides, with the 5\u2032 cyclization sequence (CS) located in the coding sequence for the capsid protein at 136\u2013146 nucleotides from the 5\u2032 end of the genome, and the 3\u2032 cyclization sequence, often denoted as 3\u2032CSI (3\u2032 conserved sequence I) located at 104\u2013114 nucleotides from the 3\u2032 end of the genome.16,17 The 3\u2032CSI and its flanking sequence form a region of 22 nucleotides that is very highly conserved across the members of the JEV serocomplex.12,16,18 Deas et al.12 showed that a PPMO designed against the JE serocomplex 3\u2032CSI region was effective in reducing WNV, SLEV and JEV replication in Vero cells, and that the same PPMO produced enhanced survival of mice challenged with a usually lethal dose of WNV. Yoo et al.18 recently showed that a peptide\u2013nucleic acid (PNA) conjugate targeted to the 3\u2032CSI region also inhibited JEV replication in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells. Here we extend those findings against JEV in various types of cultured cells and in a mouse model for JE disease where 60%\u201380% of mice administered a 3\u2032CSI-targeting PPMO were protected against a lethal JEV challenge.",

For determination of the levels of JEV in the brains of mice from the various treatment groups, brain tissue was harvested at 12 h intervals following JEV inoculation. The tissue was homogenized into a 20% suspension in MEM, centrifuged and filter-sterilized. JEV titre was determined by plaque formation on PS cells. The minimum detection limit of the plaque assay was 50 pfu/mL. All animal studies were conducted following the approved protocols of the Institutional Animal Care and Ethics Committee.",

The P93 and P104 PPMOs were designed to interfere with both translation initiation and the 5\u2032-/3\u2032-UAR interaction.

Fluorescence microscopy indicated markedly different levels of uptake by the different cell types, with J774E and Vero cells exhibiting considerably more fluorescence than Neuro2A cells (Figure 4). A quantitative analysis by flow cytometry showed that almost 90% of the each cell type took up PSCR\u2013Fl. Based on the measurements of fluorescence intensity, J774E cells showed the maximum PPMO uptake, followed by Vero cells, while Neuro2A cells showed the least uptake. In relative quantitative terms, 10 \u00b5M PPMO-treated J774E cells showed an \u223c50-fold increase in the MFI compared with the untreated cells. The increase in MFI was 10-fold in the case of Vero cells and \u223c6-fold for Neuro2A cells. This relatively low uptake of PSCR\u2013Fl observed in Neuro2A cells may explain the lower antiviral effect of P10882 in these cells. However, the uptake data do not explain the higher antiviral effect observed for P10882 in Vero cells compared with that in J774E cells.

Nevertheless, several factors encouraged us to carry out this current study. JE often occurs epidemiologically in temporally defined outbreaks, usually in July and August. Further, initial symptoms do overlap for a few days with viraemia.2 Considering the impact of JE on public health, and the lack of effective drugs to treat it, we felt that the 3\u2032CSI-targeted PPMOs, which previously showed considerable antiviral activity against JEV in Vero cells,12 warranted further exploration. The antiviral activity demonstrated by several types of technology that rely on sequence-specific targeting of viral RNA indicates that antisense-mediated strategies have considerable utility as research reagents and as potential therapeutics against flaviviruses.24 It is also possible that a prophylactic treatment for people entering a region where JEV is known to be present would be of value.",

An enhancement in survival of \u223c50%, from \u223c10% in controls to \u223c60% for the 3\u2032CSI PPMO-treated mice, was observed. The authors concluded that the compound showed considerable promise, but that overall toxicity would need to be lower to allow higher dosing and hence perhaps enhanced survival. We observed a similar pattern in our study, with the P10882 PPMO producing a substantial enhancement of survival and reduced virus titres in brain compared with controls, when administered intracerebrally at a dose of 20 mg/kg. However, PPMO administration to uninfected mice at a \u226530 mg/kg dose produced noticeable ill effects or mortality. The peptide component (RXR)4XB of PPMOs is generally acknowledged as necessary for the delivery of therapeutically effective levels of PMOs into cells in vivo.12,13,21,25 However, the peptide has attendant toxicity in vivo as well.12,21 Clearly, the development of a peptide component of PPMOs that results in a wider therapeutic window for systemic dosing would enhance the utility of PPMO technology, and such efforts are apparently in progress.26\u201328 Alternatively, it is possible that formulation of the present (RXR)4XB\u2013PMO would improve its pharmacological properties. In an approach similar to the study here, Yoo et al.18 used a panel of HIV Tat-like peptides conjugated to a PNA targeted against a well-conserved flavivirus sequence in cell culture studies with JEV. Like PPMOs, PNAs interfere with the production of protein from mRNA by sequence-specific steric blocking of RNA as the mechanism of action. They found a Tat-PNA targeted against the top of the JEV 3\u2032 stem\u2013loop to be the most effective, producing a 5- to 10-fold reduction in infectious virus. Relatedly, Kumar et al.29 showed that intracerebral injection of a small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-coding lentivirus or lipid-complexed small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted to a conserved sequence in the envelope-coding RNA protected mice from JEV and WNV infection. We previously demonstrated that a DNAzyme targeting a 27 nucleotide repeat sequence in the 3\u2032-UTR of JEV and delivered intracerebrally protected mice against lethal JEV infection.30 These studies together indicate that compounds targeting viral nucleic acid may be useful to address JEV infection.",

A PPMO against 3\u2032CSI sequence that is highly conserved in members of the DENV serocomplex was found to have effective antiviral activity against DENV-2 infections in AG129 mice.13 The 3\u2032CSI region sequence targeted by P10882 is highly conserved in members of the JEV serocomplex, and with P10882 now proven to be protective against both JEV and WNV infections in vivo it represents a candidate for development as a pan-JEV serocomplex antiviral agent.",

The goal of this study was to explore whether PPMOs could provide antiviral action against JEV infection in the brain. Obviously, intracerebral injection is not a relevant route of administration for human therapeutics, and it has not been established that PPMOs can traverse the blood\u2013brain barrier. However, in natural infections, JEV replicates peripherally prior to invading the brain.2 It may be that PPMO treatment could reduce peripheral virus titres to a level amenable to clearance by the immune system. From here, we hope to study the P10882 PPMO made with alternative peptides or formulation, in older JEV-infected mice, using routes of administration other than intracerebral for both virus and PPMOs, and to more thoroughly evaluate prophylactic and post-infection treatment options.",
