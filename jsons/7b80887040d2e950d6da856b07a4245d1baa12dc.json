The disease is caused by the severe-acute respiratory symptom Coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2) and has a high case fatality rate of up to 4% (2) with more than 170,000 deaths reported currently. Due to a high reproduction number and infectious nature of the disease, tools for rapid testing and evaluation are vital to track and mitigate the spread. Non-contrast chest Computed Tomography (CT) has been useful to detect, quantify severity, and assess progression of the disease. We propose an automated system that can quantify the abnormalities most often seen in COVID-19, i.e., ground glass opacities and consolidations. The system will output regions of abnormality demarcated in a 3D CT scan and output two combined severity measures of the disease: (Percentage of Opacity, Percentage of High Opacity) and (Lung Severity Score, Lung High Opacity Score). The first measure (PO, PHO) indicates the overall disease spread relative to the volume of the lungs, while the second (LSS, LHOS) is a cumulative measure of the extent of involvement for each lung lobe (Fig. 1) .",

The primary features seen on a lung affected by COVID-19 are peripheral focal or multi-focal ground glass opacities, consolidation and crazy-paving patterns. Another study evaluated CT scans of patients tested positive for COVID-19 across 552 hospitals in China (4). They found that 84.4% of patients exhibiting mild symptoms showed CT changes, whereas 94.6% of patients exhibiting severe symptoms showed CT changes. In a study of 121 patients, Bernheim et al showed that CT changes correlated with disease severity, with increasing lung involvement and abnormalities as the disease progressed (10) . A recent radiologist performance study also points to preliminary evidence that radiologists can discriminate COVID-19 from other types of pneumonia (11) . The study showed that seven U.S. and Chinese radiologists were able to identify COVID-19 from other types of viral pneumonia with a median sensitivity of 73% and a median specificity of 93%. The studies so far have been performed on patients either suspected or confirmed to be tested positive of COVID-19, therefore it is too early to state that CT can be used as an effective diagnostic or screening tool for evaluation of COVID-19 in general population. However, most patients with COVID-19 exhibit CT abnormalities and the extent of these changes seem to correlate with disease severity. Recently, Fleischner society provided recommendations for use of chest imaging in evaluation of COVID-19 in regions with resource constraints especially with worsening respiratory status, suspected false negative PCR, and more severe.",

We also compute the Kendall's rank correlation test for COVID-19 positive cases, which considers the distribution of scores across the range of the score. Table 3 . All correlations are statistically significant, demonstrating the system's ability to predict lung severity measures in COVID-19 datasets. The R 2 and standard error of each linear correlation was also computed, to show the linear fit between ground truth and predicted data ( Table 4) Fig 5(c) shows two cases which were identified as outliers due to their PO score differing by more than 20% from the ground truth.

Note that all the markers for abnormalities greater than 0 fall below the line, indicating various levels of consolidation present.

The window level and width are adjusted to 425 and 1500. The annotation task was performed by a team of 25 expert annotators under the supervision of 3 board-certified radiologists. Every dataset was reviewed and corrected by a radiologist for any areas missed or to be removed from the final mask.The lung lobe masks were initialized by a pre-trained segmentation model. The mask follows the lung boundary against the mediastinum and soft tissue chest wall. The lung lobe segmentation mask covers the lung parenchyma from the division of the primary to secondary bronchus onwards. The mask adjusted to lung parenchymal window for best visualization of opacities includes any areas of consolidation, collapse and other abnormalities. The lung lobe annotation was performed by separating the whole lung into three right lobes and two left lobes at the fissure boundaries with different mask labels. A subset of the training dataset of 8087 chest CT was annotated previously.For the ground truth of the abnormality a single label mask included all areas of ground glass opacity and consolidation within both lung fields however pleural effusion was excluded in the mask. For crazy paving pattern the mask excluded normal areas of the lung with precision contouring of the mask.The average time for annotation and review of the lung and lobe masks is 2 hours.",

II-B to compute the geometric center of the lungs and then crop the image with a fixed bounding box of size 384 \u00d7 384 \u00d7 384. For data augmentation, we perturb the image intensity within a random interval[\u221220,20]  and then flip the image in one of the three dimensions by 50% chance. The tensor 3D dimensions are kept in z-y-x order throughout training and inference.We use a UNet (15) resembling architecture with convolutional blocks containing either 1 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 or 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 CNN kernels to deal with the anisotropic image resolutions. The network architecture is illustrated inFig. 5. The 3D input tensor is first fed into a 3D 1 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 convolutional layer followed by batch normalization and LeakyReLU. The features are then propagated to 5 DenseNet blocks(22). For the first two DenseNet blocks, the features are downsampled by a 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 convolution with a stride of 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2. These anisotropic downsampling kernels are designed to preserve the inter-slice resolution of the input tensors. The last 3 DenseNet blocks have isotropic downsampling kernels with the stride of 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2. The input to each decoder block is obtained by concatenating the encoder output features with the same resolution and the features upsampled from the previous decoder. The upsampling kernels are built with transpose convolutional kernels with the sizes and strides same to the corresponding DenseNet blocks. The final network output is derived by projecting the feature maps to 2 feature channels and being activated by the softmax activation. The network parameters are randomly initialized.",

Atypical pneumonia datasets including SARS, MERS, and other viral pneumonia have similar abnormalities as COVID-19(17) and are used as reasonable proxies to complement the COVID-19 training dataset together with CT datasets that include other IDLs that present with GGO and consolidation. These datasets are used in the training dataset to learn the patterns relevant in COVID-19. For the testing set, both the initial annotation and final review was done by a board-certified radiologist.
