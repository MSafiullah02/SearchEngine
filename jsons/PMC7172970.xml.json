The cell surface aminopeptidase N is overexpressed in tumor cells. It is now generally agreed that conversion (degradation) of ANG III that causes high blood pressure to the hexapeptide ANG IV is aminopeptidase N dependent [62]. Intestine brush-border cells present a high concentration of aminopeptidase N that plays a role in the final digestion of peptides generated from hydrolysis of proteins by gastric and pancreatic proteases. Human CD13/APN is the receptor for coronaviruses; thus, its inhibitors might protect again SARS [63]. Our data are in concert with previous finding on reduction of cell surface CD13/APN expression in the phagocytic cells by 1,25-(OH)2D3\n[64] and suggest 1,25-(OH)2D3 as the potential inhibitor of CD13/APN expression. Interestingly, in our experiment 1,25-(OH)2D3 simultaneously increased the expression of transcription factor c-Maf (Table 5), which was shown to suppress the CD13/APN expression (85\u201395% reduction) in human immature myeloblastic cells [65].

ACE is a carboxypeptidase that hydrolyzes the amino acid peptide angiotensin I into the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. It was reported that angiotensin II stimulates angiogenesis in vivo, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors block angiogenesis [66]. In addition to inducing vasoconstriction, angiotensin II increases blood pressure by a variety of physiological actions, including renal salt and water retention. ACE may affect blood pressure through the production of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II and the inactivation of the vasodilator bradykinin. ACE inhibitors block the formation of angiotensin II and have been used to treat hypertension and heart failure [67]. ACE null mice have low blood pressure and the inability to concentrate urine [68]. Further, it has been reported that vitamin D3 supplementation reduces blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension [69], which may be in part due to its ability to down-regulate ACE.",

Lipophilic molecules easily cross the cell membrane via transcellular diffusion. Hydrophilic molecules, if not recognized by a carrier, traverse the epithelial barrier via the paracellular pathway, which is severely restricted by the presence of tight junctions. Historically, a simplified view of this absorptive process was that transcellular movement of nutrients and water via specific pumps, transporters, and channels would account for absorption, while an impermeable tight junction seal adjoining epithelial cells for the requisite barrier function. It has now become clear that transjunctional solute movement occurs in a regulated fashion, and that its regulation may be coupled to transcellular absorptive events. Thus epithelial solute transport and tight junction barrier function have to be viewed as related coordinated events [73].",

Tight junctions are crucial in maintaining the polarized phenotype and the vectorial transport functions of epithelial cells. They are also a specialized membrane microdomains that might function as a molecular platform involved in cell signaling, vesicle protein docking, actin organization, and cell polarity in epithelial cells. Each particle of the tight junction strand is composed of transmembrane proteins and cytoplasmic plaque proteins connected to the actin cytoskeleton. Occludins, claudins, and the junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) are the three classes of transmembrane proteins localized to the tight junctions.

The increased tight junction permeability and/or selectivity, regulated by 1,25-(OH)2D3, could route Ca2+ absorption through the tight junction-regulated paracellular pathway in the intestinal epithelia. Our proposal is in agreement with published data on the 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulated increase of tight junction conductance and increased paracellular Ca2+, Na+, Rb+, and mannitol transport in enterocyte-like cell line Caco-2, while no significant contribution of the Ca2+-ATPase-mediated transcellular pathway to overall transepithelial Ca2+ transport was detected [76]. The evidence has accumulated since late 80th for in vitro intestinal model for Ca2+ and Pi transport [77] and recently for Ca2+ transport in Caco-2 cells [78] that 1,25-(OH)2D3 enhanced both cell-mediated active and passive paracellular ion movement.",

Murine models have shown that IL-18 has both antiangiogenic and antitumor effects particularly in combination with IL-2 or IL-12 and also induces the high levels of IFN-\u03b3 secretion [54]. In a new gene therapy approach for treatment of osteosarcoma, recombinant IL-18 was proposed for use in combination with plasmids encoding the IL-12 [80]. IL-15 is involved in the development of natural killer (NK) cells that can spontaneously kill tumor cell lines in vitro [81]. The loss of CD59 offered a selective advantage for development of breast cancers, resulting in more aggressive tumors [55].

Our data showed that 1,25-(OH)2D3 strongly down-regulated enzymes involved in angiogenesis which is mandatory for tumor progression: CD13/aminopeptidase N and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) or kininase II. The cell surface aminopeptidase N (APN/CD13) was overexpressed in tumor cells. However, potent, selective, and, particularly, non-cytotoxic inhibitors of this protein were lacking. Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) hydrolyzed the amino acid peptide angiotensin I into the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. It was reported that angiotensin II stimulates angiogenesis in vivo, and ACE inhibitors inhibit angiogenesis [66]. Our data suggest 1,25-(OH)2D3 as the potential inhibitor of both CD13/APN and ACE expression which also can contribute to 1,25-(OH)2D3 anticancer activity.

We showed that 1,25-(OH)2D3 modulated the expression of different classes of genes in rat intestine, not only those directly involved in the absorption of nutrients in small intestine but also genes involved in immune response and angiogenesis. Since many genes may not have a VDRE in the promoter region, their regulation by 1,25-(OH)2D3 could be indirect through other proteins/factors expressed early in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 or through increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration.",
