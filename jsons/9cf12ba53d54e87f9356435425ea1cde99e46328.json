Our model contains only one fitting parameter, which we determine from the data supplied by the world health organisation for the total number of cases and new cases each day. We find that our model provides a surprisingly good fit to the currently-available data. It predicts that the disease will run its full course over six to seven months, starting from the date on which the world health organisation provided the first 'Situation report' (21 January 2020 -day 1). The disease may be expected to infect approximately 24% of the global population, i.e. about 1.83 billion people, taking approximately 86 million lives. Unless drastic new interventions become possible, the global number of new cases is predicted to peak on day 129 (about the middle of May 2020), with an estimated 65 million new cases per day. Since our simple model fits the available global data so well, we suggest that the measures being taken so far to contain the pandemic may be ineffective in curbing the global spread of the virus. As such, the efficacy of these measures should be more carefully weighed against their impact on the world economy.",

The first equation simply updates the total number of cases by setting it equal to the previous total number of cases, plus the number of new cases. Here the factor of 1/z 0 has been introduced for convenience, to ensure that the proportionality constant \u03b1 remains close to unity. In the second equation the number of new cases is assumed to be proportional to the previous number of new cases multiplied by the previous number of susceptible people. The third equation keeps track of the global population by subtracting the estimated number of people who have died each day, based on the fraction c. Figure 1 shows a comparison of the data with the model, as well as a forecast made up to the 200th day. As we see in Table 1 ). The forecast made in Figure 1 (b) (corresponding to the last row of Table 1 ), predicts that approximately a quarter of the worlds population, i.e. \u2248 1.83/7.7 = 0.24, would have had COVID-19 by the 200th day. The peak of the pandemic is expected to occur on day 129, when about 65 million daily new cases can be expected. We also predict that by the beginning of August 2020, hardly any new cases should occur; however, the total number of lives lost by then could be as high as 86 million.",

It shows that, as more data is used, there seems to be a general upward trend in \u03b1, until day 64. At the same time the increase in \u03b1 is not monotonic, since \u03b1 appears to oscillate. While we are not sure, at this stage, whether \u03b1 is converging, or whether it will continue to increase (or decrease) generally in the future, we note that the variations in \u03b1 and the predictions made by the model, are relatively small over the last two weeks. Thus it seems like, as more data is used to calculate \u03b1, the variations will become smaller -assuming that there is no systematic errors in the current or future data (see Discussion).",

In developing countries such as South Africa there is also a relatively large percentage of people with compromised immunity, due to the high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and this also could result in the coronavirus having a much larger impact than our model of the current global data shows. Another factor to consider is the reliability of the WHO data itself. At present, this data is probably the most accurate we will ever have. However, as things progress, there will be a much greater chance of unreported cases, since people are now being instructed to contact the hospitals only if they experience severe symptoms.

So far these measures have included enforced quarantine, which has led to a severe slowdown in economic activity and manufacturing production, principally due to declining consumption and disrupted global supply chains 10 . (As an example of the severity of the slowdown in production, several major car manufacturers are gradually halting production in major manufacturing hubs throughout the developed world 11 .) This decline, coupled with the associated economic uncertainty, has had knock on effects in the form of historically unprecedented stock market falls 12 . Although the stock market is more of an indicator of the future value of the profits of listed corporations, their collapsed share prices could trigger severe financial crises because of a spike in bankruptcies. (The debt of US corporations is the highest it has ever been 13 .) The inevitable loss of jobs will also lead to an inability to pay bills and mortgages, increased levels of crime, etc. In principle, such a major decline in economic conditions could also result in a large-scale loss of life, which should be weighed carefully against the direct effects that the unimpeded global spread COVID-19 could have.",
