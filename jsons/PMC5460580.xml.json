When a new virus is identified, PCR detection of viral nucleic acid plays an important role, and lack of early detection of emerging diseases may affect the timely diagnosis of the disease. In the present study, diagnostic assays were developed for some other novel viruses such as Malsoor and bat AdV discovered in India. The disease-causing potential of these viruses in humans is not known. These are novel viruses identified for the first time in Rousettus bats whose prevalence is also unknown. Looking at the close relatedness of Malsoor virus to SFTS and Heartland, which cause lethal disease in humans, it is essential to study the prevalence of this virus in potentially risky areas of India12. Similarly, it has been known that variant of AdV also has the potential to cause infection in humans11. The developed diagnostic assays have a good specificity and sensitivity and can be used in rapid screening of the bats specimens for Malsoor and bat AdV.",
