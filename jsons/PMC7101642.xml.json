Puumala virus infection is usually either asymptomatic or causes a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. The incidence in Finland is 19/100,000. The mortality rate is low (0.1\u20130.4%) [1]. The most common signs and symptoms are fever, headache, myalgia, back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms, often followed by an oliguric phase with proteinuria and hematuria, and later a polyuric phase. Transient visual impairment (myopia) is a pathognomonic sign. Hemorrhagic manifestations are present in about 10% of cases. However, mild mucosal bleeding is very common [1]. Spontaneous recovery usually takes place in 2\u20133 weeks [2].",

We describe two cases of PUU-associated HPS, in which administration of intravenous corticosteroids combined with continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) was followed by rapid clinical improvement.

The syndrome progresses very rapidly from interstitial pulmonary edema to a clinical picture resembling adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The alveolar infiltrates are typically central or bibasilar, and pleural effusion is common [12]. The hantaviruses are not cytopathic, and the increased capillary permeability is likely caused by immunologic factors [13]. In pathological specimens of HPS-afflicted lungs, intra-alveolar edema and interstitial lymphoid cell infiltration are observed, the pneumocytes are preserved, and neutrophils are notably scarce [14, 15]. The endothelial cells are also largely intact, and the alveolar walls are thickened due to extravasation [16]. Activation of T-lymphocytes and cytokine production appear to be involved in both HPS and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome [13,17]. Terajima et al. [18] demonstrated that at the onset of pulmonary edema, HPS patients have abundant viremia which clears rapidly after the resolution of fever, while respiratory distress may persist.",

Cortisol acts in concert with catecholamines to maintain vascular tone and endothelial integrity, and it suppresses the inflammatory cascade by down-regulating the production of proinflammatory molecules [21]. Animal studies on the efficacy of corticosteroids in acute lung injury have produced mixed results [22, 23]. The American\u2013European consensus conference on ARDS stated that corticosteroids are not generally useful in the early management of sepsis and ARDS [19]. Early or prophylactic use of high-dose corticosteroid therapy in septicemia and ARDS may even be harmful [24]. The consensus conference acknowledged, however, that corticosteroids may be of value in treating certain ARDS variants [19]. Currently, there is no universally accepted drug treatment for the high permeability edema associated with acute lung injury/ARDS in humans [20]. An overaggressive inflammatory response may be an important factor in the outcome of ARDS patients [25]. Late corticosteroid treatment in sustained lung injury has been shown to inhibit proinflammatory activity and to improve lung function and possibly outcome [26].",

The patient with Dobrava virus-associated HPS reported by Sch\u00fctt et al. [6] received both CVVHDF and prolonged mechanical ventilation (25 days), and eventually recovered. In a series of 16 Andes virus-associated HPS cases in Chile, five patients, all of whom were among the survivors, received corticosteroid treatment along with supportive treatment, but the efficacy of corticosteroid treatment could not be determined due to the low number of cases [27]. In the series of 14 HPS cases described by Hallin et al. [15], antimicrobial and supportive treatment was given. The two survivors who required mechanical ventilation were extubated after 5 days and made a full recovery.",
