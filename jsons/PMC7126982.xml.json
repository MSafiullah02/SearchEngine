Although coronavirus affects both the respiratory and intestinal tract in animals, this is the first report to show the presence of active viral replication in the small and large intestine of patients with SARS. Despite a relatively normal endoscopic and microscopic appearance, the presence of coronavirus in the large and small bowel can be shown by both electronic microscopy and viral culture. There was also evidence of active viral replication in intestinal cells with accumulation of virus inside endoplasmic reticulum and possibly leaving of virus from the apical membrane of the enterocytes. Moreover, small bowel biopsy specimens obtained from postmortem examination, which is usually performed a few days after the death of patients, still yielded viable SARS-CoV. In contrast, SARS is associated with epithelial cell proliferation and an increase in macrophages in the lung.21 It is suggested that cytokine dysregulation plays an instrumental role in the determination of severity of lung disease. However, the current study shows that there was only minimal disruption of intestinal cells by the virus despite the tropism. Given the minimal destruction of enterocytes, diarrhea associated with SARS-CoV infection may be more related to proteins or toxins produced during viral replication than malabsorption or inflammation.",

All other organ tissues obtained during autopsy did not have viable virus recovered. By molecular diagnostic method, the detection rates of viral RNA from stool and nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were comparable in our study. On the other hand, our detection rate of viral RNA in nasopharyngeal aspirate was lower than the 32% reported by Peiris et al.14 The difference may be accounted for by the differences in primer sequences and the timing of obtaining these specimens. Despite this, all of these data favor the intestinal tropism of SARS-CoV. From the virologic point of view, this intestinal tropism is unusual because most diarrhea-associated viruses (e.g., rotavirus, calicivirus, enteric adenovirus, Norwalk virus) are nonenveloped. Viruses without envelope are generally more resistant and have a better chance of survival in the intestinal tract. The intestinal tropism of SARS-CoV raises the question of whether this virus is more resistant to disinfection than other enveloped viruses.",

Given the many potential confounding factors complicating diarrhea in these patients with prolonged hospitalization, this association should be interpreted with caution. However, routine bacteriologic culture and detection of C. difficile toxin failed to identify any other culprit for diarrhea. Further studies are necessary to determine whether intestinal viral load has any correlation with enteric manifestation and, more importantly, the clinical outcome of these patients.",

Peiris et al. reported that the virus can be detected by RT-PCR in the stool samples of all 20 patients with positive nasopharyngeal aspirates at day 10 after onset of symptoms.14 At day 21, 67% of these initially positive patients still had viral RNA detected in stool samples. Our data further showed that virus can be detected by PCR in stool for up to 73 days from symptom onset in a patient, which may have substantial implications on infection control. Although viable virus is not recovered from stool samples, the question of whether stool remains a potential source of the virus in recovering or even recovered patients deserves further evaluation. It is also imperative that strict precautions be used in handling the excreta of these patients in addition to routine droplet and formite precautions to minimize the risk of viral transmission. With the high viral load in the intestinal tract, the potential risk to the endoscopist performing colonoscopy in patients with SARS is considerable if barrier precaution is not strictly enforced.",
