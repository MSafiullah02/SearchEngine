            "text": "Since the initial description of foamy virus (FV) in rhesus monkey kidney cells in 1954 [3], such viruses have been isolated from several animal species, including numerous NHP species. The prevalence of FVs in naturally infected animals is generally high, but varies widely according to species [2]. Among NHP populations, SFV seroprevalence can reach up to 75\u2013100% in adults [2]. In African green monkey and macaques, oral mucosa tissue is an important site for viral replication, explaining why foamy viral RNA is found at a high concentration in the saliva of such primates [4\u2022\u2022]. Saliva-based means of transmission, such as bites, have been thus strongly suggested. Infection by SFV itself does not seem to cause any disease in infected NHPs, but studies have not been conducted to address this question specifically. However, when considering co-infections in macaques, SFV can increase the pathogenicity of simian immunodeficiency virus [5].",

Phylogenetic studies demonstrated that this virus originated from the East African chimpanzee subspecies (Pan troglodytes schweinfurtii). This strain is now considered to be the \u2018prototype foamy virus\u2019 (PFV). However, its exact origin remains unclear (in vivo cross-species transmission from a chimpanzee to the African patient, or cell culture contamination) [7]. In the 1970/80s, several papers showed conflicting results on the presence of SFV in human populations and in different patients [8, 9]. These findings reflected the high percentage of non-specific serological reactivity and the lack of specific confirmatory tests at that time.",

            "text": "In 1995, based on specific serological and molecular assays, the first clear evidence of SFV in Humans was reported among 3 laboratory and monkey house personnel [10\u2022\u2022]. Since then, other groups have reported similar findings in a series of workers occupationally exposed to NHPs in the USA and Canada and more recently in personnel from zoos or primate centers in Gabon and China [8]. Infection by SFV in a more natural setting was then demonstrated in villagers from Cameroon [11]. They were mostly hunters who reported direct contacts with blood and/or body fluids from wild NHPs. We extended such studies into different areas and populations of this Central African country and found the presence of SFV infection in at least 50 persons [12\u2022\u2022]. The great majority of them (Bantus or Pygmies) were men who had been bitten by an ape (mostly gorillas but also chimpanzees) or a small monkey (mostly Cercopithecus nictitans) during hunting activities. A recent report from Gabon confirmed such frequent cross-species transmission in hunters after severe bites from mostly gorilla [13]. Infected women were also recently found in the Democratic Republic of Congo [14]. In South and Southeast Asian countries, SFV zoonotic infection has also been detected in various contexts of interspecies contact including \u2018monkey temple\u2019 workers, pet owners and people living around free-ranging macaques in South and Southeast Asia [15]. It is interesting to note that the Human/NHP interface in Asia differs greatly from that in Africa [16]. Human and macaques sympatry in Southeast Asia dates back as far as 25,000 years. Human-macaque commensalism is frequent in many monkey temples of these regions each year putting a very large number of persons, including tourists, at risk for macaques bites [17]. Indeed, human subjects in some South Asian countries came into contact with rhesus macaques mostly in the context of their daily lives, sharing a geographical area that is the \u2018home range\u2019 of both primate populations [16]. Such frequent interactions can lead to possible viral interspecies transmission. The situation is very different in central Africa where bush-meat hunting (including Apes such as gorillas and chimpanzees) is the major risk factor associated with SFV interspecies transmission [12\u2022\u2022]. Furthermore, in Central Africa, the number of contacts between humans (mostly hunters and their wives and butchers) and potentially infected NHPs has probably greatly increased during the last century. This is believed to be due to increased hunting activities, resulting from a combination of urban demand for bush-meat, greater access to NHP habitats provided in part by logging roads, easier accessibility to fire arms, an increase in populations living in forest areas, and the associated increase in local food needs [2].",

However, some cell lines as well as primary cells of the myeloid or lymphoid lineage can remain chronically infected [20, 21]. In NHPs, SFV is latent in blood cells and replicates in the superficial epithelial layer of the oral mucosa [4\u2022\u2022, 22], which explains the mode of transmission of SFV to humans, mainly through bites [12\u2022\u2022]. Viral genomes in the buccal swab usually reflects those found in the blood [23]. In humans, SFV is also present in PBMCs and saliva. However, no active replication, as monitored by SFV RNA, has been detected in the PBMCs nor in the saliva [24].",

            "text": "SFV genomes display a high evolutionary conservation among all the species infected and SFV genetic variability within one infected animal is very low over time (<1% variation over 13 years) [28]. This genetic stability might be explained by the long co-evolution with their host [29\u2022] and their subsequent efficient adaptation. SFV genetic stability could also prevent or delay infection of new hosts as molecular changes may be required to infect cells from a different species and/or evade host-specific immune responses [30]. Genetic stability was also found in SFV-infected humans, with less than 1% divergence in the nucleotide sequence over several years [13, 24]. Several groups also reported genetic modifications including mutations in the Bet accessory gene [25, 31], deletion in the U3 sequence of the LTR which improves FV replication in vitro [31, 32] and deletions in the Tas sequence, which might be linked with the chronicity of the infection [31]. However, most of these modifications are not a unifying trait of zoonotic strains, and can also be found in NHP or experimentally infected animals [31]. This suggests that viral strains remain mainly stable, even decades after cross-species transmission. This is probably related to the apparent low level of SFV replication in infected humans, which could be linked with their efficient immune control.",

Some chimpanzees infected by SFVcpz strains were co-infected with SFV from colobus monkeys [33], or cercopithecus monkeys [34]. More frequently, chimpanzees and macaques can harbor distinguishable SFVcpz and SFVmac strains respectively, likely the result of multiple independent infections that accumulate with age [16, 35, 36]. SFVcpz infection appears to first occur via vertical transmission but is followed in adult life by the acquisition of further infections, possibly stemming from aggressive interactions [35]. In some of these studies, as well as in a recent one, some SFV appears to be recombinant strains [34, 36, 37]. We, and others, have found different clones of SFV in single individuals [12\u2022\u2022, 16, 24], suggesting a co-infection with multiple SFV strains. Whether they were acquired at a single time or through several contacts with NHP is not known.",

In vitro, SFVs were first thought to be low interferon-inducers [38] but this actually depends on the cell type. Indeed, we found that SFVs are efficiently sensed by human hematopoietic cells and induce the production of high levels of IFN-I [39]. The main producers of IFN-I in the blood are the plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which detect SFV genome after uptake of SFV particles, through the endosomal toll-like receptor 7 [39]. In culture systems, the addition of type I IFN impairs SFV replication, suggesting that interferon-inducible genes might be involved in the control of SFV replication (Figure 2A and B):-Apolipoprotein B-editing catalytic polypeptide-like subunit (APOBEC) enzymes are a family of antiviral cytidine deaminases that act on the negative strand DNA produced by the viral reverse transcriptase, resulting in G-to-A mutations in the viral genome, with potential deleterious consequences. However, viruses often produce proteins that counteract cellular defense systems. FV Bet protein has been shown to prevent APOBEC action [40, 41, 42, 43]. Despite the action of Bet, it was reported that SFV genomes found in humans displayed some G-to-A mutations [24, 44]. Matsen et al. found that the frequence and the type of hypermutations were different in humans and macaques, with a majority of hypermutations leading to stop codons in humans, suggesting active restriction of the infecting strain in humans and not only passive acquisition of previously mutated strain [45\u2022].\n",

They act in a species-specific manner: PFV and SFVmac are restricted by TRIM5\u03b1 from most New World monkeys, but not from other primates including humans.

This is further supported by the fact that antibodies titers in feces of chimpanzees infected with SFV are inversely correlated with SFV viral load [34]. However, very few data are available concerning the adaptative immune response to SFV in humans. Antibodies against SFV are detected in the blood of infected individuals and were also found in saliva and urine samples in four SFV-infected individuals tested. However, antibody titers were lower than in infected chimpanzees, which could be linked to lower levels of SFV replication in humans [54]. Neutralization of SFV by sera from three SFVagm-infected individuals was reported in 1983 and 1997 [55, 56].",

The future of SFV emergence in humans remains an open question. However, the current increase in NHP-to-human contacts (in part due to hunting activities and animal handling) may favor such cross-species transmission [2]. Furthermore, other factors such as SFV co-infection with HIV, already reported in Cameroon [60], may increase the risk of SFV pathogenicity and will require further investigation. Nevertheless, any prediction concerning viral emergence remains very difficult and hazardous, as recently exemplified by Ebola and MERS coronavirus outbreaks in West Africa and Saudi Arabia respectively [61]. In this regard, intensive research on mechanisms of the first steps of viral emergence should be further developed.",

(A) SFV life cycle starts with infection of a new cell by SFV particles containing RNA and/or DNA, decapsidation of the viral genome, reverse transcription of RNA genomes and integration of viral DNA into cellular DNA. Cellular activation of the internal promoter induces tas and bet transcription. The transactivator Tas then activates a second promoter located in the long-terminal repeat, which induces the synthesis of the Gag, Pol and Env structural proteins. After assembling, viral particles bud essentially from the endoplasmic reticulum, with a late reverse-transcription step giving rise to both DNA and RNA particles. (B) SFV is detected by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (not exclusively) which triggers IFN-I production. Several antiviral factors that can be induced by IFN-I are active against SFV. TRIM5\u03b1 are antiviral proteins that prevent SFV decapsidation [50]. Apolipoprotein B-editing catalytic polypeptide-like subunit (APOBEC) enzymes act on the negative strand DNA produced by the viral reverse transcriptase, resulting in G-to-A mutations in the viral genome, with potential deleterious consequences. FV Bet protein has been shown to partially prevent APOBEC action [40, 41, 42, 43]. N-Myc interactor (NMI) as well as a member of the interferon-induced protein (IFP) family, IFP35, can inhibit the replication of the prototype and the bovine FV respectively, by direct interaction with the viral transactivator Tas [46, 47]. Tetherin is known to block many different types of enveloped viruses by tethering the budding virus at the cell membrane and is also efficient to prevent FV release [48, 49].",
