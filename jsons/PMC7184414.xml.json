Specifically, generational narratives have been applied to explain a variety of social and economic phenomena surrounding this pandemic. From what we have seen, this rhetoric and the narratives that it engenders has several themes (Table 1 provides examples of these themes and prototypical media headlines that represent them). First, there have been attempts to suggest that COVID-19 is \u201cbringing out\u201d (assumed) generational differences. Such narratives essentially highlight the behavioral consequences of enacting generational stereotypes, including hoarding among \u201cBaby Boomers\u201d (Helfenbein, 2020; Tyeson, 2020), the need to curtail the selfishness of \u201cGeneration Me\u201d to stop the spread of the virus (Pearson, 2020), and looking to members of \u201cGeneration X\u201d for tips about how to socially isolate oneself from others (Steiner, 2020).",

For example, owing to the higher observed mortality rates associated with older age groups, COVID-19 has been variously labeled as \u201cthe Boomer doomer,\u201d \u201cthe Boomer pruner,\u201d and \u201cthe Boomer remover,\u201d across various social media platforms (e.g., Whalen, 2020). While seemingly benign, these labels have been accompanied by calls for older people and those who are \u201cnot productive\u201d to step aside to benefit future generations (i.e., literally, to accept death in service of the economy; Fisher, 2020). Others have likewise noted that COVID-19 is leading to a new generational divide (Foroohar, 2020), with speculation of impending generational warfare as a result (Pancevski et al., 2020). Likewise, it has been suggested that concerns about contracting COVID-19 fall out along generational lines (Penn, 2020), as do lines of intergenerational communication about the virus and its transmission (Peterson, 2020; Pariser, 2020b).",

Notably, and hinting at an opposing process, there has also been speculation of increased divorce rates stemming from the same process of social isolation (Landsverk, 2020). This new generation has already been informally dubbed in various ways, including \u201cGeneration Crown\u201d (a play on \u201cCorona\u201d; Frometa, 2020), \u201cCoronials,\u201d \u201cQuaranteens\u201d (a play on \u201cquarantine\u201d; Greep, 2020), and \u201cIllenials\u201d (a portmanteau of \u201cill\u201d and \u201cMillennials\u201d; Starcasm, 2020). Relatedly, there has been speculation that \u201cZ\u201d in \u201cGeneration Z\u201d actually stands for \u201cZoom\u201d (a video conferencing application favored for virtual meetings; Lorenz, Griffith, & Isaac, 2020). More importantly, perhaps, people have likewise begun to speculate about the future behaviors of those who are currently growing up at this time, as shaped by this pandemic (i.e., the longstanding consequences of patterns of frugality, caution, handwashing, lack of face touching, social distancing habits, etc.; McGonigal, 2020).",

Likewise, members of existing younger generations are being classified as particularly well adept at working remotely, with some speculating that nearly universal moves toward working from home to curtail the further spread of the virus satisfy their (assumed) need for such flexibility (Roose, 2020; Withane, 2020). There has also been speculation that the careers of members of \u201cGeneration X\u201d will be particularly affected by COVID-19 (Fabbiano, 2020). Moreover, there is speculation about the fallout of COVID-19 for the retirement of \u201cBaby Boomers\u201d (Novack, 2020), and whether members of \u201cGeneration Z\u201d will be less likely to contract COVID-19 at work, because they are least likely to engage in physical contact with their coworkers (i.e., compared with members of other generations; Lepore, 2020).",

First, although the rhetoric surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic is being used to intensify intergenerational conflict in some respects, at the same time, there is also anecdotal evidence for intergenerational support emerging from this pandemic (e.g., younger people helping older people with shopping, Gulland, 2020; grandparents watching younger children so that their parents can work, however ill-advised, McAdams, 2020). Second, and more to our point here, there are emerging attempts to label the effects of COVID-19 in generational and generationalist terms (Rauvola, Rudolph, & Zacher, 2019). This comes both in the form of differentiating the consequences of COVID-19 for various (assumed) generational groups (e.g., speculating about differential effects of COVID-19 for \u201cBaby Boomers\u201d vs. \u201cMillennials\u201d), and to ascribe characteristics to a new (assumed) \u201cCOVID-19 Generation.\u201d Whereas the former behavior reflects the typical sensemaking process that we see with existing generational rhetoric, the latter behavior is largely speculative about how COVID-19 will affect future generations. The speculation around the assumed generational consequences of COVID-19 is the particular issue that we take up here. Specifically, we argue that such speculation presents a variety of problems, which we will discuss next.",

From this, the \u201csimilarly aged people\u201d component of the substantive definition is termed a \u201ccohort effect\u201d\u2014which is simply delineated by the year in which people are born (e.g., the \u201ccohort\u201d of people born in 2000). Cohort effects (i.e., differences in attitudes, values, or behaviors that can be tied to birth year differences) are typically taken as evidence for the influence of generational differences. For example, taking the birth year as an index of one\u2019s generational membership (e.g., the assumption that those born in 20XX are members of \u201cthe COVID-19 Generation\u201d) represents a cohort-based definition of a generation.",

On the one hand, age effects are delineated in terms of the time elapsed since one\u2019s birth, and are typically indexed by chronological age (e.g., 20-year-olds). Age effects are typically taken as evidence for the influence of developmental processes, for example, patterns of age-graded personality change and development across adulthood (Nye & Roberts, 2019; Roberts & Mroczek, 2008). On the other hand, period effects are delineated by the current year (e.g., 2020). Period effects are typically taken as evidence for the influence of contemporaneous time, including the role that important current events play (e.g., economic conditions, national conflicts, one-off events, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic) in shaping attitudes, values, and behaviors.",

If period is held constant, any observed variability in these outcomes could be due to either age or cohort effects. For example, assume that we conduct a cross-sectional survey, sampling from a variety of ages and cohorts, but holding period (i.e., year of data collection) constant. In this case, period = age + cohort (e.g., 2020period = 20age + 2000cohort).

Whereas it could be argued that the resulting economic impact of this pandemic will disproportionately affect marginalized populations (e.g., the poor) and specific sectors of the workforce (e.g., those in precarious work arrangements, those in \u201csystem-relevant\u201d occupations, self-employed workers), COVID-19 will have far-reaching effects on all workers across all sectors and strata. Although at this point it is difficult to say what the long-term societal impacts of COVID-19 will be, it is safe to say that any divisions that do emerge will not be along generational lines (e.g., the impact could emerge as socioeconomic differences; Muro, Maxim, & Whiton, 2020). For instance, it is possible that employees working for small and medium-sized businesses will be more severely impacted by the pandemic than employees of large organizations (i.e., with resulting effects on individuals\u2019 attitudes, values, and behavior), but it is unlikely that these effects will differ meaningfully across \u201cgenerations.\u201d",

As such, we conclude here by offering some suggestions for researchers to consider questions that are actually of relevance now (see also Van Bavel et al., 2020, for research suggestions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in social and behavioral sciences more broadly). For instance, the need for rapidly deployed, mass work-from-home policies leads to a variety of interesting possibilities, particularly for researchers who study the interface between work and nonwork, including family and caregiving (e.g., Shockley, 2020). Related to this, it would be particularly important to study how workers in different sectors and occupations suffer disproportionately from this crisis (Gambrell, 2020), especially those that do not have the possibility to work from home (including \u201csystem-relevant\u201d occupations, such as doctors, nurses, and public safety officers) or who work in precarious and/or unsafe jobs (e.g., Winkie, 2020).

It will also be interesting to understand longer-term potentials for various positive effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on workplaces and interpersonal relationships at work, for example, the increased adoption of \u201cwork from home\u201d and related time-and-place flexibility policies (e.g., blended work; Van Yperen & Wortler, 2017), the development of enhanced social support among coworkers, as well as increased appreciation for \u201csystem-relevant\u201d occupations.",

In order to do so, instead of thinking in terms of the generational implications of COVID-19, we would strongly encourage researchers to adopt a life-span developmental perspective on this phenomenon, which focuses on normative age-graded influences (e.g., general increases in emotion regulation abilities with age), normative history-graded influences (e.g., epi- and pandemics), and non-normative or idiosyncratic influences (e.g., divorce, unemployment) on developmental outcomes (see Baltes, 1987; Rudolph & Zacher, 2017).",

For example, it has been speculated that older workers are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of COVID-19 and would especially benefit from paid sick leave policies to curtail the spread of the virus (Ghilarducci, 2020). Another example would be to examine antecedents (e.g., digital competency, emotional stability) and consequences (e.g., occupational well-being, career success) for younger people who successfully manage the school-to-career transition during the pandemic. Overall, it would be interesting to examine how the current pandemic influences the experiences and behavior of workers, not only depending on their chronological age, but also other individual differences (e.g., education, health status, personality) and work-related characteristics (e.g., type of employment, ability to work remotely, organizational support).",

We hope that our cautionary note motivates all of those concerned with work, aging, and retirement to consider the broader picture of COVID-19 and what it means for individuals and workplaces, rather than focusing on, or broadly speculating about, the generational and generationalized implications thereof. We think there is a great opportunity for researchers, organizations, and practitioners to work together to address the challenges facing all workers as we all navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. We challenge each of these constituents to advance such efforts without invoking unnecessary generational framings.",
