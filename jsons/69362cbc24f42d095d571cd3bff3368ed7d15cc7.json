However, the multitude of challenges presented by the pandemic may also pose a significant threat to our psychological health. 1 Individuals are facing a panoply of stressors including: serious illness, bereavement, social distancing, and unemployment. The consequences of these stressors for mental health will not be uniform, rather they will be influenced by a range of modifiable and non-modifiable factors. Understanding these factors will be critical in determining who is at greatest risk of mental health difficulties and potential approaches to intervention. We report here cross-sectional findings from a community cohort study designed to capture both the mental health sequela of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the modifiable and non-modifiable explanatory factors associated with adverse mental health outcomes. Our focus is on the immediate consequences for mental health, as reported during the first 4-6 weeks of social distancing measures being introduced in the UK.",

            "text": "In keeping with its recent emergence, much remains unknown about COVID-19 and its consequences. However, the expectation is that the consequences for mental health will be profound and far reaching. 1 Evidence on the impact of the pandemic on people living in China attests to this possibility. For example, one study reported the prevalence of depression and anxiety in medical staff to be over 50% and 44% respectively. 2 Similarly, a study with a general population sample during Level 1 of the epidemic (classified as a 'significant' emergency) revealed that greater than 70% of participants reported moderate or high psychological symptoms of obsessive compulsion, interpersonal sensitivity, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism. 3 The experience of previous pandemics also suggests that significant mental health consequences are probable. During the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak, for example, untoward psychological effects occurred rapidly: with symptoms of anxiety and anger evident after brief isolation periods of 2 weeks. 4 Similarly, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome epidemic was associated with a 31% increase in suicide amongst the over 65s in Hong Kong. 5 Preliminary evidence from the UK suggests that these experiences may be replicated here. For example, two online surveys conducted in the first week after social distancing measures were introduced, highlighted some early concerns. 1 One survey was conducted with people with lived experience of mental health problems and stakeholders (n=2198), and the other a nationally representative sample of the general population (n=1099). Both cohorts were asked about their concerns regarding the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although no validated assessments of mental health were undertaken, a common theme for both cohorts was concern about increasing levels of anxiety, and the role of social distancing measures and well-being of family members in contributing to such anxiety. Similarly, a qualitative study examining the mental health impact of social distancing measures suggested that deleterious effects were evident within 5-12 days of such measures being in place. 6 So it would seem likely that we should brace ourselves for a significant increase in mental health difficulties associated with the pandemic. But who might be at greatest risk? Individuals at increased risk of the disease and/or adverse outcomes might be expected to experience greater mental health difficulties. Several such groups have now been identified. For example, the death rate is known to be higher in men and older individuals. 7, 8 The latter also being more likely to have co-existing conditions and be socially-isolated through shielding. The ethnic diversity of countries such as the US and UK has also highlighted that individuals from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds appear to be affected disproportionately by the disease. 9 Finally, recent UK data suggest that some key-workers, in particular those in social care, are at greater risk of COVID-19 related mortality. 7 This combined with evidence from China of increased anxiety and depression among health care workers, 3 suggests that key-workers may also be at greater risk of adverse mental health outcomes.",

Successive systematic reviews demonstrate not only poorer mental health outcomes, but also increased morbidity and mortality in individuals who perceive themselves to be more lonely and lacking in support. 14, 15 A determinant also attracting attention is positive mood. It is now recognised that positive mood is not just the opposite of negative mood, but may in fact confer direct effects on well-being as well as protective effects in challenging situations. 10, 16 In terms of mental health outcomes, evidence suggests that the existence of positive mood reduces the risk of mood disorders by 28% and anxiety disorders by 53%, and also influences recovery from some mental health conditions. 17, 18 Taken together there is an urgent need to report evidence on the prevalence of mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, to understand who may be at greatest risk, and to explore the psychological and social resources that may mitigate this risk. To that end, we report cross sectional findings from a community cohort survey conducted between 3 rd and 30 th April 2020 which coincided with the first 4-6 weeks of social distancing measures being introduced in the UK.",

Multivariable linear regression analyses were then used to explore the independent relationships of non-modifiable factors (age, gender, ethnicity, keyworker status, living alone) on outcome variables. Then, in subsequent models, modifiable explanatory factors (perceived loneliness, perceived risk of COVID-19, positive mood, worry about contracting COVID-19) were added to examine the additional and independent contribution of these factors to explaining variation in the outcome variables. The variable assessing COVID-19 worry was treated as a categorical variable in all models, with \"occasional worry\" treated as the reference value as this was the most common response. Assumptions of linear regression (normality and homoscedasticity of residuals, linearity with continuous variables) and presence of outliers were assessed graphically. Square root transformations were used for depression and anxiety scores to satisfy assumptions. Robustness of the models were examined by removing data points with large residuals (<-3 or >3) and comparing results to the original models. In the vast majority of models, this had no substantive effect on interpretation. Thus these results are only mentioned where interpretation may be affected. Additionally, as perceived risk of getting COVID-19 was not assessed in those who thought they had had it (n=519) these participants are not represented in final multivariable models. As a sensitivity analysis, models were additionally re-specified excluding this explanatory variable (see supplementary appendix).",

Overall mean values are significantly higher than previously reported population norms [23] [24] [25] . For both anxiety and depression the means for the cohort were higher for both genders compared with their respective population norms, and also for all age ranges between 25-64 years. In contrast, both men and women aged over 65 years had anxiety and depression scores consistent with previous population norms. The data suggested no significant differences in stress scores by gender, despite the combined mean score exceeding the population norm. Table 3 shows the categorisation of participants in line with established cut-offs for anxiety and depression. This shows 64% of participants reported symptoms of depression and 57% reported symptoms of anxiety.

The findings indicated that mean levels of depression, anxiety and stress significantly exceeded recent population norms.

Increased depression was associated with being younger, female and living alone; increased anxiety was associated with being younger and female; and increased stress was associated with being younger, female, living alone, being from a BAME background and not being a keyworker. In contrast, when we added the hypothesised modifiable variables into our multivariable models we observed that they accounted for a much larger proportion of the variance (54-57%) with significant independent effects emerging for positive mood, perceived loneliness and worry about getting COVID-19 for all three outcomes, as well as perceived risk of COVID-19 emerging as significant for anxiety and stress.",

First, both mean scores and measures of caseness indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is having widespread and deleterious effects on the emotional wellbeing of people in the UK. This is true for depression, generalised anxiety disorder and stress and is in keeping with observations from other countries. 2,3 Indeed, the proportion of participants who would require intensive support for depression and anxiety in the NHS does not compare favourably with recent historical estimates of the prevalence of mental health problems in the UK. For example, the 2014 ONS report on adult psychiatric morbidity reported a prevalence of 17% for six different common mental disorders. 27 The prevalence of depression alone in the context of this pandemic is almost double this.",

These findings are consistent with unpublished data from another UK community cohort recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic with a similar gender profile to our own, 28 suggesting that these groups may be the most in need of intervention. Although this runs counter to our hypothesis that the greatest psychological morbidity would be observed in individuals at greatest risk of COVID-19, it is consistent with previous work which has shown that individual's perceptions of disease risk are often poorly related to actual risk. 29 Alternatively, the results may reflect the fact that the pandemic has resulted in a panoply of challenges to mental health that go beyond the disease itself. It could be hypothesised, for example, that some of the more immediate consequences such as unemployment, financial concerns and increased domestic violence would disproportionately affect younger people and women and this may explain our findings.",

These findings are encouraging as they suggest that there is considerable potential for us to develop interventions to mitigate the mental health effects of the pandemic. The measures of perceived loneliness, positive mood and worry about getting COVID-19 were strongly associated with all three outcomes and thus would be appropriate cognitions to be targeted in future interventions. 30 A further issue concerns the effects of the pandemic beyond mental health. It is well known that when negative mood states persist over time they result in the dysregulation of physiological systems involved in the regulation of the immune system. 31 Thus, there exists significant potential for the psychological harm inflicted by the pandemic to translate into physical harm. This could include an increased susceptibility to the virus, worse outcomes if infected, or indeed poorer responses to vaccinations in the future. 32 Studies providing longitudinal data on the prevalence of psychological morbidity and appropriate biomarkers (e.g., cortisol) will be required to determine whether the risks to physical health go beyond the hypothetical.",
