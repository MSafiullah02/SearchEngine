We confirm the vanishing of the threshold regardless of the correlation pattern and the degree exponent \u03b3 . Thresholds determined numerically are compared with quenched mean-field (QMF) and pair quenched mean-field (PQMF) theories. Correlations do not change the overall picture: The QMF and PQMF theories provide estimates that are asymptotically correct for large sizes for \u03b3 < 5/2, while they only capture the vanishing of the threshold for \u03b3 > 5/2, failing to reproduce quantitatively how this occurs. For a given size, PQMF theory is more accurate. We relate the variations in the accuracy of QMF and PQMF predictions with changes in the spectral properties (spectral gap and localization) of standard and modified adjacency matrices, which rule the epidemic prevalence near the transition point, depending on the theoretical framework. We also show that, for \u03b3 < 5/2, while QMF theory provides an estimate of the epidemic threshold that is asymptotically exact, it fails to reproduce the singularity of the prevalence around the transition.",

A large number of networks representing real systems show a heavy-tailed degree distribution described by a power law P(k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 [4, 5] , usually with strong levels of correlations [6, 7] . Degree correlations are encoded in the conditional probability P(k |k) that a vertex of degree k is connected to a vertex of degree k [6] . Technological networks, such as the Internet, show in general disassortative mixing [6, 7] , i.e., vertices of large degree tend to be connected with those of small degree and vice versa. Assortative mixing occurs in social networks, where connections preferentially occur among vertices exhibiting similar degree. Since uncorrelated networks usually simplify theoretical approaches, they are typical benchmarks for the investigation of dynamical processes on networks and have been considered in many studies [8] [9] [10] . However, the ubiquitousness of correlations in real networks naturally calls for the investigation of the effect of correlated interaction patterns. While the effects of degree correlations have been considered for several dynamical processes [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] , a full understanding of their effects on the performance of theoretical approaches is still missing.",

For random uncorrelated networks, such as those created according to the uncorrelated configuration model [29] , when \u03b3 < 5/2 the two theories tend to agree, predicting a vanishing threshold as the network size diverges [22] . For \u03b3 > 3 instead, QMF theory correctly predicts again the asymptotic vanishing of the epidemic threshold [30] , while the HMF theory fails, predicting the existence of a finite threshold. In spite of being qualitatively correct, QMF theory is however not able to accurately predict the effective finite-size epidemic threshold in this case [25] . A further quantitative improvement of the QMF theory has been achieved in Ref. [26] [hereafter called of pair QMF (PQMF) theory] by means of the explicit inclusion of pairwise dynamical correlations [31] [32] [33] .

We find that correlations do not change qualitatively the scenario found on uncorrelated networks. The epidemic threshold vanishes asymptotically with the system size for both assortative and disassortative correlations. For \u03b3 < 5/2, both QMF and PQMF theories seem to provide an asymptotically exact estimate of the numerical threshold, while they are only qualitatively correct for \u03b3 > 5/2. As in the case of uncorrelated networks [26] , PQMF theory outperforms the other theories. The amplitude of the discrepancies between numerics and theory is correlated with violations of the assumptions underlying them, revealing that both theories tend to be more accurate if the principal eigenvector of the (effective) adjacency matrix is not strongly localized or the spectral gap is large. The same scenario is found to hold when SIS dynamics is considered on a set of real-world topologies. In addition, we analyze the singularity of the prevalence near the transition point through the critical exponent \u03b2, defined as \u03c1 \u223c (\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb c ) \u03b2 . Interestingly, we find that for \u03b3 < 5/2, even if the QMF theory provides an asymptotically exact estimate of the position of the epidemic threshold, the QMF prediction for the prevalence exponent, \u03b2 (QMF) = 1 [23, 36] , is correct only not too close to the transition.",

Figure 1 shows \u03ba nn as a function of k for networks obtained with the WPCM algorithm [35] using different values of \u03b3 and \u03b1, with lowest degree k min = 3. We adopt different upper cutoffs for the degree distribution. For \u03b3 < 3, the structural cutoff k max = 2 \u221a N [37] is used, while for \u03b3 > 3, a rigid cutoff is determined by the condition NP(k max ) = 1 [38] . The first choice allows us to enhance the effects of hubs and to approach faster the thermodynamic limit while fulfilling the criterion k max < \u221a k N necessary to produce uncorrelated networks in the case \u03b1 = 0 [37] . The second choice is justified by numerical reasons explained in Sec. II B. The predetermined scaling law \u03ba nn (k) \u223c k \u03b1 is very well reproduced. Small deviations for positive or negative \u03b1 are due to the network finite size that prevents \u03ba nn from decaying or increasing indefinitely with k. The range of the power-law behavior is extended as the network size increases. 033024-2",

For random uncorrelated power-law networks the PEV is always localized [43] .

In such a case Y 4 \u223c N (\u03b3 \u22123)/2 . For \u03b3 > 5/2 it is instead strongly localized on the largest hub plus its nearest neighbors and Y 4 \u223c O(1) [45] . Hence, within QMF theory the threshold separates the absorbing phase from an active but strictly nonendemic state. However this does not imply that QMF predictions are necessarily flawed. Equation (9) factorizes the state of nearest neighbors and thus neglects dynamical correlations 033024-3 among them. These dynamical correlations actually transmit the infection from the localized PEV to the rest of the network and thus may in principle transform the active but localized state just above \u03bb QMF c into a full-fledged endemic state [25, 46] .",

Thus, the IPR of {w (1) i }, denoted by Y 4 [B i j ], allows us to quantify the localization in the PQMF theory. \u221a N for \u03b3 < 3 and k max \u223c N 1/\u03b3 for \u03b3 > 3. Curves are averages over ten networks; error bars are smaller than symbols. Figure 2 shows the dependence of the epidemic threshold as a function of the network size obtained in simulations with different values of \u03b3 and \u03b1. We concentrate for the moment on two values of \u03b3 , representative of the cases \u03b3 < 5/2 and \u03b3 > 3, for which the physical mechanisms underlying the epidemic transition are clear [47] . Later we will discuss the case 5/2 < \u03b3 < 3, whose interpretation is hampered by extremely long crossover phenomena in the spectral properties. As we can see from this figure, all thresholds vanish as N diverges, regardless of the correlation level \u03b1 and heterogeneity \u03b3 . Compared to the uncorrelated case, assortative networks (\u03b1 > 0) have a smaller threshold, while the threshold is larger for \u03b1 < 0, i.e., disassortative mixing, in agreement with the behavior of the LEV of the adjacency matrix [14, 23] . In the case \u03b3 > 3, this phenomenology can be qualitatively explained by considering the mechanism of long-range mutual reinfection of hubs [25, 46, 48] , which triggers the epidemic transition. According to this mechanism, the subgraph consisting of the hub plus its nearest neighbors can sustain in isolation an active state for times long enough to permit the activation of other hubs, even if they are not directly connected. This mechanism is at work independently of degree correlations, as long as distances among hubs increase slowly enough with network size. In assortative networks, communication among hubs is enhanced since they have higher probability to be closer; for disassortative topology the converse is true and larger values of \u03bb are needed to trigger the transition.",

Correlations leave the scaling exponent unchanged, altering only the prefactor: The smaller the \u03b1, the smaller the IPR. This means that the PEV is still localized on a subextensive fraction of nodes. However, since Y 4 increases with \u03b1, the PEV is more localized for positive \u03b1 than for negative. The same is true for the matrix B i j of the PQMF theory. Interestingly, the effect on the performance of the theoretical approaches is opposite. The QMF theory works better for larger Y 4 and the PQMF theory works better for smaller Y 4 . We have no simple interpretation for this result. Figure 4 (c) shows the spectral gap for the WPCM networks with \u03b3 = 2.3. In this case the gap increases with network size and it is smaller for smaller \u03b1. This is true also for the spectral gap of the PQMF theory. Finally, let us observe that there is almost no difference between the spectral properties of A i j and B i j for \u03b3 = 2.3.

The localization phenomenon of the PEV in the case 5/2 < \u03b3 < 3 is asymptotically analogous to the case \u03b3 > 3. However, very strong crossover effects are observed in this case, because of the presence of a localization process on the maximum K-core (as for \u03b3 < 5/2) competing with the localization around the hub [43] . As a consequence, already in the uncorrelated case, the PEV gets strongly localized around the largest hub only for very large values of N. Correlations further complicate the picture: Figure 6 (b) shows that disassortative correlations accelerate the convergence to the final localized state. For \u03b1 > 0 instead, Y 4 is a decreasing function of N. The upward bend of the curve hints at an incipient crossover, but one cannot exclude that the asymptotic behavior is different for \u03b1 > 0.

A large spectral gap or a low IPR leads to a good performance of the mean-field theories, while the converse, small gap or large IPR, leads to deviations from the theoretical predictions. The QMF theory seems to be more correlated with the spectral gap, while the PQMF theory is with the IPR, at least in the regime where the gap is significant and the theories are accurate. ",

The analyses for QMF theory are shown in the scatter plots of the relative error \u03b5 against the corresponding topological properties in Figs. 7(d) and 7(e). Qualitatively similar patterns obtained for PQMF theory are not shown. We can see that in real networks, the correlation between the performance of the theoretical prediction and the spectral gap is on average the same as that observed for the WPCM: A larger spectral gap is associated with a higher accuracy. The inverse correlation with the IPR is again preserved: A smaller Y 4 corresponds to a more accurate prediction. We do not find a significant correlation with the Pearson coefficient. Statistical analyses were performed using the correlation coefficients obtained from either power law, in the case of the spectral gap and IPR, or from exponential, in the case of the Pearson coefficient, regressions of the scatter plots. We obtain strong statistical correlations with |r| 0.70 (p < 10 \u22125 ) for both QMF and PQMF theories using either the IPR or spectral gap of the corresponding matrices. Values r 0.2 (p > 0.05) for correlation with the Pearson coefficient of the network confirm no significant statistical correlations. Figure 2 shows that the QMF prediction for the epidemic threshold tends to the same limit of numerical simulations for both uncorrelated and correlated networks for \u03b3 = 2.3. This observation naturally leads to one wonder whether the QMF theory is asymptotically an exact description for SIS dynamics 033024-7 on random networks with \u03b3 < 5/2. In order to answer this question we test the exactness of the other prediction of the QMF theory, Eq. (12), stating that the fraction of infected individuals decays to zero linearly as the threshold is approached from above. Numerical results, for the case of uncorrelated networks \u03b1 = 0 are shown in Fig. 8 , where the density and the infection rates are rescaled to conform to Eq. (12) . We can clearly see the existence of two scaling regimes. For \u03bb 1 \u2212 1 1 the density scales with an exponent larger than the prediction \u03b2 (QMF) = 1. The observed exponent is consistent with the exact result of Ref. [51] , \u03b2 = 1/(3 \u2212 \u03b3 ), which is also (probably accidentally) the value predicted by HMF theory [52] . This exponent is observed in a regime very close to the transition, where the system is kept asymptotically active only by virtue of the quasistationary method. We performed a nonperturbative analysis by integrating the QMF equations using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method for \u03bb > 1 (1) for N = 10 7 . A comparison with simulation results confirms that the QMF theory correctly predicts the linear behavior of the prevalence \u03c1 around the epidemic transition, but only sufficiently far from it. In the immediate neighborhood of the threshold the decay is more rapid.",

Several theoretical approaches have been proposed, applying approximations with different levels of stringency, that provide contrasting predictions on the epidemic threshold. Among the main theoretical approaches at the mean-field level we can consider, in decreasing order of approximation, the heterogeneous mean-field theory, neglecting dynamical correlations and the actual pattern of connections in the network (preserving only its statistical properties); the quenched mean-field theory, also neglecting dynamical correlations but keeping the network structure; and the pair quenched mean-field theory, which incorporates dynamical correlations between pairs of connected nodes. In this paper we have presented a comparison of the predictions of these three approximate theories for the case of the susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic model, focusing on the case of networks with a power-law degree distribution and degree correlations, representative of many real network systems.",

While overall PQMF theory is more accurate than QMF theory, the two approximations show different levels of accuracy when compared in networks with different levels of correlations. Thus, for the case of synthetic networks generated with the Weber-Porto algorithm [35] , we observed that, for fixed network size and degree heterogeneity, QMF predictions are more accurate in assortative networks than in disassortative ones. On the other hand, PQMF theory is increasingly accurate in the presence of disassortative correlations for small degree exponent, while it is more accurate when correlations are assortative if the degree exponent is large.",
