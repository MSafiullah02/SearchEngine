The NCP is caused by a new coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) of the Sarbe virus subgenus, a member of orthocoronavirus subfamily. 1 SARS-COV-2 is a member of the coronavirus family along with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. With the deepening of research, more and more evidence show that its transmission channels are diversified, and its transmission speed and infectivity are stronger than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. [2] [3] [4] Since the outbreak of the epidemic, China has taken active prevention and control measures and achieved good results, but, recently, the epidemic situation abroad has begun to develop into an uncontrollable situation. As of 28 February 2020, the epidemic of NCP has affected six continents, and the epidemic situation in South Korea, Italy, Japan, and other countries is extremely serious. On 29 February, the \"China-WHO NCP (COVID-19) Joint Inspection Report\" stated that the NCP is almost susceptible to everyone on the same day. On 11 March, the WHO declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as pandemic.",

Generally, viral pneumonia mainly involves pulmonary interstitium, producing pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. The autopsy report of the first NCP patient in China found that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mainly caused the inflammatory response characterized by deep airway and alveolar damage, accompanied by a large amount of viscous secretions in the airway. The pulmonary transparent membrane became less obvious, and the degree of fibrosis was not as severe as SARS. 38 However, the degree of effect of COVID-19 on pulmonary fibrosis still needs to be paid close attention, which is also an important factor influencing pulmonary function in the prognosis of patients with NCP. In this meta-analysis, white blood cells were normal or decreased in most patients, lymphocytes were mostly decreased, and CRP, LDH, ESR level was elevated in some patients. A few patients had elevated creatine kinase procalcitonin bilirubin, whereas some had decreased albumin and elevated ALT, AST. The pathological results of patients with SARS-COV-2 suggested that the excessive activation of T lymphocytes, which is characterized by increased Th17 cells and high toxicity of CD8 + T cells, has caused severe immune damage to a certain extent. 4 This may be the main reason for the loss of lymphocytes in patients. Sequence comparison analysis showed that the S spike protein of SARS-COV-2 contains a SARS-CoV-like receptor binding domain, which indicates that ACE2 may be the main receptor of SARS-COV-2. 3 F I G U R E 3 The forest plots of the incidence of comorbidities and intensive care unit (ICU).

Overexpressed ACE2 may be related to the elevated liver enzyme.39 The similarity of SARS-COV-2 and SARS-CoV gene sequences suggests that the mechanism of action may also be similar. SARS-COV-2 enters host cells through dense S protein, 40,41 acts on bronchial epithelial cells through ACE2 receptor, and then infects other cells, causing a series of immune responses or inflammatory cytokine storm in severe cases. In addition, the sequence alignment showed that the SARS-COV-2 and SARS-CoV S2 subunits are highly conserved, and the overall identity in the HR1 and HR2 domains is 92.6% and 100%, respectively. This suggested that novel coronary pneumonia drugs research may base on this site.42 In imaging results, this meta-analysis showed that 75.7% of the patients had lesions involving both lungs, and 69.9% showed groundglass shadows on imaging, mostly interstitial pulmonary lesions.Chest CT showed consolidation shadow nodular or patchy shadow in some patients, whereas there also existed other characteristics in few patients, such as chest-shaped shadows, thick cord-like shadows, pleural reactions, thickened blood vessels, pleural effusion, andF I G U R E 4 The forest plots of the incidence of clinical features.
