Hence, inappropriate pre surgical screening for COVID-19 can be an impediment to safe HNC surgery [4].

While the viral tests making use of RT-PCR or qRT-PCR and ELISA tests detecting antibodies usually require laboratories or specific conditions [9], rapid antibody tests can be done albeit any particular conditions. Although qRT-PCR remains the gold standard, it is not without fallibility [5]. Its sensitivity varies depending on the kits and PCR instrument deployed [9] and mostly takes long to be processed. Rapid RT-PCR tests that have been launched are processed faster but require special armamentarium and only a few can be done at a time depending upon machine capabilities and supply of reagents. RT-PCR test in principle has 100% sensitivity. Nevertheless, due to biology of the disease, for instance, inappropriate timing of sample collection in relation to disease onset or the virus not being present in the particular location being tested at the particular time results in some false negatives [3], [9]. Other RT-PCR false negatives may be attributable to further problems, such as laboratories being under the cosh, substandard sample collection and preparation [9]. Healthcare practitioners must be aware of these problems as a single test report cannot be taken at face value.",
