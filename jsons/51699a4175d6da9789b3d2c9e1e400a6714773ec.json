For fetal cardiology visits, a maximum of one support person who undergoes the same screening process as the patients may accompany visits can be consolidated to include routine obstetrical care. Home fetal heart rate monitoring with telemedicine consultation instead of intermittent fetal echocardiography can also be considered in cases of fetal arrhythmia to minimize follow-up clinic visits.",

Children may frequently be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, which may unknowingly expose the provider to infection. Children are often unable to cooperate and follow instructions; cardiac anatomy may be highly variable and require longer scan times to assess; and sedation may be necessary for even routine transthoracic studies. Thus protection procedures require modification to those recommended for general adult echocardiography as presented in the main statement. 1 These PCHD modifications are presented below. Additional information regarding the role of learners, options for echocardiography education in the absence of direct scanning, and important general considerations for reducing transmission outside of the scan room are presented in the main statement. 1 Personnel As for the adult patient, imaging should be performed according to local standards for the prevention of virus spread, including use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Meticulous ASEcho.org and frequent hand washing is crucial and applies to the sonographer, patient when possible, and to a single caregiver who is likely to contact patient and sonographer while helping to facilitate the cooperation of an active child. A surgical face mask should be worn by symptomatic patients, provided appropriate pediatric and adult-sized masks are available and institutional resources allow this strategy for source control. 11 In addition to the aerosolized transmission of SARS-CoV-2, potential for fecal transmission has been reported. 5, 12 Diaper care should therefore be avoided if possible during the exam, and if necessary performed with appropriate virucidal hygiene.",

For those deferred to a later date, creation of a virtual \"waiting list\" should be considered for scheduling to assure that all patients at risk are evaluated prior to delivery.

Options to decrease fomite transmission may include covering probes and machine consoles with disposable plastic and foregoing the use of ECG stickers, or setting aside certain machines or probes for use on patients with suspected or confirmed infection.

Outside of these scenarios, TEE should be considered a high-risk procedure and the benefits of a TEE examination weighed against the risk of exposure of healthcare personnel in a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and the availability of PPE. TEEs should be postponed or canceled if an alternative imaging modality (e.g. off axis TTE views, agitated saline contrast or other ultrasound enhancing agent with TTE) can provide the necessary information. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also be considered as alternatives to TEE. The benefits of avoiding an aerosolizing procedure should be balanced against the risk of transport, need to disinfect a different scan room, as well as the baseline risks in children of iodinated contrast and radiation with CT, and longer scan times for MRI.Given the unreliability of symptoms to predict COVID-19 status in children, use of a standardized algorithm for TEE procedures is recommended. An example is presented below ASEcho.org and inFigure 2. Modification and implementation of any TEE algorithm should be coordinated with all members of the perioperative team at each institution to best match resources and equipment. Ideally, as SARS-CoV-2 testing becomes more available at the hospital level with more rapid resulting, all patients for whom TEE is planned (i.e. most surgical patients, and some interventional cardiac catheterization patients) should have SARS-CoV-2 testing performed during pre-op screening.1. All pediatric patients for TEE are presumed positive unless they have had a negative COVID-19 test within 48 to 72 hours. If documented negative COVID-19 testing, then TEE may proceed using standard precautions (gloves, mask, and eye protection). 2. For pediatric patients without COVID-19 negative testing within 72 hours who are intubated prior to arrival to the Cardiovascular Operating Room (CVOR)/interventional suite, the risk for aerosolization is considered low. Probe placement may be performed by anesthesia to minimize personnel performing oropharyngeal manipulation or by cardiology according to institutional standard procedures and following standard precautions. 3. For asymptomatic patients without COVID-19 negative testing within 72 hours who require intubation in the CVOR/interventional suite, anesthesia should intubate donning appropriate PPE/Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPR). This should be followed by a wait period (typically 20-30-minutes depending on local protocols and environmental factors) to permit complete air turnover in the room, during which no one should enter. Strong consideration should be given to TEE probe placement by ASEcho.org anesthesia immediately following airway stabilization while still under aerosol precautions and prior to the air turnover period to minimize the risk of exposure of additional personnel. After the wait period, probe manipulation may be performed by cardiology according to institutional standard procedures and following standard precautions. 4. For COVID-19 positive or symptomatic children without COVID-19 negative testing within 72 hours, strict isolation is mandated. Strong consideration should be given to probe placement by anesthesia to minimize risk of exposure associated with oropharyngeal manipulation and according to institutional standard procedures. a. All personnel in the CVOR, interventional suite, or procedure room must wear strict isolation gear at all times. b. All personnel must have training in donning and doffing PPE/PAPR c.

Decisions on whether or not an echocardiogram should be performed in a PCHD patient may be guided by the appropriate use criteria established by the ASE and other societies, 7,8 with risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection highlighting the need to avoid rarely appropriate exams. In addition, multiple societies (AIUM, ISUOG and AHA) have established guidelines for indications for fetal echocardiography referral. A full discussion of how to determine both who should be imaged as well as when imaging should be considered is presented in the main statement, 1 acknowledging that adjustments to these decisions should be made by each individual institution. ASEcho.org Fetal echocardiographic evaluation presents different challenges; there is a finite gestational period within which pregnancy decision-making and perinatal/neonatal management plans are made. The AHA divides fetal echocardiography referrals into risk levels based on indication. 9 Triage and scheduling of these patients in general can be determined based on an assessment of level of risk relating to the indication for referral as well as the fetal diagnosis. TEE carries a heightened risk of spread of SARS-CoV-2 since it can provoke aerosolization of a large amount of virus. Whether the intubated PCHD patient having a TEE exposes the care team to a greater risk with this modality compared to TTE remains unclear. Considerations for both fetal echocardiography and PCHD TEE are discussed in greater detail in the Advanced Imaging section below.",
