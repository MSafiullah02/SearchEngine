With a growing population, urbanization, and increased income, the food industry has become increasingly market driven. As a result of globalization and reduced trade barriers, it has grown to account for approximately 10% of the world\u2019s gross domestic product (Murray 2007). Fortunately, environmental protection and sustainability are currently better aligned with the worlds\u2019 consumption of natural resources. Over the past few decades, it has tried to adopt technologies to improve waste minimization and environmental performance. Although the most valuable elements are extracted from foods during harvest and processing, what remains in both the product-specific and product-nonspecific wastes may also contain other potentially valuable components.",

For most common edible crops, the residue-to-crop-production ratio is between 0.9 and 3 to 1 (Scarlat et al., 2010). This mass is not accounted for in Table 1.2, however, typical quantities of some common food crops are given in Table 1.3\n. In lower-income regions, losses occur at every stage, particularly postharvest, to a much higher degree, but occur significantly less at the consumption stage. Higher losses throughout production in low-income regions are an artefact of inadequate knowledge, skills, technologies, and infrastructure to support the food supply chain compared to the industrialized world (Godfray et al., 2010b).",

Cottonseed meal is also high in protein and is mainly used as cattle feed in the United States or as aquaculture feed.

Such disputes imply the presence of a transatlantic divide over what constitutes a legitimate risk regulation, however, this is an oversimplification. Although the risk regulations set forth by the European Union take a precautionary approach, acting in light of scientific uncertainty and taking into account public concerns, the US system is based on a \u201csound science\u201d approach, free from political influence, however, this has not always been the case. It has been argued that the United States used to be more precautionary than the European Union (Hornsby, 2013), but was pressured to limit the calculation of risk in public policy. The EU\u2019s regulatory failures during food safety crises served to undermine public trust in the EU institutions, resulting in the use of a precautionary approach (Hornsby, 2013). Overall, it has also been proposed that both regions partake in \u201coccasional and selective application of precaution to different risks in different places and time\u201d (Wiener, 2011).

More recent infectious disease outbreaks, such as avian influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome, have further jeopardized diplomatic relations, frightened the public, and caused massive economic losses by disrupting global commerce (Karesh and Cook, 2005). Since then, concern over the risks posed by ABPs, including infectious diseases (such as swine fever, foot and mouth) and other contaminants (such as dioxins), to human and animal health, has resulted in strict regulations regarding their safe handling and disposal (Cunningham, 2003, Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, 2011). As such, most countries now have local regulations put in place that are typically broad in scope and directly affect any person or business that generates, uses, disposes, stores, handles, or transports food waste containing animal products and ABPs derived from the food processing industry.",

However, most food wastes are not appropriate for incineration, owing to their high moisture content. When properly equipped, an incinerator can be used as a means of energy recovery to generate electricity. Heat released from the combustion of waste can be used to produce steam, which can turn a steam turbine, generating electricity. However, because of the increased concentration of toxins in the ash, incinerators must be operated alongside landfill systems in order to dispose of them. Combustion destroys chemical compounds and disease-causing bacteria, leaving it pathogen free, but causes serious environmental problems through the production of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and trace quantities of toxic pollutants, such as heavy metals and dioxins. The remaining residues are often landfilled, owing to their high heavy metal content.",

This involves a combination of chemical and microbiological processes occurring throughout three stages that convert organic materials to a stable, soil-like product called compost (Som et al., 2009, Verbeek et al., 2012). Provided composting is carried out well, the volume and mass of the waste can be reduced by up to 40%. For composting to occur efficiently, the conditions of the composting process must be maintained at an optimal level to encourage microbial growth. Because of changes in the composition of waste material with location and over time, the compost mixture needs optimization through regular adjustments. For example, if the system becomes anaerobic, offensive odors can be produced, and if it becomes too wet or too dry, the process will halt altogether. Some of these organic waste materials require specific pretreatment before composting can occur. In the United Kingdom, EU standards must be implemented over and above UK standards if the site treats category 2 ABPs, which have first been pressure rendered, or category 3 ABPs if they exclude catering waste. Exceptions apply for some types of ABPs in the United Kingdom, which can be composted in closed reactors at 70\u00b0C for more than 1 h or in housed rows of piled green-waste (windrows) at 60\u00b0C for more than 8 days under strict operating parameters with a maximum particle size of 400 mm.",
