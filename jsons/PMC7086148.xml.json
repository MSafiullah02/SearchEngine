Further, studies on children with respiratory tract infection (RTI) have investigated the association of RV viral load and presence of RV-viremia as markers of disease severity [13,14].

Briefly, pneumonia cases were children aged 1\u201359 months hospitalized with World Health Organization (WHO)-defined pneumonia (according to the pre-2013 definitions) [17,18]. Prior to enrolment, cases received a bronchodilator challenge in order to exclude cases with hyper-reactive airway. Controls were enrolled from the same community as cases and were matched 1:1 to cases on age-group frequency and HIV-status. The community controls were invited to present at the day-clinic for sample collection and clinical evaluation. The controls could have signs and symptoms of respiratory illness as long as they did not fulfil the criteria for severe pneumonia.",

Additionally, the detection rates of RV-C viremia were higher than both RV-A and RV-B; in fact, no RV-B viremia cases were detected which is in line with other studies which have also failed to detect viremia due to RV-B [13,14,22,26]. This could be related to the much lower prevalence of RV-B in the population (9% among cases and 8% among controls), but strongly supports evidence to the hypothesis that RV-B might have lower pathogenicity than RV-A and RV-C [[27], [28], [29]].",

In fact those with RV-viremia had shorter hospital stays compared to the non-viremia cases. All of the children in this study were hospitalized with severe or very-severe pneumonia whereas the Italian study was conducted in children with both upper and lower respiratory tract which could account for the differences seen in the association of RV-viremia with more severe disease outcomes. Further; the RV-viremia detection rate in our study (7%) was lower than reported in previous studies (11 %\u201312 %) [13,14,22], although all of the cited studies were conducted in children less than 14 years of age hospitalized with upper or lower RTI; whereas, we only enrolled children 1\u201359 months of age hospitalized with pneumonia. In a study from Greece [14], 11 % of hospitalized RV nasopharyngeal positive children had RV-viremia, the majority (70 %) of the RV-viremia positive cases presented with asthma exacerbations, whilst no RV-viremia cases were detected among children hospitalized with RV-associated pneumonia. Similarly, in the Philippines study [22], the majority (73 %) of the RV-viremia positive cases were in children presenting with wheezing disease.

Of the four controls positive for RV-viremia, one had an upper RTI and the remaining three were asymptomatic at the time of sampling. However, RV-viremia has been described to be mainly detected during the early stages of disease symptomatology [14], and the viral load of RV was substantially higher among our controls with RV-viremia. Thus the three RV-viremia positive controls could have been in the incubation period of illness at the time of sampling. One of the limitations of our study was that controls were not systematically followed up post sampling, hence we were unable to confirm that these children did not subsequently develop pneumonia that required hospitalization. A Finnish case-control study which enrolled asymptomatic controls in addition to cases with acute expiratory wheezing, observed that 38 % of the RV positive controls developed respiratory symptoms within the week following sampling [30]. Nevertheless, the detection of RV-viremia among community controls, even at the very low prevalence seen in our study was unexpected, and further highlights the challenges of defining the etiological role of RV in the pathogenesis of pneumonia.",

Additionally, the small sample size of RV-viremia positive cases and controls could have limited our power to discern clinical severity differences. Future studies will need to look at characterizing the RV molecular epidemiology and presence of viremia at the remaining 6 PERCH sites in Africa and Southeast Asia. Further, the RV typing method used in this study targeted the non-coding region (NCR) which has been shown to have a higher sensitivity for typing in clinical samples [21,22]; however, the NCR is less conserved thus sequencing of the conserved capsid region to confirm the RV-C typing would be beneficial in order to study the importance of RV species in severe disease in greater detail.",
