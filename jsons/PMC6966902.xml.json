The contaminated environment is a well-established source for transmission of these organisms [2]. Inadequate room cleaning at wards may increase the risk of acquisition of pathogens for the subsequent occupant. During a 14-month study performed at two intensive care units (ICUs), patients admitted to rooms where the prior patients carried vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) had documented increased risks of VRE acquisition (hazard ratio, 4.4) [3]. A case-control study showed that cases who had been exposed to a prior infected or colonized bed occupant had a 5.83-fold increased risk in developing a HAI with the same organism [4]. Thus, it is important to implement effective terminal cleaning and disinfection at wards to prevent transmission of MDRO.",

Allowing 10 min after terminal cleaning and disinfection for the surfaces to dry to avoid that residuals of the disinfectant, each high-touch surface was examined under ultraviolet light. Each high-touch surface with the same 100 cm2 area adjacent fluorescent marker was entirely swabbed using a close zigzag pattern by simultaneously a swab of ATP assay and a pre-moistened sterile culture swab. The ATP swab was activated in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and the reading (in relative light units, RLU) was recorded. For ACC method, each culture swab was suspended in 1 mL sterile saline then vortexed for 10 s, and 0.2 mL was spread on to a tryptic soy agar with neutralizers (Creative Microbiologicals, Taipei County, Taiwan). After 48 h of incubation at 35 \u00b0C, the total numbers of colonies on the agar were calculated. For fluorescent marker, a surface with less than one quarter circle of residual gel was considered clean according to our previous approach [10]. The benchmark clean criteria of ATP assay were < 250 RLU in ICUs and < 500 RLU in general wards [11]. The benchmark clean criterion of ACC method was < 100 colony forming units (CFU)/100 cm2 [12]. Effective terminal cleaning and disinfection was qualified with the aggregate outcome of the same 10 high-touch surfaces in each room by the fluorescent marker, the ATP assay, and the ACC method respectively. A score for each high-touch surface was recorded, with 0 denoting a fail and 10 denoting a pass by the benchmark of the evaluation method.

The bleach was diluted with cold water using the uniform containers by the ESWs for standardization (Additional file 1). The reminder was a form that had 14 high-touch surfaces photographs at a patient unit and had to be checked by the ESW at the first terminal cleaning and disinfection opportunity at every work day (Additional file 2). The thoroughness of terminal cleaning and disinfection practices during this phase were evaluated by three methods that were same with the sampling method during phase 1.

There is a high turnover rate among the outsourced ESWs, they need to be trained to understand how to do cleaning practice well and realize why their work is important, and to be recognized and certified to improve compliance and motivation [8]. Thus, the environmental cleaning and disinfection strategies are not only improving the cleaning knowledge and skills of the ESWs, but also reducing and simplifying the workflow barriers that can balance timeliness of completing tasks and optimize the cleaning practice [14]. After phase 3 of this study, we used a survey to assess knowledge and practices of environmental cleaning among the ESWs, there were 97% ESWs (65/67) agreed that the checklist-form reminder was helpful to perform terminal cleaning and disinfection well.",

Nonetheless, our data showed that the aggregate outcome of the terminal cleaning by the three different evaluation methods were all improved significantly after implementing cleaning and disinfection strategies.

We had recorded that the average number of terminal cleaning and disinfection daily by one ESW were 5.7 to 6.3 beds in the surgical wards group, 3.4 to 3.9 beds in the medical wards group, and 2.4 to 3.0 beds in the ICUs group.

Terminal cleaning and disinfection is performed at patient discharge to ensure that the patient zone is disinfected and safe for the next occupant. Our data showed that the effectiveness of terminal cleaning and disinfection was significant improved, and a significant 12.2% reduction in the MDRO carriage incidence. But the incidence of HAI with the MDRO were not change. The reason was possibly because of under-powering due to the low incidence of HAI overall, or the intervention that focus on terminal cleaning and disinfection may be insufficient to reduce the incidence of HAI with the MDRO [20, 21]. We showed that there was a significant (27.8%) reduction of VRE carriage rate, that was similar to other studies [22\u201324]. Datta et al. [22] reported the acquisition of both MRSA and VRE decreased significantly during the intervention periods that consisted of feedback using the fluorescent marker and bucket wetting the cleaning cloths with disinfectant; Hayden et al. [23] reported a significant 49.7% reduction of VRE acquisition rate during a period of educational intervention; Grabsch et al. [24] reported significant 24.8% reductions in newly recognized VRE acquisition and significant 66.4% reduction in environmental contamination after implementation of a cleaning-disinfection program. The impressive reductions in VRE carriage rates may be due to the unusual long-lived persistence of VRE in the hospital and human environment. VRE contamination is particularly a problem when single rooms are limited and cohorting of patients with VRE are practiced, even though contact precautions were performed for the patients colonized or infected with MDROs.",

The sampling area of the ATP assay cannot overlap the fluorescent marker to avoid overestimation of ATP values by residual fluorescence. A small surface was not clean by the fluorescent marker criterion, which did not mean that the adjacent 100-cm2 area had not been wiped [10]. So the data showed the TCD score of the fluorescent marker was lower than those of the other two methods. Second, we used two clean pass criteria of the ATP assay (stricter criteria in ICUs group) [11]. That was the reason the TCD score of the ATP assay in ICUs group was lower than the TCD score in general wards group after the interventions. Nonetheless, these evaluation methods of cleaning could dynamically reflect changes in the three phases. Third, we evaluated the outcome during implementing the interventions for 7 months. We were unable to verify the impact of our study on the HAI with the MDRO. The improvements of terminal cleaning and disinfection could be impacted by the Hawthorne effect of immediate feedback using the fluorescent marker. Although we did not measure other potential confounders, there were no new infection control initiatives during the study period. The hand hygiene compliance rate were 82.9% (213/257) in the pre-intervention period and 87.0% (160/184) during the intervention period at the study wards. Thus, further studies are necessary to evaluate the sustainability of such systematic improvements.",
