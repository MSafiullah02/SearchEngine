            "text": "The basic RAS persists - a single, obligate precursor protein, angiotensinogen, remains the source of all angiotensin peptides. Circulating angiotensinogen (from liver) is primarily cleaved by the protease, renin (from kidney), to yield a 10 amino acid peptide, angiotensin I (AngI), which in turn is processed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) (in lung) to produce the active octapeptide, angiotensin II (AngII). AngII binds with high affinity to 2 distinct receptors, the type 1 and type 2 angiotensin receptors (AT1R and AT2R)\u2014both are 7 transmembrane-spanning receptors that belong to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. The important cardiovascular actions of AngII, including regulation of arterial blood pressure and water-salt balance, are predominantly mediated by the AT1R in target tissues such as the blood vessels, kidney, brain and heart. The role of the AT2R is less clear (Steckelings et al., 2005)- its G protein coupling and signal transduction mechanisms remain poorly defined and its function as an antagonist of the AT1R is not universally accepted.",

            "text": "The complexity of this elementary RAS continues to evolve (Kurdi et al., 2005, Hunyady and Catt, 2006) (see Fig. 1\n). First, the generation of angiotensin within the circulation is complemented by local tissue RASs in a number of tissues, including the brain, kidney, heart, and blood vessels (Re, 2004). Angiotensin generated locally has important homeostatic functions and likely contributes to disease, yet the exact mechanism by which angiotensin is produced, in areas such as the brain, remains a source of controversy and extensive research. Second, polymorphic variations of the various RAS components (angiotensinogen, renin, ACE, AT1R and AT2R) exist and these may determine the level of angiotensin production and action (Luft, 2002, Bleumink et al., 2004, Miller and Scholey, 2004, Baudin, 2005). For example, polymorphisms in angiotensinogen (most notably M235T) may increase renin cleavage and angiotensin production and has been associated with a variety of diseases (Miller & Scholey, 2004). Similarly, genetic variations in renin (Hasimu et al., 2003) and ACE (Miller & Scholey, 2004) have been reported and associated with disease. Polymorphisms in the AT1R gene (AGTR1) may also have important functional and clinical implications and these are detailed separately in Section 4.3. Third, the recent identification and cloning of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2; Turner et al., 2004), a protein with homology (\u223c 40%) to the N-terminal catalytic domain of ACE, has revealed alternative pathways for angiotensin peptide generation. ACE2 has attracted significant interest because it efficiently cleaves the carboxyl-terminal phenylalanine from AngII to generate Ang1-7, a peptide that has hypotensive actions that counteract the actions of AngII. Ablation of ACE2 in mice indicates important roles for heart and lung function related to the RAS (Crackower et al., 2002, Imai et al., 2005, Yamamoto et al., 2006). Ang1-7 reportedly binds and acts via the GPCR, Mas (Santos et al., 2003), and evidence regarding crosstalk between AT1R and Mas is presented in Section 4.2.2.3. The generation and activity of other angiotensin peptide fragments (including Ang3-8, which appears to have its own receptor, the insulin regulated amino peptidase; Albiston et al., 2001, Albiston et al., 2003) are accepted, although the relevance to the pleiotropic actions of angiotensin remains to be fully resolved. Finally, the processing enzymes of the RAS, namely renin and ACE, may themselves be capable of signal transduction. Receptors for renin (and pro-renin) have been described, including a receptor which specifically binds the normally inactive pro-renin at the cell surface; this binding led to robust catalytic activity as well as the generation of AngII-independent intracellular signals (Nguyen, 2006). ACE is a transmembrane protein that is able to be phosphorylated within its cytoplasmic tail and can recruit signaling molecules in a manner analogous to bona fide receptors (Fleming, 2006), whereas ACE2 is also a receptor that allows internalization and infection by the SARS coronavirus (Li et al., 2003, Turner et al., 2004, Kuba et al., 2005).",

            "text": "Given the importance of angiotensin to cardiovascular homeostasis and the inherent complexity of balancing angiotensin generation and action as well as its processing into various fragments, it is not surprising that subtle, as well as overt, changes in the relative levels and activity of the precursors, processing enzymes and receptor/signaling components of the RAS might be associated with dysfunction and disease\u2014these include, hypertension, growth and remodeling of the heart, blood vessels and the kidney, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke and the complications of metabolic imbalance, such as diabetes. ACE inhibitors and AT1R blockers are widely prescribed for cardiovascular disease and show efficacy; whether this results from direct effects on AngII generation and specific blocking of AT1R signaling or indirect actions (e.g., effects on the metabolism of the vasodilator, bradykinin, during ACE inhibition or, in the case of AT1R blockade, increased AngII \u201cspillover\u201d onto the AT2R and enhanced production of AngII fragments such as Ang1-7, both of which reportedly antagonize AT1R actions) is not completely understood. The susceptibility of certain individuals and groups to develop RAS-related diseases as well as their receptiveness (or otherwise) to therapy could reasonably reflect functional polymorphisms in the genes encoding RAS components. While many studies (with mixed success) have investigated individual mutations in angiotensinogen, renin and ACE as an explanation for RAS-associated diseases, the polygenic nature of complex diseases like hypertension means more extensive, high-throughput genotyping and haplotype association studies are required. Finally, the potential that a local RAS may contribute directly to disease opens up possibilities for selective treatment. The brain RAS is an area of particular interest in this regard as local AngII generation is closely linked to increased sympathetic outflow and hypertension. A recent study in mice used virus-based vectors to deliver small interfering RNA (siRNA) to knockdown AT1R expression in discrete brain regions (Chen et al., 2006) and revealed region-selective modulation of AngII effects on blood pressure and water intake. This type of study as well as others aimed at modifying RAS and cardiovascular centres in the brain (Lu and Raizada, 1995, Sinnayah et al., 2004) portends application of virus-based approaches to long-term modulation of AngII actions in a defined manner.",

The capacity to usurp tyrosine kinase-related pathways and their downstream effectors likely explains the well-established role of AngII in the growth and remodeling of the vasculature, heart and kidney that occurs during metabolic disturbances and cardiovascular disease. Multiple mechanisms have been reported that link AT1R to these pathways including traditional Gq/11-phospholipase C pathways, the release of cytokine and growth factor ligands from cells, direct interaction between AT1R and upstream activators and scaffolds, and the transactivation of growth factor receptors, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Smith et al., 2004, Shah and Catt, 2006, Suzuki and Eguchi, 2006).

The relative contribution of the common GRK (GRK2/3/5/6) to AT1R phosphorylation has also been examined by RNA interference (RNAi), using siRNA to selectively and individually knockdown the expression of each of these isoforms (Kim et al., 2005). In HEK293 cells, GRK2 appears to be the primary kinase mediating AngII-stimulated AT1R phosphorylation, accounting for about 80% of the total GRK-mediated phosphorylation. Interestingly, in co-immunoprecipitation experiments, all the kinases (GRK2/3/5/6) contributed to the direct association between the AT1R and \u03b2-arrestin 2, suggesting that arrestin recruitment does not necessarily correlate with the amount of phosphorylation. Such an idea was supported by the reciprocal involvement of GRK2/3 versus GRK5/6 in other arrestin-dependent processes. Thus, knockdown of GRK2/3, but not GRK5/6, significantly inhibited AT1R internalization, whereas reduction GRK5/6, but not GRK2/3, impaired the arrestin-dependent, prolonged phase of AT1R-mediated ERK activation (Kim et al., 2005). These data suggest that different patterns of receptor phosphorylation can be mediated by the different GRK and subserve distinct functions. Of course, such an interpretation is based on the assumption (that remains unfounded) that GRK exclusively phosphorylate activated forms of GPCR and no other substrate that might impinge on the processes examined.",

Various stimuli, including G\u03b1q/11-phospholipase C\u03b2 signaling via GPCR, can activate PKC isoforms, and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged versions of PKC can be used to visualize activation and translocation to and from the plasma membrane (Feng et al., 1998, Violin and Newton, 2003). In contrast to GRK, PKC phosphorylates GPCR in the absence of agonist stimulation; so PKC translocated to the membrane in response to activation by one particular receptor has the capacity to phosphorylate and regulate a spectrum of other cell surface proteins and receptors, including the signaling receptor itself. In the case of the AT1R, 3 serine residues within its carboxyl-terminus (Ser331, Ser338 and Ser348) are in the consensus motif for PKC phosphorylation and all 3 are modified in response to PKC activation (Qian et al., 1999). PKC phosphorylation occurred mainly in response to low levels of AngII stimulation, whereas GRK phosphorylation of the AT1R was more predominant at higher concentrations.",

High-resolution crystal structures have been obtained for the basal \u201cinactive\u201d state of arrestin, which undergoes significant conformational rearrangement upon activation and interaction with phosphorylated receptors (Xiao et al., 2004, Charest et al., 2005, Gurevich and Gurevich, 2006, Hanson et al., 2006).

Hunyady et al. (1994a) were the first to report that AT1R mutants with severely inhizbited Gq/11 coupling retained robust AngII-induced receptor internalization, highlighting the possibility that different receptor states separately subserve receptor signaling and endocytosis. This observation has been confirmed by independent laboratories (Thomas et al., 2000, Miserey-Lenkei et al., 2001, Holloway et al., 2002, Gaborik et al., 2003) and extended to include evidence that mutant AngII ligands (like Sar1Ile4Ile8-AngII) can promote receptor phosphorylation and internalization in the absence of Gq/11 signaling. Conversely, constitutively active AT1R (receptor mutants that couple to Gq/11 in the absence of ligand binding) show very poor AngII-mediated phosphorylation, but display robust internalization (Thomas et al., 2000). Based on a number of such studies, it is now generally accepted that AT1R activation is not necessarily a linear concatenation of mutually dependent events, but rather a series of interrelated, yet definably separate, receptor conformations, which underlie the various aspects of receptor function.",

The mechanism of G protein-independent coupling remains uncertain, but may involve distinct conformational states of the AT1R, dictated by key residues within the 7th transmembrane helix (TM) (Yee et al., 2006), and/or direct interaction of these signaling components with the carboxyl-terminus of the AT1R. For example, convincing evidence exists (outlined in Section 4.1.3) to support a role for arrestin binding to the AT1R carboxyl-terminus as the mediator of ERK signaling by Gq/11-uncoupled AT1R.",

            "text": "Physical association between the AT1R and EGFR has also been reported (Seta and Sadoshima, 2003, Olivares-Reyes et al., 2005) and suggested as the mechanism of AngII-mediated EGFR transactivation (Seta & Sadoshima, 2003), a process whereby stimulation of GPCR leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR and the subsequent activation of downstream growth signaling pathways, such as ERK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (Fischer et al., 2003). EGFR transactivation contributes significantly to AngII growth effects in tumour cells (Schafer et al., 2004), the heart (Shah and Catt, 2004, Smith et al., 2004), kidney (Lautrette et al., 2005), vasculature (Suzuki et al., 2005, Nakashima et al., 2006) and skin (Yahata et al., 2006). In their paper, Seta and Sadoshima (2003) proposed that tyrosine319 in the AT1R carboxyl-terminus is phosphorylated during receptor activation and this mediates an interaction with EGFR, which drives the ensuing transactivation. They also reported that when the interaction between AT1R\u2013EGFR was prevented (by mutation of tyrosine319 to phenylalanine, Y319F), EGFR transactivation-dependent growth responses (ERK signaling and proliferation) were lost. It should be noted that, in direct contrast, Mifune et al. (2005) and Shah et al. (2004) recently reported that the Y319F AT1R mutant was not defective and retained the capacity to transactivate the EGFR. Instead, the data point to a mechanism more likely to involve a Gq/11-mediated activation of the metalloproteinase, ADAM17, and the cell surface shedding of the EGF ligand (heparin-binding EGF-like ligand) and the resulting binding and activation of EGFR. This latter mechanism is more in keeping with prevailing theories on GPCR\u2013EGFR transactivation (Fischer et al., 2003).",

(2003) reported that Gq/11 activation is also not required for \u03b2-arrestin 2 recruitment to the AT1R. Using confocal microscopy to follow the trafficking of GFP-labeled \u03b2-arrestin 2, they observed arrestin translocation to endocytic vesicles following AngII activation of a Gq/11-uncoupled AT1R mutant (DRY/AAY), a mutant that fails to generate inositol phosphates in response to AngII. \u03b2-Arrestin 2 trafficking was also achieved by stimulating the wild type AT1R with the substituted AngII ligand, Sar1Ile4Ile8-AngII, which shows no detectable inositol phosphate generation through the AT1R. Thus, receptor phosphorylation (Holloway et al., 2002) and arrestin recruitment (Wei et al., 2003) appear to be independent of the AT1R conformation necessary to activate its cognate G protein.",

Overexpression of arrestin leads to reduced inositol phosphate generation, consistent with its role in signal desensitization, but conversely promotes an enhanced ERK activation; this ERK is sequestered with the AT1R and arrestin within the cytoplasm on endosomes, which coincides with a decreased nuclear pool of activated ERK and diminished transcriptional responses (Tohgo et al., 2002). Depletion of \u03b2-arrestin 2 levels using RNAi significantly shifted the dose\u2013response curve for AngII-mediated ERK activation to the right, indicating an important contribution of arrestin to the sensitivity of AT1R-induced ERK signaling. In another study (Ahn et al., 2004b), this inhibitory effect was even more profound. As was the case for arrestin trafficking with internalized receptors (as mentioned above), the amount of activated ERK bound to arrestin correlates well with the stability of the AT1R\u2013arrestin interaction (Tohgo et al., 2003), which depends on the carboxyl-terminus of the receptor and its phosphorylation. Indeed, the inhibitory actions of \u03b2-arrestin 2 RNAi on AngII-induced ERK activation are nullified when AT1R are mutated or truncated at the carboxyl-terminus to prevent arrestin interaction (Wei et al., 2004).",

Based on RNAi approaches, this \u201cuncoupled\u201d ERK stimulation was completely dependent upon \u03b2-arrestin 2, whereas in the absence of \u03b2-arrestin 2, AngII-induced ERK activation via the wild type receptor was predominantly through mobilization of PKC activity. Temporally, the G protein-dependent portion of the AT1R-mediated ERK was rapid (maximum at 1\u20132 min) and transient and resulted in nuclear translocation of the activated ERK, whereas the G protein-independent ERK activation developed more slowly, was \u03b2-arrestin 2\u2014bound and sequestered in endosomes and sustained for up to 90 min (Ahn et al., 2004a). Finally, there appears to be a clear difference between \u03b2-arrestin 1 and \u03b2-arrestin 2 with regard to AT1R-activated ERK signaling (Ahn et al., 2004b): in contrast to \u03b2-arrestin 2, depletion of \u03b2-arrestin 1 using RNAi effectively enhances AngII-induced, as well as Sar1Ile4Ile8-AngII driven, ERK signaling through the wild type receptor.

            "text": "The principal discriminator between G protein-dependent and \u03b2-arrestin 2-dependent (i.e., Gq/11 independent) ERK activation is that the former generates a nuclear transcriptional response, typically associated with ERK activation and growth programs, whereas the latter sequesters activated ERK in the cytoplasmic vesicles and prevents subsequent nuclear events. Although the in vivo consequences for cellular growth of separate, spatially and temporally distinct pools of ERK are not yet evident, it would not be too surprising if somatic ablation of \u03b2-arrestin 2 in animals might yield pro-growth outcomes. In Drosophila, one form of arrestin is considered apoptotic, whereas the other is pro-survival (Satoh & Ready, 2005). Whether a similar scenario exist for \u03b2-arrestin 2, with antagonism provided by \u03b2-arrestin 1 as indicated by the in vitro studies (Ahn et al., 2004b), awaits experimental verification. One functional outcome that has been directly related to an AT1R\u2013\u03b2-arrestin 2/Gq/11-independent signal is that of chemotaxis\u2014the migration of cells in the direction of a chemical signal (Hunton et al., 2005). AngII mediated chemotaxis in HEK293 cells was mimicked by the uncoupled ligand, Sar1Ile4Ile8-AngII, and chemotaxis to both AngII and Sar1Ile4Ile8-AngII was abrogated by depletion of \u03b2-arrestin 2 by RNAi. Whether \u03b2-arrestin 1 can antagonize this chemotaxis is not clear, but \u03b2-arrestin 1 (and not \u03b2-arrestin 2) has been reported to act in co-ordination with Gq/11 to activate RhoA and cytoskeletal re-organization (Barnes et al., 2005).",

Based on its capacity to activate ERK in the absence of Gq/11-mediated signaling, they tested the effect of the AngII analog, Sar1Ile4Ile8-AngII, on drinking and salt intake. Their major findings were that Sar1Ile4Ile8-AngII acted as an antagonist of AngII-mediated inositol phosphate signaling in vitro and AngII-induced drinking in vivo. On its own, Sar1Ile4Ile8-AngII did not elicit a drinking response, but it did promote increased salt appetite. These data suggest that the immediate drinking response to AngII is a Gq/11-dependent mechanism, but that the more slowly developing increase in salt intake occurs via Gq/11-independent signals, presumably through arrestin-based ERK signaling.",

(2005) generated transgenic mice with a cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of either the wild type AT1R or a mutated, G protein-uncoupled version of the receptor (termed i2m), which carries mutations in the conserved DRY sequence at the junction of the third TM and intracellular loop 2. This mutation is analogous to the DRY mutants used by other investigators in the various in vitro experiments detailed above. Given the established role of Gq/11 signaling in cardiac hypertrophy, it might have been reasonable to hypothesize that the i2m transgenic mice would show diminished or ablated AngII-mediated hypertrophy. Instead, the mice displayed a profound cardiac hypertrophy to an extent that was even greater than that observed in the wild type AT1R transgenic mice, which were matched for equivalent levels of receptor expression. The i2m mice also displayed electrophysiological disturbances and developed more severe bradycardia with reduced cardiac function. Interestingly, compared to the wild type transgenics, the i2m mice showed less fibrosis and cell death, indicating that these actions of AT1R are via Gq/11 pathways. Overall, their study highlights the possible contribution of G protein-independent activities of AT1R in pathology. In their commentary that accompanied this paper upon its publication, Lefkowitz et al. (Rajagopal et al., 2005) provide compelling arguments and comparisons that suggest that the mechanistic basis for the G protein-independent events reported by Zhai et al. are closely aligned with the arrestin-scaffolding phenomenon.",

The mechanical stress associated with stretching of cardiomyocytes is thought to initiate these growth responses either directly or via release of trophic factors, such as AngII, endothelin, cytokines and transforming growth factor-\u03b2. Mechano-sensors, such as integrins, LIM proteins, the cytoskeleton and ion channels/exchangers, transmit the physical act of cellular stretching into typical growth-promoting signals (Sadoshima and Izumo, 1997, Ruwhof and van der Laarse, 2000), including Gq/11 activation, changes in calcium handling, MAPK, JAK/STAT (Pan et al., 1999), EGFR transactivation (Kippenberger et al., 2005) and Rho kinases (Aikawa et al., 1999). Under normal situations, this appears to require the AT1R, because non-peptide receptor antagonists block pressure overload hypertrophy, while the components of the RAS are upregulated by stretch in vivo and in isolated cells (Malhotra et al., 1999) as a way of resetting the gain of the system. However, mechanical stretch-induced hypertrophy has been shown to persist in vivo and in isolated cardiomyocytes from AT1AR knockout mice, prompting the suggestion that the AT1R is not absolutely essential (Harada et al., 1998, Kudoh et al., 1998). Moreover, various studies have reported that load-induced hypertrophy is mostly, partially, or not dependent on the release of AngII from cardiomyocytes in response to stretch.",

In their study, Zou et al. first confirmed that mechanical stretching of cardiomyocytes in culture could produce robust ERK activation (a hypertrophic signal), which was equivalent in strength to that observed when cells were stimulated with maximal concentrations of AngII. However, the level of AngII measured in the myocyte-conditioned media was very low and not significantly increased by stretch, indicating that AngII is unlikely to be the instigating factor. The stretch-conditioned media also failed to robustly activate a reporter cell line consisting of HEK293 cells stably transfected with the AT1R. Interestingly, stretching these HEK293-AT1R cells leads to readily demonstrable ERK activation, whereas it was not observed in naive HEK293 cells that do not express the AT1R. A neutralizing antibody to AngII could not negate stretch-induced ERK in the HEK293-AT1R cells, but it was completely blocked by the AT1R antagonist, candesartan. Together, these data indicate that mechanical stretch can activate the AT1R through a mechanism distinct from active secretion of its ligand and receptor engagement.",

Finally, in angiotensinogen knockout mice (which have no possibility of generating angiotensin peptides), cardiomyocyte ERK activation in response to stretch and in vivo pressure overload hypertrophy was retained, unambiguously discounting a role for the AngII ligand in this process. While no molecular explanation for the mechanism of stretch-induced AngII-independent AT1R was provided, the possibility that the AT1R receptor is physically complexed with integrins and other mechanosensors that are able to modify its active state is intriguing and worth further pursuit.",

Two AT1R mutants (K102A within TM3 and K199A within TM5) were identified that expressed at the cell surface but failed to bind AngII.

In this technique (for review, see Pfleger et al., 2006, Pfleger and Eidne, 2006), close proximity between protein partners (in this case putative receptor dimers) can be examined by fusing the receptors separately to either a luciferase enzyme or a modified form of GFP. Cells co-expressing the receptor fusions are treated with a substrate for the luciferase enzyme, which emits at a wavelength that excites GFP; if the GFP is in close enough proximity to absorb the energy, as would the case if the receptor pairs are dimerized, then it would emit at its characteristic wavelength and a BRET readout would be obtained. Using this approach, Hansen et al. (2004b) noted the constitutive formation of AT1R homodimers, which were not formed at the cell surface but rather during biosynthesis as the receptors trafficked through the endoplasmic reticulum; the constitutive nature of receptor dimerization was not affected by treatment with agonists or antagonists. Nevertheless, as discussed in Section 4.2.2.3, this dimerization reportedly promoted distinct receptor conformations with specific signaling outcomes.",

Similarly, the Mas receptor causes a constitutive BRET signal with the AT1R, but not the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor (Kostenis et al., 2005). At least for AT1R homodimers, the physical interaction between receptor pairs apparently happens during the process of biosynthesis and prior to export from the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent trafficking to the cell surface (Hansen et al., 2004b).

(AbdAlla et al., 2004) reported that, in activated monocytes, AT1R dimerization is catalyzed by an intracellular enzyme, factor XIIIA transglutaminase, which can covalently crosslink proteins via glutamines on one protein and lysines on another. Mutations of glutamine315 in the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminus of the AT1R abolished dimer formation identifying it as the likely residue targeted by the transglutaminase. This study was remarkable for 2 reasons: (1) because dimerization was agonist-induced and (2) as detailed in Section 4.2.2.4, AT1R dimers showed enhanced signaling and seemed to directly contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. Whether transglutaminase-mediated dimerization of AT1R can be independently confirmed and if it represents a general mechanism for GPCR dimer formation awaits further investigation.",

In contrast, the B2 bradykinin receptor in the AT1R\u2013B2 dimer showed reduced ligand affinity and decreased signaling upon bradykinin stimulation.

            "text": "In contrast, the heterodimers formed between AT1R\u2013AT2R and AT1R\u2013Mas appear to antagonize the Gq/11-mediated signaling of the AT1R (AbdAlla et al., 2001a, Kostenis et al., 2005). Thus, titration of the AT2R into cells co-expressing the AT1R led to a graded decrease in AngII-mediated inositol phosphate generation. Remarkably, this antagonism was not related to AngII binding to the AT2R, because the AT2R-selective non-peptide inhibitor, PD123319, did not prevent it nor was this antagonism lost for AT2R mutants defective in AngII binding. Similarly, co-expression of Mas with AT1R significantly reduced the potency and maximal efficacy of AngII to mobilize intracellular calcium through AT1R\u2013Gq/11 coupling (Kostenis et al., 2005), even though Mas expression caused a paradoxical increase in AT1R expression. Again, the effects of Mas were not modulated by its putative ligand, the AngII fragment, Ang1-7 (Santos et al., 2003). Finally, in Mas knockout mice, AT1R vasoconstriction was enhanced, consistent with an antagonistic role for Mas in a physiological setting. While these data strongly support the idea that direct AT1R\u2013Mas heterodmerization results in functional antagonism of the AT1R, a recent follow-up study has suggested that Mas can constitutively activate Gq/11 signaling and thereby lead to PKC mediated phosphorylation of the AT1R (Canals et al., 2006). So perhaps some of the inhibition of AngII signaling observed in the earlier study might relate to phosphorylation-mediated AT1R desensitization.",

In mouse cardiomyocytes, which co-express AT1R and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors, pharmacological blockade of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors with propranolol abolished AngII stimulation of contractile responses. This antagonism did not result from interference with AngII binding to AT1R, but rather through uncoupling of the AT1R from Gq/11. Conversely, AT1R antagonism with the specific, non-peptide antagonist, valsartan, prevented productive coupling of \u03b2adrenergic receptors to Gs in cardiac membranes and abrogated isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP generation in cells expressing both AT1R and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors. AngII- and isoproterenol-activated ERK signaling and receptor-mediated internalization was also transinhibited by reciprocal antagonism. This phenomenon extended to the in vivo situation, where a single dose of valsartan in mice markedly reduced the isopreterenol-induced increases in heart rate. The exact mechanism of this transinhibition remains unresolved but it may involve dimerization since the 2 receptors could be co-immunoprecipitated together from cells in a constitutive (ligand-independent) manner. Given that many of the hundreds of GPCR encoded by our genome are co-expressed in various cells, it will be of interest to determine how widespread this transinhibition phenomenon is and whether dimerization is the mechanism at play.",

Preeclampsia is a relatively common form of hypertension and proteinurea that occurs during pregnancy and is associated with increased sensitivity to AngII. Some have suggested that autoantibodies are generated against the extracellular regions of the AT1R that act as agonists and increase signaling (Wallukat et al., 1999, Dechend et al., 2004, Shah, 2006). Quitterer et al., on the other hand, reported increased AT1R\u2013B2 bradykinin receptor heterodimers in platelets and isolated vessels from women with preeclampsia compared to normotensive pregnant patients. Dimerized receptors displayed increased responsiveness to AngII, which required the G protein activation domain of the B2 receptor, and the AT1R in the dimer showed a decreased sensitivity to inactivation by oxidative stress. The implication from these results is that increased AT1R\u2013B2 receptor dimerization is a prelude to preeclampsia.",

Cys289Trp displayed an 11-fold decrease in potency to AngII, but retained full maximal activity; Phe204Ser had a > 50-fold reduction in potency with a 40% decrease in efficacy compared to wild type; whereas Gly45Arg shown a completely abrogated response to AngII. The inhibitory capacity of non-peptide AT1R antagonists was also blunted for Phe204Ser (\u223c 20-fold) and Cys289Trp (\u223c 10-fold). Whole cell radioligand binding assays and fluorescent detection of receptors demonstrated that the Gly45Arg was expressed at the cell surface, but completely lacked the capacity to bind AngII, whereas Phe204Ser and Cys289Trp had lower expression and affinity for ligand. Not surprisingly, therefore, inositol phosphate accumulation and ERK1/2 activation in response to AngII stimulation of these receptors was either reduced (Phe204Ser and Cys289Trp) or completely abolished (Gly45Arg).",

Preliminary surveys suggest frequencies of up to 5% for Gly45Arg (Rolfs et al., 1994), but this needs verification. So, what would be the outcome for a person carrying this mutation? Homozygous penetrance would yield an effective AT1R knockout individual, presumably with many of the renal abnormalities and blood pressure control issues observed in AT1R knockout rodent models (Oliverio et al., 1998). Even carrying the variants, Phe204Ser and Cys289Trp, would leave a person with a significantly reduced capacity to respond to AngII. Heterozygotes might expect normalcy if the wild type allele and the variant receptor proteins functioned independently, but what if these variants have the capacity to dimerize with the wild type and act as modifiers or dominant negative inhibitors? The effect of co-expressing these mutants with the wild type receptor was not attempted by Hansen et al. (2004a), but is worth considering given the accumulating evidence for functional receptor\u2013receptor dimerization and interactions (Section 4.2.2.3).",

Subsequent studies over the last decade have proven less convincing, with some studies reporting associations of A1166C with a range of cardiovascular disorders and others failing to do so (Miller and Scholey, 2004, Baudin, 2005). The link between the genotype and its phenotypic expression appears to be influenced by race, gender, underlying physiological perturbations (e.g., salt imbalance) and co-existing SNP in angiotensinogen and ACE. That A1166C resides in the 3\u2032-untranslated region of the gene means it does not change the amino acid sequence of the receptor and so how it affects receptor function may involve changes in mRNA stability or processing.

The net result of any stimulus necessarily involves the balance between the primary actions of AngII on AT1R and the activities of AngII and other angiotensin fragments on additional receptor types. They are complicated by the dimerization of angiotensin receptors and cross-regulation of their signal transduction pathways as well as additional processing and signaling capabilities recently attributed to renin and ACE/ACE2. They may reflect actions of angiotensin through a \u201cwild type\u201d receptor or one of the many variants that exist. Even in the reductionist's view of AngII-stimulated activation of a single AT1R species, one must consider actions mediated by the G protein as well as parallel functions driven by G protein-independent mechanisms. These may be synergistic or counteractive and might make important contributions to health and disease. A major challenge for researches in this area involves assimilating a vast array of literature and being able to integrate that information with their own data. The correct interpretation of experimental outcomes is acutely dependent upon a solid appreciation of the complex processes involved in angiotensin production, reception, signaling and regulation.",

The reported dimerization and antagonism of AT1R by AT2R (AbdAlla et al., 2001a) is nicely aligned with the prevailing notion that these receptors counteract each other's activities, yet we did not observe any obvious antagonism in isolated cardiomyocytes infected with AT1R and AT2R adenoviruses (D'Amore et al., 2005).

Further pharmacological characterization of human AT1R polymorphisms is required. Specifically, variants in the carboxyl-terminus of the receptor at position threonine336, which alter a well-established motif for receptor phosphorylation, arrestin binding and recruitment and internalization, might be expected to show enhanced receptor activation as a consequence of diminished receptor desensitization.
