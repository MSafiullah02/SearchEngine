            "text": "Pyridine-N-oxide derivatives have attracted (a) great interest in chemistry and biotechnology because of their accentuated oxidizing properties, high polarity, and their ability to be both charge donors and acceptors. Heterocyclic compounds with N-oxide groups have achieved widespread utility foremost because of their pronounced biological activity [1]. In the literature we can find the evidence of bactericidal, analgesic, anticonvulsant, apoptotic, and antimicrobial activity of N-oxides [2,3]. These properties allow to use N-oxides as inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase [4,5], as antiviral agent against various SARS corona virus strains [6], and as antiadhesive and quorum-sensitive inhibitor [7]. Some complexes with pyridine-N-oxides are used in agriculture to regulate plant growth rates [8]. According to numerous studies, the biochemical activity of N-oxides is due to the complexation with the metalloporphyrins in living organisms [[9], [10], [11]]. Obviously, the reactivity of N-oxides may vary due to different substituents in the ring [12]. The variation of the substituents gives wide possibilities to chemical modifications of N-oxides and allows to change their complexing properties, and, as the result, to influence the biological activity. Apparently, the substitution of pyridine-N-oxide with a strong electron-withdrawing -NO2 group would lead to an electron density redistribution, and thus would widen the scope of its reactivity. It is often assumed that the presence of the nitro group in substituted pyridine-N-oxides is responsible for a substantial increase in the antifungal activity [13]. Nitro-pyridine-N-oxides are also known to be used in photonics for design and development of new organic nonlinear optical (NLO) materials [[14], [15], [16], [17], [18]]. In order to elucidate the factors underlying these and other properties of pyridine-N-oxides a detailed information about the structural properties as well as about the electron density distribution in the molecules is needed.",

            "text": "The available literature data about molecular structure of gaseous N-oxides is not sufficient. Only four pyridine-N-oxides have been studied by gas-electron diffraction (GED). Chiang J.F. et al. [19,20] carried out GED studies of pyridine-N-oxide and three of its para-substituted compounds. However, the structural data reported in Refs. [20] should be criticized. Thus, e.g. N\u2013C bond lengths in 4-NO2-PyO, 4-Cl-PyO, 4-Me-PyO obtained by Chiang J.F. et al. [20] are even longer than r(C\u2013C) in the benzene ring, and are strongly overestimated compared to the calculated values [21] and X-ray crystallographic data [22,23]. Furthermore, the CNC bond angle values in the pyridine ring of 4-NO2-PyO and 4-Cl-PyO given in Ref. [20] are not consistent with sp2 hybridization of the nitrogen atom and do not agree with calculated [21] and X-ray data [22,23]. The discrepancies in molecular structure of substituted N-oxides according to GED by Chiang J.F. et al. [19,20] and other methods motivated us to perform a new gas-electron diffraction study of 4-substituted-N-oxide. The first GED reinvestigation was performed for 4-methylpyridine-N-oxide [24] because of the largest structural contradictions for this molecule. Now more sophisticated methods for the analysis of GED data are available, including the possibility of quantum chemical results to be used in the interpretation of the experimental data. This allows us to determine the structural parameters more precisely compared to the studies performed in 1982. The experimental structural data for 4-methylpyridine-N-oxide obtained in our study [24] are in a good agreement with the theoretical parameters as well as the experimental X-ray data.",

This work presents also a theoretical study (DFT and MP2) of the molecular structure of 4-NO2-PyO along with the related molecules.

Furthermore, view of the mass spectrum (Fig. 4) recorded simultaneously with the electron diffraction patterns corresponds to the mass spectrum of 4-NO2-PyO given in NIST database [43]. The theoretical sM(s) functions calculated with the following assumptions. According to quantum chemical calculations, a planar structure with C\n2v overall symmetry of the molecule was assumed. Independent rh1 parameters were used to describe the molecular structure. Starting parameters from B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ calculations were refined by a least-squares procedure of the molecular intensities. The differences between all C\u2013C bond distances, N\u2013O bond distances, and C\u2013N bond distances as well as between all C\u2013H bond distances were constrained to calculated values (B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ). Vibrational amplitudes were refined in groups with fixed differences. With the abovementioned assumptions, four bond distances and three bond angles (Table 2) were refined simultaneously with eight groups of vibrational amplitudes (Table 3). Only two correlation coefficients had absolute values larger than 0.7: (r(N1\u2013C3))/(r(C2\u2013C3)) = -0.90, and (\u2220N1C3C2)/(\u2220C3N1C4) = \u22120.75. The best agreement factor is Rf = 3.6%.

Taking into account that the structural parameters obtained by different methods have different physical meaning, we can note a good agreement of the values obtained in our research (therein and [24]) with the theoretical results (therein and [21]) and, also, with the parameters for the crystals [46,47] in contrast to the values recommended by Chiang J. F. et al. [20]. Apparently, some increase of the semipolar N\u2192O bond lengths in a crystal phase compared to the free molecules is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding. All parameters presented in Table 4 confirm the hyperconjugation in the pyridine ring and the sp2 hybridization concept of the nitrogen and carbon atoms in the ring. The exceptions are only the data by Chiang J. F. et al. [20], which are rather strange as we mentioned above. Unfortunately, large uncertainties in GED parameters for PyO [19] do not allow a comparison of the experimental structures. Thus, we can compare only the values obtained in our GED study (therein and [24]) and the calculated values. The structural data for free molecules in Table 4 show that the insertion of the methyl or nitro group in para \u2013 position to the PyO has no significant effect on the structural parameters of the pyridine ring, excluding only the ipso-angle \u2220 C2C1C5, which is changes from 117.7\u00b0 in PyO to 115.9\u00b0 in 4-Me-PyO and 119.9\u00b0 in 4-NO2-PyO (B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ). It is interesting to note, that the substituent effects on the geometry of heterocyclic ring are rather similar to the tendencies for the benzene ring [48,49]. Thus, the presence of the electron-withdrawing \u2013NO2 group leads to the increase of the ipso-angle, whereas electron-donating \u2013CH3 substituent produces the opposite effect.",

In all three cases the C\u2013C and C\u2013N bond orders in the ring, as well as the values of the distances from Table 2, Table 4 show that these bonds do not correspond to either single nor double bonds. This confirms the existence of \u03c0-conjugation in the pyridine rings. The C1\u2013N2 bond distance as well as Q(C1\u2013N2) for 4-NO2-PyO corresponds to the single C\u2013N bond in contrast to the assumption about conjugation of \u2013NO2 group with the pyridine ring. One can note that Wiberg bond index Q(N1\u2013O1) in all three molecules cannot be interpreted as exact single or double bond. Furthermore, the introduction of various substituents in the pyridine ring may either facilitate the transfer of electron density from oxygen to the heterocycle and reduce the negative charge on the oxygen atom or, contrariwise, increase the negative charge on the oxygen. Thus, the introduction of electron-donating \u2013CH3 substituent increases the bond length N\u2192O, reduces the correspondent Wiberg bond index and significantly increases the electron density on oxygen. In contrast, the introduction of electron-withdrawing -NO2 group in the pyridine ring reduces the bond distance r(N\u2192O), increases the Wiberg bond index Q(N\u2192O) and, consequently, makes this bond more rigid and reduces the negative charge on oxygen. Obviously, in this case the presence of strong acceptor -NO2 group results in a withdrawal of charges from the ring atoms and the N-oxide oxygen. Surprisingly, the total natural charge of the pyridine ring decreases with the insertion both -NO2 or methyl group to para-position.",

[20] have concluded that the aromaticity increases in the series: 4-nitropyridine-N-oxide (4-NO2-PyO), 4-chloropyridine-N-oxide (4-Cl-PyO), pyridine-N-oxide (PyO), 4-methylpyridine-N-oxide(4-Me-PyO). However, as noted above, the average values of the bond lengths in the pyridine ring of the molecules studied (Table 4) do not change with the insertion of the substituent in para-position. To study the substituent effect on the aromaticity the nuclear independent chemical shifts NICS(1) have been calculated. NICS(1) values correspond to the negative isotropic shielding (in ppm) at 1 \u00c5 above the ring plane [[50], [51], [52]]. It is of important to note that in a vast number of papers it has been elaborately shown that (depending on the size of the ring) the in-plane aromaticity which is indicated by the isotropic NICS(0) value contains considerable contribution of in-plane \u03c3-aromaticity resulting from the diamagnetic shielding of the \u03c3 electronic framework. Thus the NICS(1) value regards to be a better descriptor of the \u03c0 contribution to aromaticity due to the apparent decrease of the local contributions of the \u03c3 framework at larger distances from the ring center. All NICS values were computed by employing the standard GIAO method implemented in the Gaussian software package by using B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ approximation. The calculated values of NICS(1): \u22127.29 (PyO), \u22126.95 (4-NO2-PyO) and \u22127.18 (4-Me-PyO) are quite close to each other. Some decrease of NICS(1) for 4-NO2-PyO can hardly be considered as noticeable effect of the substituent to the aromaticity.",

Bader [25]. The set of topological properties of \u03c1(r) has been obtained for the molecular wave function of PyO and 4-NO2-PyO at B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ approach. The molecular graphs and net atomic charges for C\n2v structures of PyO and 4-NO2-PyO are illustrated in Fig. 6\n. The Laplacian map in the plane of pyridine ring is presented on Fig. 7\nand shows the regions of local charge depletion (\u22072\n\u03c1\nb > 0) and concentration (\u22072\n\u03c1\nb < 0) in PyO and 4-NO2-PyO molecules. The most important topological properties of electron density at the bond critical points (BCP) are summarized in Table 6\n. It is clear that the charge densities at BCP (\u03c1\nb) are correlated with the correspondent bond distance. The negative values of the Laplacian (\u22072\n\u03c1\nb) and total electronic energy density (H\nb) indicate the occurrence of shared interaction which implies a covalent nature of the chemical bonds for both molecules studied. The values of the electronic delocalization index\u03b4 can be considered as the bond order characteristics. These values (see Table 6) are in satisfactory agreement with the Wiberg bond indexes (Table 5) and confirm that the bonds in the pyridine ring are neither single nor double. As additional criteria of \u03c0-bonding contribution the bond ellipticity \u03b5 is used in QTAIM. Among the endocyclic bonds of 4-NO2-PyO molecule the highest value of \u03b5 = 0.233 is for C2\u2013C3 bond. Accordingly, this bond possesses highest \u03c0-character in the ring (in comparison \u03b5 = 0.200 for benzene [53]). Surprisingly, the ellipticity value \u03b5 = 0.172 for C1\u2013N2 bond is rather large, that could be a sign of the partial \u03c0-character of this bond in spite of the delocalization index value (\u03b4 = 0.887) corresponds to single (sigma) bond, as well as a bond r(C1\u2013N2) length.",

Some differences of the net atomic charges obtained by NPA, Natural Population Analysis, (Table 5) and by QTAIM approach (Table 7) should be noted, although the general trends in the values remain from PyO to 4-NO2-PyO. According to QTAIM results, the atomic charge on the ipso carbon atom C1 in 4-NO2-PyO significantly changes in comparison with PyO because of a neighbor to acceptor \u2013NO2 group. The electron density on C2, C5 and N1 atoms in 4-NO2-PyO is decreased also due to negative mesomeric effect which takes place inside the pyridine ring. The total charge q(ring) of the heterocyclic ring in PyO has a positive value + 0.274e which is increased up to +0.626e when \u2013NO2 group has been introduced. Indeed, the electron-withdrawing \u2013NO2 group is a part of \u03c0-conjugated system of the molecule, and as result electron density is shifted from O1 atom and pyridine ring towards the substituent. The negative total charge of \u2013NO2 group q(R) has a value \u22120.529e, that additionally supports the suggestion mentioned above. We would like to point out the magnitude of electron density into pyridine ring is changed quantitatively but topologically electron density distribution does not changed dramatically between non- and substituted pyridine-N-oxides (see Fig. 7 and Table 6). At the same time a decrease of the charge on O1 atom can lead to a decrease in the complex formation ability of the substance.",

            "text": "We can suspect the similar changes in electron density for crystal phase as for free molecules observed. Indeed, the PyO molecules are aggregated into crystal pack mostly due to hydrogen bonds between oxygen atom of semipolar bond N\u2192O and hydrogen atoms in 2- and 6- ring positions of neighboring molecules PyO [23]. According to Wang Y. et al. [23] the crystal pack of 4-nitropyridine-N-oxide is formed by parallel layers. Furthermore, the oxygen atom of N\u2192O semipolar bond of one molecule is situated approximately above the center of N\u2013C distance between nitro group and pyridine ring of another molecule, wherein the N\u22efO distance is shorter than the C\u22efO distance (2.99 \u00c5 and 3.06 \u00c5 correspondingly). The reason of layered structure could be an appearance of additional hydrogen bonds due to negatively charged oxygen atoms of \u2013NO2 group and increased positive charges of the hydrogen atoms in 4-NO2-PyO molecule in comparison to pyridine-N-oxide. Such assumption fully corresponds to net atomic charges distribution obtained by QTAM for free PyO and 4-NO2-PyO molecules (see Fig. 6). The mutual molecules position in crystal can be explained by electrostatic attraction between negatively charged oxygen and positively charged nitrogen and carbon atoms. Moreover according to result of calculations the charge of nitrogen atom in \u2013NO2 is larger than that for carbon (+0.402e and +0.241e correspondingly), it is the possible explanation for shorter N\u22efO contact in comparison to C\u22efO distance. As we can see the simple electrostatic model which employing the Bader's atomic charges of free 4-NO2-PyO molecule allows describing correctly the arrangement of these molecules inside the crystal. Galm\u00e9s B. et al. [54] had attempted to characterize the geometric features of the nitropyridine-1-Oxides complexes employing the molecular electrostatic potential and results of QTAIM. The position of 4-NO2-PyO molecules in the crystal pack has been described as interaction between \u0440-hole donor nitro group of one molecule and oxygen atom of N\u2192O semipolar bond of another. Both conceptions work well however the simple electrostatic model of atomic charges seems to be easier for understanding.",

These features confirm that N1\u2192 O1 bond is predominantly covalent and possess the cylindrical symmetry.

The electron density redistribution with the substituent introduction results foremost in the values of heterocycle ipso-angle.

At the same time the electron density concentration is substantially high in comparison with the values for all bonds in heterocycle and the value of the electronic delocalization index for N1\u2192O1 bond is rather large, that is usually appropriate to the bonds with \u03c0-contribution.
