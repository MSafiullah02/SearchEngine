More recent data from a prospective study in children and adults with neutropenia showed a median incidence of infectious complications of 43% and a rate of 22.8 episodes per 1000 DN; bacteremia was diagnosed in 21% of the episodes and mold infections in 5%, with rates of 10.2 and 2.4 for 1000 DN, respectively.7 As shown in Table 310-2, the rate of infections is higher after high-intensity chemotherapies and lower after maintenance treatment. Although the epidemiology of infections has been studied more extensively in children, in general, data from adults report higher rates of infectious complications compared with pediatric populations. The majority of primary febrile episodes usually occur soon (a few days) after the onset of neutropenia.",

Indeed, it has been demonstrated that in patients receiving HSCT, the fever is strictly related to the severity of mucosal barrier injury, independently of the severity and duration of myelosuppression. Mucositis is one of the most important factors predisposing to bloodstream infections, both caused by bacteria and by Candida. The damage of mucosal barrier allows colonizing pathogens to enter the bloodstream, where, in the absence of granulocytes, severe infection can rapidly develop, even in case of a low bacterial load. Mucositis, with or without neutropenia, might also be responsible for severe oral and intestinal infections. The pathogenesis and the role of mucositis after chemotherapy is described in detail elsewhere (see Chapter 309).",

The incidence of CVC-related infections should be kept at the minimum by several educational and organizational measures, such as repeated teaching sessions for patients, parents, and staff, or establishing teams dedicated to the insertion and maintenance of intravascular devices. Technical measures that have been suggested include the use of chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings or sponges and the antiseptic/antimicrobial coating of intravascular catheters, for example, with chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine. The benefit of their routine use depends on their cost, the observed rate and outcome of CVC infections, and, in case of antibiotic-impregnated devices, on the risk of inducing antimicrobial resistance.",

For example, in nonleukemic patients receiving less intensive chemotherapy, decreased levels of mannose-binding protein were associated with an increased risk of infection (49.9 vs. 29.6/1000 days at risk, P = .01). This effect, less evident in the context of prolonged neutropenia, was not confirmed in all the studies. However, in a recent study of 269 children with cancer, mannose-binding lectin deficiency influenced both the incidence and the severity of febrile neutropenia.39 Polymorphisms of Toll-like receptors and other components of innate immunity have been associated with an increased risk of invasive aspergillosis, both in cancer patients (including recipients of HSCT) and in other immunocompromised patients.40 The future will tell us whether genetic polymorphisms, alone or in combination, have an actual impact and might dictate prophylactic or therapeutic approaches.",

            "text": "As already mentioned, in recent years, monoclonal antibodies and other pharmaceutical compounds, specifically engineered for targeting cells or cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of specific diseases, have been introduced in the armamentarium of antineoplastic chemotherapy. These include biologic response modifiers and protein kinase inhibitors. Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody against the CD52 receptor that is used in the treatment of acute or chronic lymphocytic leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This monoclonal antibody has a clear role in increasing the infection risk because it is associated with long-lasting and profound lymphopenia. Bacteremias, invasive fungal diseases (including pneumocystosis), several viral diseases, and tuberculosis have been all described in association with this drug. A low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (with a possible cutoff of 200 CD4+/mm3) has been indicated as one of the most important factors related to the development of infectious complications. Obviously, infections seem to be more common (with more severe clinical pictures) in patients previously treated with other antineoplastic protocols. Rituximab is an anti-CD20 (B-cell) antibody that causes a prolonged (2 to 6 months median, but sometimes more) suppression of immunoglobulin production. It has been associated with reactivation or acute exacerbation of viral hepatitis (both hepatitis B virus [HBV] and C virus [HCV]) and, more rarely, with disseminated parvovirus infections, enteroviral meningitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, babesiosis, and pneumocystosis.41 Bacterial and fungal diseases have also been described, usually when rituximab was administered in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. For other anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, such as ibritumomab, tositumomab, ofatumumab, and ocrelizumab, less data on infectious complications exist. Such monoclonal antibodies were reported to cause severe myelosuppression, with a spectrum of infectious complications somewhat similar to those associated with classic cytostatic drugs. It is noteworthy that patients receiving antilymphocytic monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD52 and/or anti-CD20) for relapsing diseases (i.e., after previous prolonged chemotherapy cycles) present more frequent and severe complications compared with those who receive front-line therapies. Bevacizumab is another monoclonal antibody that targets vascular endothelial growth factor and is used in colon, kidney, brain, or lung cancer. Febrile neutropenia and bacterial infections have been reported in approximately 10% of patients, usually when the drug was used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Cetuximab (approved for colon, head, and neck cancer) and panitumumab (approved for colon cancer) both have the epidermal growth factor receptor as their main target of activity and cause important dermatologic toxicity, such as rash, skin drying and fissuring, or paronychial inflammation, with infectious complications in up to 30% of patients, including sepsis caused by S. aureus. Trastuzumab reacts with the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and is administered, usually in combination with standard chemotherapies, for treatment of HER2-positive breast or gastric cancers. Infections associated with this compound are generally mild, though not infrequent, and they may exacerbate chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Small molecules with protein kinase activity targeting oncogenic tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL (breakpoint cluster region\u2013Abelson murine leukemia), such as imatinib, desatinib, and nilotinib, are used in patients with both acute and chronic leukemia and solid tumors, even for very long periods of time. Infectious complications seem to be similar to those observed with other immunosuppressive drugs affecting mechanisms of cell-mediated immunity, such as pneumocystosis and viral diseases, including reactivation of hepatitis. Because of the absence of major myelosuppression, there is no apparent increase in the rates of bacterial or fungal infections.26 Finally, there are kinase inhibitors, such as sunitinib and sorafenib, that are used before nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma and for hepatocellular carcinoma. These drugs apparently do not increase the risk of surgical infections, although one of them (sunitinib) has been associated with necrotizing fasciitis, respiratory infections, and sepsis.",

Even in randomized, placebo-controlled trials and in large open-label studies, it is difficult to establish the rate of infectious complications. The main reason is that these trials were powered to measure efficacy but not safety, and if the effect is very rare, it might go undetected. Second, there are many confounding factors because new drugs are usually used together with old or classic therapies, making it difficult, if not impossible, to evaluate their respective role. In addition, the trials did not use the same definitions of infectious complications or simply did not pay enough attention to diagnosing them. Sadly, in some cases, there was a tendency toward minimization and covering. Finally, in some cases, there was not enough attention to forecast the risk of infection. This is the case of eculizumab used for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, which targets the C5 complement component. As widely known among infectious disease physicians dealing with infections in immunocompromised hosts, the inherited deficiency of the C5 complement component is associated with repeated episodes of meningococcal disease. Thus, this risk might have been forecast.",

For example, among patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis undergoing peritonectomy and intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemotherapy, the proportion of infectious complications was rather high, varying from 24% to 36%,42, 43, 44 with more than two infectious episodes per patient. The rate of infectious complications is lower in other oncologic surgeries. In breast cancer, surgical site infection is a complication in 4% to 8% of cases, depending whether breast reconstruction is performed in one or two steps and whether surgery follows previous chemotherapy cycles.45, 46 In case of malignant biliary obstruction, early infectious complications after percutaneous biliary stent insertion were present in 6.5% of patients.47 Similar incidence was reported in patients undergoing surgery for hepatocellular or metastatic carcinoma (3% to 11%), and this incidence was apparently lower than in surgery for nonmalignant conditions such as hepatolithiasis (24%).48 The rate of infectious complications after hepatectomy for hepatocarcinoma was associated with surgical risk factors such as bile leakage and blood loss.49 A similar incidence of surgical site infections was reported after elective colon and rectal surgery (9% and 18%, respectively),50 and after orthopedic surgery (9.5%).51 Of interest, in the latter study, the use of an implant or allograft did not represent a risk factor for infectious complications.51 Finally, postoperative respiratory infections have been reported in nearly 4% of patients undergoing surgery for lung cancer, and they occurred more frequently in the presence of advanced age, impaired respiratory function, advanced pathologic stage, and induction chemotherapy.",

However, more recently, an increase in the frequency of bacteremias caused by gram-negative rods has been reported in many centers worldwide, with gram-negative pathogens becoming either predominant or at least as frequent as gram-positive pathogens. This trend has been observed also in the results from a recent literature review and European surveillance study performed in 2011 in 39 hematology centers from 18 countries for the Fourth European Conference of Infections in Leukemia (ECIL-4).52a As shown in Figure 310-1\n, gram-negative pathogens are almost as frequent as gram-positive ones, with the gram-positive versus gram-negative ratio in bloodstream infections at 60% versus 40% and 55% versus 45% in the literature review and ECIL-4 surveillance, respectively. The detailed etiology was similar (see Fig. 310-1) in the literature review and surveillance study, with slightly increased rates of enterococci and Enterobacteriaceae and a decreased rate of P. aeruginosa in the ECIL-4 surveillance study. These changes in etiology seemed to be accompanied by an important and alarming increase in the proportion of resistant pathogens, such as ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, VRE, or, the most worrisome, carbapenem-resistant gram-negative pathogens, both P. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae\u2014mostly Klebsiella pneumoniae. Last but not least, in leukemia patients, most of staphylococci are resistant to methicillin, whereas most of gram-negative pathogens are fluoroquinolone resistant. Of note, the rates of resistance were generally higher in southern and eastern Europe than in northern and western Europe.",

Of interest, in non-neutropenic febrile cancer patients, gram-negative pathogens are the most frequently isolated, followed by gram-positive pathogens, yeasts, and filamentous fungi, probably in relation to severe gastrointestinal mucositis.54 CVC-related bacteremias are generally caused by gram-positive cocci (especially coagulase-negative staphylococci) that are isolated in more than 50% of the episodes, compared with the rate of 25% to 40% for gram-negative rods. The source of infection is likely to be partially different between gram-positive and negative CVC-related bacteremias. In both cases, contamination of skin or hub caused by incorrect catheter management is pivotal, although many gram-positive cocci come directly from the patient's skin flora. Infusate contamination is a rare but possible event, and in this case, gram-negative rods, such as Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Achromobacter, Serratia, and Pseudomonas (other than P. aeruginosa), are more likely involved.

The majority of episodes are caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, although some centers report a predominance of infections caused by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus terreus.23, 59\nAspergillus species are ubiquitous molds whose primary ecologic niche is represented by decomposing vegetable material, including potted plants, soil, flowers, and carpets. In healthy individuals, Aspergillus conidia are trapped in the upper respiratory tract, and only a small proportion of them enter the lower airways, where Aspergillus may become an allergen. In immunocompromised patients, especially those with hematologic malignancies or after allogeneic transplantation, spores can germinate and cause an invasive disease. Thus, invasive aspergillosis in patients with malignancy or receiving HSCT is an endemic disease, which is usually community acquired and endogenous, although epidemic outbreaks of exogenous infection associated with massive environmental exposures (in and outside the hospital) can occur. The incidence of invasive aspergillosis depends on the patient's age (lower in those younger than 10 years), the underlying malignancy, and its treatment, being the highest in patients with prolonged neutropenia, followed by those receiving high doses of steroid therapy. In a multicenter Italian study, the incidence of aspergillosis among hematologic patients varied from 7.9% in acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia; 4.3% in acute lymphoblastic leukemia; 2.3% in chronic myelogenous leukemia; to less than 1% in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, non\u2013Hodgkin's lymphoma, and multiple myeloma.23 A recently described risk group is represented by patients with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders, probably resulting from more intensive treatment protocols.59 The incidence of invasive aspergillosis after autologous HSCT is low (0.3% to 2%), and it occurs during neutropenia preceding the engraftment.23, 60, 61, 62\n",

The first approach relied on the administration of nonabsorbable antibiotics aimed at totally (including anaerobes) or partially (excluding anaerobes) suppressing the intestinal bacterial flora and preventing the acquisition of exogenous organisms. Oral gentamicin, vancomycin, and nystatin were used. Subsequently, absorbable drugs\u2014first, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), usually given in combination with oral nystatin or amphotericin B\u2014and then fluoroquinolones, were introduced. A meta-analysis published in 2005 showed that prophylaxis during neutropenia with absorbable drugs, especially quinolones, significantly reduced the risk of death and the rates of both unexplained fever and documented bacterial infections.15 No significant increase in the rate of fluoroquinolone resistance was found, although no study was designed to evaluate any impact on resistance rates. As is the case in many meta-analyses, an important limitation to this conclusion was the poor quality of some studies included and the fact that many of them had been performed decades ago, when the situation in terms of bacterial epidemiology and resistance patterns was completely different. Soon after this meta-analysis was performed, the Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche Maligne dell'Adulto (GIMEMA)13 published a randomized clinical trial of 760 consecutive patients with acute leukemia or lymphoma (only 6% of patients had other solid tumors) that confirmed the value of quinolone prophylaxis in reducing the number of bacterial infections. The difference in survival was not statistically significant, although a trend favoring prophylaxis was observed. The proportion of resistant strains did not change over time when comparing two studies performed by the same group in different years, and the authors concluded that the pressure exerted by the use of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis might have been counterbalanced by the decreased need to use empirical antibacterial therapy, thus limiting the risk of emergence of resistance to the drugs used for empirical therapy. These data were encompassed in a new meta-analysis, published in 2012, that included 190 trials (involving 13,579 patients) conducted between 1973 and 2010. The results confirmed that antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduced the risk of death from all causes and the risk of infection-related death when compared with placebo or no intervention.69 The estimated number needed to treat (NNT) was 34 to prevent one death for all-cause mortality and 48 for infection-related mortality. Prophylaxis also significantly reduced the occurrence of fever and clinically or microbiologically documented infections. Again the question regarding antibacterial resistance selection was not answered. In fact, data on this pivotal topic were available for only six trials (3%) and 336 patients (2%). Finally, it must be stressed that no study evaluated the effects of repeated cycles of prophylaxis administered during the whole course of antineoplastic chemotherapy. All the aforementioned data and considerations on chemoprophylaxis are valid for patients with hematologic malignancies or undergoing HSCT because these populations represented the vast majority of patients enrolled in these clinical trials.",

            "text": "Invasive mycoses are severe complications of antineoplastic chemotherapy, especially in patients with acute leukemia, and their role has increased in recent years. Although fungal infections usually represent no more than 10% of all infections (see Tables 310-2 and 310-3), their associated mortality is very high. Therefore, preventing invasive fungal infections has always been considered a desirable approach. Two main drugs have been used in recent years for antifungal prophylaxis in acute leukemia patients: fluconazole (active against yeasts but not molds) and posaconazole (mold-active prophylaxis). Meta-analyses showed that the use of fluconazole is effective in preventing fungal infections in allogeneic HSCT and in acute myeloid leukemia and suggest some possible benefit in other populations, if the incidence of invasive fungal disease is higher than 15%. Fluconazole reduced the incidence of Candida infections (albicans and non-albicans) but obviously did not diminish the risk of aspergillosis. In recent years, a study of oral posaconazole in adults receiving multiple cycles of chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome showed a statistically significant advantage in terms of mortality and a 6% absolute reduction in the relative risk of invasive mycosis, from 8% to 2% (primary end point), with a significant reduction also in the cumulative risk of infection compared with standard prophylaxis (fluconazole or itraconazole).72 The fact that the difference in mortality was not confirmed in a multivariate analysis including baseline and time-dependent factors potentially able to affect survival, limits substantially the certainty of the effect of posaconazole on survival benefit. Given the reduction in the incidence of fungal infections and the incidence observed in the control group, the number needed to prevent one proven/probable invasive mycosis was 16, and the number needed to prevent one fungal infection\u2013related death was 27.73 However, with lower infection rate and lower mycosis-related mortality, the number needed to prevent one infection or one death would be higher, and this observation underlines the need for every center to obtain accurate information on the local epidemiology of invasive mycosis and therefore to tailor the results of clinical trials to the local situation. Until recently, posaconazole was only available as an oral solution and absorption was highly variable, depending heavily on ingestion of a fatty meal or on subdividing the daily dose (three to four times a day). Moreover, GI side effects were not unusual, although administration through a nasogastric tube in patients who cannot swallow was associated with a reduction of plasma levels. Whether or not there is a need for therapeutic drug monitoring with posaconazole is still controversial. Recent introduction of two new formulations of posaconazole (i.e., intravenous and oral capsules of which absorption is not influenced by gastric pH) might resolve the problem of bioavailability of the oral solution. Of note, posaconazole has been also effective in reducing the incidence of invasive fungal infections in allogeneic HSCT recipients with graft-versus-host disease.74 Similarly, voriconazole, another mold-active azole, has also been studied in the setting of allogeneic HSCT, including the neutropenic preengraftment phase.75, 76 In the first study, primary end point (survival) was not met, but voriconazole prophylaxis reduced the incidence of invasive aspergillosis, although not in a statistically significant way.75 Efficacy was more evident among patients undergoing transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia as an underlying disease. In the second study, voriconazole was superior to itraconazole in a composite end point, in which the main driver of success was better tolerability, not efficacy. Unfortunately, the design of the voriconazole studies was suboptimal because, in both cases, low- and high-risk patients were included, with consequent dilution of the possible prophylactic effect. Issues related to therapeutic drug monitoring are also relevant for voriconazole, in this case not caused by problems with oral absorption but as a result of its complex and variable metabolism. In addition, triazoles (especially voriconazole) are a known cause of complex drug interactions with other drugs metabolized via the cytochrome P-450 system, with the risk of reducing the efficacy of treatments and increasing the incidence of (severe) adverse events.77\n",

In addition, pneumocystosis has been associated with administration of alemtuzumab, which causes profound depletion of T lymphocytes, rarely with rituximab, and, in one case, also with the multikinase inhibitor desatinib.

            "text": "An important change in the natural history of infections in cancer patients has been the increasing number of patients with solid tumors who are treated with high-dose chemotherapy and therefore develop neutropenia and fever. However, patients with solid tumors rarely receive regimens that make them neutropenic for more than 7 to 8 days, and neutropenia is rarely severe. In most cases, these patients are clinically stabilized within 48 hours after the appearance of fever and are without fever within 3 to 4 days. According to these observations, the empirical therapy of febrile neutropenia in cancer patients should not be the same in every situation and in every patient but should be modulated according to individual risk factors. On the basis of this concept, several studies have been performed with the aim of identifying a priori, in a scientific way and not empirically, the patient populations at low risk of a severe infection. The Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) score has been shown suitable to identify patients with low probability of complicated febrile neutropenia (Table 310-6\n). A risk-index score greater than 21 identified low-risk patients, with positive and negative predictive values of 91% and 36%, respectively. At this threshold, sensitivity and specificity were 71% and 68%, respectively, with a 30% misclassification rate. No study addressed the issue of identifying patients at high risk, although one might infer that in the MASCC score, subjects with a low index are not low-risk patients. Studies in children evaluating risk of complicated outcome were less successful. Although six pediatric stratification systems for identifying low-risk patients were determined in a retrospective analysis, none of them could be validated in separate data sets. Thus, at present, no recommendation of a single low-risk prediction rule can be made for predicting specific outcomes in children, although locally derived risk stratification strategies can be incorporated into routine clinical management.100 If low-risk patients can be reliably identified, the next logical step would be to try to discharge these patients early or even to treat them as outpatients or at home. The mandatory conditions for home or outpatient treatment of febrile neutropenia include presence of a reliable caregiver at home, a stable intravenous access, hospital proximity and adequate transportation, and the necessary facilities (telephone, running water, heating, and refrigeration).",

Although the results of clinical trials play a pivotal role in the choice of an effective regimen, other factors to be considered include local bacterial epidemiology and resistance patterns, local antibiotic policies, antibiotic toxicity, and cost. In recent years, antibiotic resistance, local stewardship policies, cost, and shortage of new antibiotics, especially against gram-negative organisms, have dramatically complicated treatment choices and forced physicians to diversify empirical regimens based on colonization, local epidemiology, antibiotic policies, and, last but not least, patient safety. Patient-related factors, such as clinical presentation, organ failure, status of the underlying disease, and expected duration of neutropenia, are all extremely important in this therapeutic diversification. The key time points for managing the high-risk neutropenic patient with fever and infection are day 0, when the patient is evaluated, cultures are drawn, and antibiotic therapy is started, and day 3 or 4, when results come back from the laboratory and the patient is reevaluated. This time line does not indicate that empirical regimen needs to be left unchanged for 3 days, but it highlights mandatory reevaluation and, if applicable, discontinuation of a part of empirical strategy that has not been confirmed necessary. In fact, empirical antibiotic regimen should be modified anytime, based on patient's clinical conditions (need for broader coverage and deescalation strategy in case of sudden deterioration) and microbiologic results.",

Monotherapy with an anti-Pseudomonas \u03b2-lactam antibiotic (ceftazidime, cefepime, or piperacillin-tazobactam) probably represents the most rational approach in clinical centers without evidence of resistance phenomena, with the carbapenems used as second-line therapy in failing patients with or without documented infections. In a standard clinical situation, combining an aminoglycoside with a \u03b2-lactam is not deemed necessary because of possible increased toxicity and no clinical advantage in efficacy. This was clearly shown in a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial comparing piperacillin-tazobactam with placebo versus the same drug with amikacin.102 The escalation approach avoids universal, and usually unnecessary, upfront use of antibiotics with the broadest spectrum, such as carbapenems or combinations with aminoglycosides or glycopeptides, and consequently minimizes potential disadvantages, such as selection of resistant pathogens or toxicity. However, in the light of increasing resistance, there is a growing concern that if the initial regimen fails to cover the pathogen responsible for infection, the prognosis is worsened significantly.",

Because use of carbapenems and vancomycin has been associated with emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and VISA, the key point of the deescalation strategy is reassessing the antibiotic treatment after 48 to 96 hours and downgrading therapy to a narrow-spectrum regimen whenever possible. The very broad coverage is discontinued by deescalating once the susceptibility of the isolated pathogen is known and/or patient clinical conditions improve. Examples of an extreme initial regimen in a deescalation strategy regimen include the use of colistin, daptomycin, tigecycline, or linezolid, if a patient is colonized with MDR gram-negative or gram-positive pathogens.

In general, good clinical practice in infectious diseases suggests that persistence of fever does not neces\u00adsarily mean failure of a given antibiotic regimen, especially if the patient is otherwise clinically stable. A neutropenic patient with bacteremia might require 2 to 7 days to defervescence, even if the isolated pathogen is susceptible to the allocated antibiotic regimen.

This practice is based on autopsy studies showing fungal infections undetected during life and on two randomized studies that enrolled, in total, less than 200 patients.110, 110a, 110b, 110c These studies were not double blind or placebo controlled and did not conclude that there was an unequivocal advantage of the empirical antifungal approach. In both studies, the statistical power of the observed results was very small. Nevertheless, empirical antifungal therapy in persistently febrile neutropenic patients without a documented infection has become common practice in many cancer centers worldwide, and numerous drugs have been tested for this indication. Except for the first studies, which used persistence of fever and survival as the main end point, almost all other studies used a composite end point, which included five criteria: defervescence, no discontinuation for toxicity, treatment of baseline fungal infections, prevention of breakthrough fungal infections, and survival. In general, no drug has been demonstrated significantly more effective than the control, and differences were only based on lower toxicity. Of interest, a meta-analysis of the six trials where empirical treatment was compared with no treatment or preemptive therapy confirmed that empirical antifungal treatment was associated with a lower rate of (diagnosed) invasive fungal diseases, but gave no significant advantage in terms of overall mortality.110 The aim of empirical therapy was to treat as early as possible both candidiasis and aspergillosis. However, when fluconazole prophylaxis became widely used and reduced the incidence of Candida infections, it became evident that empirical therapy was mainly directed against Aspergillus.",

            "text": "In recent years, awareness has grown that the empirical approach results in a tremendous overtreatment of just one symptom (fever) and has encouraged development of a preemptive or, maybe better, diagnostic-driven approach, aimed at treating a fungal disease when highly suggestive, although not conclusive, diagnostic criteria are present (not just fever). In the diagnostic-driven strategy, clinical considerations (fever, thoracic pain, cough), biologic markers (e.g., Aspergillus galactomannan in serum or bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL] fluid, cytologic detection of fungal hyphae, or positive culture of sputum or BAL fluid), and imaging data (e.g., chest computed tomography [CT] whole-volume scanning with thin-slice reconstruction preferable to high-resolution CT scanning) are combined together to obtain the highest possible diagnostic likelihood of aspergillosis and consequently to start therapy. Whether or not any pulmonary infiltrate is enough or typical radiologic signs of invasive aspergillosis are required to start antifungal therapy is a matter of debate. Some studies analyzed the feasibility of this approach in adult patients. The first one concluded that the diagnostic-driven approach was feasible, associated with less use of antifungal therapy, and without increased mortality with respect to historical controls. Of particular interest, in this study, 10 patients, who were diagnosed with positive galactomannan and CT scanning, would have not received any antifungal therapy with the classic empirical approach because they were afebrile.111 In the first randomized, noninferiority trial, which compared the empirical and preemptive approaches (defined differently from the previous study), no difference was found in the primary end point (survival). As expected, in the arm of preemptive therapy, in which an active diagnostic workup was performed, there were more fungal infections than in the other arm. In this study, patients were stratified by status of underlying disease, and the lower limit of the confidence interval of the difference in survival between the two strategies, among patients in first remission-induction therapy (the highest risk period), was exactly at the 8% predefined delta limit, thus leading the investigators to conclude that noninferiority was not demonstrated in this subgroup.112 Other studies compared the two strategies, with results that were consistently in favor of the diagnostic-driven approach.113\n",

Finally, it had been demonstrated that a mold-active prophylaxis might lead to a reduction in the sensitivity and specificity of the galactomannan test and therefore lowering its reliability.

Failure of mold-active prophylaxis is suspected when a patient develops signs and symptoms suggestive of a fungal infection without microbiologic documentation (e.g., a lung infiltrate unlikely caused by bacterial superinfection, with negative galactomannan, or the appearance of liver/spleen nodules) while receiving posaconazole or voriconazole prophylaxis. Four possible explanations include (1) the patient was not taking prophylaxis (lack of compliance); (2) the drug was not absorbed (posaconazole) or metabolized too fast (voriconazole), as shown by inadequate blood levels; (3) the \u201cnew\u201d fungal infection is due to a non-Candida/non-Aspergillus fungus intrinsically resistant to azoles; (4) the \u201cnew\u201d fungal infection is due to an azole-resistant Candida or Aspergillus species. In the first two cases, adjusting dosages without changing therapy seems an adequate option, whereas in the third and fourth case, shifting to another family (caspofungin for Candida and lipid amphotericin B for Aspergillus) seems the only possible option.",

The suspicion that the catheter is actually involved should only be raised in case of septic shock, endocarditis, rapidly progressive bacterial infection, fever with concomitant signs of infection at the catheter site (including the subcutaneous tunnel), and fever developing concomitantly with catheter flushing. In addition to clinical criteria, there are some microbiologic criteria (time to blood culture turning positive, differential colony count between peripherally and catheter-drawn blood culture) that could be used. When a catheter-related infection is proven or suspected, the choice of the antibiotic regimen should be based on the epidemiology of CVC-related infections in every individual center and on the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic characteristics of the available antibiotics. As a general rule, an anti\u2013gram-positive drug should always be included in the initial regimen, although the choice should not necessarily be vancomycin, except for centers with a high rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococci. On the other hand, in centers where staphylococci with high MIC values for vancomycin have been isolated, daptomycin, or linezolid might be considered. Moreover, because gram-negative organisms are not infrequent in single-agent or polymicrobial CVC bacteremias, an anti\u2013gram-negative coverage is recommended in all cases. In contrast, the empirical inclusion of an antifungal drug seems not to be appropriate, considering a relatively low incidence of fungal infections in this clinical setting.

For example, viridans streptococci have been associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome in neutropenic patients with severe oral mucositis. If this is a likely possibility, penicillin in combination with a glycopeptide appears to be the most logical choice. If pneumonia is evident since the beginning of the febrile episode, a bacterial etiology should be suspected, and the same antibiotic regimen commonly used for febrile neutropenia in high-risk patients should be used, with obvious considerations if the risk of highly resistant pathogens is present. On the contrary, if pneumonia apparently occurs as a breakthrough infection in a patient already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, fungal etiology is more likely and antifungal therapy is logical, although a resistant bacterial pathogen, including Legionella or M. pneumoniae, is also a possibility. Interstitial pneumonia is relatively rare during neutropenia, but it does occur. In this case, CMV, influenza virus, P. jirovecii, and M. pneumoniae are the likely etiologies. The appropriate diagnostic measures should be implemented, and treatment should be tailored accordingly. In any case, it is important to remember that the observation of a cavitary lesion in a febrile and neutropenic patient with acute leukemia should raise the suspicion of a bacterial infection, especially in presence of positive blood cultures (e.g., S. aureus or gram-negative rods) (Fig. 310-4\n). Indeed, fungal lesions in neutropenic patients usually present with the typical halo sign or with nodular lesions and not with cavitary lesions that become apparent only after neutrophil recovery.114\n",
