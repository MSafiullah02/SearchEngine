            "text": "Astroviruses are small round viruses (27\u201330 nm) that cause enteric disease in several animal species, including humans (Matsui and Greenberg, 1996). Detection of astrovirus in most species is limited to electron microscopy (EM), and fluorescent antibody detection. Both of these methods are time intensive and vulnerable to differences in interpretation. EM suffers from low sensitivity and usually detects virus only during peak shed times. Additionally, EM may fail to detect the characteristic star-like surface projections if the sample is not processed correctly (Caul and Appleton, 1982). Fluorescent antibody tests may fail to recognize astroviruses of different serotypes (Matsui and Greenberg, 1996). Furthermore, virus isolation by cell culture is limited to bovine, feline, porcine, and human astroviruses (Lee and Kurtz, 1981, Woode et al., 1984, Harbour et al., 1987, Shimizu et al., 1990).",

Fig. 1\nshows a schematic of the astrovirus genome and the relative location of these primers within the genome. The astrovirus genome is a positive sense RNA virus, which contains 3 open reading frames, (ORF) 1a, 1b, and 2. ORF 1a codes for a serine protease as well as other unidentified non-structural proteins (Willcocks et al., 1999). ORF 1b codes for the highly conserved viral polymerase, and ORF 2 codes for the more variable viral capsid protein (Koci et al., 2000, Koonin and Dolja, 1993). Therefore, RT-PCR protocols were developed specific to regions within both ORF 1b and 2. This allows for the detection of TAstV isolates in commercial turkey flocks closely related to the PEMS-associated astrovirus using primers specific to the capsid gene, or detection of different astrovirus serotypes using polymerase specific primers.",

Primers MKPol10 (TGGCGGCGAACTCCTCAACA) and MKPol11 (AATAAGGTCTGCACAGGTCG), produce an 802 bp fragment overlapping the viral polymerase ORF (Fig. 1). Both primer sets were used in the RT-PCR detection of TAstV. Total RNA was isolated from the intestines of astrovirus inoculated and control specific pathogen free (SPF) turkey embryos, experimentally infected and sham infected turkey poult intestines, as well as the intestines and feces from commercial turkey flocks suffering from an enteric disease using the TRIzol\u00ae total RNA isolation reagent (Life Technologies\u2122, Rockville, MD). First strand cDNA was synthesized by incubating 1 \u03bcg of the extracted total RNA with 20 pmol of reverse primer (MKCAP8 or MKPOL10) in a 20 \u03bcl reaction containing 15 units of SuperScript Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies\u2122), and 20 pmol of dNTPs at 42\u00b0C for 60 min. An aliquot (2 \u03bcl) of the first strand product was used as template for amplification in a 50 \u03bcl reaction containing, 10 pmol of primers (MKCAP8 and MKCAP19, Fig. 2\nA or MKPOL10 and MKPOL11, Fig. 2B), 20 pmol of dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 1.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies\u2122). Amplification, performed in a Perkin\u2013Elmer 2400 DNA thermalcycler, involved an initial denaturing step at 94\u00b0C for 1 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 56\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 1.75 min, and finished with a final extension set at 72\u00b0C for 2.5 min. PCR products were electrophoresised in a 1.1% agarose gel in TAE buffer and visualized by ethidium bromide staining and ultra violet irradiation (Sambrook et al., 1989). The PCR products were purified by Qiaquick\u00ae PCR purification system (Qiagen\u00ae, Valencia, CA) and sequenced (Smith et al., 1986) (Applied Biosystems) to confirm amplification of the intended gene (data not shown).",

There are few published reports of astrovirus disease in turkeys (McNulty et al., 1980, Reynolds and Saif, 1986, Thouvenelle et al., 1995a, Thouvenelle et al., 1995b). However, this may be a function of the tools currently available for the diagnosis of astrovirus infections. The virus we have sequenced was isolated from turkey poults suffering from PEMS (Koci et al., 2000). PEMS has caused severe problems in turkey flocks throughout the southeastern United States (Barnes and Guy, 1997). Currently we have detected TAstV in PEMS affected commercial turkey flocks from several states within the Southeast. Additionally, we have detected TAstV in commercial turkey flocks throughout the United States that suffer from enteritis and mortality, but are currently not defined as \u2018PEMS-affected flocks\u2019. We are presently using these protocols to survey healthy and diseased turkey flocks to understand the distribution of astroviruses, its importance in poultry diseases, and its role in PEMS.",
