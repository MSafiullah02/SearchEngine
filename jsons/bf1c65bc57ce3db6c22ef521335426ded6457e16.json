Clinically, mice develop loss of tail tone and a partial to complete hind-limb paralysis. As a result of the clinical and histologic similarities between MHV-induced demyelination and the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS), the MHV system is considered a relevant model for studying the underlying immunopathologic mechanisms contributing to immune-mediated demyelinating diseases [51] . A variety of different mechanisms have been postulated to contribute to MHV-induced demyelination. Several studies suggest that MHV-induced demyelination involves immunopathologic responses against viral antigens expressed in infected tissues [30, 31, 37, 47] . Although virus-specific antibody is considered important in suppressing viral recrudescence [84, 85] , it may also have a role in promoting demyelination [48] . MHV infection of immunosuppressed or immunodeficient mice results in high titers of virus within the CNS and death but not robust demyelination [53, 105] . Adoptive transfer of MHV-immune splenocytes results in demyelination to the infected recipients, suggesting a role for immune cells in amplifying demyelination [30, 31] . Additional evidence for T cells in contributing to demyelination is provided by Wu et al. [105] who demonstrated that both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells are important in mediating myelin destruction. In support of this are studies derived from our laboratory demonstrating that adoptive transfer of MHV-specific CD4 + or CD8 + T cells to MHV-infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice results in demyelination [30, 31] . However, demyelination was more severe in recipients of CD4 + T cell compared to CD8 + T cell recipients, and this supports a more important role for CD4 + T cells in amplifying demyelination in this model. Indeed, we have demonstrated that MHV-infected CD4 \u2212/\u2212 mice displayed a significant reduction in the severity of demyelination compared to CD8 \u2212/\u2212 and immunocompetent wildtype mice, suggesting an important role for CD4 + T cells in amplifying the severity of white matter destruction [53] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 162, "end": 166, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 567, "end": 571, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 817, "end": 821, "text": "[30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 822, "end": 825, "text": "31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 826, "end": 829, "text": "37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 830, "end": 833, "text": "47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 928, "end": 932, "text": "[84,", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 933, "end": 936, "text": "85]", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 990, "end": 994, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1141, "end": 1145, "text": "[53,", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1146, "end": 1150, "text": "105]", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 1313, "end": 1317, "text": "[30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1318, "end": 1321, "text": "31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1414, "end": 1419, "text": "[105]", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 1708, "end": 1712, "text": "[30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1713, "end": 1716, "text": "31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2210, "end": 2214, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Viral Persistence and Immune-Mediated Demyelination"}, {"text": "While T cells are generally considered important in driving demyelination in mice persistently infected with MHV, the mechanisms by which these cells participate in disease may vary and depend upon various factors including the ability to secrete interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 [80, 81] .

For example, the non-ELR chemokine CXCL10 is a potent chemoattractant for activated T cells and NK cells and functions by binding to CXCR3 expressed on the surface of these cells [40, 83, 102, 106] .

Moreover, viral replication appears to be a necessary prerequisite for inducing chemokine expression, as infection of astrocytes with inactivated virus results in a muted chemokine expression profile. Additional analysis revealed that both infected and noninfected astrocytes are capable of secreting chemokines following instillation of virus into the brain, indicating that viral infection is not required for chemokine gene synthesis by target cells. These data indicate that a factor or factors (possibly type I interferons) derived from infected cells are capable of functioning in both an autocrine and paracrine manner and regulate chemokine gene expression in response to viral infection. Other cell types that may also secrete chemokines following MHV infection include resident microglia/inflammatory macrophages as well as neurons [52, 75] .

However, a series of recent studies clearly indicates that during induction of an autoimmune demyelinating disease, there exists the presence of cell types within the brain that clearly have characteristics of DCs [34, 65] . In addition, emerging evidence points to a previously unappreciated role for chemokines in activating and inducing the migration of differing populations of DCs in response to microbial infection of the CNS [22, 23] . These cells may be important in initiation and/or maintenance of disease by participating in the activation of T cells. Given the potential importance of this population of cells with regards to linking innate and adaptive immune responses following viral infection of the CNS, we investigated whether DC-like cells were present within the CNS in response to MHV infection. In brief, our findings clearly indicate that a DC-like population of cells is detectable within the CNS as early as day 2 p.i. with MHV [96] . The activation/maturation of these cells as well as the ability to accumulate within the draining cervical lymph node (CLN) appeared to be dictated by localized expression of CCL3 [96] . Moreover, the ability of cultured DCs to secrete cytokines associated with the development of a T H 1 response such as interleukin (IL)-12 was profoundly altered in the absence of CCL3 [96] .

Further, analysis of the severity of demyelination in experimental groups of mice indicated that anti-CCL5 treatment resulted in a significant (p<0.05) reduction in the severity of demyelination compared to control-treated mice.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 232, "end": 236, "text": "[52,", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 237, "end": 240, "text": "53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 682, "end": 686, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Chemokines and Chronic Viral-Induced Demyelination"}, {"text": "A picture is slowly evolving from our experiments designed to test the functional contributions of CXCL10 and CCL5 to chronic demyelination within MHV-infected mice. Antibody targeting of the T cell chemoattractant CXCL10 in MHV-infected mice selectively affects CD4 + T cell accumulation within the CNS accompanied by improved motor skills and a reduction in the severity of demyelination [59] . In contrast, CCL5 is capable of attracting both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells into the CNS. It is also important to emphasize that our data on CCL5 and CXCL10 inhibition with regards to T cell and macrophage trafficking are corollary and it is possible that alternative scenarios exist. For example, studies by Bergmann and colleagues suggest that during persistent MHV infection there is limited to no trafficking of T cells from the periphery into the CNS. Rather, upon entry during acute encephalomyelitis a certain percentage of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells is retained and participate in disease [62, 93] . In this instance, CXCL10 expression would not be functioning as a T cell chemoattractant but rather to influence specific biologic functions of T cells as well as potentiating the retention of T cells within the CNS. In support of this, it is possible that CXCL10 serves to enhance CD4 + T cell proliferation, as several recent studies indicate that CXCL10 is important in contributing to T cell proliferation [18, 71, 101] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 390, "end": 394, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 987, "end": 991, "text": "[62,", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 992, "end": 995, "text": "93]", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 1408, "end": 1412, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1413, "end": 1416, "text": "71,", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 1417, "end": 1421, "text": "101]", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Chemokines and Chronic Viral-Induced Demyelination"}, {"text": "It is unlikely that CXCL10 contributes to T cell survival, as CXCL10 \u2212/\u2212 mice do not display any abnormalities with regards to T cell half-life nor do we see any increase in numbers of apoptotic T cells following anti-CXCL10 treatment. In addition, Narumi et al. [71] speculate that CXCL10 actually serves to retain CXCR3 + T cells within tissues and this influences disease severity. Therefore, the selective reduction in CD4 + T cells within the CNS of MHV-infected mice may not be the result of impaired trafficking.

Lane, unpublished observations). CCL5 signaling also modulates cytokine production by T cells following antigenic challenge. In support of this is our demonstration that inhibition of CCL5 signaling results in enhanced IFN-\u03b3 expression by virus-specific T cells, supporting the idea that CCL5 expression serves to regulate a T H 1-like state in T cells [32] .

An overview of the potential functional role for select chemokines in linking innate and adaptive immune responses in response to viral infection of the CNS is provided in Fig. 1 . In brief, following MHV infection there is robust expression of chemokines by infected astrocytes including CCL3 that contribute to the maturation/activation of local DCs, which ultimately enables migration to draining cervical lymph nodes. Activated DCs present antigen to T cells as well as secrete chemokines such as CCL3 and CXCL10 that enhance polarization to a T H 1 response. In turn, MHV-specific T cells express chemokine receptors including CXCR3 and CCR5 that enable them to traffic into the CNS as a result of localized expression of ligands CXCL9 and CXCL10 (ligands for CXCR3) as well as CCL5 (ligand for CCR5). In addition, our contention is that expression of CCR2 by endothelial cells of the BBB is also important in increasing the permeability of this structure.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 325, "end": 331, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Perspectives"}, {"text": "With regards to chronic disease, MHV persistence within the CNS results in chronic expression of CXCL10 and CCL5 which together contribute to the maintenance of a chronic inflammatory disease by attracting both T cells and macrophages (Fig. 2) . Local secretion of CXCL10 and CCL5 may also contribute to demyelination by enhancing specific T cell effector functions including (1) secretion of IFN-\u03b3 that activates local inflammatory macrophage and resident microglia, as well as directly damaging oligodendrocytes and (2) increasing CTL activity by CD8 + T cells. In addition, immature DC-like cells may also be susceptible to infection and secrete CCL3 (B) that functions in a paracrine and autocrine manner to bind to CCR1 expressed on immature DC-like cells. As a result of CCL3 signaling and MHV infection, the DC-like cells undergo maturation and activation (C) resulting in a remodulation of the plasma membrane characterized by decreased expression of CCR1 accompanied by increased expression of CCR7 as well as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II. CCR7-expressing, activated DCs home to the draining cervical lymph node (D). Upon entry, activated DCs express a variety of soluble factors including CCL3 and CXCL10 (E) that activate and enhance polarization of virus-specific T cells to a T H 1 phenotype (F). Activated T cells exit the lymph node via the efferent lymph (G), enter the blood stream, and migrate to the CNS via expression of the chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR5 (H) Fig. 2A -F Chemokines and MHV-induced demyelination. Persistent MHV infection within astrocytes leads to chronic CXCL10 and CCL5 expression (A) that serves to recruit CXCR3 + and CCR5 + T cells into the CNS (B). In addition, activated CD4 + T cells secrete CCL5 that enhances macrophage migration into the CNS (C). We believe that CXCL10 may also influence T cell effector functions within the CNS, including CTL activity (D) and IFN-\u03b3 secretion (E), leading to macrophage activation. Both IFN-\u03b3 production and CTL activity may enhance tissue destruction as well as macrophage activation that amplifies myelin destruction (F) Clearly, these observations indicate that chemokine signaling is an integral component involved in eliciting protective immunity in response to viral infection of the CNS. Conversely, our studies also indicate that chronic localized secretion of select chemokines ultimately amplifies disease severity through maintaining inflammation within the CNS. Importantly, studies derived from the MHV system demonstrate that antibody targeting of select chemokines offers a powerful approach towards delineating the functional contributions of these molecules in a model of immune-mediated demyelination.
