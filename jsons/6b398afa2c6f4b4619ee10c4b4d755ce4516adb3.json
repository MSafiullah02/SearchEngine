            "text": "Altruism and the medical profession have been linked throughout the history of medicine. Students are drawn to the calling of medicine because of altruistic values, dedication to service, and the desire to alleviate suffering and promote healing. Despite a dedication to these values, altruism in medicine is threatened by empathy erosion that develops in the clinical years of medical school and an increasing rate of medical student burnout. Currently, there are two widespread movements in medicine aimed at addressing the dual loss of altruism and physician and student burnout-professionalism and wellness. Despite widespread recognition of the problems and programs aimed at improving them, there has been little headway, and even calls to abandon altruism in the modern marketplace of medicine. What is needed is not an abandonment of a fundamental, defining value of the profession, but a reevaluation of the meaning of altruism in medicine and a framework that allows for students and physicians to provide altruistic care for a sustainable, rewarding career in the healing profession. This paper proposes the Enlightened Self-Interest in Altruism (ESIA) model as an ethical framework to allow medical students to synergize the interests of the self with those they serve in a mutually beneficial relationship to improve patient care and the healthcare system at large. The ESIA model acknowledges that egoism and altruism are intertwined, dynamic motivators of behavior. In the enlightened self-interest approach, the interests of the group are also the interests of the self. The physician-patient relationship is a dyad in which egoism and altruism may converge in an enlightened way that acknowledges that the interests of one are the interests of the whole. This is a paradigm shift from the historical view of egoism and altruism as opposing motivations. This paper will present the threats to altruism, explore the interface of egoism and altruism in a clinical vignette, and then present the ESIA framework as an educational approach to aligning the interests of providers and patients to prevent burnout and promote altruism.",

Altruism and the medical profession have been linked throughout the history of medicine (McGaghie et al. 2002; Feldman 2017) . While there are a myriad of reasons why students choose to matriculate in medical school, altruism and desires to alleviate suffering and promote healing are common features in the calling to medicine (Kutner and Brogan 1980; Gy\u0151rffy et al. 2016; McGaghie et al. 2002; Coulehan and Williams 2001; Feldman 2017) . Despite a dedication to these values, altruism in medicine is threatened by empathy erosion and burn out which are increasingly prevalent among medical students. Currently, there are two widespread movements in medicine aimed at addressing the dual loss of altruism and physician and student burnout-professionalism and wellness. Despite widespread recognition of the problems and programs aimed at improving them (Yasin et al. 2019) , there has been little headway, and even calls to abandon altruism in the modern marketplace of medicine.",

It alone does the work of charity in a Jovian and God-like way, dispensing with free hand truly Promethean gifts\" (Osler 1932, p. 282) . Altruism has been a defining feature of medicine throughout time. It is a core component of the ancient Hippocratic Oath (Feldman 2017) . The commitment to care for persons with infectious diseases despite personal risks was explained by understanding medicine as a moral enterprise, driven by the virtuous acts of providers (Zuger and Miles 1987) . These virtuous acts are not a historic past of plagues, but ongoing, as seen with the recent Ebola outbreak. Despite inadequate personal protections, healthcare workers (defined as doctors, nurses, and midwives) in Africa continued to provide care to infected persons, and the epidemic resulted in the deaths of hundreds of healthcare workers (Yakubu et al. 2016; Evans et al. 2015) .",

The Medical Schools Objective Project, sponsored by the Association of American Medical Colleges, states in bold text \"Physicians must be altruistic\" (Association of American Medical Colleges 1998, p. 4). The beginning of medical school has been considered to be a crossing of a threshold and a transition in one's social role in society defined by professionalism (Robins et al. 2002) . In the American Board of Internal Medicine's Project Professionalism, it states \"altruism is the essence of professionalism\" (Stobo et al. 1995, p. 5) . Medical school admissions committees seek out applicants who they believe will choose altruism as a guiding principle in their careers (Albanese et al. 2003) .",

It has been questioned whether altruism can even exist in the modern marketplace of medicine. In an editorial, Roger Jones describes \"a growing feeling that altruism in medicine, if not dying, is at least declining\" (Jones 2002, p. 624 ). Today's culture of medicine is considered to be \"hostile to altruism\" (Coulehan 2005, p. 892) . Some authors advocate for abandoning altruism in medical education as medicine is a compensated profession, and this financial compensation makes altruism an untenable goal (Burks and Kobus 2012; Glannon and Ross 2002) . Glannon and Ross (2002) argue that the most fundamental feature of the medical profession is not altruism, but a fiduciary responsibility to patients in which physicians have an obligation to act in a patient's best medical interest. They argue that altruism cannot exist in this context of a professional obligation. However, physicians have always received compensation for their services, and the concepts of professional obligation and financial compensation are insufficient to overthrow altruism as a defining feature, ideal, and inspiration in medicine.",

For patients, physician burnout results in lower quality of care, increased medical errors, and decreased patient satisfaction (Halbesleben and Rathert 2008; West et al. 2018) . Physicians with burnout are less likely to identify with medicine as a calling, thereby losing their passion for the art and practice of medicine (Jager et al. 2017) . For the healthcare system, physician burnout results in increased healthcare costs, decreased physician productivity, and decreased access to care as physicians leave the profession (Eckleberry-Hunt et al. 2009; West et al. 2018) . While the problem of physician burnout is widely recognized, uncertainty exists on how to address it. Studies have reported that interventions at the organizational and individual levels can be effective at decreasing burnout, but substantive overall improvement is considered unlikely until coordinated efforts at the national, state, leadership, and organizational levels are implemented (Shanafelt et al. 2017) .",

This may be ironic, but is it not predictable? Medical students are working in the same healthcare system that pulls providers away from the bedside to in front of a computer screen. They have less autonomy in the workplace, and they have long clinical hours after which they are studying for exams. They are shuffled from one rotation to the next without a constant peer group. All of these stressors are occurring as they enter a work environment characterized by human suffering and death. Over half of the attending physicians under whom they are training are themselves burned out, thereby limiting their cognitive and emotional energy to be teachers, role models, and mentors.",

But, this formal curriculum is subverted by the hidden curriculum in the clinical years. As medical training takes on an apprenticeship form, the culture of the environment becomes even more important. Medical students see attendings and residents use cynical and derogatory humor to ridicule patients with psychiatric disease, poor hygiene, substance use disorders, self-inflicted harm, obesity and other conditions, in what has been called the \"humor games\" in medicine (Wear et al. 2006) . Humor requires engaging with people with similar senses of humor, and is a form of cultural-insider knowledge that lures in medical students who are seeking a sense of belonging in the hospital culture (Wear et al. 2006) . Derogatory and disrespectful language is seen throughout the hospital and not just targeted at patients, but other providers and services, which is in stark contrast to the formal curricular values of respect, inclusivity, and cultural humility (Szauter et al. 2003) . The hidden curriculum also promotes emotional detachment in favor of a focus on factual knowledge. Specialization is glorified and it is implied that students who pursue primary specialties do so because they are not academically competitive enough to matriculate to a specialty training program (Mahood 2011) . Students have described a hierarchical and competitive atmosphere where teaching by humiliation is not uncommon in the clinical years (Lempp and Seale 2004) . Michael Fine describes the marketplace of medicine where sophisticated technologies rule in the clinical environment, leaching the profession of compassion (Fine 2018) . When students enter this de-personalized technology-driven market, their interests shift from serving others to doing good for themselves by pursuing lucrative subspecialties.",

The authors conclude that this instrumental helping, in which an individual helps another achieve a goal, is the earliest manifestation of human altruism and that children are predisposed to altruism (Warneken and Tomasello 2009 ). In this model, socialization then builds upon this predisposition for altruism, but is not the primary driving force.

Note that self-sacrifice is not part of this definition. Nor does this definition state that the self cannot also benefit, just that the ultimate goal must be the welfare of another-if there is concurrent benefit to the self, altruism is not necessarily nullified.

The resident, who is busy caring for a critically ill patient, states that he can't at the moment. The nurse looks somewhat irritated. Sara says, \"I'll see the patient.\" When Sara enters the room, she sees the patient writhing in pain. Sara performs a history and physical examination. She presents the case to one of the attending physicians who writes an order for pain medication based on Sara's report. Sara talks to the nurse about the order in order to expedite the process. When she goes back to check on the patient, she is relieved to see that the patient appears much more comfortable after the pain medication. The patient is very thankful. The nurse also thanks Sara. The attending physician was impressed by Sara's history and physical presentation and her ability to develop a differential diagnosis and treatment plan and gives her a good evaluation for the shift. That evening Sara gets home an hour later than expected because she had stayed late to care for the patient. When she walks into her apartment, she sees her roommate sitting on the couch and exclaims, \"Oh no! I completely forgot about our dinner plans.

When basic needs of the self are not met or are threatened, it compromises the ability to serve others. In striving for altruism, medical students must meet their personal needs to a sufficient degree to foster a sustainable career. The concept of egoism leading to altruism seems counter-intuitive and requires an educational framework to appropriately guide it, which I have termed Enlighted Self-Interest in Altruism (ESIA). ESIA is an educational framework for professional formation with the ultimate goal and reward of a fulfilling career, a state of being a part of something greater than oneself, and altruism. The concept of enlightened self-interest was first described by Alexis de Tocqueville as the principle of interest rightly understood in his 1835 book Democracy in America (de Tocqueville 2003) . Tocqueville reconciles the idea that every man's interests are focused on the self with acts of self-sacrifice with the concept that serving the community is in one's own self-interest-\"it serves as a truth that man serves himself in serving his fellow-creatures, and that his private interest is to do good\" (de Tocqueville 2003, p. 594) . He describes how \"man is brought home to himself by an irresistible force\" (2003, p. 594) . As attempts to stop the omnipotent force would be in vain, efforts should be not on stopping it, but directing it and applying it in such a way to allow man to be more virtuous. People can be motivated to sacrifice part of their time or property for the welfare of the group or community from which they benefit.",

Medical school is a self-actualization professional development in which students are learning to serve others by developing their own cognitive, emotional, and procedural skills. Tocqueville describes how enlightened self-interest does not result in great acts of self-sacrifice but rather in smaller, more regular, daily acts of self-sacrifice.

Self-interests in medicine that foster altruism include desires for intellectual development, respect and recognition of service, membership and belonging in professional and peer groups, physical and mental rest and recovery to allow for maximal job performance, non-career interests to allow a refreshed return to work, positive work environments, inspirational mentors, and responsive leadership (Fig. 1) . Individual students are motivated by different self-interests in varying degrees. ESIA guides and develops the self-interests that promote altruism to produce physicians that are advocates for patients as well as themselves, other providers, and the profession as a whole.

Students should be encouraged to think about how they can benefit from volunteering. When they arrive at the clinic, they should discuss their goals with faculty. After the experience, reflection on the experience may be encouraged by activities such as debriefing with the volunteer team, blogging about their experiences with an optional platform to share blogs with peers, or another creative outlet that encourages personal growth towards becoming a physician and experiencing the joy in serving others.",

The prevalence of burnout and empathy erosion in medical school demands a shift from the culture of self-sacrifice and self-flagellation. ESIA replaces the tension between self-interests and altruism with an alliance. Altruism is itself a self-interest in that it can be uplifting and promote a sense of purpose and well-being. ESIA promotes the intertwined relationship of self-interests and altruism to produce the desirable actions and behaviors in medical students. During a time when the relationship of medicine and altruism seems to be deteriorating, ESIA seeks to serve as bridge. ESIA makes altruism sustainable with the appropriate and guided incorporation of the self-interests.",
