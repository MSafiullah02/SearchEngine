Andersen et al. have recently summarized 31 potential candidates for COVID-19 in a highly accessible database of 120 experimental, investigational and approved agents [2]. Conceptually, BSAAs take advantage of the promiscuity of viral replicative mechanisms and host interactions to target two or more viral families [3]. Following the COVID-19 outbreak in December 2019, a few existing BSAAs have been rapidly introduced into clinical trials, spanning Phases II though IV. Umifenovir is a membrane fusion inhibitor targeting viral entry and lopinavir/ritonavir is a drug combination targeting viral protease, both approved for the indications of Influenza and HIV. They are currently being considered in different combinations in a Phase IV clinical trial for pneumonia associated with COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04255017) [4].",

Remdesivir has activity in preclinical studies against the species of coronaviridae implicated in SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) [6]. Notably, it has already been studied in a randomized, controlled trial for Ebola virus disease, demonstrating an antiviral effect [7]. Other Phase III agents being evaluated in combination therapy for viral pneumonia interestingly include the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine, based on promising in vitro data (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04261517) [8]. Chloroquine, in addition to its immunomodulating properties, has been shown to have antiviral activity at entry and post-entry stages of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. It can enhance the antiviral activity of remdesivir and potentially serve as a synergizer of BSAAs [9].",

One way to circumvent this issue is to evaluate two or more drugs acting on different cellular signaling pathways involving viral replication with minimal redundancy. Another strategy is high-throughput screening of compound libraries for synergistic combinations at the host\u2013virus interactome level for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, which may allow researchers to narrow down the spectrum of individual antimicrobials [3,12,13]. These strategies promise to address the often-weak activity of BSAAs by improving efficacy while potentiating dose reductions, reducing duration, cost of the drug development pipeline, lowering toxicity and minimizing emergence of secondary resistance.",

If one were to extrapolate the experience from precision oncology, where targeted cancer therapies and immunotherapeutics have made major gains against cancer, a broad-spectrum strategy will have fundamental flaws. Importantly, the lack of specificity of BSAAs may become implicated in the emergence of drug resistance and more virulent strains.",

As elegantly demonstrated by Ferron et al., the nsp14-ExoN of SARS-CoV forms part of a highly flexible complex with multienzymatic properties, likely facilitating compensated low fidelity of replication. What are viable strategies to circumvent this remarkable innate ability of coronaviridae to proofread their RNA and maintain genomic integrity, while allowing some degree of evolutionary freedom to mutate? Again high-throughput screening can come to the rescue here. Possibilities include compounds with affinity toward the nsp14-ExoN catalytic subunit or those with allosteric effects at critical sites with conserved residues causing conformational change of the entire viral RNA repair complex. Therefore, the hunt should now be on to identify an inhibitor of this viral nuclease.",

These discoveries are hoped to spur rapid efforts to develop vaccines and antibodies.
