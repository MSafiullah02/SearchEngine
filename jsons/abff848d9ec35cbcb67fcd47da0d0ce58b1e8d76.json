The objective of this study is to relate the situation of Covid-19 in African countries with those of the countries most affected by the pandemic. It also allows us to verify how, according to the observed situation, the African ecosystem seems to be much more resilient compared to that of other continents where the number of deaths is in the thousands. To verify this, the diagnosed morbidity and mortality reported for different states of the world are compared to the ages of life and the average annual temperature of these states. The results show that the less dramatic balance of the African continent compared to other continents is partly linked to the relatively high temperatures on the continent but also to the relatively young character of its population.",

However, pandemics are still part of our modern world, as we continue to have pandemics as devastating as HIV and as alarming as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Ebola and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Saqr and Wasson, 2020) . The Covid-19 epidemic with exponential curves reaching 3 million confirmed cases should not have come as a surprise. However, we seemed to ignore the past. (Peeri et al., 2020; Morse, 2007) . Unfortunately, Covid-19 is not the last pandemic in the world and we need to learn what we missed and how to avoid failures. today. While border closures and travel restrictions within countries may be helpful, this is much less effective than in the past. Pandemics require a stronger WHO with sufficient resources (Morse, 2007) . Failure to manage a pandemic in one country can have repercussions for the entire planet; therefore, pandemics require more solidarity and coordination so that fragile countries can find the resources to treat, isolate and combat severe epidemics. There are good signs that such efforts are being implemented (for example, the European Union has announced EUR 15 billion to combat the current pandemic in developing countries) and, hopefully, these efforts are being consolidated to become systemic, proactive and organized. In other words, pandemics require global efforts with a strong and resourceful World Health Organisation.",

Today, more than 3 million people are affected and the spread of Covid-19 continues to grow beyond the world's best performing health systems. However, it is clear that the geography of Covid-19 disease shows significant disparities between countries and age groups in terms of the level of disease and the extent of mortality. This differentiated prevalence prompts reflection on possible explanations by taking into account a set of endogenous and exogenous factors (geographical, environmental, biological, socio-cultural, political contexts, etc.) .",

The daily statistics emanating from the high infectious property of the new strain of coronavirus Covid-19, particularly its rapid worldwide transmission and the nature of the resulting deaths sweeping across countries, call for concerted efforts to limit local transmission in already colonized territories. There is currently no known consensual cure for COVID-19 infection and there is currently no evidence to recommend specific anti-Covid-19 treatment for patients confirmed to have this disease (WHO, 2020a).",

As of 13 April 2020, 1,850,527 confirmed cases of Covid-19-positive persons and 114,245 deaths worldwide had been reported to WHO (WHO, 2020c) . There was concern about the impact of this virus on African nations, given the weakness of prevailing health systems with suboptimal infrastructural support (WHO, 2020c). The recent mass exodus of health workers to Europe and the Americas and the continuing security threats of terrorism and violent crime make this new deadly viral threat a source of concern for governments in this subregion (Imaralu, 2020) .",

Indeed, these are the 30 countries in the world that have counted the most cases of Covid-19 as of Monday 13 April 2020. The objective of this study is to relate the situation of Covid-19 in African countries with those of the countries most affected by the pandemic. It also allows us to verify in what way the African ecosystem seems, according to the observed situation, much more resistant compared to that of other continents where the number of deaths is counted in thousands. To verify this state of affairs, two key hypotheses are raised: one natural (this is the average annual temperature of the country) and the other anthropogenic (this is the structure of the population). According to several scientists, the less dramatic balance of the African continent compared to other continents would be linked to the relatively high temperatures on the continent but also to the relatively young character of its population.

The first factorial axis (F1) of this representation is such that it determines the maximum inertia of the cloud and thus the variance. The second axis (F2) perpendicular to the first expresses the maximum remaining variance. The third axis, always perpendicular to the other two, is defined by the maximum remaining inertia; etc. Principal Component Analysis, or PCA, is a method of reducing the number of variables allowing the geometric representation of observations and variables. This reduction is only possible if the initial variables are not independent and have non-zero correlation coefficients (Bouroche and Saporta, 1980) . The method was applied to 60 countries (30 in Africa and 30 in other continents) and 6 variables which are: the Covid-19 situation on Monday 13 April 2020 (confirmed cases and reported deaths), the mean annual temperature and the structure of the proportion (0 to 14 years, 15 to 64 years and over 65 years).",

Since the first cases of Covid-19 infection detected in Africa in mid-February, as of 1 May 2020, there have been just over 26,663 reported cases (including those already cured) and 973 deaths in Africa, compared with over 3,175,207 cases of illness and 224,172 deaths worldwide (WHO, 2020d) . Statistically, many experts still point to the African anomaly and link it to climate, geography and, in the most extreme cases, even to a kind of biological resilience (Savana, 2020) . Africa, with 17 per cent of the world's population, is home to only 0.83 per cent of the world's sick and 0.7 per cent of its dead. Better still, with already more than 12,000 recoveries, it seems to be much more resistant than others to Covid-19. For the time being, in any case, no one denies that the spread of the virus seems to be singularly slow on the continent, and many reasons are cited to try to explain this (Marbot, 2020) .",

The hypothesis seems to be supported by the fact that the countries most affected by the pandemic have a rather temperate climate and that most cases are concentrated either in the extreme north of the continent or in the extreme south, where heat and drought are less overwhelming. On the research side, a British study confirms that, on average, fewer respiratory illnesses are found in hot and dry countries, and an American report of April 24 states that the half-life of the virus, i.e., the period required for its infectious power to be halved, may increase from 18 to 6 hours if heat and humidity increase (Marbot, 2020)00. Researchers nevertheless remain very cautious, like the director of international affairs at the Pasteur Institute, Pierre-Marie Girard, who stresses that during in vitro experiments it was found that the coronavirus \"multiplied very well in heat\". Sun, heat and humidity could weaken the Covid-19 virus. According to a study of the American government, presented Thursday April 23 in Washington, the virus responsible for the pandemic of Covid-19 weakens in a hot and humid atmosphere as well as under the rays of the sun. \"Our most striking observation to date is the powerful effect that sunlight seems to have in killing the virus, both on surfaces and in the air,\" said a senior Department of Homeland Security official Bill Bryan (2020). Despite this, Health Minister Olivier V\u00e9ran was sceptical and the WHO believes that high temperatures do not prevent the virus from being contracted.",

Doctors confirm that the majority of severe cases of Covid-19 involve people over 60 years of age, which would be fortunate for the continent, where the median age is 19.4 years and 60% of the population is under 25 years of age. It is also pointed out that one of the hardest hit countries, Italy, has 23.1 per cent of its population aged 65 and over, compared to 5 per cent in Africa. There is almost unanimous agreement on this hypothesis, but scientists qualify it by pointing out that although the African population is young, it is unfortunately more affected than others by diseases such as HIV or malnutrition, which can make it vulnerable. Finally, some researchers note that in Europe and the United States the elderly often live among themselves in old people's homes, which encourages the spread, whereas in Africa they more frequently live with their families.

Certain methods of detection, isolation of patients, and precautions during care developed previously are duplicable in the face of the coronavirus. The authorities also took the measure of the danger more quickly than others and put in place very early on the control or closure of borders, distancing or containment. This led Dr Moumouni Kinda, who has faced several crises with the non-governmental organization ALIMA, to say, \"Epidemics like Ebola have given us experience on communication and awareness, which are key points in breaking the chains of transmission of the virus.",

Without being overly optimistic, it must be said that solidarity sometimes seems to work better in Africa than in certain richer regions, where we see the major laboratories jealously watching over their discoveries in the hope of being able to market a treatment or a vaccine. Not to mention a Donald Trump trying to get his hands on the patents of drugs under development for the sole (financial) benefit of the United States...On a much more local scale, it is also pointed out that the community-based functioning of many African populations makes it possible to better convey prevention messages, but also to detect patients more quickly, since few people are likely to be left to their own devices.",

However, some doctors have noted some disturbing coincidences: there are reportedly fewer coronavirus contaminations in the countries most affected by malaria\" or tuberculosis. Or in those that massively vaccinate their population with BCG. Would contracting certain diseases be a barrier to Covid-19? It will take time to prove it, but many doctors believe that antimalarial treatments such as chloroquine have some effectiveness. That's partly why French Professor Didier Raoult and teams like the Drug Discovery and Development Centre (H3D) at the University of Cape Town are giving priority to testing antimalarial drugs. The WHO is critical, noting that some countries such as Burkina Faso, Nigeria and Senegal, where malaria is devastating, are not spared by the virus. More recently (20 April), the Malagasy President announced that his country was in possession of a \"vita malagasy\" remedy (made in Madagascar) with preventive and curative virtues against the coronavirus. Covid-Organics, the name given to this treatment, is an herbal tea made from dried artemisia leaves, produced by the Malagasy Institute for Applied Research (IMRA).

The Cameroonian professor Christian Happi, specialist in genomics, who divides his time between Harvard University and Nigeria, does not completely rule out this possibility: \"Africans are exposed to many diseases, so it is possible that their bodies react better. You'll have to look for antibodies to find out, but it's possible. After Ebola, we saw that many people in Nigeria had been exposed to the disease but had not developed it. \u00bb Another version of the virus: An idea that is similar to the previous one: since it now seems that several different strains of Covid-9 are present on the planet (up to eight distinct forms), perhaps the one present in Africa is less aggressive? This could also explain the fact that there seem to be more asymptomatic cases there than elsewhere. The hypothesis remains audacious insofar as the virus arrived through patients who contracted it elsewhere. Could it have mutated afterwards? The WHO does not rule out the idea, but stresses that in order to validate it it will be necessary to sequence the genome of Covid-19, which is currently underway.",

In the context of this SARS-COV-2 virus, transmission can take place during the last days of viral incubation, before symptoms appear or at least are significant. This is a viral strategy that has certainly allowed the virus to spread so impressively. Another risk of under-evaluating cases is the lack of diagnostic tests or one of the reagents that make them up.
