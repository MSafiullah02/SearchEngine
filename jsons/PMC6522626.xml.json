The decline in global neonatal mortality was less pronounced compared with the decline in global mortality in children < 5 years of age. In 2016, 2.6 million newborns died (slightly > 7000 per day on average) before turning 1 month old and accounted for 46% of all deaths in children < 5 years of age [1]. In the same year, the regions of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia accounted for 40% and 38% of global neonatal mortality. Notably, in South Asia, India accounted for 24% of global neonatal mortality. Infectious disease and neonatal complications are responsible for the majority of deaths [2, 3].",

Despite widespread pertussis primary immunization in childhood, the pathogen continues to circulate in the population and has even reemerged with increased incidence. The limited ability of vaccines to provide long-term immunity within vaccinated individuals is one of the reasons for this re-emergence [5]. Published data report that protection following vaccination wanes after 4\u201312 years. This situation can pose a significant public health issue as outbreak cycles occur every 3 to 5 years [6]. Importantly, the most vulnerable individuals to pertussis infection are unimmunized or incompletely immunized infants (< 6 months of age) [7, 8]. Family members, especially mothers, have been implicated as important sources of pertussis transmission in unprotected infants who are at high risk for complication and death [9].",

However, due to the limited data on neonatal disease burden and the lack of a well-established disease surveillance system, pertussis is not considered an important public health issue, especially by local healthcare professionals (HCPs). The HCPs seldom suspect pertussis because of the non-specificity of symptoms, lack of awareness and non-availability of diagnostic facilities. Together, these factors contribute to gross under-reporting, which leads to an under-representation of the true disease burden [10, 11]. Data on the neonatal pertussis disease burden across various South and Southeast Asian countries will guide HCPs in making informed decisions about pertussis vaccination to protect newborns. Therefore, the objective of our review was to collate and summarize information on the epidemiology and disease burden of neonatal pertussis in South and Southeast Asian countries (Fig. 1).",

Similar findings based on physical symptoms were documented in 2007 during a large pertussis outbreak in India with high rates of suspected pertussis in infants aged 0\u20131 year (71%; n = 39) [18]. In contrast, during 2011\u20132014, in Nepal, the incidence of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed pertussis was 13.3 cases per 1000 infant-years. This surveillance was conducted during a period of low pertussis transmission [20]. Notably, in another study from Nepal in which an influenza vaccine was administered in pregnancy, a low level of protection against pertussis was observed in young infants because of the low prevalence of maternal antibodies (detection of four pertussis antigens using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays) [19]. Elevated levels of maternal antibodies to pertussis antigens, suggestive of recent pertussis infection, were indeed only found in 4% of the total (n = 305) paired maternal-infant blood samples analyzed [19].",

We found a few studies providing some data on the neonatal pertussis disease burden in South and Southeast Asia (Table 2). Importantly, most of the data were obtained from hospital-based retrospective studies describing a series of pertussis cases that do not give actual incidence. Official statistics were difficult to obtain for most countries as mandatory pertussis surveillance systems based on active reporting are not well established in the region. Existing surveillance systems in the region rely on passive reporting where most cases are known to go unreported [26]. However, even in countries where disease reporting is mandatory, the pertussis burden may be underestimated. This is because the diagnosis of pertussis is challenging, especially in neonates, as other respiratory pathogens cause pertussis-like illnesses and the clinical presentation of pertussis varies. The situation is further complicated by the fact that case definitions for pertussis vary across countries [27] (refer to Table 3 for an overview of case definitions for the different age groups used for pertussis). Moreover, specific guidelines for the diagnosis of neonatal pertussis are not yet available, and existing recommendations are targeted at older children. In addition, most neonatal deaths occur outside the hospital environment; therefore, it is also difficult to ascertain and report the true causes of neonatal deaths.\n",

Factors such as the widespread availability of antibiotics and initiation of treatment prior to sample collection contribute to the increasing number of negative cultures and further hampers disease detection [7, 26].

            "text": "A resurgence in pertussis disease has led to a shift in primary pertussis prevention that has relied on infant immunization to protection by cocooning, i.e., vaccination of close contacts of newborn infants (new mothers, fathers, grandparents, siblings, caretakers, etc.), thereby reducing the risk of pertussis exposure for newborns. Cocooning programs, though effective, have had limited success and are not cost-effective [35]. Immunization of women during pregnancy rather than during the immediate postpartum period (the initial cocooning recommendation) is a better approach by directly providing protection through transplacental transfer of maternal vaccine-induced antibodies [35, 36]. Evidence from clinical trials and preliminary surveillance data suggests that maternal vaccination is well tolerated in pregnant women, fetuses and newborns and is effective in protecting the latter against pertussis [37\u201340]. While immunization during pregnancy offers several benefits, few studies have shown that maternally derived immunoglobulin G antibodies cause blunting of the infant antibody responses for the same or related antigens after primary vaccination [41, 42]. The clinical relevance of blunting is not apparent, and further investigation of blunting on pregnant women and infants is required [39].",

To reduce the pertussis burden in infants, the WHO considers maternal immunization to be a cost-effective strategy, in addition to cocooning, and recommends its use in countries with high pertussis morbidity and mortality in infants too young to be vaccinated [32]. In addition to the ACIP, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [55], the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [56] and national bodies such as the Indian Academy of Pediatrics [57] and the Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecological Societies of India [58] have also recommended the use of Tdap during each pregnancy. Despite national recommendations in several countries, in this region, uptake in pregnant women remains variable [26]. Multiple strategies to increase vaccine uptake should be considered to increase protection in infants, such as dissemination of information and education about the disease and the need for prevention in this vulnerable population [51, 59, 60]. A study reported that in Korea 95.1% of women surveyed received information from doctors about Tdap vaccination and that 81.2% of them were not aware of the need for vaccination. Most importantly, 89.6% considered the recommendation of obstetric doctors as the most influencing factor regarding their decision for Tdap vaccination [59]. This review intends to raise awareness among HCPs on the existence of neonatal pertussis in individual Asian countries and the need to improve Tdap vaccination coverage among pregnant women. Remarkably, obstetricians and gynecologists played a significant role in the elimination of maternal and neonatal tetanus in India [61, 62].",

Maternal immunization is a proven and cost-effective strategy to prevent pertussis in neonates when primary immunization starts at 6 or 8 weeks, as recommended by the WHO. Therefore, maternal vaccination should continue to be supported, while further research should fill knowledge gaps and a robust public health surveillance program for pertussis must be implemented to better understand the disease burden and to monitor the impact of the vaccine among infants and pregnant women.",
