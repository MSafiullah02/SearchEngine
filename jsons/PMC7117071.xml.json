Advances in the pathomechanisms involved in CARV infection has been made recently.\n3\nExcessive inflammation associated with severe infection can be controlled by blocking costimulatory signals, without altering immune-mediated virus clearance. Recent studies suggest that the activation of effector T cells in virus-infected lungs is generated by inflammatory cells locally. This modification of the immune response in the infected epithelium may lead to virus clearance and will regulate acute inflammation, and possibly immunological memory. Resolution of respiratory virus infection requires not only the elimination of the virus but also the repair and regeneration of normal lung structures and restoration of normal pulmonary function. Cells and molecules regulate processes such as epithelial cell to mesenchymal cell transitions, as well as the transformation of fibroblasts and fibrocytes into myofibroblasts. Dysregulation of these processes in response to lung inflammation is associated with progressive pulmonary injury and lung fibrosis.\n",
