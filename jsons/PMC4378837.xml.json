The pathophysiology of cholestasis in systemic disease can be a consequence of direct involvement of a disease process within the liver or extrahepatic biliary system or secondary to immune-mediated changes in bile flow (Table 1\n). Evaluating a patient with cholestasis for a systemic cause requires an understanding of the patient\u2019s risk factors, clinical setting (eg, hospitalized or immunosuppressed patient), clinical features, and pattern of laboratory abnormalities.",

Serum alkaline phosphatase levels 2 to 3 times the upper limit of normal are typical, whereas aminotransferase levels are either normal or only modestly increased. Apart from jaundice, symptoms such as pruritus and clinical signs such as hepatomegaly are uncommon. Treatment is supportive with fluid resuscitation and antibiotics.

Endotoxemia in rats has been shown to cause downregulation of bile uptake (Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide and organic anion-transporting polypeptide) and export (bile salt export pump and multidrug resistance protein 2) transporters for cholestasis,11 but a posttranscriptional mechanism is favored in studies involving human liver tissues.12 Nitric oxide and free radicals in the hepatic microvasculature can contribute to endothelial damage and the formation of fibrin microthrombi. Histologically, hepatocellular and canalicular bilirubinostasis predominates, often with nonspecific portal-based inflammation and Kupffer cell hyperplasia.13\n",

A high index of suspicion in the appropriate setting is crucial to expedite treatment. In the appropriate clinical context, fungal pathogens can disseminate to the liver and lead to varying degrees of cholestasis. Immunocompromised patients with hepatic candidiasis can present with suppurative granulomas, neutrophilic inflammation, and edema surrounding bile ducts.30 High fever and an increased serum alkaline phosphatase level are typical features. Infection with the yeast Cryptococcus neoformans can present with several hepatic manifestations, including jaundice caused by cholangitis. Bucuvalas and colleagues31 described a 15-year-old girl with right upper quadrant pain and jaundice in whom cryptococci were cultured from the bile duct. Tissue staining with India ink highlights the capsule, but detection of serum cryptococcal antigen is now the diagnostic test of choice. A hepatitislike picture may develop in 40% to 60% of cases of disseminated coccidioidomycosis, which is endemic in the southwest United States and can affect immunocompetent hosts. Pulmonary infiltrates with a granulomatous hepatitis, in conjunction with a markedly increased serum alkaline phosphatase level, are a classic presentation.32 Histoplasmosis can spread from the lungs to the liver as well, generally in immunocompromised hosts. Cholestasis resulting from histoplasmosis typically occurs secondarily from development of hemophagocytic syndrome33 (see later discussion).",

In 1 retrospective series,43 liver biochemical test abnormalities were found in 204 of 837 (24.4%) patients with sarcoidosis, of whom 15.2% were believed to have hepatic sarcoidosis. Prevalence rates are highest among African American and Scandinavian persons between the ages of 20 and 40 years. Liver involvement in sarcoidosis is usually clinically silent. A few patients (4%\u20137%) experience symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain or signs such as hepatomegaly, jaundice, and portal hypertension. Abnormal liver biochemical test levels were identified in 58 of 100 patients who underwent a liver biopsy in 1 case series.44 The serum alkaline phosphatase level is disproportionately high. In addition, 75% of untreated patients with sarcoidosis have an increase in the serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level. The pathognomonic lesion is the noncaseating granuloma, which results from a helper T cell type 1 response to an as-yet-unidentified antigen. Pathologically, hepatic sarcoidosis can be indistinguishable from primary biliary cirrhosis or primary sclerosing cholangitis. Although granulomas can be seen within the hepatic lobule, the principal findings are in the portal tracts and include a variety of bile duct lesions, such as acute or chronic cholangitis,45 periductal fibrosis, and bile duct loss (Fig. 2\n).46 Presinusoidal portal hypertension can develop from scarring of portal venules. In general, treatment is not recommended in patients with asymptomatic hepatic disease but is advised when symptoms of portal hypertension or severe cholestasis are apparent. Although patients may improve symptomatically with glucocorticoids and ursodeoxycholic acid,47 structural changes to the bile ducts can progress to biliary cirrhosis, resulting in some cases in the need for liver transplantation.48\n",

Risk factors for developing GVHD include an HLA mismatch, gender mismatch, and high number of T cells transfused from the donor. Liver involvement typically follows skin and gastrointestinal involvement. When profound cholestasis develops, the prognosis is poor. A serum bilirubin level greater than 6.1 mg/dL establishes a diagnosis of severe GVHD.66 The pathophysiology is complex and likely involves a constellation of immune-mediated features, including cytokine activation, endothelial damage from conditioning regimens, and many antigen-presenting cells in target organs. Histologically, lymphocytes are seen infiltrating small bile ducts, and epithelial cells undergo apoptosis. Ursodeoxycholic acid is effective in preventing hepatic GVHD and is administered as prophylaxis for the first 80 days after hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.67 Immunosuppression is the foundation of therapy for GVHD.

In a retrospective cohort study of 661 patients from the Royal Cornwall Hospital in England who were referred over a 4-year to 5-year period to a jaundice hotline, 8 of the 661 (1.2%) were found to have a primary cardiac cause of cholestasis.74 The hyperbilirubinemia of heart failure is typically unconjugated, with a serum bilirubin level of less than 3 mg/dL, but it can be conjugated and associated with higher bilirubin levels. Jaundice may become worse with repeated episodes of heart failure, often in association with a cardiac index less than 1.5 L/min/m2. Pathologically, the low-flow state of heart failure and resulting reduced oxygen tension cause zone 3 hepatic necrosis and ischemic biliary changes with cholestasis from bile thrombi formation. Bilirubinostasis is also postulated to occur as a result of extrinsic compression from sinusoidal and hepatic venule dilatation. Ischemic hepatitis (shock liver), which can result from myocardial infarction, massive pulmonary embolus, arrhythmia, or cardiac tamponade, is a distinct entity characterized by increased serum aminotransferase levels of at least 20 times the upper limit of normal and a rapid return to normal. Similarly high serum lactate dehydrogenase levels are characteristic. Seeto and colleagues75 compared 31 patients with ischemic hepatitis with 31 patients with hypovolemic shock secondary to trauma and found an average total bilirubin level of 2.8 mg/dL in the ischemic hepatitis cohort compared with 0.8 mg/dL in the traumatic shock group.

Cholestasis in neonates is especially problematic and can progress to life-threatening liver dysfunction. The incidence of parenteral nutrition-associated liver complications has decreased in neonates over time.80 The duration of parenteral nutrition in infants correlates with the risk of developing more progressive cholestatic jaundice. After 10 days of parenteral nutrition, canalicular cholestasis was present in 84.2% of infants, and after 3 weeks, bile duct proliferation was found in 63.6% of infants.81 The pathogenesis of parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis is multifactorial. The neonatal liver is immature and unable to excrete bile salts at a normal rate, thereby leading to bile acid toxicity, particularly from the secondary bile acid lithocholate. Bacterial translocation across an underdeveloped or unused segment of intestine causes systemic endotoxemia and contributes to cholestasis in the context of altered postsurgical anatomy (eg, bypass, short bowel, absent ileocecal valve). Enteral intake stimulates bile flow as a result of cholecystokinin (CCK) release, and in the absence of CCK, gallbladder dysmotility occurs and can result in biliary sludge, gallstones, and even acalculous cholecystitis. Hepatic steatosis is a more common manifestation in adult patients on parenteral nutrition, but cholestasis from biliary sludge and gallstones is also encountered. Early resumption of oral intake is critical to preventing the development of parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis, as is cycling of the parenteral nutrition infusion to allow for normalization of insulin and counterregulatory hormone levels. Ursodeoxycholic acid is effective for the prevention of cholestasis in patients with short bowel syndrome on long-term parenteral nutrition.82\n",

In general, exclusion of drug-induced cholestasis, parenteral nutrition-induced cholestasis, and biliary obstruction is a useful first step in both inpatients and outpatients. Cholestasis in the intensive care unit should raise suspicion for sepsis syndrome, particularly in the pediatric patient population. Severe hypovolemic shock can cause ischemic cholangiopathy characterized by pronounced cholestasis. In adult inpatients with mild hyperbilirubinemia, a detailed cardiopulmonary physical examination and transthoracic echocardiography are useful to exclude heart failure; marked increase in serum aminotransferase levels accompanying jaundice suggests ischemic hepatitis. Cholestasis in immunocompromised patients should prompt a detailed clinical history for evidence of an infectious exposure. A comprehensive workup for infectious organisms should follow. Transplant recipients should be evaluated for PTLD; evaluation should include a serum lactate dehydrogenase level and an EBV viral load. Often, cross-sectional imaging with positron emission tomography and evaluation for obstructive lymphadenopathy with ultrasonography are warranted. Hepatic sarcoidosis is typically a histologic diagnosis, but chest imaging and a serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level are usually helpful. Striking cholestasis in the setting of weight loss and hepatosplenomegaly are highly suggestive of systemic malignancy with hepatic involvement, especially lymphoma, as well as amyloidosis. In either case, pursuing a tissue diagnosis is necessary, although liver tissue specifically is not essential. Cholestasis in the setting of a systemic autoimmune disease should prompt evaluation for a primary autoimmune cholestatic liver disease such as primary biliary cirrhosis or primary sclerosing cholangitis. An extrahepatic source of alkaline phosphatase should be excluded if the only evidence of cholestasis is an increased alkaline phosphatase level. Liver biopsy is usually definitive and the procedure of choice when the diagnosis remains uncertain after a comprehensive noninvasive evaluation. The evaluation of a patient with systemic cholestasis requires a meticulous approach, with treatment directed toward the underlying cause.",
