The surgeons in SC were to work alongside, and under the purview of the ED and ID physicians in assessing and screening suspect cases of COVID-19. This was done after a 'Just-In-Time training' refresher course by ED physicians. The surgical division (comprising of general surgery, orthopaedics, urology, ophthalmology, otorhinolaryngology, hand microsurgery and neurosurgery) and even the radiology and pathology department from the ambulatory medicine division sent a total of 52 doctors to SC within 3 days of activation. These doctors were rotated on a 10 day shift roster and thereafter, returned back to their departments without segregation nor any cooling off period due to manpower constraints. If one doctor fell sick, the entire team on shift was required to selfisolate at home for several days till the sick doctor tested negative for COVID-19.",

This helped tremendously in reducing fatigue and through solidarity, lifted the morale of all the surgical trainees. It was a demonstration of leadership by example at first hand. Surgeons older than 60 years were excused from being rotated through the SC due to evidence of higher risk of mortality after contracting the disease (5) .",

Instead, due to our ability to cut elective work at short notice, we were able to be the first responder to the crisis and were privileged to work sideby-side with our medical colleagues.
