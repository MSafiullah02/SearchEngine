In this chapter, we examine in detail how biosurveillance systems detect and characterize outbreaks. We introduce an important distinction between case detection and outbreak detection. We discuss outbreak characterization, which is the process by which investigators elucidate characteristics of an outbreak that are important for disease control (e.g., causative biological agent, source, and route of transmission). We break down and analyze biosurveillance in this manner so that it can be modeled more formally, which is a prerequisite to providing computer support. Table 3.1\nsummarizes the topics of this chapter and links them to examples in Chapter 2 and additional examples introduced in this chapter (marked by bold type). The table serves as both an outline and a summary of the chapter.",

It works as follows: A sick individual seeks medical attention or is brought to a clinician, who establishes a diagnosis. If the diagnosis is considered a notifiable disease1\n, the clinician reports it (for more information on notifiable diseases, see Chapter 5). If the sick individual is a person, the clinician reports the case to a state or local health department. If the sick individual is an animal, the clinician reports the case to a state department of agriculture (see Chapter 7). This mechanism of case detection played a role in the detection of every outbreak described in Chapter 2, with the exception of cryptosporidiosis.",

The interpretation of diagnostic data is a complex cognitive activity. The clinician first generates a differential diagnosis, which is a list of diseases that the patient could have given the information the clinician has thus far. The clinician then resolves the differential diagnosis by ruling in (confirming) or ruling out (excluding) these diseases by further questioning, observation, and testing. The clinician draws on a large set of facts (medical knowledge) about the effects of disease on people or animals to generate and resolve a differential diagnosis. Clinicians acquire this knowledge during professional training and from textbooks of medicine (human or veterinary) and medical journals. The clinician also draws on available information about local disease prevalence, which may come to her attention through health alerts, morbidity and mortality reports, informal collegial consultations, and hospital surveillance information. In Chapter 13, we discuss how researchers have modeled clinical diagnosis mathematically and implemented these models in diagnostic expert systems.",

(Laboratories did not play a central role in the detection of outbreaks described in Chapter 2 because most of these outbreaks were caused by novel agents with no existing laboratory test.) The strength of laboratories as case detectors is that they are process oriented; therefore, they may report cases more reliably than can busy clinicians. A weakness is that there is not a definitive diagnostic test for every disease. A laboratory cannot detect a case unless a sick individual sees a clinician, who must suspect the disease and order a definitive test. Furthermore, not every individual for whom a test is ordered will comply and have the test done, and for some individuals with an illness, the test can be negative. Lag times for the completion of laboratory work can be substantial.",

If, however, the case data are diagnostically precise (e.g., the cases are confirmed diagnoses of FMD), one such animal in a data stream will stand out against the background level of zero. Figure 3.6\nillustrates this concept for SARS surveillance, showing that if the diagnostic data available support a more diagnostically precise case detection (i.e., SARS-like syndrome rather than respiratory syndrome), then subsequent analysis of the case data is expected to detect smaller clusters of disease against the background levels of individuals presenting with respiratory illness.",

A biosurveillance system must detect an outbreak as quickly as possible to enable treatment of those already sick and to prevent further illness. The required timeliness varies by biological agent and route of transmission. Early detection is usually expensive, so the exact relationship between morbidity and mortality and time of detection for each type of outbreak is important. An outbreak of anthrax due to aerosol release, for example, must be detected within days of release or, ideally, at the moment of release because many people will sicken and die within days of the release. Therefore, significant resources should be expended to accomplish detection as close to day zero as possible. In contrast, detection of some diseases, even those as virulent as smallpox, as late as weeks from the onset of symptoms in the first case is still within the window of opportunity to reduce considerably mortality and morbidity (Meltzer et al., 2001).",

Dr. John Snow, a London anesthe-siologist and pioneer of the science of epidemiology, decided to test his hypothesis that cholera outbreaks were a result of contamination of the water supply, a view contrary to the medical beliefs of the time. He plotted the home address of people who died of cholera on a map of London; he also marked the location of neighborhood water pumps, which were the source of drinking water at the time. The striking cluster he found of cholera deaths centered on water pumps has become legendary. The concentration of cholera deaths around the Broad Street pump was twice the number of deaths in the rest of the city of London, with approximately 500 deaths in the neighborhood in 10 days.

They can ask and answer questions such as the following: If I were to map the people in a community who developed pneumonia in the past week by using their work addresses, would the cases cluster in particular hospitals? This type of analysis would be very useful in SARS surveillance as SARS caused many hospital-based outbreaks in 2003.

Unknown individuals then transferred the powder into envelops and deposited them in mailboxes in or around Trenton, New Jersey. Mail sorting machines in postal processing and distribution centers compressed the envelops, thus expressing spores, which were sufficiently light to float in the air. The air carried the spores into the lungs of individuals working in the processing centers. After an incubation period, some of these individuals developed the disease inhalational anthrax. Postal workers delivered the envelopes to the addressees, who opened them, allowing the spores to float into the air in buildings. The addressees and other occupants of the buildings inhaled spores, and some developed inhalational anthrax. The spores infected the skin of other individuals, who developed the disease cutaneous anthrax. Investigators believe that cross-contamination of bulk mail resulted in a case of inhalational anthrax in a woman in rural Connecticut (Griffith et al., 2003).

Molecular subtyping identified the isolate from the 94-year-old woman as matching the isolates from the other anthrax patients infected through mail. The investigators did not find matching isolates in the woman's home or in any of the places she regularly visited. They did learn by going through her garbage that she regularly tore her bulk mail in half before discarding. And they found that bulk mail that was processed and delivered by her local mail distribution center had been processed in another post office in the 24 hours after heavily contaminated letters. Evidence that at least some of that bulk mail was cross-contaminated came when matching isolates were found on her local bulk mail processing machines. Investigators believe this woman's advanced age, medical condition, and habit of ripping junk mail in half before discarding it contributed to infection from a very low level of contamination of the mail she received.

Outbreak detection and characterization depend on case detection. Outbreak detection is based on continuous analysis of human and animal data by people working in health departments, the animal healthcare system, and hospital infection control, as well as by astute citizens. Outbreak characterization is an intermittent process that is triggered by outbreak detection. It is the process by which investigators elucidate characteristics of an outbreak that are important for disease control (e.g., causative biological agent, source, and route of transmission). Characterization is based on intensive collection of additional data when an outbreak is suspected or confirmed. Outbreak characterization is the least automated process in biosurveillance at present, but the future role of automation is already recognized (e.g., a recent report from the National Defense University identifies integrated automated event characterization system based on epidemiological, biological, and chemical models and artificial intelligence as a key element in an advanced biosurveillance system (Thompson et al., 2005).",

When analyzing these data, people and, increasingly, computers, must bring enormous amounts of knowledge to bear. As in Chapter 1, the analytic processes can perhaps best be summarized by an analogy. The very best outbreak investigators have minds like the great Sherlock Holmes. They are capable of great leaps of insight that appear \u201celementary\u201d only in retrospect. They arrive at the scene of an outbreak, assimilate the information available from patients and other observers, collect clues, and generate hypotheses about the culprit (the biological agent) and his accomplices (food, water, mail). Their secret: exhaustive knowledge about the modus operandi of hundreds of biological agents produced by scientific studies of past outbreaks. The very best investigators use this knowledge in a way that the clues that they receive and the evidence they collect (e.g., symptoms, test results, and epidemiological patterns) ultimately lead them to the biological agent and its source. The deductive techniques they use are numerous, and the selection is dictated by the problem at hand.
