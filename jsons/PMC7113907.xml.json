At the time of writing the global coronavirus pandemic has resulted in a suspension of the annual conference. Nevertheless, the Association is keen to acknowledge leading work in the field of environmental and resource economics and continue this award.",

Together this panel evaluates all papers published by the journal over the previous calendar year. Following this advice, we are pleased to announce that the EAERE Award for the Best Paper Published in Environmental and Resource Economics During 2019 goes to:Luis Mois\u00e9s Pe\u00f1a-L\u00e9vano, Farzad Taheripour and Wallace E.

Their paper addresses a context in which climate change threatens to negatively affect crop productivity in many regions across the world. Add to this inelastic demand for most agricultural products then a climate or otherwise driven shock in food supply can result in food price increases, limiting the ability of some regions to provide adequate food supplies for population needs. Such circumstances undermine calls for reductions of deforestation and reforestation despite these being recognized as efficient and effective approaches for mitigating climate change.",

(2) What is the mitigation cost incorporating FCS? (3) What are the impacts of FCS on food security? (4) What are the consequences for the global economy and food production when crop productivity is affected by climate change? (5) What is the economic value of reducing crop yield losses?",

            "text": "The authors modify a well-known computable general equilibrium (CGE) model (GTAP-BIO-FCS) to evaluate the economic and land use impacts of emissions reduction targets and policies under alternative climate scenarios. They find that implementing an aggressive FCS incentive can cause substantial increases in food prices due to land competition between forest and crop production. In fact, when climate-induced yield shocks are integrated in the analysis, food price increases are so large that it becomes clear that such an approach could not be adopted in the real world. Moreover, the results cry out for investment in agricultural research on climate adaptation, as the authors find that economic well-being falls more without mitigation, than with 50% emission reductions.",
