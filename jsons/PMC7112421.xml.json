In many cases the extracellular regions are heavily glycosilated in the process of synthesis, which is required for proper protein folding and function. Therefore, the production of biologically functional glycoproteins requires of an expression system that assures a correct glycosylation. Structural studies of glycoproteins must be then carried with glycosylated sample proteins.",

This problem can be reduced by decreasing both glycan complexity and heterogeneity. The preparation of glycoproteins suited for crystallization can be achieved by the use of expression cell lines with restricted glycosylation pattern, as the mutant CHO (chinese hamster ovary) Lec 3.2.8.1 (CHO-Lec) [1], [2], [3]. In this cellular line glycosylation pattern is simplified in high-mannose chains, composed by two N-acetylglucosamines and five mannose residues, which can be fully eliminated by treatment with the endoglycosidase-H enzyme (endo-H). This enzyme hydrolyzes the chemical bond between the N-acetylglycosamines residues located next to Asn of the glycoprotein, leaving only one residue attached to the glycoprotein. Once the CHO-Lec cell line is stably transfected, cells clones can be selected with good levels of native protein secretion to the cellular medium [4]. However, the glycoprotein of interest represents a low percentage of the total proteins in the cell supernatant and has low concentration, so that its purification requires of a highly specific and efficient initial step.",

About 95% of the protein was retained in the column, as revealed by a sandwich ELISA (not shown). The purity of protein in the elution fractions was tested by PAGE (Fig. 4A). Some protein impurities were detected, but a highly pure CoVSH1 protein was eluted in this first step of purification. Next, fractions were concentrated up to 3 ml and the glycoprotein digested with endo-H (Fig. 4B). The complete removal of the glycans by the enzyme probed it contained just high-mannose carbohydrates and that it was highly homogeneous. The molecular weight of the protein sample after the digestion was 70 kDa, similar to the expected value of 67 kDa. A second ion exchange purification step was sufficient to have a pure protein sample suitable for crystallization (Fig. 4C). The sample (5 mg) was concentrated up to 20 mg/ml for crystallization.",
