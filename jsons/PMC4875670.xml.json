Furthermore, strong associations of the polymorphic genotypes of DMEs with cases of pharyngeal and oral cavity cancer who were tobacco chewers or alcohol users demonstrate that gene-environment interactions may explain differences in genetic susceptibility for cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx [5].",

The treatment for this neoplasm is defined depending on the type of cell, degree of differentiation, location, extent, presence of lymph node metastases, and macroscopic characteristics with bone and muscle tumor involvement. Conventional methods used for treatment are surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapies, but all these methods are considered highly invasive. Surgery can cause irreversible aesthetic injuries with possible functional alterations [12]. However, some plants have been used in the treatment of cancer as alternative therapies in an attempt to soften the damage caused by conventional methods. The Euphorbia tirucalli (E. tirucalli), popularly known as aveloz, which is used in the herbal treatment of asthma, ulcers, warts and tumors in general has attracted scientific interest [13, 14].",

In addition, some authors have reported that a lectin isolated from the latex of E. tirucalli, called Eutirucallin showed biological activities such as neutrophils recruitment and cytokine production by macrophages [19]. An alternative that justifies its antitumorigenic potential is antimutagenicity. Substances with antimutagenic potentials increase the efficiency of repair mechanisms thereby acting as protective agents that decrease the frequency of DNA damage while controlling the disorderly proliferation of tumor cells [17].",

The annexin family consists of ubiquitous proteins that interact with phospholipids in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Each annexin consists of an N-terminal domain and a typical core domain. The annexin core is conserved among all members of the annexin family. In contrast, N-terminal domains are variable in length and are believed to regulate annexin functions, forming a truncated molecule with altered sensitivity to calcium [36].",

High ANXA1mRNA expression levels were observed in 90 % of CG cases and in 80 % of GA cases. However, LGALS1 mRNA levels were high in 60 % of the GA cases, while low expression was found in CG. These results have provided evidence that galectin-1 and mainly annexin-A1 are overexpressed in both gastritis and gastric cancer, suggesting a strong association of these proteins with chronic gastric inflammation and carcinogenesis [37].",
