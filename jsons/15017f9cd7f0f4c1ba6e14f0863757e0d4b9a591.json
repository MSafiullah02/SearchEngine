Previous studies have examined the association between ambient temperature and mortality or morbidity, however, there is little literature available on the ambient temperature effects on year of life lost (YLL). Thus, we aimed to quantify the YLL attributable to non-optimum ambient temperature. We obtained data from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2017 of 70 counties in Hunan, China. In order to combine the effects of each county, we used YLL rate as a health outcome indicator. The YLL rate was equal to the total YLL divided by the population of each county, and multiplied by 100,000. We estimated the associations between ambient temperature and YLL with a distributed lag non-linear model (DNLM) in a single county, and then pooled them in a multivariate meta-regression. The daily mean YLL rates were 22.62 y/(p\u00b7100,000), 10.14 y/(p\u00b7100,000) and 2.33 y/(p\u00b7100,000) within the study period for non-accidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory disease death. Ambient temperature was responsible for advancing a substantial fraction of YLL, with attributable fractions of 10.73% (4.36-17.09%) and 16.44% (9.09-23.79%) for non-accidental and cardiovascular disease death, respectively. However, the ambient temperature effect was not significantly for respiratory disease death, corresponding to 5.47% (\u22122.65-13.60%). Most of the YLL burden was caused by a cold temperature than the optimum temperature, with an overall estimate of 10.27% (4.52-16.03%) and 15.94% (8.82-23.05%) for non-accidental and cardiovascular disease death, respectively. Cold and heat temperature-related YLLs were higher in the elderly and females than the young and males. Extreme cold temperature had an effect on all age groups in different kinds of disease-caused death. This study highlights that general preventative measures could be important for moderate temperatures, whereas quick and effective measures should be provided for extreme temperatures.",

            "text": "At present, research on the association between ambient temperature and human health has mainly focused on the effects of extreme heat weather, and public health plans have implemented policies and interventions designed almost exclusively for heat wave [5, 6] . However, a cold spell risk is generally ignored compared with previous studies focusing on heat waves [7, 8] . Some studies have shown that the risk of extreme cold temperature was consistently higher than the risk of heat temperature on human health. Chen et al. [9] reported that 1.14% and 0.63% of non-accidental total mortality was attributable to extreme cold and extreme heat temperatures, respectively. In UK regions, cold-related mortality accounts for more than one order of magnitude than heat-related mortality. Every year, approximately 33 and two deaths per 100,000 population in Australian cities are associated with cold and heat temperature, respectively [10] . Moreover, some studies have reported that the effect of days of extreme temperature was substantially less than that attributable to moderate temperature. A multi-country observational study demonstrated that 7.71% of mortality was attributable to non-optimum temperature in 384 locations within the study period between 1985 and 2012, where the extreme cold and heat temperatures were responsible for 0.86% of total mortality [11] . A previous study showed that a moderately cold temperature was associated with a higher attributable risk (6.3%, 1.1 to 11.1) than extremely cold temperatures, moderately heat temperatures, and extremely heat temperatures, each of which were less than 0.6% [12] . One study even suggested that the preventive efforts were the same for warm and cold days and heat and cold waves [13] . Thus, more studies should be extended to take account of the whole range of effects associated with ambient temperature. Some studies have been published concerning the impact of daily ambient temperature on mortality or morbidity [14, 15] . However, those approaches failed to consider the differences in age, resulting in incomplete analysis of information. One approach to avoid the drawback is to consider year of life lost (YLL) as the outcome indicator instead of mortality. YLL, an important part of disability adjusted life years, is a measure of disease burden that uses the life expectancy. Compared with the traditional measure of mortality, YLL gives more weight to deaths among younger people [16] . YLL has been regarded as a more novel and precise indicator to evaluate the burden of disease and is used to identify and prioritize causes of premature deaths [17, 18] . To date, the ambient temperature-related YLL has only been studied by a few investigators, and the effects among different cause-specific death and socioeconomic status are also less clear.",

The daily YLL was calculated by summing the YLL for all death that occurred on the same day. We stratified the daily YLL by death causes, gender, and age (0-64, 65+ years). The value of YLL for each research location was related to the local population. In order to combine the effects of each district and county, we used YLL rate as health outcome indicator. The YLL rate is equal to the total YLL divided by the population of each district, and multiplied by 100,000. The unit of YLL rate is y/(p\u00b7100,000).",

In order to quantitatively estimate the overall effect of ambient temperature on YLL in the 70 counties, we calculated the attributable fraction. The total attributable YLL rate caused by non-optimum temperature is given by the sum of the contributions from all the days of the series, and its ratio with the total YLL rate provides the total attributable fraction. The components attributable to cold and heat temperatures were computed by summing the subsets corresponding to days with temperature below or above the minimum mortality temperature (MMT), respectively. MMT is derived by the lowest point of the overall cumulative exposure-response curve, and it is interpreted as the optimal temperature characterized by the lowest risk of YLL rate. We also explored the YLL burden attributable to mild and extreme temperatures. Extreme heat and cold temperature were defined as the temperature above the 97.5th percentile and below the 2.5th percentile mean temperature.

Heat temperature had a significant impact on YLL due to cardiovascular disease death, with an attributable fraction of 0.50%. However, the effects of cold and heat temperature were not significantly in respiratory disease death. The attributable risk for cardiovascular disease death in our study was different with other studies. One study showed that attributable fraction to cold effect was from 2.67 to 8.55, and the attributable fraction to heat effect was from 0.16 to 2.29 due to cardiovascular disease in China [25] . Li et al. [26] reported that mild cold temperature contributed the largest fraction to YLL (16.31%). Various underlying mechanisms have been postulated to explain the increased YLL risk associated with high and low ambient temperature. Cardiovascular mortality has been shown to increase in the winter. Exposure to cold temperatures was associated with cardiovascular death by inducing increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures, platelet count and serum low density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration, and initiating a mild inflammatory reaction [27, 28] . In addition, the main underlying mechanism for heat temperature related YLL is that stress on the cardiovascular systems increases during periods of high ambient temperature, especially among elderly people with limited adaptive responses. In elderly people, the ability to thermoregulate body temperatures is reduced [29] .",

This difference was mainly caused by the high minimum-mortality percentile, with most of the mean daily temperatures lower than the optimum value. Lately, one study has also found that the lower temperatures could lead to an increase of the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases, whereas, higher temperatures could lead to a decrease of the cumulative number of cases [30] . Thus, from the public health perspective, the government should pay more attention to cold weather to reduce life lost. Our finding showed that moderate cold temperatures and extreme cold temperatures had a significant impact on YLL due to non-accidental disease, with the attributable fraction of 9.26% and 1.02%, respectively. The extreme heat temperatures had a significant impact on YLL due to non-accidental disease, with the attributable fraction of 0.23%. However, the moderate heat temperatures had no significant impact on YLL due to non-accidental disease. Overall, the most of YLL were caused by exposure to moderately heat and cold temperatures, and the contribution of extreme days was comparatively low. Our study suggested that public-health policies and adaptation measures should be extended and refocused to take into account of the whole range of effects associated with ambient temperature.",

The analysis of data from 70 locations provides evidence for ambient temperature related YLL in a wide range of populations with different genders and ages. Our results demonstrated that cold and heat temperatures had significant impacts on YLL for people aged up to 65 years. Moreover, people aged over 65 years were at higher YLL risk of both heat and cold temperatures than young group. Studies have shown that elderly people are the most vulnerable group to cold or heat temperatures [31, 32] . This may be caused by relatively poorer physiological adaptation and pre-existing chronic diseases among the elderly. We found that extreme cold temperatures had effect on all age groups due to different disease-cause mortality. With the increasing societal resources on preventive cares for the elderly, the protecting measures for the youth to combat the harmful effects of extreme cold temperatures should not be ignored. Our results also indicated that both cold and heat temperature-associated YLLs were higher in females than males. Differences in socioeconomic factors and ability to withstand cold and heat stress between genders, may lead to the increase of sensitivity of women [33] . These findings provide evidence on temperature-related YLL between different sociodemographic characteristics, which have significant meaning for environmental and public health policy making.",

There could be measurement error, due to missing data of the use of air conditioning and the effect of urban heat island. Furthermore, we did not control for the impact of air pollution. Fourthly, the data covers only five years. In the future, we will collect data with longer time and more regions for the research.",

The temperature-YLL relationship varied in different disease-cause mortality and sociodemographic factors. Moreover, extreme cold temperatures had an effect on all age groups in different disease-cause deaths. This study suggests that public health interventions are necessary to minimize the health consequences of non-optimum temperatures. General preventative measures, such as planting trees and installing air conditioners, should be done to minimize the health consequences of moderate temperatures. Whereas quick and effective measures should be provided for extreme temperatures, such as starting the emergency system and protecting outdoor workers.",
