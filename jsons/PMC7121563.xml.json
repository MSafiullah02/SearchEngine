Continuants are entities that persist through time and are further divided into independent and dependent continuants. Independent continuants are defined as bearers of qualities and include OBI material entities (e.g., instruments, organisms, cells, proteins). Dependent continuants are entities that are intrinsic to or borne by other entities. These include things like qualities (e.g., mass, shape), and roles (drug, placebo) that require an independent continuant to exist. Occurrents make up the second major branch of the BFO hierarchy and are defined as entities that unfold over time.

The terms captured in the IEDB to describe such experiments include the immunization procedure, ELISPOT assay, host, immunogen, antigen, antigen-presenting cells and effector cells. The first two of these correspond to different steps of the experiment, and are clearly processes as they occur over time. The others are objects playing specific roles. For example, the same type of protein can be the immunogen in the immunization protocol and the antigen in the ELISPOT assay. Similarly, the same type of cell type can play the role of an effector cell and antigen presenting cell. In other words, these are structurally the same objects playing different roles in different processes. Examples for distinct types of objects, on the other hand, are organisms, cells, or proteins. This is the primary breakdown of experimental terms in OBI: Experimental steps correspond to processes of which each is associated with certain roles or functions that can be played by certain types of objects.\n",

For example, a particular type of peptide can play the role of epitope, the role of immunogen and the role of antigen. Before restructuring, the same exact peptide would have been stored in the epitope table, the immunogen table and the antigen table, but is now only stored once in the object table and is referenced by its different roles.

In these cases, the peptides have a special relationship termed \u201cproxy for.\u201d A proxy for relationship indicates that the material is used in an experiment, observations are made, and conclusions are drawn on the material or class of materials that it is believed to represent.

Thus, this count of spots is proxy for the number of spot forming cells (SFC). These proxy for relations form a chain that can be traversed all the way back to the immune response. That is, the spot count is proxy for the SFC, which is proxy for the activation of T cells, which is proxy for the frequency of epitope specific T cells induced by the immunization protocol.

The immunized mouse is input for an organ harvesting protocol that produces mouse lymph nodes as output. Lymph cells are next generated as output from a cell isolation protocol. This yields a mixture of T cells and potential antigen presenting cells (APC) among other cell types. These protocols are labeled N/A for IEDB as they are not explicitly captured. In the next protocol (ELISPOT assay) a peptide that can be derived from the protein administered in the first protocol, is administered as the antigen, to the isolated cell mixture. APCs present bound peptide on their surface via MHC molecules. T cells specific for this peptide will bind to the peptide-MHC complex and become activated This results in the secretion of interferon \u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3). Next, labeled antibodies specific for IFN-\u03b3 are added and bind to IFN-\u03b3 bound to the plate via a capture antibody (not depicted) in the vicinity of these activated T cells. In the next step \u2013 Spot counting, the plate is scanned by an instrument and spots are counted where labeled antibodies have bound.
