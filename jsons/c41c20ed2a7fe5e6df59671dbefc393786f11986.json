These mice -carrying genes encoding the heavy and light chain human immunoglobulin repertoire -were sequentially immunized with 2-week intervals with trimeric spike protein ectodomains (S ecto ) of three human coronaviruses from the betacoronavirus genus in the following order: 1. HCoV-OC43-S ecto , 2. SARS-CoV-S ecto , 3. MERS-CoV-S ecto , 4. HCoV-OC43-S ecto , 5. SARS-CoV-S ecto , 6. MERS-CoV-S ecto . Four days after the last immunization, splenocytes and lymph node lymphocytes were harvested and hybridomas were generated. Antibodies in the cell supernatants were tested for ELISA-reactivity against SARS-S ecto , SARS-S1, SARS-S1 A and SARS2-S1. Of the 51 hybridoma supernatants that reacted with SARS-S ecto only, 23 reacted with SARS-S1 A , 22 with SARS-S1 but not SARS-S1 A , 6 with SARS-S ecto but not SARS-S1. Four of the 51 SARS-S ecto hybridoma supernatants reacted with SARS2-S1 (see column on the right). The table displays ELISA-signal intensities (OD 450nm values) of hybridoma supernatants for the different antigens.",

Binding kinetics of 47D11 to immobilized recombinant SARS-S ecto , SARS2-S ecto , SARS-S1 B and SARS2-S1 B was measured using biolayer interferometry at 25\u00b0C 2 . Kinetic binding assay was performed by loading 47D11 mAb at optimal concentration (42 nM) on anti-human Fc biosensor for 10 mins. Antigen association step was performed by incubating the sensor with a range of concentrations of the recombinant spike ectodomain (1600-800-400-200-100-50-25 nM) for 10 min, followed by a dissociation step in PBS for 60 min.

A) Human HEK-293T cells expressing human ACE2-GFP proteins (see Methods) were detached and fixed with 2% PFA, incubated with a fixed amount of human Fc-tagged S1 B domain of SARS-S or SARS2-S that was preincubated for 1h with mAb (mAbs 47D11, 35F4, 43C6, 7.7G6, in H2L2 format) at the indicated mAb:S1 B molar ratios, and analysed by flow cytometry using a Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibody targeting the human Fc tag. Cells are analysed for GFP expression (x-axis, GFP signal) and antibody binding (y-axis, Alexa 594 signal). Percentages of cells that scored negative, single positive, or double positive are shown in each quadrant. Binding controls include PBS-treated cells (mock), treatment of cells with SARS-S1 B and SARS2-S1 B in the absence of antibody, and cells treated with antibodies only. The experiment was performed twice, data from a representative experiment are shown. B) Graphical account for FACS sequential gating strategies. FACS gating was performed as previously described 2 . Cells were selected in FSC/SSC dot plot to remove debris, single cells were gated using the FSC-H/FSC-W dot plot. GFP+, Alexa 594+ cells were gated and compared with a control sample with no detectable fluorochrome expression. The ELISA-based receptor binding inhibition assay was performed as described previously with some adaptations 1 . Recombinant soluble human ACE2 was coated on NUNC Maxisorp plates (Thermo Scientific) at 4 o C overnight. Plates were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 and blocked with 5% protifar in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 at room temperature for 3 hours. Recombinant S ecto and S1 B of SARS-S or SARS2-S (300 ng) and serially diluted mAbs (mAbs 47D11, 35F4, 43C6, 7.7G6, in H2L2 format) were mixed for 1h at RT, added to the plate for 2 hour on ice, after which the plates were washed three times. Binding to ACE2 was detected using HRP-conjugated StrepMAb (IBA) that recognizes the C-terminal Streptag on the S ecto and S1 B proteins. The experiment was performed twice.
