Most used probes are rapidly released from membranes, leading to fl uorescence signal decay and loss of contrast. Here, water-soluble lipid-polymer probes are synthesized harboring hydrophilic or hydrophobic far-red emitting dyes, and exhibiting enhanced brightness. They effi ciently label Hepatitis C Virus pseudotyped particles (HCVpp), more stably and reproducibly than commercial probes, and a strong fl uorescence signal is observed with a high contrast. Labeling with such probes do not alter virion morphology, integrity, nor infectivity. Finally, it is shown by fl uorescence microscopy that these probes enable effi cient tracking of labeled HCVpp inside hepatocarcinoma cells used as model hepatocytes, in spite of their autofl uorescence up to 700 nm. These novel fl uorescent lipidpolymer probes should therefore enable a better characterization of early stages of infection of autofl uorescent cells by enveloped viruses.",

The chosen model is the hepatitis C virus (HCV, \u2248100 nm diameter), for which only few fl uorescent probes have been used to label its lipid envelope. Randall's group developed a strategy based on the use of a small lipophilic dye, DiD (1,1-dioctadecyl-3,3,3,3-tetramethyl-indodicarbocyanine). Its fl uorescence is greatly enhanced when spontaneously inserting into membranes. [ 2 ] However, due to its small size, it is susceptible of release from the viral envelope with time, thereby leading to fl uorescence signal dilution. Recently, P\u00e9cheur's group, developing strategies using octadecyl-Rhodamine B chloride (R 18 ), strengthened the observation that HCV enters hepatocytes by clathrin-dependent endocytosis and unraveled the mechanisms of action of two antiviral molecules. [ 3, 4 ] However, the fl uorescence signal of this molecular lipid probe is again rapidly diluted intracellularly, preventing the long-term tracking of labeled viral particles.",

Our aim was to bind several fl uorophores per chain to increase the brightness of the resulting probe, taking into account the solubility and the inherent self-quenching phenomenon. Polymer chains with/without a lipid end-group were labeled with either FluoProbes\u00ae647H (called \"A\") or an isophorone derivative (called \"B\"). B dye binding was carried out as previously described. [ 9 ] Much effort was devoted to achieve the optimal conditions for the synthesis and purifi cation of A-based polymer probes. The binding was performed in DMF, a solvent common to both polymer and dye (A was not soluble in chloroform). The binding reaction was monitored by SEC with a double refractometric/UV-vis detection, the bound dye appearing at a smaller elution volume (6.2 mL) than the free dye (8 mL) ( Figure 1 A) . The ratio between the two peaks enabled determination of the binding yield. The reaction was slow but could be accelerated by a supplementary equivalent of DIPEA after 3 h. No further improvement occurred after addition of a third equivalent after 1 d (Figure 1 B) . The kinetics reached a plateau with a 86% binding yield after 4 d ( Table 1 ). The difference between the binding yields of A onto lipid-or nonlipid-ended polymers (60% vs 86%, respectively), could be explained by a less favorable conformation of the chain in DMF due to the apolar character of the lipid end-group, rendering activated ester functions less accessible.",

Concerning \u03a6, it is generally expected to decrease when the local dye concentration increases, due to self-quenching. [ 13 ] This is indeed observed here, as the dye density along the polymer chain increases. [ 7 ] However, \u03a6 value of the bound dye still represents 66%-76% of the free dye one, refl ecting a positive infl uence of the carboxylate groups along the chain that favor an extended conformation of the polymer chain due to electrostatic repulsions, thereby limiting the occurrence of dimer formation (usually nonfl uorescent). Finally, a binding of 3 to 9 fl uorophores per chain provided in all cases water-soluble polymer probes with limited self-quenching. The brightness of the polymer probes was determined from their \u03b5 and \u03a6 values, and was found two to fi vefold higher than that of free fl uorophores.",

Two strategies were chosen ( Figure 2 A): (1) incorporation of the probes during the preparation process of liposomes, further mixed with micrometersized polystyrene particles in specifi c conditions leading to their reorganization onto the colloidal surface; (2) \"simple contact\" between preformed LipoParticles and probes. For both strategies, LipoParticles appeared as individualized and localized fl uorescent dots.

Yet, several stages of its interactions with host cells remain ill-defi ned, and most importantly, hepatocytes are autofl uorescent cells, which precludes the use of probes emitting in the visible range for observations by optical microscopy. [16] [17] [18] Labeling of a surrogate model of HCV, HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp), with our far-red lipidpolymer probes was more stable and reproducible than using a commercial probe (Figure 4 ) . As a direct consequence, a strong fl uorescence signal was observed with a very high contrast, enabling visualization of virions for several minutes without loss of contrast. A complementary immunofl uorescence assay confi rmed the specifi city of virion labeling, that is, observed particles consisted in fully enveloped virions containing a capsid. The only discriminating parameter was the presence of the lipid end-group in the polymer probe architecture Adv. Healthcare Mater. 2016, 5, 2032-2044 www.advhealthmat.de www.MaterialsViews.com www.advhealthmat.de www.MaterialsViews.com ( Figure 5 ). In addition, labeling with the polymer probes did not alter the morphology nor the integrity of pseudotyped virions (Figure 3 ) , and minimally affected their infectivity (Figure 6 A) . This strongly contrasts with the 200-fold loss of infectivity of HCV labeled with DiD, as observed by Randall and co-workers. [ 2 ] We confi rmed that our labeling strategy did not alter the biological properties of virions, since they appeared to be internalized by clathrin-dependent endocytosis, as previously reported (Figure 7 ) . [2] [3] [4] Recent labeling strategies were based upon the coupling of quantum dots (QD) to the chemically modifi ed surface of virions. [ 21, 22 ] Although QD are highly bright and although virions were shown to retain their infectivity, the cytotoxicity of QD per se was not evaluated, while they appear to be cytotoxic .

Another strategy based upon the metabolic labeling of enveloped virions by azido sugars during infection was successfully developed.

By comparison, our small size biocompatible polymer probes (<10 nm) appear as safe means to label virions. Using our far-red fl uorescent lipid-polymer probes, we could achieve an effi cient tracking of virions inside hepatocytic cells, with no optical contamination due to their autofl uorescence up to 700 nm (Figure 6 B and Figure 7 ) . Several cell types are autofl uorescent, which could lead to false-positive staining and erroneous conclusions. [ 25 ] ",
