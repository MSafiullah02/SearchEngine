Renal tubular transport defects or specific metabolic abnormalities result in excretion of significant quantities of amino acids or glucose in the urine. Although hereditary defects in renal tubular transport of most of these substances are uncommon, they are of major biologic importance. First, some of these membrane transport disorders (e.g., cystinuria, lysinuric protein intolerance, Hartnup disease) are associated with significant morbidity. Second, the study of these disorders has provided much insight into the physiology of renal tubular reclamation of amino acids and glucose and into the specific metabolic pathways that control their reabsorption and has been crucial in understanding the genetics of tubular transport systems.",

Special emphasis is given to classic cystinuria, lysinuric protein intolerance, Hartnup disease, iminoglycinuria, and dicarboxylic aminoaciduria, including molecular genetic aspects of these diseases. Not discussed in this chapter are overflow aminoaciduria and glycosuria, which occur when the filtered load of these solutes exceeds the transport capacity of the renal tubule. This tubular overload is characteristic of various inborn errors of amino acid metabolism and diabetes mellitus, which result in elevated plasma levels of amino acids and glucose, respectively. Fanconi syndrome, a proximal tubular disorder characterized by generalized aminoaciduria, and urinary hyperexcretion of glucose, bicarbonate, phosphate, and other solutes, is discussed in separate chapters.",

            "text": "Circulating free amino acids are derived from dietary protein that is hydrolyzed and absorbed in the intestine, from intracellular catabolism of peptides, and from de novo synthesis within cells. More than 99 % of the load of free amino acid filtered by the kidneys of humans and other mammals is reabsorbed in the renal tubule and returned to plasma [1] [2] [3] . Amino acid reabsorption occurs predominantly in the pars convoluta of the proximal tubule and, to a small extent, in the pars recta [1, 3] . Amino acids are reabsorbed primarily from tubular lumen by an active uphill transport across the luminal membrane [1] . In studies using renal brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMV) from various animals to explore amino acid transport across this membrane, the rate of accumulation by vesicles and the magnitude of the overshoot, which indicates active concentrative transport, was greatly augmented by an external Na + gradient across the vesicle membrane [1] . Hence, it is widely accepted that uptake of most amino acids at the brush-border surface occurs by Na + -amino acid cotransport driven by the electrochemical Na + gradient from tubular lumen to cell [1, 3] (Fig. 1 ). The energy maintaining the Na + gradient is established by the Na + -K + -ATPase, which is located at the basolateral membrane and translocates Na + out and K + into the cell. An additional driving force for amino acid transport across the luminal membrane is the H + gradient (luminal > intracellular) which has been shown to drive uptake of proline [4] and glycine [5] by BBMV. Finally, cationic acids and cystine are reabsorbed across the luminal membrane in exchange for recycled neutral amino acids [2, 6] (see section \"Molecular Structure of Amino Acid Transporters\"; Fig. 1 )",

Thus, under normal conditions, net transepithelial movement of amino acids occurs from the tubular lumen to the peritubular space. However, net transepithelial flux of amino acids is composed of amino acid transport in both directions, namely lumen ! interstitium and interstitium ! lumen [2, 7, 8] . Indeed, the basolateral membrane harbors active Na + -dependent and Na + -independent transport and exchange systems mediating amino acid uptake in the tubular cell (Fig. 1) , and diffusional backflux of amino acids from cell into the tubular lumen is a welldocumented phenomenon [2, 7] . Interstitium to lumen oriented backflux through paracellular pathways also occurs. The sum of these vectorial fluxes determines the direction and the rate of transepithelial amino acid transport. This notion may be of major importance in understanding renal tubular amino acid transport, particularly in disease states and during maturation [8] [9] [10] .",

The demonstration of multiple transport systems for the same amino acid becomes meaningful if the reduced concentrations of filtered amino acid presented to the proximal straight tubule are considered. Thus, in the case of glycine, for example, two Na + -dependent, active transport systems have been demonstrated along the luminal membrane of the isolated perfused proximal tubule [11] : a low-affinity, high-capacity system in the convoluted segment and a highaffinity, low-capacity system in the straight segment. The latter system absorbs less glycine against a greater concentration gradient and probably permits the reduction of the luminal glycine concentration to lower levels than could be achieved in the proximal convoluted tubule [7, 11] . This axial heterogeneity of Na + -linked amino acid uptake systems with respect to kinetic characteristics has been demonstrated for several amino acids in BBMV derived from pars convoluta and pars recta of the proximal tubule [1] . The recognition of several transport systems for the same amino acid as well as their axial heterogeneity is of major importance in understanding the pathophysiology of hereditary aminoaciduria.",

These include systems for dibasic (cationic) amino acids, cystine, acidic (anionic) amino acids, neutral \u03b1-amino acids, imino acids, glycine, as well as \u03b2and \u03b3-amino acids. Ample evidence has accumulated that in addition to separate systems for L-cystine and the dibasic amino acids (L-lysine, L-arginine, and L-ornithine), these amino acids share a common transport pathway [17] [18] [19] , as also suggested by the urinary hyperexcretion of all four amino acids in classic cystinuria (see section \"Classic Cystinuria\").",

Most of these transport systems also have been identified in the kidney [2, 6, 21, 22, 24, 26] . These systems include the Na + -dependent, concentrative B 0 system (for most neutral amino acids), A and ASC systems (for small neutral amino acids), and N system (for glutamine, asparagine, and histidine), the Na + -and H + -dependent X \u00c0 AG system (for acidic amino acids), the Na + -and Cl \u00c0 -dependent Imino system (for proline and hydroxyproline), Gly system (for glycine and alanine), and \u03b2 system (for taurine, \u03b2-alanine, and \u03b3-amino butyric acid), the H + gradient-dependent PAT system (for imino acids and glycine), as well as the Na + -independent, nonconcentrative L system (for bulky neural, branched chain amino acids and cysteine), T system (for aromatic amino acids), b 0,+ system (for dibasic and neutral amino acids including cystine), y + system (for the dibasic amino acids lysine, arginine, and ornithine), and y + L system (for dibasic and neutral amino acids excluding cystine). Systems B 0 , X \u00c0 AG , Imino, Gly, \u03b2, PAT, and b 0,+ operate in the luminal membrane, whereas systems A, ASC, N, L, T, y + , and y + L operate in the basolateral membrane [2, 23, 24, 26] (Fig. 1) . The basolateral membrane-bound systems ASC, L, y + , and y + L as well as the luminal membrane-bound b 0,+ system function as antiport (exchange) systems [3, 24, 25] (Fig. 1 ). Recent progress in molecular cloning of amino acid transporters has helped to characterize, classify, and define the nature and the role of most of these tubular amino acid transport mechanisms at the cellular/molecular level (see section \"Molecular Structure of Amino Acid Transporters\").",

This renal adaptive response to diet is expressed at the tubular luminal membrane surface. It has been suggested [27, 30] that both new synthesis of transporter protein and shuttling of preformed transporters are required for expression of the adaptive response. An expression study in Xenopus oocytes [31] has demonstrated that the rat renal taurine transporter is regulated by dietary taurine at the level of both mRNA accumulation and protein synthesis. Reabsorption of glutamine in the proximal tubule plays an important role in renal acid-base handling. Metabolic acidosis strongly stimulates glutamine transport by the renal N system, which is needed for glutamate and ammonium production [2, 32] (see section \"The SLC38 Family\").",

Studies using MDCK cells, a cell line of distal tubular origin, demonstrate changes in taurine transport in response to changes in osmolarity of the medium [37] . It has EPT early proximal tubule (S1, S2 segments), LPT late proximal tubule (S3 segment), BBM brush border membrane, BLM basolateral membrane been shown that osmotic regulation of taurine transport depends on changes in taurine transporter gene expression [38] (see section \"The SLC6 Family\").

It has been shown that several serine/threonine protein kinases, including cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A: PKA), Ca 2+ -and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C, or PKC), and multifunctional Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK II) alter amino acid transport across the tubular brush-border membrane [41] [42] [43] .

EAAC1, a neuronal and epithelial high-affinity glutamate transporter, first cloned from rabbit small intestine [52] , was also identified in the kidney by Northern hybridization analysis [52] . In situ hybridization and immunofluorescence studies revealed that EAAC1 is expressed predominantly in the apical membrane in the S2 and S3 segments of the proximal tubule [57] . It mediates transport of glutamate and aspartate and is coupled to 3 Na + and 1 H + in exchange for 1 K + [51] . EAAC1, the prototype of the SLC1 family, is a protein of 524 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 57,000 Da and 10 hydrophobic, membrane-spanning domains. The kinetics and specificity of this protein when expressed in Xenopus oocytes were similar to those of the X \u00c0 AG transport system (see section \"Specificity of Transport\"; Fig. 1 ). The gene for human EAAC1 (SLC1A1) has been localized to chromosome 9p24 [58] . EAAC1 gene knock-out mice develop dicarboxylic aminoaciduria [59] .

Northern blot analysis [62, 63] revealed ubiquitous expression of these genes in several tissues, including expression in the kidney, consistent with the general metabolic role ascribed to system ASC. While ASCT1 accepts only small neutral amino acids, ASCT2 also transports L-glutamine and L-asparagine at high affinity. In one study [64] , ASCT2 has been reported to be expressed in the brush-border membrane of the proximal tubule.

            "text": "The SLC6 family is a diverse set of transporters comprising 20 members [67] [68] [69] . The SLC6 family is subdivided into four branches: the GABA transporter branch, the monoamino transporter branch, and the amino acid transporter branches I and II [67, 68] . The family includes, in the GABA transporter branch, the Na + -and Cl \u00c0 -dependent transporter for the neurotransmitter GABA (GAT; [70] ), and the osmolytes taurine (TAUT; [71, 72] ) and betaine (BGT; [73] ), operating in the brain and kidney [68, 69] , and in the amino acid transporter branch I, the neurotransmitters glycine (GLYT; [74] ) and proline (PROT; [75] ). The amino acid transporter branch II includes at least three members, B 0 AT1, XT2 (B 0 AT3), and IMINO (SIT1), which play an important role in amino acid transport in the kidney (see later). All these transporters show high homology in sequence and structure, and most of them have an absolute requirement for Na + and Cl \u00c0 . The proposed model of the SLC6 transporters is shown in Fig. 2 . The SLC6 family proteins have a 12 transmembrane domain (TM) topology and their structure is homologous with the bacterial leucine transporter LeuTAa ( [49, 50] ; Fig. 2 ). This structure is characterized by the 5 + 5 inverted repeat fold, which is composed of five transmembrane helices in the N-terminal half of the transporter that are repeated as a pseudo-twofold symmetry in the C terminal half of the transporter (Fig. 2) . This protein fold is shared by at least four other apparently non-sequence related families of transporters including SLC6, SLC7 and (for the first 11 TMs) SLC36 and SLC38 ( [49] ; see later). Studies investigating the crystal structure of the Na + -and Cl \u00c0 -dependent neurotransmitter transporters [50] and site-directed mutation analysis [76] have identified distinct domains which are similar between the family members and are important in Na + , Cl \u00c0 , and substrate coupling (Fig. 2) .",

The transporter has been further characterized by flux studies and electrophysiological techniques [86, 87] . B 0 AT1 has been shown to be the molecular correlate of the major apical neutral amino acid transport system B 0 (see section \"Specificity of Transport\"; Fig. 1 ; Table 1 ). It is a Na + -dependent but, unlike other SLC6 family members, Cl \u00c0 -independent transporter [86] .

SLC6A18 (B 0 AT3) is closely related to B 0 AT1 [3, 95] . It transports neutral amino acids but prefers glycine and alanine [96] . SLC6A18 knockout mice show hyperglycinuria as well as decreased glycine transport in BBMV derived from the kidney cortex of these mice [94] , suggesting a role for this transporter in renal glycine transport. B 0 AT3 appears to be the molecular correlate of the Gly system (see section \"Specificity of Transport\"; Fig. 1 ; Table 1 ). The involvement of SLC6A18 in hereditary iminoglycinuria or isolated glycinuria has been recently demonstrated [49, 97] (see section \"Iminoaciduria and Glycinuria\").",

In the kidney, B 0 AT1 and B 0 AT3 interact with Tmem27, and in the intestine, ACE2 interacts with B 0 AT1 [49] .

This structure, which is atypical of the known membrane transport proteins, raised the possibility that these proteins function as activators of transport systems y + L and b 0,+ or as regulatory subunits of these transporters. The genes for the human rBAT (SLC3A1) and 4F2hc (SLC3A2) were localized to chromosomes 2p21 [115, 116] and 11q12.3 [107] , respectively. In situ hybridization and immunolocalization studies have localized rBAT mRNA expression in the brush-border membrane of the proximal straight tubule (S3 segment) and the small intestinal mucosa [117, 118] . In contrast to rBAT, 4F2hc mRNA is almost ubiquitous with marked expression in kidney, where it localizes to the basolateral membrane of proximal tubular cells [24] . Studies from several laboratories have demonstrated that both rBAT and 4F2hc constitute heavy subunits of heteromeric amino acid transporters (HSHAT) [119] [120] [121] . These studies showed that rBAT (90 kDa) and 4F2hc (85 kDa) associated by disulfide bridges with a light subunit (40 kDa) forming a heterodimeric complex of 125 kDa ( [107, 121, 122] ; Fig. 3 ).",

            "text": "The light subunit of rBAT, termed b 0,+ AT, (SLC7A9), and the light subunit of 4F2hc, termed y + LAT-1 (SLC7A7), which were identified in 1998-1999 [123] [124] [125] , are members of the family of light subunits of the heteromeric amino acid transporters (LSHAT) [105, 106, 121, 122] . To date, seven members of the LSHAT family have been fully identified ( [49, 108] ; Table 2 ). Six SLC7 members (termed y + LAT1, y + LAT2, LAT1, LAT2, asc1, and xCT) heterodimerize with 4F2hc whereas only one (b o,+ AT) associates with rBAT ( [49, 108] ; Table 2 ). Research on the characteristics of LSHATs has revealed that they are unglycosylated proteins, which contain 12 putative transmembrane domains, a structure that is characterized by the so-called 5 + 5 inverted repeat fold ( Fig. 2 ; see earlier), they need coexpression with the corresponding heavy subunit to reach the plasma membrane, they confer the specific amino acid transport activity to the heteromeric complex and, finally, all the amino acid transport activities associated with the LSHATs behave as amino acid exchangers [44, 105, 108, 121, 122, [126] [127] [128] . In the kidney, the apical membrane-bound system b 0,+ (induced by rBAT and b 0,+ AT; Figs tertiary active exchange mechanism of tubular reabsorption of dibasic amino acids and cystine. This tertiary transport mechanism is linked to a high intracellular concentration of neutral amino acids ( Fig. 1) . System b 0,+ -mediated efflux of neutral amino acids from renal epithelial cells is the driving force for cystine and cationic amino acid reabsorption from lumen to cell [120, 129, 130] ( Fig. 1 ). Reabsorption of cystine and cationic amino acids is also favored by the intracellular negative membrane potential and by the reduction of cystine to cysteine ( Fig. 1 ) [120, 130] . The basolateral membrane-bound system y + L (induced by 4F2hc and y + LAT-1; Figs. 1 and 4) mediates an electroneutral exchange mechanism in which efflux of cationic amino acids (against the intracellular negative voltage) is enhanced by the influx of neutral amino acids in the presence of Na + ( Fig. 1 ) [120, 130] . The tissue distribution of rBAT/b 0,+ AT and 4F2hc/y + LAT-1 and their role in renal uptake of cystine and dibasic amino acids made them candidates for the defective genes in cystinuria and lysinuric protein intolerance, respectively (see section \"Cationic Aminoaciduria\"). The family of LSHATs includes, among others, the light subunits LAT-1(SLC7A5) and LAT-2 (SLC7A8) that combine with 4F2hc (SLC3A2) to form the L system (see section \"Specificity of Transport\"; Fig. 1 ; Tables 1 and 2 ). The 4F2hc/ LAT2 transporter is an obligatory exchanger found in the basolateral membrane of the intestine and the kidney proximal tubule [131] . The transporter has a broad substrate specificity including all neutral amino acids except proline [132] . A study using the proximal tubular cell line, OK, has demonstrated that 4F2hc/LAT2 mediates basolateral efflux of L-cysteine [133] . This finding suggests that this transporter may play an important role in exchanging intracellular cysteine for extracellular neutral amino acids thereby participating in the transepithelial flux of cysteine in the proximal tubule [2, 6] .",

Cystine/glutamate exchange mediated by this transporter plays an important role in controlling the intracellular level of glutathione which protects the cell against oxidative stress [137] .

Expression studies in Xenopus oocytes identified the ecotropic murine leukemia virus as the ubiquitous y + system (now called CAT1; SLC7A1), a Na +independent transport system that accepts dibasic amino acids and excludes cystine [139, 140] . In addition, it catalyzes transport of neutral amino acids only in the presence of Na + [24] (Fig. 1) . Northern hybridization analysis revealed the CAT1 gene in various mouse tissues including the kidney [139] . Since then, four other homologous murine cDNAs have been found to express a similar y + system amino acid transport activity, namely CAT2A, CAT2B, CAT3, and CAT4 (SLC7A2-4), which are not expressed in the kidney [24, 47, 138, 141] . The CAT transporters allow accumulation of cationic amino acids within the cell for general metabolic purposes. CAT-mediated arginine flux into cells plays a role in modulating nitric oxide synthesis in various cell types including kidney cells [108, 138, 141, 142] . The CAT1 cDNA predicts a 629 amino acid protein with 14 membrane-spanning domains and a molecular mass of 68,000 Da.",

It is a member of the SLC16 family of monocarboxylate transporters [144] . TAT1, which is a protein of 534 amino acids with 12 transmembrane domains, is expressed in the basolateral membrane of the proximal convoluted tubule [145] and functions as an electroneutral, Na + -and H + -independent facilitative diffusion (uniport) system mediating efflux of aromatic amino acids across the basolateral membrane [144] (Fig. 1) . Recent studies in Xenopus oocytes [146] and TAT1-defective mice [147] have provided evidence that TAT1 can also control neutral amino acid efflux via the neighboring exchanger 4F2hc-LAT2 by recycling the aromatic influx substrates of the exchanger.",

Both transport proline, glycine, alanine as well as GABA; however PAT1 has much lower affinity (high Km) for its substrates than does PAT2 [49, 151] . The PAT1 protein was found apically in small intestinal Caco-2 cells [154] and intracellularly in subapical membrane regions in proximal tubule cells [96] . PAT2, however, is expressed in the apical membrane of the S1 segment of the proximal tubule but not in the intestine [149] . PAT1 (SLC36 A1) appears to be the major shared imino acid/glycine carrier expressed in the brush-border membrane of the small intestine, whereas PAT2 corresponds to the H + gradientdriven proline [4] and glycine [5] transport demonstrated in renal BBMV [6, 44, 48] . The structure of PAT1 and 2 adopts the same 5 + 5 inverted repeat fold as SLC6 and SLC7 ( Fig. 2 ; see earlier). It is noteworthy that the H + gradient (luminal > intracellular) necessary for PAT1 and PAT2-mediated amino acid transport into the epithelial cell is likely generated by the activity of the Na + /H + exchanger operating in the luminal membrane [6, 148] . PAT2 (SLC36A2) has been shown to be the primary transporter mutated in iminoglycinuria (see section \"Iminoaciduria and Glycinuria\") [49, 97] .",

This alteration in ionic permeability and the increased luminal membrane Na + -H + antiport (coupled with a diminished Na + -K + -ATPase activity known to exist in the basolateral membrane of the neonatal proximal tubular epithelium [170] ) may result in a rapid dissipation of the electrochemical Na + gradient necessary for Na + -amino acid cotransport, thereby contributing to the aminoaciduria of early life [166, 169] .",

Lasley and Scriver studied infants affected with familial renal iminoglycinuria to explore the ontogeny of proline and glycine reabsorption in the renal tubule [172] . In iminoglycinuria the shared transport system for proline and glycine (possibly PAT2), which normally seems to be the dominant transporter for these amino acids in the proximal tubule of the newborn, is affected by mutation [97] (see section \"Iminoaciduria and Glycinuria\"). Using the occurrence of ontogeny and transport defect together, Scriver's group provided evidence for the appearance of the two specific high-affinity transport systems in succession, the proline transporter (possibly IMINO) by 3 months of age and the glycine transporter (possibly XT2) by 6 months of age [172] . Similarly, earlier studies on glycine and proline transport in rat renal cortical slices [8] showed that the specific high-affinity transporters were not present at birth yet appeared when amino acid reabsorption reached adult levels.",

Transport at the brush-border membrane occurs by a system shared by cystine and the dibasic amino acids, a system specific for cystine, and a system specific for dibasic amino acids. It is the shared highaffinity, low-K m system located in the S3 segment of the proximal tubule and identified as system b 0,+ (see section \"Specificity of Transport\"; Figs. 1 and 4), that is defective in classic cystinuria. The low-affinity, high-K m , unshared cystine system, and the low-affinity, unshared dibasic amino acid system, both located in the S1-S2 segments of the proximal tubule, have remained unidentified at the cellular/molecular level. The antiluminal membrane harbors two specific systems, one for dibasic amino acids identified as system y + L (see section \"Specificity of Transport\"; Figs. 1 and 4), and one for cystine, but no shared system. These transport mechanisms mediate uptake and efflux of these amino acids across the basolateral membrane. The brush-border membrane of the intestinal cell has a single highaffinity, low-K m , shared b 0,+ transport system for cystine and dibasic amino acids that is defective in classic cystinuria. Like kidney cells, intestinal cells have two basolateral membrane-bound, unshared specific transport systems, one (system y + L) for dibasic amino acids and one for cystine [2, 3] . The basolateral membrane-bound y + L transporter for dibasic amino acids in the kidney and the intestine is defective in lysinuric protein intolerance (see section \"Lysinuric Protein Intolerance\"). Amino acid transport in parenchymal cells and leukocytes from cystinuric patients is not impaired [2, 3] because the defect is not expressed in the plasma membrane of these cells.",

The excretion patterns of cystine and dibasic amino acids in heterozygotes have delineated the traditional classification into three cystinuric subtypes [188] . In type I, the most common phenotype, heterozygotes have normal urinary amino acid excretion. In type II, heterozygotes have high excretion of cystine and dibasic amino acids. Type III heterozygotes have excretion rates intermediate between the other two. The three subtypes were considered to be allelic, namely mild, moderate, and severe mutations at a single cystinuria gene locus [16] . However, Goodyer et al. [189] first provided evidence that type I and type III cystinuria mutations might involve two distinct genetic loci. This was demonstrated by the finding that type I/III compounds excreted less cystine than type I/I probands, although type III/N heterozygotes excrete higher levels of cystine than their type I/N counterparts. These findings could be explained by genetic complementation between nonallelic cystinuria genes. Subsequent genetic studies have supported this hypothesis (see later -Molecular Genetics) and have resulted in a revision of the above classification of cystinuria to type I (OMIM # 220100) and non-type I (OMIM # 600918) [173] (Table 3) . While type I cystinuria is inherited as a fully recessive trait with heterozygous parents unaffected, type II and type III (collectively now termed non-type I) subtypes lead to a variable degree of urinary hyperexcretion of dibasic amino acid in obligate heterozygotes and thus can be considered autosomal dominant diseases with incomplete penetrance [173] .",

Urinary excretion of these amino acids decreased steadily with age, to reach the variant parental value in heterozygous infants, but not in homozygotes.

Pras et al. [190] , using linkage analysis in 17 cystinuric families, demonstrated linkage between cystinuria and three genetic markers on chromosome 2p, providing strong evidence that SLC3A1 was indeed the gene causing the disease. Calonge et al. [191] identified six specific mutations in the SLC3A1 gene that segregated with a cystinuria phenotype thereby establishing the rBAT gene as the cystinuria gene (Fig. 4) . To date, a total of 133 different rBAT mutations have been reported in patients with type I cystinuria [173] . These mutations include nonsense, missense, splice site, frameshift mutations, as well as large deletions and chromosome rearrangements [173, 192] . An exhaustive mutation analysis on 164 probands of the International Cystinuria Consortium (ICC) identified 90.5 % of the affected alleles in type I cystinuria patients [192] . Defective transport of cystine and dibasic amino acids has been demonstrated for many of these mutations when expressed in Xenopus oocytes [120] . The most commonly occurring mutation is methionine 467 to threonine (M467T), which causes a defect in trafficking to the plasma membrane [193, 194] . This trafficking defect, which has also been demonstrated for other rBAT mutations [195, 196] , is consistent with the proposed role of rBAT as a chaperon of the corresponding light subunit in the heteromeric amino acid transporter [197] . To date, no SLC3A1 mutations have been found in non-type I patients [173, 192, 198] . A mouse model homozygous for the rBAT mutation D140G, which displays type I cystinuria with urolithiasis, has been reported [199] .",

            "text": "In 1997 Wartenfeld et al. [200] and Bisceglia et al. [201] demonstrated that cystinuria type III (and possibly also cystinuria type II) is linked to a locus on chromosome 19q13.1. Subsequently, the ICC [202] identified the gene SLC7A9 which encodes the 487 amino acid protein b 0,+ AT that belongs to the family of light subunits of amino acid transporters (see section \"Molecular Structure of Amino Acid Transporters\"; Tables 1  and 2 ). The gene localized to the non-type I cystinuria 19q locus. Cotransfection of b 0,+ AT and rBAT in COS cells resulted in trafficking of rBAT to the plasma membrane and induced L-arginine uptake by cells. SLC7A9 mutations were found in Spanish, Italian, North American, and Libyan-Jewish cystinuria patients [202, 203] . Mutation G105R is the most frequent SLC7A9 mutation in the ICC cohort of patients [106] . The mutation in Jews of Libyan origin is valine 170 to methionine (V170M), which leads to complete loss of b 0,+ AT amino acid uptake activity when cotransfected with rBAT in COS cells. To date, over 95 different b 0,+ AT mutations have been identified in non-type I cystinuria patients [173] . These mutations have explained 87.6 % of the alleles in non-type I cystinuria patients in the ICC study [192] . The unexplained alleles in non-type I (and type I) patients might be due to mutations outside the open reading frame of the SLC7A9 (and SLC3A1) genes (intronic or promoter regions), or due to mutations in unidentified genes [173] . Alternatively, partially inactivating (hypomorphic) SLC7A9 polymorphisms may contribute to the cystinuria phenotype [204, 205] . Two patients with I/III phenotype had a dual mutation in both SLC3A1 and SLC7A9, suggesting the existence of digenic form of the disease [192, 202] .",

These data, indicating the lack of a direct relationship between the mutated cystinuria gene and the type of cystinuria, have prompted the ICC to introduce an additional classification of cystinuria subtypes based on genotype rather than phenotype. This new classification includes: Type Adue to two mutations on SLC3A1 on chromosome 2; Type Bdue to two mutations on SLC7A9 on chromosome 19; and type AB with one mutation on each SLC3A1 and SLC7A9 (compound heterozygote) [173] .

The presence of typical flat hexagonal cystine crystals is diagnostic. Acidification of the urine precipitates cystine crystals and may improve the yield of the test. The best screening procedure is the cyanide-nitroprusside test [175] . A positive reaction occurs with as little as 75-125 mg cystine per gram of creatinine, which is well below that of homozygotes, who excrete at least 250 mg/g creatinine. Some heterozygotes may also be detected by this procedure [176] . The test is not specific and may detect acetone or homocystine as well. The definite test is a measurement of urine cystine and dibasic amino acid concentration by ion exchange chromatography. The upper limits of normal are 18, 130, 16, and 22 mg/g creatinine for cystine, lysine, arginine, and ornithine, respectively [176] . In establishing the diagnosis of classic cystinuria, it is important to exclude other conditions associated with increased urinary cystine excretion, including isolated cystinuria, tubular immaturity in young infants, generalized aminoaciduria (Fanconi syndrome), and organic acidemias [175, 176] .",

Clinical manifestations usually occur in the second and third decades of life, with a 62 % probability of stones by age 25 years [214] . Most patients have recurrent stone formation. However, not all patients with cystinuria-causing SLC3A1 and SLC7A9 mutations develop urinary calculi throughout their life and, in stone formers, substantial variability exists in the age of onset of the lithiasis [173, 215] . In addition to environmental factors such as dietary intake of fluid, salt and protein, the genetic background of the patient and unknown modifier genes are likely to contribute to stone formation [173, 215] Cystine stones are radiopaque because of the density of the sulfur molecule, and on a roentgenogram, they appear smooth. Occasionally, they form staghorn calculi. Cystine also may act as a nidus for calcium oxalate so that mixed stones may be found [216] . Factors contributing to mixed stone formation in cystinuria include alkalinization of urine and urinary tract infections.",

            "text": "\u2022 Increased oral fluid intake to increase urine volume and cystine solubility. Because cystinuric patients excrete 0.5-1 g cystine/ day, intake of 3-4 L could be required to keep the urinary cystine concentration below 300 mg/L. Patients should develop a 24-h schedule for drinking and voiding, with particular attention to nighttime hours, when urine may become supersaturated with cystine. Water should be taken at bedtime and whenever the patient awakens at night. Rigid adherence to fluid therapy is effective in approximately 70 % of patients [174, 175] . \u2022 Oral alkali in addition to high fluid intake to further increase cystine solubility in the urine [176] . A urine pH of 7.5 to 8 can be maintained by the provision of 1-2 mEq/kg per day of bicarbonate or citrate in divided doses. Because high sodium intake increases cystine excretion (see below), potassium citrate is preferred [176] . Because urine alkalinization may result in formation of mixed calciumcontaining stones, adherence to high fluid intake is crucial. \u2022 Dietary therapy to reduce cystine production and excretion. Studies examining the effect of dietary restriction of methionine (a metabolic precursor to cystine) on urine cystine excretion have yielded variable results [176] . Also, diets low in methionine (contained in animal proteins) are very difficult to follow and may be harmful to growing children. Therefore, dietary methionine restriction is not recommended [173, 176] . Urinary excretion of cystine and dibasic amino acids in cystinuric patients has been shown to correlate with urinary sodium excretion [219, 220] . Hence, dietary sodium restriction has been recommended as a safe approach to the treatment of cystinuria [173, 221] . L-Glutamine administered orally or intravenously in conjunction with low salt intake reduces cystine excretion [219, 222] , but this effect was not observed in patients receiving a normal salt diet [223] . The mechanism of the anticystinuric effect of glutamine is unclear. \u2022 Pharmacologic therapy to increase cystine solubility and decrease cystine excretion. Thesulfhydryl-binding compound D-penicillamine (\u03b2-dimethylcysteine) leads to the formation of the mixed disulfide penicillamine-cysteine following a disulfide exchange reaction. This mixed disulfide is far more water-soluble than cystine. Hence, penicillamine acts by reducing cystine excretion as well as by permitting the excretion of a more soluble compound. Penicillamine, given at a dosage of 1-2 g/24 h (30 mg/kg in children), is highly effective and reduces urinary cystine excretion to under 200 mg/g creatinine [224] . Unfortunately, penicillamine produces serious side effects in 50 % of patients [225] . These reactions include rashes (including pemphigus), fever, arthralgia, nephrotoxicity (including nephrotic syndrome in up to 30 % of patients, and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis), pancytopenia, and loss of taste. Penicillamine also increases copper and zinc excretion in the urine. The loss of taste may be reversed by copper administration [176] . Pyridoxine metabolism may be impaired, and pyridoxine supplementation should be provided for patients receiving D-penicillamine. Most of these side effects revert to normal upon discontinuation of the drug. Because of the serious side effects, D-penicillamine therapy should be reserved for patients unresponsive to conservative management, and stepwise dosing is recommended [174] . D-Acetyl penicillamine, another anticystinuric sulfhydryl agent, has fewer side effects than D-penicillamine. Mercaptopropionyl glycine (MPG), another agent undergoing a disulfide exchange reaction, is as effective as D-penicillamine in the treatment of cystinuria [226] . MPG has the same toxicity as D-penicillamine, but serious renal and hematologic reactions requiring cessation of therapy are much less common with MPG [226] . Because of the lower incidence of side effects and because this compound can be used in patients who develop allergic reactions to Dpenicillamine, MPG is the pharmacologic agent of choice in the therapy of cystinuria [226, 227] .",

This has been confirmed by a measurement of fluxes in jejunal biopsy specimens from LPI patients [241] as well as by the observation that infusion of citrulline to these patients results in massive argininuria and ornithinuria [242] . Citrulline is reabsorbed from the tubular lumen by a neutral amino acid transport mechanism and is converted to arginine and ornithine in the renal cell. Impaired exit at the antiluminal membrane results in backflux of accumulated arginine and ornithine at the brush-border membrane surface. It is the high-affinity, specific dibasic amino acid transporter y + L that is affected in this disease ( [243, 244] ; Fig. 1 ). Because basolateral membrane transporters of epithelial cells and plasma membrane transporters of parenchymal cells are homologous carriers, it is not surprising that granulocytes [245] , and cultured skin fibroblasts [246] from patients with LPI show impaired transport of dibasic amino acids. Erythrocytes from LPI patients, which do not have the y + L system, show normal cationic amino acid transport [247] .",

This gene encodes for 4F2hc, which has been shown to mediate y + L cationic amino acid transport in Xenopus oocytes [114] . Similar to rBAT, 4F2hc corresponds to the heavy subunit of a heteromeric amino acid transporter (HAT) [106, 250] (see section \"Molecular Structure of Amino Acid Transporters\"; Fig. 4 , Table 2 ). Subsequent molecular analyses however, have excluded the role of SLC3A2, which has been localized to chromosome 11q12.3, as the gene responsible for LPI [251] . Linkage studies in Finnish and non-Finnish LPI families have identified the genetic locus in chromosome 14q11-13 [252, 253] . y + LAT-1 (SLC7A7) is a member of the family of light subunits that combine with 4F2hc to form a heteromeric amino acid transporter (see section \"Molecular Structure of Amino Acid Transporters\" ; Fig. 4 , Table 2 ). The 4F2hc/y + LAT-1 heteromeric transporter mediates the activity of the amino acid transport system y + L that is responsible for the efflux of basic amino acids at the basolateral plasma membrane of epithelial cells [194] (see section \"Specificity of Transport\"; Table 2 ; Figs. 1 and 4) . The SLC7A7 gene localized to the LPI locus [123] . Subsequently, two groups [251, 254] have demonstrated that mutations in SLC7A7 cause LPI in Finnish, Italian, and Spanish patients. To date, approximately 50 SLC7A7 mutations, spread along the entire gene, have been found in LPI patients from different ethnic groups [244, 255] . Expression studies in Xenopus oocytes have shown that several LPI mutations result in proteins that fail to dimerize with 4F2hc and reach the plasma membrane [256] . Few mutants can reach the oocyte plasma membrane but fail to generate amino acid fluxes, indicating that these mutations inactivate the transport activity [256] . While 4F2hc (SLC3A2) is ubiquitously expressed, y + LAT1 (SLC7A7) is primarily expressed in tissues affected in LPI patients, including kidneys, small intestine, lung, and white blood cells [106, 123] .",

This suggests that, in addition to SLC7A7 mutations, hitherto unknown factors play a role in the pathogenesis of LPI [243] . The SLC7A7 knock-out mouse model [260] suffers from severe intrauterine growth retardation leading to neonatal death of most animals. The surviving mice have a metabolic dysfunction similarly to humans, if fed with a high protein content diet [260] . The therapy of LPI includes protein restriction to prevent hyperammonemia, as well as oral supplementation with lysine [261] , arginine, ornithine, and most importantly, citrulline [240, 262] . Administration of the latter amino acid, which corrects the hepatic deficiency in ornithine and arginine, results in clinical improvement and catch-up growth.",

            "text": "Hartnup disease, which may have afflicted Julius Caesar and his family [264] , was first recognized in two siblings in England in 1956 [265] . This disease is characterized by intestinal malabsorption and massive aminoaciduria of neutral monoamino monocarboxylic amino acids, namely alanine, serine, threonine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, histidine, glutamine, and asparagine [266, 267] . Most patients also have increased excretion of indolic compounds that originate in the gut from bacterial degradation of tryptophan [268] . Transport of other neutral amino acids including cystine, imino acids, glycine, and \u03b2-amino acids is normal. The disease is inherited as an autosomal-recessive trait and has an estimated incidence of 1:20,000 live births. Heterozygotes have normal urinary acid excretion under physiologic conditions. Clinical features in homozygotes may include photosensitive rash, cerebellar ataxia, and a variety of psychiatric manifestations mimicking pellagra [266, 267] . Pellagra-like manifestations are primarily caused by intestinal malabsorption and urinary loss of tryptophan, an amino acid which is required for niacin synthesis. The diagnosis should be suspected in any patient with pellagra who has no history of niacin or nicotinamide deficiency and is made by chromatographic analysis of urine [266] .",

Two lines of evidence supported the hypothesis that the defect was localized at the brush-border level [16] . First, plasma amino acid defects in patients with Hartnup disease are attenuated when patients are orally supplemented with free \u03b1-amino acids but not with corresponding dipeptides [270] . Dipeptides are reabsorbed by dipeptide-specific brushborder membrane transporters and hydrolyzed in the enterocyte; free amino acids can then exit the cell via a nondefective basolateral membranebound carrier. Secondly, tryptophan transport is normal in most parenchymal cell types obtained from patients with Hartnup disease, including leukocytes, placenta, and cultured skin fibroblasts [266, 271] . As indicated earlier, amino acid carriers in the plasma membranes of parenchymal cells are similar to the basolateral carriers of epithelial cells, which are normal in Hartnup disease.",

As suggested by Scriver et al.

This organic acid could be responsible for their neurological symptoms. Low-methionine diet resulted in significant clinical improvement.

The mode of inheritance of this disease is uncertain, but autosomal-recessive inheritance has been proposed [16] . Although the broad-specificity transporter of neutral amino acids is the major carrier for histidine, as suggested by in vitro studies as well as by fractional excretion rates above 50 % for this amino acid in Hartnup disease [16] , these case reports suggest the existence of an isolated histidine carrier that operates in the renal tubules and in the intestine.",

Lack of functional expression of the two selective transporters soon after birth also explains why infants with iminoglycinuria have fractional excretion fraction of glycine and proline approaching 100 % in the first months of life; these decline afterward [16] .

In addition or alternatively, hyperglycinuria could result from a defect in the shared, iminoacid-glycine transport system PAT2/SLC36A2 that compromises the affinity of the carrier for its substrate, rather than its capacity (K m variant) [49, 97] . This condition appears to be inherited as an autosomal-dominant trait. It is therefore also possible that these cases represent hyperglycinuric heterozygotes for the iminoglycinuria allele.

Studies on kidney slices [293] and isolated basolateral membrane vesicles [168] have localized the transport defect at the antiluminal membrane of the proximal tubular epithelium.

            "text": "Na + -glucose cotransporters belong to the SLC5 family of sodium cotransport proteins, also known as the sodium solute symporter (SSS) family, which includes more than 220 eukaryotic and prokaryotic homologues [305, 306] . Included in the SLC5 family are 12 human genes which encode for plasma membrane Na + -coupled cotransporters specific for solutes such as glucose, myo-inositol, and iodide [307] . This subgroup of cotransporters includes six Na + -glucose cotransporters (SGLTs), all of which are expressed in the kidney, among other organs [306, 307] . SGLT1 (SLC5A1), the prototype of SGLT cotransporters (Fig. 6) , is composed of 664 amino acids and has 14 membrane-spanning domains that are presumed to be \u03b1-helical, with the NH 2 and COOH termini facing the cytoplasmic side of the membrane [307, 310] . A simple glycosylation site is located in the hydrophilic domain between transmembrane segments 5 and 6 [311] . SGLT1 from rabbit [45] , rat [312] , pig [313] , and human [308] show high homology in sequence; in human, the gene maps to chromosome 22q11.2 [314] . Studies on Xenopus oocytes [315] have demonstrated that protein kinases (PKA and PKC) are essential to modulate SGLT1 activity by controlling its insertion or endocytic retrieval into or from the plasma membrane.",

[312] have provided evidence that the renal Na + -glucose cotransporter SGLT1 is the high-affinity/low-capacity transporter located predominantly in the straight proximal tubule (S3 segment); stoichiometry studies are consistent with a Na + to glucose coupling ratio of 2:1 [312] , while functional analyses of mutant proteins 200 300 400 showed that the COOH terminal domain, comprising the last five transmembrane \u03b1-helices, is involved in sugar binding and translocation [317, 318] . The SGLT1 (SLC5A1) gene has been implicated in hereditary glucose-galactose malabsoption. A second low-affinity Na + -glucose cotransporter termed SGLT2 (SLC5A2) was isolated from rat [319] and human [320, 321] kidney. The amino acid sequence of SGLT2 is 59 % identical to that of SGLT1 [320] . SGLT2 has a Na + glucose coupling ratio of 1:1, does not recognize galactose (which is a substrate for SGLT1), and is strongly expressed in proximal tubule early segments (S1 and S2) [321] . The human SGLT2 gene was mapped to chromosome 16p11.2 [322] . Clinical, physiological and molecular data indicate the SLC5A2 gene that encodes for SGLT2, is responsible for familial renal glycosuria (see section \"Hereditary Glycosuria\").",

To gain insights into the mechanisms of Na +sugar contransport, Faham et al. [330] have analyzed the crystal structure of the Vibrio parahaemolyticus sodium-galactose symporter (vSGLT), a bacterial homolog with 32 % amino acid identity with the human SGLT1 protein (hSGLT1), and refined it to 2.7 \u00c5 resolution. As shown in Fig. 7 , the structure comprising 14 transmembrane (TM) domains, has a core motif of inverted repeats of 5 TM helices, that strikingly resembles the leucine transporter LeuT, despite that their amino acid sequence is very different [331] . Galactose binds to the center of the core [330] ; molecular dynamic studies show that upon release of Na + into the cytoplasm the protein undergoes conformational change allowing the release of galactose into the cytoplasm [332] .",

GLUT2 (SLC2A2), a low-affinity transporter, is the predominant facilitative glucose transporter of hepatocytes, intestine and renal tubules [337, 338] . The structure is colored as a rainbow from the N terminus (red) to the C terminus (purple). The blue and red trapeziums represent the inverted topology of TM2 to TM6 and TM7 to TM11. The gray hexagon with red trim represents the galactose. Residues involved in sugar recognition, gate residues, and a proposed Na + site are shown in cyan, gray, and yellow circles. (b) Structure viewed in the membrane plane. The coloring scheme and numbering of \u03b1 helices is the same as in a. Bound galactose is shown as black and red spheres for the C and O atoms. The proposed Na + ion is colored as a blue sphere (Reprinted with permission from Ref. [330]) In the kidney, GLUT2 is present only in the basolateral membrane of tubular cells located in the S1 and S2 segments of the proximal convoluted tubule [337, 338] . Mutations in SLC2A2 cause Fanconi-Bickel syndrome. GLUT5 has also been identified in the kidney [340] . In summary, transepithelial glucose transport in the proximal tubule occurs by two different pairs of apical Na + -dependent and basolateral Na + -independent glucose transporters [294, 333] (Fig. 8) . A luminal Na + -dependent, low-affinity/highcapacity glucose transporter (SGLT2/SLC5A2) and a basolateral Na + -independent, low-affinity transporter (GLUT2/SLC2A2) are responsible for the bulk of glucose reabsorption in the early part of the proximal tubule. A luminal Na + -dependent, high-affinity/low-capacity transporter (SGLT1/ SLC5A1), coupled with a basolateral Na + -independent, high-affinity transporter (GLUT1/ SLC2A1), reabsorb the remaining glucose molecules in the late part of the proximal tubule.",

The general metabolism of carbohydrates as well as insulin secretion are normal. The condition exists from infancy throughout adult life, and diagnosis usually is done on routine urine analysis. The distinction between renal glycosuria and diabetes mellitus is made with a fasting blood glucose level and a glucose tolerance test. The disease is transmitted along an autosomal recessive mode, although glycosuria in some heterozygote carriers has led investigators to also postulate a dominant inheritance [353, 354] . Renal glycosuria is not associated with impaired D-glucose transport in the intestinal epithelium [298] . The underlying pathogenic mechanism appears to be an isolated, selective defect in proximal tubular glucose transport. The analysis of renal titration curves for glucose reabsorption reveals two types of renal glycosuria [296, 353] (Fig. 5) . In type A, or classic renal glycosuria, both minimal glucose threshold (F minG ) and maximum rate of glucose reabsorption (Tm G ) are reduced. In type B, the F minG is reduced, while Tm G is normal, although the splay is increased. It has been suggested that the type A mutation reflects reduction in the capacity of the glucose transport system, which might arise from a uniform defect in all nephrons, while type B reflects a decrease in the affinity of the transport system, which may also be a consequence of nephron heterogeneity [298, 355] . A third type of glycosuria, termed type O, was described by Oemar et al. [356] ; in this rare condition, tubular reabsorption of glucose is virtually absent, and all glucose filtered is excreted in the urine.",

Glucose-galactose malabsorption (OMIM# 182380) is an autosomal-recessive disease characterized by a neonatal onset lifethreatening watery requiring immediate withdrawal of glucose and galactose from the diet [353] . Studies of jejunal biopsy specimens have shown a defect in the intestinal Na + -dependent glucose transport [368] . In 1991, mutations in the intestinal brush-border SGLT1 Na + -glucose cotransporter were shown in two sisters with glucose-galactose malabsorption [369] , which made this condition the first disease found to be caused by a mutation in a membrane transport protein. To date, more than 40 mutations have been identified in patients with glucose-galactose malabsorption [307] . In most cases, these cause missorting of the protein to the cell surface [307, 353] . Patients with glucose-galactose malabsorption have a mild defect in renal tubular reabsorption of glucose, with normal T m for glucose but decreased minimal threshold (F minG ) [353, 368] . In contrast, patients with renal glycosuria have no intestinal defect in D-glucose absorption. This proves that the SGLT1 Na + -glucose cotransporter that is mutated in glucose-galactose malabsorption is shared between the intestine and the kidney, as previously suggested [312, 316] , while the glucose transporter impaired in glycosuria is not shared.",

Conversely, mutations in the high-affinity/lowcapacity 2Na + -1glucose cotransporter (SGLT1/ SLC5A1), which also transports galactose and mediates residual glucose reabsorption in the late proximal tubule cause glucose-galactose malabsorption and type B renal (mild) glycosuria.",

This autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by glycogen accumulation in the liver and in the kidneys, fasting hypoglycemia, impaired utilization of glucose and galactose, renal Fanconi syndrome, rickets and markedly stunted growth. Renal losses of glucose are due to impaired transport of monosaccharides across the renal basolateral membrane. Conceivably, this leads to glucose accumulation and cell toxicity, resulting in generalized proximal tubulopathy. More than 30 different SLC2A2 mutations have been described in patients with Fanconi-Bickel syndrome; the clinical phenotype can be very heterogeneous [377, 378] . Knock-out mice lacking GLUT2 gene exhibit extreme glycosuria [379] . Treatment is symptomatic and includes control of glucose homeostasis, treatment of rickets, replacement of renal solute losses, and promotion of growth [376] (see also \u25b6 Chap. 50, \"Renal Manifestations of Metabolic Disorders in Children\").",

In the past, the use of phlorizin for this purpose was limited because of its side effects, partial oral bioavailability, and lack of selectivity for SGLT2 [294, 370] . Over the past decade, SGLT2-specific inhibitors have been developed and are currently under investigation for the treatment of diabetic patients [380] [381] [382] [383] . These include compounds such as dapagliflozin, canagliflozin or YM543, among others. The potential advantages of these therapies include mitigation of hyperglycemia independently from insulin secretion, and induction of an osmotic diuresis, which can be beneficial in reducing glomerular hyperfiltration, body weight gain, and hypertension [380, 381, 384] . Recent studies, however, have reported serious side effects [380, 382, 373] , including volume contraction, malnutrition, and infections. Hence, more safety data are needed before these treatments can be introduced in human medicine.",
