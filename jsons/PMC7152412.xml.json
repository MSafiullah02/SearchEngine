In this context, the incentive to reduce HAIs is perhaps more on the ability to help decrease ICU and hospital length of stay and therefore improve access to the system. Infection prevention and control, patient safety, patient advocates, and health care providers alike see the value of improved health outcomes associated with reduction in nosocomial infections.",

Over time the epidemiologic roles of the susceptible host, the infected person, and the route of infection were more clearly elucidated and came to be known as the chain of infection. The interaction among these three components is dynamic, and infection may be favored when the host is more susceptible, the infectious agent is more virulent, and the route of transmission is more facilitating.",

In Canada and the United States, the procedures and practices that should be continuously practiced in health care settings are termed Standard Precautions and Routine Practices, respectively, and are briefly outlined in Table 97-1. The concept of Standard Precautions, in which the health care worker has a responsibility to practice certain behaviors (e.g., hand hygiene) or use certain interventions (e.g., wear a mask when face-to-face with a coughing patient) based on a recognition of the need to do so rather than because they were asked to do so, has not yet been universally adopted in health care settings.

The pretest likelihood of colonization, the cost of the test, the timeliness of test reporting, the ability to isolate screened patients, and the degree to which MRSA transmission is occurring are all factors that influence the feasibility and usability of the type of screening program chosen.26 Although increased frequency of screening will identify more colonized patients, it is not clear if this practice reduces the frequency of transmission in the PICU setting.27 An active MRSA surveillance testing program is recommended when MRSA transmission continues to occur despite the implementation of basic practices for prevention and monitoring of transmission.28\n",

During hospitalization, the normal endogenous flora of the nasopharynx are replaced within days by gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas spp., Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter, and Stenotrophomonas spp., and various Enterobacteraciae spp. S. aureus is also a cause of HAI lower respiratory tract infection.

Multiple variables associated with increased risk for SSI in various studies include intrinsic factors (e.g., age, glucose control, obesity/malnutrition, smoking, steroid use, prolonged preoperative hospital stay, preoperative nares colonization with S. aureus, perioperative transfusion and immunosuppressive medications, presurgical comorbidity) and extrinsic factors (e.g., preoperative antiseptic showering, preoperative hair removal, patient skin preparation in the operating room, preoperative hand/forearm antisepsis, management of infected or colonized surgical personnel, antimicrobial prophylaxis). In pediatric cardiac surgery patients, an open sternum is a risk factor for SSIs.96, 97 Operative risk factors are surgical scrub by the team, skin preparation of the patient, appropriate and timely antibiotic prophylaxis, surgical drapes and attire, surgeon skill and technique, asepsis, and operative time. Operating room characteristics are also considered extrinsic factors. They include ventilation, traffic, and sterilization of surgical equipment. Postoperative factors incorporate incision care and discharge planning.",
