Viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C, influenza, rotavirus, chikungunya, and dengue affect millions of people each year worldwide. The emergence of novel strains of H1N1 flu1 and previously unrecognized pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus2 and SFTS bunyavirus3, 4 has highlighted the threats of viral emergence and pandemic with which humanity regularly contends. This, along with the emergence of antiviral resistance among viruses such as influenza, highlights the need to better understand virus replication and the virus\u2013host interaction to identify critical restriction points that can be targets for antiviral drug development and vaccine generation.",

Studies of virus interaction with this pathway have also shown that the pathway is not simply a \u201cproviral\u201d kinase when activated, but that it also acts as part of the host response to viral infection. This suggests that PI3K/Akt signaling represents a two-faced player in interactions between the virus and cell, able to both promote viral replication and be an active part of the immune response that will eventually quash virus replication. This review will describe the different approaches that viruses have taken to dominate the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The viruses chosen in this review highlight the varied manner in which this pathway is manipulated and turned to the advantage of the invader, while also pointing out how the pathway also plays a role in host defense.",

Further, proliferating cells are more likely to activate retroviral gene expression to stimulate virus production. However, this may not be the only role for the PI3K/Akt pathway in the retrovirus life cycle, and more recent research into viruses, such as HIV, suggests that the virus may benefit from inducing Akt activity to prevent premature apoptosis.40\n",

As is true in most kinase cascades, the activity of Akt signaling can be decreased through phosphatase-mediated dephosphorylation of Akt activation domains. Conversely, kinase signaling can be potentiated by decreasing phosphatase activity. For PI3K/Akt signaling, the cellular phosphatase PP2A is at least partially responsible for the dephosphorylation and inactivation of Akt.41, 42 By decreasing the activity of PP2A, more Akt will remain in the active state. This approach to activating Akt signaling has been adopted by the genus Polyomaviridae. Simian virus 40 (SV40) is the prototype example of a polyomavirus that stimulates Akt activation by inhibiting the dephosphorylation of Akt.43 To do this, the SV40 small t antigen of SV40 (SV40ST) binds the cellular phosphatase PP2A that is responsible for a large fraction of Akt phosphatase activity.44 PP2A is a heterotrimeric protein comprising a scaffolding subunit (A), a catalytic subunit (C), and a regulatory subunit (B). There are many variants of the B subunit, and each is believed to be responsible for directing the phosphatase catalytic subunit directly to a single substrate (such as Akt) or set of substrates. SV40ST displaces the B subunit from the A and C PP2A subunits, inhibiting much of the phosphatase activity which would normally dampen or reverse Akt and mTOR activation (see Fig. 2). The resulting potentiation of Akt signaling helps drive cell proliferation, moving the cell into S phase, where virus DNA synthesis is initiated.",

Hepatitis C, another flavivirus, has not been reported to activate either PI3K or Akt but has been shown to promote cell survival through the activation of the downstream effector, mTOR kinase.71 This activation is facilitated by the viral nonstructural protein NS5A, which has the capacity to bind directly to FKBP38, a negative regulator of mTOR72 (see Fig. 3). The association of FKBP38 with mTORC1 is blocked by NS5A binding, thereby stimulating mTORC1 activity, promoting translation, and limiting apoptosis.

For vaccinia, cowpox,86 and myxoma viruses,87 PI3K/Akt activity is rapidly induced following productive infection. This activation appears to play at least three distinct roles during poxvirus infection. One is the suppression of apoptosis, which has been suggested to be important to allow proper viral replication.86 The second is the promotion of assembly of the eIF4F translation initiation factor complex through mTOR-mediated inhibition of 4E-BP1 function. This promotes virus mRNA translation.88, 89 PI3K/Akt activity appears to be especially critical for allowing the transcription of mRNAs that encode for proteins involved in the assembly and budding of poxviruses.86 The third role for PI3K/Akt is at a late stage of viral infection, where it is important for the proper progression of morphogenesis.89, 90 Addition of PI3K inhibitors during infection or deletion of the p85 alpha and beta subunits of PI3K altered multiple aspects of vaccinia replication.90 Of note were a decrease in late gene expression and the progression of the virus particle from an immature form to the intracellular mature virus.",

NS1 binds to p85 at a coiled-coil region of p85,99, 100 relieving contacts between p85 and p110 subunit of PI3K that normally inhibit activity.

This immune suppression occurs through the decreased proliferation and responsiveness of lymphocytes.112, 113 While it is not fully understood how measles induces immune cell quiescence, recent studies point to a strong role of the PI3K/Akt pathway in this effect. Both in vivo and in vitro, the attachment of measles virus to the surface of T cells, can force Akt dephosphorylation in uninfected cells (Fig. 4\n). This inactivation of PI3K/Akt signaling is not a consequence of infection but merely requires virus binding to a cell surface receptor.114 The receptor that is responsible for signaling this downregulation is currently unidentified, but following the binding of measles virus particles to the cell surface, there is both a decrease in PI3K and Akt signaling and an upregulation of the inositol phosphatase SIP110115 that lowers the overall level of PIP3 in the cell membrane. This promotes long-term suppression of PI3K/Akt signaling. The artificial stimulation of Akt activity overcomes measles-induced immunosuppression, suggesting that the inhibition of Akt is a central cause of measles virus-induced immune suppression.",

This latter conclusion is supported by reports showing that the PI3K/Akt pathway controls interferon production in dendritic cells130, 131 and that it is important for controlling an autophagy-based antiviral response.120 This suggests that such an approach is unlikely to succeed as a broad-spectrum approach.

If the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is just as essential for host response and survival as it is for viral function, inactivation is not an effective response for the infected host. Similarly, for viruses that have adapted to activate the pathway and that rely on the downstream effect of this activation, they must also contend with \u201cunwelcome\u201d results of such pathway activation, including the stimulation of cytokine production. This suggests that PI3K/Akt signaling is part of the evolutionary \u201cred queen race\u201d between virus and host, where virus attempts at controlling the host cell are often thwarted by host evolution.",

The PI3K/Akt phosphorylation cascade is an emerging paradigm for how these interactions occur. Many viruses have incorporated methods to activate PI3K/Akt signaling in order to forestall apoptosis, drive the cell cycle, and thereby support their replication processes. Somewhat paradoxically, other viruses have evolved an opposite approach, short-circuiting the PI3K/Akt signaling axis. In this latter case, viruses appear to benefit from the repression of the host antiviral response that comes from blocking Akt signaling. Why do different viruses, some from the same families, take different approaches? This is a question that will need to be answered in future research.",

Some significant progress has been made already. The phosphorylation of host factors such as the mTOR substrate 4E-BP is important for the robust translation of many viral messages, and it is likely that other Akt substrates that stimulate translation will also be sown to be important. It is likely that still more Akt-regulated phosphoproteins play a role in viral processes. Perhaps the most obvious but most poorly understood is the possibility that viral proteins themselves serve as substrates for Akt or effectors such as mTOR and GSK3. Recent work has suggested that Akt may phosphorylate the phosphoprotein of several negative-stranded RNA viruses60 and that it may also control calicivirus polymerase function.133 Future discoveries will likely greatly expand the number of viral substrates and more clearly point out the viral dependencies on this signaling axis.",

The diagram illustrates the two subunits of PI3K (p85 and p110) bound to an activated receptor tyrosine kinase (classical examples are the epidermal growth factor and the insulin receptor). Active PI3K catalyzes the addition of a single phosphate to the 3 position of PIP4,5-bisphosphate to make PIP3. This triphosphorylated inositol serves as an affinity ligand for the pleckstrin homology domains of the Akt kinase PDK1 and Akt, with the binding of PIP3 by the Akt PH domain serving to uncover the activation domain of Akt. Phosphorylation by PDK1 occurs at position T308, and a second activating phosphorylation occurs at S473. Active Akt will phosphorylate various downstream protein targets that control cell growth (AMPK, p21, and GSK3 are illustrated) and translational control (mTOR and its downstream effectors p70S6K and 4E-BP1 are illustrated) and act to suppress apoptosis (inhibitory phosphorylation of BAD and FOXO1 are illustrated).",

Also shown is vCrk, which stimulates Akt signaling in a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-dependent manner. Illustrated on the right-hand side of the figure is the SV40 small t (smt) protein. The smt protein binds the PP2A/C heterodimer and inactivates Akt dephosphorylation, providing an indirect but potent activation of Akt kinase activity.
