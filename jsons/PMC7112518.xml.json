For examples, the daily activities of cows (eating, lying down,\nand standing) can be modeled by a dynamical network, where local dynamics of each cow is\ndescribed by an oscillator of a piecewise linear dynamical system.1 The authors in Ref. 1\nnot only studied interesting dynamics such as synchronization but also developed some\nbiological predictions. Many other examples can be found in Ref. 2. Now, let us ask: when an infectious disease spreads among these cows,\nwhat is the impact on their synchronous behavior? Can then this synchronous behavior weaken\nor strengthen the disease spread process? We feel that these problems can be resolved by\nexamining the interplay between the collective and spreading dynamics on complex\nnetworks.",

The correlation between traffic flow and\nepidemic spreading on complex networks was investigated numerically and theoretically in\nRef. 3, for the case where the epidemic incidence was\nshaped by traffic-flow conditions and epidemic pathways were defined and driven by flows.\nThe results in Ref. 3 provided a general framework for\nus to understand the spreading processes on complex traffic networks. We have investigated\nmathematically the correlation between the dynamical synchronization and the epidemic\nbehavior on complex networks,4 and a very\nexplicit condition for synchronization with respect to the epidemic rate was obtained.\nHowever, in this case, we only considered a special collective behavior, i.e., global\nsynchronization. Moreover, the correlation between the dynamical synchronization and the\nepidemic behavior is unidirectional, i.e., the spreading behavior can influence the\ndynamical synchronization, but not vice versa. So, in this paper, we will extend our former\nresearch work to consider that the correlation between the collective behavior and the\nspread behavior is bidirectional and address further phase synchronization which may be a\nmore general collective behavior.",

In this\ncase, the individuals do not exhibit collective behavior since the spread will die out and\nits prevalence is too small to keep them close. By increasing the spreading rate to\n\u03bb=0.3\nin Fig. 3, the synchronization is achieved and\nspreading also becomes endemic. Moreover, a very interesting phenomenon is that the total\ndensity I(t) is oscillating, which is also found in\nadaptive epidemic networks.10,11 If\nthe collective behavior fails to influence the spreading, i.e., setting\n\u03b1=1,\nthen the total density I(t) will converge monotonically to\na larger value. From this simulation, we can see that the collective behavior can inhibit\ngreatly the spreading behavior.",
