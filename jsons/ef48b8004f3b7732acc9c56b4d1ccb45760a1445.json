THERAFLEX UV-Platelets (Macopharma, Tourcoing, France) is a novel method for pathogen inactivation treatment of platelet concentrates (PCs) [5] [6] [7] . This purely physical system is based on shortwave UVC light, which penetrates the fluid of PCs and inactivates micro-organisms and leucocytes by damaging nucleic acids. THERAFLEX MB-Plasma (Macopharma) is a photodynamic pathogen inactivation procedure for treatment of plasma [8, 9] . Plasma units derived from single blood donations are illuminated with visible light in the presence of the phenothiazine dye methylene blue (MB). When plasma is MB/light-treated, singlet oxygen is generated, which leads to the destruction of viral nucleic acids. The MB/light-based method is in routine use in Europe for about 17 years [10].",

SARS-CoV was also included in the study to confirm the efficacy of the two pathogen inactivation systems for coronaviruses, as has previously been demonstrated for MERS-CoV [14] . The results of this study show that both pathogen inactivation systems effectively inactivated all three viruses spiked into the PC and plasma samples, even at light dose increments below the full doses recommended by the manufacturers. One limitation of this study is that the number of replicates was small due to safety constraintslaboratory studies with these zoonotic viruses must be performed in accordance with the highest biosafety requirements. In addition, large-volume plating which would have allowed increasing the sensitivity of the assay and consequently improving the log reduction value could not be performed. SARS-CoV is an enveloped, positive-sense singlestranded RNA coronavirus. It emerged in 2002 in China and spread to 29 additional countries and is thought to be an animal virus that spread to humans from civets most likely infected by bats [27] . Similar to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the main route of human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV is nosocomial transmission. However, transmission between family members has also been observed, suggesting that SARS-CoV might continue to spread via transmission by infected persons returning from affected areas. Transmission by blood transfusion has not been described yet. Nevertheless, the high mortality of the disease and the not yet fully understood transmission mechanisms of SARS-CoV pose a potential threat to the safety of the blood supply [27] . Interestingly, the detection of low-level viremia in asymptomatic patients during an SARS-CoV outbreak suggests a theoretical risk of transmission via blood products. As a precautionary measure, the World Health Organization introduced a recommendation for the deferral of blood donations from donors potentially exposed to SARS-CoV, and the Australian Red Cross Blood Service amended its donor screening questionnaire to include questions to identify persons with SARS-CoVrelated symptoms [28] .",

The available data, particularly the findings on viral load in different body fluids, are too limited to provide a full understanding of its transmission routes [33] .

The incubation period of up to 14 days and the occurrence of latent infections with subsequent reactivation of NiV months and even years after exposure suggest that infected persons may be overlooked by donor screening programmes.

If one or more of these viruses is transfusion transmissible, its threshold concentration to elicit disease must be examined to determine whether the capacity of these pathogen inactivation technologies to inactivate the respective virus in plasma and PCs is sufficient to prevent transfusion transmission. Interpreting pathogen load in relationship to infectivity and inactivation efficacy is generally a very complex task [34] . When attempting to do so, it is important to consider that because quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), the most commonly used approach, measures viral load by detecting a small fragment of the viral genome, the results may not reflect infectivity and that qPCR usually overestimates the titre of circulating infectious agents [34] . In contrast, infectivity assays, which were used in this and previous studies [5, [12] [13] [14] , determine the inactivation capacity of a pathogen inactivation method based on intact, functional viral units. Nevertheless, the log reduction factors observed in this study and the safety margins calculated from the inactivation levels achieved using only a fraction of the standard light dose suggest that the THERA-FLEX UV-Platelets and THERAFLEX MB-Plasma pathogen inactivation technologies may effectively reduce the potential risk of SARS-CoV, CCHFV and NiV and related viruses for platelet or plasma transfusion.",
