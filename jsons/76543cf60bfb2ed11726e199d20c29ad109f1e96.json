Based on an analysis of academic papers, World Health Organization reports and newspapers, this research compares two opposing approaches, whereas the Chinese cities and government have adopted a techno-driven approach, Western governments have adopted a human-driven approach to control the transmission of Covid-19. The findings highlight that although the techno driven approach may be more productive to identify, isolate and quarantine infected individuals, it also results in the suppression and censoring the citizen views. It is further emphasized that human interaction with the technology is mediated by the political and institutional context in which the technologies are implemented. This paper contributes to literature by understanding the humantechnology relationship, and offers five practical observations for controlling virus transmissions during pandemics.",

Novel Coronavirus is the most recent pandemic that has resulted in unprecedented social and economic impact on society. Covid-19 is one of a large group of viruses that was transmitted to humans from bats in a local live animal market in Wuhan in late 2019 (Ji et al., 2020) . It infects the upper respiratory tract and can result in pneumonia and other associated illnesses, which can eventually affect the central nervous system, ultimately leading to death for those with underlying health conditions. Given the potential for human-to-human transmission and that inventing a vaccine would ideally take about one or two years, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that governments worldwide should quickly intensify active surveillance to identify infected individuals to allow rapid isolation and quarantine (Heymann & Shindo, 2020) .",

This research argues that the impact of the human-driven approach is slower than the techno-driven approach in controlling the transmission of the virus.

Similar to the Chinese context, population growth in urban areas has resulted in cities, especially in North America and Europe, adopting smart city technologies (Albino, Berardi, & Dangelico, 2015) . The European Union, for example, initiated several strategies including the European Smart Cities & Communities initiative (Kylili & Fokides, 2015) , and the European Innovation Partnership for Smart Cities and Communities (Cardullo & Kitchin, 2019) . These programs allow European cities access resources from the European Commission to transform their cities into smart cities. Most Covid-19 affected countries in the Western context are known for their advanced smart cities. These countries are highly interconnected with each other largely due to their geographical proximity and the trading partnerships they have with China. This is the reason the Covid-19 pandemic was able to easily transfer to the major cities in these countries from China (Cohen & Kupferschmidt, 2020) .",

This approach resonates with 'soft technological determinism' where individuals retain agency in determining technological use (Pool, 1983; Nograsek and Vintar, 2014) . Under this approach, governments also enhance social and human capital among their citizens which allow developing technologies based on the local need. There is an overall understanding that human-driven approach allows governments adopt smart technologies to ensure better citizen engagement, to offer accountab ility (Gil-Garcia et al., 2016; Mora et al. 2019c) , and streamline interactions between communities and government (Androutsopoulou et al., 2019) . Additionally, citizens seek greater participation in the planning of urban development strategies, often initiating local enterprises (Kummitha, 2019) .

WHO has urged the Chinese government, medical community and scientists to publish information actively about the emergent trends. As the virus transmitted to other parts of the globe towards the end of January, Western media have made a significant effort to show how technology has been used by Western democracies in controlling the transmission. Further, the scientific publishing houses have fast tracked publishing on Covid-19 and made all the published research openly available for anyone to use. In addition, media outlets have shown keen interest in not only publishing current trends but also various interventions being initiated to control the outbreak.

It is followed by the Shenzhen smart city which has 159 cameras per every 1000 residents, then the Shanghai smart city with 113 cameras, the Tianjin smart city with 93, and the Jinan smart city with 73 cameras, all per every 1000 people.

Drones equipped with cameras and controlled by operators were further deployed for conducting surveillance and issuing instructions and warnings to those failing to wear masks or failing to follow the emergency protocols. In cases where citizens failed to report their travel history in the affected areas, IoT devices were used to ascertain their travel history and flag those cases (Liu & Li, 2020) . For instance, the travel of individuals to the affected areas was monitored and reported to the concerned authorities by AI applications (Jie, 2020) . In addition, corporations allowed the government to access their systems hosting the mobile applications (apps) that citizens routinely use to track down their travel history. For instance, apps such as Alipay and WeChat which are popularly used across China, helped the government to track down those who were infected (Kupfeschmidt & Cohen, 2020) .",

When it comes to the governance aspect, Chinese smart cities have actively coordinated where the majority of interventions have been drawn from the central government . In comparison, lack of coordination in the Western context between the cities, regional governments and the national governments have contributed to the quick transmission of the virus. When it comes to adopting ubiquitous technologies, China draws its strategies based on a techno-driven perspective, where its well established technological ecosystem has been mobilized to impose technological solutions (Hu & Zheng, 2020) . In Western democracies, technologies are selectively used, partly due to the human-driven approach adopted in promoting technological ecosystems that allow limited use of technologies. For instance, Western democracies continue to rely on anonymous data, which may not be as effective as collecting data from individuals (Stamali et al. 2015) . The data protection laws in the Western democracies ensure personal data protection. Such a provision limits the governments optio ns to collect data from citizens directly. As Caraglu et al. (2011) highlighted, these smart cities focus on social J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f inclusion, knowledge networks, voluntary organizations, and social and relational capital, in addition to achieving social and environmental sustainability. The overall intention is to empower communities as smart communities which are able to develop their own smart technologies and use them for solving urban problems. In order to enhance creativity among citizens, these smart cities have invested in building city-level ecosystems that can bring government, communities, private firms and universities together, so that cities act as clusters of innovation to enable and facilitate the invention of technologies that look after their needs and bring competitive advantages to the cities (Kummitha & Crutzen, 2019) .",

While conventionally, societal needs and norms determine individual behavior, modern days mark the enhanced use of technologies to impose discipline and compliance.

Earlier research has articulated that smart city initiatives often lack the engagement of social and political conditions (Luq ue-Ayala & Marvin, 2015) .

Governments also need to ensure that the enhanced collection and use of data will be temporary and the activity will cease once the situation comes under control. In this way, governments will be able to assure their citizens about their rights and the governmental responsibility to protect these rights. Such an approach allows citizens to voluntarily come forward to communicate their health data and download dedicated mobile apps to share their health updates and location histories. In countries where the top-down adoption of technologies is impossible, this approach allows crowdsourcing the information from citizens.

While Chinese smart cities have actively coordinated and let the national government take control over the regions in a techno-driven approach, the smart cities in the Western democracies have initially lacked in their coordination efforts with the national governments and adopted a human-driven approach to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f control the transmission. Although both China and Western democracies have well-established technological regimes, technological usage differed significantly in both contexts, largely as a result of constraints imposed by the political and institutional environments. While in the Chinese context, governments adopted top-down technologies to discipline and censor their citizens, in the Western context, technologies were used to inform, persuade and attain consensus among citizens to help limit virus transmission. In both contexts, findings highlight that humans mediate with the technologies and limit their impacts. However, there is an overall concern that governments may take advantage of the Covid-19 to reinforce technological visioning on citizens beyond controlling the pandemic.",

First, given the ongoing nature of Covid-19, the issues highlighted in this article may continue to evolve. Second, the newspaper-based analysis used in this article was unstructured. For instance, experts have specifically raised their concerns about China's capabilities regarding censorship. They argue that the WHO and the Western media have largely relied on the information censored by the Chinse government to make their arrangements (Jong, 2020). Hence, these findings need to be generalized with caution. The Covid-19 outbreak is not only about health care, but also businesses, livelihoods, wellbeing, innovation and resilience. While medical researchers and scientists are active in bringing out new findings and data about the pandemic, scholars from other disciplines should come forward and contribute to advancing our combined potential to face this pandemic. In particular, it would be interesting to understand how cities and governments in other countries are handling the pandemic. Further research may focus on rural J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f areas as well to understand the strategies rural communities and governments adopt to limit the transmission.",

It will also be interesting to study how service firms, including essential delivery services, have used technology to aid delivery. For instance, Lin (2020) shows that during the lockdowns grocery orders were delivered in 20 minutes in major cities in China. However, we need more evidence from different parts of the globe. There is also evidence that community-based initiatives, both technological and non-technological in nature, are in effect to serve the most needy and vulnerable. For instance, community-based apps, such as the Nextdoor app, offer necessary support for those in need in the community. Thus, it is worthwhile to study community-level resilience and how it supplements or even replaces technological responses to handling the pandemic. The other research avenue is to study how governments, technology firms and international agencies address the infodemic to control fake news. Overall, research on the technological innovations, local community active participation to build resilience, partnerships being built to contain the outbreak, and process innovations could build the resilience of cities and help address the current and future outbreaks.",

It will be worthwhile to study how various technologies have been useful for workers, universities and businesses. For social scientists, it is an opportunity to study several rarely experienced occurrences. What happens when everyone works from home, universities go online, communities follow social distancing, and governments are free to collect whatever information they wish to collect or make new provisions and laws to enhance their own powers, thus J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof curtailing human rights and citizen privacy (Harari, 2020) . While the majority of these changes will return to previous normality in due course, governments may continue to employ some measures that restrict the freedom and powers of individuals. For example, the National Assembly of Hungary voted to confer sweeping powers to the government to rule by decree during the Covid-19 emergency. Thus, it would be interesting to understand what kind of impact such developments leave on the society. Further, it is also worthwhile to study how the technologies and innovations employed by the governments to control the Covid-19 transmission are used beyond the pandemic control and how citizens react to them.",

Overall, the acts of censorship and the concealment of information resulted in reducing the potential of technologies to be harnessed to effectively communicate about the virus.Compared to the Chinese context, Western democracies had plenty of time to plan their management of the crisis before potentially identifying transmitted cases in their regions.However, governments to different extents downplayed the potential of transmission and the damage it could cause. For instance, the president of the USA was vocal until the second week of March that the damage would be minimal. A similar strategy was visible in the case of the UK.",

However, Western democracies may choose much more holistic approaches by the means of consensus and persuasion, where technologies are used to educate citizens and ensure their compliance with the rules set forth. Under such circumstances, controlling the transmission of the pandemic may be slow and time-consuming. Although technological ecosystems are J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f active in Western democracies, they are mostly oriented towards adopting human-driven approach. Despite the positive effect in controlling the transmission in the Chine se context, the authoritative nature of the political establishment has, in fact, limited the potential of the technology itself through censorship. Concealing information about the virus for over a month allowed it to transmit among the population and across regions. As a result, the nature of the political and institutional context moderates the level of surveillance and discipline imposed. The political and institutional context played a major role in limiting technological determinism",
