            "text": "The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 reinforces the potential of lethal pandemics of respiratory viral infections. The underlying mechanisms of SARS are still largely undefined. Long pentraxin PTX3, a humoral mediator of innate immunity, has been reported to have anti-viral effects. We examined the role of PTX3 in coronavirus murine hepatitis virus strain 1 (MHV-1)-induced acute lung injury, a previously reported animal model for SARS. PTX3-deficient mice (129/SvEv/C57BL6/J) and their wild-type (WT) littermates were intranasally infected MHV-1. These mice were also treated with recombinant PTX3. Effects of PTX3 on viral binding and infectivity were determined in vitro. Cytokine expression, severity of lung injury, leukocyte infiltration and inflammatory responses were examined in vivo. In PTX3 WT mice, MHV-1 induced PTX3 expression in the lung and serum in a time-dependent manner. MHV-1 infection led to acute lung injury with greater severity in PTX3-deficient mice than that in WT mice. PTX3 deficiency enhanced early infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages in the lung. PTX3 bound to MHV-1 and MHV-3 and reduced MHV-1 infectivity in vitro. Administration of recombinant PTX3 significantly accelerated viral clearance in the lung, attenuated MHV-1-induced lung injury, and reduced early neutrophil influx and elevation of inflammatory mediators in the lung. Results from this study indicate a protective role of PTX3 in coronaviral infection-induced acute lung injury.",

PTX3 treatment attenuated virulence in vitro and in vivo, and showed potential therapeutic effects by reducing the virus load and enhancing the survival of infected animals. 21 Smits et al., 22 found that PTX3, among other genes, such as VCAM1, F3 and IL-8, was significantly increased after SARS-CoV infection in aged macaques.",

We used MHV-1 to examine the PTX3 response to the viral infection, compared the susceptibility of PTX3 deficient mice to their wild-type (WT) littermates, and evaluated the potential therapeutic effects of exogenous PTX3. 23 Mice were genotyped by PCR with two pairs of primers designed against murine PTX3 Exon 2 and human HPRT contained in the targeting vector (Figure 1a ). 23 The specificity of PCR genotyping (Figure 1b ) was validated by Southern blot (Figure 1c ). All animals used were 8-12 weeks Viral Infection and PTX3 Treatment In Vivo PTX3-KO and -WT mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with 0.2 ml 10% pentobarbital diluted in normal saline, and received an intranasal inoculation of MHV-1 (either 5000 or 10 000 PFU) in 50 ml ice-cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), or same volume of DMEM as mock infection controls. Symptoms including ruffled fur, tremors and lack of activity were monitored daily. 4 To assess lung injury, mice were killed at day 1, 2, 4, 8 and 14 post infection with 4-6 PTX3-KO or -WT mice at each time point. For PTX3 treatment, PTX-KO and -WT mice were infected intranasally with 5000 PFU of MHV-1 and then immediately treated with either 50 ml of phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) or recombinant PTX3 (2 mg/kg in PBS) intranasally. The same dose of PTX3 was administrated intraperitoneally to animals at 6 and 24 h post infection. 20, 21 Mice were killed at day 2 post infection (4 mice/group). Blood was collected by cardiac puncture, and serum was isolated and stored at \u00c080 1C until use. The left lung was fixed for histological and immunohistochemical studies. The remaining lung tissue was snap-frozen and stored at \u00c080 1C for virus titer and cytokine analysis.",

            "text": "In the present study, we have shown that PTX3 deficiency enhanced susceptibility to MHV-1 pulmonary infection, and administration of exogenous PTX3 ameliorated lung injury. The innate immunity response is the first line of host defense against viral infection. Proteomic analysis of plasma from SARS patients showed increased acute-phase proteins, such as serum amyloid A and MBL (mannose-binding lectin). 31 Long pentraxin PTX3, a member of pentraxin super family, is also an acute phase protein and has been defined as a key prototypic component of the humoral arm of innate immunity. 12 PTX3 is of particular interest due to its local expression from a variety of tissues at the site of infection and inflammation. 12, 13, 27 PTX3 has a critical role in host defense against pulmonary infection caused by fungus, 17 bacteria, 18 cytomegalovirus and certain strains of influenza viruses. 20, 21 In the present study, MHV-1 infection induced a dosedependent increase of PTX3 in the lung in WT mice and caused more severe lung injury in PTX3-deficient animals. Recombinant PTX3 significantly reduced lung injury in PTX3-KO and littermate WT mice. The reduction of exogenous PTX3 on acute lung injury is more effective in the PTX3-KO mice than in the WT mice. This may be due to the dose used, timing or route of administration, and does not rule out an effect of PTX3, but it should be further studied. The genetic background of mice in the present study is 129/ SvEv/C57BL6/J. We have shown that the severity of acute lung injury induced by airway infection of MHV-1 varies depending upon the strains of mice. 4 The function of PTX3 in different strains of mice thus merits further investigation. This will be clinically relevant because the susceptibility of patients to SARS-CoV also varies. Different strains of mouseadapted SARS-CoV have been developed by Subbarao's 6 and Barnard's groups, 7 respectively. It would be interesting to further test the potential protective effects of PTX3 with these viruses, which may be more directly relevant to SARS. One of the important functions of the pentraxin family is pathogen recognition. It has been reported that PTX3 can bind to cytomegaloviruses 20 and to influenza viruses. 21 A dose-dependent binding between PTX3 and MHV viruses was found in the present study. PTX3 reduced MHV-1 viral infectivity in cell culture. Exogenous PTX3 enhanced virus clearance from the infected lungs. As binding of PTX3 was found in two MHV strains (MHV-1 and MHV-3), PTX3 may also bind to other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV, and facilitate their clearance from the infected lungs.",

Furthermore, neutrophil infiltration was enhanced in the lungs of PTX3-deficient mice, which was attenuated by PTX3 treatment. We have shown that PTX3 deficiency also worsens the lung injury induced by lipopolysaccharide. 36 These findings are consistent with a newly defined anti-inflammatory role of PTX3 in the recruitment of inflammatory cells, in which PTX3 binds to P-selectin and attenuates neutrophil migration to the sites of inflammation. 37 Therefore, in addition to its effects on viral binding and facilitating viral clearance, it is reasonable to speculate that the regulatory function of PTX3 on inflammatory responses may confer further protective effects in coronavirus-induced lung injury. It has been shown that the severity of pulmonary lesions induced by MHV 38 Therefore, inhibition of inflammatory responses is important in protecting the lung from injury.",

Alveolar macrophages are not only key effector cells of the innate immune response to pathogen invasion, 39 but may also be able to modulate excessive inflammation and render an immune-suppressive effect in the lung. 40 Unlike neutrophil influx, which decreased 1 week after MHV-1 infection and was inhibited by PTX3 treatment, macrophage infiltration remained elevated in the lung even at 2 weeks post MHV-1 infection. PTX3 administration further increased the influx of macrophages in the lungs of PTX3 KO mice. We speculate that macrophages may have an important role in anti-viral immunity, viral clearance and lung tissue repair, although the mechanisms for this effect remains undefined at this time. MCP-1 (CCL2) and MIP-1b (CCL4) are chemokines related to monocyte recruitment. Interestingly, both of these chemokines were down-regulated by exogenous PTX treatment in the lung of PTX3 KO mice. It is possible that in PTX3 KO mice, the regulation of macrophages in the lung is altered owing to unknown compensatory mechanisms.",
