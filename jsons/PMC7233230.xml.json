The general information (age, sex, vital signs, coexisting disorders), clinical data, laboratory data, and radiological characteristics data of the patients were extracted from electronic medical records. Among the 238 recruited patients, 153 patients were laboratory-confirmed cases, who were tested positive for viral RNA using real time RT-PCR assay on pharyngeal swab specimens. The remaining 85 patients, who had negative results from the real time RT-PCR assay, were clinically diagnosed as highly-suspected cases according to the notice on the issuance of strategic guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 [21]. Suspected cases were diagnosed as long as they had one of the following epidemiological history: (a) travel or residence history in Wuhan or other areas where local cases continue to spread within 14 days before onset; (b) having contacted with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan or other areas where local cases continue to spread within 14 days before onset; (c) epidemiologically relevant to cluster disease or people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and two of the following clinical manifestations: (a) fever; (b) chest imaging features; (c) normal or decreased white blood cell count in the early stage of onset, or decreased lymphocyte count. The serum samples were collected once from each recruited patient. Meanwhile, the control consisted of serum samples randomly selected from 70 ordinary patients and 50 healthy blood donors. The study was approved by the Hospital Ethics Committee and written informed consent was waived for emerging infectious diseases.",

            "text": "To study the diagnostic value of ELISA assay for virus-specific antibodies, especially in the early stages of the disease, we tried to analyze the positive rates of ELISA and RT-PCR assays across the different stages of the disease. To this end, each patient was assigned to different days after initial onset of symptoms based on the time of blood collection for ELISA assays. For viral nucleic acid test, each patient was assigned to different days after initial onset of symptoms based on the time when the pharyngeal swab specimen was detected to be positive or the last recoded detection was still negative. The positive rates of viral RNA, IgM, and/or IgG were compared every day after initial onset of symptoms (Table 2\n). Due to having a low number of samples for each individual day, we pooled the samples in which the positive rates were similar in consecutive days. Thus, the disease process was divided into five phases of 0\u20135 days, 6\u201310 days, 11\u201312 days, 13\u201315 days and more than 16 days after initial onset of symptoms (Table 3\n& Fig. 2\n). The data show that the positive rates of IgM and/or IgG are extremely low in the first five days after initial onset of symptoms because no antibodies are produced in the majority of patients at this early stage, and rapidly increase as the disease progresses. Day 11 after initial onset of symptoms is a key point because the positive rates of IgM and/or IgG jump to over 80% from less than 50%. The sensitivity of antibody detection reaches to more than 93% since day 11 after initial onset of symptoms. This dynamic trend is consistent with SARS-CoV infection [22]. In comparison, the real-time RT-PCR was more effective for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection than ELISA in the early stage of the disease. The positive rate of viral RNA detected by RT-PCR was maintained above 60% in the first 11 days after initial onset of symptoms, and rapidly decreased with the rapid increase of antibodies. These results demonstrate that ELISA-based IgM and/or IgG detection should be used as a major viral diagnostic test for patients with symptoms for more than 10 days. Given that 50% of clinically suspected patients with symptoms for 6\u201310 days were detected to be positive by ELISA-based IgM and/or IgG detection (Table 4\n), the combination of ELISA and RT-PCR assays will greatly improve the detection efficacy, even in the early stage of the COVID-19 infection.",

Although serological assay is a frequently used method for viral infection screening and diagnosis, there are few reports on serological assay in the detection of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we evaluate the application of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein-based ELISA for detection of IgM and IgG antibodies in admitted hospital patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections. The results show that the positive rate of antibodies detected by ELISA was significantly higher than that of viral RNA detected by real-time RT-PCR across all the enrolled patients, suggesting that antibody detection is more sensitive than viral nucleic acid test to diagnose SARS-CoV2 infection. More importantly, the suspected patients exhibited nearly the same antibody detection rate as the confirmed patients. This data strongly demonstrates that the majority of suspected patients, who were tested negative for viral RNA, were in fact infected by SARS-CoV-2.",

The positive rates of nucleic acid test and serological assay in total populations cannot reflect their diagnostic value in surveillance and control of the disease. In order to objectively determine the disease stage of the patients, we used the initial onset of symptoms exhibited by the patients as the starting time point. All patients were defined to different stages of disease based on when the test sample was collected. The dynamics patterns of positive rates of viral RNA and antiviral antibodies confirmed the rationality of the definition of disease stage. Our analysis identified the 11th day after initial onset of symptoms as a key time point in the disease process. This is when most infected patients produce antiviral antibodies. After the 11th day, the diagnosis of viral infection should mainly depend on serological assays. Before the 11th day, the nucleic acid test is important for confirmation of viral infection. The combination of serological assay and viral nucleic acid test can greatly improve the diagnostic efficacy. Our conclusions closely align with that of to several recently published papers [23,24] further demonstrating the importance of serological testing in the diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
