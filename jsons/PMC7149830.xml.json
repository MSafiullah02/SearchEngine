These cells are considerably more important than the Kupffer cells in removing particulates from the bloodstream. Thus 86% of injected streptococci were removed in the lungs as opposed to 14% in the livers of cats. The presence of this population of cells may explain why cats are more susceptible than other mammals to septic shock mediated by macrophage-derived tumor necrosis factor (TNF). The lymph nodes, spleen, tonsils, Peyer's patches, bone marrow and thymus are of comparable structure to that seen in other mammals. The thymus appears in fetal kittens at 28 days after conception.",

Both T helper and T suppressor cell activities have been identified in the cat. About 20% of feline peripheral blood lymphocytes lack both T and B cell markers. These null cells, found both in immune and nonimmune animals, can destroy tumor cells or virus-infected cells. They are thus assumed to be natural killer (NK) cells.

Adult cat sera, colostral whey, tears and nasal secretions contain IgG, IgM and IgA. Electrophoretic analysis suggests that there are at least three IgG isotypes\u2013G1, G2 and G3\u2013and preliminary evidence suggests the existence of a fourth. A reaginic antibody obtained from a cat infected with the microfilariae of Brugia pahangi has been characterized and had properties compatible with IgE. Given the recent evidence that some mammals, pigs for example, have no \u03b4 chain genes and cannot make any IgD, it is not unlikely that cats may also lack this isotype. Lambda (\u03bb) is the predominant light chain type in the cat, accounting for 80\u201390% of light chains. In common with other mammals with placentas impermeable to immunoglobulins, female cats are obliged to transfer antibodies to their offspring through colostrum. As a result, IgG, IgM and IgA are present in colostral whey in high concentrations (Table 1\n). As lactation proceeds and immunoglobulin levels drop, IgG remains the major immunoglobulin class in cat milk. IgM and IgA are the predominant immunoglobulins in cat bile. IgA is the predominant immunoglobulin in intestinal and respiratory mucus and in tears. As in other species, cat secretory IgA is a J chain-linked dimer. Immunoglobulins cannot be detected in the urine of adult cats but may be found in the urine of suckling kittens. This may reflect the excretion of small immunoglobulin fragments absorbed by the intestine from colostrum.",

(Only about 25% of cats rejecting allografts produce lymphocytotoxic antibodies.) It may also be difficult to produce substantial mixed lymphocyte culture reactivity between some unrelated feline cells. Although it is possible that this may be due to a lack of FLA polymorphism, it is more likely to be due to a relatively low level of MHC expression on cat mononuclear cells. Thus genetic analysis indicates that the FLA system contains 10\u201320 class I gene loci, of which only two are expressed. Cats also possess five class II gene loci, of which only three are expressed. Feline class I antigens display 81\u201382% sequence identity with the human and 73\u201379% identity with the mouse homologs.

Thymic hypoplasia and lymphopenia have been reported in a Siberian tiger, while \u2018nude\u2019 cats \u2013 thymic aplasia and hypotrichosis \u2013 have been recorded in a litter of kittens. These kittens had no thymus, and showed lymphocyte depletion in T cell areas of the lymph nodes, spleen and Peyers patches. Their most common congenital defect in immune function is the Ch\u00e9diak\u2013Higashi syndrome. This is classically seen in some Persian cats. Affected animals show defects in pigmentation with a characteristic pale coat color and red tapetal light reflection. Their leukocytes contain enlarged lysosomal granules but increased susceptibility to infections has not been observed. Of considerably greater importance as a cause of feline disease is failure of passive transfer of colostral immunoglobulins. This results in the development of severe and intractable bacterial infections in newborn kittens. The most important cause of secondary immunodeficiency in the cat is FeLV infection. Despite its name, this virus usually causes severe immunodeficiency in infected animals. Kittens born to FeLV-infected queens may show thymic atrophy and depressed allograft responses, while infected adult cats may develop a panleukopenia. As a result, they die due to fulminating bacterial infections. Many cats with chronic bacterial or fungal infections such as pneumonias, abscesses and stomatitis are found to be FeLV infected. Feline panleukopenia, due to a parvovirus, also causes an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome with severe leukopenia and lethal secondary infections.",

            "text": "Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a widespread lentivirus that infects domestic and wild cats. Infection with this virus results in progressive depletion of CD4+ T lymphocytes. The resulting disease in many respects resembles human acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and is an important model of the human disease. FIV replicates preferentially in feline T lymphoblastoid cells and causes a characteristic cytopathic effect in vitro. The virus receptor is probably not mediated through fCD4 (which is expressed on only a subset of T cells) but through fCD9. Infection is also associated with a marked, polyclonal expansion of B cells and of a subset of fCD8+ cells. As a result the CD4:CD8 ratio can be reduced to as low as 1.6, compared with a normal ratio of 3.3. Kittens artificially infected with FIV initially exhibit few clinical signs, most notably anemia, lymphopenia, neutropenia and lymphadenopathy. Eventually a terminal AIDS-like illness develops. Natural FIV infections result in death as a result of secondary infections of the oral cavity, upper respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, skin or urinary system. Neurologic signs have also been described. Epidemiologic analysis suggests that FIV is mainly transmitted between cats by biting.",
