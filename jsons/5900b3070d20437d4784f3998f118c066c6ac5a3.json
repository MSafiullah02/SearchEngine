Patients with diabetes have an increased risk of severe complications including Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome and multi-organ failure. Depending on the global region, 20-50% of patients in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had diabetes. Given the importance of the link between COVID-19 and diabetes, we have formed an international panel of experts in the field of diabetes and endocrinology to provide some guidance and practical recommendations for the management of diabetes during the pandemic. We aim to briefly provide insight into potential mechanistic links between the novel coronavirus infection and diabetes, present practical management recommendations, and elaborate on the differential needs of several patient groups.",

Data from the early months of 2020 suggest that most people with COVID-19 have comorbidities, the most prevalent of which are diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. 1 A significant association with worse outcomes is seen in people with these comorbidities. 1 Studies have also shown that COVID-19 is associated with hyperglycaemia particularly in the elderly with type 2 diabetes. 2 In view of many uncertainties with COVID-19, a faculty of representatives from primary and specialist care have developed a consensus document on the management of diabetes for people at risk of or with confirmed COVID-19 for use in both primary and specialist care. The brief practical recommendations authored by this group were convened virtually. The recommendations are based on queries that have been emphasised to be important by clinicians, questions that have been raised by colleagues and social media, and recommendations guided by using focused-literature review. Clinical decision making in the manage ment of diabetes is already complex and in normal circumstances we recommend clinicians follow guidelines for management of people with diabetes. However, the recommendations authored by our group add to the existing guidelines by considering specific points for the management of patients with diabetes and COVID-19 disease or at risk for metabolic disease.",

            "text": "Diabetes is a primary risk factor for the development of severe pneumonia and a septic course due to virus infections and occurs in around 20% of patients. 3, 4 Diabetes was identified as a major contributor to disease severity and mortality in Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). 5 Evidence from epidemiological observations in regions heavily affected by SARS-CoV-2 and reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other national health centres and hospitals showed that the risk of a fatal outcome from COVID-19 is up to 50% higher in patients with diabetes than in those who do not have diabetes. 6 There are several hypotheses to explain the increased incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection in people with diabetes. In general, people with all forms of diabetes are at increased risk of infection because of defects in innate immunity affecting phagocytosis, neutrophil chemotaxis, and cell-mediated immunity; however, the high frequency of diabetes in serious cases of COVID-19 could potentially reflect the higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes in older people. Furthermore, diabetes in older age is associated with cardiovascular disease, which in itself could help to explain the association with fatal outcomes of There are at least two specific mechanisms that might play a role in COVID-19 infection. First, to gain entry to its target cells, the SARS-CoV-2 virus hijacks an endocrine pathway that plays a crucial role in blood pressure regulation, metabolism, and inflammation. 7 Angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the receptor for the coronavirus spike protein. ACE2 has protective effects primarily regarding inflammation. COVID-19 infection reduces ACE2 expression inducing cellular damage, hyperinflammation, and respiratory failure. 7 Acute hyperglycaemia has been shown to upregulate ACE2 expression on cells which might facilitate viral cell entry. However, chronic hyperglycaemia is known to downregulate ACE2 expression making the cells vulnerable to the inflammatory and damaging effect of the virus. Furthermore, the expression of ACE2 on pancreatic \u03b2 cells can lead to a direct effect on \u03b2 cell function. [8] [9] [10] Although these findings have not been verified in humans, they suggest that diabetes might not only be a risk factor for a severe form of COVID-19 disease but also that infection could induce new onset diabetes. [8] [9] [10] Potential \u03b2 cell damage caused by the virus leading to insulin deficiency is supported by the observation of Italian colleagues and co-authors of these recommen dations who have reported frequent cases of severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at the time of hospital admission. Another important observation by the coauthors from various centres in different countries affected by COVID-19 is the tremendous insulin requirement in patients with a severe course of the infection. To what extent COVID-19 plays a direct role in this high insulin resistance is unclear. According to the personal experiences of co-authors of this Personal View, the extent of insulin resistance in patients with diabetes seems dispro portionate compared with critical illness caused by other conditions.",

In cell studies, DPP-4 was identified as a functional receptor for human coronavirus-Erasmus Medical Center (hCoV-EMC), the virus responsible for MERS. 11 Antibodies directed against DPP-4 inhibited hCoV-EMC infection of primary cells. DPP-4 enzyme is an ubiquitously expressed type II transmembrane glycoprotein. It plays a major role in glucose and insulin metabolism but also increases inflammation in type 2 diabetes. 12 Whether these mechanisms also apply to COVID-19 and whether diabetes treatment with DPP-4 inhibitors in clinical practice influences the course of the infection is currently unknown, but, if these mechanisms translate to SARS-CoV-2, the use of these agents could reduce DPP-4 concentrations and could provide thera peutic opportunities for treatment of COVID-19. 12",

Therefore, continuation with an appropriate antihypertensive and lipid-lowering regimen in all these patients is of crucial importance. Treatment with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin 2 receptor blockers could increase the expression of ACE2, which could accelerate the entry of the virus into the cells. 13 However, as SARS-CoV-2 might impair the protective ACE2/Mas receptor pathway and increase deleterious angiotensin-2 activity, the use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin 2 receptor blockers could protect against severe lung injury following infection. On the basis of currently available evidence, we recommend that patients should continue with their antihypertensive regimens including ACE inhibitors and angiotensin 2 receptors. This view is endorsed by a recent position statement from the European Society of Cardiology and the Heart Failure Society of America, American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, who strongly recommended continuation of treatment with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin 2 receptor blockers. 14 Statins have been shown to restore the reduction of ACE2 induced by high lipids such as low density lipoprotein or lipoprotein(a). 15 The pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects of statins have been attributed to the upregulation of ACE2. However, although we believe that modulation of ACE2 expression is associated with both infection and mortality rates in COVID-19, statins should not be discontinued because of the long-term benefits and the potential for tipping the balance towards a cytokine storm by rebound rises in interleukin(IL)-6 and IL-1\u00df if they were to be discontinued. Given the close links between diabetes and cardiovascular disease, we recommend control of lipid concentrations in all patients with COVID-19.",

These individuals will need more intense monitoring and supportive therapy to reduce the risk of metabolic decompensation including DKA, in particular for those taking sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2). According to the expertise from the co-authors, an increase in the prevalence of severe DKA in COVID-19 positive patients with established type 1 diabetes has been observed, but this might in part be because of delayed hospital admission. Thus, making patients with type 1 diabetes aware of this complication and re-educating them about typical symptoms, home-measurement of urine or blood ketones, acute behaviour guidelines, and liberal and early inquiry of professional medical advice and sick day rules is crucial. Patients who have undergone transplantation of islets, pancreas or kidney, or those on immunosuppressive therapy will be at particularly increased risk; additionally, the potential effect of coronavirus infection on pancreatic function in this group is unknown and monitoring for a recurrence of insulin requirement in those who are insulin independent after their transplant is important.",

Therefore, patients with obesity and diabetes could be at specific risk of ventilatory failure and complications during mechanical ventilation. Clinical experience with young patients with obesity and COVID-19 supports this notion. Furthermore, individuals with obesity or with diabetes have an altered innate and adaptive immune response, characterised by a state of chronic and low-grade inflammation with higher concentrations of the pro-inflammatory leptin and lower anti-inflammatory adiponectin. 16 Additionally, obesity is often associated with physical inactivity leading to aggravated insulin resistance. This condition per se impairs immune response against microbial agents including macrophage activation and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and leads to a dysregulation of the immune response contributing to complications associated with obesity. 17 Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 can induce long-term metabolic alterations in patients who have been infected with the virus, as has been reported previously with the SARS virus. 18 Therefore, a careful cardiometabolic monitoring of patients who have survived severe COVID-19 disease might be necessary.",
