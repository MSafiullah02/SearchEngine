Drug-induced lung injuries (DLIs) can affect the airways, lung parenchyma, mediastinum, pleura, pulmonary vasculature, and/or neuromuscular system. The most common form of DLI is drug-induced interstitial lung disease (DILD). Orally and parenterally administered drugs are the most frequent causes of DLI; however, nebulized and intrathecal agents have also been implicated. DLI may result from a direct or indirect drug effect; direct effects may be idiosyncratic or caused by a toxic reaction to the drug or one of its metabolites.",

Histopathologic changes for most drug reactions are nonspecific, but some drugs (e.g., amiodarone) have a characteristic histopathologic pattern of involvement that enables almost instant recognition of the causative agent. Methotrexate, for example, causes acute granulomatous DILD, which mimics an opportunistic infection [27].",

Prognosis depends on the specific drug and underlying clinical, physiologic, and pathologic severity of lung disease. In addition, the clinical and radiographic features of DILD are often difficult to distinguish from those of other causes of DILD (e.g., infections, lung involvement of an underlying disease, pulmonary edema, connective tissue disease), and no signs, symptoms, or laboratory or radiologic findings are considered pathognomonic.
