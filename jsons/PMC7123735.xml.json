Over 80% of melanoma patients present with clinically localized disease and can be managed with resection of the primary tumor with or without sentinel lymph node biopsy (Balch et al. 2009). However, up to 10% of patients will develop recurrent locoregional disease (Borgstein et al. 1999). For isolated and resectable local and regional recurrences, complete excision of disease is the mainstay of therapy. However, patients often present with advanced, bulky, and unresectable disease either locally at the primary tumor site, in the regional nodal basin(s), or within the dermal lymphatic channels between the primary site and regional lymph nodes, and can pose a significant therapeutic challenge, as shown in Image 1 (Pawlik et al. 2005). Locoregionally advanced melanoma has also been shown to have significant adverse effects on patient\u2019s quality of life and emotional well-being (Weitman et al. 2018).",

As a result of this prolonged survival, patients are living longer with advanced disease and therefore the importance of locoregional control has also increased. Fortunately, multiple management modalities exist for patients with advanced locoregional disease. This chapter focuses on the regional perfusion procedures, hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion (HILP) and isolated limb infusion (ILI), intralesional therapies, and neoadjuvant systemic therapy strategies for borderline resectable nodal metastases.",

Contemporary studies define this as regrowth within 2 cm of the surgical scar (Balch et al. 1993). This can be a result of either incomplete excision of the primary tumor or intralymphatic metastases and microscopic satellite lesions which are not contiguous but rather within the immediate area of the primary lesion. It is worth noting that although commonly used, a definition involving distance from the primary excision scar can lead to inconsistencies since primary resection margins vary between 1 and 2 cm, depending on the depth of the primary tumor.",

            "text": "Several features of the primary tumor and lymphatic metastases have been examined as potential prognostic factors that may be predictive of melanoma local recurrence. Long-term results of the Intergroup Melanoma Trial designed to evaluate 2 cm versus 4 cm surgical margins demonstrated a higher risk for local recurrence in patients with thicker primary melanomas (Karakousis et al. 1996; Balch et al. 2001). The risk of melanoma local recurrence increased with tumor thickness, despite the wider margins employed as tumor thickness increased (Table 1). The presence of ulceration in the primary melanoma is also an important risk factor for local recurrence, as evidenced by results of the Intergroup Melanoma Trial, as the presence or absence of ulceration had the greatest impact on risk for local recurrence (Balch et al. 2001). In the randomized group of patients with lesions on the trunk and proximal extremity, there was a sixfold increase in local recurrence rates (at any time) in patients with ulcerated primary melanomas, with local recurrence rates of 6.6% in patients with ulcerated primary melanomas compared with 1.1% in patients with nonulcerated primary lesions. In the nonrandomized group with lesions involving the distal extremity and head and neck sites, the local recurrence rate was 16.2% (at any time) in patients with ulcerated lesions compared to 2.1% in patients with nonulcerated lesions (p < 0.001) (Balch et al. 2001). Resection margin size has not been shown to correlate with local recurrence as several prospective multi-institutional and large retrospective studies have shown that narrow margins for resection of thin melanomas result in similar rates of local recurrence. Furthermore, for tumors between 1 and 2 mm thick, a recent large retrospective study showed no significant difference in local recurrence or survival with 1 cm resection margins when compared to 2 cm margins (Doepker et al. 2016).",

In patients who are examined at regular intervals, local recurrences are may be detected at a stage at which they can be managed by surgical resection. Few data exist on appropriate surgical margins to employ during resection of a local recurrence. In the absence of significant data, most experts recommend excision using approximately 1 cm margins to ensure that a grossly clear margin is achieved. Clearly, radical surgery that makes use of extensive margins during surgical extirpation of a local recurrence is not justified. But even when more conservative margins are employed to excise a local recurrence, skin grafts are frequently required to close the resulting defect in an operative field that has already been compromised by a prior wide excision.",

            "text": "The incidence of regional nodal recurrence after lymphadenectomy is variable and depends on a number of factors, primarily related to the tumor burden in the lymph node basin originally dissected. To a lesser extent, the likelihood of regional nodal recurrence depends on the extent of the procedure performed. Miller et al. found a 12% rate of nodal relapse at the site of 207 patients who underwent prior lymphadenectomy and noted relapse in a regional nodal basin after removal of negative nodes in 6.7% of patients. When one to three nodes were positive, 14% of patients subsequently suffered a relapse in the regional nodal basin; when more than four nodes were positive at the initial dissection, 53% of patients subsequently had a relapse in the regional nodal basin (Miller et al. 1992). Warso and Das Gupta found a 5.6% rate of nodal recurrence among 1030 patients undergoing prior lymphadenectomy (Warso and Das Gupta 1994). Regional nodal failure was often a harbinger of systemic relapse, because fewer than half of those patients had recurrences confined to the nodes alone. Calabro et al. reported 162 nodal relapses among 1001 patients undergoing lymphadenectomy with positive nodes (16%). Factors that predicted nodal basin relapse included the number of positive lymph nodes and the presence of extranodal tumor extension (Calabro et al. 1989). Of note, factors that did not predict nodal recurrence in that series included a history of prior lymph node biopsy, the clinical status of the nodes, or the site of regional lymphadenectomy. The highest reported rate of regional nodal recurrence after lymphadenectomy was from a series by Monsour et al. Of 48 patients undergoing therapeutic lymphadenectomy, 52% developed regional nodal recurrence as their initial site of failure. In that review, nodal relapse was age dependent as 31% in patients less than 50 years old and 66% in patients more than 50 years of age recurred. The authors did not comment on the factors that may have predisposed their patients to such a high rate of regional nodal recurrence (Monsour et al. 1993).",

Locoregional recurrences constituted 61% of all first-site recurrences, and distant recurrences accounted for 39%. As in Gershenwald\u2019s study, a re-examination of a sentinel node initially thought to be negative in 11 patients who had subsequent nodal recurrence detected metastatic disease in seven (64%).

For perfusion of lung tumors, use of two circuits and caval occlusion were used to prevent mixing between the systemic and pulmonic circuits.

Unfortunately, an opportunity for progress was lost during this interval because this experience lacked scientific rigor. The studies were generally single arm, absent appropriate control groups, and involved heterogenous patient populations including patients with completely resected tumors and unresectable tumors. Treatment schedules were varied in their dose of melphalan, perfusion duration, and perfusion temperature (Rosin and Westbury 1980; Di Filippo et al. 1989; Jonsson et al. 1983; Lejeune et al. 1983; Skene et al. 1990; Minor et al. 1985; Kroon 1988; Klaase et al. 1994a; Kroon et al. 1993). For example, in a report of 1139 perfusions performed over 35 years, the authors included patients in need of definitive treatment of in-transit metastases, unresectable recurrent or primary tumors, adjunctive therapy to surgical excision for regionally confined melanoma, conversion of advanced unresectable melanoma to resectable, and palliation in noncurable recurrent melanomas by maintaining a functional limb in the presence of systemic metastases (Krementz et al. 1994). However, clinical studies in the past two decades have been of significantly higher quality and with greater scientific rigor. Results of these studies are discussed below.

The melanoma should be considered unresectable, although the definition of unresectable is subjective. The most common indication for limb perfusion is in-transit metastases, and the frequency and timing of in-transit metastases as well as the number and distribution of metastases are used to define when resection is appropriate. Rapid recurrence of multiple in tumor nodules soon after excision of in-transit metastases indicates that further surgical resection is not warranted. Full staging including PET-CT and head MRI to exclude other metastases should be performed. Patients with peripheral vascular disease are not good candidates for HILP because of a significantly higher risk for toxicity and complications.

Prior to effective molecularly targeted immunotherapies, HILP was accepted as the most effective and appropriate treatment for patients with metastases or local recurrence confined to an extremity. However, with advent of effective systemic therapies, most patients are treated with systemic therapy before resorting to HILP. BRAF V600 mutant melanomas are commonly sensitive to targeted therapy using a BRAF inhibitor combined with a MEK inhibitor, with a response rate of 63% and acceptable toxicity (Flaherty et al. 2012a, b). And for patients without BRAF V600 mutations in their melanoma, immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy to block CTLA-4, PD1, or PDL1 is commonly used. Response rates range from 11% with Ipilimumab to 61% with Ipilimumab and nivolumab (Wolchok et al. 2017). Combined BRAF and MEK inhibitor therapy is typically first-line treatment for unresectable in-transit metastases that are BRAF mutant. And immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy is typically first-line treatment for unresectable in-transit metastases that are wild type. HILP is considered for patients who progress on these therapies. And it is a good approach for patients who have a contraindication to immunotherapy, such as liver transplant, active colitis, and/or unmanageable and severe toxicity to immunotherapy.",

A prospective randomized control trial was conducted at the University of Cologne randomized to excision alone or excision with HILP. This trial was stopped early because interim analysis showed a remarkable reduction in recurrences in the HILP arm (Ghussen et al. 1988). But subsequently conducted randomize control trials that are of higher quality and larger patient number have convincingly demonstrated lack of benefit of adjuvant HILP. Thus, the results of the Cologne study \u2013 positive and in favor of HILP \u2013 are generally discounted and considered an unreliable outlier based on its very small sample size (e.g., 34 patients treated with HILP). The clinical trial considered definitive in this area was conducted by a consortium of EORTC, WHO, and the North American Perfusion Group (NAPG-1) (Koops et al. 1998). Over a period of 10 years, 852 patients were randomized to wide excision alone or wide excision and HILP. HILP-treated patients benefitted from a reduction in incidence of in-transit metastases as first site of recurrence (reduced from 6.6% to 3.3%), and of regional lymph node metastases, with a reduction from 16.7% to 12.6%. But importantly, HILP-treated patients experienced no benefit in overall survival or time to distant metastasis. Adjuvant HILP was also examined as adjuvant to excision of in-transit metastases, and similar to other adjuvant trial results, improvement in regional disease control could be demonstrated but not improvement in overall survival (Hafstrom et al. 1991). In summary, HILP is not beneficial as an adjuvant therapy. ",

Measurement of any preexisting leg edema to establish a baseline is appropriate. Careful evaluation for regional nodal metastases by CT or PET-CT establishes whether elective concomitant lymphadenectomy is required. In cases where the presence of significant peripheral vascular disease is detected on clinical examination, pulse volume recordings (PVR) are a useful noninvasive evaluation to determine the locations and severity of disease, and to establish a baseline. Patients with moderate or severe peripheral vascular disease are at high risk for complications from isolated limb perfusion and require alternative approaches for management of their melanoma.

Axillary lymphadenectomy and iliac/hypogastric lymphadenectomy are performed as a matter of routine during isolated limb perfusion through the axillary or external iliac vessels, respectively. However, superficial femoral lymphadenectomy is performed at time of isolated limb perfusion only when clinical evidence of nodal metastases is present given that the incision used for this lymphadenectomy has high likelihood of infection or dehiscence, especially in a chemotherapy-treated field. Moreover, perfusion from an iliac approach does effectively treat nodes in the femoral triangle (Koops et al. 1998). The vessels are circumferentially isolated and small collateral vessels distal to the cannulation sites are tied off. A Steinmann pin is placed into the anterior superior iliac spine to serve as a cleat and prevent slippage of the tourniquet around the root of the extremity. Once the dissection is complete, 350 U/kg heparin is administered to achieve an ACT of over 450 sec. The vessels are occluded proximally and distally with either vascular clamps or Rummel tourniquets. The vein and artery are cannulated through transversely oriented incisions in the vessels, and each held in place with a Rummel tourniquet placed around the distal vessel and cannula, taking care to avoid fracturing any atherosclerotic plaque that is present. The tourniquet around the root of the limb is tightened maximally. After confirmation of a therapeutic ACT (typically >450 s), the cannulas are connected to the extracorporeal circuit and the roller pump is gradually brought up to the maximum flow rate at which the reservoir volume does not diminish. In rare patients, typically those that start with a very low hematocrit that also have very small limb volumes and consequently larger hemodilution from the priming volume, the hematocrit in the circuit is unacceptably low (e.g., below 18%). In these cases, a portion of a unit of packed red blood cells is transfused into the circuit. Heparin resistance \u2013 defined by the inability to achieve therapeutic ACT with typical heparin doses \u2013 is typically successfully treated with additional heparin. However, anti-thrombin III deficiency should be suspected if this maneuver is unsuccessful. In these situations, options include changing to argatroban, or transfusion of fresh frozen plasma or antithrombin (Spiess 2008).",

The former condition leads to systemic exposure to the drug, and the latter condition leads to lowering of the drug concentration in the perfusion circuit. One commonly used technique to measure leak involves mounting a shielded precordial scintillation detector over the precordium and injecting isotope labelled albumin or red cells into the perfusion circuit. I-131 and Tm-99 are used most commonly. A fraction of the total dose is administered into the systemic circulation to calibrate the system and allow for quantification of the leak, using the assumption that the volumes of the extracorporeal circuit and the systemic vasculature are in the proportion of 1:5. This technique allows determination of the percent fractional leak as a function of time. An alternative approach involves administration of fluorescein into the circuit and then viewing different areas of the body and collected urine with a Woods lamp. This technique can reveal specific spots of skin outside the extremity that are receiving perfusate, and lead to identification of specific collateral vessels to be tied off. Fluorescein in the urine collection chamber is easily identified with the black light, and increase in intensity over time provides a qualitative sense of the rate of leak. A disadvantage of this technique is that quantification is not possible, and once a significant systemic leak has occurred, it is not possible to confirm correction of the leak. Another technique that has been described but not used widely is administration of 3% desflurane into the bypass circuit using an anesthetic vaporizer. The expired breath is then monitored by standard gas analysis for desflurane as a sign of leakage (Stanley et al. 2000).",

The operating table can be tilted into reverse Tredelenberg position to lower the venous pressure in the leg relative to the IVC. After infusion of fluorescein into the circuit, the skin should be examined with a Woods lamp to search for specific collateral vessels that were missed on initial dissection and can be tied off (e.g., inferior epigastric or circumflex iliac vessels).

The mechanism of action of melphalan is through its ability to interact directly with DNA and cause miscoding. A second mechanism by which alkylating agents cause DNA damage is by formation of cross-bridges in the DNA, thereby preventing strand replication or transcription.",

Pharmacokinetic studies in HILP demonstrate rapid uptake in tissue in the first 5\u201310 min, and continual reduction in drug concentration over 60 min to 10\u201320% of the starting concentration (Scott et al. 1992). Ideal dosing is calculated from limb volume rather than body weight. Limb volume expressed as a percentage of total body weight produced as much as a twofold variation in the population for both lower and upper extremities. This could lead to double the amount of melphalan administered to the same volume of tissue in two different individuals when dosed by weight. When dosed by limb volume, optimal dosages of 10 mg/L limb volume in the leg and 13 mg/L limb volume in the arm have been determined as the highest dose with acceptable risk, and little variation in toxicity (Kroon 1988; Benckhuijsen et al. 1988; Wieberdink et al. 1982). Melphalan is stable in sterile 0.9% sodium chloride for only 90 min at room temperature (Desmaris et al. 2015). Therefore, for an HILP procedure it should be prepared immediately before administration. Melphalan is eliminated from plasma primarily by chemical hydrolysis to inactive monohydroxymelphalan and dihydroxymelphalan. Renal excretion is extremely low. Identification of fluorescein in the urine from a leak test does not equate to a similar amount of melphalan in the urine. Nonetheless, all discarded bodily fluids from an HILP case should be handled as chemotherapy biohazard waste. Side effects of melphalan administration as part of HILP are discussed below. ",

For these reasons there has been great interest in its potential as an anti-cancer agent. However, humans are exquisitely sensitive to toxic effects of TNF\u03b1 including a septic-like response with fevers, tachycardia, cardiovascular collapse, pulmonary edema and shock. The maximum tolerated systemic dose has no effect on tumors. TNF\u03b1 therefore is a logical choice of agent for isolated regional perfusion with a goal of achieving anti-tumor effects in the extremity without systemic side effects. TNF\u03b1 alone has been used for isolated limb perfusion, with limited benefit observed (Posner et al. 1995). Of six treated patients, partial response of less than 1 month\u2019s duration was seen in two patients and one patient had a complete response of only 7 months\u2019 duration and then progressed. The observation that TNF\u03b1 increases tumor neovascular permeability suggests that its best use is in combination with other agents. It has been combined most commonly with melphalan and interferon-\u03b3. Other agents used in the past for isolated limb perfusion either alone or in combination with other agents include cisplatin, dacarbazine, actinomycin D, and fotemusine (Sanki et al. 2007). ",

Investigators subsequently observed that combined regional chemotherapy with mild hyperthermia produced higher response rates (Stehlin et al. 1975). There are no prospective randomized clinical trial results comparing isolated limb perfusion with versus without hyperthermia to inform this strategic decision. Hyperthermia during HILP affects tumor cells, other cell populations within the tumors including neovasculature and stromal cells, and normal tissues in the extremity. The addition of hyperthermia clearly increases side effects (e.g., effects on normal tissues). In one study, factors associated with a greater toxicity were tissue temperatures 40 \u00b0C or higher, female gender, low pH in the circuit, and perfusion at a proximal level of isolation (Klaase et al. 1994c). However, it is equally clear that tumor cells are more susceptible to adverse effects of hyperthermia compared to normal cells. Results of animal model studies of isolated limb perfusion with versus without hyperthermia suggest added cytotoxicity and increased efficacy with the addition of the hyperthermia (Abdel-Wahab et al. 2004). These studies implicated a mechanism of enhanced cytotoxicity of l-phenylalanine mustard with hyperthermia rather than improved drug delivery and uptake. ",

However, interpretation of these data are complicated by the observation that treatment schedules varied in many ways beyond temperature, including differences in number of perfusions. Most of the patients receiving normothermic perfusion received a double perfusion, and double perfusions were associated with a higher response rate than single perfusions (Klaase et al. 1994a). Other factors associated with a higher response rate in this study were negative regional lymph nodes and leg as the site of disease rather than the arm or foot. A separate study of 216 patients treated between 1978 and 1990 reported that prognostic factors for survival in order of significance were stage of disease, gender, age, Breslow thickness, Clark level of infiltration of the primary melanoma and the number of metastases (Klaase et al. 1994b). In a similar analysis from Tulane University on 174 patients treated with limb perfusion between 1957 and 1982 \u2013 some in the adjuvant setting \u2013 the factors associated with decreased survival rates in patients that also underwent elective lymph node dissection were increasing age, presence of subcutaneous or both subcutaneous and dermal metastases, treatment at normothermic temperatures or earlier date of treatment (Sutherland et al. 1987).",

The difference was statistically significant, even though the response-rate observed with melphalan alone was higher than typically observed. At the same time as this trial, Fraker and colleagues at the NCI conducted a trial in which the TNF\u03b1 dose was escalated in combination with the standard melphalan and IFN\u03b3 doses (Fraker et al. 1996). The complete response rate in the 26 patients that received 4-mg TNF\u03b1 was 76%, with an overall objective response rate of 92%. The complete response rate in the 12 patients that received 6 mg TNF\u03b1 was 36% with an overall objective response rate of 100%. In the TNF\u03b1 6 mg group, regional toxicity was dose-limiting and greater in the group that received TNF\u03b1 4 mg, particularly skin blistering, painful myopathy and neuropathy. Based on these data the investigators concluded that HILP with TNF\u03b1 at 4 mg combined with IFN and melphalan was considerably less toxic than TNF\u03b1 at 6 mg, yet can lead to complete local responses in the majority of patients.",

Patients with in-transit metastases were randomized to melanoma combined with TNF\u03b1 or melphalan alone (Cornett et al. 2006b). HILP was completed in 124 patients of the 133 enrolled. Greater toxicity was observed in the TNF\u03b1 patients. Grade 4 adverse events were observed in 3 of 64 (4%) patients in the melphalan-alone arm compared to 11 of 65 (16%) patients in the melphalan-plus-TNF-alpha arm (p = 0.04). The complete response rate at 3 months was 25% in the melphalan-alone arm and 26% in the melphalan-TNF\u03b1 arm. The complete response rate at 6 months was higher in patients treated with the TNF\u03b1-containing regimen (42%) compared to the melphalan-alone regimen (20%), although this difference did not reach statistical significance.

An atherosclerotic plaque that is cracked during the operation or creation of an intimal flap may result in vascular compromise post-operatively. Unilateral loss of pulses, cool extremity, or evidence of reduced perfusion should be investigated immediately with non-invasive studies (PVR, Doppler) and angiography or CT angiography. Immediate repair of compromised inflow is indicated. And following restoration of blood flow, careful monitoring for compartment syndrome should be performed by pressure measurements. A two-incision, four-compartment fasciotomy is performed if indicated. Evidence for rhabdomyolysis should be sought by monitoring muscle tenderness, serum CK, and urine myoglobin.

Presently, ILI is used throughout the world and has shown favorable response rates for locally-advanced and in-transit melanoma (Kroon et al. 2014, 2016; Muilenburg et al. 2015; Li et al. 2018) .",

Limb temperatures are maintained greater than 37 \u00b0C and usually closer to 40 \u00b0C by a combination of liquid warming blankets on the affected extremity and overhead heaters which are institution-specific. The infusion portion of the procedure is then performed in the operating room under general anesthesia. Prior to inflating the tourniquet, patients are fully heparinized to achieve an activated clotting time (ACT) greater than 350 or 400 sec, depending on the institution. The tourniquet is inflated once adequate circulation is achieved by manually drawing blood from the venous catheter and reinjecting it into the arterial catheter with a 20 cc syringe. After tourniquet inflation, papaverine is routinely administered through the arterial catheter to maximize vasodilation. Isolation of the limb is checked by confirming cessation of flow in pedal or radial arteries by a Doppler probe. Limb volume measurements are used to determine the dose of chemotherapeutic agents, usually melphalan with or without actinomycin-D, and melphalan dosing is corrected for ideal body weight. Infusion lasts for typically 30 minutes and the chemotherapeutic agent is manually circulated with a syringe connected in line to the closed circuit with a heating source. Following infusion of chemotherapy, the limb is washed out with Hartmann\u2019s or saline solution until the effluent is clear, and protamine is administered to reverse heparinization after the tourniquet is released.",

More severe reactions such as erythema nodosum, hepatic dysfunction, hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylaxis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation have also been reported (Bast et al. 1974). In addition, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group randomized trial E1673, in which patients with stage I-\u2013III melanoma were randomized to either intralesional BCG versus observation demonstrated no significant difference in disease-free or overall survival (Agarwala et al. 2004). Due to the concerns about serious adverse effects and the lack of benefit seen in a randomized trial, use of intralesional BCG has fallen out of favor. ",

IL-2 is a cytokine that stimulates IL-2 receptors resulting in boosting of the natural killer compartment, augmentation of the cytotoxicity of monocytes, induction of T-helper function, and increase in reactivity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Meloni et al. 1992). Intravenous infusion of IL-2 was shown to induce regression in 20\u201335% of patients with a variety of metastatic cancers including melanoma (Rosenberg et al. 1989). A systematic review of 270 patients from eight clinical trials conducted between 1985 and 1993 demonstrated an overall response rate of 16% in patients with metastatic melanoma with a complete response rate of 6% (Atkins et al. 1999). The US Food and Drug Administration approved use of systemic high-dose IL-2 for the treatment of advanced melanoma in 1998. However, there were considerable toxicities with this treatment leading to limited clinical use (Buchbinder and McDermott 2014).",

Meanwhile other agents such as T-VEC have demonstrated efficacy in large randomized studies and gained FDA approval and wide-spread use. PV-10, Daromun, and Coxsackievirus A21, and electrochemotherapy are still under investigation but have shown promising results thus far. Finally, perhaps the most promising results of all have been with the combination of intralesional therapies and systemic immunotherapies in which a synergistic effect appears to be observed and could potentially be used both in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting. The recent flurry of research on intralesional therapies for melanoma have made this an exciting treatment modality for patients with advanced melanoma. ",

First of all, provides an opportunity to decrease the size of the tumor and make a surgical resection more feasible. The pathology of the tumor also provides a biological window into the mechanism of response and/or resistance to treatment which can also facilitate the development of biomarkers. Neoadjuvant treatment offers the opportunity to select out the patients most likely to respond to treatment, or better tumor biology. However, an alternative argument is that the patients who fail neoadjuvant therapy have lost the opportunity regional control through surgical resection. Therefore, it is important to understand the response rate and time to response prior to embarking on neoadjuvant treatment. Several issues in neoadjuvant treatment however, remain unclear. For example, the optimal time of neoadjuvant treatment prior to resection, whether the measurement of response based upon radiologic or pathologic response, and whether the response rate in the neoadjuvant setting supercedes therapy as an adjuvant.",

Amongst patients with measurable disease, an early trial of CVD given in 2\u20133 cycles followed by surgery and subsequent CVD if a response demonstrated a 48% response rate (Buzaid et al. 1994). This was followed by multiple trials which demonstrated efficacy of biochemotherapy, which includes CVD in combination with IL2 and interferon. Selected series demonstrated response rates of 39\u201350% (Buzaid et al. 1998; Gibbs et al. 2002). However, a phase II multicenter trial demonstrated a slightly lower response rate of 26% (22% partial and 4% complete) (Lewis et al. 2006). Overall, these response rates were not higher than the 48% response rate demonstrated in a Phase III trial of patients with metastatic melanoma, which unfortunately did not improve survival (Eton et al. 2002). Single agent temodar was also studied in a neoadjuvant trial of resectable Stage III, IVa disease. The overall response rate of 16% with two patients that had a complete response(CR), but this was not different than responses noted in Stage IV disease (Shah et al. 2010). Interferon-\u03b12b (IFN) was also studied in a neoadjuvant/adjuvant fashion in patients with Stage III disease and palpable nodes. Patients underwent 4 weeks of treatment prior to surgery, followed by maintenance for a total of 1 year of treatment, with an impressive clinical response rate 55%, and three patients with a pathological CR (Moschos et al. 2006).",

            "text": "The studies above validated the feasibility of neoadjuvant trials, but unfortunately did not improve survival. However, subsequently the landscape of the treatment of melanoma changed with effective systemic therapies. The first drug to improve overall survival in patients with metastatic melanoma was anti-CTLA-4, or Ipilimumab. The response rate was 10% with a similar improvement in survival over standard therapy alone, vaccination with gp100 or dacarbazine (Hodi et al. 2010; Robert et al. 2011). Subsequently, anti-PD1 therapy has demonstrated a response rate of 30% and the combination of CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockade increases responses to 58% (Topalian et al. 2012; Wolchok et al. 2017). With active drug combinations, there was rationale to use these drugs in the neoadjuvant setting.",

            "text": "Tarhini et al. looked at the role of neoadjuvant Ipilimumab in patients with Stage IIIB/C melanoma. Patients had a radiologic assessment, pretreatment biopsy, and then received Ipilimumab for two doses, followed by repeat radiologic assessment and surgery. Of the 33 evaluable patients, all had viable melanoma on the pathologic analysis. Investigation of the tumor demonstrated immune activation with CD4 and CD8 cells after treatment, and a low baseline CD20 cell number trended with a poor clinical response. On imaging, 9% had a partial response, 64% had stable disease, and 24% patients has progressive disease (Tarhini et al. 2014). Importantly, no patients lost the opportunity to have surgery, but the response rate was similar to that seen in Stage IV disease, and therefore subsequent trials have also employed anti-PD1 therapy. Early report of the Optimal Neoadjuvant Combination (OpACIN) trial of combination of Ipilimumab and nivolimab(IPI NIVO) demonstrated responses in 8 of 10 patients in the phase Ib portion of the trial. This trial is now being expanded to additional patients, but also noted many patients did not complete treatment because of toxicity (Rozeman et al. 2017). There are currently open trials of neoadjuvant therapy and the early results were pooled and presented in abstract form of the International Neoadjuvant Melanoma Consortium (INMC). Of the combined 21 patients receiving immunotherapy with IPI NIVO or NIVO alone, a pathologic complete response was found in 8 patients (38%), none of which have had a recurrence (Menzies et al. 2017). Further analysis of genomics of responding and non-responding patients is ongoing.",

            "text": "Targeted inhibition of BRAF mutated tumors has been the other area of major advance in melanoma. While single agent BRAF inhibition improved survival, resistance developed in many within a year (Chapman et al. 2011). Combination BRAF/MEK has been shown to improve survival in Stage IV patients beyond single agent and is now the preferred drug combination (Flaherty et al. 2012b). Studies utilizing a neoadjuvant approach with targeted therapy have also shown promise. A prospective trial randomized patients in a 2:1 fashion to neoadjuvant BRAF/MEK inhibition for 12 weeks followed by surgery and up to 44 weeks of postop treatment, for a total of 52 weeks. After 18 months of follow-up the trial was stopped because 10 of 14 patients in the treatment arm (71%) remained free of disease while none (0 of 7 patients) in the standard of care arm remained free of disease. The radiologic response rate in this cohort was 85%, and of the 12 patients that went on to have surgery, the pathological CR rate was 58% (Amaria et al. 2018). The toxicity was acceptable and similar to that seen in patients with Stage IV disease, the majority being fevers, chills and headache. Interestingly, a pretreatment biopsy demonstrating less pERK expression, and increased CD8 toxicity was associated with a CR. The trial was not powered to detect survival differences, and has remained open as a phase II single arm trial. However, the results are consistent with a larger experience of the international neoadjuvant melanoma consortium, which included patients from this trial, with a pathologic complete response rate of 55% (Menzies et al. 2017). All of these neoadjuvant targeted therapy trials administer targeted BRAF/MEK preoperatively and postoperatively for a year, and therefore do not answer the question of whether neoadjuvant therapy alone would be sufficient. However, the progression free survival (PFS) of targeted therapy in the adjuvant setting is 58% for combination therapy and 39% for placebo, so the benefit of the combination neoadjuvant plus adjuvant approach appear to be improved in these early studies.",

            "text": "While the results of neoadjuvant studies in the era of effective systemic therapies are still being finalized, the data to date demonstrates several important points. Responses to treatment occur within 6\u201312 weeks and no trial to date has reported the loss of control of a regional nodal basin by administering neoadjuvant therapy. Therefore, neoadjuvant therapy remains a safe option for patients with borderline resectable disease. The response rate to 12 weeks of targeted therapy with BRAF and MEK inhibition, 85%, with a CR rate of over 50% at surgery, is the highest noted to date, and better tolerated. The early reports of combination Ipilimumab and nivolimab are also encouraging, with responses from 80% after 6 weeks of treatment, and a CR rate at surgery of 38%. However, combination immunotherapy data is not as mature, and treatment is associated with more toxicity and this risk must be weighed on an individual basis. It will be interesting to see if the high response rates seen in early combination trials persist in larger cohorts. Also, future studies will look at whether surgery can be delayed in responding patients to the point of maximal response. In general, for a patient with borderline resectable disease and a BRAF mutation, neoadjuvant therapy has the highest tolerability and chance of success. Hopefully the results of these trials will elucidate the patients who are most likely to benefit from the neoadjuvant approach in the future. ",
