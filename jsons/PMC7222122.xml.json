Thus, it is anticipated that in the future greater numbers of elderly patients will require aortic valve replacement (AVR).

Overall survival was estimated by the Kaplan\u2013Meier method and expressed as percentage. The difference between the survival curves was assessed using log-rank test. To identify independent predictors of late mortality, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were constructed. Covariates included in the model were determined a priori and included all the preoperative variables. A significance level of p < 0.25 was used to enter variables in the Cox regression analysis. Due to differences in underlying patient characteristics, propensity matching of iAVR with AVR + CABG patients was employed. A propensity score (PS) was calculated and the resulting PS for each patient represented the probability of being in the iAVR or in the AVR + CABG group. Pretreatment variables were compared using the standardized mean difference (SMD) and a high quality of the matching was considered when the covariate balance between the groups showed an SMD less than 10%. To neutralize the adverse effect of coronary artery disease, this covariate was not entered in the multivariable logistic regression model. Survival was compared for propensity-matched patients using the stratified log-rank test. All p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

            "text": "TAVI has been dramatically increased during the last decade [7] and, recently, indication of TAVI has expanded to nonagenarians [33] and even to intermediate-risk patients [34]. In a recent meta-analysis, Biancari et al. [33] reported a 30-day mortality of 7.1% and an excellent mid-term survival of 61.3% at 3 years in a pool of 1227 nonagenarians who underwent TAVI, while Thourani et al. [34] reported a 30-day mortality of 1.1% and low incidence of mortality, stroke and aortic regurgitation at 1 year in a population of 1077 intermediate-risk patients. TAVI is now considered the first treatment of choice for high-risk and elderly patients. However, patients with TAVI indications need to be carefully selected because of some anatomical reasons, such as low take-off of coronary ostia, aggressive peripheral arteriopathy and left ventricular obstruction or calcification, which may severely compromise the immediate results. Moreover, the valve-in-valve option has considerable limitations in patients with small bioprosthetic valve and is not indicated in patients with a mechanical valve [35]. Compared with TAVI, the surgical approach has the advantage of removing the calcified native valve, making a careful debridement of the aortic annulus and sizing appropriately the prosthesis valve. These factors may contribute to reducing the risk of paravalvular leak, PPM and requirement of permanent pacemaker. A controversial topic concerns the short and mid-term results of those patients who underwent TAVI + PCI compared to patients undergoing CABG + AVR. Despite that isolated TAVI proved firstly to have better results in those patients without previous CABG compared to patients with previous CABG [36] and secondly to be superior compared to patients who underwent TAVI + PCI [37], the evidence of a superiority of the TAVI + PCI compared to CABG + AVR is still very controversial and few studies have investigated it so far. Wendt et al. [38] reported comparable results in high-risk patients undergoing either TAVI + PCI or AVR + CABG showing a 30-day mortality rate of 11.9% vs 12.5% (p = 0.89), respectively, and a 4-year survival of 53% and by 60.7% (p = 0.191), respectively. Similar results have recently been reported by Barbanti et al. [39] in a retrospective study of intermediate-risk population. A more recent prospective randomized study (SURTAVI trial) [40] showed acceptable and comparable results among intermediate-risk patients who underwent either TAVI + PCI or CABG + AVR in terms of all-cause mortality and disabling stroke at 2 years (16%, vs 14%, p = 0.69, respectively).",
