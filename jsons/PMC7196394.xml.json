Nasopharyngeal samples were tested with the assay developed by the CDC [3], and based on the World Health Organization standard. All the samples were refrigerated and shipped to Rabin Medical Center, where RNA extraction, RT-PCR, and the virus isolation and titration procedures were performed. Envelope protein gene (E), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (RdRP), and nucleocapsid (N) gene were measured by the RT-PCR (AllplexTM 2019-nCoV) [4,5]. If one target was detected, the assay was reported as positive. Recovery was defined as two negative measurements for all three genes. Here we describe the days to recovery from the first day of appearance of symptoms. Local ethical board approval and informed consent for analyzing routine procedures during the outbreak was waved at the time by the Director-General of the Israel Ministry of Health.",

Thirteen (65%) had a body temperature above 38\u00b0C at admission, 6 (30%) had hypertension, 3 (15%) type 2 diabetes, 9 (45%) dyslipidemia, and three were current smokers. Only one patient was treated by chloroquine, zinc, and azithromycin during hospitalization. The mean time to discharge was 17 days, the range was 13-21 days. The mean length of hospital stay was longer for patients who presented with a body temperature above 38\u00b0C during hospitalization (n=13) than for those who did not have an elevated body temperature (17\u20225 vs. 16\u20227 days p=0.6). Accordingly, the number of days to negative detection of each gene was longer among those with an elevated body temperature than among those without (gene E, 15\u20225 vs. 15\u20223; gene N, 17\u20225 vs. 16\u20227; and gene RdRp, 15\u20228 vs. 15\u20226 p>0.05 for all). Stratifying our population by median age (above and below 44 years), the time to full recovery was shorter for the younger than the older patients: 17\u20220 vs. 17\u20223 days. The time to negative detection of each gene was also shorter among the younger than the older patients, for example 14\u20224 vs 16\u20227 days, p=0.08, for gene E.

Although older, the women exhibited a shorter time to recovery than did the men (16\u20227 vs. 17\u20225 days p=0.6). We further examined the time from admission until negative detection of each gene. Figure 1b shows the time to recovery in all three detected genes by hospitalization day, from the first day of symptoms. All genes E, RdRp and N correlated with the sum of days leading to discharge; the strongest correlation was for gene N (r=0.78, r=0.82. r=1.0, respectively, p<0.001 for all). The time to recovery was longer for patients with hypertension or lung disease. Compared to those without hypertension, for those with hypertension (n=6), the number of days to recovery was 18\u20225 vs. 16\u20226, p=0.13; and for each of the genes E, RdRp, and N: 17\u20228 vs. 14\u20224, p=0.03; 17\u20227 vs. 14\u20229, p=0.05; and 18\u20225 vs. 16\u20226, p=0.13, respectively. In patients with no chronic illnesses at the time of admission (n=11), negative detections of gene E and RdRP were after 14\u20225 and 14\u20229 days, respectively. This contrasts to 16\u20224 and 16\u20227 days, respectively, for those with comorbidities upon admission. Full recovery was determined in those without comorbidities after 17\u20220 days, when gene N was also not detected, and for those with comorbidities after 17\u20224 days.",
