Neonatologists typically observe infants for the completion of an \u201cevent-free\u201d period after the discontinuation of caffeine therapy as a prerequisite for discharge;[11] however, no consensus among clinicians currently exists in regards to what length of apnea-free period is adequate enough to determine safe discharge [12]. Notably, some infants are discharged home on caffeine as a means of achieving earlier hospital discharge [13, 14]. Neonatologists must weigh the risks of early caffeine discontinuation (need for restart of therapy, respiratory compromise, and need for escalation of support) with those of later caffeine discontinuation (possible prolonged hospital stay and increased costs) in order to discontinue caffeine at an optimal time [15].",

We divided the patient population into two groups: (1) infants who discontinued caffeine therapy before the last week of hospitalization; and (2) infants who discontinued caffeine within the last week of hospitalization. The last week of hospitalization was chosen as a comparison time point because of the long half-life of caffeine and previous recommendations to monitor infants for a period of 7 days free of apnea before discharge [12, 19]. We compared demographic and clinical characteristics between these groups. For the two groups, we evaluated and compared the PMA at first administration of caffeine, postnatal age at first administration of caffeine, PMA at discontinuation of caffeine, PMA at discharge from hospital, total duration of caffeine, and the presence of BPD at any gestational age. For infants who discontinued caffeine before the last week of hospitalization, we evaluated respiratory support at the time of caffeine discontinuation and the time between caffeine discontinuation and discharge. To compare the variable distribution across groups, we used Fisher\u2019s exact test or the chi-square test which where appropriate for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables. Among sites who discharged at least 50 infants throughout the study period, we also compared clinical characteristics (mean postmenstrual age at caffeine discontinuation, mean gestational age, percentage of infants on positive airway pressure, and the ventilator at time of caffeine discontinuation). All analyses were performed using STATA 15.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) and assumed a two-sided significance limit of \u03b1 = 0.05.",

As expected, PMA at time of caffeine initiation varied across sites, as different sites care for different gestational age populations, and caffeine is often initiated soon after birth. More surprisingly, PMA at the time of caffeine discontinuation ranged from 32 to 37 weeks across sites and did not appear to correlate with the mean gestational age at the site. Also, our study demonstrated a wide range among sites in the percentage of infants in whom caffeine was discontinued during the last week of hospitalization, varying from 0 to 50%, which indicates that there are evident practice differences in how long clinicians watch infants who are off caffeine prior to discharge. While we found that discontinuation of caffeine in the last week of hospitalization occurred more commonly in larger and less premature infants, 28% of infants who discontinued caffeine in the last week of hospitalization were <1000 g. In addition, the use of supplemental oxygen and positive airway pressure was common at the time caffeine was discontinued. Our data demonstrate that there is a need to better define when caffeine can be safely discontinued.",

The mechanism for this neuroprotective effect of caffeine has been thought to be a result of the earlier discontinuation of positive airway pressure in infants on caffeine therapy as compared with those that are not [9]. Although caffeine\u2019s neuroprotective benefits are evident, the short- and long-term effects of continued caffeine therapy on the central nervous system are not clearly understood. As a result, neonatologists face the challenge of determining how long to continue caffeine therapy in order to maximize these neuroprotective benefits, including its antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties [25].",

Currently, no consensus exists among physicians regarding what length of apnea-free period of time is adequate to determine a safe discharge after a significant event [12]. In addition, no national standardization exists for defining a clinically significant event [26, 27]. In 2016, the Committee on Fetus and Newborn 2016 recommended a trial off therapy after an apnea-free period of 5\u20137 days or 33\u201334 weeks\u2019 PMA, whichever came first, but did not address the length of time an infant should be observed off therapy prior to discharge [19]. Darnall et al. examined the duration of apnea-free period and found that monitoring patients for 7 days identified 75% of babies who will have apneic spells before discharge; furthermore, this study revealed that infants who have been apnea-free for at least 8 days were less likely to have an apnea event unless they have additional risk factors, including sepsis and surgery [12]. Discharge readiness of premature infants is usually determined by the demonstration of functional maturation and medical stability. Factors contributing to a clinician\u2019s decision to discontinue caffeine therapy include the degree of respiratory stability and symptoms suggestive of caffeine-induced toxicity. Physician discomfort, which arises from a lack of evidence from medical literature, may also contribute to the wide variation of practice in response to apnea or bradycardia events [15].",
