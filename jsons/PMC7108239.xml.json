A large repertoire of immunoglobulins (IG) (\u223c1012) and T cell receptors (TR) (\u223c1012) is generated by mechanisms such as the combinatorial diversity of the variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) genes, the N-diversity, and for IG, the somatic hypermutations 2, 3 The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotype influences individual immune responses against specific antigens. As of January 2009, 3304 alleles had been identified and deposited in the IMGT/HLA Database [4]. Since a fully heterogeneous individual may possess up to six different HLA class I alleles and an equal number of class II alleles, the theoretical number of HLA haplotypes is greater than 1012. Binding studies showed that HLA class I binding peptides and the core of class II binding peptides are predominantly nine amino acids long. Consequently, the number of potential nonameric peptide candidates easily exceeds 1011. The astronomically high diversity of the immune system components, and also the complexity of its regulatory pathways, demands new approaches for accelerating immunology research. An immunoinformatics strategy, which combines database design, mathematical modeling and high-performance computing, provides a highly parallel, rational solution and works effectively on a massive scale.",

The Allergen Nomenclature database of the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) (http://www.allergen.org) provides a centralized system to ensure uniformity and consistency of allergen designations [17]. As of January 2009, more than 779 allergens and isoallergens from over 150 different species that can induce IgE-mediated allergy (reactivity >5%) in humans are described. The Structural Database of Allergen Proteins (SDAP) [18] stores information of 887 allergenic proteins. The Food Allergy Research and Resource Program (FARRP) Protein AllergenOnline Database [19] contains 1251 sequences of known and putative allergens derived from scientific literature and public databases. Allergome [20] emphasizes the annotation of allergens that result in an IgE-mediated disease.

The B cell receptor (BCR)-binding site is primarily hydrophobic, consisting of six hypervariable loops of variable length and amino acid composition. B cell epitopes can be either continuous or discontinuous. Approximately 10% of B cell epitopes are contiguous, consisting of a linear stretch of amino acids along the polypeptide chain. Most B cell epitopes, though, are non-contiguous in nature, where distant residues are brought into spatial proximity by protein folding. It has been reported that not all residues within an epitope are functionally important for binding, and the specificity could be reduced or eliminated by single-site amino acid substitution. The astronomical combinatorial space of molecular interactions calls for the use of computational tools and mathematical models for systematic screening and analysis.",

One of the biggest challenges in this field is the lack of standards in defining B cell epitopes which has a direct impact on the selection and development of appropriate tools for analysis [33]. Current efforts are primarily focused on the design of predictors for continuous epitopes, in part, due to lower complexity in system development, and also because the experimental design of conformational epitopes is non-trivial. Propensity scales are commonly used to guide the mapping of B cell epitopes. Hopp and Woods [34] introduced the use of hydrophilicity scales for locating protein antigenic determinants. Pellequer et al.\n[35] applied the use of turn propensities for the analysis on 85 continuous epitopes in 14 proteins. Other amino acid propensities were also proposed, but the effectiveness of such an approach has, so far, been controversial. A benchmark on the performance of 484 amino acid propensity scales for B cell epitope prediction revealed that the best set of scales and parameters performed only slightly better than random [36]. Machine learning techniques have been applied, but also achieved limited success for predicting continuous epitopes [37]. On the contrary, structure-based predictors for B cell epitope mapping are gaining dominance, due to (1) the rapidly increasing number of three-dimensional (3D) structures of antibody\u2013antigen complexes available in the PDB and in IMGT/3Dstructure-DB, and (2) the ability to predict both continuous and discontinuous epitopes. In fact, the use of structural data parallels the noticeable shift in B cell epitope prediction methodologies over the past few years, away from sequence-derived properties to much more structure-guided designs [38].",

This approach allows the design of peptide vaccines with improved global coverage by ensuring that HLA alleles that are present in most individuals from all major ethnic groups may bind to at least one of the peptides in the vaccine. Tools for predicting MHC class I binding in higher vertebrates have also been reported [41]. Dynamic activities over the past 2 years have also seen at least six reports of algorithms that attempt to simulate the cell-mediated immune system by integrating the different sub-components of the antigen processing and presentation pathway such as TAP, proteasome, and MHC 42, 43.

Standards for assessing protein allergenicity are still in their formative stages. The World Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) proposed guidelines for evaluating allergenicity of genetically modified foods. According to the Codex alimentarius, a protein is potentially allergenic if it possesses an identity of \u22656 contiguous amino acids or \u226535% sequence similarity over an 80 amino acid window with a known allergen. Although these recommendations are in place, their inherent limitations are starting to become apparent and exceptions to the rules have been well reported [44]. Computational algorithms have been actively developed to help assess the allergenic potential of genetically modified food crops, bio-pharmaceuticals and various other products on the consumer market [45]. An example was the use of the FASTA3 algorithm with k-nearest-neighbour (kNN) classifier for assessing potential food allergenicity of newly introduced proteins [46]. The use of Fourier transform to detect compact patterns in allergens was also reported [44]. Implementation and controlled comparisons of allergen prediction systems is difficult, however, due to poorly defined standards for identifying allergenicity and the lack of experimental non-allergenic sequences. Many new allergen prediction systems use hypothetical or inferred non-allergenic sequences for system training and testing. At present, information is limited about the usefulness of much of these systems, and significant costs may be incurred in implementing, improving and managing these systems, as well as investigating false alarms. As more experimental validations are performed, the relative value of the different approaches will be known and it should be expected that the current FAO/WHO recommendations will also be refined.",

On the other hand, cellular automata have also been proposed for exploring a wide range of virus\u2013host relations [30]. The different bioinformatic and mathematical modeling approaches, in combination with advances in computational infrastructures, allow the construction of new models that are orders of magnitudes more complex than those currently available and facilitate a system-level understanding of the structure and dynamics of cellular and organism functions. Already, a number of \u2018system biology\u2019 approaches for immunological studies, such as the EU funded ImmunoGrid project [59] and the National Cancer Institute's Integrative Cancer Biology Program [60] have been reported. With the increasing availability of correlative data and maturation of key technologies for systems biology, it should be expected that many more such system-driven approaches will be developed that could lead to improved understanding of development and homeostasis of immune system processes.",
