The diagnosis relies on a systematic assessment of these possible causes using the DIRECT approach (Chap. 2 in the diagnosis strategy). In our patient, the time from symptom onset to admission was 15 days, and the alteration in cellular immune deficiency associated with Hodgkin's disease suggested infection with intracellular bacteria. Radiographic findings before ICU admission were normal. Our patient had a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, and cardiogenic edema was therefore a possibility. He received bleomycin and was a smoker. Based on these features, the most likely diagnoses were infection (bacterial, viral, or parasitic), cardiogenic edema, and pulmonary toxicity [1] . Bleomycin toxicity has been evaluated in a study of patients with Hodgkin's disease [3] . Of 141 patients, 18% experienced bleomycin toxicity. The ABVD chemotherapy regimen, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, radiation therapy, and age older than 40 years were associated with bleomycin toxicity. Overall 5-year survival was 63% in the patients with bleomycin toxicity and 90% in the other patients (P = 0.001) [1] .",

A study has shown that postmortem examination supplied a previously unrecognized diagnosis in 4% of patients overall and in a higher proportion of immunocompromised patients [6, 7] . Also, a recent comprehensive review on rapid growing mycobacteria concluded that the approach to antimycobacterial drugs may be different for various patients with cancer [8] . We believe that similar data are needed in cancer patients with mycobacteria to recognize clinical vignettes highly suggestive of mycobacteria infections allowing early antimycobacterial therapy initiation in patients likely to receive a post-mortem diagnosis.",
