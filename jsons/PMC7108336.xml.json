            "text": "Viral upper respiratory tract infections (vURIs), which are extremely common, may be subclinical or cause a cold/flu-like illness (CFLI) (Rakes et al., 1999, Nokso-Koivisto et al., 2002, Harju et al., 2006). A CFLI is usually diagnosed by the presence of a set of symptoms and/or signs that are culturally accepted, but modified by past experiences. The known complications of a vURI include sinusitis, otitis media, bronchiolitis, asthma exacerbation and pneumonia (Wald et al., 1991, Alho et al., 2001, Greenberg, 2003, Heikkinen and Jarvinen, 2003, Fleming et al., 2005). Many studies focused on estimating the coincidence of these complications and vURIs for purposes of identifying individual factors that define levels of risk for a specific vURI (Doyle and Alper, 2003). Because vURIs without CFLIs are not apparent, coincidence estimates for vURI complications are usually calculated as events/CFLI episode, which introduces an ascertainment bias that underestimates the true frequency of a complication that is attributable to a vURI (Doyle et al., 1999, Winther et al., 2006, Winther et al., 2007, Doyle et al., 1994 #15). This study determined if that ascertainment bias is virus-specific by defining the relative frequencies of subclinical vURIs for the most common viruses causing vURIs. The hypothesis tested is that subclinical vURIs are rare and that their relative frequency is not different among viruses.",

Because there is no generally accepted criteria for assigning a CFLI in infants and children, CFLI presence/absence for each day was not based on predefined illness criteria, but rather on assignment for that day as determined by the caretaker. The initial plans were to collect secretion samples at regular intervals with supplemental sampling during CFLIs in the child or a family member but this was not possible for a variety of reasons. Consequently, a convenience sampling strategy was adopted that concentrated on CFLI periods, periods when the child's sib had a CFLI and other non-CFLI periods when acceptable to the children. For all years, the number of samples processed in each month from October through April was 149, 229, 219, 181, 211, 195 and 115 with some variability in the frequency of monthly samples among years.",

These viruses were sought using a protocol adapted from the Hexaplex procedure (Prodesse, Inc., Waukesha, WI) and previously described primers and probes (Winther et al., 2007). Reported sensitivities of the PCR assays were \u22641 tissue culture infectious dose50/0.1 ml for picornavirus, 0.01 TCID50/0.1 ml for coronavirus, 0.28 TCID50/280 \u03bcl for RSV and <1 TCID50/0.1 \u03bcl for adenovirus (Winther et al., 2007).

In that analysis, 26% of CFLIs were \u2212PCR and the current results approximate that value (i.e. 36%). Because we did not assay all viruses that can cause CFLIs (e.g. metapneumovirus, human bocavirus), procedural failures with our assay may have occurred, and the assay sensitivities depend on the unmeasured dilution of aspirated nasal secretions and may be virus-specific, a viral etiology cannot be ruled out for those episodes.
