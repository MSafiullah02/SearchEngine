As indicated by the fundamental theories on fake news in psychology and social sciences (see a comprehensive survey in Ref. [27]), the more a fake news article spreads, the higher the possibility of social media users spreading and trusting it due to repeated exposure and/or peer pressure. Such levels of trust and beliefs can easily be amplified and reinforced within social media due to its echo chamber effect [3]. Hence, extensive research has been conducted on effective detection of fake news to block its dissemination on social media. Fake news detection methods can be generally grouped into (1) content-based and (2) social-context-based methods. The main difference between the two types of methods is whether or not they rely on social context information: the information on how the news has propagated on social media, where abundant auxiliary information of social media users involved and their connections/networks can be utilized. Many innovative and significant solutions (e.g., [1, 13, 15]) have been proposed to exploit social context information. With more social context information available, one can often better detect fake news; however, detection becomes more challenging depending on the stage the news is currently at. It is difficult to detect fake news using social-context-based methods when it has been just published and has not been propagated (i.e., no social context information), which motivates us to further explore the role that news content can play in fake news detection.",

Existing content-based fake news detection methods either solely consider textual information [26], or combine both types of data ignoring the relationship (similarity) between them [4, 5, 23, 24]. The values in understanding such relationship (similarity) for predicting fake news are two-fold. To attract public attention, some fake news stories (or news stories with low-credibility) prefer to use dramatic, humorous (facetious), and tempting images whose content is far from the actual content within the news text. Furthermore, when a fake news article tells a story with fictional scenarios or statements, it is difficult to find both pertinent and non-manipulated images to match these fictions; hence a \u201cgap\u201d exists between the textual and visual information of fake news when creators use non-manipulated images to support non-factual scenarios or statements.1\n",

The method consists of three modules, performing (1) multi-modal (textual and visual) feature extraction; (2) within-modal (or say, modal-independent) fake news prediction; (3) cross-modal similarity extraction, respectively. For each news article, we first adopt neural networks to automatically obtain the latent representation of both its textual and visual information, based on which a similarity measure is defined between them. Then, such representations of news textual and visual information with their similarity are jointly learned and used to predict fake news. The proposed method aims to recognize the falsity of a news article on either its text or images, or the \u201cmismatch\u201d between the text and images.",

For example, P\u00e9rez-Rosas et al. employed lexical features by using bag-of-words with n-gram models, semantic features relying on LIWC [10], syntactic features such as context-free grammars, and news readability [11]. Instead of extracting features based on experience, Zhou et al. [26] validated the role of fundamental theories in psychology and social science in guiding fake news feature engineering. Rhetorical structures among sentences or phrases within news content have also been investigated with either a vector space model [14] or Bi-LSTM [6]. Researchers have also explored the political bias [12] and homogeneity [2] of news publishers by mining news content that they have published, and have demonstrated how such information can help detect fake news.",

To learn the multi-modal (textual and visual) representation of news content, Jin et al. developed VGG-19 and LSTM with an attention mechanism [4], and Khattar et al. designed an encoder-decoder mechanism [7]. Yang et al. proposed TI-CNN, which detects fake news by extracting both explicit and latent multi-modal features within news content [24]. Wang et al. proposed Event Adversarial Neural Network (EANN) to learn event-invariant features representative of news content across various topics and domains [23]. While current techniques have facilitated the development of multi-modal fake news detection, the relationship across modalities has been barely explored and exploited. Our work bridges this gap by directly capturing the relationship (similarity) between the textual and visual information within news content, and firstly learning the representation of news articles through mining its multi-modal information and the relationship across modalities.",

Social-context-based methods detect fake news by investigating social-context information related to news articles, i.e., how news articles spread on social media. Significant contributions have been made on identifying the differences in propagation patterns between fake news and the truth [20]. Such contributions have also focused on how user profiles [1] and opinions [13, 15] can help news verification using feature engineering [1] and neural networks [13, 15]. Nevertheless, verifying a news article that has been published online, e.g., on a news outlet such as BuzzFeed (https://www.buzzfeed.com/), before it has been disseminated on social media demands content-based methods as social-context information at this stage does not exist. For this purpose, we focus on mining news content in this work, where the proposed method will be detailed next.\n",

Compared to existing multi-modal fake news detection studies that often directly apply a pre-trained CNN (e.g., VGG) model to obtain the representation of news images [4, 23], we adopt the aforementioned processing strategy for consistency and to increase insights when computing the similarity across modalities. As we will demonstrate later in our experiments, it also leads to performance improvements.

We use a fine-tuned VGG-19 as one of the baselines; andatt-RNN [4]: att-RNN is a deep neural network model applicable for multi-modal fake news detection. It employs LSTM and VGG-19 with attention mechanism to fuse textual, visual and social-context features of news articles. We set the hyper-parameters the same as that in [4] and exclude the social-context features for a fair comparison.\n",

For this purpose, we went through the news articles in the two datasets, and compared their ground truth labels with their similarity scores computed by \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\mathsf {SAFE}$$\\end{document}. Several examples are presented in Figs. 5\u20136. It can be observed that (I) the gap between textual and visual information exist for some fictitious stories for (but not limited to) two reasons. First, such stories are difficult to be supported by non-manipulated images. An example is in Fig. 5a, where no voting- and bill-related image is actually available. Compared to the couples having a real intimate relationship (see Fig. 5c), the fake ones often have rare group photos or use collages (see Fig. 5c). Second, using \u201cattractive\u201d though not closely relevant images can help increase the news traffic. For example, the fake news in Fig. 5b includes an image with a smiling individual that conflicts with the death story.

The method extracts both textual and visual features of news content, and investigates their relationship. Experimental results indicate multi-modal features and the cross-modal relationship (similarity) are valuable with a comparable importance in fake news detection. Case studies conducted further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in assessing such similarity and predicting fake news. Nevertheless, we should point out the proposed method investigates textual and visual information without considering, e.g., network and video information. Additionally, relationships within modalities are valuable as well such as the textual (or visual) similarity among or between pairwise news articles, which both will be part of our future work.",
