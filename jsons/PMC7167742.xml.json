However, in some cases, such as malaria, the pathogen is difficult to culture in vitro at large scale. Moreover, the use of whole organisms as vaccines introduces a high antigenic load when often only a small subset of antigens is driving protection.2 There is also the possibility of adverse allergenic reactions to certain antigens in these preparations. These obstacles have led to an increased interest in subunit vaccines, in which single, or a select few, proteins are used in a vaccine formulation to induce protective immunity.3\n",

Seven of these vaccines have reached Phase III trial (Table 2). Much of this recent interest has focussed on T\u2010cell epitopes, with all of the vaccines to reach Phase III being T\u2010cell based. For many diseases, however, B\u2010cell responses also play an important role in immune protection, but peptide\u2010based vaccines based on B\u2010cell epitopes have proved more challenging for a number of reasons. Owing to the small size of peptides, they are generally poorly immunogenic. In addition, T\u2010cell epitopes required for the establishment of a robust immune response may also be absent in smaller peptides. To address these issues, carrier proteins or adjuvants are typically included in the vaccine formulation. Peptides are also prone to enzymatic degradation; to combat this, the epitopes can be modified by conformational stabilization or cyclisation, or peptide mimetics that are resistant to proteolysis can be used.5 Finally, and perhaps most importantly, peptide\u2010based approaches are limited because the antibody response to many protein antigens is dominated by conformational epitopes, which are difficult or impossible to capture effectively in a peptide\u2010based design.",

Our argument is structured as follows: first, we establish that disordered proteins represent an important class of antigen in a wide range of human pathogens. Second, we describe the unique features of these antigens and their interactions with antibodies, highlighting those properties that render them particularly suited to the development of peptide vaccines. In particular, we note that disordered epitopes appear invariably to be linear epitopes, so the challenge of capturing conformational epitopes in a peptide vaccine may not apply. We then outline some of the opportunities and challenges presented by the peptide\u2010based approach to vaccine development, as exemplified by efforts to develop a vaccine based on the disordered malaria antigen MSP2. Finally, we speculate on future developments, within peptide science and beyond, that will more fully enable the promise of this approach to be realized.",

As a result, disordered proteins are particularly abundant in a range of pathogenic organisms, and in some viruses,9, 10, 11, 12, 13 which must survive diverse and often hostile host environments. In these contexts, disordered proteins play important roles in host\u2010pathogen interactions,11 and accordingly, disordered proteins are often exposed to the host immune system.12 Even amongst bacteria, which have significantly more ordered proteomes than eukaryotic species, many proteins involved in pathogenic effector mechanisms appear to be disordered.11\n",

Despite the fact that these hypotheses have received limited direct experimental support, the underlying assumption that repetitive or disordered antigens will fail to elicit an effective antibody response continues to enjoy significant currency.19, 20, 21 However, recent sequencing of the genomes of several species of parasite has demonstrated that low\u2010complexity and disordered sequences are unusually abundant in a wide range of genes, including many that do not appear to be antigenically important.22 This suggests that the presence of such sequences in these parasites is not primarily a strategy to evade the host immune response. This has prompted significant debate surrounding the mechanisms responsible for generating and maintaining this abundance of low\u2010complexity sequence.23, 24, 25 In fact, it seems likely that distinct classes of low\u2010complexity sequences exist within parasite genomes, suggesting a diversity of contributory mechanisms.25\n",

It is not surprising, then, that a substantial fraction of malaria vaccine candidates contain regions of disorder, and that these regions are often important targets of antibodies. The most prominent example is the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), the dominant antigen on the surface of the sporozoite, the parasite form that is injected into the host by the mosquito and which must replicate within host hepatocytes prior to the establishment of the symptomatic blood\u2010stage infection.26 CSP has been extensively studied as an antigen for inclusion in a malaria vaccine, and the recently\u2010approved vaccine RTS,S includes the C\u2010terminal half of CSP, fused to the hepatitis B S\u2010antigen and assembled as a virus\u2010like particle.27 The RTS,S antigen includes the thrombospondin repeat domain at the C\u2010terminus of CSP, although it is not clear that this domain is correctly folded in the vaccine formulation.28 The rest of CSP is predicted to be disordered, and these predictions have been confirmed experimentally for the tetra\u2010peptide repeats of CSP that appear to be immunodominant and are targets of protective antibodies induced by RTS,S.29, 30, 31, 32\n",

In fact, we found a positive correlation between predicted disorder and the likelihood that any putative epitope will test positive in an antibody binding assay reported in the IEDB, establishing that disorder is no impediment to effective antibody recognition (Figure 1A). Others have recently made the same observation, and extended it to show that predictors of protein disorder out\u2010perform dedicated sequence\u2010based predictors for the identification of B\u2010cell epitopes.45 This may reflect the fact that residues that score highly in disorder predictors are more likely to be solvent\u2010exposed,43 as solvent exposure is both a prerequisite for, and established predictor of, antigenicity.46\n",

It is clear, however, that disordered proteins are capable of being recognized by protein binding partners, antibodies or otherwise. To achieve this, disordered proteins often undergo a process of coupled folding and binding in which the binding partner acts effectively as a template into which the disordered protein can fold into a relatively well\u2010defined bound conformation.51 Nonetheless, coupled folding and binding places both kinetic and thermodynamic constraints on the interaction.52 In particular, the significant entropic cost of folding reduces the overall binding affinity of these interactions, unless this cost can be offset by other means.53 Thus, the interactions of disordered proteins are often of relatively low affinity, despite maintaining high specificity. These properties are ideally suited to mediators of signals that must be switched on or off rapidly, accounting for the enrichment of disorder in proteins involved in signal transduction and regulation.7 These interactions are quite distinct, however, from typical antibody\u2010antigen interactions, which are selected for high affinity and slow dissociation.",

Thus, disordered epitopes rarely span more than 12 residues of the antigen primary sequence, and the majority of these residues make direct interactions with antibody. These structural observations are consistent with epitope mapping experiments with a large number of antibodies against several disordered antigens,38 which imply that disordered epitopes are overwhelmingly linear epitopes, and that antibody recognition is determined largely by the local antigen sequence.

These structural features imply that antibodies to disordered epitopes are better matched to the bound conformation of that epitope than are antibodies to ordered epitopes. It is likely that this reflects to some extent the ability of the disordered epitope to adapt to its binding site on the antibody. Indeed, this flexibility permits some disordered epitopes to adopt distinct conformations bound to different antibodies.50, 58, 59 Nonetheless, this exquisite complementarity is also likely to require adaptation on the part of the antibody.50 As such, it may also be seen as evidence to support the conclusion that affinity maturation of antibodies to disordered epitopes is at least as effective as is affinity maturation targeting ordered epitopes.",

It is important to note that for MSP2 the experimental measures of disorder used in this study correlate poorly with the disorder prediction scores used in the bioinformatics analysis, reflecting the uniformly high levels of disorder across MSP2 (>85% of MSP2 residues have IUPred scores >0.8). Indeed, the most flexible regions of MSP2 are extremely disordered, being composed exclusively of the small amino acids Gly, Ser, and Ala. Thus, it may be that this extreme level of disorder and attendant low sequence complexity is sufficient to significantly impede the development of a strong antibody response, whereas the levels of disorder more typically encountered in disordered antigens are compatible with a robust response, as outlined above.",

Moreover, a key advantage afforded by peptide\u2010based approaches to vaccine development is the ability to omit ineffective regions such as these polymorphic regions entirely, ensuring that the response is focused on conserved epitopes that are more likely to elicit broadly protective responses. This is exemplified by the long synthetic peptides derived from the C\u2010terminal half of MSP2, which have been considered potential components of a malaria vaccine.41, 67 These peptides include both conserved and dimorphic family\u2010specific sequences, but exclude the highly polymorphic regions of MSP2.",

Nonetheless, in some cases significant disorder persists in these interactions, giving rise to what are known as \u201cfuzzy interactions.\u201d78 It is becoming increasingly clear that these fuzzy interactions modulate the function of disordered proteins in several different ways. In particular, transient interactions involving the disordered regions flanking the structurally defined binding site can modulate the affinity with which disordered proteins are recognized by their binding partners.79 The extent to which such interactions modulate the antibody recognition of disordered antigens remains largely unexplored, but we have recently characterized one example which suggests that such modulation is feasible, and possibly quite general. The mAb 6D8, introduced above, recognizes a conserved epitope near the N\u2010terminus of MSP2, yet 6D8 binds the two allelic forms of MSP2 with affinities that differ by approximately five fold.71 NMR experiments provide evidence of transient interactions that are not resolved in the crystal structure and which involve variable residues that are distal to the structurally defined epitope. These transient or fuzzy interactions thus appear to modulate the specificity of 6D8, rendering the antibody somewhat strain\u2010specific in spite of the conserved nature of its epitope.71, 80 Although the generality of this effect remains to be established, it appears to originate from largely non\u2010specific interactions that occur, almost inevitably, as a result of the high effective concentration of the disordered regions that immediately flank the structurally defined epitope.80 As such, it is expected that similar fuzzy interactions may contribute to antibody recognition of many disordered antigens.",
