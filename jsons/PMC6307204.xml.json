The yearly incidence of sepsis is 300 cases per 100,000 and has been increasing years. This disease accounts for 2% of hospital admissions, roughly 9% of patients with sepsis progress to severe sepsis and 3% of those with severe sepsis experience septic shock, the most severe complication of sepsis, which is a deadly disease [1, 2]. In the last decade, a series of initiatives were implemented that aim not only to improve the understanding of sepsis and the clarity of concepts related to this condition but also to reduce morbidity and mortality due to sepsis through earlier diagnosis and initiation of antibiotic therapy.",

By binding to these ligands, DcR3 can prevent interaction with their cell surface-bound receptors and thereby inhibits cell apoptosis [6]. We previously showed that the expression level of DcR3 are increased in serum of sepsis patients, and is associated with the severity of the disease. It demonstrated that DcR3 has potential value for differential diagnosis of sepsis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) [7]. We also reported that treatment targeted Decoy Receptor 3 (DcR3) can protect mice from sepsis by suppressing the inflammatory response and lymphocyte-associated apoptosis [8].",

Pathogens, via their microbial-associated molecular patterns, lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Gram-negative bacteria), lipoteichoic acid (LTA, Gram-positive bacteria) and zymosan (Fungus), trigger sequential intracellular events in immune cells, epithelium, and the neuroendocrine system. TLRs (Toll-like receptors) with an extracellular domain that participates in bacterial ligand recognition are the most widely described PRRs [9\u201312]. TLR-2 andTLR-4, which are expressed on the cell surface, are the only TLRs known to be responsive to microbial ligands [13]. TLR-2 and TLR-4 signalling pathways are fundamental in sepsis pathophysiology [14]. In this study, we explored DcR3 expression levels in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and Jurkat cells stimulated by LPS, LTA and zymosan. SP600125, SB203580 and ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC) were used to inhibit JNK1/2, p38MAPK and NF-\u03baB signalling pathways respectively and study the signalling pathway regulating DcR3 secretion.",

DcR3 has three main ligands: FasL, LIGHT and TL1A. DcR3 binding to FasL protects against FasL-mediated apoptosis of lymphocytes and various tumour cell types, whereas DcR3 binding to LIGHT inhibits LIGHT-induced apoptosis [15\u201317]. Meanwhile, DcR3 binding to TL1A induces T cell activation [18]. Expression of DcR3 has been demonstrated in various acute and chronic inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [19, 20]. DcR3 was expressed in THP-1 and increased by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA).The formation of macrophage aggregates was observed when THP-1 cells were stimulated with DcR3-Fc [21]. Yang showed that pretreatment of HUVECs with DcR3 enhances the adhesion of THP-1 and U937 cells and primary monocytes [22]. DcR3 regulates CD14+ monocyte differentiation into dendritic cells. In addition, DcR3 triggers actin re-organization, increases the adhesion of monocytes, and reduces phagocytic activity and proinflammatory cytokine production in macrophages [23].",

Meanwhile, TLR-2 recognizes a broad range of microbial and host inflammatory agonists [30, 31]. Inflammation mediated by endothelial cells and inflammatory cell plays an important role in the process of sepsis. Endothelial cells dynamically regulate the vascular barrier, modulate vasomotor tone, play central roles in coagulation and hemostasis, and are critically involved in the movement of leukocytes between the bloodstream and extravascular tissues. Although a great deal is known about the effects of microorganisms on monocyte and macrophage inflammatory pathways, substantially less is known about their effects on endothelial cells, which have not classically been viewed as immune cells. However, similar to leukocytes, endothelial cells express innate immune receptors, including members of the TLRs family [32]. Flow cytometry experiments showed that TLR-2 and TLR-4 were highly expressed in HUVECs, while Jurkat cells displayed high TLR-4 expression but much lower TLR-2 expression. In the present study, we imitated sepsis using a cellular model by exposing cells to LPS (Gram-negative bacteria), LTA (Gram-positive bacteria) and zymosan (fungi) to stimulate HUVECs or Jurkat cells.",

Conventional MAPK family members include p38-MAPK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 and ERK5. The role of ERK1/2 signalling downstream of TLRs is complex, and studies to define the role of ERK1/2 have been hampered by the fact that several commonly used pharmacological inhibitors of MEK1, the upstream kinase of ERK1/2, inhibit the activity of both MEK1 and MEK5, the upstream kinase of ERK5 (e.g. PD98059, U0126 and PD184352 at concentrations > 1 mM). Therefore, it is not always clear whether the observed outcomes are due to the loss of ERK1/2 or ERK5 kinase activity. ERK5 is a recently identified mediator of the inflammatory response, but the signalling pathways that lead to the activation of ERK5 downstream of TLRs are not known [38\u201342].",
