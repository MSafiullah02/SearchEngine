In addition, management is directed at improving renal perfusion and oxygenation. Volume replacement with crystalloid or colloid should be undertaken to optimize preload. Central venous pressure or pulmonary wedge pressure monitoring is essential to guide volume replacement in children in severe shock (1, 2). The use of low-dose (2\u20135 pg/kg/min) dopamine to reduce renal vasoconstriction together with administration of inotropic agents such as dobutamine or epinephrine to improve cardiac output may reverse prerenal failure. Early elective ventilation should be undertaken in patients with severe shock. If oliguria persists despite volume replacement and inotropic therapy, dialysis should be instituted early, because septic and catabolic patients may rapidly develop hyperkalemia and severe electrolyte imbalance.",

Mortality is directly related to both the plasma endotoxin concentration and the intensity of the inflammatory response, as indicated by levels of TNF and other inflammatory markers (10). Patients with meningococcemia have a profound capillary leak leading to severe hypovolemia. Loss of plasma proteins from the intravascular space is probably the major cause of shock (11), but myocardial suppression secondary to IL-6 production is also important (12). Intense vasoconstriction further impairs tissue and organ perfusion, and vasculitis with intravascular thrombosis and consumption of platelets and coagulation factors is also present (6).",

This is prerenal in origin and may respond to volume replacement and inotropic support. If cardiac output cannot be improved and renal underperfusion persists, established renal failure supervenes. Occasionally, cortical necrosis or infarction of the kidneys occurs. Children with meningococcemia should be aggressively managed in a pediatric intensive care unit, with early administration of antibiotics (penicillin or a third-generation cephalosporin), volume replacement, hemodynamic monitoring, and the use of inotropic agents and vasodilators. If oliguria persists despite measures to improve cardiac output, elective ventilation and dialysis should be instituted early (6, 7). Because activation of coagulation pathways occurs, severe acquired protein-C deficiency may result and is usually associated with substantial mortality (13). Protein C is a natural anticoagulant which also has important anti-inflammatory activity. Despite evidence for impaired function of the activated protein C pathway in meningococcal diseases (14), and adult trials suggesting benefit of activated protein C administration in Septic shock (PROWESS trial) (15), pediatric trials of activated protein C showed no clear benefit, and were associated with increased risk of intracranial bleeding in very young infants (5). The role of aPC therapy in pediatric sepsis remains unclear. Most patients who survive the initial 24\u201348 h of the illness and regain hemodynamic stability will ultimately recover renal function even if dialysis is required for several weeks.",

PVL producing strains are associated with tissue necrosis and increased propensity to cause abscesses in lung, bone, joint, and soft tissue infections. Perinephric abscesses have been reported (26). There are increasing numbers of children and adults admitted with fulminant sepsis, and shock due to PVL producing strains, and renal failure is a significant component of the multiorgan failure. In addition to intensive care support, antibiotic treatment of PVL strains should include antibiotics which reduce toxin production, such as clindamycin, linezolid or rifampicin, as well as vancomycin if the strain is resistant to methicillin. Beta-lactam antibiotics should be avoided, as there is some data to suggest that PVL toxin production can increased by these antibiotics under some conditions (27).

The most common antecedent of invasive GAS disease is varicella infection, with the streptococcal infection developing after the initial vesicular phase of the disease is subsiding. Strains causing toxic shock syndrome and invasive disease appear to differ from common isolates of GAS in producing large amounts of pyrogenic toxins that may have superantigen-like activity. Another important mechanism is the production by invasive GAS of an IL8 protease. IL8 serves as a molecular bridge between receptors on neutrophils and the vascular endothelium. Cleavage of this protein prevents neutrophil attachment to the endothelium, and results in uncontrolled spread of the bacteria through the tissues (39). In severe cases necrotizing fasciitis occurs with extensive destruction of the subcutaneous tissues, and is often associated with multiorgan failure. The pathophysiology of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and that of invasive disease is similar in that superantigen toxins that induce release of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators play a role in both conditions. However GAS toxic shock is usually more severe, carries a higher mortality, and is more often associated with focal collections or necrotizing fasciitis.",

HUS associated with pneumococcal infection is induced by the enzyme neuraminidase released from S. pneumoniae (53, 54). Thomsen-Friedenrich antigen (T antigen) is present on the surface of red blood cells, platelets, and glomerular capillary endothelia against which antibodies are present in normal serum. Neuraminidase causes desialation of red blood cells, and possibly other blood cells and endothelium, by the removal of terminal neuraminic acid, which leads to unmasking of the T antigen. The resultant widespread agglutination of blood cells causes intravascular obstruction, hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure. Results of the direct Coombs test are frequently positive, either from bound anti-T IgM or from anti-T antibodies. The diagnosis of Thomsen-Friedenrich antibody-induced HUS should be suspected in patients with acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia and hemolysis after an episode of pneumonia or bacteremia caused by S. pneumoniae.

The illness begins with the sudden onset of high fever, skin rash, and GI symptoms. Later in the course, periungual desquamation develops, mimicking Kawasaki disease. Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, and thrombocytosis are noticeable, and mild degrees of proteinuria, glycosuria, and sterile pyuria are common. Acute renal failure, which typically develops 1\u20133 weeks after the onset of fever, follows a benign course with complete recovery. Renal biopsy mainly reveals findings of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis.

A major breakthrough in the search for the cause of HUS occurred in the 1980s when Karmali et al. reported that 11 of 15 children with diarrhea-associated HUS had evidence of infection with a strain of E. coli that produced a toxin active on Vero cells (75). In diarrhea-associated HUS in the United States and most of Europe, E. coli 0157:H7 is the most important of these strains. E. coli 0157:H7 occurs naturally in the GI tract of cattle and other animals, and humans become infected through contaminated food products. Most outbreaks have been associated with consumption of undercooked meat, but unpasteurized milk and cider, drinking water, and poorly chlorinated water for recreational use have also been implicated as vehicles for bacterial spread. HUS is discussed in detail in Chapter 67.",

It is generally estimated that, overall, one-third of the world's population is currently infected with the TB bacillus. There are more than 8 million cases of TB, which result in the death of approximately 2 million people each year. Furthermore, 5\u201310% of people who are infected with the TB bacillus develop TB disease or become infectious at some time during their lives (76, 77). After respiratory illness in children, mycobacteria are widely distributed to many organs of the body during the lymphohematogenous phase of childhood TB (78). Tubercle bacilli can be recovered from the urine in many cases of miliary TB. Hematogenously-spread tuberculomata develop in the glomeruli, which results in caseating, sloughing lesions that discharge bacilli into the tubules.

Patients who develop renal impairment present with oliguria and rising urea and creatinine levels. They are usually severely ill, with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, fever, and leukocytosis.

The pathogenesis of the renal impairment is uncertain, but the organism has been detected within the kidney on electron microscopy and immunofluorescent studies, which suggests a direct toxic effect. Myoglobinuria and decreased perfusion may also be contributing factors, however. Mortality has been high in reported cases of Legionnaires\u2019 disease complicated by renal failure.

Most subsequent evidence, however, indicates that immunologic mechanisms rather than emboli are involved in the pathogenesis in most cases: bacteria are rarely found within the kidney, and renal involvement occurs with lesions of the right side of the heart, which would not be likely to embolize to the kidney. Immune complexes containing bacterial antigens are present in the circulation, and both bacterial antigens and bacteria-specific antibodies can be demonstrated within the immune deposits in the kidney. Serum C3 level is usually low, and complement can be found within both the circulating and the deposited immune complexes.

            "text": "Immunologic deposition of HBV and antibody in the glomerular capillary wall is clearly involved in the glomerular injury, but the underlying immunologic events are incompletely understood (110, 122). Passive trapping of circulating immune complexes may be involved, but the circulating immune complexes containing HBsAg are usually larger than would be expected to penetrate the basement membrane. HBsAg and HBcAg are anionic and are therefore unlikely to penetrate the glomerular capillary wall. In contrast, HBeAg forms smaller complexes with anti-HBe antibodies and may readily penetrate the GBM. This may explain the observation that HBeAg in the circulation frequently correlates with the severity of the disease (110). An alternative mechanism for immune-mediated glomerular injury is the trapping of HBV antigens by antibody previously deposited in the kidney. Anti-HBe antibodies are cationic and may readily localize in the glomerulus and subsequently bind circulating antigen and complement. The third possibility is that the depositions of HBV and antibodies are consequences of glomerular injury by cellular mechanisms or autoantibodies. Little evidence supports this view at present (110). A transgenic mouse model of HBV-associated nephropathy has been developed, in which HBsAg and HBcAg is expressed in liver and kidney, particularly tubular epithelial cells, without viral replication. In these mice, gene expression analysis revealed upregulation of acute-phase proteins, particularly C3, although measurable serum C3 levels were reduced. This supports the notion that local persistent expression of HBV viral proteins contributes to HBV-associated nephropathy (123).",

In one small series in children, MPGN was found to be equal in incidence to MGN in the spectrum of HBV-associated GNs (124). Both MPGN and mesangial proliferative GN may be triggered by HBV. In several countries where HBV is common, the proportion of patients with these forms of nephritides who test positive for HBV greatly exceeds the incidence of positivity in the general population (122). As with MGN and HBV-associated PAN, circulating immune complexes and localization of HBV antigens in the glomeruli have been reported in both MPGN and mesangial proliferative GN, and it is likely that similar mechanisms are occurring (110, 125). Several other forms of GN have been associated with HBV, including IgA nephropathy, focal glomerulosclerosis, crescentic nephritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus, but the evidence for these associations is less consistent than for the entities discussed earlier (125).",

It is not surprising, therefore, that the administration of steroids and immunosuppressive agents either may have no effect on HBV disease or may increase the risk of progressive disease (126). Children with HBV MGN have a good prognosis, and two-thirds undergo spontaneous remission within 3 years of diagnosis. Steroid therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit (110, 120, 110). Antiviral therapy with pegylated interferon-alpha and lamivudine shows promise in facilitating clearance of HBV, and in some cases, elimination of the infection with antiviral therapy in both children and adults is associated with improvement or resolution of the coexisting renal disease. There is considerable effort being put into the development of newer anti-viral agents which avoid the common problems of resistance associated with lamivudine (127\u2013129).",

Patients who are CMV seropositive at the time of transplantation are also at risk of reactivation and superinfection. Tubulointerstitial nephritis is a well-characterized pathologic feature of renal allograft CMV disease, which can be difficult to distinguish from injury caused by rejection. Histologic evidence of endothelial cell injury and mononuclear cell infiltration in the glomeruli has been reported (148). CMV glomerular vasculopathy in the absence of tubulointerstitial disease, causing renal allograft dysfunction, has also been reported (150). Beyond the acute allograft nephropathy associated with CMV viremia, CMV is known to cause chronic vascular injury. This may adversely affect the long-term outcome of the allograft and may be the explanation for the observed association with chronic allograft nephropathy (151).",

Major limitations of ganciclovir therapy are the induction of renal tubular dysfunction and bone marrow toxicity, principally neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Dosage adjustments are necessary for recipients with renal dysfunction. Oral valganciclovir is now used for CMV prophylaxis post-transplant (152).

Histologic findings include endocapillary cell proliferation, epithelial and endothelial cell hyperplasia, and inflammatory cell infiltration (154). Rapidly progressive nephritis has also been reported. Immunohistochemical studies reveal glomerular deposition of IgG, IgM, IgA, and C3. On electron microscopy, granular electron-dense deposits have been found in the paramesangial region, and varicella antigens may be deposited in the glomeruli.

Acute nephritis and nephrotic syndrome have been associated with herpes simplex encephalitis. Renal histology shows focal segmental GN with mesangial and segmental deposits of IgM, C3, and HSV antigens. As with other herpes viruses, HSV has been suggested as a trigger for IgA nephritis, MPGN, and membranous nephropathy. Elevated levels of HSV antibodies have been reported in patients with a variety of forms of GN, but no conclusive evidence exists of an etiologic role for HSV (160).",

In the affected glomeruli, visceral epithelial cells are hypertrophied and hyperplastic, and contain large cytoplasmic vacuoles and numerous protein resorption droplets. There is microcystic distortion of tubule segments, which contributes to increasing kidney size. Podocyte hyperplasia can become so marked that it causes obliteration of much of the urinary space, forming \u201cpseudocrescents\u201d (173). Capillary walls are wrinkled and collapsed with obliteration of the capillary lumina. The interstitium is edematous with a variable degree of T-cell infiltration (181). The Bowman capsule can also be dilated and filled with a precipitate of plasma protein that represents the glomerular ultrafiltrate. One of the most distinctive features of HIVAN, however, is the presence of numerous tubuloreticular inclusions within the cytoplasm of glomerular and peritubular capillary endothelial cells (173). Immunofluorescence testing is positive for IgM and C3 in capillary walls in a coarsely granular to amorphous pattern in a segmental distribution (180, 181).",

In addition, blocking renal receptors for chemokines such as RANTES (regulated upon derivation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), interleukin-8, and monocyte-chemoattractant protein-1 has been proposed as another possible treatment alternative (195).",

Furthermore, quartan malaria nephropathy may be seen in children with no evidence of P. malariae infection or deposition of malaria antigens in the kidney. This, together with the fact that antimalarial treatment does not affect the progression of the disorder, raises the possibility that factors other than malaria might be involved in the initiation and perpetuation of the disorder. Although there is undoubtedly a strong association between P. malariae infection and nephrotic syndrome on epidemiologic grounds, the direct causal link is not proven. Most likely, a number of different infectious processes, including malaria, hepatitis B, schistosomiasis, and perhaps other parasitic infections that cause chronic or persistent infections and often occur concurrently in malaria areas, may all result in glomerular injury and a range of overlapping histopathologic features. The prognosis for the nephrotic syndrome in most African studies has been poor, regardless of whether the histologic findings were typical of quartan malaria nephropathy or whether P. malariae parasitemia was implicated.

Blackwater fever has become rare since 1950, when quinine was replaced by chloroquine. However, the disease reappeared in the 1990s, after the reuse of quinine because of the development of chloroquine-resistant organisms. Since then, several cases have been described after therapy with halofantrine and mefloquine, two new molecules similar to quinine (amino-alcohol family) (253). Renal failure generally occurred in the context of severe hemolytic anemia, hemoglobinuria, and jaundice. The pathophysiology of the disorder is unclear; however, it appears that a double sensitization of the red blood cells to the P. falciparum and to the amino-alcohols is necessary to provoke the hemolysis. Histopathologic findings include swelling and vacuolization of proximal tubules, necrosis and degeneration of more distal tubules, and hemoglobin deposition in the renal tubules.

Acute renal failure caused by systemic candidiasis or obstruction of the renal tracts with fungal hyphae is a well-recognized complication of systemic candidal infection (266, 267). Indwelling catheters (which form a nidus for persistent infection) should be removed. Successful treatment of non-obstructing bilateral renal fungal balls by fluconazole either alone or in combination with liposomal amphotericin B has been reported (268, 269). In the presence of obstruction, however, percutaneous nephrostomy to relieve the obstruction with antegrade amphotericin B irrigation, coupled with systemic antifungal therapy, is the mainstay of treatment (267). Amphotericin B is the most effective antifungal agent, but it is not excreted in the urine. Local irrigation via nephrostomy provides good results, however. For treatment of urinary tract candidiasis, it is usually combined with fluconazole or 5-flucytosine, both of which are excreted in high concentrations in the urine. Treatment is required for weeks to months to ensure complete elimination of the fungus, and the ultimate outcome is largely dependent on whether there is a permanent defect in immunity.",
