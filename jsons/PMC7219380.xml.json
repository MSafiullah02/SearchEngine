Aggressive antigen testing has been key to the success of containment in a number of countries including Germany and South Korea.19 However, this has proven to be resource intensive. Thus, the capacity constraints of implementing large scale antigen testing will need to be carefully considered.20 For example, the availability of PCR machines, reagents and the trained personnel to carry out these tests and interpret their results will require careful planning.17\n",
