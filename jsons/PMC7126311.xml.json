            "text": "On March 12, 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a worldwide alert for cases of atypical pneumonia with severe respiratory illness that was rapidly spreading among hospital staffs (1). The transmission route of the emerging disease was believed to be by inhalation of contaminated aerosols or by oral route through contact with a contaminated environment (2, 3). Both specific droplet and rigorous universal precautions were thus recommended for healthcare workers (HCWs) taking care of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (4). Early in the SARS epidemic, investigators reported that surgical masks were equivalent to N-95 masks in protecting against SARS, but it was later shown that even N-95 masks were not completely protective (3, 5, 6). This confusion, plus the fact that many HCWs became infected despite wearing masks, contributed to the tremendous fear and chaos in some areas affected by SARS (7, 8).",

The cluster was carefully selected because the spread of transmission occurred in a very short time, making the cause-relationship unambiguous. We also used the human 18s-rRNA as an internal control to avoid sampling variation. Although we could not control for a number of other factors that might have affected transmission, we believe it is worth attempting to assess the effect of PPE, including an N-95 mask, on viral load and subsequent outcome of SARS.",

Between April 27 and June 16, 2003, a total of 167 patients diagnosed as probable (n = 71) and suspected (n = 96) SARS were treated in the hospital wards and Emergency Department (ED). Since May 12, a total of 41 negative pressure isolation rooms (including four in the ED) were established for these patients. Clearly, it is very difficult to track and clarify every transmission route in facing such variable sources of patients. Therefore, we carefully selected a cluster of victims whose source of infection can be tracked back to a common index patient. On May 4, 2003, a 50-year-old male was sent to the ED of Mackay Memorial Hospital in Taipei. He had had fever for the previous 6 days, and a severe cough with dyspnea for 1 day. He was a cook, and had no travel history or specific contact history for SARS. On arrival in the ED, he was given bronchodilatator therapy by nebulization for his respiratory distress. Two hours later, his chest X-ray study showed multi-focal air space consolidations, and the patient was then immediately isolated. Five hours later, he developed intractable hypoxia and respiratory failure, so he was intubated and mechanically ventilated. Twenty-four hours later, he died of SARS in the ED isolation unit.",

In several previous reports on SARS, HCWs were less likely to die than non-HCWs (9, 13, 21). Possible reasons for this may be that they were often younger than non-HCWs, sought treatment earlier, and were less likely to have coexisting illnesses (especially diabetes mellitus and heart disease) (11, 13, 14, 17). It has also been postulated that HCWs may have had lower exposure to the virus and thus a lower viral load, possibly due to the use of PPE (13, 14, 22). The initial exposure to the virus and viral load seem to correlate with disease severity. We speculate that the PPE worn by our HCWs, in particular the N-95 masks, may have minimized their exposure to the virus, resulting in lower viral loads, a relatively mild disease course, and a better outcome.",

However, no one in contact with him, either among his traveling companions or Japanese, became infected, despite the understandable fear in Japan when the patient was diagnosed with SARS on his return to Taiwan (23). None of the other three HCWs transmitted the disease to coworkers or family members despite contact with others during the incubation period. It should be noted that all 3 were isolated immediately after they developed fever, which presumably also decreased the risk of spread, because the patients with SARS were apparently contagious only with the onset of fever. This contrasts with the non-HCWs, who had not worn N-95 masks, had a higher vial load by quantitative RT-PCR, and 3 of whom transmitted SARS to family members. Although immediate reporting of symptoms with early diagnosis and immediate isolation is key to controlling the spread of SARS, use of a high quality mask may minimize initial exposure and thus reduce secondary household transmission.",

HLA-B* 4601/B46 is seen in 13.2% to 15.4% of people of southern Chinese origin, 2.8% in those from northern China, and is seldom present in European populations (25). In our cluster, 4 of 9 non-HCWs and 1 of 4 HCWs had this particular allele. There is, however, no single laboratory study that has been definitively shown to define accurately the prognosis in SARS. In some studies, an increased LDH and an elevated neutrophil count at the time of admission, as well as low CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte counts, were associated with a poor prognosis (2, 11, 13). In our series, CRP, an acute-phase protein synthesized by the liver after stimulus by various cytokines produced in response infection or inflammation, was markedly higher in non-HCWs than in HCWs. It has been correlated clinically with an increased risk of organ dysfunction and poor prognosis in a heterogeneous population of critically ill patients (26). In our series, the greatest hematologic and laboratory abnormalities and oxygen desaturation occurred during the second week after fever onset (FD 7 to FD 14). According to a report from Hong Kong, the second week was a critical period of SARS when patients either clinically improved or worsened and developed respiratory distress syndrome necessitating ventilatory support. In a subset of their series, these authors found that the second week marked the peak and subsequent fall in viral load, concurrent with the appearance of antibodies (17).",

Other investigators have reported a relatively higher concentration of viral RNA in the sputum than in the serum, urine, and stool. Its presence in the latter suggests that viral replication occurs elsewhere in addition to the respiratory tract. However, the shedding of virus from the respiratory mucosa would seem to be the primary route of transmission (17, 27). Such a conclusion is also supported by our observation that the amount of the virus was positively associated with the extent of mucosal shedding. Using human 18s-RNA as internal control in some samples, we found that sampling variation and mucosal shedding may significantly affect the virus numbers. Nevertheless, our findings support the contention that crude viral load on nasopharyngeal swab correlated with disease severity and outcome.",

Chest CT scan reportedly showed changes consistent with pulmonary fibrosis in 62% of 24 survivors of SARS at 5 weeks after discharge (28). For the majority of patients for whom data are available, the CT abnormalities interpreted as fibrosis had included a patchy ground-glass appearance that was not extensive and that might not have a significant impact on lung function (28, 29, 30). In our case series, abnormalities on HRCT scan were more common in non-HCWs than HCWs, even 6 months after discharge. The findings were predominantly ground-glass opacification rather than parenchymal bands and are therefore more suggestive of potentially reversible fibrosing alveolitis rather than pulmonary fibrosis. Pathophysiologically, the possibility of acute reversible lung damage suggests that SARS infection might cause some degree of chronic viral pneumonitis in addition to acute disease (personal communication).",

Some of the restrictive defect might be attributable to skeletal muscle weakness rather than parenchymal lung damage alone. Such muscle weakness might be due to several factors, including the use of high-dose steroids, prolonged bed rest leading to physical deconditioning, or residual systemic effect of the acute disease (2, 28). Whatever the cause, the outcome in our small series indicates that the lung function abnormality caused by SARS may improve spontaneously. We found improvement in radiologic, functional, and psychological abnormalities over time. At almost half a year after SARS, the survivors had normal lung function (including normal cardiopulmonary exercise test, data not shown), normal psychosocial behavior, and only minimal residual radiologic abnormalities.",

These may have included ventilation in the ER, proximity of the subjects to the index case, duration of exposure, and perhaps other unknown elements involved in transmission. HCWs may have been more aware of and had better hygiene practices than the non-HCWs. However, the exact extent of the spread of infectious viral-laden droplets when the patient coughed is difficult to determine. RT-PCR for SARS-CoV was positive in samples taken from the floor, a desk, and a bed-rail in the ED (personal communication). Because both HCWs and non-HCWs moved around in the ED, we cannot be certain exactly when and where their exposures actually occurred. This is one reason we selected this one cluster of infection, because it is highly likely that all patients who were present in the ED when the index patient was there were infected at that time. Another limitation is that the numbers in this series are very small, making statistical analysis very uncertain. However, the HCWs did have a lower mean viral load, even though several had very close contact with the index patient, particularly during intubation, when one would expect an extremely high risk of exposure to a heavy viral load.",
