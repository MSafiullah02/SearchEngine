These interleukins normally provide growth, differentiation and survival signals for B, T and NK cells. These signals are disrupted becasue of altered leukocyte receptors in \u03b3c deficiency. Patients become symptomatic between 3 to 6 months of age as protective maternal immunoglobulins are depleted, presenting without tonsils or lymph nodes along with severe life-threatening recurring infections. Circulating T and natural killer (NK) lymphocytes are nearly absent. B cells are adequate in number but are dysfunctional. Children with \u03b3c deficiency fail to thrive and death usually occurs before age 2 unless treatment with hematopoietic stem cell transplant is successful.3 Gene therapy has been effective in clinical trials; however, there is a significant risk of leukemic transformation.",

Approximately 60% of cases are X-linked recessive and 40% are autosomal recessive.26 X-linked recessive patients experience a more severe disease course and have shorter lifespans than autosomal recessive patients. CGD is caused by mutations in genes responsible for proteins that make up the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase. Under normal conditions, phagocytosis of foreign organism leads to phosphorylation and binding of cytosolic p47phos and p67phos.17 Primary granules containing antibacterial neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G and secondary granules containing the cytochrome complex gp91phox and gp22phox migrate to the phagolysosome. NADPH oxidase forms when p47phos and p67phos along with p40phox and RAC2 combine with the cytochrome complex. Superoxide is generated in the phagolysosome when an electron from NADPH is added to oxygen. NADPH has additional regulatory functions in the generation of other antimicrobial agents. Most cases of CGD are due to mutations in gp91phox or p47. The genes implicated in CGD and protein products are listed in Table 26.2\n.",

NP has three subtypes. Types A and B are caused by recessive mutations in the SMPD1 gene located within the chromosomal region 11p15.4. This results in a deficiency of lysosomal hydrolase enzyme acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) and a subsequent buildup of the substrate sphingomyelin in the liver, spleen, and lungs.40 More than 180 mutations in SMPD1 have been reported.40 Foam cells and sea-blue histiocytes can be seen in the bone marrow. Foam cells are macrophages with cytoplasm packed with lipid-filled lysosomes that appear as small vacuoles (foam) after staining (Figure 26.9\n). Sea blue histiocytes are macrophages with lipofuscin-, glycophospholipid-, and sphingomyelin contained in -cytoplasmic granules, 1 to 3 \u03bc in diameter, that appear blue with Wright stain. Type A (acute neuronopathic form) NP mostly affects Eastern European Jews. Type A presents in infancy and is associated with failure to thrive, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, vision problems, and rapid neurodegenerative decline that results in death, usually by 4 years of age. In type A, there is less than 5% of normal sphingomyelinase activity. In type B (the non-neuronopathic form) there is approximately 10% to 20% normal enzyme activity.52 Type B NP is more common in individuals of Northern African descent and presents in the first decade to adulthood with a variable clinical course. Although there is no neurocognitive impairment, patients experience massive hepatosplenomegaly, heart disease, and pulmonary insufficiency.53 Diagnosis of types A and B NP is based on enzymatic quantitation of sphingomyelinase activity in cell or tissue extracts. Genetic testing screens for three genes responsible for more than 90% of cases in the Ashkenazi Jewish population and one gene in approximately 90% of type B patients from North Africa.40, 53 Treatment primarily consists of enzyme replacement therapy, although it is ineffective at slowing the progression of neurologic disease in type A patients.",

The severity of infection, inflammation, or dose of CSF influences ANC and level of immaturity of neutrophils released into circulation. Additionally, neutrophils may exhibit changes in morphology such as toxic granulation, D\u00f6hle bodies, and cytoplasmic vacuoles. Toxic granulation appears as dark, blue-black granules in the cytoplasm of neutrophils, usually in segmented and band forms. Toxic granules are peroxidase positive and reflect an increase in acid mucosubstance within primary, azurophilic granules that may enhance bactericidal activity.79 There is a positive correlation between level of C-reactive protein (an acute phase protein) and the number of neutrophils with toxic granulation; therefore toxic granulation is suggestive of inflammation.7\n,\n80 In addition, toxic granulation can be seen in various infections as well as in patients who have received G-CSF.81 Toxic granulation can mimic granulation found in Alder-Reilly anomaly. One helpful defining characteristic of toxic granulation is that in most cases, not all neutrophils are equally affected (Figure 26.10\n).

When primary infection with EBV occurs in childhood, it often goes unnoticed. Early childhood infection with EBV is not usually identified as the symptoms are generally mild and overlap with other viral syndromes. The incubation period of IM is approximately 3 to 7 weeks, and during this time EBV preferentially infects B lymphocytes through attachment of viral envelope glycoprotein 350/220 to CD21 (C3d complement receptors).94 The oropharynx epithelial cells are also infected, but the mechanism is unclear because these cells do not express CD21. The cellular response in IM is important in the control of the infection and is characterized by proliferation and activation of NK lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ memory cytotoxic T cells (EBV-CTLs) in response to B cell infection.

Clinical findings include recurring severe infections, organomegaly, and neurologic defects.\u2022Shwachman-Diamond syndrome is characterized by exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, digestive issues, infections, physical anomalies, neurologic defects, bone marrow failure, and increased risk of leukemia.\u2022Chronic granulomatous disease results from a failure in the neutrophil respiratory burst after ingestion of organisms. Patients suffer from severe recurrent infections; however, advances in the use of antimicrobial agents have been effective at improving the clinical condition.\u2022WHIM (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis syndrome) is a disorder of white blood cell (WBC) movement from the bone marrow to blood resulting in leukopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, bacterial infections, human papillomavirus infection, and warts.\u2022Pelger-Hu\u00ebt anomaly is a genetic disorder resulting in hypolobulated mature leukocytes. These cells can be confused with immature neutrophils. An acquired form of hyposegmentation called pseudo-Pelger-Hu\u00ebt is associated with hematologic neoplasms and other disorders.\u2022Alder-Reilly anomaly is a manifestation of mucopolysaccharidosis characterized by metachromatic granules in leukocytes, which can be confused with toxic granulation.\u2022May-Hegglin anomaly is characterized by thrombocytopenia, giant platelets, and D\u00f6hle body-like inclusions in leukocytes. Most cases are asymptomatic.\u2022Lysosomal storage disorders are congenital deficiencies of lysosomal enzymes and impaired digestion of macromolecules, which accumulate and impair cellular functions.\u2022The mucopolysaccharidoses are associated with a specific defect in an enzyme necessary for the degradation of glycoaminoglycan (GAG). Partially digested GAGs build up and disrupt cellular functions leading to serious physical and neurologic problems.\u2022Gaucher disease is characterized by a deficiency in \u03b2-glucocerebrosidase and accumulation of cell sphingolipids leading to a range of clinical manifestations and increased risk for malignant transformation\u2022Niemann-Pick disease is caused by a deficiency in sphingomyelinase and buildup of fats in various organs in the body, resulting in neurologic defects, organomegaly, failure to thrive, and early death.\u2022Reactive changes in neutrophils include a left shift, D\u00f6hle bodies, toxic granulation, and vacuoles.\u2022Reactive morphology in monocytes includes segmenting nuclei, changes in granule color and size, and irregular cytoplasmic borders.\u2022Reactive changes in lymphocytes include increased size, increased basophilic cytoplasm, and morphologic heterogeneity.\n",
