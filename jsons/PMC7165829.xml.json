The first is the story of the Monkey King, a retelling of the first seven chapters of the 16th\u2010century Chinese literary classic Journey to the West. The Monkey King is excluded from a celestial dinner party on the grounds that he is a monkey. In his anger, he begins a reign of destruction against other heavenly beings. He is eventually imprisoned under a mountain by the deity Tze\u2010Yo\u2010Tzuh. He is released only when he accepts that he is a monkey, whereupon he joins the monk Lai\u2010Tsao in his journey to the West. The story introduces the key themes of the text: the Monkey King becomes aware of his difference from others only when it is pointed out to him, and this difference causes a crisis in self\u2010identity. He struggles to reinvent himself and eventually learns to embrace his identity.",

He represents the many negative Asian identities which the characters will have thrust upon them if they do not actively and continually reinvent themselves.

During the 19th\u2010century newspaper, cartoons depicted the Chinese as animal\u2010like and violent (see Fig. 3 and Choy et al.'s Coming Man (1994)). Early American newspapers such as The Wasp (1842\u20131843) featured racist caricatures of Asians in keeping with this mythology. These early cartoons depicted Chinese immigrants with slits for eyes, wearing coolie outfits and with ponytails. For Fu, Chin\u2010Kee serves as \u2018an effective way to dispel the century\u2010old image of the \u201cHeathen Chinese\u201d \u2019 (Fu 2006, 276).",

Examples include Smash Comics character Wun Cloo (Smith 2013, online), the recurring Marvel villain The Yellow Claw and the DC character Chop Chop (Yang 2008, online). These characters were more wily than their previous incarnations and some even occupied the role of the protagonist, but their caricatured features and coolie dress had changed little since the 1880s. Colour printing also expanded the cartoon language to include sallow skin as an Asian signifier. Yang appropriates this language for Chin\u2010Kee and, to a lesser extent, for Jin (see Boatright 2010, 473). During World War II, racist depictions of Japanese soldiers in comic books shared a visual language with anti\u2010Japanese propaganda posters (see Dong 2011, 243). These comics blended and confused all Asians under the generic stereotype of the Oriental man who, amongst other misdeeds, imprisons and sells women (see Fig. 1).2 Chin\u2010Kee, in keeping with this mythology, drools over American women and wishes to bind their feet (Yang 2006, 50).",

These stereotypes have roots in the 19th\u2010century depictions of the Chinese (see Choy et al. (1994) for examples). Gardner describes modern depictions of Asian Americans as \u2018mechanised alien robots\u2019 (Gardner 2010, 135). These stereotypes appear most often, he argues, in school newspapers. Yang's Chin\u2010Kee embarrasses his cousin by knowing the answer to every question posed in class (Yang 2006, 111\u2013113). The most disturbing aspect of Chin\u2010Kee is his similarity to certain modern, and unironically racist, depictions of Asian Americans in political cartoons and televised media. The reference to \u2018Clispy fried cat gizzard\u2019 (Yang 2006, 114) quotes a 2001 editorial cartoon by Pat Oliphant (see Gardner 2010, 132). Chin\u2010Kee's performance of \u2018She Bangs\u2019 references the performance by Asian American singer William Hung (see Fu 2007, 275; Vizzini 2007, online). One high schooler is afraid that Chin\u2010Kee's spit will infect him with the SARS virus (Yang 2006, 202).",

The Monkey King, for Fu, offers a Chinese alternative to the superheroes who have dominated the pages of American comic books. Fu's argument is problematic given that the American comic book is a medium which has historically been used to explore the immigrant experience. Superman, the prototypical superhero, is an immigrant, having travelled from Krypton to Earth (see Dooley and Engle 1988). Like Stan Lee (Leiber), and Jack Kirby (Kurzberg), and like Jin/Danny, a recurring characteristic of the superhero genre is the second identity adopted by a hero in order to survive in American society. Indeed, in contrast to the largely negative vision of American comics sketched by Fu and Gardner, many modern American comics counter the racism of previous eras.",

The increasing visibility of Asian and Asian American characters in American comics has not been entirely absent from the literature on American Born Chinese to date, but the emphasis on the history of racism and, in Gardner's case, reliance upon too slim a sample of Asian American alternative comics threatens to present a far bleaker landscape than a wider view of the literature might reveal.",

Translated manga provides an authentic insight into Japanese society, and many manga, such as the English\u2010language version of the series Lone Wolf and Cub (2000\u20132003), include explanatory essays on Japanese history and culture. The increasing availability of manga has inspired the genre \u2018AmeriManga\u2019 by American creators such as Fred Gallagher (see ANN 2002). AmeriManga comics are drawn by American creators using the visual conventions of Japanese manga. Gallagher's Megatokyo (2000\u2013present) concerns the life of an American living in Tokyo and contains many references to Japanese culture and cross\u2010cultural interactions.

Read in the context of American Born Chinese, her suit serves to physically alienate her from her fellow students and serves as a dramatisation of the same social exclusion which Jin/Danny experiences at school.

The original Journey to the West is a mythical story of how Buddhism came to China from India.

Yang adapts the tale of the Monkey King not only into a story of self\u2010discovery but also into a Judeo\u2010Christian story. Tze\u2010Yo\u2010Tzuh, who imprisons the Monkey King, is Yang's creation and is more similar to an Abrahamic deity than any figure from Buddhist or Taoist traditions (Vizzini 2007, online). The story of Journey to the West, in Yang's telling, becomes the story of the Magi (the three kings) who bring gifts to the baby Jesus, signified by the shining star which the Monkey King and Lai\u2010Tsao walk toward (Vizzini 2007, online). Yang has described Christianity as \u2018the world that I'm a little more familiar with\u2019 compared with Chinese religious traditions (Yang in Morton 2010, online).4 Yang's blend of Chinese and Western mythologies fuses cultural codes and introduces the theme of transformation into the text. It also serves to destabilise concepts of a monolithic Asian culture by providing an introduction to Chinese mythology. Yang uses these references to distinguish between historical Chinese culture and modern Asian American identities.",

I argue that the use of untranslated traditional Chinese characters serves to other Chinese language. Yang presents Chinese script as the language of what Fu calls \u2018oriental magic\u2019; the characters speak Chinese characters in order to activate their magical powers (Fu 2006, 275). The relationship between American English and Chinese script mirrors the relationship between Jin/Danny and his parent's culture. Both Dong and I argue that Jin/Danny (who speaks Mandarin but struggles to read Chinese script) should be read as a relative outsider in relation to China's literary history: \nJin has no means to represent modern China or the postmemory of the Cultural Revolution, just a myriad of imagined Chinas drawn primarily from the American cultural imagination.

Doughty contends that Chin\u2010Kee's name doubles as both the English\u2010language racial slur \u2018Chinky\u2019 and a combination of the character \u2018relative\u2019 and the English word \u2018key\u2019. Chin\u2010Kee (or \u2018\u2010key\u2019) is a counterpart to Danny, whose name in Mandarin sounds like \u2018big you\u2019 or \u2018strike you\u2019 (Doughty 2010, 56\u201357). Doughty reads this doubled language as a dramatisation of the internal struggle between Jin/Danny's Chinese and American racialised identities. Chin\u2010Kee, the Chinese blood relative, is the key who can unlock Danny and transform him back into Jin. The repeated strikes which Chin\u2010Kee delivers to Danny's face (and Wei\u2010Chen delivers to Jin's face) represents Jin's internal struggle to come to terms with his own racial identity. Doughty's analysis omits the usual rendering of the English name Danny into Chinese \u2018big inside/within\u2019. Beneath Danny's seemingly unremarkable White face is a chaotic internal world. On the surface, he appears to be a member of America's racial and religious majority, but on the inside, he struggles to reconcile his American and Chinese identities.",

Transformers are robots which can change into vehicles, dinosaurs or other objects (examples include a cassette player). In the Transformers television series (1984\u20132012), comic books (1984\u2010present) and films (animated 1986\u20131998, live action 2007\u20132011), the Autobots, the heroic protagonists, arrive in America to do battle with their enemies the Decepticons and to secure the fuel they need to return home. The Transformers are biracial in the sense that they are the result of an American\u2013Japanese partnership. They are also, like Superman, immigrants to Earth, having been displaced from their home planet, Cybertron. The Transformers can hide their true nature and become unremarkable in their new home.",

Wei\u2010Chen is a monkey who has transformed into a human. Yang makes the allusion explicit when Wei\u2010Chen's father, the Monkey King, gives him a Transformer toy \u2018to remind you of who you are\u2019 (Yang 2006, 217). For Fu, the Monkey King himself is the most intriguing transformer. Not only does the Monkey King use his magical powers to transform his appearance throughout the text but also Yang transforms The Monkey King's story, as noted above, into a Christianised journey toward self\u2010acceptance which parallels Jin/Danny's transformation. The Monkey King's story is also a literal journey to the West. He begins in mythical China and travels to America (rather than beginning in India and travelling to China in the original Journey to the West) where he transforms once more into Chin\u2010Kee, the embodiment of Danny's otherwise marginalised Chinese American identity.",

When the teacher tells the class that Wei\u2010Chen is from China, he asserts that he is from Taiwan. The scene doubles the panel in which Jin is introduced to the class and corrects the teacher by asserting that he is from San Francisco, not China. Jin feels an immediate and inexplicable desire to bully Wei\u2010Chen when they first meet. Jin's instant dislike of Wei\u2010Chen reflects both his racial self\u2010hatred and the question, Doughty contends, of Taiwan's political status. Like every other Asian identity in the text, Wei\u2010Chen's Taiwanese identity is not fixed. After Jin makes a failed attempt to kiss Suzy, Wei\u2010Chen's anger is exacerbated by his belief that he and Jin are family. The scene, Doughty contends, reverses the argument often made by certain voices in mainland China that the majority of people who reside in Taiwan and mainland China share a common ancestry.",

In contrast to Song, I read Wei\u2010Chen's transformation as taike, a specifically Taiwanese style of excessive dress (Smith 2013, online). Wei\u2010Chen adopts a deliberately non\u2010American Asian identity. His street racer/taike identity is supported by his refusal to speak in English. Cheney contends that Wei\u2010Chen takes on the trappings of American Hip Hop culture and thus a style of dress which is more commonly associated with certain African American, rather than Asian American, cultures. Cheney asserts that Wei\u2010Chen's Hip Hop accessories serve to emphasise the degree to which his identity is a performance.

If understood as a totalising statement, it is hard to reconcile Gardner's argument with images of Captain America doing battle with Middle Eastern terrorists in the Enemy arc (Cassaday and Rieber 2002a), a fight which is clearly founded upon concepts of \u2018us and them\u2019 and supported with racist cartoon language. It is also hard to make a case that second\u2010generation Shoah survivor Art Spiegelman's satirical entries for the 2002 Iranian Anti\u2010Semitic cartoon competition fail to complicate racist editorial cartoons because he uses single static images rather than a series of static images (see Spiegelman 2011, 102\u2013103).",

The irony of Yang's postmodern play with older literary forms may be lost on a readership who have had little exposure to the works he references. A younger audience might read Chin\u2010Kee as an unironic depiction of mainland Chinese (see Dong 2011, 241).

Chin\u2010Kee's presence in Danny's life (and in the text as a whole) illustrates the damage which these stereotypes wreak in the lives of Asian Americans. For Fu and Vizzini, it is the racism of the White characters which is most deserving of attention: \u2018[m]ore disquieting than Chin\u2010Kee himself is the reaction of his American peers. They accept him with blank, idealized political correctness.\u2019 (Vizzini 2007, online). The most harmful violence depicted in the text is not the exaggerated racist caricature Chin\u2010Kee but Danny's classmates who make squinty eyes at when the Asian characters look away. Dong asserts that \u2018[t]he very first morning, though well intentioned, [Jin's] teacher mispronounces his name, misidentifies his origin, and promotes stereotypes about people of Chinese heritage\u2019 (Dong 2011, 238). The Asian American characters arrange their identities around this racism. Danny, Davis argues, is \u2018haunted by the (literal) spectre of the Asian stereotype\u2019 (Davis 2011, 280). American Born Chinese alerts readers to the ways in which racism has become something performed in whispers to one side or hidden behind a veneer of political correctness and betrayed by slips of speech. The damage of such stereotypes is not that they are used as a weapon against ethnic minorities but that they may be internalised by members of those groups. Jin, Davis argues, \u2018is a victim of the pervasiveness of racial stereotypes; he suffers from the consequences of their existence at the same time that he accepts them\u2019 (Davis 2011, 280).
