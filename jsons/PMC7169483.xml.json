These parameters are important for the applications of these nanomaterials in vaccines.1 Vaccines represent one of the most effective and least costly means for the prevention and control of human diseases. For certain diseases that have no cure because the pathogen integrates its own genetic material into its host, vaccination may represent the only possible means of the fight against these pathogens. One such example is HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). Human beings, however, have only limited access to effective vaccination. Many serious diseases still have no effective vaccines, for instance, HIV, HCV (hepatitis C virus), lung cancer, and mad cow disease.2, 3, 4, 5 Nanomaterials have brought new hopes for people with diseases that currently lack effective vaccines. The unique properties of nanomaterials can improve vaccines in a number of ways, including enhancing the immunity of the vaccine, improving biosafety, and optimizing immunization routes.6 However, the detailed molecular working mechanisms are still largely unknown, and few studies focus on investigating the relationship between the physiochemical characteristics of nanomaterials and their bio\u2010effects in vivo. Herein, we provide examples of selected studies that show practical applications and working mechanisms of multiple nanomaterials in the field of vaccines. By summarizing six different chemical compositions of nanomaterials\u2014i.e., peptide backbones, carbon, gold, silver, calcium, and polymers\u2014this review shows the diverse biological effects of these materials for regulating immune responses of vaccines based on their various physical characteristics (size, shape, aspect ratio, and so forth) and biochemical modifications (Table\n\n1\n and Table\n\n2\n). This review also analyzes how these materials work via targeting and affecting major components in the immune system, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and T and B cells, to shape the eventual profiles of the immunity of vaccines (Figure\n\n1\n).",

This vector could result in a balanced immune response (strong antibody secretion, IFN\u2010\u03b3 and IL\u20104 secreting lymphocyte production, all of which play crucial roles in the preventiion of the infection and controlling the in vivo spread of HIV). It was rarely seen in other adjuvants or delivery systems, and is considered to be crucial for protecting human beings from HIV infection. A comprehensive analysis of the safety of this nanovector showed that it was non\u2010toxic in the long\u2010term study and could completely degrade within 21 days in vivo. Such a property might facilitate its eventual clinical application. The reason for the impressive efficacy of this nanovector is that this hydrogel can form left\u2010handed nanofibers which can bind with and package DNA, and doing so allows the DNA to enter host cells [this process was characterized and confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), circular dichroism (CD), and optical microscopy].6 Moreover, such nanomaterials are also convenient for preparation under mild, common laboratory conditions. Such properties further increase the likelihood that this kind of material will be used as the vector for HIV vaccines. More importantly, unlike peptide vaccines which only present linear epitopes to the host, DNA vaccines can eventually express 3D structural proteins in host cells. Nanofibers may therefore be better for presenting the conformational antigen epitopes. It is crucial to induce the production of neutralizing antibodies, which depend on the spatial conformation of the antigen, thus preventing infections from pathogens.41, 42\n",

This Q11 assembly itself could be degraded rapidly and excreted from the injection site to avoid potential inflammation.44 In another study, nanofibers based on Q11 succeeded in presenting the antigen epitopes and significantly improving antibody responses against malaria.45 These studies show that using peptide\u2010based nanofibers can significantly improve the efficacy of vaccines.",

            "text": "Actually, the bioeffects of nanomaterials for regulating immune responses are affected by multiple factors, including chemical composition, physical characteristics, and biochemical modifications. In particular, the bioeffects of peptide\u2010based nanomaterials are mainly influenced by the shape characteristics, when they are used as vectors to optimize the efficacy of vaccines. Fibers are the most common form. Such a structure is very helpful for enhancing the uptake of antigen\u2010presentation cells against their targets loaded on fibers. Compared with peptide\u2010based nanomaterials, non\u2010peptide polymer and carbon nanomaterials not only possess obviously more possible shapes (ball, tube, stick, sheet, and others) and sizes within the nanoscale scope, but also are easier to chemically or biologically modify (such as adjusting charge and CpG) on the nanomaterial surface. They also therefore exhibit even more varied and complicated functions. Metal materials, such as gold and silver, are convenient to be prepared into various controllable shapes and sizes. By some surface modification, like poly(diallydimethylammonium chloride) (PDDAC) and polyethyleneimine (PEI), these materials are endowed with novel immunoregulation effects, including promoting the maturation of dendritic cells, increasing cytokine secretion, and enhancing antibody titers. The antigens encapsulated by calcium\u2010based nanoparticles are not only more effectively taken up by the host, but they also prevent antigens from degradation and damage by the in vivo conditions. Meanwhile, such carriers also can slowly release antigens as a harbor, producing long\u2010term immunostimulation and inducing potent memory immunity. Although the biological effects of other kinds of nanomaterials are not mentioned in this review, their underlying immunregulation actions are still worth deeper investigation. Such studies on uncovering the relationships between physiochemical characteristics and biological effects of nanomaterials would bring us many amazing guidelines for the design of vaccines. At present, in view of the fact that immunoregulation effects of nanomaterials are so far difficult to reproducibly predict based on their physicochemical characteristics, large\u2010scale screening is still a necessary means to comprehensively evaluate the biological function of nanomaterials in the next studies.",

            "text": "However, compared with some existing methodologies, nanomaterials possess many unique advantages. For example, the conventional vaccine vector, virus\u2010based vector, can express genes of antigens in a high\u2010efficacy way and trigger potent antigen\u2010specific immune responses. However, the applications of these vectors are limited greatly (usually only can be immunized once) because of anti\u2010vector antibody responses induced by the vectors themselves. Moreover, the complexity of element genes within virus vectors which would modulate immune responses probably brings people some unpredictable consequences. For example, Merck II phage clinical trials of HIV vaccine, in which one kind of adenovirus vector (Adv5) was used as vector, showed a higher infection ratio of HIV in group which received vaccine immunization, suggesting the unsafe aspects of application of virus vectors.142 For traditional emulsions or waters which are used as vaccine adjuvants (Freund's adjuvant, LPS), their serious side\u2010effects hinder their further applications in clinical trials.143 In contrast, nanomaterials hardly induce antibodies against themselves because of their poor immunogenicity. Their small size and appropriate surface functionalization allow them to be excreted easily, therefore ensuring their good biosafety for in vivo applications.",

It is certainly useful for broadening vaccine\u2010based prophylaxis and therapy against diseases in the future. Moreover, the structure and surface modification of the nanomaterials might be changed when they enter a body because of their bindings with proteins in vivo. Such changes should be the subject of intense investigations in the future.
