            "text": "Lung transplantation is a viable treatment option for end-stage lung disease. Common indications for lung transplantation are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Other less common indications include end-stage sarcoidosis, lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis/granulomatosis (PLCH/G), and other interstitial lung diseases. Either single or bilateral lung transplantation can be performed. Bilateral transplantation is required for patients with suppurative lung diseases including cystic fibrosis and most patients with PAH. While suitable outcomes may be achieved with single lung transplantation for other diagnoses, there is a trend in recent years for use of bilateral transplantation, largely related to a suggestion of better long-term survival seen in registry data [1]. Specifically, according to the 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) registry report, the median survival for all adult recipients is 5.7 years, but bilateral lung recipients appear to have a better median survival than single lung recipients (7 versus 4.5 years, respectively) [1]. Overall survival after lung transplantation has improved due to refinement in surgical technique, improvement in organ procurement and preserving techniques, and advances in medical management and immunosuppression. The most common cause of mortality in first 30 days after lung transplantation is primary graft dysfunction. Infection is the most common cause of mortality in the first 6 months and chronic rejection thereafter [1].",

Native lung volume reduction surgery performed at the time of, or after, transplantation may help prevent this complication [3].\n",

Existing pleural abnormalities before lung transplantation can predispose to pleural complications. For instance, pleural infection or inflammation can result from end-stage lung diseases for which lung transplantation is required such as cystic fibrosis. Invasive procedures required to diagnose (wedge biopsy) or treat (pleurodesis or pleural drain for pneumothorax or pleural effusion) end-stage lung disease may result in pleural abnormalities. Pneumothorax is the most common pleural complication [7] (Fig. 19.4a, b). Airway anastomotic complications should be suspected if pneumothorax persists or enlarges after the early postoperative period (>7 days after transplantation). Pleural effusion is also a common complication secondary to increased capillary permeability and impaired lymphatic drainage of the allograft lung during the early postoperative period (Fig. 19.5a, b). Pleural fluid in the immediate postoperative period is often hemorrhagic and becomes progressively less hemorrhagic by 7 days. Pleural effusion usually resolves by 2 weeks. Persistent or enlarging pleural effusion should raise suspicion for empyema or left heart failure. Hemothorax usually results from surgical complications (Fig. 19.6a, b). Persistent air leak, empyema, and hemothorax are associated with increased mortality and should be promptly recognized and managed [7, 8].\n\n\n",

It is a major factor limiting the long-term survival in lung transplant recipients. It usually occurs 6 months after transplantation, and risk factors include prior episodes of recurrent acute rejection or infections, particularly CMV pneumonia. Obliterative bronchiolitis is the most common histologic pattern seen in BOS and manifests as eosinophilic hyaline fibrosis in respiratory bronchiolar walls with luminal occlusion [20]. Due to patchy distribution of the disease, transbronchial biopsy may be negative. In such cases diagnosis is made clinically on the basis of otherwise unexplained, persistent decrease in FEV1 indicative of small airway disease. Pulmonary function tests classically show an obstructive pattern, but combined obstruction and restriction may be seen [21]. High-resolution CT shows bronchial wall thickening, bronchiectasis, and heterogeneous areas of hyperlucent (dark) interspersed with adjacent normal lung parenchyma (mosaic attenuation) that is accentuated in exhalation images. Thus, it is very important to obtain paired inspiratory and expiratory HRCT images when chronic rejection is suspected clinically. On expiration HRCT, normal lung parenchyma becomes greyer, and hyperlucent (pathologic) lung remains dark indicating air trapping (Figs. 19.19a, b and 19.20a, b). Thus, the differentiation between normal and abnormal lung becomes more pronounced on expiration CT [13, 22].\n\n",

It is characterized by the presence of inflammatory granulation tissues within the alveoli, alveolar sacs, and ducts. It responds rapidly to high-dose corticosteroids. Bronchoscopy is often done to exclude infection before starting on high-dose corticosteroids. CT shows peripheral, peribronchovascular, or perilobular consolidation (Fig. 19.21). Frequently, peripheral arc-like consolidation with central ground-glass opacity (reverse halo/atoll sign) is seen [15, 24].\n",

It typically manifests within 1 year after transplantation but can be seen from 1 month to several years after transplantation. PTLD risk is increased significantly in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) seronegative recipients receiving lungs from seropositive donors. The other major risk factor is augmented immunosuppression. Incidence varies between 2.8 and 6% at 1 year after transplantation [25, 26]. It is more common with lung transplantation than with other solid organ transplantation. The majority of cases of PTLD is of B cell origin and associated with EBV primary infection. A much smaller proportion of PTLDs are of T cell origin, Hodgkin\u2019s type, or, rarely, plasma cell type such as multiple myeloma. These categories are more likely to be EBV-negative. EBV-associated PTLD presents early (within 1 year), usually has a benign course and is intrathoracic, whereas EBV-negative PTLD presents late (median onset 50\u201360 months post-transplant), generally more aggressive and extrathoracic. Early disease responds to antiviral therapy and reduction in immunosuppression. Late disease generally requires chemotherapy and radiation therapy [25]. CT shows solitary or multiple nodules with peripheral and basal predominant distribution (Figs. 19.22a, b and 19.23a, b). Mass-like consolidation and mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy are also commonly seen. Rarely, interlobular septal thickening can be seen. Pleural and chest wall masses with or without pleural effusion and/or pericardial effusion have been described [27, 28]. Biopsy is often needed to differentiate PTLD from infection [29, 30].\n\n",
