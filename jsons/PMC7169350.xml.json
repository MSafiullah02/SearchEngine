            "text": "An adequate volume of blood for hematologic and biochemical analysis is best obtained from the jugular vein. A docile animal may be restrained in a standing position or tipped up (sheep only) with the head turned away from the jugular vein to be used. Wilder ones, such as some cervids, may require restraint devices or chemical sedation. Ideally, the animal should be restrained by someone other than the blood collector, although the same person may be able to both restrain a sheep and collect blood if the animal is tipped up or a halter is used (see Chapter 1). The animal should be at rest, with minimal excitement. The collector parts or clips the wool or hair to visualize the jugular vein and then uses the hand not holding the needle to apply digital pressure proximally just above the thoracic inlet to block blood movement through the vein. The vessel may take a second or more to distend after pressure is applied. The collector may then use the needle-bearing hand to \u201cstrum\u201d the vessel and cause the blood to oscillate. If in doubt about whether the distended vessel is the jugular vein, the collector can release the hand placing pressure on the vessel and observe whether the distended vessel disappears; if it does, the distended vessel was probably the jugular vein. The collector should avoid vessels that pulsate because these are likely to be the carotid arteries. The area should be cleaned with alcohol or other disinfectant, water, or a clean, dry gauze sponge. An 18- or 20-gauge, 1- to 1.5-inch needle is usually adequate to collect blood from an adult, whereas a 22-gauge needle may be used in a neonate. The skin of adults or males may be thicker and more difficult to penetrate with the needle. A syringe or evacuated tube attached to a Vacutainer (Becton Dickinson Inc., Rutherford, NJ) can be used to collect blood. The needle should be plunged through the skin into the vein at an approximate 30-degree angle. The blood should not come out of the vessel in pulsatile waves; this is suggestive of an arterial stick. After aseptically obtaining an adequate volume of blood, the collector removes the needle and releases the pressure on the vessel near the thoracic inlet. Pressure should be applied to the site of puncture for a minute or more to prevent extravascular leakage of blood and hematoma formation. The blood should be carefully transferred to a vial containing the appropriate anticoagulant to prevent red blood cell (RBC) rupture. Goat erythrocytes are small and particularly prone to hemolysis. To minimize this problem, goat blood should be collected with a needle and syringe, not a Vacutainer. White blood cell (WBC) differential distribution, individual blood cell staining characteristics, and morphology may be assessed by microscopic examination of a stained blood film. The differential distribution provides more information than total WBC count because inflammatory conditions in artiodactyls often result in a shift in neutrophil populations toward more degenerate, toxic, or immature forms without changing the overall WBC count.1 The preferred anticoagulant for a complete blood count (CBC) is ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA), and tubes should be filled to ensure the proper blood-to-anticoagulant ratio. Blood samples should be processed as soon as possible after collection. If a delay is anticipated, the blood sample should be refrigerated (4\u00b0 C) and an air-dried blood smear should be made because prolonged contact of blood with EDTA causes changes in WBC morphology and the separation of some RBC parasites. Blood can be refrigerated for 24 hours and still yield an accurate CBC.",

            "text": "Bone marrow aspirates and core biopsy samples taken from sites of active erythropoiesis can be useful to evaluate erythrocyte production and determine the cause of anemia and other hemogram abnormalities. The sites of biopsy include the sternebrae, femur, and ileum. The procedure should be done under chemical sedation or anesthesia (see Chapter 18). The area over the biopsy site is clipped and surgically prepared; the sampler should wear sterile gloves to maintain asepsis. Aspirates can be obtained by inserting a sterile needle attached to a 3- or 6-cc syringe containing one or two drops of EDTA through the bone and into the bone marrow. Drawing back on the syringe plunger several times may aid in the procurement of an acceptable sample; such a sample may consist of as little as 0.5 mL of bone marrow. If the sample is going to be processed immediately, no anticoagulant is required. Core biopsies are obtained using a Jamshidi or Westerman-Jensen biopsy needle. The skin is incised with a scalpel and the biopsy needle is inserted into the bone and turned several times to obtain a core sample. More than one site may be used. The sampler then closes the skin with sutures or staples. Biopsy samples are preserved by placing them in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution. Impression smears can be made from these samples by gently rolling them on a clean glass slide before placing them in the formalin solution. Information obtained from bone marrow samples includes subjective data regarding cell density, megakaryocyte numbers, abnormal cells, maturation patterns of RBCs and WBCs, and the ratio of erythroid to myeloid cells. Prussian blue stain can be used on bone marrow to demonstrate iron stores. Bone marrow aspirates and biopsies are painful and invasive procedures. Therefore, animals should be placed on antibiotics and antiinflammatory drugs prophylactically.\n",

            "text": "Blood cultures can be useful in diagnosing bacteremia in an intermittently or persistently febrile animal or one with numerous sites of organ infection. Ideally, the clinician should obtain the sample before instituting antimicrobial therapy. However, if this is impossible, antimicrobial therapy should be discontinued 48 to 72 hours before sampling. Samples should be taken before and during febrile episodes. The jugular vein is most commonly used to attain a blood culture. As described previously, the skin over the jugular vein should be clipped and surgically prepared. The person collecting the blood sample should wear sterile gloves and use a sterile needle and syringe. Blood samples should be placed immediately in a blood culture flask. The chances of attaining a positive culture from bacteremic animals increase with the size of the sample up to about 30 mL, but adding more than the recommended amount to any single culture vial may overwhelm the capacity of the specialized antibiotic-absorbing resins within the flasks. The clinician should change the needle on the sample syringe after collecting the blood and before putting the sample in the culture medium. Samples should be refrigerated until they can be sent to a diagnostic laboratory, where aerobic and sometimes anaerobic cultures are made.",

Similar to body condition scoring systems, it is essential to calibrate assessors to ensure consistency when using this system.7 Also, some breeds read differently on the cards, and use of an electronic color analyzer, while more expensive and less field-friendly, may detect anemia earlier (see Chapter 6, Figure 6.4A, B, and Chapter 19).8 Easy use of this technique in deer is limited by their intractability and has not been reported.",

If the animal survives the peracute disease, neutropenia should resolve over 3 to 4 days, first through an increase in immature cells, and later through a mature neutrophilic response.

Additionally, ewes with higher BCS (> 2.75) tended to produce higher volumes of colostrum compared with ewes with lower BCS.32 Another study suggested that undernutrition of ewes during late gestation can affect colostrum quality and immune development and function in newborn lambs.33 It has been suggested that at least 30 g of total IgG should be fed to newborn lambs and kids during the first 24 hours of life to reach adequate transfer of passive immunity. Adequate transfer of passive immunity in small ruminant neonates has been suggested as serum IgG levels at 24 hours of life of \u2265 15 mg/mL. One study indicated that lambs that nurse low-quality colostrum (IgG < 30 mg/mL) had lower serum IgG concentrations compared with lambs that that nurse colostrum of higher quality (IgG > 110 mg/mL), indicating that the concentration of IgG in colostrum is a determining factor for the presentation of failure in the transfer of passive immunity.34 Other factors such as pregnancy toxemia, gastrointestinal parasitism, excess of iodine intake during pregnancy, and inadequate vaccination of the dam can result in poor colostrum synthesis and quality.35\n",

In small ruminants, cells of the small intestine are able to internalize and transfer IgG into the blood during the first 24 hours of life; however, the absorption efficiency of IgG is higher during the first 6 to 12 hours of life.32\n,\n36 Factors associated with the neonate, such as weakness, inability to stand, and congenital abnormalities, will prevent timely nursing of maternal colostrum and lead to failure of passive transfer (FPT). Litter size and body weight (BW) of the kid(s) have also been correlated with inadequate absorption of IgG from colostrum. One study demonstrated that litter sizes of three light goat kids (< 2.8 kg BW) or more had significantly lower mean serum IgG levels at 24 hours of life when compared with litter sizes of one or two heavier kids (9.85 versus 18.30 mg/mL, respectively).37 This suggests that special attention and monitoring should be paid to multiple fetus gestation as the risk of FPT under these circumstances at kidding is higher; however, the quality of colostrum, amount ingested, and adequacy of absorption are rarely monitored by small ruminant producers in natural or artificial rearing systems. The use of monitoring tools to evaluate colostrum quality and IgG absorption is common in modern dairy cattle operations, and these tools are readily available for small ruminant production systems. Recent reports have presented the use of %Brix in maternal colostrum and neonate serum and its positive correlation with serum total proteins (STPs) at 24 hours as effective monitoring tools of FPT in lambs and goat kids.38., 39., 40. The use of STP has also been used to monitor colostrum deficiency intake in mule deer fawns41; however, adequate values of serum IgG for cervid neonates have not been established yet.\n",

The amount of colostrum absorbed across the gut decreases with time, especially in animals that have been ingesting other proteins (e.g., the casein in milk); it also decreases with illnesses that decrease gastrointestinal function. Neonatal small ruminants should receive at least 4 g of IgG/kg of BW or ideally 30 g of total mass of IgG from a good-quality colostrum source (> 50 mg/mL of IgG) during the first hours of life.32 Other authors recommend an intake of 180 to 210 mL of colostrum/kg during the first 18 hours of life.46 In artificial rearing systems or lamb feedlots, feeding of colostrum every 6 hours until 24 hours of life is recommended.47 When same species\u2019 maternal colostrum is unavailable, goat colostrum or bovine colostrum/colostrum replacers or are a good alternative; however, hemolysis has been reported in lambs receiving cattle colostrum.48 One study demonstrated that there was no difference in serum IgG levels of lambs that received the same volume of sheep or goat colostrum at birth.47 Another study demonstrated that lambs that received 250 mL of a bovine colostrum replacer at birth in addition to 250 mL of stored sheep colostrum at 6 hours of life had higher serum %Brix values at 24 hours and had less incidence of disease during the preweaning period compared with lambs that received the same volume of stored sheep colostrum at birth and at 6 hours of life.38 Since IgG absorption cannot be extended more than 24 hours after birth, administration of an oral colostrum source is the best treatment in the immediate postpartum period in still-healthy neonates. After the window for immunoglobulin absorption has closed, plasma, serum, or whole blood administered by the IV or intra-peritoneal route is the best way to raise the neonate\u2019s blood immunoglobulin concentrations. Adult donor plasma contains approximately 2.5 to 3.5 g of immunoglobulin/dL, so administration of a volume equivalent to 10% of BW or a dose of 20 to 40 mL/kg has been recommended for the treatment of large animal neonates. If plasma is used instead of colostrum, administration of vitamins A, D, and E also may be beneficial.",

Administration of vaccines 6 weeks before parturition, followed in 2 weeks with a booster, provides the highest quantity of protective immunoglobulin in the colostrum. Antepartum leakage is rarely the problem in small ruminants that it is in horses and cattle. However, in a flock or herd environment, still-pregnant dams may steal babies from other sheep or goats. To prevent such theft and the resultant loss of colostrum by the \u201cadopted\u201d neonate, owners may choose to keep pregnant animals separate from those that have already delivered. If complete separation is not possible, the dam and her offspring should be allowed to bond with each other in a private pen (\u201cjug\u201d or \u201ccrate\u201d) for at least 24 hours before being placed back with the flock.

With recent advances in diagnostics and metagenomics of the enteric environment of large animals, novel viruses have been identified as potential causal agents of diarrhea in lambs and goat kids. Adenovirus, Astrovirus, Calicivirus, Coronavirus, and Picornavirus have been identified in feces of diarrheic lambs and goat kids55; however, their role in the pathogenesis of neonatal diarrhea is still uncertain. These organisms differ from the agents of complicated diarrhea in that they do not invade beyond the gut wall or result in systemic toxemia (see Chapter 5). Additional causes of diarrhea reported in goat kids and elk include lactose intolerance and hypernatremia, respectively.49\n,\n50 Less frequently, bacteria such as C. perfringens, Clostridium difficile, and attaching and effacing E. coli have been associated with complicated diarrhea in small ruminant neonates.54\n,\n56\n",

Therefore, these problems are best treated in animals showing signs of dehydration with the administration of a balanced, physiologic electrolyte solution. Metabolic acidosis usually is accompanied by either obvious evidence of bicarbonate loss (diarrhea) or severe dehydration. However, neither of these conditions is present with floppy kid syndrome. This descriptive title is applied to muscle weakness, anorexia, and depression in kids observed in the first 2 weeks of life. By its strictest definition, floppy kid syndrome refers to metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap without dehydration or any known cause in young kids that were normal at birth. A variety of disorders and conditions have been proposed as the cause of metabolic acidosis without dehydration, including intestinal fermentation of milk in well-fed kids with subsequent absorption of volatile fatty acids, transient neonatal renal tubular acidosis, and lactic acidosis secondary to toxic impairment of cardiovascular function. Overgrowth of C. perfringens type A often is suggested as a source of the toxin. With a high anion gap, a pathologic condition that leads to overproduction of an organic acid is more likely than one that leads to bicarbonate loss. The disease can occur in individual animals or in outbreaks; although parity of the dam and number of offspring have not been associated with this metabolic disturbance, aggressively feeding kids are more likely to suffer from milk fermentation or clostridial overgrowth. An infectious etiology appears to be more likely in herds displaying an increased incidence of this metabolic disturbances as the kidding season progresses. The disease also is reported to be more common in meat goats than in dairy goats. The prevalence can vary tremendously from year to year in a single flock or region.

The major effect of the phospholipase/sphingomyelinase CPA, produced by all C. perfringens biotypes, is cell lysis and hemolysis, and its role on intestinal disease of large animals is not well understood. However, this toxin has been associated with hemolytic disease and hemorrhagic enteritis in large animals; CPB, produced by C. perfringens types B and C, is a trypsin-labile toxin associated with necrotizing enteritis and enterotoxemia in large animal neonates; ETX, produced by C. perfringens types D and B, is a trypsin-activated necrotizing toxin associated to vasculitis, edema, and necrosis of the CNS and enterotoxemia; and ITX, another trypsin-activated necrotizing toxin produced by C. perfringens type E, has also been associated to intestinal disease in small ruminants.64\n,\n65\nC. perfringens types C and D are considered the most important types in veterinary medicine as they can cause disease in most farm animals.66 Severe clinical disease due to bacteria sporulation and massive toxin production only occurs when the normal intestinal environment and microbial balance are disrupted in affected individuals. Decreased peristalsis and poor ruminal and abomasal function have also been proposed as factors that contribute to disease presentation. Weather and handling stresses, feed changes, and an overabundance of high-energy feeds such as milk, bakery products, and cereal grains might promote bacteria overgrowth and exotoxin synthesis and release. Additionally, other enteric infections that disrupt the mucosal border may increase systemic absorption of toxins and promote severe disease.\n",

Similar to C. novyi B, C. haemolyticum colonizes the livers of healthy animals and proliferates after liver damage, including damage caused by migrating flukes (F. hepatica, Fascioloides magna, Dicrocoelium dendriticum, and C. tenuicollis), liver abscessation (Fusobacterium necrophorum or Trueperella pyogenes), or damage incurred during liver biopsy.100\n,\n103 Under ischemic conditions of the liver, spores of C. haemolyticum germinate and produce high amounts of beta toxin. The beta toxin causes localized hepatic necrosis and after reaching circulation induces severe intravascular hemolysis and damage of the capillary endothelium.103 Intravascular hemolysis leads to rapid anemia and death due to anoxia. The disease is seen worldwide and is more commonly reported in sheep than in goats.

In sheep and goats, this disease has been reported following lambing/kidding, after shearing of tail docking.100\nC. septicum can also invade the abomasal lining of lambs, causing severe hemorrhagic, necrotic abomasitis known as braxy.108 Activation of dormant bacteria in previously damaged tissue (myositis/abomasitis) similar to that seen in clostridial necrotic hepatitis also occurs.108 In both cases (malignant edema and braxy), bacterial toxins precipitate local tissue necrosis and systemic toxemia. The alpha, beta, gamma, and delta toxins produced by C. septicum are lecithinase, deoxyribonuclease, hyaluronidase, and hemolysin, respectively. Commonly affected sites of malignant edema include castration, dehorning, and injection sites; the umbilicus; and the postpartum uterus.100 Factors that promote braxy have not been identified, although it usually affects weaned and yearling lambs in the winter after ingestion of frozen feedstuffs implicated as initial causes of abomasitis.100\n,\n108 Both forms of the disease have worldwide distribution and are described more in sheep than in goats.100\n,\n108\n",

C. sordelli tends to be involved in the myonecrosis of older feedlot animals.112 These organisms are found in the soil and can gain access to muscles after translocation from the gastrointestinal tract and liver into systemic circulation. Additionally, direct inoculation of the organisms by penetrating wounds or intramuscular injections has been suggested. Local tissue trauma, wounds, unsanitary procedures (i.e., shearing, tail docking, and castration), umbilical infection (neonates), or vaginal trauma from lambing can create perfect conditions for the germination of clostridial spores inducing rapid toxin synthesis and production.113 In some cases, bacterial proliferation appears to occur in a site distant from the original wound (i.e., fetal infections after shearing of a ewe and myocardial necrosis in cattle and sheep).113 Bacterial toxins cause severe local tissue necrosis, systemic toxemia, and ultimately death. As with braxy, several other strains of tissue-invasive clostridia can cause this disease and mixed infections are common.",

Head and neck lesions are more common in goats, whereas sheep have a more even distribution of cranial and caudal lesions, presumably as a result of shearing wounds. External infections rarely cause clinical illness beyond the draining abscess, although some degree of cachexia may be present.\n",

Examination of the buffy coat of centrifuged blood with darkfield phase-contrast spore illumination is the most sensitive direct microscopic method and is useful when parasite numbers are low. Pathogenic trypanosomes must be distinguished from more ubiquitous, nonpathogenic species particularly common in cattle, such as Trypanosoma theileri.

In contrast, in the acute form of the disease, the clinical signs of the peracute form are accompanied with bleeding throughout body tissues (Figure 16.1\nA, B). Ulcers may be evident in the oral cavity and throughout the upper gastrointestinal tract, forestomachs, and abomasum. Case fatality rates are high for both the peracute and acute forms. Deer that recover after several weeks of illness are said to suffer from the chronic form of the disease. Signs of previous illness may include breaks or rings in the hoof horn due to interrupted growth and synthesis leading to lameness, sometimes severe. Ulceration and scarring of the rumen and gastrointestinal tract may result in loss of body condition despite a seemingly normal appetite and ample nutrition. Widespread evidence of vasculitis may be observed histopathologically.",

Contaminated feed and water also are potential routes of infection and should not be shared among infected and uninfected animals. Serologic testing and separation or culling of seropositive animals may help reduce infection. Although OPPV can readily be isolated from ewe colostrum, colostral transmission of OPPV has not been definitively established. However, many prevention guidelines recommend that offspring from infected dams be separated from the dam before they nurse and then be fed cow colostrum and artificially reared. Quarantine and serologic testing of flock additions before placing them with the current flock and purchase of sheep only from OPPV-free flocks are important to prevent the introduction of new infections. Because of the potential cross-species spread, all precautions taken for sheep also apply to contact goats. Serologic testing should be performed at least annually in a flock until two consecutive negative test results are obtained.",

In the absence of these hormones, a resultant lowered concentration of a specific nucleotide in the central nervous system also contributes to the hypomyelination. The third factor is altered immune function. The virus causes the host to produce a virus-specific delayed hypersensitivity reaction that causes inflammation in the central nervous system.

Clinical signs also may vary in severity from animal to animal because different fetuses develop competent immune systems at different times. If the fetus or embryo is exposed to the virus within 45 days of conception, it dies and is resorbed or aborted. These losses are not usually noticed by the flock manager. The principal manifestation in the flock is a large number of open ewes and a small lamb crop. Infection of the fetus between days 45 and 80 of gestation causes damage to rapidly growing systems such as the skin and nervous, lymphoid, thyroid, and skeletal systems. Congenital malformations are seen at birth. Lambs have abnormal fleece characteristics (hairy rather than woolly in consistency), small stature, domed heads, shortened legs, and dark pigmentation of the skin, particularly on the dorsal aspect of the neck. The lamb may exhibit tonic-clonic tremors (\u201chairy shakers\u201d) when awake, which may prevent standing or suckling. Most of these lambs die within a few days of birth. If they survive, the hair changes disappear in 9 to 12 weeks and the central nervous system signs resolve by 20 weeks. Goats infected at this time have similar symptoms except that they rarely exhibit hair coat changes. If kids are infected before day 80 of gestation and are still viable, they may become persistently infected and immunologically compromised. They are small at birth and generally weak.",
