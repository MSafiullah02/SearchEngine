Together, 10.5% of discharged patients showed virus shredding around an average of 4.7 days after discharge (range, 2-13 days). Under scenario 3, the logistic regression models revealed that a high risk of positive test was significantly associated with older age (OR, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93\u22120.98), diarrhea during hospital stage (OR, 10.44; 95% CI, 1.60\u221268.16).
