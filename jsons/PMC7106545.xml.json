Nevertheless, it has been recognized as a cause of adult ARI, especially in the elderly, those with comorbidities, and immunocompromised hosts, which leads to hospitalization and increases morbidity and mortality [1,[4], [5], [6], [7], [8]]. The prevalence of RSV infection in adults varies from 3% to 13% depending on age groups, underlying diseases, diagnostic techniques, study periods, and geographic regions.[3], [4], [5],[7], [8], [9]], In addition, disease severity ranges from mild to severe acute respiratory illness [4]. A total of 4%\u201316% of adult patients with RSV infection required hospitalization [3,4,10], with high complications including cardiopulmonary complications and mortality [4,5,8,11]. There were a few data of adult hospitalized patients with RSV infection, with high complications, in Thailand; [3,12,13] however, additional clinical data are required for planning patient management and also disease prevention in this region.",

Pneumonia was diagnosed if patients had fever, cough, and dyspnea with new pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography. Acute bronchitis was defined as an acute respiratory infection manifested predominantly by cough without pneumonia, common cold, or exacerbation of asthma or COPD [14]. Chest radiography was independently interpreted by two chest radiologists who did not know the clinical course of patients. If the results were discordant, the consensus was made after the discussion. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) was defined as pneumonia that developed 48 h or more after admission without endotracheal intubation. Ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP) was defined as pneumonia that developed more than 48 h after endotracheal intubation [15,16]. COPD exacerbation was defined as a sustained worsening of the COPD patients\u2019 condition beyond normal day-to-day variations, acute onset and necessitates a change in regular medication [17]. Asthma exacerbation was defined by changes in symptoms and rescue use, which were outside the patients\u2019 usual range of day-to-day variation [18]. Worsening or new congestive heart failure were diagnosed by cardiologists based on clinical signs, laboratory investigation such as chest radiography and echocardiography.",

            "text": "Cardiovascular complications were found in 24.6% of patients including both worsening and new onset CHF, acute MI, new AF and SVT, and 52.9% of them had pre-existing cardiovascular diseases. The prevalence of cardiovascular complications in adult RSV infection had been reported in 14.3%\u201322.0% of patients [6,11]. A risk of overall cardiovascular complications in our study was pre-existing coronary arterial disease (CAD) with adjusted odds ratio 6.18, (95% CI 1.18\u201332.5), p =  0.03. In addition, we found that acute MI was the second cause of death. These supported the importance of cardiovascular complications in adult hospitalized patients with RSV infection. Patients with cardiovascular disease have higher rates of health care utilization for RSV-related illness and worse outcomes [29].",

Adult severe pneumonia can occur in other viruses including human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and coronavirus [5,10,31]. More studies of respiratory viral infections in adult patients are needed to identify the incidence and the impact of these viruses in Thailand. The mechanisms of these severe diseases in the elderly are not clear. However, the experimental studies in aged mice infected with RSV and/or HMPV demonstrated that CD4 + T lymphocytes, the cytokine response, or a defect in humoral response may be associated with the severity in this population [32,33].",
