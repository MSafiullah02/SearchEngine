It is characterized by respiratory and nervous signs, bleeding lesions in the digestive system and mild infections in the respiratory system. Newcastle Disease is a single-stranded RNA virus that threatens poultry health and causes great economic losses (Nidzworski et al., 2013). Newcastle Disease causes a very fatal disease in chickens classified under a single avian paramyxo virus serotype 1 (APMV-1). NDV shows a spectrum of virulence, with strains in NDV, causing infection (lentogenic strains). It shows moderate virulence (mesogenic strains), and exhibits very high virulence (velogenic strains), and the velogenic strains cause 100% mortality (Alexander, 2001, Capua and Alexander, 2009).",

(2009) designed an automated system to detect and classify calls of nine frogs and three bird species (Acevedo et al., 2009). Gutierrez et al. (2010) classified porcine wasting diseases of pigs using sound analysis and labeling method. Pig\u2019s cough were recorded by microphone and the sound\u2019s feature like intensity, duration and pitch were extracted. They could detect and classify circovirus type 2 (PVC2), porcine reproductive, respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus, and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (MH) diseases using sound\u2019s pitch-and-intensity analysis. Furthermore, cough duration was excluded because it couldn\u2019t find statistical difference between treatments (Gutierrez et al., 2010). Kasten et al. (2010) classified the bird species based on bird sound. Different feature functions of the signals were extracted to classify the bird sounds. They found that bird gender and species can be identified based on their sounds (Kasten et al., 2010). Lee et al. (2015) detected pig-wasting disease by using support vector machine (SVM) and acoustic features. In their research, 60 statistical parameters were extracted as signal indexes and the best features (RMS, Max Pitch, PSD, Peak frequency) were selected by using acoustic feature subset selection algorithm (AFSSA) method, which were used as inputs of the classifier (Lee et al., 2015). Since it is possible to detect sound signal features, different types of analyses can be performed. Analysis of chicken\u2019s vocalization is a powerful tool to study about animal behavior and welfare (Exadaktylos et al., 2014). Numerous factors such as diseases, weakness and species can change bird-generated sound signals. Sadeghi et al. (2015) designed an intelligent procedure for detecting chickens infected by Clostridium perfringens based on their vocalization. Chicken\u2019s vocalization was analyzed in time domain, and 25 statistical features were extracted from sound signals and the best features were selected using FDA method to be ANN\u2019s input data (Sadeghi et al., 2015).",

FFT is the most common method in frequency domain, which is defined as followings (Zhu et al., 2009):(1)x(f)=\u222b-\u221e+\u221ex(t)e-j\u03c9tdt,when\u03c9=2\u03c0fwhere \u201ct\u201d and \u201cf\u201d are time and frequency, respectively, and x(f) is the Fourier transform of the time-domain signal x(t). Frequency information of the signals can be identified by using FFT method. Discrete wavelet transform is a 2-dimensional signal analysis used for achieving simultaneous time and frequency transparencies. Wavelet transform does not treat all frequency components of a signal similarly. While, WT presents an accurate time-transparency for rapid variations, and an accurate frequency transparency for slowing variations (Banakar and Azeem, 2008, Misiti et al., 1996). An advantage of WT is denoising, therefor it is suitable for analyzing noisy signals (Marchant, 2003). DWT is defined as (2) (Khanam et al., 2014):(2)DWT\u03c8x(j,k)=\u03a8\u03c8x(j,k)=12j\u222b-\u221e+\u221ex(t)\u03c8t-2jk2j\n",

Although SVM was originally designed for binary (2-classes) classification (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995), it has been applied to solve multiclass problems.

One builds a multiclass SVM by combining several 2-class SVMs, including one-against-one (OAO) and one-against-all (OAA). The third method considers all classes at once, called all-together. A good review of SVM and its equations has been presented by (Widodo and Yang, 2007). In the present study, OAO multiclass method was used to make multiclass SVM. The performance of the classifier can be calculated by computing SVM\u2019s statistical parameter like Sensitivity, Specificity and the total classification accuracy, as followings (\u00dcbeyli, 2008):(a)\nSensitivity: The number of true positive decision/number of actually positive cases.(b)\nSpecificity: The number of true negative decision/number of actually negative cases.(c)\nTotal classification accuracy: The number of correct decisions/total number of cases.\n",

Maximum Sensitivity of the D-S evidence theory was obtained based on AI among other diseases and it can be inferred that detection of AI based on chicken\u2019s sound signals was much easier than ND and BV.

For this purpose, an electronic device was developed and ND, BV and AI were diagnosed with high accuracy. This is a nondestructive, fast and automatic instrument in diagnosis avian diseases. For further application of this method, other common diseases also should be evaluated and the method needs to be tested in farm condition which may have different noises. The results suggest that this intelligent technique performed successfully in diagnosing ND, BV and AI from the chicken\u2019s sound signals which could be as a fast technique in order to decline the number of disease spreading and mortality in chicken\u2019s farm. The results also offer the use of intelligent methods for diagnosing diseases in other species of poultry.",
