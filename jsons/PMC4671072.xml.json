As depicted in Fig. 4a, following designated duration of cell co-culture with infected neutrophils, influenza virus Nucleoprotein expression was detected with immunocytochemistry in FHC cells. The expression level of virul Nucleoprotein in the FHC cells at 4 h post infection was very low. With the increase of viral replication cycles, infected neutrophils gradually released more mature viral particles. The numbers of infected FHC cells were significantly increased at 8, 16 and 24 h post infection. The amounts of virus nucleoprotein positive signals were remarkably enhanced at 24 h (Fig. 4a). Compared with the control group (Fig. 4b), in which FHC cells were directly incubated with parent virus propagated in embryonated eggs, we found that the rate of infected FHC cells co-cultured with virus-infected neutrophils was much higher (Fig. 4c). At 24 h post infection, flow cytometry demonstrated that the control group (FHC cells directly incubated with parent virus) had an average positive signal expression rate of 12.4%, and the experimental group (FHC cells co-cultured with virus-infected neutrophils) had an average rate of 50.8% (Fig. 4d), represent an increase of reflecting an infection rate increase of over fourfold.",

We performed lectin staining with MAA and SNA on neutrophils and no detectible level of sialic acid, nor \u03b1-2,3-linked or \u03b1-2,6-linked was found, while positive controls ensured the reliability of our technical protocal. Two probabilities exist: Low level sialic acid residues might exist on neutrophil surface that might be below the detecting sensibility of lectin staining, or 2009 A (H1N1) virus strain can enter neutrophils without the classic salic acid receptors. As shown in Fig. S1, there was no difference in the percentage of infected cells between groups of neutrophils with and without NA pretreatment. This result indicates that even low level of sialic acid residues exist on neutrophil surface, sialic acid-dependent entry may not the main route for influenza virus to infect neutrophils. There is likely that other sialic acid receptors independent route(s) of entry might exit for influenza virus to infect neutrophils.",

Macropinocytosis is yet another pathway for viruses to enter neutrophils without binding to specific receptors23. Phagocytosis is a major strategy for neutrophils to defend against invading pathogens, and this is also a possible pathway for viruses to enter neutrophils24. Inconsistence between the distributions of classic avian influenza virus receptor and infected cells in H5N1 virus infected patients was also reported2526. The way and means of viral entry into neutrophils remain a subject of farther investigation.",

Phagocyte dysfunction induced by influenza virus is one likely contributor to the development of bacterial superinfection, in addition to damage to respiratory epithelium2829. Neutrophils and monocyte/macrophages infiltrate at the site of virus infection, and participate in the early inflammatory response. Both cell types exhibit depressed function in vivo during influenza virus infection30. Substantial evidences have been documented about the effect of influenza viruses on neutrophil function. Accelerated apoptosis5 and defects in chemotactic, oxidative and bacterial killing functions28 of neutrophils have been established in influenza virus infection. In addition, influenza virus itself can induce activation of neutrophils to generate a respiratory burst response31, but impair the ability of neutrophil respiratory burst respond to other stimuli32. In this study, we examined the conditions of neutrophils before and after infection by 2009 A (H1N1) strain virus. In accordance with other reports, 2009 A (H1N1) strain virus reduced cell viability, accelerated cell apoptosis, activated neutrophils itself and deactivated the ability of the cells to respond to FMLP (Fig. 5). Neutrophil dysfunction might be resulted from previous activation by influenza virus, inducing cell deactivation and viability reduction.",

The pathologic findings of these autopsies included hemophagocytic activities in the spleen, liver, lymph node, and bone marrow37383940, white pulp atrophy with depletion of lymphocytes in the spleen253839; apoptotic lymphocytes in the spleen and the intestine40; acute tubular necrosis2539; activated Kupffer cells, cholestasis, fatty liver253940, and edema of the brain2539. What\u2019s more, the H5N1 virus penetrated the placental barrier and infected the fetus25. Pandemic 2009 A (H1N1) virus was found to replicate in the intestine of the ferrets besides respiratory tract, a sign of multiple organ infection41. Previous reports demonstrated that infection by 2009 H1N1 virus was not confined to the upper respiratory tract but also involved the lungs and other organs, most importantly immune cells3642. Many fatal patients had lymphopenia and elevated creatinine kinase (CK)434445. Lymphocytic disruption caused an acute immunodeficiency that resulted in acute progressive respiratory syndrome including lower respiratory tract disease, respiratory failure, and ARDS with refractory hypoxaemia4344. Based on our current findings that neutrophils can be infected by 2009 A (H1N1) and permit active viral replication, we hypothesize that infected immune cells including neutrophils may act as vehicles, transporting the virus to other organs and causing extra-pulmonary dissemination and multiple organ infection. The extent of immune system infection may be a determinant factor for the disease.",
