Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), the most severe form of PID, is usually fatal within the first year of life unless corrected [1]. Other T cell and innate immune defects have excessive morbidity and mortality through childhood and early adulthood. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is curative for many patients with a 10-year survival of 84% in HLA-matched sibling HSCT for SCID 2, 3. Ten-year survival for non-SCID PID is 71% for HLA-matched sibling HSCT, with survival rates improving over time 2, 3.",

Advantages and disadvantages of CBT over bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are reviewed in detail elsewhere 4, 5. Advantages include (1) easy access to the cord blood unit and, therefore, earlier transplantation; (2) absence of risk to donor; (3) lower risk of latent viral transmission and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD); and (4) higher chance of matching rare HLA haplotypes. However, the stem cell dose is often low and unrelated donors are not available for boost HSCT. Cord blood units are virologically na\u00efve and often show slower engraftment due to a lower CD34+ dose compared to BMT and PBSCs. Both of these factors increase the risks from pre-existing infections in CBT for PID patients.",

A recent study demonstrated a lower rate of grades II to IV GvHD and improved survival in unrelated CBT when the authors compared their results with similar studies of BMT for PID and that mortality was associated with pre-existing infection, no conditioning, \u22652 HLA mismatch and underlying disease [10]. However, this study does not provide data on lymphocyte reconstitution or long-term graft function. Other studies with limited data on lymphocyte reconstitution show that absolute lymphocyte counts increase from 2 months with a proportional increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from 3 months post CBT and that age-related normal values for CD19+, CD3+, and CD4+ are reached by 24 months in all patients studied 7, 11. All surviving patients in 1 series were independent of intravenous immunoglobulin and responded to T cell stimulation, tetanus, and hepatitis B vaccination [7].",

Immune reconstitution is delayed by alemtuzumab in patients with malignant and nonmalignant hematological conditions 13, 16, 17 with some studies suggesting slower immune reconstitution with higher doses used 12, 18, 19. This slower immune reconstitution is, in turn, associated with an increased incidence of viral reactivation, notably cytomegalovirus 17, 20, 21, 22, adenovirus 14, 23, 24 and respiratory viruses [25]. This is particularly pertinent when considering CBT for PID because many patients have active or latent viral infections at the time of HSCT and CBT is considered to have slower immune reconstitution and be virologically na\u00efve 4, 5. The role of serotherapy in CBT for PID has not been explored to date.",

A retrospective study of these patients was performed, of which 14 have been previously reported [6]. There was a systematic change in serotherapy policy at the Children\u2019s BMT Unit in 2006 to 2007, when the alemtuzumab dose was reduced to determine if it had the same protective effects on GvHD without an increase in viral infection. Two patients were excluded from further analysis because they received alemtuzumab before conditioning at 3 and 4 weeks before CBT, and another was excluded because the patient received rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG) instead of alemtuzumb. Those who received no serotherapy (n = 11) were also excluded because 6 did not receive chemotherapeutic conditioning and others were selected to this group based on clinical presentation. The remaining patients were retrospectively nonrandomly assigned to high-dose (alemtuzumab \u2265 .9 mg/kg given in 5 divided doses before day -10 or between day -8 and day -4; n = 11) or low-dose (alemtuzumab .3 to .6 mg/kg given in 3 divided doses on consecutive days between day -11 and day -6; n = 9) serotherapy groups for the purpose of analysis. No alemtuzumab pharmacokinetic studies were performed. Underlying diagnoses by serotheraphy group are shown in Supplementary Table S1.",

In our study, lower dose serotherapy improved T lymphocyte reconstitution with better thymopoiesis at 4 months post transplant than high-dose serotherapy. This is particularly pertinent in the setting of CBT for PID. In our study, the majority of patients had SCID and, therefore, further delay in T cell reconstitution from excessive serotherapy might delay clearance of pre-existing viral infection. The delay in immune reconstitution between high- and low-dose serotherapy could be explained by the prolonged exposure of the graft to lympholytic antibodies when higher doses are given. Lympholytic concentrations of alemtuzumab have been shown to be present up to 56 days after HSCT when very high doses are given in vivo [31].",

Thymopoiesis was evident at 1 year after transplantation [32]. In contrast to this study by Chiesa et al., our study demonstrated a delayed restoration of median T cell counts until 4 months post CBT when low-dose serotherapy was given and a further delay in T lymphocyte reconstitution to 6 months post CBT when using high dose serotherapy. CD3+ reconstitution in our study improved at 4 months when low-dose serotherapy was given as compared with high-dose serotherapy, which is likely caused by corresponding improvements in CD4+ and CD4+ ETEE counts in the low-dose serotherapy group. The evidence of thymopoiesis in the low-dose serotherapy group at 4 months again contrasts with the study by Chiesa et al. The T cell reconstitution in the low-dose serotherapy group seen in our study at 4 months post transplantation is, therefore, likely to be explained by expansion in both a thymic dependant and independent manner.",

We found the protection afforded against GvHD by lower dose serotherapy to be similar to high-dose serotherapy. In the study by Chiesa et al., 63% of patients had viral infections and 2 patients died from viral infection [32]. In our study, 35% of patients had pre-existing viral infection, and 35% developed new viral infection after CBT, with no difference between high- and low-dose serotherapy groups. This is important in the PID setting where many patients present with pre-existing viral illness. However, our definition of viral clearance and the small numbers of patients with viral infection at time of transplantation make it difficult to determine the effects of serotherapy dose on clearance of pre-existing viral infections. The influence of giving serotherapy on viral clearance in the context of PID and CBT needs further work with larger studies.",

Overall other studies demonstrated higher rates of GvHD grades II to IV than our study 7, 8, 9, 10. However, these rates of GvHD are more likely to be caused by the greater number of CBT with 2 or more mismatched HLA loci, as compared with our study than the difference in serotherapy used.
