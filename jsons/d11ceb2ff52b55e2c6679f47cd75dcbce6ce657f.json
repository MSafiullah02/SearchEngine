CT is shown to be more sensitive in the early diagnosis of COIVD-19 infection compared to Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests [7] . Wang et al. trained a deep learning model on 325 COVID-19 CT images and 740 typical pneumonia images. Their model identified 46 COVID-19 cases that were previously missed by the RT-PCR test. Further, quantitative information from CT images, such as lung burden, percentage of high opacity and lung severity score, can be used to monitor disease progression and help us understand the course of COVID-19 [8] , [9] .",

            "text": "U-Net ( [19] , [39] ) has been proposed for 5 years, and many variants have been proposed to improve it. However, recent study [40] demonstrates that a basic U-Net is still difficult to surpass if the corresponding pipeline is designed adequately. 4 http://medicaldecathlon.com/files/MSD-Ranking-scheme.pdf In particular, nnU-Net (no-new-U-Net) [40] was proposed to automatically adapt preprocessing strategies and network architectures (i.e., the number of pooling, convolutional kernel size, and stride size) to a given 3D medical dataset. Without manual tuning, nnU-Net achieved better performance than most specialised deep learning pipelines in 19 public international segmentation competitions and set a new state-of-theart in the majority of 49 tasks. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet. U-Net is often used as a baseline model in existing COVID-19 CT segmentation studies. However, reported results vary a lot even in the same dataset, which make it hard to compare different studies. To standardize the U-Net performance, we build our baselines on nnU-Net, which is the most powerful U-Net implementation to the best of our knowledge. To make it comparable between different tasks, we manually adjust the patch size and network architectures in task 2 and task 3 to be the same as task 1. Figure 2 shows details of the U-Net architecture.",

It demonstrates that reporting 5-fold cross validation results is necessary to obtain an object evaluation because 1-fold results may be biased. \u2022 promising results for left and right lung segmentation in COVID-19 CT scans can be achieved with as few as four training cases. Models trained for segmenting lung obtained significantly better results compared with those trained for segmenting lung and infection simultaneously. \u2022 There is still large room for improving infection segmentation with limited annotations. Statistical tests are needed to justify whether there is an improvement from training the model for segmenting lung and infection at the same time.",

In other words, the trained models are expected to generalize to the unseen domain (COVID-19 CT). Table V shows left lung and right lung segmentation results in terms of average and standard deviation values of DSC and NSD. It can be found that \u2022 3D U-Net achieves excellent performance in terms of DSC on the validation set that is from the same source domain. Average NSD values are lower than DSC values, implying that most of the errors come from the boundary. \u2022 the performance on the testing set drops significantly on both subtasks. The performance of the model trained on NSCLC Lung dataset is worse than the model trained on StuctSeg lung. We suppose it is because the difference in the distribution lung appearance is smaller between StructSeg and COVID-19-CT. \u2022 on the validation set, the performance of lesion segmentation is not as good as the performance of lung segmentation (Table V) , which means that tumor segmentation remains a challenging problem. This observation is in line with recent results in MICCAI tumor segmentation challenge, i.e. liver tumor segmentation [41] and kidney tumor segmentation [42] . \u2022 The models almost fail to predict COVID-19 infections on testing set, which highlights that the lesion appearances differ significantly among lung cancer, pleural effusion, and COVID-19 infections in CT scans.",

On one hand, we focus on how to learn from a few training cases(task 1) and how to efficiently use existing annotations. Thus, the number of training cases is acceptable for our benchmark tasks. On the other hand, we have 16 or 20 testing cases in each task. The number of testing cases is comparable with the setting of recent MICCAI 2020 segmentation challenges. For example, MyoPS 2020 (Myocardial pathology segmentation combining multi-sequence CMR) has 15 testing cases [43] . StructSeg (Automatic Structure Segmentation for Radiotherapy Planning Challenge 2020) has 10 testing cases [44] and ASOCA (Automated Segmentation Of Coronary Arteries) has 20 testing cases [45] . Another possible limitation is that only quantitative results of 3D U-Net are reported. We will also provide 2D U-Net baselines for all tasks in the near future.",
