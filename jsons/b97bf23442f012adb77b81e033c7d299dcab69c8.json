As of May 7, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recorded 547 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the oPt; 527 in the West Bank and 20 in the Gaza Stripwith 4 fatalities. (1) The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) has been unable to support Palestinians' COVID-19 response needs at their full capacity at the consequence of funding cut and legal restrictions that were in place prior to the pandemic.(2) Multiple COVID-19 testing sites serving Palestinians in East Jerusalem have been closed by the Israeli authorities. ( 3) The West Bank is particularly vulnerable due to checkpoint closures, halt of the transportation of patients to hospitals, and redistribution of clinical supplies. The Gaza Strip is one of the most densely populated places on earth with 2 million inhabitants, mostly refugees, live in 365 sq. km 2 , allowing for an accelerated spread of disease should a COVID-19 outbreak manifest. (4) Other LMICs in the Middle East and Africa have also reported scarcity of personal protective equipment (PPE) for front line healthcare workers (HCWs).(5, 6) We hypothesize that (HCWs) in the oPt are largely underprepared to address COVID-19 related needs of the Palestinian population in both the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Shortages of PPE pose a serious threat to COVID-19 containment in the oPt. It is also expected that HCWs in the oPt have likely received insufficient training on how to address spread and containment of COVID-19; institutions themselves may not have yet been equipped to draw up or implement preventative or management protocols. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies evaluating the preparedness of the HCWs to face COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we aim to evaluate the availability of PPE and the level of preparedness among the HCWs in the oPt.",

(8) Our modified questionnaire consisted of 22 questions divided into 3 different sections (respondent and healthcare facility characteristics, availability of PPE and HCWs preparedness). Availability of PPE and HCWs preparedness were assessed on a 5-point Likert scale. The questionnaire was distributed to HCWs in the oPt through convenient sampling between March 30, 2020 and April 12, 2020. E-mail lists for participants in an educational link (OxPal) and social media (Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn) groups of HCWs in oPt were used to disseminate the questionnaire. Participants were required to sign in to limit the number of responses to one per respondent.",

Univariate analysis (chi-squared and Fisher's Exact tests) was also used to compare participants' profession, geographical location, and responses to questions related to the availability of PPE and HCWs preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic. Likert scale variables were converted from 5-point to binary variables for univariate analysis. For example, often available, sometimes available, rarely availably and never available were grouped together as 'not always available'. Strongly agree and moderately agree were grouped into 'agree' variable compared to 'neutral' and 'disagree' categories.

Alcohol-based hand sanitizers, gloves, face masks, eye protection, isolation gowns, N95 respirators and face shields were reported to be inconsistently available, despite being internationally recommended as critical equipment needed for protecting health care workers from infection.(9) Governmental hospitals, as opposed to non-governmental settings, appear to be particularly lacking in equipment. Lessons from prior outbreaks have underlined the importance of PPE in infection control. (10) Recommendations from the WHO suggest the inadequate supply of infection prevention and control measures is vital to address immediately, with assistance from international partners if necessary.(11) The WHO specifically mentioned supplies needed to implement recommended protocols, such as PPE, being a key resource to all national authorities currently not producing sufficient volumes themselves. Suggestions for other methods of procurement, conservation and management of PPE have been extensively covered in the literature during the pandemic. (12) Many of these suggestions may not be viable in the geopolitical and economic context in which oPt operates. However, methods such as governmental coordination of all PPE supply, extending or creating new supply through 3D printing all provide viable means of blunting the dearth of PPE in oPt currently. (13, 14) Our study showed that most HCWs surveyed did not receive adequate training on local protocol or measures to address COVID-19 spread from an institutional perspective. Comparing the preparedness of HCWs in oPt to those around the world, will be a vital element of the debrief from this pandemic and important in developing strategies to ensure the oPt have protocols in place for future public health crises.

To our knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to assess the availability of PPE in oPt and the preparedness of HCWs to face the COVID-19 pandemic. We provided a comprehensive evaluation of most PPE described in the literature and used clinically. Participants were well-represented across gender, geographic region, department/specialty, level of training, profession and type of health care facility.",

Another weakness of our study was the failure to elicit whether the lack of appropriate PPE was one of the driving factors in reducing HCW confidence in their preparedness. This would then imply attempts to target increasing PPE provision could both protect HCW and improve clinical confidence in managing COVID-19 patients. Potential selection bias arises due to sampling method. Most study participants were recruited from social media posts and emails to the networks of the researchers involved, which may limit some of the study's generalizability. However, other studies have demonstrated the viability of social media recruitment and snowball sampling to access difficult to reach populations.(16) Additionally, participants were asked to report on their individual experiences and thus may or may not be wholly representative of the institutions in which they are employed. The cross-sectional nature of this study is also by definition unable to take into account any changes in equipment or training preparedness over time and is only representative of the point-in-time data were collected. These limitations were acknowledged by the authors during study enrolment due to the need to publish findings within the international community in a time-sensitive manner and address the gap in literature regarding COVID-19's unique impact on the population in the oPt.",
