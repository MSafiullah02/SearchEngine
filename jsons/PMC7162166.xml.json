            "text": "The West Nile virus (WNV) is an arthropod\u2010borne virus in the Flaviridae family, which induces febrile syndrome, meningitis, encephalitis, hepatitis, flaccid paralysis, and even death (Sampson et al., 2000). It harbours single\u2010stranded RNA, which encodes for the capsid, envelope, premembrane proteins and seven non\u2010structural proteins that have been implicated in viral replication (Chambers et al., 1990). WNV is known to induce Bax\u2010dependent or Bax\u2010independent apoptotic cell death in several cancer and brain cell lines, and in mouse brain and skeletal muscles (Parquet et al., 2001; Yang et al., 2002; Chu and Ng, 2003; Ramanathan et al., 2006). A few factors expressed by the WNV genome, including NS2B\u2013NS3 and WNV capsid (WNVCp), have been shown to participate in WNV\u2010mediated apoptosis (Oh et al., 2006a; Ramanathan et al., 2006). However, the mechanisms involved directly in these processes have yet to be characterized fully.",

            "text": "As Bax is a transcriptional target of p53, it appears likely that WNV infection may involve a p53\u2010associated mechanism (Miyashita and Reed, 1995). As a tumour suppressor which functions as a transcription factor, p53 is activated in response to oncogenic or DNA\u2010damaging stresses, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Harris and Levine, 2005; Vousden and Prives, 2005). When these surveillance functions of p53 against tumour\u2010inducing factors are lost, cells become predisposed to tumourogenecity (Donehower et al., 1992; Christophorou et al., 2006). Under normal conditions, p53 accumulation is constantly prevented by HDM2\u2010mediated ubiquitination, followed by 26S proteasome\u2010dependent degradation (Haupt et al., 1997; Kubbutat et al., 1997). HDM2 is also a transcriptional target of p53, which participates in the negative feedback loop of p53 to inhibit abnormal p53 accumulation under normal conditions (Haupt et al., 1997). A variety of oncogenic stresses are also known to induce the post\u2010translational modification of p53, resulting in its acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation or sumoylation (Harris and Levine, 2005). These processes appear to prevent direct interactions between p53 and HDM2. Also, the interactions between HDM2 and p53 can be blocked via the inhibitory effects of the ARF tumour suppressor protein (p14ARF and p19ARF for human and mouse respectively) (Kamijo et al., 1998; Sherr and Weber, 2000). ARF, which is activated by oncoproteins, including E2F\u20101, Ras or Myc, as well as oncogenic stresses, is located within the nucleolus, and induces the sequestration of HDM2 into the nucleolus via direct interaction (Tao and Levine, 1999; Sherr and Weber, 2000). Thus, stressed conditions prevent HDM2\u2010mediated p53 degradation and result in p53 activation, inducing apoptosis or cell cycle arrest. Mice lacking only ARF evidenced spontaneous tumour development with an interruption of the p53\u2010dependent signal transduction pathway, indicating the upstream role of ARF in the process of p53\u2010mediated stress responses (Kamijo et al., 1997). Similarly to ARF, ribosomal proteins L11 and L23 also bind to HDM2 and induce its localization into the nucleolus, resulting in the activation of p53 (Lohrum et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2003; Jin et al., 2004). In addition, PML also sequesters HDM2 into the nucleolus under stressed conditions and increases the stability of p53 (Bernardi et al., 2004). Thus, it appears that the nucleolar sequestration of HDM2 is one of the essential strategies utilized for the augmentation of the transcriptional activities of p53.",

            "text": "In previous studies, it was suggested that WNVCp induced apoptosis in cancer cells via caspase\u20109 activation and mitochondrial dysfunction (Yang et al., 2002). As the suggested apoptotic mechanism is closely associated with the Bax\u2010dependent pathway, we attempted to determine whether WNVCp could affect the levels of Bax and its transcriptional activator, p53 (Miyashita and Reed, 1995). The results of this study indicated that ectopic WNVCp expression was capable of inducing the accumulation of p53 and its target proteins, Bax and Hdm2, in U2OS human osteoblastoma cells harbouring normal p53 (Fig. 1A). In SK\u2010N\u2010SH cells, WNVCp also induced p53 overexpression and the cleavage of PARP, an apoptotic marker (Fig. S1A). WNVCp also induced caspase\u20109 and \u20103 activation in the same cell lines, as was previously reported (data not shown, and Fig. S1B) (Yang et al., 2002). Consistently, WNVCp\u2010mediated caspase\u20109 and caspase\u20103 were also activated in AGS cells, which harbour functional p53, but this was not observed in 293T cells, as its p53 was suppressed by the large T antigen (data not shown). p53 accumulation was determined not to be the result of activated transcription, as the mRNA levels of p53 detected via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) were unchanged (data not shown). Although these results show that the WNVCp may post\u2010translationally stabilize p53, this was not found to be the result of any direct interaction occurring between WNVCp and p53, as the proteins did not interact with each other in our system, as was shown by the results of immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). Interestingly, the ectopic expression of WNVCp was capable of reducing the HDM2\u2010mediated ubiquitination of p53 (Fig. 1C, lanes 4 and 5). These results prompted us to attempt to determine whether WNVCp could regulate the E3 ligase activities of HDM2 via direct interaction. Immunoprecipitation and GST\u2010pulldown assays indicated that WNVCp and HDM2 could bind directly (Fig. 1D and F, lane 5). Mdm2, which is a mouse Hdm2, was also capable of interacting with WNVCp (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, exogenous HDM2 was stabilized by WNVCp in the H1299 cell line, which lacks HDM2's transcriptional activator, p53 (Fig. 2A). The reduction of HDM2 self\u2010ubiquitination in the presence of WNVCp shows that WNVCp could inhibit E3 ligase activities via direct interaction (Fig. 2B, lane 4).",

HDM2 overexpressed alone in the cells effected a reduction in p53 levels, whereas the addition of WNVCp prevented the HDM2\u2010mediated depletion of p53 (Fig. 2C, lane 3). Using immunoprecipitation assays, WNVCp was determined to interfere with the physical interaction between HDM2 and p53 (Fig. 2D, lanes 3\u20135). Taken together, our results indicated that WNVCp was capable of inhibiting and stabilizing HDM2 via direct interaction with it.

The localization of WNVCp into the nucleolus was verified by observing that WNVCp colocalized with a nucleolar protein, nucleolin, in U2OS (Fig. 3A, panels 1\u20134). WNVCp was also capable of localizing to the nucleoli in SK\u2010N\u2010SH, H1299, 293T and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) (data not shown). However, HDM2 expressed alone remained in the nucleoplasm, as has been reported in previous studies (Fig. 3A, panels 5 and 6) (Tao and Levine, 1999). Upon the coexpression of HDM2 and WNVCp, both proteins were localized in the nucleoli in U2OS, as well as the other cancer cell lines mentioned above (Fig. 3B, panels 1\u201312, and data not shown). Similarly, the nucleolar colocalization of exogenous WNVCp and endogenous HDM2 was observed in U2OS (Fig. 3B, panels 13\u201316). Interestingly, when WNVCp was exogenously expressed, approximately 50% of the cells evidence a localization of WNVCp in both the nucleolus and the cytoplasm, thereby indicating that WNVCp is not entirely restricted to the nucleolus as the result of artificial overexpression (Fig. 3B, panels 5\u20138). Overall, WNVCp was capable of sequestering HDM2 into the nucleolus, which would prevent the formation of a complex between HDM2 and p53.",

            "text": "If WNVCp proved able to mediate p53\u2010dependent apoptosis via the inhibition of HDM2, WNVCp should be defective in displaying apoptotic effects in the absence of p53. In order to determine this, WNVCp was transfected into the wild\u2010type or p53\u2010null MEF, then evaluated with regard to its apoptotic influences. The results indicated that WNVCp was capable of inducing p53 and its target protein, Bax, in wild\u2010type MEF but not in p53\u2010null cells. Furthermore, caspase\u20109 and caspase\u20103 were activated only in wild\u2010type MEF. The cleaved PARP, the target of caspase\u20103, was also observed only in the wild\u2010type (Fig. 6A, lane 2). Caspase\u20109 and caspase\u20103 activation were confirmed further by monitoring the cleavage of its colorimetric substrate of caspase\u20109 and \u20103 (data not shown). Finally, we conducted FITC\u2010Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) double staining in order to detect apoptotic cell death via FACS analysis. The data indicated that the transfection of WNVCp induced Annexin V staining in 40% of the wild\u2010type MEF, whereas it exerted no effects on p53\u2010null MEF. When Bax was overexpressed as a control in both cell lines, it induced apoptosis with or without p53, as had been expected (Fig. 6B). This indicates that apoptosis via WNVCp occurred only in the wild\u2010type MEF. As neural cells are quite susceptible to the pathogenic effects of WNV, we next attempted to determine whether WNVCp was capable of inducing the p53\u2010dependent apoptotic pathway in human neuroblastoma SH\u2010SY5Y cells (SY\u2010control) or SH\u2010SY5Y cells stably transfected with a plasmid that expressed p53 siRNA (SY\u2010p53\u2010siRNA). SY\u2010p53\u2010siRNA cells evidenced reduced levels of p53 (Fig. 6C). When these cells were transfected with EGFP\u2010WNVCp, the SY\u2010control evidenced increased caspase\u20109 and \u20103 activities after 24 and 48 h, whereas the SY\u2010p53\u2010siRNA cells were not affected by it (data not shown). The SY\u2010control and SY\u2010p53\u2010siRNA cells were tested further for cell death in the presence or absence of EGFP\u2010WNVCp via measurements of the mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) or the PI uptake in live cells. Both cells were transfected with plasmids expressing either EGFP\u2010WNVCp or EGFP, and the cells expressing EGFP were gated. The shift in MMP was observed only in the SY\u2010control expressing EGFP\u2010WNVCp (Fig. 6D, upper panel, dotted line). A total of 60% of the SY\u2010control cells expressing EFGP\u2010WNVCp consistently evidenced increased PI staining at 48 h, whereas this was only observed in 13% of the SH\u2010SY5Y\u2010p53\u2010siRNA, thereby indicating that the presence of p53 is a prerequisite for WNVCp\u2010mediated cell death (Fig. 6E). When the same experiments were conducted on cell lines containing either functional or non\u2010functional p53, we observed that only the cell lines harbouring functional p53 were stained with PI (data not shown). Collectively, these observations suggested that WNVCp could induce the apoptotic process in a p53\u2010dependent manner.",

            "text": "The data presented above define the possible functional roles of WNVCp under overexpressed conditions. However, the functional relevancy of WNVCp in vivo needs to be addressed in order to understand the role of WNVCp under physiological conditions. In order to ascertain whether WNVCp still carries out the function described above under infectious conditions, we infected mammalian cells with WNV. First, we conducted immunoprecipitation analyses of WNVCp and endogenous Hdm2 using 293T cells infected with WNV. The data indicate that the WNVCp expressed from infected WNV was able to interact with endogenous Hdm2, suggesting a possible in vivo regulatory role of WNVCp with regard to the function of Hdm2 (Fig. 7A). We then attempted to determine whether WNVCp was capable of inducing the nucleolar localization of endogenous Mdm2 as suggested by in vitro analysis using wild\u2010type MEF (Fig. 3B). The results of immunofluorescent analysis indicated that the endogenous Mdm2 alone was localized within the nucleoplasm (Fig. 7B, panels 1 and 2). WNVCp expressed from the WNV infection was principally localized in the cytoplasm and nucleoli as it colocalized with the nucleolus marker, nucleophosmin (Fig. 7B, panels 3\u20136). When wild\u2010type MEF cells were infected by WNV, we observed that WNVCp and endogenous Mdm2 were colocalized in the nucleolus. These results indicate that WNVCp and endogenous Mdm2 are able to interact in vivo, which might facilitate the induction of p53 due to the inhibition of endogenous Mdm2. To further test this, wild\u2010type or p53\u2010null MEF cells were infected using WNV, and its effects on both cell lines were monitored. The infection of WNV on the wild\u2010type MEF led to the induction of p53 and its target proteins, Bax and p21, but exerted no effects on p53\u2010null cells (Fig. 7C). Consistently, the propagation of WNV in p53\u2010null cells was significantly less efficient than was observed in the wild\u2010type, as shown by the lower amount of WNVCp detected, as is shown in Fig. 7C. The importance of p53 in the induction of cell death via WNV infection was obvious when the cell cycle of each cell line infected with WNV was characterized using FACS analysis (Fig. 7D). While the infection of cells using low doses of WNV exerted no apparent effects on p53\u2010null cells, it induced the cell cycle arrest of wild\u2010type MEF cells at the G1 phase. When high doses of WNV were applied to each of the cell lines, cell death was observed principally in the wild\u2010type MEF, whereas the p53\u2010null cells were arrested principally at the G1 phase. These data are consistent with the induction of p53 and its targets, p21 and Bax, under WNV infection conditions. Overall, the above\u2010described in vivo observations suggested that biologically relevant WNVCp could indeed interact with endogenous Mdm2, and that this interaction might result in the induction of p53, which resulted in cell cycle arrest or death.",

The infectious dose of WNV to cells has been shown to be responsible for the characterization of cellular necrotic or apoptotic processes (Chu and Ng, 2003). While a high level of viraemia in WNV infection might induce necrosis, treatments at low doses induced apoptosis via the annihilation of mitochondrial function, subsequent cytochrome c release and caspase\u20109 activation. Furthermore, it was suggested that WNV infection of cells might result in an upregulation of the levels of Bax, which is a target of the transcriptional factor, p53 (Parquet et al., 2001). Several WNV proteins have been implicated in the apoptotic processes induced upon infection. For example, members of the WNV's non\u2010structural proteins, the NS2B\u2013NS3 complex, were shown to induce the activation of caspase\u20108 in host cells, which results in their apoptosis. NS3 protease, and its cofactor NS2B, which are expressed in all of the Flaviviruses, including the Dengue and Langat viruses, evidence functional homology across species (Ramanathan et al., 2006). The capsid protein of WNV is another factor that has been shown to induce apoptosis via the activation of caspase\u20109 and caspase\u20103 and the disruption of mitochondrial function (Yang et al., 2002; Oh et al., 2006a). Thus, it has been established that WNV can induce the extrinsic or intrinsic apoptotic pathways mediated by the activation of caspase\u20108 or caspase\u20109 respectively.",

            "text": "p53 is a potent tumour suppressor transcription factor which mediates cell cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis (Harris and Levine, 2005). The participation of p53 with viral proteins has been identified as important factors in viral propagation. For example, the E6 ligase of the papilloma virus induces the degradation of p53, which results in cervical cancer in the long term (Werness et al., 1990). The regulatory mechanism of p53 by the hepatitis C virus NS5A and core proteins appear to play a critical role in finally inducing hepatoma in humans (Otsuka et al., 2000; Majumder et al., 2001). The simian virus 40 large tumour antigen, which binds to p53, is crucial for the transformation and induction of tumours in animals (Tiemann et al., 1995). All of these observations show that the virus was capable of negatively regulating the function of p53 to properly improve viral propagation in animal cells. Thus, it appears that a variety of viruses commonly employ the p53 regulator system for effective survival in nature. The results in this report indicate that WNVCp could also modulate the function of p53 by interaction with and the sequestration of HDM2 into the nucleolus. Under normal conditions, p53 is degraded constantly by the presence of its target E3 ligase, Hdm2 (Fig. 8, ). Upon WNV infection, expressed WNVCp will bind to Hdm2 and chaperone it to the nucleolus (Fig. 8, , ). This prevents the binding of Hdm2 to p53, which results in the stabilization of p53, Bax activation, and subsequent apoptosis (Fig. 8, , , ).",

As WNVCp is shown to induce the nucleolar localization of HDM2 in ARF\u2010null MEF, it appears that WNVCp does not require the presence of ARF in order to negatively regulate HDM2 (Fig. 4). We determined that all of these functional characteristics of WNVCp were quite similar to those of ARF.

When p53 was not present, WNV was incapable of inducing efficient cell death or cell cycle arrest, both of which are important for viral propagation. These observations indicate that WNV requires a pathway that will somehow affect the induction of p53. We suggest here that one of the pathways that WNV exploits for the induction of p53 is the arrest of Hdm2 in the nucleolus by WNVCp. Thus, p53 is no longer inhibited by Hdm2 and becomes able to induce cell cycle arrest or death via the induction of its target genes (Fig. 8).",

            "text": "It has also been previously determined that viral proteins are localized to the nucleolus for the purpose of viral propagation. For example, the coronavirus or human hepatitis B virus harbour the N protein or Capsid protein respectively. These proteins are located within the nucleolus, which eventually can disrupt cytokinesis of host cells and facilitate the propagation of viral progeny (Hiscox et al., 2001; Ning and Shih, 2004). Thus, it seems likely that WNV might employ a strategy similar to the one described above via the localization of its capsid protein into the nucleolus, and may also control the cytokinesis of host cells. Still, our findings indicate an intriguing pathway by which viral proteins could evolutionally mimic and adapt to the biochemical processes of host cells, in order to regulate their cellular fate.",
