To reduce the risk of viral spread, all 14 patients in our study received epidural anesthesia. Moriguchi et al. 3 verified our concern when they reported a case of viral encephalitis caused by SARS-CoV-2 and confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the CSF using genome sequencing.",

Recently, Bhatraju et al. 4 reported a large proportion of critically ill COVID-19 patients presenting with shock that required vasopressor support and was directly related to COVID-19. One reason might be that SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme-II (ACE2) receptor. The ACE2 receptor is a cardio-cerebrovascular protective factor, which plays an important role in regulating blood pressure, in addition to have an anti-atherosclerosis mechanism. 5 Because the duration of perioperative hypotension we reported was short (and not more than a 30% reduction from baseline), there was no apparent increase in end-organ damage. Perioperative hypotension was effectively treated using a combination of left lateral lying position, intravenous fluids, and vasopressor support (phenylephrine).",

As outlined by Benhamou et al., 1 there was insufficient time for the anesthesiologist to inject an additional dose into the epidural catheter previously placed for labour analgesia early enough to obtain adequate surgical anesthesia. A multidisciplinary diagnosis and treatment model is the key for the anesthesiologist to don personal protective equipment and to prepare the needed equipment and medications before the patient entered the operating room, so that once the obstetrician completes the evaluation of the patient and communicates with the anesthesiologist, pediatrician and nurse, a rapid Cesarean delivery can be undertaken.",
