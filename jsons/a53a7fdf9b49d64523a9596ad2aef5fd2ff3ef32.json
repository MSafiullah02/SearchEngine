The Toronto lung transplant program reported utilization of DCD lungs to increase from 0% in 2006 to 27% in 2008 [4] . Around the same time, 36 DCD lungs were transplanted in the United States between 1987 and 2007 [5] . These as well as more recent data published by the International Society of heart and lung transplantation, showed reasonable recipient 5-year survival which was comparable to survival after transplantation with lungs from brain dead donors (DBD) [6] . Despite these findings and the continued discrepancy between number of available organs and listed patients, there continues to be a surprising amount of apprehension surrounding the use of DCD lungs by transplant programs as well as by the organ procurement organizations (OPO).",

For example the higher uncertainty of dry run, inability to thoroughly assess organs intraoperatively before procurement, inability to recruit and monitor gas exchange in real-time along with time constraints imposed by DCD donation decrease the appeal of DCD donation/procurement. Identifying additional pre-procurement factors that may predispose a donor to either not be approached or allocated is important in modifying practice to help increase donor utilization.",

Over a 15 -year time period, 15,458 DCD donors (30,916 lungs) were evaluated and only 3.7% were utilized for clinical transplantation. This is in stark contrast to 22.4% of lungs from brain-dead donors being utilized over the same time period. The vast proportion of organs in each group were just not recovered (DCD-73%, DBD 63%). Donor factors associated with nonutilization of DCD lungs included low P/F ratio, history of smoking and older age.",

It is very interesting to note however that a consent was not requested for 8.4% of DCD donors as opposed to only 2.2% DBD donors, highlighting differences in OPO practices and perhaps perceptions. On a similar note regional differences in DCD donation were also noted. Among these findings the practice of not approaching donor families to consent appears to be the most readily modifiable factor. This missed opportunity could potentially have added close to 100 (at 3.7% transplantation rate) lungs to the DCD donor lung pool during this time period. This is a remarkable finding that opens up avenues for improving education and changing perception at the OPO level. It is important to note that a significant share of this responsibility lies upon the local transplant centers.",

However, at the same time, newer allocation policies such as replacement of Donation Service Area (DSA) with a 250 nautical mile radius are expected to decrease traditional \"local\" donation, increase travel distance and cost and potentially decrease the appeal for programs to evaluate donors with uncertain outcomes such as DCD. Fortunately the 2 year outcomes show increase in total number of DCD in the post policy change era with regional variability [8] . Remarkably regions 7,9 and To add insult to injury, US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has proposed new standards that will require OPOs to stay close to or above the 75 th percentile (among OPOS) in both organ donation and organ transplantation rates [10]. This may force OPOs to prefer donors and organs with higher chance of acceptance for transplantation and may pose additional challenges to DCD lung donation and utilization.",

The long term effects may be different if financial constraints become more prominent.As I write this commentary, the world is struggling with the ravages of COVID-19 viral pandemic. All transplant activity has significantly slowed down if not come to a screeching halt in disease epicenters. In order to help sustain essential transplant activity, all major transplant organizations have recommended local procurement in order to decrease long distance travel to donor hospitals, especially across state borders. In this situation, acceptance of DCD donors could very well decrease ever more given the addition of an extra layer of uncertainty and/or lack of a suitable local procurement team.",
