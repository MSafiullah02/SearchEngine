Between May 1, 2015, and April 28, 2018, we found that the incidence of mortality in infants born at < 30 weeks\u2019 gestation at 25 hospitals in China was 25%, and the incidence of NEC was 6.2% [Siyuan Jiang, MD, written communication, October 2018]. Elsewhere, the overall mortality from NEC was reported to range from 15 to 30%, with more severe cases of NEC resulting in a higher mortality rate. For infants who survive, a significant risk exists for long-term complications and morbidity, including impaired neurodevelopment [1, 2].",

Human milk contains both nutritional components (e.g., proteins, amino acids, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals) and bioactive components (e.g., live immune cells, cytokines, hormones, and growth factors) that have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties [6, 7]. More recently, Hassiotou (now Kakulas) et al. [8] showed that human milk is a rich source of pluripotent stem cells that, when ingested by the infant, enter the blood stream and are incorporated into the major organ systems of the infant. Although their exact function still remains unknown, breast milk stem cells possibly benefit the infant through actively participating in growth and/or regeneration. The current evidence strongly suggests that fresh human milk may have a significant protective effect against both infection and NEC [9].",

The use of formula in low birth weight or very preterm infants was reported to increase the risk of developing NEC when compared with donor human milk [10]. Although human milk, either mother\u2019s own or donor milk, appears to be the best feeding source for the nutrition, immunoprotection, and development of the preterm infant, current practices related to the handling and use of human milk in the NICU raise questions about whether we are deriving the maximum benefit from its use. Currently, in many NICUs worldwide, milk expressed by mothers of preterm infants is frozen and stored prior to use. When the infant requires oral feeds, frozen milk is defrosted and warmed, fortifier is added as needed, and the milk is then fed to the infant. Freezing human milk at either \u2212 20 \u00b0C or \u2212 80 \u00b0C and for longer times decreases the energy content and amount and bioactivity of several important components of human milk [11, 12], including the fat, carbohydrates, secretory immunoglobulin A, lactoperoxidase, lysozyme, antibacterial factors, and antioxidants [11\u201318]. In addition, defrosted human milk does not contain any live stem cells because they have a half-life of approximately 4 h and die when human milk is frozen and/or heated [8].",

However, the issue is controversial, and guidelines vary [49]. Some guidelines recommend that preterm infants are fed pasteurized mother\u2019s own milk because of the potential risk of contamination by CMV. However, this may be unnecessary considering that if a mother is CMV positive, the infant already will have been exposed to CMV in utero. We will address this concern in our study by requiring every neonate admitted to the NICU to be tested for CMV and pasteurizing infected milk before use.",

Very preterm infants have diminished antioxidant capacity and are frequently exposed to oxidative stress from multiple sources such as infection, oxygen therapy, and mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, excess oxygen can secondarily lead to retinopathy of prematurity or chronic lung disease in preterm infants [\ufeff45\ufeff]. NEC, intraventricular/periventricular hemorrhage, and retinopathy of prematurity are all thought to be consequences of the imbalance between antioxidant capacity and oxidative stress [50]. Previous studies reported that human milk has important and essential antioxidant components, which may prevent and protect against diseases in infancy [45]. Human milk feeding remains an essential tool to help in the protection against free radicals, oxygen reactive species and oxidative stress, with fresh human milk having been reported to have the highest antioxidant activity [\ufeff45].",

If applicable, we will also conduct regression adjusted for propensity score estimated based on the infant and NICU characteristics available.
