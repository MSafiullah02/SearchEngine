Anthranilic acid (0.02 mol) was dissolved in 30 mL of anhydrous pyridine by stirring slowly at room temperature. The solution was cooled to 0 \u00b0C and a solution of benzoyl chloride (0.02 mol) in anhydrous pyridine 30 mL was added to this solution slowly with constant stirring. When the addition was complete the reaction mixture was stirred for half an hour mechanically at room temperature and set aside for 1 h. The pasty mass obtained was diluted with water and treated with aqueous sodium bicarbonate to remove the unreacted acid. When effervescence ceased, the solid material was filtered off and washed with water to remove the inorganic materials and the adhered pyridine. The crude benzoxazine thus obtained was dried and re-crystallized from diluted ethanol.",
