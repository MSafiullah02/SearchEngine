Patients with natural colds had been instructed to report for enrollment for treatment at the recognition of the first symptoms that they believed might represent the onset of a cold. Data from the 2 groups were compared for mean total and individual symptom severity by day. Time is reported as hours after virus inoculation for subjects with experimental colds and as the day of illness on the basis of the history given by patients with natural colds. Data from these studies were then used to construct histograms comparing the range of severity by day of the individual total symptom scores for each subject and to perform an analysis of the time to the development of maximum total symptom score.",

The model parameters for the marginal fixed effects were estimated by maximum likelihood in a generalized linear model with a negative binomial link function [13]. The variance-covariance parameters were estimated with an unstructured variance-covariance matrix form with use of the Huber and White estimator [14]. The independent variables included an index to distinguish between patients whose data were derived from the natural cold study (105 patients) and those whose data were derived from 1 of the 2 experimental challenge studies (141 patients). Indices were also included to distinguish between the 4 points in time when the symptoms were evaluated during the experimental and natural cold studies (for experimental studies, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h after virus inoculation; for natural colds, days 1, 2, 3, and 4 of illness, as determined by patient history). As the final components of the model, indices were included to estimate study group by time interaction. The time point by time point comparison between the mean total symptom severity scores for the 2 groups was conducted via linear contrast. Statistical inference was determined by the magnitude of the Wald \u03c72 statistic. The rejection of the null hypothesis of no effect was at the P \u2a7d.05 level of significance. Confidence interval construction for the group mean and the ratio of the group means were based on the Wald normal approximation, and the limits were determined at the 95% level of confidence. All of the statistical computation were performed with the PROC GENMOD procedure on SAS software, version 8.0 (SAS Institute).",

The 24-, 48-, 72-, and 96-h symptom severity score frequency distributions from the experimental challenge studies were compared with the day 1, 2, 3, and 4 symptom severity score frequency distributions from the natural cold study with use of the nonparametric log-rank \u03c72 test [15]. The log-rank test was used to evaluate whether the empirical cumulative distributions (ECDs) of the scores of the respective study groups were equal at corresponding points in time. The values of the ECD were determined from the empirical distribution function ecdf(y) = #(scores \u2a7d score y)/n [16], and, for any particular observed score y, the value of the ecdf represented the proportion of the observed symptom severity scores that had a value less than or equal to that particular score. When the empirical distribution function was evaluated over all of the observed symptom severity scores of a particular group, this provided an estimate for the cumulative distribution [17] of the scores for the study population represented by that particular group. The 95% CI construction for estimating the upper and lower bound of the population cumulative distribution was based on a 100 (1 - \u03b1/2k) Bonferroni criterion, in which the value \u03b1 represented the type 1 error rate, and the value k represented the number of unique cut points at which the cumulative probability was evaluated. Bonferroni confidence limits were used to attain 95% CIs with the specified coverage probability. This required taking into account the inherent correlation between the succession of values of the ECD. A type 1 error rate of 0.05 was used in the 95% CI construction; therefore, the overall simultaneous coverage probability was \u223c95%. All of the statistical computations for the analysis of the distributions of the total symptom severity scores were performed with Splus, version 2000 (Insightful).",

The data point representing the score at the time of reporting for enrollment (day 1) in the natural cold study was shifted to day 2 and that of day 2 to day 3, et cetera (figure 1B). The mean symptom score for the natural cold group of 6.8 reported on day 1 aligned with the 48-h experimental mean symptom score of 6.6. With this adjustment, the mean symptom score at 48 h in the experimental cold group was comparable to the mean symptom score on day 1 in the natural cold group (P =.7). The rate of decrease in the mean total symptom score from 48 h to 72 h for the experimental cold group was similar to the rate of decrease in the total mean symptom score for the natural cold group from day 1 to day 2 (P =.6). Similarly, the mean total symptom score for the experimental cold group at 72 h was comparable to the mean total symptom score for the natural cold group on day 2 (P =.4). The rate of decrease of the mean total symptom score from 72 h to 96 h for the experimental cold group was 1.25-fold greater (95% CI, 1.09-1.40-fold greater; P <.001) than the rate of decrease of the mean total symptom score for the natural cold group from 2 to day 3. At 96 h, the mean total symptom score for the experimental cold group was 3.8, which was significantly less (P =.004) than the mean symptom score of 5.1 for the natural cold group on day 3.",

This is especially true during the very early stages of a cold, which is the optimum time to begin treatment [7]. Because objective signs of an early cold are usually lacking, clinical trials of cold treatments rely primarily on subjective data obtained by history from the patient.

In this situation, some patients have heatedly denied the inaccuracy of the history and demanded to be enrolled into the study to receive payment. Of greater concern is the suspicion that some individuals may completely falsify an illness to gain entrance into a study. Financial incentive is not an issue in virus challenge studies in which volunteers are assured of payment regardless of the outcome of participation. Other reasons for delayed enrollment include patients who have honest doubts about whether a cold is beginning or who are too preoccupied with daily activities to notice early mild symptoms. However, people can recognize early cold symptoms. One study showed that, in 81% of patients with natural colds, the interval between the initial symptom and when the individual \u201cknew he had a cold\u201d was \u2a7d16 h [19].",
