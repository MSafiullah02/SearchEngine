Lectures covered the biology of avian pathogens and diagnostic symptoms of major avian diseases; hands-on workshops trained participants in phlebotomy for disease testing, smears for blood parasites, and necropsy protocol. Subjects were domestic chickens from local farms and Rock Pigeons (Columba livia) from extermination programs, on the human-inhabited islands of Santa Cruz and San Cristobal. In addition, we began the field surveys of natural populations of endemic birds. During the first two years, plasma and serum samples, blood smears, and cloacal swabs were sampled from Waved Albatrosses (Phoebastria irrorata), endemic to the island of Espa\u00f1ola (Padilla et al. 2003); Gal\u00e1pagos Hawks (Buteo galapagoensis) from eight islands; Gal\u00e1pagos Doves (Zenaida galapagoensis) from five islands (three uninhabited by humans and two inhabited; Padilla et al. 2004); and from Gal\u00e1pagos Penguins (Spheniscus mendiculus) and Gal\u00e1pagos Flightless Cormorants (Phalacrocorax harrisi) across their narrow ranges within the archipelago (Travis et al. 2006a, b). Sampling was later extended to other species (see below). These endemic species were chosen because we were already involved in studies of their population biology and genetics. They represented two terrestrial species (one of which is the apex predator on the islands) and three marine species (one of which is pelagic and covers huge distances, the other two of which are flightless), and so could be seen as sentinel species for a large proportion of the ecological zones inhabited by birds in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. In addition, all are relatively large- bodied, so sufficient samples could be taken to test for several pathogens. These ongoing population studies provided a background against which data on disease could be interpreted more fully. For example, our population-genetics studies show that the Gal\u00e1pagos Hawk is the most recent arrival of the endemic vertebrates on the archipelago (Bollmer et al. 2006), that since its arrival it has diversified rapidly among island populations, and that individuals very rarely move among islands (Bollmer et al. 2005). By contrast, the genes of Gal\u00e1pagos Doves move freely among the islands of the main archipelago (Santiago-Alarc\u00f3n et al. 2006). Similar studies are underway for the penguins and cormorants. These data contribute to understanding the timing of arrival of hosts and their host-specific pathogens, their historical interisland movements, and the current dynamics of transmission of pathogens among islands and species. For example, comparison of hawks and doves suggests that the doves are far more likely to distribute pathogens among islands.",

This person is present in the event of outbreaks and receives carcasses reported to the station, and is involved in a year-round training program for Ecuadorian veterinarians and veterinary pathologists on the islands. We broadened the field survey to include four seabird species on Genovesa and other island populations of landbirds. Upon capture, birds are handled briefly while morphological measures are made and ocular, choanal, and cloacal swabs are taken. Blood samples (\u22641% body weight) are taken, and two smears are made on the spot. One drop of blood is preserved in lysis buffer for genetic analyses, whereas the remainder is spun in the field and plasma or serum frozen in liquid nitrogen. Later, samples and tissues are examined by serological tests, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), microscopy, and histopathology (on chickens and Rock Pigeons euthanized humanely as part of the extermination program, or on tissues from animals found dead) for complete blood counts, serum chemistry panel, and tests for enteric pathogens (Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter spp.), Chlamydophila, as well as for avian cholera, avian influenza, Newcastle disease, Paramyxovirus 2 and 3, West Nile Virus, infectious bronchitis, avian adenovirus, avian encephalomyelitis virus, avian reovirus, Marek's disease, and infectious bursal disease. Blood smears were examined for hemoparasites in all species, and positives were further examined by PCR for identification (Escalante et al. 1998, Ricklefs and Fallon 2002, Fallon et al. 2003). Introduced and endemic doves were tested for Trichomonas gallinae.",

Although dust-ruffling does not remove all ectoparasites (e.g., many mites), it is relatively noninvasive and allows a good estimation of ectoparasite infection intensity and prevalence (Walther and Clayton 1997). Ectoparasites are placed in 95\u2013100% ethanol and stored at \u221220\u00b0C to ensure DNA preservation. DNA is extracted from exemplars from each host species or population, depending on the particular requirements of the study. A voucher method, in which an exoskeleton is retained as a voucher specimen, is used (Cruickshank et al. 2001, Whiteman et al. 2004). In the case of hippoboscid flies or other relatively large arthropods, a single leg is removed. DNA is extracted and used as a source of template DNA for PCRs. Arthropod-specific PCR primers are then used to amplify and sequence loci to be used in population or phylogenetic studies (e.g., the 5\u2032 end of the cytochrome-c oxidase subunit I [COI] is used as a DNA barcode; Hebert et al. 2003). Thus, identifications of ectoparasites are made using a combination of morphological and molecular characters.",

For example, with our collaborator, Kevin P. Johnson, we genotyped Gal\u00e1pagos Dove lice (Columbicola macrourae and Physconelloides galapagensis) that moved horizontally to Gal\u00e1pagos Hawks after the hawks fed upon the doves and showed that the dove lice were indeed derived from the local Gal\u00e1pagos Dove and were not a typical part of the hawk's ectoparasite community (Whiteman et al. 2004). Genotyping was necessary because female lice of these species are indistinguishable from some congeners. In the same study, we genotyped a louse nymph (Bovicola sp.) collected from a Gal\u00e1pagos Hawk that presumably moved from a goat carcass on which the hawks were feeding. In addition to providing additional characters for identification, DNA sequence data also allow estimation of relationships among Gal\u00e1pagoan taxa and their mainland relatives and estimation of gene flow of parasites among islands, a distinctly evolutionary approach that can build from and then inform the veterinary findings.",

Moreover, microparasites (e.g., Haemoproteus, microfilariae, Trypanosoma, avipoxvirus) obtained from avian blood, swabs, or biopsy are identified by extracting DNA (host and parasite) from host tissue samples (e.g., blood or skin biopsies) and PCR- amplifying loci used to test for presence or absence (and then to calculate prevalence). Additionally, the amplicons from a subset of positive samples from each avian population are sequenced using standard techniques (e.g., cytochrome-b oxidase mitochondrial DNA [mtDNA] for haemoproteids; Fallon et al. 2003). Macroendoparasites are extracted using a method similar to the above when possible (preserving a part of the parasite as a voucher). All specimens are labeled fully and deposited in the appropriate institutions. Representatives of all lineages are deposited into the invertebrate collection at the Charles Darwin Research Station after all data have been collected (e.g., DNA sequencing, morphometrics, photographs).",

Eventually, our goal is to create a public database of all DNA sequences obtained from exemplars of all parasite taxa studied within the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, with all available data on host, habitat, and collection information linked to the sequences, which will allow rapid determination of whether a given parasite has been recovered previously from a given host and locality.

These 36 island populations, for which at least 20 individuals have been sampled, represent 22.5% of the 160 island populations of all seabirds and landbirds endemic at the species or subspecies level. Other endemics are represented by single specimens on which necropsy results are reported (e.g., Blue-footed Booby [Sula nebouxii] and Brown Pelican [Pelecanus occidentalis]). In most species, previously undescribed or new host records of previously known parasites were recovered (Table 1); in a few cases, results for particular focal species revealed no remarkable findings. For example, the single breeding population of Waved Albatross contained no remarkable findings, which allows us to characterize normal ranges for plasma chemistry, serology, and hematology (Padilla et al. 2003). In other cases, we were better able to characterize pathogens previously known to be present, such as Avipoxvirus (see below). Major pathogen findings are summarized briefly here in broad categories.",

The results of a BLAST search of the sequences were conclusive.

Chlamydophila psittaci antibodies were also detected at high prevalence in Gal\u00e1pagos Penguin; lower prevalences of C. psittaci in the sympatric Gal\u00e1pagos Cormorant may have reflected the different testing methodologies used. Chlamydophila DNA was detected in several cormorants, but in no penguins (Travis et al. 2006a, b). Histopathology of cutaneous lesions from chickens, Yellow Warblers, and ground finches (Geospiza spp.) revealed inclusion bodies diagnostic of Avipoxvirus spp. Our characterization of the poxvirus in endemic passerine birds revealed two variants very closely related to canarypox virus, whereas domestic chickens on the islands are infected with the distinct fowl- pox virus (Thiel et al. 2005). This suggests that the poxvirus did not \u201cjump\u201d from chickens to the endemic birds. Canarypox variants may also be endemic, perhaps arriving with avian colonists that gave rise to the endemic Gal\u00e1pagos avifauna, or transported by migrant passerines. Recombination analyses, however, indicated ancient recombination among all strains examined, which suggests that recombination could occur among sympatric Avipoxvirus strains in Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. Further phylogeographic studies of the virus in the endemic birds should clarify its closest relatives on the mainland.",

Most data on the effects of avian pox are from mockingbirds (Nesomimus spp.). During the 1982-1983 El Ni\u00f1o event, 56% of Gal\u00e1pagos Mockingbirds displaying lesions died on Genovesa, compared with 39% of asymptomatic individuals (Curry and Grant 1989). During the same El Ni\u00f1o event on Isla Santa Cruz, 28% of juvenile Gal\u00e1pagos Mockingbirds exhibited apparent pox lesions; young birds without symptoms had higher resighting frequencies (72%) than those with lesions (0%), which suggested higher mortality for infected birds (Vargas 1987). Our work has barely begun to consider the health consequences of parasites and pathogens on their hosts. Hemoparasites in Haemoproteus have been traditionally considered incidental and relatively nonpathogenic parasites of birds and reptiles, though effects on host fitness have been demonstrated (Earl\u00eb et al. 1993, Merino et al. 2000, Marzal et al. 2005) and pathogenicity has been shown for certain hosts of certain hemoparasite species (Garvin et al. 2003). The pathogenicity of these parasites in the seabirds and doves sampled, or the effects on host fitness or reproductive success, are unknown. However, within Great Frigatebirds, birds infected with Haemoproteus-like parasites exhibited significantly higher heterophil-to- lymphocyte concentration ratios than uninfected birds (Padilla et al. 2006). In chickens, this ratio increased when birds were exposed to social stress or corticosterone in feed, and it is thus considered to be an indication of environmental stress (Gross and Siegel 1983). In our studies, blood smears from each bird are used to identify circulating parasites and to conduct complete cell counts (i.e., heterophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils), and estimate concentrations of overall leukocytes, each leukocyte type, and heterophil-to- lymphocyte concentration ratios. Haptoglobin, an acute phase protein found in birds and other taxa (Delers et al. 1988), will be quantified using a serum assay available through Tri-Delta Diagnostics (Morris Plains, New Jersey) that we have used with success. Haptoglobin increases during inflammatory responses to trauma or infection. Blood chemistries will be quantified through commercial labs (Padilla et al. 2003, 2004, 2006; Travis et al. 2006a, b). We will compare these measures of response in infected and noninfected hosts within each species, and compare these differentials between \u201cold\u201d and \u201crecent\u201d parasites, as identified in our phylo- geographic studies. For high-prevalence parasites in particular populations, we will return to estimate resighting rates of hosts between years to estimate parasite-related mortality. Eventually, we and our colleagues would like to experimentally treat nesting nonthreatened birds (e.g., Great Frigatebirds) with antimalarial drugs to determine their ecological cost (e.g., Merino et al. 2000, Marzal et al. 2005). We are presently studying how removing lice from banded Gal\u00e1pagos Hawks affects the hawks' long-term survivorship.",

            "text": "We will also use these results to estimate consequences of parasite infection for other components of fitness in the endemic avifauna of Gal\u00e1pagos. These studies will make connections back to our original interests in behavioral characteristics of island fauna. We will ask, for example, whether parasite infection affects the red coloration of the Red-footed Booby's (S. Sula) feet, and whether this, in turn, affects mating success (P. Baiao pers. comm.). We know that the high prevalence of adenovirus seropositivity in the Waved Albatross is not related to their pairing or reproductive success (K. P. Huyvaert pers. comm.), but we are aware that some of these disease organisms may have adverse fitness consequences for their hosts in a manner that is mediated through behavioral mechanisms such as pairing success or foraging efficiency, even when direct effects on morbidity are difficult to assess. For example, we have studied the ecto- parasitic lice Degeeriella regalis and Colpocephalum turbinatum of the endemic Gal\u00e1pagos Hawk. Number of lice per infected host correlates negatively with body condition and predicts territory status, such that nonterritorial birds carry higher parasite loads and are in poorer condition than territorial birds, even after controlling for age (Whiteman and Parker 2004a). New data suggest that newcomers to polyandrous Gal\u00e1pagos Hawk breeding groups on Santiago have significantly more lice than birds that have resided in the territories for at least one year, which is likely correlated with the newer birds' recent status as nonterritorial individuals (N. K. Whiteman et al. unpubl. data). In addition, the intensity of infection with the horizontally transmitted louse, C. turbinatum, varied positively with size of the infected Gal\u00e1pagos Hawk's social group, and intensity was significantly more similar within groups than between groups. This was not true for the vertically transmitted D. regalis (Whiteman and Parker 2004b). Colpocephalum turbinatum is the same louse that is useful for indicating relative immune function of different populations, because it encounters the immune system when it feeds on skin and growing feathers. We asked whether genetic diversity, parasite load, and immune function were related across all the breeding populations of the Gal\u00e1pagos Hawk, employing our quantitative sampling of C. turbinatum, estimates of island-population genetic diversity (Bollmer et al. 2005), and tests of natural constitutive antibodies (Matson et al. 2005) run on banked serum samples from the same individuals. We found that island populations of Gal\u00e1pagos Hawks with extremely little genetic diversity also have generally lower and less variable natural antibody titres and higher ectoparasite loads than larger, more genetically variable island populations (Whiteman et al. 2006). This reinforces the hypothesis that extinction risk of island endemics is attributable to mechanisms associated with reduced genetic diversity (Frankham 1996). Because of this finding, we recommended that the Gal\u00e1pagos National Park consider further restricting tourist visitation to the more isolated smaller islands, given that Gal\u00e1pagos Hawks on those islands are likely more susceptible to invasive diseases that may enter the archipelago.",

            "text": "Parasites that are not directly affected by host immune function reveal other aspects of the host-parasite interaction. Degeeriella regalis is a feather louse that occurs, within the islands, only on Gal\u00e1pagos Hawks. On the mainland, it occurs with regularity only on the Gal\u00e1pagos Hawk's putative sister species, the Swainson's Hawk (B. swainsoni; Riesing et al. 2003). This parasite is likely transmitted vertically between host individuals (Whiteman and Parker 2004a), transferring between parents and offspring during brooding. Comparative molecular data (N. K. Whiteman et al. unpubl. data) suggest that the parasite's mtDNA was diversifying more quickly than the host's under an island model of speciation (Hafner and Nadler 1990). We conservatively estimated that the Gal\u00e1pagos Hawk split from its common ancestor with the Swainson's Hawk <200,000 years BP and is, thus, the youngest known endemic bird lineage with the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands (Bollmer et al. 2006). The signature of a population bottleneck in the hawk lineage is seen at rapidly evolving nuclear minisatellite loci, which are nearly fixed within and different between island populations of the Gal\u00e1pagos Hawk (Bollmer et al. 2005) and in the mtDNA haplotype network, which shows very little polymorphism, yet high structure (Bollmer et al. 2006). However, the parasite mtDNA network shows much more structure between and variability within island populations (N. K. Whiteman et al. unpubl. data). Because it is vertically transmitted and highly host-specific, such parasites act as rapidly evolving \u201cmarkers\u201d that provide more insight into host history than we can get from the hosts themselves. The parasite network reveals aspects of host history (which haplotypes are derived from which ancestral haplotype), and we used this logic as a new rationale for parasite conservation (Whiteman and Parker 2005).",

            "text": "Surprisingly, our parasite surveys are among the first to examine parasite diversification within the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, and the data gathered by our biotic inventory will be of use to scientists for decades. Our ongoing work will continue to uncover parasite lineages new to science. For example, there are no published reports of Phthiraptera from the following endemic birds, though each is a likely host to at least one species (Price et al. 2003): Lava Gull (L. fuliginosus), Gal\u00e1pagos Rail (Laterallus spilonotus), eight species of Darwin's finches (Geospiza spp.), three mockingbird species (Nesomimus spp.), Gal\u00e1pagos Martin (Progne modesta), Gal\u00e1pagos subspecies of the Short-eared Owl (Asio flammeus), and others. Although two species of lice were reported previously from the Gal\u00e1pagos Hawk (de Vries 1973), our sampling (after receiving a tip from R. Palma) revealed that a previously undetected head louse, Craspedorrhynchus sp. (all in this genus are specific to raptors), which occurred in all island populations sampled, likely represents an endemic lineage. The detection of cryptic diversification within the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, in addition to new species or new records, is certain. For example, an epidermoptid skin mite (a member of a family in which no DNA sequence data existed before our preliminary study), Myialges caulotoon, was previously reported from Flightless Cormorants and Gal\u00e1pagos Hawks, both Gal\u00e1pagos endemics (Madden and Harmon 1998). These mites have caused significant mortality in wild birds elsewhere, including an island endemic (Gilardi et al. 2001). Previously, however, only one specimen was collected from a Flightless Cormorant, and only morphological characters were used to identify these mites (Madden and Harmon 1998). Female mites of the genus Myialges are obligately vectored by hippoboscid flies or large chewing louse species (Fain 1965) and oviposit only on the insects. However, different species of flies infest Flightless Cormorants and Gal\u00e1pagos Hawks (Maa 1963, N. K. Whiteman et al. unpubl. data). Thus, we hypothesized that gene flow of the mites between avian hosts was limited given the host-specificity of their fly vectors. We showed that individuals of Myialges from Flightless Cormorants and Gal\u00e1pagos Hawks differed significantly genetically even in areas where those two species co-occurred (e.g., Isla Fernandina). Our collaborator and expert on the Acari, H. Klompen, found consistent morphological differences between the series from each host, demonstrating the reciprocal illumination with morphological and molecular data to uncover new parasite lineages.",

Island populations may be particularly influenced by introduced pathogens because of their evolution in isolation, low levels of genetic heterogeneity, and increased population densities, all of which increase their susceptibility to new diseases and disease transmission among individuals. Also, island populations naturally tend to be small, making them more vulnerable to extinction. In addition, the parasites themselves are of extreme intrinsic value and interest. This partnership is describing the prevalence of parasites in terrestrial bird species and seabirds on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, assessing the history and origin of those parasite lineages, and beginning to assess the relative effects of recent and historical parasites on their hosts. In addition, we can use the empirical clinical data on health of individuals to inform our behavioral-ecology studies of mate choice, territory acquisition, reproductive success, and patterns of movement. These results may contribute importantly to other conservation efforts in other parts of the world. The results will also contribute a new dimension to the role that the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago has served as evolution's laboratory by revealing the diversity of parasites that have evolved there, and are enabling us to begin quantifying the effects of both endemic and introduced parasites and pathogens.",
