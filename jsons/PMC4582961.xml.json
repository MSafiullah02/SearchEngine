            "text": "Classification of CD4+ T cells, according to cytokine production and gene expression, defines distinct subsets but struggles to convey the complex and dynamic nature of T-cell function. Polarization of responses is such a central concept that the very language of T-cell biology is built around it. In 1986 Mosmann, Coffman and colleagues classified T helper cell clones according to their distinct patterns of cytokine secretion, and coined the terms Th1 and Th2 establishing the basis for classification as distinct or non-overlapping function.1 This framework fulfils the basic desire of most biologists to bring order to the world armed only with a dichotomous key and relies on exclusivity to determine position: a Th1 cell, for example, should produce interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) but not interleukin-4 (IL-4), whereas the polar opposite is true of a Th2 cell. Newly described T helper cell subsets have joined this exclusive club and distinct patterns of cytokine secretion, under the direction of a subset-specific master regulator of transcription, remain the reference standard for membership. Master-regulators of transcription have been identified for Th1 (T-bet), Th2 (Gata3), Th17 (ROR-\u03b3T), follicular helper T (Bcl6) and regulatory T (Treg; Foxp3) cells and they promote lineage commitment by driving the expression of subset-signature genes and repressing genes associated with alternative fates.2 However, while the defining feature of Th1 and Th2 subsets was their distinction, Th17 cells can be induced to co-express T-bet and ROR-\u03b3T and produce both IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3, blurring the lines between Th1 and Th17 function.3\u20135 The functional plasticity of Th17 cells redefined our understanding of T-cell subsets, and requires a more fluid framework able to accommodate dynamic changes in transcription factor expression, cytokine production and inflammatory potential in response to environmental conditions. Such plasticity is not restricted to T helper subsets. Treg cells co-expressing effector-associated transcription factors along with Foxp3 and capable of producing pro-inflammatory cytokines are also found in mice and humans (Table1). What is the purpose of such multifunctional cells and what are the implications for Treg cells in the control of homeostasis, inflammation and therapy?",

The noble mission statement of Treg cells \u2018to prevent autoimmunity, immunopathology and maintain homeostasis\u2019 is so often cited that it overshadows alternative functions. Perhaps Treg multi-functionality should not come as such a surprise. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) promotes differentiation of both Treg and Th17 cells and the decision between these alternative fates is influenced by the prevailing cytokine milieu: IL-6 promotes Th17 development via activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), whereas IL-2-driven activation of STAT5 favours Treg cell induction.6\u20139 Foxp3 and ROR-\u03b3T are co-expressed during the polarization of Th17 cells, but IL-6 promotes down-regulation of Foxp3 and, in concert with IL-1, drives Th17 differentiation.10 Both IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 can also induce IL-17 production in Treg cells10,11 (Table.1).",

In contrast, the expression of Gata3 in Treg cells is neither induced by Th2-associated cytokines, nor normally associated with elevated Th2-cytokine production by Treg cells. Gata3 is expressed at higher levels in Treg cells than naive T cells in the steady state29 and promotes Foxp3 expression.29 Indeed, Gata3 has an essential role in Treg function, Gata3 deficient Treg cells are unable to prevent the development of T-cell-mediated colitis and Treg-specific deletion of Gata3 results in spontaneous autoimmune disease.29,30 During both infection and autoimmunity Gata3 supports and maintains Treg function at diverse inflammatory sites29,30 whereas in the steady state Gata3+ Treg cells are prevalent in gut-associated lymphoid tissues, suggesting an important role in homeostasis at barrier sites.30 By interacting directly with Foxp3, Gata3 can suppress ROR-\u03b3 expression and IL-17 production,29\u201331 thereby restraining the pro-inflammatory potential of Treg cells (see below). Gata3 expression in Treg cells is induced by T-cell receptor (TCR) activation and IL-2, independently of STAT6 and IL-4/IL-13.30 Therefore, unlike T-bet or ROR-\u03b3T, Gata3 is not induced in response to effector cytokines but by the survival factor IL-2.30 This may underpin both the general importance of Gata3 to Treg function and the ability of IL-2 to prevent production of IL-17 by Treg cells (see Table1).",

Treg cells producing Th2 cytokines remained absent from peripheral blood but a higher proportion of Treg cells isolated from skin biopsies from systemic sclerosis patients produced IL-13 and IL-4 than in the skin of healthy control subjects.33 These studies emphasize the need to study the behaviour of Treg cells in tissues and at inflammatory interfaces, and show that Treg cells have the potential to produce cytokines, which may contribute to fibrotic as well as acute inflammation.",

An essential role for T-bet in Treg function is not immediately apparent; T-bet-deficient Treg cells show no functional defect in in vitro suppression assays.35,36 T-bet-deficient mice do not have an altered frequency of Treg cells,35,36 nor do they develop spontaneous autoimmunity or an exacerbated form of induced organ-specific disease.37 This all suggests that T-bet expression is not required for Treg function. However, in models of Th1 inflammation (anti-CD40 treatment, or infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis19) T-bet-deficient Treg cells compete inefficiently with their wild-type counterparts in terms of proliferation and access to inflamed tissue. Hence, in chimeric mice (harbouring both wild-type and T-bet-deficient T cells) with mycobacterial infection, T-bet-deficient Treg cells are disadvantaged in their capacity to home to the inflamed lung. The diminished migratory potential of T-bet-deficient Treg cells results from their lack of CXCR3 expression, which renders them unable to respond to CXCL10 induced by IFN-\u03b3 during infection.19 Once Treg cells have gained entry to the inflammatory site, IFN-\u03b3 can increase their IL-10 production, thereby further enhancing their suppressive capacity.27",

Indeed the elevated suppressive functions seen in Th1-conditioned Treg cells (activated via STAT1), in IL-10-exposed Treg cells (activated via STAT3) and in IRF4+ Treg cells42 can all be attributed to increased IL-10 production, rather than to distinct subset-specific suppressive mechanisms.

In the steady-state around 30% of Treg cells express Gata3 and around 10% express T-bet.

For example, the \u2018alarmin\u2019 IL-33 which is released during necrotic cell death regulates Treg dynamics in vivo and this pathway is of particular importance at inflammatory sites.46\u201348 A subset of highly activated Treg cells express ST2 (the IL-33 receptor) and respond to IL-33 with increased proliferation, activation and elevated Gata3 expression. Interleukin-33 also increased expression of molecules involved in tissue homing (CD103, \u03b1V integrin, OX40, CD44) and suppressive function (CTLA-4, PD-1, CD39, CD73, LAG3).48,49 These results suggest that IL-33 promotes expansion of Treg cells capable of homing to sites of inflammation and displaying increased suppressive capacity. Indeed, ST2+ Treg cells may be particularly well adapted to survival in tissues as they are enriched in fat, muscle and skin compared with secondary lymphoid organs.33,50,51 Notably, the Gata3-promoting activity of IL-33 is suppressed by IL-23, demonstrating a further way in which IL-23 can act to destabilize the Treg phenotype.48 ST2\u2212/\u2212 Treg cells also fail to protect against T-cell-induced colitis, an inadequacy also seen in Gata3\u2212/\u2212 Treg cells.29,30 As IL-33 is constitutively expressed in epithelial and endothelial cells, this pathway represents a novel means whereby cells out-with the immune system can act to promote Treg stability and function during inflammation and one which might be of particular importance at barrier sites. ST2 expression is also an essential feature of Treg cells found in visceral adipose tissue. This ST2 expression was dependent on IRF4, highlighting a further key influence of Treg function, and basic leucine zipper transcription factor ATF-like (BATF). Interestingly, both of these transcriptional regulators are responsive to IL-33, allowing a positive feedback loop for the propagation of highly functional Treg cells.52",

The proportion of Treg cells induced to produce IL-17 in vitro never equals the level of induction seen following stimulation of naive T cells in the presence of TGF-\u03b2 and IL-6.7,11 The differential sensitivity of naive conventional T cells and Treg cells to IL-6 reflects their differential patterns of IL-6Ra expression (only around 30% of Treg cells express IL-6Ra). Highly activated Treg cells are IL-6Ra-negative, fail to phosphorylate STAT3 in response to IL-638 and cannot be induced to produce IL-17.9 Therefore reduced sensitivity to IL-6 in Treg cells at inflammatory sites can serve as a potent means of stabilizing their suppressive function. Underlining this, Treg cells isolated from the inflamed CNS during EAE are insensitive to IL-6 because they do not express either IL-6Ra, or the signal transducing sub-unit gp130. In contrast, splenic Treg cells from the same mice do express IL-6 receptors and are capable of IL-6-driven IL-17 production.38 In a parallel situation, IL-1R1 expression identifies a subset of CCR6+ ROR-\u03b3T+ human Treg cells that can produce IL-17 in response to IL-1\u03b2.53 Acquisition of Th1-like cytokine production in murine Treg cells requires intact IFN-\u03b3-signalling. Exposure to IFN-\u03b3 also induces IL-12RB2 expression, allowing IL-12 to further promote T-bet expression.27 Hence, patterns of cytokine receptor expression can identify populations of Treg cells with a predisposition to effector-cytokine production.",

As mentioned previously, transfer of Foxp3+ Treg cells to a lymphopenic environment results in loss of Foxp3 expression in a proportion of Treg cells. However, if Treg cells are sorted into CD25+ and CD25\u2212 fractions before transfer, the CD25+ fraction retains stable Foxp3 expression, whereas Foxp3 is readily lost from the CD25\u2212 fraction.59 Notably, loss of Foxp3 was not permanent as activation of ex-Treg cells in vivo or in vitro could re-induce Foxp3 expression in those studies. A highly sensitive reporter system (in which membrane-bound human CD2 is expressed on the surface of T cells expressing Foxp3) demonstrated that, during activation, a small proportion of murine T cells transiently up-regulate Foxp3 expression.58 Hence, the \u2018ex-Treg\u2019 population identified in previous studies is not composed solely of Treg cells that have lost Foxp3 expression but could well be accounted for in large part by cells that have abortively or transiently expressed Foxp3 during activation.",

After transfer of Treg cells into Rag2\u2212/\u2212 mice, a proportion of cells lose Foxp3 expression. Upon secondary transfer into TCR-\u03b2\u2212/\u2212 mice Foxp3\u2212 cells gained effector function and induced autoimmune inflammation.54 Importantly, inflammatory cytokine production increased only after transfer of the ex-Treg to the second lymphopenic host. The presence of stable Treg cells (which retained their suppressive capacity) in the primary transfer is therefore sufficient to prevent gain of effector function by ex-Treg cells, even after loss of Foxp3. This is also true in models using autoreactive Treg cells from transgenic mice. After transfer of BDC2.5 Treg cells to TCRa\u2212/\u2212 hosts, around a third of these cells lost Foxp3 expression and gained a capacity for IFN-\u03b3 production. Despite this, recipient mice did not develop diabetes.55 Sorting of ex-Treg cells followed by their in vitro expansion before transfer to NOD Rag2\u2212/\u2212 mice was required to induce diabetes.55 Similarly, in vitro expansion of ex-Treg cells from CNS autoantigen-immunized mice, generated a population of ex-Treg cells capable of inducing EAE after transfer to sub-lethally irradiated hosts.56 Hence there is no evidence for ex-Treg cells initiating disease on a primary transfer without immunization. Most often, in vitro55,56 or in vivo54 activation in the complete absence of other T cells is required for ex-Treg cells to gain full effector function. Although they may sound unusual, such conditions are directly relevant to the potential therapeutic application of Treg cells, particularly for treatment of graft versus host disease, where in vitro expanded Treg cells are transferred following bone marrow transplantation (reviewed in ref. 75).",

This would require selective deletion of the capacity for effector cytokine production in Treg cells. Using the same techniques employed to determine the role of Teff-associated transcription factors, but deleting only effector cytokines, it would be possible to allow unimpaired regulation of bona-fide Teff responses while eliminating effector function in Treg and ex-Treg cells. Of course, it is possible (and perhaps likely) that removing effector function in a minor population of cytokine-producing cells would have a limited effect on the clinical course of disease, especially in EAE where global deletion of either IFN-\u03b376 or IL-1777 does not prevent development of disease. However, a demonstration of reduced pathology in the absence of effector function specifically in Treg cells would provide the most convincing demonstration that Treg cells can contribute to, as well as suppress, inflammation. The best evidence to date that cells which have expressed Foxp3 can contribute to inflammation comes from adoptive transfer of CD25lo Foxp3+ (unstable) Treg cells from collagen-immunized DBA-1 mice into previously immunized DBA-1 hosts before secondary immunization.13 This protocol resulted in an earlier onset of arthritis in recipient mice. Notably transfer of CD25hi Foxp3+ Treg cells did not accelerate pathology, this supports the concept of Treg heterogeneity and indicates that CD25hi cells are stable, fully committed Treg cells.",

However, this again required serial transfer into secondary lymphopenic hosts.81 When transferred to lymphoreplete hosts, even large numbers of IFN-\u03b3+ myelin-reactive ex-iTreg cells failed to induce EAE, emphasizing the importance of the environment in setting the threshold for pathogenic potential.79 Inducible Treg cells can also produce granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) upon secondary stimulation,82 which is of relevance given the central role of this cytokine in EAE.83,84 However, production of GM-CSF by iTreg cells is susceptible to inhibition by IL-6, IL-27, IL-2 and TGF-\u03b2. Hence, although iTreg cells are prone to lose Foxp3 expression, they retain some suppressive activity and cross-regulation by cytokines produced by conventional T cells and antigen-presenting cells inhibits their pro-inflammatory potential in immunocompetent hosts.82",

As mentioned above, this intronic cis-element plays a key role in maintaining Foxp3 expression during active Treg proliferation89 and CNS2-deficient mice develop lymphoproliferative disease with multi-organ immune infiltration.90 CNS2 appears able to interact with the Foxp3 promoter via a short-distance loop, promoted through NFAT binding, providing a means by which TCR-stimulation can drive CNS2-mediated Foxp3-stabilization.90 A contemporaneous study of CNS2 suggested that, at least part of the functional consequence of the CNS2-Foxp3 promoter interaction was to deliver STAT5 to the promoter, thereby facilitating the action of IL-2 on Foxp3-stability. Moreover, in the absence of CNS2, the loss of Foxp3 upon exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines was enhanced.91 This leads to a model in which pro-inflammatory STATs (e.g. STAT3 and STAT6) can deliver DNA methyltransferases that would extinguish Foxp3 gene transcription, an outcome that is prevented by the concerted actions of TCR stimulation, IL-2/STAT5 signalling and CNS2 function. Importantly, as these studies showed, the two net effects in Treg cells are maintained Foxp3 expression and resistance to gain of effector cytokine production.90,91",

Down-regulation of Eos is induced by IL-6 and can be blocked by the immunoregulatory enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which is produced in large amounts by plasmacytoid dendritic cells in tumour-draining lymph nodes. Inhibition of IDO increases IL-17-production by Treg cells and promotes effective anti-tumour immunity.94,95 Similarly, overcoming Treg-mediated suppression by local delivery of IL-12 (in combination with CTLA-4 blockade) allows eradication of tumours in a murine model of glioblastoma.96 In colon cancer the frequency of ROR-\u03b3T+ IL-17+ Treg cells among peripheral blood mononuclear cells increases with the transition from stage II to stage III disease, indicating that this readout could be a useful biomarker of disease progression.97 Genetically polyp-prone mice also have an elevated frequency of ROR-\u03b3T Treg cells and deletion of ROR-\u03b3T specifically within Treg cells provides increased immunosurveillance and decreased polyposis, demonstrating its relevance to disease.97 These studies show that local modulation of Treg function (by either provision or inhibition of switch factor cytokines) provides a means to effectively modulate immune responses. Hence, when the clinical imperative is to alleviate the Treg-mediated suppression of beneficial anti-tumour immune responses, the capacity of IL-12 and IL-6 to destabilize Treg cells and promote plasticity could be manipulated therapeutically.",

In accordance with this remit, non-suppressive functions have been viewed in part as aberrant, deviant behaviours, despite the frequency with which they are reported. Thankfully however, these enigmatic cells were rightly named \u2018regulatory T cells\u2019. To live up to the name, their ability to adjust the mechanisms of the immune system must work both ways. Although the natural consequence of loss of suppressive function and gain of effector function in Treg cells is uncertain, a great deal of information has accrued on where and when it is likely to happen and which factors favour or inhibit conversion. Armed with this knowledge we are better positioned to design Treg-based therapies. For example, including strategies to promote functional stability after Treg transfer (via provision of IL-2), or locally altering Treg function to promote anti-tumour immunity. There is also increasing recognition of the roles of Treg cells in non-lymphoid organs to impact upon obesity50 and wound healing51,98 as well as their more traditionally recognized suppressive roles. The recent discovery that a subset of TIGIT+ Treg cells suppress the development of Th1 and Th17 responses while favouring Th2 polarization goes further and demonstrates that Treg cells can shape development of the adaptive immune response from the outset.99 As appreciation of their diverse functions grows, our understanding of Treg cells becomes less one-dimensional and the capacity to modulate immunity by targeting Treg function only looks set to increase.",
