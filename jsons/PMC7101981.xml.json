            "text": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinical arrhythmia associated with cardiovascular morbidity and increased mortality. Substantial evidence have demonstrated that activation of the local renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS), especially angiotensin II (Ang II), plays an important role in atrial remodeling characterized by interstitial fibrosis, and contributes to the onset and maintenance of AF in paced animal models [10, 13, 22, 32, 34, 42]. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-dependent increase in the levels of activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have been reported in atrial tissues of AF patients and animal models [1, 10, 13, 18, 22, 32, 36]. Experimental studies have proven that this increase in MAPKs, which has been suggested to have a crucial role in atrial fibrosis, can be reduced by treatment with ACE inhibitors [1, 18, 24, 36, 37]. MAPK phosphatase 1 (MKP-1), an important member of the dual-specificity phosphatase family, is a critical counteracting phosphatase that directly regulates the magnitude and duration of p38-MAPK and ERK auto-phosphorylation and activation [5]. MKP-1 is also expressed in cardiomyocytes and is involved in cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac hypertrophy [6]. Caunt et al. [5] found that MKP-1 negatively regulated the inflammatory response of the innate immune system by inhibiting MAPK activation. However, whether the dynamic regulation between MAPKs and MKP-1 participates in the pathophysiologic mechanism of cardiac remodeling, especially for atrial fibrotic remodeling, has not been established.",

Recent studies [15, 43] have shown that ACE2 overexpression could suppress Ang II-mediated myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis, and prevent cardiac dysfunction. However, the detailed signal transduction mechanism following the activation of Mas receptor induced by ACE2/ANG-(1\u20137) is still poorly understood; and the effects of ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137) on atrial structural remodeling are yet to be determined.",

Furthermore, the direct electrophysiological effects were antagonized by ACE inhibitors or Ang II receptor blockers in vitro and vivo studies [19, 29, 38, 40]. Of note, Ferreira et al. [14] found that Ang-(1\u20137) might have some antiarrhythmogenic effects during myocardial ischemic reperfusion. On the contrary, Donoghue et al. [12] reported that ACE2 overexpression by generating transgenic mice induces connexin dysregulation and results in profound electrophysiological disturbances. In fact, few studies investigated the effects of ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137) axis on ion channels remodeling, especially Ang II-related adverse electrical remodeling. With the deepened understanding of ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137) axis on cardiac structural remodeling, to explore the effects of ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137) axis on atrial ion channels remodeling and its detailed mechanism has important theoretical and practical value.",

A programmable pacemaker (Huanan Medical Technology Co., Ltd. Henan, China) was fixed on the back of dogs and attached to a pacing lead (St. Jude Medical) in the right atrial through external jugular vein. All dogs in the AF-Control, Ad-EGFP and Ad-ACE2 group were paced at 450 beats/min with the use of 0.2 ms square-wave pulses at twice-threshold current for a period of 14 days.

Each atrium was coated twice for 60 s each time, and approximately 5 min was allowed between paint coatings to permit absorption.

Eight basic drive stimuli were given, followed by a single premature stimulus, and all stimuli were set at twice the diastolic threshold. The S1S2 interval was increased in steps of 2 ms, and AERP was determined to be the shortest S1S2 interval that resulted in a propagated atrial response. The mean of three ERPs values at each BCL was used for data analysis. The inducibility of AF was evaluated by premature atrial stimulation during ERP measurement and atrial burst pacing lasting for 30 s at pacing cycle length of 100 ms. AF was considered inducible if the burst stimulus or S1\u2013S2 stimulus produced a rapid irregular rhythm faster than 400 beats/min lasting more than 10 s and associated with irregular atrioventricular conduction.

Recent data suggested that ACE inhibitors or Ang II receptor blockers had no protective effect against AERP shortening and did not abolish the rate adaptation in dogs receiving chronic atrial tachypacing, but attenuated the inducibility and duration of AF [22]. The latter was attributed to improvement of hemodynamic status and structural remodeling. Consistent with previous results [22, 26], our experiment also found that ACE2 overexpression had no preventive effect on the AERP shortening after 5 weeks of rapid atrial pacing, but decreased the AF inducibility and shortened AF duration, as well as significantly reducing atrial interstitial fibrosis. Therefore, the improvement of atrial interstitial fibrosis by ACE2 overexpression may be one of the important mechanisms of its therapeutic effects.",

Elevated levels of ACE and Ang II and up-regulation of profibrotic AT1R in the atrial myocardium have been reported in AF patients and animal models [13, 16]. For the endogenous negative regulation factors, Pan et al. [31] reported that ACE2 gene and protein expression in the fibrillating atria of pigs were significantly decreased compared with those in the sinus rhythm subjects. In the present study, local atrial RAS was found to be markedly activated in atrial-pacing dogs, as manifested by the increased expression levels of Ang II and AT1R, and decrease of ACE2, AT2R, Ang-(1\u20137), as well as the target of Ang-(1\u20137), Mas receptor; while atrial ACE2 overexpression could reverse these changes above. Together, these results suggest that atrial rapid pacing gives rise to local activation of RAS in atrial tissues and tips the balance between the protective axis of Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas and detrimental axis of Ang II/AT1R, while ACE2 overexpression in atrial tissue leads to a shift of the RAS balance towards the protective axis. We acknowledge that this study does not investigate the detailed molecular mechanism of the imbalance of RAS components, particularly the up-regulated or down-regulated mechanisms of those receptors, which might involve p38MAPK and ERK1/2 [20, 25], and needs to be further elucidated.",

Inhibitions of generations of Ang II can attenuate rapid atrial pacing or heart failure-induced MPAKs activation and atrial fibrosis [23]. Consistent with prior studies, the present study confirmed that ACE2 overexpression could suppress ERK1/2 and p38MAPK activation caused by rapid atrial pacing, followed by down-regulation of TGF-\u03b2 and collagen fibers, and subsequently ameliorate interstitial fibrosis. Furthermore, this beneficial effect of ACE2 overexpression was again associated with shifting of the RAS balance towards the protective axis.",

MKP-1 is a critical counteracting phosphatase that directly regulates the magnitude and duration of p38MAPK, as well as auto-phosphorylation and activation of Jun N-terminal kinase and ERK [5, 6, 27, 28]. Recently, McCollum et al. [27, 28] reported that Ang-(1\u20137) participated in maintaining cardiac homeostasis by reducing proliferation and collagen production by cardiac fibroblasts, associated with up-regulation of MKP-1 and down-regulation of MAPK phosphorylation. In agreement with these, our results for the first time indicated that ACE2 overexpression reversed the imbalance between MAPKs and MKP-1 induced by rapid atrial pacing, as manifested by down-regulation of MAPKs and up-regulation of MKP-1, and directly mediated downstream protective antifibrotic signals. Therefore, reversal of this imbalance may be a new therapeutic target of cardiac remodeling.",

            "text": "Atrial tachycardia remodeling alters ionic currents and gene expression of ion channels in a manner which plays a critical role in shaping the atrial action potential and promotes the occurrence of AF [29]. Reductions in atrial myocyte I\nCaL and Ito current resulting in action potential duration shortening and loss of its rate adaptation have been reported in both human and animal tachycardia-induced atrial remodeling [4, 29, 41]. A reduction in potassium channels gene expression has been reported as an adaptation mechanism serving to prolong the initially reduced AERP and action potential duration [34]. From gene and protein expression profile, the present results firstly demonstrated a significant reduction of mRNA expression of Cav1.2 and Kv4.2 in atrial tachypacing dogs, as well as their corresponding coding protein L-type Ca++ CP \u03b11C and Kv4.2/4.3 protein, respectively. Meanwhile, ACE2 overexpression could reverse decreased Kv4.2 expression level induced by atrial tachypacing (AF-control and Ad-EGFP group), but had no changes on the expression level of Cav1.2mRNA and its coding protein when compared with AF-control dogs. In another canine model of AF after atrial tachycardia, Liu et al. reported that Ang-(1\u20137) prevented atrial tachycardia-induced decrease in current density of Ito and I\nCaL, and shortened 90 % action potential duration [35]. However, similar to our findings, Ang-(1\u20137) did not prevent the decrease of Cav1.2 mRNA level. In fact, it is generally known that I\nCaL down-regulation is a major contributor to the decrease in action potential duration and refractoriness linked with AF [9]. Therefore, these findings might be able to explain no significant difference in terms of AERP observed between AF-control and Ad-ACE2 group. Of note, other Ca2+ handling proteins and ion channel proteins, such as RyR2, Serca2a, Calsequestrin, NCX1, can be implicated in atrial repolarization and electrical remodeling except I\nCaL [9, 39]; moreover, above ion channel current density were not evaluated; and all of them were not addressed in this paper and are worth to more work for this subject.",

As part of electrical remodeling, changes in gap junctions and connexins in AF have been reported. Previous work on connexin expression and function in animal models and humans primarily points towards AF-associated remodeling in which there is a decrease in Cx43 expression but an increase in Cx40 expression [33]. The present study once again confirmed the previous reports, and further demonstrated that ACE2 overexpression reversed connexin remodeling and ultimately reduced AF inducibility. Of note, in the AF-control and Ad-EGFP group, reduced CX43 were mainly found at the cell poles, i.e., at the intercalated discs interconnecting the ends of the myocytes, while increased CX40 were located at the lateral borders, which has been interpreted as the basis of the anisotropy in atrial tissues. Furthermore, these changes would lead to an increase of non-uniform anisotropy and local conduction heterogeneity facilitating reentry in the dilated atria, resulting in the increase of AF inducibility [33]. However, we have not observed any major changes in the ratio of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of CX40 and CX43 in association with the change of CX40 and CX43 expression levels. Further experiments are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms involved in ACE2-induced changes of these two cardiac connexins.",

Therefore, the amelioration of ion channels (Cav1, 2, Kv4.2/Kv4.3, KChiP2), and connexins remodeling by ACE2 overexpression in this study, as well as Ca2+ handling remodeling in previous study, might be related to its inhibition of MAPKs through up-regulation of MKP-1. Conceivably more detailed molecular mechanisms are awaited with great interest. Additionally, for the effects of ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137) axis on cardiac electrical remodeling, a few studies yielded discrepant results [7, 12, 14], with antiarrhythmic or proarrhythmic effects.
