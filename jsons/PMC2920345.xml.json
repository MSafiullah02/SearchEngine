Type I interferons (IFNs) are secreted key cytokines on the innate immune axis that protect uninfected cells and stimulate leukocytes residing at the interface of innate and adaptive immunity, such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) [1].

Relatively simple viruses such as RNA viruses from the Picornaviridae family, as well as DNA viruses with large genomes, such as members from the Poxviridae family, have been shown to inhibit the IFN system. This review covers the latest insights into how virus-encoded antagonists sidetrack the IFN machinery and how this knowledge is currently used to generate second generation live vaccines and antiviral compounds.BOX 1: The IFN circuitThe IFN circuit consists of three distinct steps. The first step consists of recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP), resulting in the synthesis and secretion of IFN-\u03b2 (Figure 2). Subsequently, secreted IFN binds to the IFN-\u03b1 receptor (IFNAR) on the same or surrounding cells, resulting in the transcription of hundreds of IFN-stimulated effector molecules (Figure 3).\n",

Table S1 was compiled from all current literature and includes viral proteins that act as IFN antagonists and whether experimental proof comes from expression studies or infections with mutant viruses lacking the putative IFN antagonists. This latter issue is of great importance since single gene over expression may result in aberrant expression, localization and interactions of viral proteins compared to virus infected cells. Hence, proteins identified by overexpression may not retain the same phenotype in the context of infection. Figure 2, Figure 3 summarize the steps of the IFN system that different viruses interfere with. Although it lays beyond the scope of this review to discuss all antagonists in detail, the ones discussed exemplify the different strategies used by viruses to subvert the IFN response.",

Evolutionary pressure to encode maximum functionality by relatively limited genome capacity drives a high degree of multi-functionality in RNA virus proteins. Genome size restrictions make it such that they cannot derive new large genes encoding IFN antagonists from their hosts as is the case for large dsDNA viruses (e.g. soluble IFN receptor decoys). This considerably restricts the variability of accessory proteins found in RNA viruses and may explain why some related RNA viruses use the same viral protein to antagonize the IFN system, whereas this conservation is limited in large dsDNA viruses (Table S1).

            "text": "Several (+)RNA viruses share common antagonists within their virus family as well. Coronaviruses express the largest known viral RNA genome (>30 000 nt). Their Nsp1 protein is the first protein expressed in infected cells and is an important virulence factor in vivo [29, 30\u2022\u2022]. It degrades cellular mRNA, thereby limiting the expression of antiviral genes [30\u2022\u2022, 31]. Interestingly, SARS-CoV recently transmitted from bats to humans and expresses several accessory proteins that are not expressed by related coronaviruses such as MHV. Two of these accessory gene products (ORF3b and ORF6) have reported IFN antagonistic activity [32, 33]. An ORF6 deletion virus convincingly demonstrated that the ORF6 protein is involved in preventing nuclear translocation of STAT1 by binding to the nuclear transport protein karyopherin \u03b12 and contributes to pathogenicity. In addition to Coronaviridae, three genera within the Flaviviridae family also share common antagonists within their genus. Pestiviruses BVDV and CSFV Npro proteins target IRF-3 for proteasomal degradation [34, 35]. Moreover, their Erns protein was reported to sequester dsRNA [36, 37, 38]. By contrast, all flaviviruses modulate JAK\u2013STAT signaling, albeit by slightly different mechanisms [39, 40, 41, 42, 43]. The hepaciviruses HCV and GBV-B both cleave MAVS with their main protease NS3/4a, thereby rendering it unable to confer the signal from RIG-I to TBK-1/IKK\u025b [44, 45]. Using a similar strategy, enteroviruses commonly cleave MAVS and other innate immune molecules with their main protease 3C [46, 47, 48]. By contrast, non-enteroviruses within the Picornaviridae family express an L protein to target IRF-3 and NF\u03baB [49, 50, 51].",

Moreover, hosts have also been under selection pressure to overcome viral antagonism of IFN, and this is exemplified by examples of positive selection in some of the key components of the IFN system targeted by viruses, such as PKR, which appears to have been rapidly evolving in mammalian hosts to escape from antagonism by K3L, a poxvirus PKR inhibitor [52\u2022\u2022].",

For example, nearly all viruses with (\u2212)ssRNA genomes interfere with sensory molecules, whereas this is much less so for viruses with other genomes (Figure 1). By contrast, (+)ssRNA and dsDNA viruses preferably target IRFs as means to interfere with IFN induction. Finally, (+)ssRNA viruses target the IFN signaling step to a lesser extent than other viruses (Figure 1). Notable exceptions are members of the Flaviviridae. Although these patterns may be explained by selection bias for studied viruses, they may also indicate that different virus families may utilize certain dominant strategies to antagonize the IFN response. These strategies not necessarily provide the broadest possible antagonism (e.g. block of general gene expression), but may be strongly influenced by the type of infection (e.g. acute, chronic, and persistent), vector/host species, and infected cell types.",

Several groups have shown that viruses lacking fully functional IFN antagonists are rapidly cleared in vivo as the result of a potent IFN response, while their replication competent nature ensures the establishment of long-lasting immune memory. Moreover, these viruses can be grown in large quantities in IFN-deficient hosts for potential vaccine stocks. So far, Influenza A/B virus NS1 deletion mutants have been tested in mice and showed that they could protect against challenge with wild-type virus [62, 63, 64, 65\u2022]. Also, recent evidence from studies with SARS-CoV nsp-1, JEV E, and RSV NS2 mutant viruses suggests that these viruses likewise represent good vaccine candidates [29, 65\u2022, 66\u2022]. The generation of attenuated viruses is aimed at achieving an optimal balance between minimal clinical symptoms and maximum replication in the nasal mucosa. Mucosal immunity is especially effective against respiratory viruses such as influenza viruses, RSV, and coronaviruses [67].",
