            "text": "The concept of microarray technology was first put forward by Ekins (1989)over 20 years ago. An ambient analyte theory was proposed that a tiny spot of a purified antibody or protein provides substantially better sensitivity than when used in conventional immunoassay formats as miniaturized features can dramatically enhance detection sensitivity. Though not exactly the same, DNA microarray technology became the first application of this theory and has been tremendously successful in gene expression profiling and other derivatized applications, such as ChIP-chip (DeRisi et al., 1997, Morley et al., 2004, Pease et al., 1994, Schadt et al., 2003, Schena et al., 1995). However, RNA expression levels do not always correlate with protein expression levels, and biological functions are carried out primarily by proteins rather than nucleic acids (Gygi et al., 1999, Lueking et al., 2005b). Therefore, it was the next logical step to develop a miniaturized protein-centered device, namely protein microarrays, for studies of protein functionalities in a high-throughput and highly flexible fashion.",

            "text": "A protein microarray, also known as a protein chip, is formed by immobilization of thousands of different proteins (e.g., antigens, antibodies, enzymes, substrates, etc.) in discrete spatial locations at a high-density solid surface (typically glass) (Smith et al., 2005, Tao et al., 2007). On the basis of their applications, protein microarrays can be classified into two types: analytical and functional protein microarrays (Fig. 4.1\n). Analytical protein microarrays are usually composed of well-characterized biomolecules with specific binding activities, such as antibodies, to analyze the components of complex biological samples (e.g., serum and cell lysates) or to determine whether a sample contains a specific protein of interest. They have been used for protein expression profiling, biomarker identification, cell surface marker/glycosylation profiling, clinical diagnosis, and environmental/food safety analysis (Kumble, 2003). On the other hand, functional protein microarrays are constructed by printing a large number of individually purified proteins and are mainly used to comprehensively query biochemistry properties and activities of those immobilized proteins. In principle, it is feasible to print arrays composed of virtually all annotated proteins of a given organism, effectively comprising a whole-proteome microarray. Functional protein microarrays have been successfully applied to identify protein\u2013protein, protein\u2013lipid, protein\u2013antibody, protein\u2013small molecules, protein\u2013DNA, protein\u2013RNA, lectin\u2013glycan, and lectin\u2013cell interactions, and to identify substrates or enzymes in phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, acetylation, and nitrosylation, as well as to profile immune response. In this chapter, we will mainly focus on the fabrication and application of functional protein microarrays in basic and clinical research.",

            "text": "An early attempt led by the Lehrach group was to express human proteins in Escherichia coli using a library consisting of random cDNAs (Bussow et al., 1998). Individual cDNA clones of this library were robotically arrayed onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane laid on top of agar media and allowed to grow to full size. These cells were then lysed in situ to extract proteins. The usefulness of such an array was first demonstrated by incubation with a labeled test protein to identify interacting partners (Bussow et al., 1998). Strictly speaking, besides the fact that only one-sixth of the cDNAs are in the proper reading frames, those correctly expressed human proteins bound to the nitrocellulose membranes were not purified\u2014the majority of the proteins in every spot were bacterial proteins. Furthermore, the proteins were neither unique nor in their native conformation, given the redundancy of the library and denaturing conditions used to break the bacteria open. Though powerful as a screening technique in early days, this particular experimental strategy had limited general applications (Holt et al., 2000, Lueking et al., 1999).",

            "text": "To overcome these hurdles, Zhu et al. (2001) in the Snyder group created a high-throughput protein purification protocol in the budding yeast (Fig. 4.2\n). Using a homologous recombination-based strategy, more than 5800 full-length yeast open reading frames (ORFs) were cloned into a yeast expression vector that, upon galactose induction, produces glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged N-terminal fusion proteins. The purification protocol took advantage of both a 96-well format and immobilized affinity chromatography. This strategy allowed parallel purification of unprecedented numbers of proteins\u2014up to 1152 per day. The success of this approach is built upon several unique aspects. First, it utilizes a eukaryotic expression system that both generates high levels of recombinant proteins and tends to produce a high fraction of soluble proteins. Compared with bacterial expression systems, in which a large fraction of recombinant proteins end up in inclusion bodies, this is a huge advantage when a large number of eukaryotic proteins are being generated. Second, the expression of recombinant proteins is only induced over about two total cell cycles, which greatly reduces toxicity and cell death. Third, a foreign eukaryotic protein purified from yeast is more likely to be active because posttranslational modifications necessary for function are more likely to occur correctly than in either bacteria or a cell-free system. Forth, the use of an N-terminal GST tag helps protein fold correctly and therefore improve its stability and solubility. Other commonly used tags include the so-called TAP tag, MPB, and Hisx6, to name a few. In fact, the same group later went on to build a TAP-tagged yeast ORF collection and purified >5,000 yeast proteins (Gelperin et al., 2005).",

The procedures for automatic high-throughput protein expression/purification using the 6xHis tag have been developed by the Zhu group (Chen et al., 2008). Once the bacterial culture is prepared, all 4000 proteins can be purified within a single day. The subsequent protein purification takes advantage of immobilized Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Hochuli et al., 1987). The 6xHis tag usually does not alter the properties of the fusion proteins, and the increment of molecular weight is less than 1 kDa. Furthermore, it is selective and stable even under severe denaturing conditions (Joshi et al., 2000, Mukhija et al., 1995).",

            "text": "Despite the fact that high-throughput protein production in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes is now increasingly feasible, these protocols are labor intensive and costly. Aside from the cost of protein production, fabrication of a proteome microarray requires construction of an expressible collection of full-length ORFs, which can be both challenging and expensive when dealing with higher eukaryotes with a large number of genes, such as humans. To explore alternative approaches, several groups have attempted to test the in vitro transcription/translation systems, such as the E. coli, wheat germ, and rabbit reticulocyte systems. In these systems, proteins can be expressed directly from cDNA templates (Allen and Miller, 1999), which can be obtained through polymerase chain reaction amplification without the lengthy and costly process of subcloning. For example, the E. coli cell-free protein expression system has been used to synthesize proteins in a 96-well format (Murthy et al., 2004), and the improved wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis system has been applied to the in vitro expression of 13,364 human proteins (Goshima et al., 2008). More recently, the Felgner group has published a series of articles describing fabrication of protein microarrays in a variety of bacteria by directly spotting in vitro translated protein mixtures to glass (Crompton et al., 2010, Liang et al., 2011). However, although these systems can significantly decrease the reaction volume required for generation of recombinant proteins (Angenendt et al., 2004), the impurity of the translated proteins limits their applications.",

Similarly, in the Nucleic Acid Programmable Protein Array (NAPPA) technology, biotinylated cDNA plasmids encoding proteins as GST fusions are printed onto avidin-coated slides, together with anti-GST antibodies as the capture molecules (Ramachandran et al., 2004). The cDNA array is then incubated with rabbit reticulocyte lysate to express the proteins, which become trapped by the antibodies adjacent to each DNA spot. Recently, NAPPA has been successfully expanded to high-density arrays of 1000 different proteins (Ramachandran et al., 2008). In addition, Tao and Zhu (2006) developed a different method in which ribosomes are installed at the end of an RNA template to allow for the capture of the nascent polypeptides by a puromycin moiety that is grafted at one end of an oligonucleotide immobilized on a solid surface.",

For example, 6xHis-tags have been utilized to immobilize proteins on nickel-NTA-coated glass slides (Zhu et al., 2001). Presumably, affinity-based protein immobilization should result in immobilization of proteins in relatively uniform orientation with minimum interruption of protein structure and thus, may be the best approach to for preserving the structure and function of printed proteins.

It is not amenable to real-time label-free detection, which can provide important information when analyzing reaction dynamics. Therefore, label-free detection methods have also been investigated for protein microarrays. Optical techniques of various types are emerging as an important tool for mentoring the dynamics of biomolecule interactions on a solid surface. For instance, Imaging Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy (SPR) (Nelson et al., 1999, Thiel et al., 1997), Imaging Optical Ellipsometry (OE) (Wang and Jin, 2003), and Reflectometric Interference Spectroscopy (Piehler et al., 1997) are three label-free optical techniques that in essence measure the same optical dielectric response of a thin film and therefore detect changes of physical or chemical properties of the thin film, such as thickness and mass density during biochemical reactions.",

This is an extremely sensitive detection method: it has a time resolution of 20 \u03bcs, a space resolution (i.e., thickness) of 0.4 nm, and a detection limit of 14 fg of protein per spot.

First, a p-polarized He-Ne laser beam (\u03bb = 632.8 nM) passes through a photoelastic modulator to induce oscillation between p- and s-polarization at a frequency of 50 kHz. Second, after passing through a phase shifter, the resultant beam is incident on the microarray surface at an oblique angle theta (\u03b8\ninc). Finally, the first I(\u03a9) and second harmonics I(2\u03a9) of the reflected beam intensity are simultaneously monitored by two digital lock-in amplifiers (Lu et al., 2010). The difference caused by changes in reflectivity between the s- and p-polarized light, namely the OIRD signal, is \u0394p \u2212 \u0394s, composed of both real and imaginary components. Because the imaginary component, which is proportional to the first I(\u03a9), is more sensitive, the OIRD signal is determined as \u201cIm{\u0394p \u2212 \u0394s}\u201d (Formula I), which is dependent on the incident angle (\u03b8\ninc) and the dielectric constants of the ambient, protein, and substrate of the microarray (i.e., glass) (Wen et al., 2010).",

            "text": "During the development of various assay types, it became obvious that surface chemistry plays an important role in the success of a new assay (Table 4.1\n). For example, protein\u2013DNA interactions were first performed on the yeast proteome microarrays on a nitrocellulose surface (i.e., FAST slide) with randomly shared yeast genomic DNA fragments that were labeled with Cy5 (Hall et al., 2004). Later, Hu et al. (2009) also found that the FAST slide, among other tested surfaces, produced the best signal-to-noise ratio for DNA-binding assays. In another example, when our group was developing protein acetylation reactions using 14C-labeled Ac-CoA as a donor, we first tested the NuA4 acetylation reaction using histone H3 and H4 as substrates on FAST slides, as well as aldehyde- and Ni-NTA-coated slides (Lin et al., 2009, Lu et al., 2011). The results were clear that both FAST and nickel surfaces worked, but FAST surface produced better signal-to-noise ratios (Fig. 4.4\n). However, FAST surface was not suitable for phosphorylation reactions because the background noises were too high (Ptacek et al., 2005, Zhu et al., 2009). Another interest case is to develop an assay for profiling cell surface glycans on a lectin microarray. We and others found that so far the only proper surface for this type of binding assays is a commercial Schott slide, although the exact surface chemistry is not revealed (Hsu et al., 2006, Pilobello et al., 2007, Tao et al., 2008). Several reasons may be accounted for the importance of surface chemistry. First, for low-affinity binding assays (e.g., protein\u2013DNA interactions), a porous surface (e.g., FAST) is likely to retain more proteins and hence improving sensitivity. Second, when radioisotope-labeled small molecules are used, it is important to completely remove unincorporated radioisotopes from the surface to reduce background noise. This might explain why phosphorylation does not work well on FAST surface. Third, in the case of using live cells to probe a lectin microarray, the grafted chemical ligands must not be too repulsive to cells. Other factors, such as protein conformation and stability, can also be affected by surface chemistry. Therefore, whenever a novel assay is to be developed, a variety of surfaces should be tested first in a pilot study.",

For example, Zhu et al. (2001) developed the first proteome microarray composed of approximately 5,800 recombinant yeast proteins (>85% of the yeast proteome) and identified binding partners of calmodulin and phosphatidylinositides (PIPs). They first incubated the microarrays with biotinylated bovine calmodulin and discovered 39 new calmodulin binding partners. In addition, using liposomes as a carrier for various PIPs, they identified more than 150 binding proteins, more than 50% of which were known membrane-associated proteins. Popescu et al. (2007) developed a protein microarray containing 1,133 Arabidopsis thaliana proteins and also used it to globally identify proteins bind to calmodulins or calmodulin-like proteins in Arabidopsis. A large number of previously known and novel targets were identified, including transcription factors (TFs), receptor and intracellular protein kinases, F-box proteins, RNA-binding proteins, and proteins of unknown function. Alternative approaches to identifying protein\u2013protein interactions, such as the yeast two-hybrid system and protein complex purification coupled with mass spectrometry analysis, are well-established, however, and are used as standard high-throughput methods to detect protein\u2013protein interactions in higher eukaryotes (Krogan et al., 2006, Vidal et al., 1996). Thus, while protein microarray-based approaches provide a rapid approach to characterizing protein\u2013protein interactions, they have much competition in this arena.",

The protein microarrays were probed with 400 predicted and 60 known DNA motifs, and a total of 17,718 PDIs were identified. Many known PDIs and a large number of new PDIs for both well-characterized and predicted TFs were recovered, and new consensus sites for over 200 TFs were determined, which doubled the number of previously reported consensus sites for human TFs (Hu et al., 2009, Xie et al., 2010). Surprisingly, over 300 proteins that were previously unknown to specifically interact with DNA showed sequence-specific PDIs, suggesting that many human proteins may bind specific DNA sequences as a moonlighting function. To further investigate whether the DNA-binding activities of these unconventional DNA binding proteins (uDBPs) were physiologically relevant, we carried out in-depth analysis on a well-studied protein kinase, Erk2, to determine the potential mechanism behind its DNA-binding activity. Using a series of in vitro and in vivo approaches, such as electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), luciferase assay, mutagenesis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we demonstrated that the DNA-binding activity of Erk2 is independent of its protein kinase activity and it acts as a transcription repressor of transcripts induced by interferon gamma signaling (Hu et al., 2009). Other than Erk2, many other uDBPs show sequence-specific DNA-binding activity, and more intriguingly, many of their consensus sequences are highly similar to those recognized by annotated TFs (Fig. 4.5\n). This observation suggests that these uDBPs may synergistically work with the TFs to achieve highly accurate transcription regulation.",

For example, the core enzyme, Esa1, of the essential nucleosome acetyltransferase of H4 (NuA4) complex, is the only essential HAT in yeast, which strongly suggested that it may target additional nonhistone proteins that are crucial for cell to survive. To identify nonhistone substrates of the NuA4 complex, Lin et al.

Surprisingly, 91 proteins were found to be readily acetylated by the NuA4 complex on the array (examples are shown in Fig. 4.4). To further validate these in vitro results, 20 of them were randomly chosen and 13 of them showed Esa1-dependent acetylation in cells. One of them, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1p), was further characterized to explore the possible link between acetylation and metabolism. Mass spectrometry assay revealed Lys19 and 514 as the acetylation sites of Pck1p, and mutagenesis analyses demonstrated that acetylation on K514 is critical to enhance Pck1p\u2019s enzyme activity and results in longer life span for yeast cells growing under starvation.

We used mutants at four acetylation sites, K12, 16, 17, and 256, to study acetyl-Sip2 function. Sip2 acetylation, controlled by antagonizing NuA4 acetyltransferase and Rpd3 deacetylase, enhances interaction with kinase Snf1, the catalytic \u03b1 subunit of Snf1 complex. Sip2\u2013Snf1 interaction inhibits Snf1 activity, thus decreasing the phosphorylation of a downstream target, Sch9, and ultimately leading to impaired growth but extends yeast replicative life span. We also demonstrate that the antiaging effect of Sip2 acetylation is independent of nutrient availability and TORC1 activity. Therefore, intrinsic aging stress, signaled via the Sip2\u2013Snf1 acetylation, constitutes a second TORC1-independent pathway regulating Sch9 activity that controls life span in yeast.",

However, correlating this information with a fundamental underling mechanism is often challenging. Our group in collaboration with the Hayward group hypothesized that conserved proteins from related viruses would tend to target the same host pathways using similar mechanisms (Li et al., in press). Herpesviruses all encode conserved serine/threonine kinases that play an important role in virus replication and spread. We utilized a human protein microarray to identify shared host targets of the conserved kinases encoded by four human herpesviruses and discovered that the DNA damage pathway was statistically enriched for shared substrates. Using the gamma herpesvirus Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), we demonstrated that the EBV kinase activates an upstream mediator of the DNA damage response, the histone acetyltransferase TIP60. EBV also utilizes the chromatin remodeling function of TIP60 in a positive feedback loop to enhance expression of EBV genes needed for virus replication. Identification of key cellular targets of the conserved herpesvirus kinases will facilitate the development of broadly effective antiviral strategies.

            "text": "Recent years have witnessed a rapid growth in using functional protein microarrays for basic research (Tao et al., 2007). Although the technology is still at a relatively early stage of development, it has become obvious that the protein microarray platform can and will act as a versatile tool suitable for the large-scale high-throughput biology, especially in the areas of profiling PTMs and in analysis of signal transduction networks and pathways (Hu et al., 2009, Ptacek et al., 2005). As another crucial proteomics technology, recent progress in mass spectrometry has allowed global profiling of PTMs using a shotgun approach. For example, the Zhao, Mann, and Guan groups recently identified numerous acetylated lysine residues in metabolic enzymes in mice and human cells without knowing the upstream HATs (Choudhary et al., 2009, Kim et al., 2006, Zhao et al., 2010). In parallel, our team also identified many yeast metabolic enzymes as substrates of the NuA4 acetylation complex without knowing the actual modified sites (Lin et al., 2009, Lu et al., 2011). Therefore, we envision that the combination of the two technologies will have enormous potential to both identify critical regulatory PTMs at the resolution of modified individual amino acids and to identify the enzymes that mediate these effects. Another emerging direction is in the forefront of understanding the molecular mechanisms of pathogen\u2013host interactions. In the same manner in which we identified host proteins that recognized the SLD loop of the BMV virus, functional protein microarrays (e.g., a human protein microarray) can be used to discover those host proteins targeted by pathogens (e.g., HIV, HCV, and SARS-CoV). The identification of the host targets of a virus will provide alternative therapeutics that cannot be rapidly evaded via mutation of the viral genomes (Brass et al., 2009). In conclusion, the potential of functional protein microarrays is only just now starting to reveal itself. It is expected that it will become an indispensable and invaluable tool in proteomics and systems biology research.",
