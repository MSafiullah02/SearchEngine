            "text": "BCoV is enveloped and pleomorphic, ranging from 65 to 210 nm in diameter, and covered with a double layer of short (hemagglutinin) and long (spike) surface projections (Fig. 1\n).2 Like other enveloped viruses, BCoV is sensitive to detergents and lipid solvents (eg, ether, chloroform) and is inactivated by conventional disinfectants, formalin, and heat. The large genome consists of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of 27 to 32 kb encoding 5 major structural proteins. Among these, the 50-kDa nucleocapsid (N) is highly conserved among strains, so it is often the target for viral RNA detection assays.29 Unique to some group 2 CoVs including BCoV and wild ruminant CoVs, is the presence of a surface hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) glycoprotein (120\u2013140 kDa). The HE acts as a receptor-destroying enzyme (esterase) to reverse hemagglutination. Like other CoVs, BCoV also possesses an outer-surface S glycoprotein (190 kDa). It consists of an S1 subunit that contains the dominant neutralizing epitopes and an S2 subunit that mediates viral membrane fusion. HE and S are important viral proteins that are involved in attachment to host cell receptors and hemagglutination of chicken, rat, mouse, and hamster erythrocytes. MAbs to the HE or S protein prevented BCoV-induced villous atrophy in vivo in intestinal loops of calves, confirming their dual role in in vivo protection.31 HE and S proteins elicit neutralizing antibodies that can block viral attachment and infectivity, so they are important for immunity and vaccines.",

            "text": "Variation in tissue tropism and host range among CoVs is attributed mainly to changes in the S protein. Researchers have sequenced the partial or full-length S gene of multiple BCoV strains to ascertain the genetic basis of the broad host range of BCoV (see section on Epidemiology) and occurrence of the distinct clinical syndromes. Several groups have compared the S (or S1) or full-length genomic sequences22, 26, 27, 28, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 of WD or respiratory and enteric BCoV isolates, including isolates from the same animal. The porcine respiratory CoV evolved as an S gene deletion mutant (deletions of 621\u2013681nuceotides) of swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, acquiring an almost exclusive respiratory tropism.37 No similar large S gene deletions were detected in respiratory BCoV strains, most of which also possess an enteric tropism as revealed by calf challenge studies.29 Focusing on the hypervariable region (amino acids [aa] 452\u2013593) containing the neutralizing epitope (S1B) of the S1 subunit, 4 groups22, 26, 27, 36 reported that respiratory strains (or respiratory and enteric isolates from the same feedlot calf) had changes in aa residues 510 and 531 compared with the reference enteric Mebus strain and a WD strain (DBA). One of the polymorphic positions (aa 531) discriminated between enteric (aspartic acid or asparagine) and respiratory (glycine) BCoV strains in 2 studies,26, 36 but not in others.27, 28, 34 Therefore, like the antigenic and biologic differences observed among BCoV isolates, variability was not necessarily related to the clinical origin of the isolates.14, 15 BCoV, like other RNA viruses, represents a quasispecies or swarm of viruses;38 some viruses within a population may be more suitable for replication in respiratory versus intestinal sites, contributing to the sequence differences reported for paired enteric/respiratory isolates from the same host.28 Zhang and colleagues28 noted that in the process of cell culture adaptation, an enteric BCoV strain accumulated mutations to resemble the corresponding respiratory BCoV isolate from the same animal. Consequently interpretation of the comparative sequence analysis of enteric and respiratory strains of BCoV may be compromised by lack of complete genome sequences and the laboratory manipulation of field strains (multiple cell culture passage and plaque isolations) before sequencing.",

            "text": "All investigators showed that the greatest aa sequence divergence (42 aa changes at 38 distinct sites)27 and the most differences by phylogenetic analysis were between the historic reference Mebus enteric BCoV strain (1972) and the more recent BCoV isolates, regardless of their clinical origin. This result demonstrates that BCoVs, like other RNA viruses, are evolving in the field, with recent isolates more similar to contemporary strains than to historic strains. If the genetic divergence affects neutralizing or other key epitopes allowing viruses to escape existing immunity,36 then vaccines containing more contemporary or broadly cross-reactive BCoV strains may be required to enhance the efficacy of existing or newly developed BCoV vaccines. Sequential sera from cattle with respiratory BCoV infections associated with BRDC pneumonia reacted with higher neutralizing and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers to a more contemporary respiratory lung isolate (97TXSF-Lu15-2) than to much older historic enteric BCoV strains, including a derivative of the high cell culture\u2013passaged Mebus 1972 strain (L9-81) and an older wild type strain (LY138-3).39 However, in a previous report from the same laboratory,35 an earlier isolate of a respiratory BCoV strain (BRCV-G95) was more similar to the enteric LY-138 strain than to the older Mebus strain L9-81 based on S-specific MAb reactivity. These data concur with the greater phylogenetic and antigenic divergence described between the Mebus cell culture\u2013passaged strain compared with the more recent enteric and respiratory BCoV isolates.14, 15, 28, 40 In the studies by Lin and colleagues,39 it is likely that the antigenic variation observed reflects the timeframe differences, independently of the enteric versus respiratory origin of the isolates. Repeating these immunologic assays using more recent enteric BCoV strains is necessary to clarify this issue.",

In 1 of these 2 herds, clinical signs were present in calves, heifers, and lactating dairy cattle. In the second, concurrent infection with a group A bovine rotavirus was detected. Researchers also detected ocular shedding of BCoV in lower titers in one of the herds, suggesting that ocular swabs could be another diagnostic specimen for detection of BCoV. BCoV was isolated in human rectal tumor (HRT)-18 cells from nasal swabs of calves from 3 of the 4 outbreaks.",

Subsequently, repeated or intermittent nasal shedding episodes occurred in the same animal, with or without respiratory disease, but with transient increases in serum antibody titers consistent with reinfection. These findings suggest a lack of long-term mucosal immunity in the upper respiratory tract after natural respiratory BCoV infection, confirming similar observations for human46 and porcine respiratory CoV infections.47\n",

Wild ruminant CoV isolates from sambar and white-tailed deer and waterbuck also infected the upper respiratory and intestinal tracts of gnotobiotic calves and caused diarrhea,54 affirming experimentally that wild ruminants may serve as a reservoir for CoV strains that are transmissible to calves. The possibility exists that native wild ruminants may transmit bovine-like CoVs to cattle (see later) or vice versa. Few serologic surveys of wild ruminants in native habitats have been done. A particular concern is that such interspecies infections may culminate in more genetically divergent BCoV strains including recombinant strains, increasing the possibility of their transmission to other species. Analysis of CoV genomic sequence data has revealed that porcine HEV and human respiratory CoV OC43 represent CoVs that likely evolved from ancestral BCoV strains.58\n",

A human enteric CoV isolate from a child with acute diarrhea (HECoV-4408) was genetically (99% nucleotide identity in the S and HE gene with BCoV) and antigenically closely related to BCoV, suggesting that it is a BCoV variant able to infect humans. A recent report confirmed that the HECoV-4408 strain infects (upper respiratory tract and intestine) and causes diarrhea and intestinal lesions in gnotobiotic calves. This strain induced complete cross-protective immunity against the virulent BCoV-DB2 enteric strain. An enteric BCoV also experimentally infected dogs, causing subclinical infection and seroconversion.62 Furthermore, the virulent BCoV-DB2 enteric strain caused mild disease (diarrhea) in phylogenetically diverse species such as avian hosts, including baby turkeys but not baby chicks.63 These data raise intriguing questions of whether dogs or wild birds (such as wild turkeys) can also be a reservoir for bovine-like CoVs transmissible to cattle or wild ruminants, or conversely, if cattle (or ruminants) can transmit CoVs to dogs, wild birds, or poultry. There are few if any seroprevalence surveys for bovine-like CoVs in avian species and only limited data for wild ruminants.54, 57 The reasons for the broad host range of BCoV are unknown but may relate to the presence of a hemagglutinin on BCoV and its possible role in binding to diverse cell types. Experimental evidence for interspecies transmission of bovine-like CoVs between wild ruminants, dogs, birds, and cattle is of concern for open feedlots where wild birds may congregate or cattle may be exposed to dogs, wild ruminants, or their feces.",

Advantages include rapid test results and applicability to large sample numbers. Highly sensitive molecular assays to detect BCoV RNA in nasal secretions, lung lysates, or feces are becoming more widely used. These assays include RT-PCR and the more sensitive nested RT-PCR and real-time qPCR assays.29, 67 Ideally these assays should target conserved regions of the BCoV genome (polymerase or N protein) to detect divergent strains.

            "text": "The BRDC of feedlot calves is characterized by fever, dyspnea, inflammatory and necrotizing lung lesions leading to bronchopneumonia, weight loss, and death. It is most pronounced during the first weeks after arrival at feedlots and overlaps with a high prevalence of respiratory viral and secondary bacterial coinfections and various environmental or host stress factors during this period. A growing number of reports in the past decade have provided epidemiologic or experimental evidence suggesting that BCoV respiratory infection contributes substantially to the BRDC. Multiple previous studies (see section on Epidemiology) have documented nasal and fecal shedding of BCoV by calves shortly after arrival in feedlots and subsequent seroconversion to BCoV (see Table 1). Storz and colleagues19 showed a progression in development of the BRDC for natural cases, initiated by BCoV respiratory infection (nasal shedding) upon arrival followed by dual infections with BCoV and respiratory bacteria (Mannheimia hemolytica and Pasteurella multocida). This progression led to pneumonia and deaths in 26 cases, most of which had concurrent high titers of BCoV and bacteria in the lungs. The cattle died within 5 to 36 days after the disease onset. Clinical signs included high fever and severe respiratory distress. Gross lung lesions consisted of subacute exudative and necrotizing lobar pneumonia involving 50%\u201380% of the lung volume. Histologic lung lesions were characterized as fibrinous, necrotizing lobar pneumonia, but with moderate to severe bronchitis and bronchiolitis. The investigators concluded that these data supported a role for BCoV in the BRDC as defined by Evans' criteria for causation. In this and another study,20 researchers confirmed the presence of BCoV antigen in respiratory epithelial cells or isolated BCoV from nasal secretions, trachea, bronchi, or lung alveoli and documented the presence of interstitial emphysema, bronchiolitis and alveolitis in concert with bacterial infection (see Table 1). Although BRDC is recognized as a multifactorial disease, this evidence supports a role for BCoV in inciting the disease. Multifactorial/multiagent experiments describing interactions between respiratory viruses, bacteria, and stress have highlighted their synergistic effects in the BRDC70 but no such experiments have been reported for BCoV. Such studies of feedlot age, BCoV-seronegative stressed calves are needed to further elucidate the role of BCoV in the BRDC and the mechanisms involved in predisposing calves to development of fatal pneumonia.",

The shipping of cattle long distances to feedlots and the comingling of cattle from multiple farms creates physical stresses that overwhelm the animal's defense mechanisms and provide close contact for exposure to high concentrations of new pathogens or strains not previously encountered. For the BRDC, various predisposing factors (viruses, stress) allow commensal bacteria of the nasal cavity (eg, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella sp, Mycoplasma sp) to infect the lungs leading to a fatal fibrinous pneumonia.17, 19, 20, 21\n",

The data further suggest that IN administration of a BCoV CD strain induces cross-protection against field exposure to a respiratory BCoV. The findings concur with results of experimental challenge studies of calves confirming cross-protection among BCoV strains of distinct clinical origin. Inoculation of gnotobiotic or colostrum-deprived calves with CD, WD, or respiratory BCoV strains led to nasal and fecal CoV shedding followed by complete cross-protection against diarrhea after challenge with a calf diarrhea strain.29, 30 Subclinical nasal and fecal virus shedding (detected only by RT-PCR) in calves challenged with the heterologous BCoV strains29, 30 confirmed field studies documenting subclinical BCoV infections and the potential for subclinically infected animals to be a reservoir for BCoV in infected herds.16, 24 Consequently, the goal is to develop vaccines that are protective against divergent field strains of BCoV, including ones from the distinct clinical syndromes. Inclusion of a mixture of strains representing CD, WD, and respiratory isolates may be an ideal strategy to develop a single broad-spectrum BCoV vaccine effective against BCoV infections associated with each of the clinical syndromes including respiratory disease.",

Detection of similar CoV strains among wild ruminants and in dogs, with evidence for experimental interspecies transmission to calves, suggests that these species could harbor CoVs transmissible to cattle or vice versa.\u2022BCoV is associated with 3 clinically distinct syndromes in cattle: CD, WD in adults, and respiratory disease in cattle of various ages.\u2022Greater biologic, antigenic, and genetic diversity is evident between contemporary and historic BCoV strains than between enteric and respiratory strains. There are no consistent markers to discriminate between respiratory and enteric BCoVs.\u2022Existence of a single serotype of BCoV and cross-protection among strains from the different clinical syndromes suggests that a single broadly cross-reactive strain of BCoV may suffice for a vaccine. Alternatively, because of variations among field strains, including ones from the 3 clinical syndromes, a single vaccine composed of CD, WD, and respiratory BCoV isolates may provide a broader spectrum of protection against all 3 syndromes.\u2022An accumulating body of evidence suggests that BCoV respiratory infections contribute substantially to the BRDC of feedlot cattle.\u2022Underlying disease or respiratory coinfections, dose and route of infection (fecal/oral or aerosols), and immunosuppression (corticosteroids) related to shipping or immunosuppressive viral coinfections are potential cofactors that could exacerbate the severity of BCoV infections and the BRDC.\u2022Samples for antemortem diagnosis of BCoV infections include nasal swabs, tracheobronchial aspirates, and feces collected in the acute stage of infection; postmortem tissues include ones from the upper respiratory tract, lung, ileum, and colon. Highly sensitive molecular assays (RT-PCR, nested RT-PCR, qRT-PCR) are being used increasingly to detect BCoV RNA in diagnostic samples including tissue homogenates (lung, and so forth).\u2022Because most cattle are seropositive to BCoV, in suspect herd outbreaks, collection and testing of paired sera for BCoV antibody tests is essential for diagnosis.\u2022There are no BCoV vaccines to prevent respiratory BCoV infections in cattle, and the correlates of immunity to respiratory BCoV infections are unknown.\u2022In multiple studies, the serum BCoV antibody isotype (IgG1, IgG2, IgA), neutralizing and HI antibody titer, and magnitude of antibody titer in serum of cattle on arrival in feedlots were correlated with various parameters of protection against the BRDC. Whether the serum antibodies are correlates of protection or only reflect previous BCoV exposure is uncertain.\u2022Because BCoV infections commonly occur at or shortly after arrival of cattle to feedlots or at auction barns, use of BCoV vaccines in preconditioning calf programs before shipment of calves would be the most beneficial.\n",
