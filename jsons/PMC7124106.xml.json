            "text": "Understanding disease spreading and evolution involves overcoming a multitude of complex, multi-scale challenges of mathematical and biological nature [1, 2]. Traditionally, the contact process between an infected individual and the susceptible ones was assumed to affect equally any susceptible in a population (mean-field approximation, well-mixed population approximation) or, alternatively, all those susceptible living in the physical neighborhood of the infected individual (spatial transmission). During recent years, however, it has become clear that disease spreading [2\u20135] transcends geography: the contact process is no longer restricted to the immediate geographical neighbors, but exhibits the stereotypical small-world phenomenon [6\u20139], as testified by recent global pandemics (together with the impressive amount of research that has been carried out to investigate them) or, equally revealing, the dynamics associated with the spreading of computer viruses [5, 10\u201323]. Recent advances in the science of networks [3, 4, 19, 24, 25] also provided compelling evidence of the role that the networks of contacts between individuals or computers play in the dynamics of infectious diseases [4, 7]. In the majority of cases in which complex networks of disease spreading have been considered [9], they were taken to be a single, static entity. However, contact networks are intrinsically temporal entities and, in general, one expects the contact process to proceed along the lines of several networks simultaneously [11, 13\u201316, 18, 23, 24, 26\u201336]. In fact, modern societies have developed rapid means of information dissemination, both at local and at centralized levels, which one naturally expects to alter individuals\u2019 response to vaccination policies, their behavior with respect to other individuals and their perception of likelihood and risk of infection [37]. In some cases one may even witness the adoption of centralized measures, such as travel restrictions [38, 39] or the imposition of quarantine spanning parts of the population [40], which may induce abrupt dynamical features onto the structure of the contact networks. In other cases, social media can play a determinant role in defining the contact network, providing crucial information on the dynamical patterns of disease spreading [41]. Furthermore, the knowledge an individual has (based on local and/or social media information) about the health status of acquaintances, partners, relatives, etc., combined with individual preventive strategies [42\u201350] (such as condoms, vaccination, the use of face masks or prophylactic drugs, avoidance of visiting specific web-pages, staying away from public places, etc.), also leads to changes in the structure and shape of the contact networks that naturally acquire a temporal dimension that one should not overlook.",

Does one expect that it will lead to a rigid shift of the critical parameters driving disease evolution, as one witnesses whenever one includes spatial transmission patterns? Or even to an evanescence of their values whenever one models the contact network as a (static and infinite) scale-free network, such that the variance of the network degree distribution becomes arbitrarily large? Or will the temporal nature of the contact network lead to new dynamical features? And, if so, which features will emerge from the inclusion of this temporal dimension?",

            "text": "To answer this question computationally constitutes, in general, a formidable challenge. We shall attempt to address the problem analytically, and to this end some simplifications will be required. However, the simplifications we shall introduce become plausible taking into consideration recent results (i) in the evolutionary dynamics of social dilemmas of cooperation, (ii) in the dynamics of peer-influence, and even (iii) in the investigation of how individual behavior determines and is determined by the global, population wide behavior. All these recent studies point out to the fact that the impact of temporal networks in the population dynamics stems mostly from the temporal part itself, and not so much from the detailed shape and structure of the network [56\u201363]. Indeed, we now know that (i) different models of adaptive network dynamics lead to similar qualitative features regarding their impact in what concerns the evolution of cooperation [56\u201363], (ii) the degree of peer-influence is robust to the structural patterns associated with the underlying social networks [62], and (iii) the impact of temporal networks in connecting individual to collective behavior in the evolution of cooperation is very robust and related to a problem of N-body coordination [61, 63]. Altogether, these features justify that we model the temporal nature of the contact network in terms of a simple, adaptive network, the dynamics of which can be approximately described in terms a coupled system of ODEs. This \u201cadaptive-linking\u201d dynamics, as it was coined [28, 57\u201359], leads to network snapshot structures that do not replicate what one observes in real-life, in the same sense that the small-world model of Watts and Strogatz does not lead to the heterogeneous and diverse patterns observed in data snapshots of social networks. Notwithstanding, the active-linking dynamics allows us to include, analytically, the temporal dimension into the problem of disease dynamics. The results [28], as we elaborate in Sects. 3 and 4, prove rewarding, showing that the temporal dimension of a contact network leads to a shift of the critical parameters (defined below) which is no longer rigid but, instead, becomes dependent on the frequency of infected individuals in the population. This, we believe, constitutes a very strong message with a profound impact whenever one tries to incorporate the temporal dimension into computational models of disease forecast.",

In the extreme limit of perfect information and individual capacity to immediately break up contacts with infected, we are isolating all infected, and as such containing disease progression.

All individual-based simulations start from a complete network of size N=100. Disease spreading and network evolution proceed together under asynchronous updating. Disease update events take place with probability (1 + \u03c4)\u22121, where \u03c4 = \u03c4\nNET/\u03c4\nDIS. We define \u03c4\nDIS as the time-scale of disease progression, whereas \u03c4\nNET is the time scale of network change. The parameter \u03c4 = \u03c4\nNET/\u03c4\nDIS provides the relative time scale in terms of which we may interpolate between the limits when network adaptation is much slower than disease progression (\u03c4 \u2192 0) and the opposite limit when network adaptation is much faster than disease progression (\u03c4 \u2192 \u221e). Since \u03c4 = \u03c4\nNET/\u03c4\nDISis the only relevant parameter, we can make, without loss of generality, \u03c4\nDIS = 1. For network update events, we randomly draw two nodes from the population. If connected, then the link disappears with probability given by the respective b\npq. Otherwise, a new link appears with probability c. When a disease update event occurs, a recovery event takes place with probability (1 + \u3008k\u3009)\u22121, an infection event otherwise. In both cases, an individual j is drawn randomly from the population. If j is infected and a recovery event has been selected then j will become susceptible (or recovered, model dependent) with probability \u03b4. If j is susceptible and an infection event occurs, then j will get infected with probability \u03bb if a randomly chosen neighbor of j is infected. The quasi-stationary distributions are computed (in the case of the SIS model) as the fraction of time the population spends in each configuration (i.e., number of infected individuals) during 109 disease event updates (107 generations; under asynchronous updating, one generation corresponds to N update events, where N is the population size; this means that in one generation, every individual has one chance, on average, to update her epidemic state). The average number of infected \u3008I\u3009 and the mean average degree of the network \u3008k\u3009\u2217 observed during these 107 generations are kept for further plotting. We have checked that the results reported are independent of the initial number of infected in the network. Finally, for the SIR and SI models, the disease progression in time, shown in the following sections, is calculated from 104 independent simulations, each simulation starting with 1 infected individual. The reported results correspond to the average amount of time at which i individuals become infected.",

In the present study, individual decision is based on available local information about the health state of one\u2019s contacts. Thus, we can study analytically the limit in which the network dynamics \u2014 resulting from adaptation to the flow of local information \u2014 is much faster than disease dynamics, as in this case, one may separate the time scales between network adaptation and contact (disease) dynamics: The network has time to reach a steady state before the next contact takes place.

The amount of information available translates into differences mostly between the break-up rates of links that may involve a potential risk for further infection (b\nSI, b\nIR\n, b\nII), and those that do not (b\nSS, b\nSR, b\nRR). Therefore, we consider one particular rate b\nI for links involving infected individuals (b\nI \u2261 b\nSI = b\nIR = b\nII), and another one, b\nH, for links connecting healthy individuals (b\nH \u2261 b\nSS = b\nSR = b\nRR). In general, one expects b\nI to be maximal when each individual has perfect information about the state of her neighbors and to be (minimal and) equal to b\nH when no information is available, turning the ratio between these two rates into a quantitative measure of the efficiency with which links to infected are severed compared to other links. Note that we reduce the model to two break-up rates in order to facilitate the discussion of the results. Numerical simulations show that the general principles and conclusions remain valid when all break-up rates are incorporated explicitly. It is worth noticing that three out of these six rates are of particular importance for the overall disease dynamics: b\nSS, b\nSR and b\nSI. These three rates, combined with the rate c of creating new links, define the fraction of active SS, SR and SI links, and subsequent correlations between individuals [76], and therefore determine the probability for a susceptible to become infected (see Models and Methods). This probability will increase when considering higher values of c (assuming b\nI > b\nH). In other words, when individuals create new links more often, therefore increasing the likelihood of establishing connections to infected individuals (when present), they need to be better informed about the health state of their contacts in order to escape infection. In the fast linking limit, the other three break-up rates (b\nII, b\nIR and b\nRR) will also influence disease progression since they contribute to changing the average degree of the network.",

Strictly speaking, a dynamical network does not change the disease dynamics at the local level, meaning that infected individuals pass the disease to their neighbors with probability intrinsic to the disease itself. At the population level, on the other hand, disease progression proceeds as if the infectiousness of the disease effectively changes, as a result of the network dynamics. Consequently, analyzing a temporal network scenario at a population level can be achieved via a renormalization of the transmission probability, keeping the (mathematically more attractive) well-mixed scenario. In this sense, from a well-mixed perspective, dynamical networks contribute to changing the effective infectiousness of the disease, which becomes frequency and information dependent. Note further that this information dependence is a consequence of using a single temporal network for spreading the disease and information. Interestingly, adaptive networks have been shown to have a similar impact in social dilemmas [63]. From a global, population-wide perspective, it is as if the social dilemma at stake differs from the one every individual actually plays.",

Whenever \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e, we can characterize the disease dynamics analytically, assuming a well-mixed population (complete graph), whereas for \u03c4 \u2192 0 we recover the analytical results obtained in the fast linking limit. At intermediate time scales, Fig. 13.7 shows that as long as \u03c4 is smaller than ten, network dynamics contributes to inhibit disease spreading by effectively increasing the critical infection rate. Overall, the validity of the time scale separation extends well beyond the limits one might anticipate based solely on the time separation ansatz. As long as the time scale for network update is smaller than the one for disease spreading (\u03c4 < 1), the analytical prediction for the limit \u03c4 \u2192 0, indicated by the lower dashed line in Fig. 13.7, remains valid. The analytical result in the extreme opposite limit (\u03c4 \u2192 \u221e), indicated by the upper dashed line in Fig. 13.7, holds as long as \u03c4 > 105. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the network dynamics influences the disease dynamics both by reducing the frequency of interactions between susceptible and infected, and by reducing the average degree of the network. These complementary effects are disentangled in intermediate regimes, in which the network dynamics is too slow to warrant sustained protection of susceptible individuals from contacts with infected, despite managing to reduce the average degree (not shown). In fact, for \u03c4 > 10 the disease dynamics is mostly controlled by the average degree, as shown by the solid lines in Fig. 13.7. Here, the average stationary distribution was determined by replacing, in the analytic expression for static networks, \u3008k\u3009 by the time-dependent average connectivity \u3008k\u3009\u2217 computed numerically. This, in turn, results from the frequency dependence of \u3008k\u3009. When b\nI > b\nH, the network will reshape into a configuration with smaller \u3008k\u3009 as soon as the disease expansion occurs. For \u03c4 < 1, \u3008k\u3009\u2217 reflects the lifetime of SS links, as there are hardly any infected in the population. For 100 < \u03c4 < 103, the network dynamics proceeds fast enough to reduce \u3008k\u3009, but too slowly to reach its full potential in hindering disease progression. Given the higher fraction of infected, and the fact that SI and II links have a shorter lifetime than SS links, the average degree drops when increasing \u03c4 from 1 to 103. Any further increase in \u03c4 leads to a higher average degree, as the network approaches its static limit.",

We argue, however, that the differences obtained stem mostly from the temporal aspect of the network, and not so much from the detailed dynamics that is implemented. Importantly, temporal network dynamics leads to additional changes in R\n0 compared to those already obtained when moving from the well-mixed assumption to static networks [77]. An important ingredient of our model, however, is that the average degree of the network results from the self-organization of the network structure, and co-evolves with the disease dynamics. A population suffering from high disease prevalence where individuals avoid contact in order to escape infection will therefore exhibit a lower average degree than a population with hardly any infected individuals. Such a frequency-dependent average degree further prevents that containment of infected individuals would result in the formation of cliques of susceptible individuals, which are extremely vulnerable to future infection, as reported before [36, 51, 54].",

This approach allows for a direct comparison between analytical predictions and individual-based computer simulations, and for a detailed analysis of finite-size effects and convergence times, whose exponential growth will signal possible bistable disease scenarios. In such a framework, we were able to show that temporal adaptive networks in which individuals may be informed about the health status of others lead to a disease whose effective infectiousness depends on the overall number of infected in the population. In other words, disease propagation on temporal adaptive networks can be seen as mathematically equivalent to disease spreading on a well-mixed population, but with a rescaled effective infectiousness. In accord with the intuition advanced in the introduction, as long as individuals react promptly and consistently to accurate available information on whether their acquaintances are infected or not, network dynamics effectively weakens the disease burden the population suffers. Last but not least, if recovery from the disease is possible, the time for disease eradication drastically reduces whenever individuals have access to accurate information about the health state of their acquaintances and use it to avoid contact with those infected. If recovery or immunity is impossible, the average time needed for a disease to spread increases significantly when such information is being used. In both cases, our model clearly shows how availability of information hinders disease progression (by means of quick action on infected, e.g., their containment via link removal), which constitutes a crucial factor to control the development of global pandemics.",

This is for instance the case for diseases where recently infected individuals remain asymptomatic for a substantial period. The longer the incubation period associated with the disease, the less successful individuals will be in escaping infection, which in our model translates into a lower effective rate of breaking SI links, with the above mentioned consequences. Moreover, different (social) networks through which awareness of the health status of others proceeds may lead to different rates of information spread. One may take these features into account by modeling explicitly the spread of information through a coupled dynamics between disease expansion and individuals\u2019 awareness of the disease [31, 33].",

The impact of combining such effects, resulting from specific disease scenarios, with those reported here will depend on the prevalence of such additional effects when compared to link-rewiring dynamics. A small fraction of non-random links, or of ties which cannot be broken, will likely induce small modifications on the average connectivity of the contact network, which can be incorporated in our analytic expressions without compromising their validity regarding population wide dynamics. On the other hand, when the contact network is highly heterogeneous (e.g., exhibiting pervasive long-tail degree distributions), non-random events may have very distinct effects, from being almost irrelevant (and hence can be ignored) to inducing hierarchical cascades of infection [81], in which case our results will not apply.",
