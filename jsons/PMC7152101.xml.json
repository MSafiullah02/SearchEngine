It is a common cause for acute-onset vomiting, anorexia, and diarrhea in both dogs and cats, but should be differentiated from other problems that may cause similar clinical signs such as pancreatitis, hepatitis, and intestinal obstruction (see additional chapters under the textbook section Intraabdominal Disorders).1 Inflammation in the alimentary tract can be due to a wide variety of underlying causes, including dietary indiscretion, infectious organisms, toxins, immune dysregulation, and metabolic disorders, and may occur in both dogs and cats. A thorough history and physical examination may aid in uncovering an underlying cause, but often a specific cause is not identified. In most cases, supportive therapy, including appropriate fluid support, dietary modification, antiemetics, and gastric protectant agents, are sufficient for resolution of clinical signs. However, in severe cases acute decompensation can occur. This is usually secondary to volume depletion, fluid losses, and acid-base disturbances that occur because the intestinal tract cannot perform its normal hemostatic functions.",

The muscular layers serve to grind food into smaller particles and move it forward into the small intestine through the pyloric sphincter. Of equal importance are the glandular portions of the stomach, which include parietal cells (for secretion of hydrochloric acid), chief cells (for secretion of pepsinogen), and mucous-producing cells (which also secrete bicarbonate). The gastric mucosal barrier is able to keep hydrochloric acid and digestive enzymes within the lumen, and it prevents loss of plasma constituents into the stomach.2 Once the food particles are ground into small enough components, they pass through the pyloric sphincter into the beginning of the small intestine, known as the duodenum.\n",

            "text": "The small intestine of cats and dogs functions in both digestion and absorption of food and its nutrients, and is divided arbitrarily into the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.3 The mucosa of the small intestine is involved in both secretory and absorptive functions and contains a single layer of epithelial cells called enterocytes. The mucosa along the length of the small intestine is formed into villi, which are fingerlike projections into the intestinal lumen that enlarge the surface of the small intestine. Microvilli then form the \u201cbrush border\u201d to increase the surface area even more for digestion and absorption of nutrients. Enzymes found in this brush border aid in digestion of larger food molecules into smaller, more readily absorbable particles. Absorption may occur via specific transport mechanisms or by pinocytosis. The epithelial cells are also involved with absorption and secretion of electrolytes and water.3 Enterocytes are connected to each other by tight junctions, limiting absorption between cells, as well as preventing backflow of nutrients from the interstitium into the intestine. The life span of these enterocytes is likely somewhere between 2 and 5 days, and they start at the crypt (base of the villus) and migrate toward the intestinal lumen where they are shed. A healthy, intact mucosal lining is important for the integrity of the intestine. Any type of inflammation that disrupts this layer can lead to significant intestinal disease.4 It is also important to remember that the gastrointestinal (GI) tract absorbs about 99% of the fluid presented to it; therefore any damage to it can cause significant alterations in acid-base and fluid balances.5\n",

However, the proteins lost into the intestinal tract can include large proteins such as albumin and antithrombin III, both of which have important roles in homeostasis. Albumin, with a molecular weight of 69,000 daltons, contributes significantly to oncotic pressure. Loss of albumin through the GI tract can lead to reduced colloid osmotic pressure, which often leads to loss of fluid from the intravascular space. Although this is typically a gradual process, it can cause significant changes in the compartmentalization of fluids in the patient, which may require consideration when prescribing fluid therapy. If third spacing has occurred, it may be necessary to use colloidal fluids such as hydroxyethyl starch (Hetastarch) or human albumin, in addition to crystalloids, in order to prevent further intravascular fluid losses. Albumin has additional beneficial effects, such as its antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties.16\n",

Disadvantages of this method are that the samples are small, and biopsies cannot be performed distal to the duodenum. Ileal samples can be obtained if colonoscopy is performed, but this requires patient preparation (i.e., administration of cleansing enemas), which can cause decompensation in unstable animals resulting from fluid and electrolyte shifts. The other option for obtaining samples requires exploratory laparotomy. This is an excellent method for acquiring full-thickness biopsy samples of multiple areas of the GI tract (and other organs if they are found to be abnormal).
