We propose a heterogeneous infection rate model with human mobility for epidemic modeling, a preliminary version of which we have successfully used during DARPA Grand Challenge 2014. By linearizing the model and using weighted least squares, our model is able to quickly adapt to changing trends and provide extremely accurate predictions of confirmed cases at the level of countries and states of the United States. We show that during the earlier part of the epidemic, using travel data increases the predictions. Training the model to forecast also enables learning characteristics of the epidemic. In particular, we show that changes in model parameters over time can help us quantify how well a state or a country has responded to the epidemic. The variations in parameters also allow us to forecast different scenarios such as what would happen if we were to disregard social distancing suggestions.",

Predicting the speed and severity of infectious diseases like COVID-19 and allocating medical resources appropriately is central to dealing with epidemics. The role of data science in this issue was brought to light when in December 2013, the first cases of Chikungunya virus appeared in the Americas. In 2014 DARPA announced a Grand Challenge [1] to predict the spread of Chikungunya virus in 55 countries of the western hemisphere. Through monthly predictions and reevaluation over seven months, DARPA announced the top winners of the challenge which included our team [2] . While many winning methods relied on manual adjustments for generating predictions, ours was a completely automated approach, thus more generalizable. However, training such a model with rapidly changing epidemic trends is difficult. Often epidemic models are trained through numerical solutions to differential equations [3] or through Bayesian inference [4, 5] . Instead, we transform the model into a linear system and train it using weighted least squares. The more recent data is more heavily weighted to adapt to rapidly changing trends. Further, we explore various hyper-parameter selection strategies to identify the best model.",

Applying such machine learning-based models to a finer level (from countries to states/cities) and larger scale (more 'regions' of the world) brings unique challenges in terms of unreported/noisy data and large number of model parameters, which will be explored in a future work. In this paper, we present some of our initial results on country and state-level predictions. We forecast number of reported cases for US states and for all the countries. We understand that majority of the infections are conjectured to be unreported [6] . We still believe that number of reported cases is a good indicator of the stress on the healthcare system. Henceforth, \"number of infected cases\" refers to the number of reported cases. In future work, we plan to incorporate modeling of unreported cases informed by various ongoing antibodies studies. We are also developing an interactive customizable tool that can be used to perform predictions using our model. A preliminary version of the tool has been made publicly available 1 .",

Within every region (hospital/city/state/country), an individual can exist in either one of two states: susceptible and infected. A susceptible individual gets infected when in contact with an infected individual at a rate depending on when that individual got infected, i.e., rate of infection is \u03b2 1 for an individual infected at t \u2212 1, \u03b2 2 for an individual infected at t \u2212 2, and so on, thus resulting in k sub-states of infection. The hypothesis is that how actively one passes on the infection is affected by when they get infected. We assume that after being infected for a certain time, individuals no longer spread the infection, i.e., \u2203k, such that \u03b2 i = 0\u2200i > k. Also, people traveling from other regions can increase the number of infections in a given 1 https://jaminche.github.io/COVID-19/ region. We assume that this infection can happen because of human mobility. Suppose F (q, p) represents mobility from region q to region p. Our model is represented by the following system of equations.",

On the other hand, with bounded k = 1 and J < \u221e, the model is a variation of Suceptible-Infected-Released/Recovered (SIR) model [8] , where an infected individual is active for J units of time. While the model is applicable to any definition of regions, in this work, we focus on country-level and US state-level forecasts, only. Further, there is a lag between an individual contracting the virus and their case being reported. We do not account for this lag, assuming that it is constant. County-level and city-level forecasting accounting for the lag and unreported cases is planned for future work.",

The next three days are used as validation set to identify best hyper-parameters and the following three days are used as test set for evaluation. Table 2 shows validation and test errors for both variable and fixed hyperparameter selection scheme, each with and without travel. Observe that in all cases including travel data reduces RMSE in the test set. For US states, variable hyper-parameter scheme performs better, while for Global, fixed scheme has a lower RMSE. This may be due to lack of enough data resulting in overfitting of variable hyperparameter scheme. This is evident from the fact that the validation errors are much lower than the test errors. This observation also supports the decision of going forward with the ensemble approach instead of choosing one of variable or fixed schemes. ",

We note that Mississippi has been awarded between C and F since the reference day to early April for its \"Social Distancing\" score by Unacast 5 . This suggests that while \"Social Distancing\" score captures percentage reduction in average mobility, it does not provide the complete picture of the changes in infection dynamics. A visual inspection reveals that Mississippi has indeed shown significant change (Fig. 5) compared to reference day when number of infections were increasing much more rapidly. At country-level, Brazil has the best CRS with Japan at the bottom, among 22 countries selected based on a threshold of 1000 infections at reference day. Based on ERS, US tops the list with Japan at the bottom again. We emphasize that these rankings are sensitive to the reference day.",

On the other hand, ERS depends on number of current/past infections which are not completely controlled by changing policies.

While, currently our 'ensemble' approach is simply the average of the predictions using both schemes, the ideal approach may be a hybrid one, where a collection of regions share the same hyper-parameters. This is especially useful when there are very few cases in a region. Then the hyper-parameters and even the parameters for this region can be set to be equal to that of a \"similar\" region from where more data is available. One way to identify such similar regions is by clustering regions based on their trends in a previous epidemic. In this way, active reporting for COVID-19 can be used to improve forecast of the next epidemic at an early stage. We will explore this in a future work.",

The unreported cases can be classified into two categories: (i) unreported cases -those who get infected over the course of the epidemic but do not report it; and (ii) immune casesthose who have the antibodies without being infected during the epidemic. For unreported cases, we can add another state to our model: for an individual in the i th \"infected\" sub-state, a report will be made with probability \u03b3 p i . Thus, the total number of new reported cases is given by \u2206R = k i=1 \u03b3 p i \u2206I p t\u2212i . Then the parameters will be learned by fitting the reported cases to R p t . The immune cases can be modeled as considering them not-susceptible. Suppose, \u03c1 p is the probability of a randomly selected individual in region p to be immune. Then the number of susceptible individuals at time t is given by S p t = (1 \u2212 \u03c1 p )N p \u2212 I p t . We can integrate these cases complemented by the ongoing various anti-body studies and surveys that will assist with more accurate learning of the parameters. Learning these parameters from the data without considering these studies is difficult. This is due to the fact that the number of total cases, even if it is 100 times the reported cases, is currently a very small fraction of the population. As of now, we allow \u03b3 p i and \u03c1 p to be inputs in our model. These can be used to study long-term scenarios with various inputs. For example, Fig. 8 shows the number of new positive cases (reported) for various values of \u03b3 p i = \u03b3. ",

Our model incorporates a forgetting factor to quickly adapt to the rapidly changing trends due to the changing policies of how we respond to the epidemic. With a weighted least square training and identifying the right hyper-parameters, we are able to achieve highly accurate predictions. The parameters obtained over different time-intervals allow us to measure how various regions (states/countries) have responded to the epidemic. In particular, we have defined Contact Reduction Score and Epidemic Reduction Score that respectively measure reduction in transmission, and reduction in epidemic spread compared to a hypothetical scenario where a trend of a prior reference point were to continue. These varying parameters also represent different policies of the past, and hence allow us to simulate scenarios into the future. For instance, using the parameters learned up to the point before \"social distancing\" orders, we can forecast the trajectory of the epidemic, if everyone were to stop taking distancing precautions.",
