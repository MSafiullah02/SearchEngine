Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is one of the five enteric porcine CoVs described so far [2]. TGEV is classified in subgenus Tegacovirus of genus Alphacoronavirus, included in the family Coronaviridae into the order Nidovirales [3,4]. CoVs contain the largest known genome among RNA viruses, consisting in a single-stranded, positive-sense, 5\u2032-capped and polyadenylated RNA molecule of around 28 kb in length [5]. TGEV genomic RNA (gRNA) encodes replicase polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab), and a set of structural and accessory genes in the order 5\u2032-S-3a-3b-E-M-N-7-3\u2032 [6]. TGEV has both enteric and respiratory tropism, in contrast to other porcine enteric CoVs, making this virus a good model to analyze the molecular determinants of coronavirus tissue tropism.",

In addition, S protein is the main inducer of neutralizing antibodies and, indeed, many CoV vaccines are based in the expression of S protein or S protein domains [11,12,13,14]. We and others have demonstrated that, by modifying S protein sequence, CoV tropism is altered [15,16,17,18]. Moreover, species tropism could also be changed by introducing S protein sequences in the genomes of distantly related CoVs [19,20,21,22]. Previous work from our group, using targeted recombination between a respiratory helper virus (TGEV-PTV) and a minigenome derived from an enteric TGEV, showed that recombinant viruses containing mutations in the S gene region between nt 217 and 665 lack enteric tropism in vivo [16]. Moreover, the analysis of recombinant viruses between enteric TGEV-PUR46-MAD and respiratory TGEV-PTV, determined that nucleotides at positions 214 and 655 of S gene were determinants of the enteric tropism [15].",

            "text": "Porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) is a TGEV mutant that naturally appeared in the field, lacking enteric tropism [23,24]. PRCV contains a 227 amino acid deletion in the N-terminus of S protein (Figure 1), strongly suggesting that this region of TGEV S protein is important for the enteric tropism. In addition, we have previously shown that S protein binding to the host cell receptor, the porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN), was not enough to determine the enteric tropism, as both TGEV and PRCV bind pAPN [10]. By comparing TGEV and PRCV binding to cell surface sialoglycoproteins, it was proposed that TGEV binding to this type of molecules may facilitate enteric tract infection [25]. Nevertheless, the sialic acid binding domain identified in TGEV S protein is conserved in several TGEV-derived respiratory viruses with a full-length S gene, such as TGEV-PTV (Figure 1), suggesting the existence of additional determinants of enteric tropism in the S protein. PRCV genome also contains deletions in the C-terminus of S gene, in genes 3a, 3b, and the ORF1a region encoding nsp3. Then, the contribution of other S protein domains or other viral proteins to enteric tropism was for a long time an open question [26]. In fact, the relevance of S protein N-terminus in TGEV enteric tropism has even recently been questioned [27].",

The newly engineered virus had only a respiratory tropism and lost the ability to infect the enteric tract [30].

The respiratory TGEV virus already contained the domains binding to pAPN (aa 506\u2013655) and sialic acid (aa 145\u2013155), which were necessary but not sufficient for enteric tract infection. Our data clearly demonstrated that the nature of the nucleotide at position 655 of S gene (leading to a S219A mutation in S protein) was required to confer enteric tropism to the respiratory TGEV. Moreover, a 6 nt insertion at position 1124 (leading to Y374-T375insND in S protein) led to a virus highly stable in cell cultures and increased by 1000-fold the virus titers in the enteric tract.",

In addition, the SPTV contained an in-frame 6 nt deletion (Figure 2A). Based on previous data from our group [15,16], the attention was focused in the nucleotide substitutions located at the N-terminus of S protein. To identify the determinants for TGEV enteric tropism, a series of chimeric S proteins was designed, containing different SC11 domains into a SPTV background (Figure 2A). These mutants were introduced in the TGEV infectious cDNA, leading to the rescue of a set of recombinant viruses (rTGEV-Rs). All the rTGEV-Rs viruses were efficiently recovered, with titers in porcine swine testis (ST) cells ranging from 2 \u00d7 108 to 5 \u00d7 109 pfu/mL.",

Virus titers in the lung and intestine were analyzed at different days post-infection (Figure 3). As expected, the parental rTGEV-SPTV virus only replicated in the lung of infected piglets, while rTGEV-SC11 exhibited both enteric and respiratory tropism (Figure 3, left panels). The recombinant viruses rTGEV-Rs1, rTGEV-Rs2, rTGEV-Rs3, and rTGEV-Rs4 grew efficiently in the respiratory tract, but failed to grow in the enteric tract of the infected piglets (Figure 3, middle panels). Interestingly, rTGEV-Rs5, rTGEV-Rs6, and rTGEV-Rs7 grew both in respiratory and enteric tract (Figure 3, right panels), indicating that these viruses contained the S protein determinants of both enteric and respiratory tropism. It is worth noting that, in addition to the pAPN and sialic acid binding domains (present in all the rTGEV viruses engineered), the mutation U655 > G, leading to a S219A amino acid change, present in rTGEV-Rs5 virus was required for infection of the enteric tract (Figure 2B and Figure 3). Nevertheless, the addition of the 6 nt insertion at position 1124, leading to an Asn-Asp insertion between Tyr374 and Thr375 (Y374_T375insND), significantly increased virus growth in the gut, as rTGEV-Rs7 virus titers were 1000-fold higher than those of rTGEV-Rs5 virus (Figure 2B and Figure 3).",

In agreement with this observation, rTGEV-Rs6 and rTGEV-Rs7 also exhibited enteric tropism (Figure 2B). Nevertheless, U655>G was also present in rTGEV-Rs3 and rTGEV-Rs4 viruses, with an exclusive respiratory tropism (Figure 2B). Virus genetic instability may explain the differential behavior of rTGEV-Rs3 and rTGEV-Rs4 viruses compared with rTGEV-Rs5. To address this issue, independent clones were isolated from the viruses recovered from tissues and S gene was sequenced. It was observed that 100% of the isolated rTGEV-Rs3 virus clones included mutations and deletions in the SC11 inserted region (Figure 4). Each viral clone was then independently assayed in piglets, confirming that most of the recovered mutations (five out of six) led to viruses with exclusive respiratory tropism. Only one of the sequence variants (Rs3c4), representing one out of six viral clones, led to a virus showing partial enteric tropism with a titer in the enteric tract of 2 \u00d7 103 pfu/mL, 100-fold lower than that of the enteric C11 virus (Figure 4). Similarly, 100% of rTGEV-Rs4 viral clones included spontaneous mutations (Figure 4). Most of these changes, representing three out of four viral clones, led to viruses with only respiratory tropism. Interestingly, one of the observed mutated clones, Rs4c4, led to a virus with the same sequence as that of the engineered rTGEV-Rs5 virus and grew in the enteric tract (Figure 4). These data confirmed that 655U > G mutation was one determinant of the enteric tropism, but that another factor was required for optimum replication in the enteric tract.",

As previously observed, rTGEV-SC11 p8 virus had decreased virus titer in the gut compared with p2 (Table 1). In contrast, no significant difference in virus titer in enteric tract was observed between p2 and p8 rTGEV-Rs7 virus (Table 1). These data were further confirmed when rTGEV-Rs7 was used as an expression vector and virus was passed 16 times in cell cultures maintaining S protein sequence [32]. Therefore, Rs7 S protein sequence would be very useful to generate vaccine candidates that can be propagated in cell cultures without losing the enteric tropism and, therefore, maintaining all the immunogenic potential [1]. These vaccine candidates would be both for TGEV, including attenuating mutations [30], or for other viruses if TGEV is used as a viral vector [32].",

Additional requirements for enteric tropism were identified in this work. We have engineered a mutated rTGEV-Rs7 enteric virus that differs from a respiratory recombinant virus (rTGEV-SPTV) in just two locations in the S gene: U655>G and a 6 nt insertion at position 1124, leading to S219A and a Y374_T375insND insertion in S protein, respectively. It is worth pointing out that the 6 nt insertion was also present in the respiratory PRCV, although this virus lacks the sialic acid binding domain (Figure 1). Interestingly, comparing viruses containing both sialic acid and pAPN binding domains showed that, as occurs in respiratory rTGEV-SPTV virus, many TGEV enteric isolates contain a deletion at position 1124, such as strains WH-1 (GenBank HQ462571), USA/Z/1986 (GenBank KX900393), HX [33] or TH-98 (GenBank KU729220), strongly suggesting that this sequence alone is not a determinant of enteric tropism. By comparing our results on rTGEV-Rs5 and rTGEV-Rs7 viruses, it can be concluded that the presence of Y374_T375insND significantly increased the growth of TGEV in the enteric tract (around 1000-fold). In addition, it could also be strongly suggested that this sequence insertion may help virus stability in cell culture.",

This mutation led to a S219A change in S protein, resulting in the elimination of a predicted glycosaminoglycan (GAG) attachment site. Then we postulated that, during adaptation to cell cultures, TGEV viruses acquire the U655>G mutation to increase GAG binding. GAG association with TGEV has been described [34,35]. And the use of GAGs as attachment factors in cell cultures has been described for other enteric CoV, the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) [36]. Very often, the interaction between viruses and GAGs traps virus progeny, inhibiting virus release and spread [37]. We hypothesized that the cell-culture adapted virus, containing the additional GAG binding site, may have decreased ability to traffic through the enteric tract to reach its target tissues and, as a consequence, has reduced virulence. Similar findings were described for other RNA viruses, such as foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) [38], alphaviruses [39,40,41], and flaviviruses [42,43,44,45], reinforcing our postulate.",

            "text": "There are 12 additional predicted GAG binding sites in the S1 domain of SC11 or Rs7, which are also present in the same domain of SPTV. This fact, together with the observation that non-engineered mutations introduced in vivo into the S1 domain of the spike protein of rTGEV-Rs3 and rTGEV-Rs4 viruses abrogated enteric tropism, suggests that structural constrains in the S protein of the N-terminal region may have a role in the determination of the enteric tropism. Unfortunately, the structural information on TGEV S protein is limited to the APN binding region (aa 506 to 655) (Figure 5A) [10], not allowing the location of S219A mutation in the experimentally determined S protein structure. As an alternative, S1 domains (aa 1 to 818) were modeled using RaptorX web server [46]. The prediction showed limited differences between the SPTV and Rs7 structures (Figure 5A). One of the biggest differences was in the vicinity of Ser219, changing the predicted orientation of the loop including aa 219 (Figure 5B). Moreover, this structural perturbation may also affect some loops in antigenic site B and the sialic acid binding domain (Figure 5B). Interestingly, the Y374_T375insND also may produce a structural change affecting antigenic site D and S protein loops which are close to the pAPN binding residues (Figure 5C). Therefore, it could be postulated that S219A and Y374_T375insND mutations, present in rTGEV-Rs7, may structurally favor interactions with host cell receptors.",

Plasmid pGEMT-SC11-1881 was digested with NcoI and BsmI to get Rs1 fragment, with NcoI and NsiI for Rs2 fragment, with NcoI and MscI for Rs3 fragment and with NsiI and MscI for Rs4 fragment. Plasmid pGEMT-SMAD-1881 was digested with NsiI and MscI to get Rs5 fragment. All these fragments were cloned into the same restriction sites in pGEMT-SPTV-1881. The obtained plasmids were subsequently digested with NcoI and XhoI and the fragments were cloned in pGEMT-SPTV plasmid, containing nucleotides 20,287 to 24,811 of TGEV-SPTV genome and engineered PacI and MluI restriction sites [30], generating plasmids pGEMT-Rs1, pGEMT-Rs2, pGEMT-Rs3, pGEMT-Rs4, and pGEMT-Rs5.
