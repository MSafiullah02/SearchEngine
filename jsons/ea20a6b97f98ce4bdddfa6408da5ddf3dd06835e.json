On the one hand, research has been focused on the configuration of networks, including the degree distribution, the clustering coefficient, and the assortativity etc., which reveals that simple dynamical rules, such as preferential attachment or selective rewiring, can generate complex topologies [1, 2, 4\u221213] . Many of these rules are not only useful for the generation of model graphs, but also believed to shape real-world networks like the Internet or the network of social contacts. On the other hand, attention has been paid to the dynamics in complex networks [14\u221222] . These studies have shown that the network topology can have a strong impact on the dynamics of the nodes, e.g., the availability of the percolation condition for networks with degree-degree correlation or the detrimental effect of assortative degree correlations on targeted vaccination. In the past, the cross fertilization between these two lines of thought has led to considerable advances. However, the network topology and the dynamics on networks are still generally studied separately and there is still a large enough space to combine them. One of the representative examples is how the epidemic is spread in complex networks.",

Next, we discuss how an epidemic is spread between two connected communities in Section 4. This problem has been recently addressed in the static community networks by Newman et al. [17, 27\u221229] and Liu et al. [30] where the community structures are fixed and the epidemic can be only spread from one community to another one through the links between them.

For example, some diseases have immunization ability where a person cannot be infected again once he/she was infected one time, such as a computer virus and gonorrhea, etc. Other diseases have no immunization ability where a person can be infected again even if he/she was infected one time, such as parotitis, measles, and influenza, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to build different models to model them. In fact, a large number of models have been presented to describe different situations of epidemic spreading. Two of the typical models are the SIS model and the SIR model. As being close to real society, scale-free (SF) networks are the most popular networks in which disease spreading is studied. The absence of epidemic thresholds on scale-free networks has attracted lots of attention [33, 34] .",

Another implicit assumption of this model is that the time scale of the disease is much smaller than the lifespan of individuals; therefore we do not include in the equation terms accounting for the birth or natural death of individuals. Different from the SIS model, here the infection is measured by the final infected population r \u221e .

Because A is the \"father\" of B, A will not be at the same footing with the other neighbors of B. When A is chosen from the neighbors of B, B will become the refractory with the probability of unity according to the propagation rules. When one of the other neighbors of B, except A, is chosen, B becomes the refractory or remain as infected, depending on the status of the chosen node. That is, the probability for B to become refractory is less than unity. If the degree of B is k, the probability for choosing A is 1/k and the probability of choosing the others is 1 \u2212 1/k.

At each time step, every infected node contacts one of its neighbors, i.e., the nodes that are connected to it. If this node is susceptible, it will be infected; otherwise, the original infected node itself will lose interest in the rumor and become refractory. The whole process continues until time T at which there is no infected node. We count the refractory nodes with degree k, n k,R (T ), and the total nodes with degree k, N k N , and then calculate the final density of infected nodes with degree k through \u03c1(k) = n k,R (T )/N k N . We find that \u03c1(k) increases monotonously with k when k < 35 and stay at \u03c1(k) = 1 or nearby when k 35. The result is shown by \"circles\" in Fig. 2(a) . Now we calculate the theoretical value of \u03c1(k) through Eq. (37) . The exponent \u03b1 is obtained through its expression by calculating all the s k at t = T and then substituting \u03b1 into Eq. (37) to get \u03c1(k). \"squares\" in Fig. 2(a) shows how the theoretical \u03c1(k) changes with k. Comparing the \"circles\" with the \"squares\" in Fig. 2(a) one can see that the theoretical results are consistent with the numerical experiments very well.

            "text": "Then we investigate how \u03c1 R varies with the structure parameter p. In numerical experiments, we produce different network structures for different p and randomly choose different seeds. Once the process of rumor spreading is over, we count the number N R N (T ) of the total final infected nodes for all the degree k and calculate the density \u03c1 R through \u03c1 R = N R N (T )/N . The result is shown in Fig. 3 by the \"circles\". For comparison, we also calculate the \u03c1 R through Eq. (39) (see \"squares\" in Fig.  3 ). Obviously, in Fig. 3 \"squares\" are very close to \"circles\". Furthermore, from Fig. 3 it is easy to see that \u03c1 R increases with the structure parameter p. This can be explained as follows: For the networks with the same average degree, scale-free network has more nodes with larger degree than that in the random network. Therefore, in scale-free networks with p = 0 the rumor can be easily transmitted to the hub nodes with the heaviest degree and then to the other nodes. Once the hub nodes are in the infected or refractory status, it will be easy for the other infected nodes to become refractory as they have larger probability to be connected to the hub nodes than to the other nodes. When the infected nodes choose the hub nodes as their targets of rumor spreading, they themselves become refractory. This feature disappears in the random network with p = 1, which results in a faster ending of rumor spreading in a scale-free network than in a random network. A social network has a community structure [27\u221230] . The community may be classmates, friends, co-workers, and club members etc. In a social network, there are groups of nodes with many connections between their members and few connections to nodes outside the group, see the schematic Fig. 4 . Thus, social networks have completely different structures with the above discussed general networks. Several approaches have been presented to construct the community networks [27\u221230, 56\u221260] . In this section, we follow the Ref. [30] to discuss how a community structure affects the infectious propagation. ",

We take N 0 N N = 1000, N = 4 \u00d7 10 4 , m = 10, and 100 configurations with different sets of random numbers m 1 (i), i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , m. For each configuration, we take 100 different initial conditions with exactly one randomly chosen node infected. Thus we have 10 4 realizations. For each individual realization, the epidemic process will depend on its structure and the chosen seed. We find that, all the epidemic processes in the 10 4 realizations for small \u03bb will die after a finite time, and only part of them will die for a relatively large \u03bb, as shown in Fig. 5 for two typical processes where n(t) is the infected number of individuals at time t. From both Fig.  5 (a) and (b) we can see that there are a lot of peaks corresponding to the disease quickly spreading through a community and then waiting to jump to the next one. To check Eqs. (41) and (42), Fig. 6 shows the results of numerical simulations where (a) represents how \u03bb c depends on N for fixed \u03c3 and (b) how \u03bb c depends on \u03c3 for fixed N when \u03c3 1. The slopes of the two lines in Fig. 6(a) are unity, confirming \u03bb c linearly decrease with N for fixed \u03c3 in (41). In Fig. 6(b) , the dashed line shows that the \"circles\" can be fitted into a straight line of slope unity when \u03c3 > 200, confirming Eq. (42) which is obtained under the condition \u03c3 1. These results show that, with the decrease of the degree of community, the epidemic threshold of the community network will increase and reach its maximum at the limit of random network. For larger spreading rate, it is easier for the epidemic on a random network to have global reach than that of a community network. ",

Considering the fact that the links between groups may also influence the epidemic spreading, the nodes in a group are not in the same position because some nodes have only the links in the group, while the others have both the links in the group and the links between the groups. This will result in the different infection rates for the neighbors of a node. As the differences change with time, let us treat it as a fluctuation of the infection rate. Considering that the influence/fluctuation from other groups will be stronger for the larger probability \u03bb of contagion, Eq. (43) will be modified as (46) where \u03be(n) is a uniform noise in [0, 1] and D is the noisy strength. Figure 7 shows the stabilized solution of Eq. (46) . Obviously, it is period-1 for 0.015 < \u03bb < 0.23 and period-2 for \u03bb > 0.23, and the period-1 approaches x(n) = k /2 = 30 when \u03bb approaches to 0.23. Now we use the SIRS model to reconsider this situation [61] . Our numerical simulation shows that the periodic waves are also possible in the SIRS model if we take a proper parameter \u03c4 I \u03c4 and \u03c4 R \u03c4 . A difference from the SIS model is that, there are two thresholds \u03bb c1 and \u03bb c2 for the SIRS model. The periodic waves exist only when \u03bb c1 < \u03bb < \u03bb c2 and disappear when out of this range. The reason for \u03bb c1 is the same as in the SIS model. The reason for \u03bb c2 is that the existence of the interval \u03c4 I \u03c4 makes more people become infected and hence it is possible for all of them to become refractory during the time interval \u03c4 R \u03c4 . Once it happens, the epidemic spreading will be ended. Figure 8 shows a typical pattern of periodic wave when \u03bb is in between the range [\u03bb c1 , \u03bb c2 ] where (a) represents the change of the infected locations with time and (b) shows how the infected number changes with time. Combined with the results obtained in the SIS model, we see that the epidemic spreading in the community network has illustrated the spatio-temporal wave and may shed light on the understanding of the mechanism of DHF.

It is generally believed that a community is safe if its connections to the surrounding infected communities are removed [64, 67] . However, the real situations are very complex. On one hand, there is a time delay between the infection of an agent and the knowledge of its status by others, which causes some difficulty to timely figure out the dangerous connections. On the other hand, the epidemic spreading may go through a third one, i.e., a community between a safe community and an infected one. However, to sustain the normal function of a community, we cannot remove all its connections to the surroundings, i.e., the connections to its safe surroundings should remain. Thus, if one of our neighboring community contacts with an infected community, how is our community influenced through the neighboring community?",

To keep \u03bb = 0.1 in between [\u03bb c1 , \u03bb c2 ], we let L 2 increase from 1 to 2.4 for r = 0.05 and let r change from 0.03 to 0.055 for L 2 = 1. Our numerical simulations have confirmed the prediction Eq. After understanding the mechanism of epidemic spreading in a model of two communities, let us move to the model of three communities, i.e., epidemic spreading through an indirect contagion. This situation occurs very often in reality. For example, when an epidemic breaks out in a community, its surrounding communities will usually remove the links with it to keep their safety. While for those communities not connected directly to the infected one, they will not remove the connections to their surroundings. Suppose one neighbor of the infected community does not remove its links between them in time, how the neighbor's neighbor is influenced by the infected community through an indirect way? To solve this problem, let's construct a model of three communities as shown in Fig. 14 where A 1 denotes the infected community with higher density of agents, A 2 and A 3 denote the safe communities with lower density of agents. The jumping is allowed between A 1 and A 2 and also between A 2 and A 3 but forbidden between A 1 and A 3 . For simplicity, we let all the three communities have the same population N = 1000 and the same jumping possibilities p between A 1 and A 2 and also between A 2 and A 3 . We assume L 1 < L 2 = L 3 . Hence, the density of agents in A 1 is higher than that in A 2 and A 3 , and the epidemic threshold \u03bb c1 of A 1 is smaller than \u03bb c2 of A 2 and A 3 . Like the discussed model of two communities, here we let the three communities have the same contagion rate \u03bb and are also interested in the case of \u03bb c1 < \u03bb \u03bb c2 . Making the similar analysis, we find that the safety of the third community cannot be guaranteed even if it is not directly connected with the infected community, see the details in Ref. [73] . We have briefly reviewed the epidemic and rumor propagation in complex networks, especially in community networks. The main results are as follows: (1) For the rumor propagation in complex networks, we find that the degree distribution influences seriously the final density of infected nodes. The homogeneous networks are more prevalent than the heterogeneous networks. (2) A simplified community model has been presented, which is highly clustered and has nonsymmetric connectivity distribution. We have also constructed a community network model with varying clustering coefficients and varying SF degree distribution to study the influence of community structure on epidemic spreading. This model shows that the clustering is against the epidemic spreading. (3) A dynamical community network is presented to discuss the influence of the mobile feature of agents on the epidemic spreading. We find that for the case of direct and indirect connection, it is possible to sustain an epidemic spreading even when the contagion rate \u03bb is smaller than its critical threshold, which is impossible for an isolated community.",

The reaction processes account for the possibility that individuals in the same location may get in contact and change their state according to the infection dynamics, and the diffusion processes account for the spreading of the epidemic.
