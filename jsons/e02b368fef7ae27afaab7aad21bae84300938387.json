A Sikh man just walked past a cherry tree in the garden on the next road over from ours. The cherry tree is in blossom, and the silver birches on that road and the young oak tree in the garden just down from where I sit are in the process of leafing-up. The beauty of this is that I can see the return of the blue tits and great tits as they feed on-and-in the Buddleia, and skip between those trees. I can see a heron following the line of the brook towards Braunstone Park each day. I have seen a little egret heading the other way.",

Placing people and individual/collective well-being at the centre pushes back against the idea of the University-as-was before Covid-19, which demanded that academic commodities take centre stage. These commodities are the things that higher education (HE) in the global North says that it values, like project deliverables, research outputs, public engagement activities, or human capital in the form of graduate earnings. Under the treadmill of competition between national HE sectors, institutions, subjects, and individuals, there is a demand that these things are quantified and turned into proxy metrics so that judgements can be made about performance. Competitive edge sets individuals against each other in a scramble for value, which in turn damages our physical and emotional species-being, communality, and sense-of-self (Dyer-Witheford 2004; Engels 1845 Engels /2009 Marx 1845 Marx /1974 .",

This is why I have felt the need to maintain contact, in spite of the fact that this can be exhausting, because how else might we live with the uncertainty and anxiety of the virus and the horizon of loss that nears us? The virus highlights the claustrophobic nature of our work, and how our lives as-they-were forced us to centre our labour rather than ourselves.

How will current assessment regimes be reorganised? How will the next academic session be managed under full or partial lockdown? In order to situate business continuity in response to these questions, universities have moved to protect the integrity of their physical infrastructure by closing or reducing access to estates. At the same time, they have challenged academic and professional services staff to find new articulations of institutional and personal digital technologies, in order to maintain student-facing services and the mirage of business-as-usual.",

It has infected our corporeal existence and the fabric of our institutions and ways of life, showing how the very ways in which capitalist social relations have exhausted us have left us more susceptible.

The separation of academics from control over the labour process, the things they produce, themselves, and their peers is amplified through performance anxiety, such that the University has become an anxiety machine (Hall and Bowles 2016) . Inside the collective uncertainty generated by the Covid-19 pandemic, the anxiety machine seeks to maintain its motive energy and its internal integrity, in spite of the broader terrain of individual and collective hypertension. In seeking to maintain the validity of academic commodity fetishism through business continuity strategies, the University has brought the humanity of the concrete lived experiences of staff and students, realised in learning and teaching, technical work in laboratories and studios, public engagement, mentoring, librarianship, and so on, into asymmetrical relation with the abstract demands of intellectual property, academic privilege and status, and the exchange of academic commodities.",

We are further separated-out and at-risk in our labour as we self-isolate. The virus has revealed how the abstract power of finance capital, the market, and the need to generate surpluses deny the potential humanity of academic work and study. In seeking to preserve its forms or structures, the University presents its cultures as pathologies, governed by activities that are methodological, in generating a disconnect between the concrete, lived reality of academics, professional services staff and students, and the abstract idea of the business. We understand the pandemic as academia's shock doctrine (Kornbluh 2020) , as staff are placed in the front line of risk management in a crisis, without revealing the modelling or risk assessment behind this. The risk is that this turns a temporary exertion into a permanent expectation, and to a permanent state of exception inside HE. In turn, the potential for further defunding, casualisation, monitoring and surveillance, and unbundling of the curriculum is revealed. If senior managers can force business-as-usual in spite of exceptional circumstances, as a means of protecting and sustaining the economy of the corporate form, then further revolutionising is possible. The existing forces and relations of academic production, re-engineered through a decade of austerity, are under renewed stress for transformations that discipline labour (Hall 2019a) .",

Thus, I am rethinking my book project, The Hopeless University: Intellectual Work at the end of the End of History, because the idea of the University has been shattered by coronavirus (Hall 2019b) . My argument takes the University as the unit of analysis at a time when its political economy is up for discussion once more. The University is up for discussion because it has become hopeless in the twin sense that it is a space devoid of hope and because its forms/ structures, cultures/pathologies, and activities/methodologies appear useless beyond business continuity in the face of a pandemic.",

This is no longer The End of History in which there is no alternative to capitalism, rather this is a desperate need to question the purpose of the capitalist University at the end of The End of History (Aufhebunga 2019; Fukayama 1992). The pandemic forces us to question whether it is easier to imagine the end of the world (and of our humane values) than it is the end of the capitalist University (and its drive for economic value) (Jameson 1994, following Franklin 1979)?",

The daily, repetitive, symptomatic illnesses of University labour, normally revealed as performance anxiety, overwork, hopelessness, and uncertainty are amplified in this crisis of Covid-19. The ways in which University workers attempt to cauterise or ignore their wounds usually focuses on the maintenance and reproduction of privilege and status and surplus masquerading as a labour of love, and this becomes more apparent in this urgent call for business-as-usual. We are told that we must continue to self-harm, and that this is culturally acceptable, because this is a service of love inside the University-as-family. Our labour of love has crashed into our senior managers' need for surplus and the extraction of surplus, and the dependence upon particular income streams or modes of student and institutional debt. But as the crisis intensifies, and healthcare get stretched, and people have no income, and access to food becomes a new mode of anxiety, how will the abstract, hopeless University continue to ignore the concrete, lived realities of those who labour for it?",

I am thinking about the podcasts that mean so much to me, and how I make time to sit and listen to them, rather than listening whilst doing something else. And this will not be forever. In the Border Trilogy, McCarthy (2013: 824) has one of his elderly, wise characters state, in response to a conversation about the fragility of young love: 'it is an uncertain business\u2026 You must persevere. To persevere is everything'. This is what I learned from a decade in therapy: perseverance. We persevere through the events and relationships that cause us so much pain. And the pain is a new opportunity to learn and grow from our need to persevere. Part of my process is listening to the world as it has been recalibrated through shock, in a way that forces me to think through the potential for a transformation to another world beyond this capitalist dystopia that we have made. I think about the psychological shock of closing down what is, and trying to reimagine what might be. But first, I must mourn.",

The capitalist University cannot save us, because it is driven by short-term economic interests, rather than the long-term conditions of life. It is pathological; it is diseased; it functions through cultures of silence, obfuscation, paranoia, intensification, and wait and see. It has lost control of the anxiety that gave it form and content through overwork and ill-being. This very anxiety has tipped beyond uncertainty into contempt, fear, anger, and disbelief. This anxiety has made real the undercommons of the University as a moment of survival and of fugitive planning (Moten and Harney 2013) . Our hope lies in understanding how crises are the very material of capitalist expansion, predicated upon the renewed exploitation of life and living labour, and in returning to struggle. Academic labourers, professional services' staff, and students are in a very real struggle inside-and-against the University. We have generated new energy and new organising power through our strikes against inequality, casualisation, workload, and precarious futures. What do we do now with our indignation at the handling of Covid-19? How do we respond to the institutional focus upon its own economic and financial welfare, over our corporeal and psychological well-being? I am reminded that years ago, I spoke and wrote about whether universities care enough about students, or whether universities care too much about students. I argued:",

This is the true psycho-social scope of care in these educational relationships. (Hall 2012) ",
