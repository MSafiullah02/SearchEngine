This virus has made us consider afresh our own lives and relations with other people, our own consumption patterns, our access to natural places, and above all our health. Slow trends will speed up, some for the greater good, some not. We might come to think this was a rehearsal for how economies could be shattered by a climate crisis. One thing has become very clear: when faced with existential threat, we put our value on those working for the public good. Individuals working alone or for themselves will not be able to mitigate or solve this pandemic and its ripple effects. Could this open up a space for more collective and socially-oriented action in agricultural and food systems? And might the planet and our economies come out of this better placed to produce sustainable, equitable and healthy systems for all people?",

A wide range of different types of more sustainable agriculture have recently been developed and implemented, most centring on the notion that making more of existing land by sustainable intensification and collective action can result in synergistic co-production of food and ecosystem services. Yet at the same time, agriculture is still contributing to biodiversity loss, nutrient loading of the biosphere, climate forcing, depletion of aquifers and surface water, and pollution of air, soil and water (Rockstr\u00f6m et al. 2017).",

Redesign is a social and institutional challenge, as landscape-scale changes are needed for positive contributions to biodiversity, water quantity and quality, pest management and climate change mitigation. Three non-linear stages were identified: efficiency, substitution and redesign (Hill 1985; Pretty 2018).",

Social capital increases trust, reciprocity and mutual obligations, and creates norms that guide behaviours. We have recently also undertaken a global assessment of intentionally-formed social capital manifested as collaborative groups within specific geographic areas. This focused on collective action for integrated pest management, joint forest management, watersheds and land, water sharing, microfinance, and innovation platforms. The number of groups worldwide has grown from 0.5 M at about 2001\u201303 to 8.5 M (2018) across 55 countries. Farmers and land managers working together with scientists and extensionists in these forms of social infrastructure have improved natural capital and agricultural productivity.",

There are of course also many other institutions, corporations and groups of individuals actively engaged in resource depletion to serve private and generally short-term interests.",

Some of this social capital will be influencing global systems, resulting for example in mitigations of climate change, biodiversity loss and air pollution, as well as increases in net food production. Platforms of groups, for example, could engage in co-production of new patterns of material consumption and ways of living within global boundaries and limits.",

Sustainability is a form of progressive and gradual change that requires changes in behaviours and practices as well as internal changes to mindsets. It could be that novel forms of social capital can open up science to innovation, particularly where problems are complex and solutions unknown, and where the values of all actors are salient.",
