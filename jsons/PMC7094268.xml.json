Although, the term \u201chydrogen bond\u201d has emerged in 1930 [1], the basic idea of a weak and specific interaction involving the atoms of hydrogen is much older [2], [3]. This relatively weak chemical force, only about 10% as strong as covalent bonds, has a very important effect on the chemical and physical properties of water. It is responsible for the tertiary structure of proteins, and also plays an important role in biological systems, involving DNA [4], [5], [6]. Nowadays, over 70 years later after Huggins\u2019 publication [1], the nature of the hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) in the solution and the solid phase is not fully understood.",

For instance, it has been observed that pyridine N-oxide (PyO) and 4-morpholino pyridine N-oxide are able to enhance the solubilization of silica in water, that is very important for the plant silicon content and pest resistance of the edible plants [13], [14]. Moreover, Zi\u0119ba et al. [16] investigated substituted pyridine N-oxides as a novel generation of the radio-sensitizers as a drug that makes tumour cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. The search for new hypoxic cell-specific radio-sensitizers has shown that amine N-oxides are better compounds in radiotherapy of cancer than the most promising nitroimidazoles. Furthermore, experiments carried out by Balzarini et al. revealed that pyridine N-oxide derivatives have inhibitory activity against the human SARS-CoV [17].",

An ESH 10-00 (Metron) indicator glass microelectrode and an EK10-00 (Metron) reference calomel microelectrode were used. A reference calomel microelectrode was filled with 0.1 mol \u00b7 dm\u22123 tetra-n-butylammonium chloride in non-aqueous solvent. All the E measurements were conducted at a constant ionic strength equal to 0.001 mol \u00b7 dm\u22123. This was kept stable by addition to the titrant of a salt solution in such a quantity as to equalize concentrations of both solutions. The titration cell initially contained 3 cm3 of N-oxide perchlorate and was thermostatted (Lauda E 100). Concentrations of the titrant N-oxides were 10\u22122\n mol \u00b7 dm\u22123 and those of the perchlorate N-oxides were 10\u22123\n mol \u00b7 dm\u22123. The titrant was added dropwise using a 2.5 cm3 Hamilton syringe with an accuracy of 0.01 cm3. The potential difference (E) was recorded for each titration point, when the measured potential was stable (no potential changes were observed for 150 s). The same potentiometric-titration procedure was implemented in the electrode calibration, with tetra-n-butylammonium picrate in the titrand and mixture of this salt and picric acid in the titrant. In the calculations of the standard potential difference (E\n\u2218) and slope (s), we used 11.0 [26] and 6.3 [27] as the values of pK\na for picric acid in acetonitrile (AN) and acetone (AC), respectively. Solutions for potentiometric measurements were prepared on a volume basis. For each system studied, 4 to 5 independent titrations were performed.

These constants reveal that cationic homoconjugation equilibria are present for all BH+/B systems in AC and AN. Furthermore, analysis of the homoconjugation constants shows that these values are charged with small standard deviations (0.02 to 0.19) for all 4-halopyridine N-oxide derivatives in both solvents studied. The homoconjugation constants obtained in acetonitrile are by a factor of about (0.06 to 0.63) greater (on average 0.32) than values determined in other aprotic solvents (acetone) with a greater donor number. This confirms the general tendency that the range of homoconjugation involving N-oxides increases with the decreasing donor properties of the solvent. The smaller values of homoconjugation constants in acetone in relation to acetonitrile can be interpreted as being due to a stronger solvation of cationic acids (BH+) constituents of the hydrogen-bonded complexes by the more basic acetone, thus weakening the hydrogen bonding. Consequently, based on the results of our previous [41] and present studies, the sequence of non-aqueous solvents classified according to the increasing strength of cationic homoconjugation of organic N-bases with conjugate cationic acids, can be arranged as follows: nitromethane > benzonitrile > \nacetonitrile\n > propylene carbonate > \nacetone\n > methanol > N\u2032,N\u2032-dimethylformamide > dimethyl sulfoxide.",

Based on this, the correlation analysis was made between the lgKBHB+ values of the 4-halopyridine N-oxides in both solvents studied. As a result, after rejection of the most aberrant data points (2,5Me24ClPyO) the following relationship was obtained:(8)lgKBHB+AN=0.935(0.204)lgKBHB+AC+0.419(0.518)R=0.935where standard deviations are given in parentheses and R denotes the correlation coefficient.

The pK\na values in acetone are relatively low, of order of 5 (the highest value 5.86 being for the 3,5Me24BrPyO) and lower. This finding can be explained in terms of the presence of strong electron-accepting substituent (a halogen atom) at position 4. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that values of pK\na in acetonitrile for the conjugate acids of N-bases are by more than ten orders of magnitude lower than those of carboxylic acids pKaAN values falling in the range 17 to 21 [42], phenols pKaAN values are of the order of 16 to 27 [43] and only 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than those for mineral acids [44], including sulphuric acid (pKaAN=7.9), nitric and hydrochloric acid (pKaAN=8.9 for both). In addition, the pK\na values of the N-oxides studied in acetone (DN = 17) are by four orders of magnitude lower than those determined in acetonitrile (DN = 14.9), and two orders of magnitude higher than those in polar amphiprotic methanol (DN = 19.1 [19]).
