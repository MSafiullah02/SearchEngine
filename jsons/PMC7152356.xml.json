Respiratory viruses (e.g., influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus), enteroviruses (e.g., coxsackievirus, echovirus), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are frequent causes of pharyngitis. EBV pharyngitis often is accompanied by other clinical findings of infectious mononucleosis (e.g., generalized lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly) and can be exudative and indistinguishable from GAS pharyngitis. HSV pharyngitis often is associated with stomatitis in children and tends to affect the anterior oral mucosa, including the gingiva, buccal mucosa, and tongue. Enteroviral pharyngitis can be an isolated finding (e.g., herpangina) or part of the syndrome of hand-foot-and-mouth disease, and it has a typical appearance. Systemic infections with other viruses (e.g., cytomegalovirus, rubella virus, measles virus) can include pharyngitis.",

The face usually is spared, although the cheeks can be erythematous with pallor around the mouth (Fig. 27.1\n). After 3 to 4 days, the rash begins to fade and is followed by fine desquamation, first on the face and progressing downward. Occasionally, sheet-like desquamation occurs around the fingernails periungually, the palms, and the soles. Pharyngeal findings are the same as with GAS pharyngitis. The tongue usually is coated, and the papillae are swollen. With desquamation, the reddened papillae are prominent, giving the tongue a strawberry appearance.",

Although the use of cephalosporins for GAS pharyngitis could reduce the number of people (especially chronic carriers) who harbor GAS after completing therapy, empiric first-line use would be associated with substantial economic cost and risk for increased antimicrobial resistance without substantial benefit.
