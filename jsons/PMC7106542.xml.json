            "text": "Respiratory tract infection is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. While the clinical features of respiratory tract disease are easily recognized, the etiological agent responsible for disease is often not detected. In one study of community-acquired pneumonia, routine microbial investigation of sputum, blood, serology, and lower airway or pleural fluid (if available) lead to the identification of an etiological agent in only 46% of cases [1]. The etiology of a majority of lower respiratory tract infection is thought to be viral [2], yet in only 40% of cases can a viral agent be identified, even with use of state-of-the-art genomic amplification methods [3]. In children, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses, and influenza are known as the major causes of bronchiolitis and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). However, in up to a third of these cases, an infectious agent cannot be identified [4, 5]. This suggested that previously unidentified viruses may be circulating. Since 2001, many new human viruses have been discovered. Data from many studies have demonstrated that some of these new viruses are responsible, at least partly, for the disease that previously could not be attributed to common respiratory viruses such as RSV, rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, and adenoviruses. This review will focus on four new respiratory viruses, human metapneumovirus, human coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1, and the human bocavirus",

Paramyxoviruses are enveloped, single stranded RNA viruses of negative polarity meaning that their genomes must be transcribed to mRNA to be translated into protein. Serological studies of stored serum specimens suggested that hMPV had been circulating in the human population for more than 50 years [6]. By the age of 5 years, more than 90% of children have serological evidence of hMPV infection [6, 7, 8\u2022, 9]. There appear to be at least two major genotypes of hMPV, A and B [10]. There are conflicting data as to whether genotypes A and B represent distinct genotypes [10, 11].",

            "text": "hMPV infections have been identified worldwide [6, 12\u2022, 13, 14, 15] and has been shown to be the cause of both URI and LRTI in infants, young children [6, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], the elderly [20, 21, 22] and the immunocompromised populations [17, 23, 24]. Asymptomatic infection, at least in young children, appears to be uncommon [15]. In fact, in young children, hMPV is a major cause of bronchiolitis accounting for 5\u201315% of all cases [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 25]. The spectrum of disease caused by hMPV is similar to that of RSV. Both hMPV and RSV cause seasonal epidemics with the peak of hMPV activity typically overlapping or following the peak of RSV activity. Because of this, the potential for dual infection exist. One study reported that 70% of children with severe RSV bronchiolitis were co-infected with hMPV suggesting that the disease caused by RSV may be augmented by a concurrent hMPV infection [26]. However, population-based and case control studies of hospitalized children have found that hMPV and RSV co-infections are uncommon [19, 27]. hMPV can cause an influenza-like illness in adults [28] and has been associated with wheezing and asthma in young children [29], though this also occurs with other common respiratory viruses. The pathogenesis of hMPV-associated lower respiratory tract infection may involve co-infection with pneumococcus in some instances, as vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine reduced the incidence of hMPV-associated lower respiratory tract infection and clinical pneumonia in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children [30\u2022\u2022].",

Clinical features associated with hMPV infection included respiratory failure, pulmonary hemorrhage, and culture-negative septic shock [31\u2022]. However, this study did not sample asymptomatic patients, so a causal link between hMPV and disease could not be made. In fact, persistent symptomless hMPV infection has been reported in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients [32]. Recently, an outbreak of hMPV was reported in a long-term care facility [33\u2022\u2022]. In that study, half of the individuals with severe lower respiratory tract infection tested positive for hMPV, and of those, 50% died. Histopathological studies of tissue from one of the fatalities revealed distribution of hMPV antigen in the bronchiolar epithelium of affected lobes indicating that the virus was present at the site of the disease. This is one of the strongest demonstrations yet that hMPV causes lower respiratory tract disease.",

However, the effectiveness of ribavirin therapy for RSV is limited, at best, and remains a controversial issue. A humanized monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, has been approved for its use in high-risk infants (those with a history of prematurity, lung or cardiac diseases) to prevent serious disease due to RSV, though does not prevent infection and is not a therapeutic agent. An hMPV monoclonal antibody that neutralizes both genotype A and B viruses has been developed and has been shown to protect experimental animals from hMPV infection [38]. This molecule may have the potential as a prophylactic agent to protect against hMPV-related disease. Other compounds, such as NMSO3, a sulfated sialyl lipid has potent hMPV antiviral activity in cell culture assays [37].",

Overall, more than 8000 individuals were infected, and the case fatality rate was \u223c10%.

The virus is associated with respiratory tract disease in both children and adults. HCoV-NL63 may be a common cause of croup (laryngotracheitis). Of children <3 years of age who had relatively high viral loads and absence of another viral pathogen in nasopharyngeal secretions, 43% tested positive for HCoV-NL63 compared with 6% in the HCoV-NL63-negative group (p\n < 0.0001) [43].",

PARV4, a parvovirus phylogenetically distinct from HBoV has been detected in serum from HIV, hepatitis B virus infected, or hepatitis C virus infected individuals [56]. Two TT-(torqueteno) virus-like viruses have been identified in human sera [56]. Two new human polyomaviruses, KI and WU have been identified in secretions originating from the human respiratory tract [57\u2022, 58\u2022]. Polyomaviruses have oncogenic potential and therefore study of these new viruses is important. A novel virus, the mimivirus, is the largest (in size and genome) known virus, can be seen with light microscopy, and contains a genome that is larger than some bacteria [59]. Serological data suggest that the mimivirus may be a cause of pneumonia. However, the virus has not yet been isolated from individuals with pneumonia [60\u2022]. Clinical studies of these new viruses are lacking. Whether these new microbes are human pathogens remain to be defined. However, it is clear that the landscape of respiratory viruses continues to change.",

There is a need for an effective vaccine and antiviral compounds to protect against and treat hMPV-related disease. Like the previously known human coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 are associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract diseases though the burden of disease caused by these viruses remains to be fully determined. The full spectrum of disease associated with HBoV remains to be defined. Presence of the virus in respiratory secretions, serum, and stool suggests that this virus may cause systemic illness.",
