There are several convincing arguments for integration of these disparate systems of medicine. Integration is already helping patients with many chronic diseases [3], [4], severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [5], AIDS [6] and etc. Moreover, integration would be more economical for the health care system [7]. Even, integration would respond to the ever-increasing demand for complementary medicine and increased cultural sensitivity [8]. However, the confluence of biomedicine and CM presents many complex problems and opportunities for integration [9]. For example, it is quite common for a patient to seek herbal treatment while taking several prescription medications. Reasonably enough, patients want to know about possible interactions and compatibility when taking prescription drugs and herbs simultaneously. In addition, timing of herbal formulas and drugs use is largely due to theoretical or known risks of interactions with herb-drug. Such specific questions, unfortunately, are often difficult (not impossible) to answer.",

            "text": "Because many patients receive both CM and biomedical treatments concurrently, there is a great need to develop clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for rationally integrating assessment or treatment approaches from these two systems of medicine [10]. CPGs, important knowledge translation tools, are statements that include recommendations intended to optimize patient care that are informed by careful review of existing practice, and available published evidence on topic [11], [12]. Although the goal of all CPGs is the same, to assist patients and practitioners in making care decisions. However, different organizations/groups use different methodologies to develop CPGs for different systems of medicine [13], [14]. In biomedicine, the investigators always use strict evidence-based methodologies that follow accepted standards for developing CPGs [15]. Since 2004, the World Health Organization Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WHO/WPRO) has been in the process of developing international CPG for the use of traditional medicines [16]. Then, increasing CPGs for integration of CM and biomedicine (hereinafter referred to as CPGs for integration) have been developed in China [17], [18]. The quality of these CPGs has remained suboptimal according to Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II Instrument evaluation [19], [20], discussion of optimal integration therapy in CPGs has to remain open. Shortcomings in the guidelines process include the lack of 1) a special plan for CPG production, dissemination and implementation; 2) and a dedicated process to assess the needs of target users, answer specific questions such as possible herbs-drugs interactions, and the time of taking the herbs and ingesting the other drug or substances. To address these issues, our research group has committed to develop a new formal process for CPG of integration with the aid of interdisciplinary teams and experts. The present document summarises the main elements concepts of the guideline development methodology and key steps. It is anticipated that this progress will have a significant impact on the quality of care and clinical outcomes of individuals undergo integration treatment.",

The methodologies developed by medical associations were also incorporated. In addition, the current situation and limitations of CPGs for CM/integration therapies were systemically analyzed, and the results were showed in our previous research [26], [27]. Based on these works, a process including 3 basic stages was designed, including the preparation stage, the development stage and the finalization stage. Multiple methods were integrated into the process to cover the limitations of the current development of CPG for the integration of Chinese medicine and biomedicine. The flowchart of whole process is shown in Fig. 1\n.",

In the last ten years, scientific verification and applications beyond prescriptions have begun to be explored. It is possible to predict when herb/drugs interact by knowing their properties. For our purpose, research on predicting the herb-drug interaction with bioinformatics approaches will be conducted. A list of herb-drug combinations generated from the text mining process, literature evidence and expert\u2019s consensus will be used as candidates for evaluating their interaction effect by a systems pharmacology approach [28] including structure-, omics- and network-based systematic investigations. Mapping between the pharmacology network of herb-drug combination candidate and molecular network of a given disease will be conducted by using graph merge tool to calculate the efficacy index of the network. Centrality value distribution of best interaction between herbs and dugs in specific disease network, and on-target and off-target of intersection can be clearly presented.

            "text": "An investigation which evaluated eleven CM/integration treatment CPGs suggested that most of CPGs did not clearly describe how the CPGs had been developed and in some of CPGs the key steps were missing. Lack of appropriate process leads low adherence to the general process in development of these CPG. In this progress, we incorporated many widely adopted tools such as AGREE into the CPG development process. These tools could improve the quality and validity of CPGs, and facilitate subsequent implementation efforts. Insufficient evidence is another problem in CM CPG [10] and it is become more outstanding in CPG for integration of Chinese medicine and biomedicine of CM and biomedicine [7], [8]. In addition to establishing an improved CPG development process through traditional tools, we have prioritized the development of CPGs through new methods. Accordingly, we have proposed a new process of CPG for integration of Chinese medicine and biomedicine with two methods, to proceed as follows:1Prediction of the drug-herb interaction with a bioinformatics approach. This method is dependent on information extracted from published validation data to obtain the interaction between the combinational herb-drug candidates in the disease. Historically, herbs and drugs have been two very different treatment modalities which have rarely, if ever, been used together. The line that separates herbs and drugs, however, has been blurred in recent decades with the increased accessibility to the lay public. It is not uncommon for one patient to take multiple drugs and herbs concurrently. It becomes very difficult to predict whether the combination of drugs-herbs will lead to unwanted side-effects and/or interactions. It is imprudent to assume that there will be no interactions in CPGs for integration. And, it is just as unwise to abandon integration treatment simply for the fear of possible interactions. The solution to this situation is in the understanding of drugs-herbs interactions. With understanding of these mechanisms with systems pharmacology approaches, one can recognize potential interactions and take proper actions to prevent their occurrence. The results of prediction process will be used as a kind of supporting data resource for developing CPG for integration of Chinese medicine and biomedicine.2Text mining method. Text mining has been widely used in medical research and been introduced into CM research for quickly identified potential information. The aim of text mining method is used for collecting high frequency Zheng classifications, herb-drug combinations and CPMs reported in clinical studies, which imply that they are well known by practitioners in some extant. We consider this high frequency information as a kind of supporting date for forming CPGs for integration of CM and biomedicine.\n",
