Its origin can be found in the early 20th century when it was introduced to study tissue growth and maturation, virus biology and vaccine development, the role of genes in disease and health, and the use of large-scale hybrid cell lines to generate biopharmaceuticals. The experimental applications of cultured cells are as diverse as the cell types that can be grown in vitro. In a clinical context, however, cell culture is most commonly linked to creating model systems that study basic cell biology, replicate disease mechanisms, or investigate the toxicity of novel drug compounds. One of the advantages of using cell culture for these applications is the feasibility to manipulate genes and molecular pathways. Furthermore, the homogeneity of clonal cell populations or specific cell types and well-defined culture systems removes interfering genetic or environmental variables, and therefore allows for data generation of high reproducibility and consistency that cannot be warranted when studying whole organ systems.",

It advises on hazards and risks to workers and others from exposure to pathogens and has published these recommendations [1]. Since some cell types are pathogenic or carry disease-causing agents, it is important to first determine their Hazard Group and implement appropriate safety measures. This includes a written risk assessment and review of the laboratory facilities. Microorganisms classified as Hazard Group 1 (e.g., Escherichia coli K-12) or 2 (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus) represent a low or moderate health risk to laboratory workers and the community, and relies on effective prophylaxis or treatment options. Cell culture work with biological agents of Hazard Group 3 (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV)), and 4 (e.g., Ebola viruses) involves biological agents that carry high health risks and may lack treatment options upon infection. Thus, laboratory spaces need to provide containment levels corresponding to the Hazard Group of the cultured cell types. These are referred to as biosafety levels (BSL) and carry the corresponding numbers (BSL1\u20134). As such, laboratories designated as BSL1 will follow standard microbiological practices, while BSL2 laboratories will need to be restricted to trained personnel, who are taught to take extreme precaution handling sharp items and to limit infectious aerosols by utilizing physical containment equipment as well as Class II biosafety cabinets.",

The biosafety cabinet should be located in a laboratory space that does not interrupt its airflow through external sources of wind (e.g., drafts from windows or doors). Most biosafety cabinets require a warm-up time after which the work surface should be decontaminated with an antifungal detergent (e.g., 5% Trigene) followed by 70% ethanol. All equipment entering the biosafety cabinet also needs to be sprayed and wiped with 70% ethanol. The number of items used in the biosafety cabinet, however, should be kept at a minimum to avoid any obstruction of airflow. The biosafety cabinet should only be turned off after its daily use has been completed and the ultraviolet lamp may be turned on to sterilize the exposed surface areas over night. Regular maintenance also includes cleaning of the area under the work surface onto which media may spill through the grill. Furthermore, routine servicing through biosafety cabinet engineers can ensure correct airflow and full filter capacity of this important piece of cell culture equipment.",

The filter-sterilization of liquids can be achieved by forcing the liquid through a 0.22 \u03bcM polyethersulfone low-binding filter system using a vacuum pump. The addition of antibiotics (e.g., Penicillin/Streptomycin) further limits the risk of bacterial growth in media bottles after opening and in cell culture vessels.

While the latter property allows for ready detection in cell culture supernatants shortly after infection, it also facilitates quick spread. Cell cultures affected by bacterial contamination generally appear turbid in appearance. Furthermore, the high metabolic rates of bacteria can modify the pH of the culture media and thus change the color of phenol red to yellow. While bacteria may be detected as small particles at low microscope magnification, their distinct shapes are generally detected at higher magnification. While bacterial strains such as E. coli can therefore be uncovered quite easily due to their size (~2 \u03bcM) and flagella-induced mobility, other strains such as Mycoplasma are smaller in size (<1 \u03bcM), immobile, and therefore not as easily detectable. As a result, Mycoplasma infections can go unnoticed for a longer time and usually only become apparent through declining quality of the cultured cells. This can manifest as reduced cell proliferation and cell death. In order to monitor cell cultures for potential infections with Mycoplasma, it is advisable to routinely test cultures for their presence using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or immunostaining [2].\n",

The selected cell lines will also need to align with the available equipments and requirements of their specific hazard group. Cells cultured in the lab can be classified into three different types: primary cells, transformed cells, and self-renewing cells. Primary cells, such as fibroblasts obtained from skin biopsies and hepatocytes isolated from liver explants, are directly isolated from human tissue. Biomedical and translational research oftentimes relies on using these cell types since they are good representatives of their tissue of origin. However, there are stringent biosafety restrictions associated with handling these cell types. Furthermore, primary cells are generally characterized as \u201cfinite\u201d and therefore rely on a continuous supply of stocks since their proliferation ceases after a limited amount of cell divisions and cell expansion is oftentimes impossible. Transformed cells can be generated either naturally or by genetic manipulation. While the use of such immortalized cell lines leads to a cellular platform that generates fast growth rates and stable conditions for maintenance and cloning, their manipulated genotype may result in karyotypic abnormalities and nonphysiological phenotypes. On the other hand, standardized cell lines derived from human or nonhuman species or (e.g., Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), HeLa, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)) are oftentimes thoroughly characterized and may therefore be easier to set-up. Self-renewing cells include, for example, embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, neural and intestinal stem cells. These cells carry the capacity to differentiate into a diversity of other cells types, while their self-renewing property allows for long-term maintenance in vitro. Self-renewing cell types oftentimes act as physiologically relevant representatives of in vivo mechanisms.",

Serum provides cells with growth factors and hormones and acts as a carrier for lipids and enzymes, and the transportation of micronutrients and trace elements. Several labs, however, aim to reduce the supplementation of basal media with animal-derived factors such as serum since it is an undefined component that can highly vary between batches. It is also a costly cell culture product, carries the risk of causing undesired stimulatory or inhibitory effects on cellular growth and function, and may introduce contaminations if not sourced from reliable suppliers.

Since the pH level is dependent on the balance of CO2 and HCO3\n\u2212 (bicarbonate), the addition of bicarbonate-based buffers to cell culture media can equilibrate the CO2 concentrations.

Many cell culture media contain pH indicators (e.g., phenol red), which display a color range between acidic (yellow) and alkaline (pink) conditions. Furthermore, fluctuations in atmospheric CO2 concentrations can also alter the pH level. Cells should therefore be cultured in incubators that also allow for CO2 tensions to be adjusted to 5\u20137%.

In order to expand and/or maintain a healthy cell culture, it is therefore essential to produce a new culture with a subset of cells from the originating culture, removing toxic by-products, and replenishing nutrients with fresh medium. A suitable time for passaging is reached when the growth of adherent cells reaches ~80 % confluency. They can then be enzymatically digested or mechanically dissociated to lift off their substrate. In a biosafety cabinet, cells are washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) free of Mg2+ and Ca2+ to remove dead cells and are incubated at 37\u00b0C with sufficient digestive enzymes or chelating agent to cover the monolayer (e.g., trypsin, dispase, collagenase, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)). The time required to detach the anchored cells from their substrate and cell\u2013cell interactions can take 1\u201360 minutes and depends on the cell type and the digestive enzymes used. The extent of dissociation can be monitored under a light microscope and once complete, tapping of the culture vessel should dislodge remaining adherent cells. The dissociated cells are collected in a sterile Falcon tube and the culture vessel should also be washed with a medium containing an inhibitor for the enzymatic digestion and dissociation of cells. Collected cells can then be concentrated and counted according to protocols 4.3 and 4.4 and seeded in new culture vessels at the desired concentrations. Lower cell concentrations (~104 cells/mL) are suitable for cell lines with fast proliferation rates, while higher cell concentrations (~105 cells/mL) are more adapted for cells with slower growth rates.Note: It is good lab practice to record the number of passages that have taken place since the culture has been initiated. Some cell lines are not suitable for experimental work beyond a given passage number since chromosomal abnormalities tend to increase in mammalian lines with cell divisions over time.\n",

When relying on a specific concentration of live cells to start a culture or needing a specific number of live cells for an assay it is important to distinguish between live and dead cells. Cell counting is also helpful when assessing growth rates. Since cells are commonly cultured in the millions, the number of cells are first counted in a small volume and then extrapolated to the full cell volume. To achieve this, all cells are dissociated, pelleted, and evenly resuspended in a suitable medium volume. In a 1:1 dilution with 0.4% trypan Blue, a small volume of the cell suspension is mixed in an Eppendorf tube. Trypan Blue dye permeates only nonviable cells that can therefore be excluded from the subsequent quantification [6]. This occurs by loading 10 \u03bcL of the cell mixture in Trypan Blue onto a hemacytometer (Fig. 9.4\n). Using an inverted microscope, phase contrast, and a magnification of at least 10X, all cells located in the four outer squares are counted. Viable cells contain a darker \u201chalo,\u201d while nonviable cells stain blue/black. To determine the total number of viable cells, the number of cells found in all four squares is divided by 4 (to determine the average cell number in 1 mm2), multiplied by 104 (to obtain the cell number per mL), multiplied by 2 (to account for the dilution factor of Trypan Blue) and multiplied by the initial medium volume of the entire cell suspension. The percentage of viable cells can be determined by dividing the number of unstained cells by the total number of cells, and multiplying the ratio by 100. A healthy cell culture is characterized by 80\u201395% cell viability.\n",

The vial is wiped with 70% ethanol and placed in a biosafety cabinet where 1 mL of the prewarmed medium is added in a drop-wise fashion to the partially thawed vial to minimize the osmotic stress imposed upon the cells when DMSO is diluted. The contents of the now completely thawed vial are transferred also in a drop-wise fashion to the remaining 9 mL of complete medium and centrifuged at 300 \u00d7 g for 3 minutes.

Primary fibroblast cultures will emerge from the skin tissue after 2\u20133 days. Upon reaching ~80% confluency, the outgrown primary fibroblasts can be isolated from the skin tissue using enzymatic digestion with collagenase and subcultured in new vessels. This generates a pure population of fibroblasts, which can be scaled-up and virally transduced to express pluripotent genes (e.g., OCT4, NANOG, TRA-1-60), thereby \u201creprogramming\u201d somatic cells to become hIPSCs [8]. hIPSCs in culture will pack together tightly in flat colonies with sharp edges and are characterized by their high nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio, ability to self-renew, and capacity to form cells of all three germ layers. As such, hIPSCs can be differentiated toward definitive endoderm using Wnt pathway activation and Activin A. Cells at this stage of differentiation will migrate from their colonies into a monolayer, downregulate their pluripotency genes and express markers of their endoderm fate (e.g., SOX17, CXCR4, GSC). Further changes in the media composition and exogenous growth factors added to the definitive endoderm cells will direct them toward foregut endoderm and subsequent specification to hepatic endoderm. The final stage of the hepatic differentiation medium yields hepatocyte-like cells that secrete albumin and other serum proteins, take up low-density lipoprotein (LDL), store glycogen, and metabolize drugs. Importantly, these cells will also display the disease phenotypes observed in the patient from which the skin biopsy was initially obtained. While this process allows researchers to study and rescue disease mechanisms ex vivo [9], it also sheds light on liver development and the emergence of disease in utero.\n",
