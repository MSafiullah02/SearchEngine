The specific coronavirus strain was initially referred to as 2019-nCoV (2019 novel coronavirus) and finally designated as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). It was first identified in late 2019 in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province of China, and it rapidly spread throughout other Eastern countries (e.g. South Korea, Japan, Iran) as well as Europe and the United States [1] . On March 2020, the WHO (World Health Organization) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic and all countries were urged to undertake effective measures for reducing transmission [2] .",

Nevertheless, repeated exposure to these substances can lead to chronic cumulative ICD (Figure 1) , mainly due to their capacity to remove skin surface lipids, damage skin proteins, denature epidermal keratin, and even induce alteration of the cell membrane of keratinocytes [5] . Furthermore, patients with a personal or family history of atopic dermatitis have a chronically dysfunctional cutaneous barrier that increases their sensitivity to skin irritants ( Figure 2 ) [6] . Rarely, some individuals may even develop ACD (Figure 3) , a T-cell-mediated, delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, to an ingredient in a hand hygiene-related product, such as soaps or detergents [7] . The patient initiated preventive hand washing measures two months ago, without hydrating the hands afterward and developed severe skin dryness, fissuring (white arrow), and scaling. Also the irritant-induced changes have progressed to hyperkeratosis and acanthosis (black arrows), highlighting the cumulative exposure.",
