Causing excessive morbidity in human populations across the world, URTI resulted in an estimated 84 million consultations in the United States during one year alone [2]. The financial costs top US$40 billion, just over half in indirect costs, with 40\u2013100 million school and work days lost to absenteeism each year [3]. There are no effective anti-viral therapies for most URTIs yet Americans spend US$2.9 billion a year on over the counter cold remedies. Although generally self limiting, symptoms of cough often persist up to 3 weeks following viral infection [4]. Additionally a subgroup of patients can develop a chronic cough with symptoms being more prolonged and lasting months or years.",

In children 85% of exacerbations were associated with a virus [8] and 75% of exacerbations in adults [9]. Rhinoviruses are consistently the most frequent virus types detected, found in around two-thirds of cases where a virus is identified. The exact mechanism through which virus infection triggers exacerbations of airway disease is still unclear, but is likely to represent a constellation of host immune responses and specific viral actions. Infection of respiratory epithelium leads to a cascade of pro-inflammatory cytokines which recruit and activate immune cells in the airway. Mucus hyper-secretion following virus infection is likely to be a key factor in airway obstruction and cough in the aetiology of airway disease exacerbations [10].",

Healthy individuals frequently develop URTI during early autumn associated with an increased incidence of cough and presentations to medical services. Epidemiological studies demonstrate the striking impact of seasonal factors on exacerbation frequencies in both asthma and COPD [17]. Asthma exacerbations in children peak around mid to late September strongly correlating with return to school [17]. A peak in COPD exacerbations follows in December which is associated with the Christmas holiday season and is seen in every northern hemisphere country studied [17]. These trends reflect a complex combination of many causative factors; but the primary cause of exacerbations is respiratory virus infection particularly with rhinovirus. Peak asthma exacerbations correlate with the highest incidence of rhinovirus infections in the community but the reason for the delay in COPD exacerbations is not clear [8], [15], [17].",

Viruses, such as influenza, may be highly pathogenic and cause excessive epithelial cell necrosis and inflammation.

A virus infected epithelial cell releases a wide range of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 IL-8, GRO-\u03b1, IL-11, RANTES, GM-CSF and eotaxin. In addition the expression of growth factors, adhesion molecules and immunity related molecules is up-regulated by virus infection [19]. A recent longitudinal study of exacerbations in severe asthmatics identified increases in IL-13 and IFN-\u03b3 producing T-cells during exacerbations; the deficiency of regulatory T cells found at baseline was also exaggerated during exacerbations [20].

Substance P was found to be elevated in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from RSV infected mice [21] and this has been implicated in the lymphocytic response [22]. Further study in RSV infected mice again found elevated substance P levels, but also falls in the airway protective compound calcitonin gene-related peptide CGRP [23]. CGRP, a neuropeptide with vasodilating effects, is constitutively found in the airway and when deficient airways were found to be inflamed and hyper-responsive [24]. The central role of substance P in virus induced airway dysfunction was confirmed when it was shown that selective blocking of the substance P receptor, neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor with Sendide abolished AHR [23].",

A rat study using RSV demonstrated significantly higher levels of substance P in lung tissue following infection; additionally stimulation with capsaicin further increased substance P release in infected lungs compared to controls [27]. Work in guinea pigs confirmed the high potency of substance P in cough generation and the effect of NE to limit this [28]. By inactivating cough generating tachykinins, NEs limit cough activity. Exogenous inhibitors of NE were able to increase the sensitivity to substance P with an increase in cough frequency and a lower dose response curve to capsaicin induced cough in guinea pigs [28].",

This effect was attenuated following addition of an NF-\u03baB and mitogen activated protein (MAP)-kinase inhibitor, suggesting these signalling molecules are important for mucus hyper-secretion following virus infection and suggesting inhibitors of these as potential therapeutic targets. In vivo rhinovirus infection has been shown to induce MUC5AC levels in BAL and in vitro studies demonstrated that this occurs as a result of new mRNA synthesis. The signalling pathway has been characterised in detail and the transcription factors NF-\u03baB and SP-1 were shown to be involved. Following RV infection NF-\u03baB is activated and matrix metalloproteinase mediated release of transforming growth factor (TGF) occurs. This in turn activates the epidermal growth factor receptor leading to activation of protein kinase signalling (MAPK, MEK and ERK). Finally through SP-1 signalling the MUC5AC gene transcription is increased and hence protein levels elevated [37] (C.A. Hewson et al., unpublished results).",

Major group rhinoviruses (90% of serotypes) bind to the human intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) as their cellular receptor. However they are unable to bind to mouse ICAM-1. The recent generation of a mouse-human ICAM-1 chimera has enabled a mouse model of rhinovirus infection to be created [39]. In addition the model included sensitisation and subsequent re-challenge with ovalbumen to create features of atopy, which in combination with rhinovirus infection provides a model for asthma exacerbations. In the absence of coughing in mice AHR would have to be used as surrogate for cough, however guinea pigs, which are able to cough, may prove a more useful model in the future. Sendai and RSV infection are established in guinea pigs but RV infection has not presently been attempted. The availability of a small animal model will prove invaluable in the development of therapies for cough.",

Therefore more objective assessments of cough monitoring have been developed. In these, sound from coughing is recorded digitally and numbers of individual coughs and time spent coughing are calculated by investigators. The system has been validated by correlation with video recordings and has been shown to be responsive to symptom changes following use in cystic fibrosis patients [43]. Objective monitoring of cough in stable COPD has been performed [44]; here it was shown that cough was more frequent during the day and did not correlate with lung function tests. Many different systems to measure cough have been developed for both research and commercial purposes. In addition to the system detailed above at least two other groups in the UK have developed cough monitoring systems [45], [46]. Only moderate correlation with subjective scoring was observed. The opportunity to combine objective monitoring with experimental rhinovirus infection would provide a unique opportunity to study cough in controlled and well-defined populations; both those with and without airways disease. Both COPD and asthma exacerbations could be studied which would provide data of the duration and severity of cough following viral infection. Not only would this facilitate investigation of the mechanisms of cough but also provide the opportunity to test potential therapies.",

The antiviral ruprintrivir was used in experimental RV colds and reduced the mean daily symptom score when given 24 hours after infection. Prophylactic use reduced the viral load but did not reduce the frequency of colds [52]. A review of RV chemotherapy concluded that effective drugs were available but studying these in trials and their use clinically are difficult as almost immediate diagnosis and treatment of virus infection is required [53]. Ribavirin is an effective antiviral for RSV, but larger clinical studies have lacked the power to demonstrate a benefit in bronchiolitis, although there is conflicting evidence in the literature [54], [55], [56] and it has not been specifically shown to reduce cough symptoms. Centrally acting cough suppressors are not specific to virus induced cough and are generally avoided because of their side effect profile. A double blind placebo controlled study using both objective and subjective cough monitoring found very little support for conventional antitussives over placebo in an URTI associated cough [57]. Alternative therapies may be developed in the future, but these will need to have minimal side effects and a rapid onset of action if there are to be of use in URTI and control of cough.",
