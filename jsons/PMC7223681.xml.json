            "text": "Nanomaterials with its awe-inspiring nanostructures have revamped the medical field owing to their plethora of inherent functional properties [1]. Among the various nanomaterials, nanoparticles have revolutionized modern therapeutics owing to their high specific surface area and inherent photocatalytic, optical, structural, mechanical, and magnetic properties in addition to their efficacy in permeability and retention. Further, unique features for drug delivery, diagnosis and imaging, synthetic vaccine development, and medical devices give promising hope for cancer. Cancer, a global life-threatening pathology, is scientifically defined as an uncontrolled proliferation and spread of abnormal cells. Tremendous efforts are being made in understanding its pathogenesis and developing drugs to combat cancer. In spite of enormous research, the high incidence rate and rapid recurrence make cancer a more challenging disease. Among other types, the prevalence of skin cancer is rapidly increasing due to cumulative exposure to adverse UV rays [2, 3]. Although skin cancer does not have any significant mortality rate, it is among the most commonly reported cancers all over the world. There are diverse types of skin cancers like basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Melanoma cancers, in particular, have tendency to metastasize through regional lymph nodes to distant organs such as liver, lungs, and bone, and if metastasized, the probability of 5-year survival rate from diagnosis is reported to be decreased by 80% [4]. The present treatment strategies for skin cancer like radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery are plagued with side effects and unwarranted recurrences. Nanotechnology-based targeted drug delivery and therapeutic applications including diagnostic sensors and radiation therapy are in vogue [5]. Nanoparticles, nanofibers, etc. have been used to deliver a variety of biomolecules and drugs to their target site [3\u20137]. In certain cases, the drugs themselves are also made into nanoparticles and are targeted to the required site [7]. The nanotechnological applications are widely used due to their high surface area to encapsulate the drug and extremely small size for easy penetration into the cell membrane [8]. Several reports on nanoparticles and its anti-cancer activity are available, but a lacuna is still present in developing an efficient mode of transport to carry the drug with minimal wastage and side effects arising due to unwanted drug leaching. Metal nanoparticles or metal oxide nanoparticles [9] such as Au [10], TiO2 [11], ZnO [12], CeO2 [13], and FeO [14] hold an important position in cancer therapeutics for their potential toxicity against cancer cells. They serve a major role in photothermal therapy and also help in targeting radiation towards the cancer cells [15]. Molybdenum, an essential trace element, serves as a cofactor for various enzymes such as xanthine dehydrogenase, aldehyde oxidase, sulfite oxidase, and nitrate reductase [16]. The permissible amount of molybdenum in circulation is 2 mg/day and complexes of molybdenum have also shown an anti-diabetic activity [17]. Molybdenum oxide has a strong localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) absorption in the near infrared region, which would enable them to play a major role in photothermal therapy for ablation of cancer cells [18]. Molybdenum oxide serves as a cheaper alternate for noble metals and has vital applications in cancer therapeutics. In nanoscale, its oxide form is non-toxic and safe when compared with other metal oxides [19]. Molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) nanoparticles are reported to have an anti-microbial activity at minimal levels against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by activating membrane stress in the pathogen [20, 21]. Recently, these metal oxide nanoparticles are reported to induce significant toxicity towards invasive breast cancer cell lines. This paper essentially deals with unearthing the inherent potential of molybdenum oxide nanoparticles exhibiting selective cytotoxicity towards cancer cells through mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathway.",

The increasing ROS generation in a cellular system increases the oxidative damage to the cellular components and thereby pushes the cells to an apoptotic state [26]. Hence, the involvement of MoO3 in ROS production is tested using a molecular probe DCFH-DA. DCFH-DA is a molecular probe that is permeable through the plasma membrane. This gets oxidized into DCF which emits fluorescence by the intracellular ROS that is present. Thereby, the greater the fluorescence is, the greater is the ROS present internally. Figure 7 shows the phase contrast and fluorescent microscopic images of control A431 cells and cells treated with IC50 concentration of MoO3 nanoparticles. The presence of DCF is more prominent in the nanoparticle-treated cell lines. This concludes that the ROS generation was significantly higher in the A431 cells treated with MoO3.

The mitochondrial membrane potential dropped drastically in the MoO3-treated cells, which caused the dye to exhibit itself in monomeric state.

During apoptosis, the cells exchange their peripheral phospholipid, i.e., phosphatidyl serine (PS), from the inner side of the cell membrane to the outer side exposing it to the extracellular space. Annexin V is a 35-kDa Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding protein which binds with PS but is incapable of entering the lipid bilayer (plasma membrane) when the cell is alive but when the cell is undergoing apoptosis, due to the flipping of PS from the inner side of the plasma membrane to the outer space causes interaction between Annexin (V) and PS. Annexin (V) is attached to the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), an indicator for cells attached to Annexin (V) [28]. When the cells are stained with Annexin V-FITC and PI, they are subjected to falling: in the first quadrant are unstained cells, the second quadrant are early apoptotic cells (they are stained only by Annexin V-FITC), the third quadrant are late apoptotic cells (they are stained by Annexin V-FITC and PI, as their cell membrane and nuclear membrane are also compromised due to apoptosis), and the fourth quadrant are necrotic cells (the cells only stained with PI due to the loss of their cell membrane). Figure 9 shows the flow cytometry results of cells treated with IC50 concentration of MoO3 nanoparticle. Since the MoO3 nanoparticle was incubated for 16 h, the cells have reached an early apoptotic stage. As the incubation time increases, the cells will go to late apoptotic stage and then cell death. This quantitates the number of cells that undergo apoptosis after treating with MoO3 nanoparticles.",

It is evident from Fig. 10a that there is an increase in the expression of BAX genes and a decrease in Bcl2 genes after treatment of A431 cell lines with MoO3. The increase in the apoptotic protein and the decrease in the anti-apoptotic protein destabilize the mitochondrial membrane which in turn pushes the cell into apoptotic phase (Table 4). The corresponding protein expression also confirmed that the cell is entering apoptotic phase by activating the BAX-Bcl2 pathway and represented in Fig. 10b.",

Angiogenesis plays a major role in growth and development of any tumor. In addition, it also forms a pathway for the tumor cells to travel to various organs and establish the tumor microenvironment. Hence, a molecule which kills cancer cells and also inhibits angiogenesis would serve as an ideal anti-cancer drug. Molybdenum salts are said to have anti-angiogenic properties in nature [29]. Molybdenum ions serve as an excellent chelating agent for copper, a cofactor for enzymes supporting angiogenesis [30]. Cu ions are also known to support proliferation and migration of endothelial cells [31]. Thus, the anti-cancer nature of MoO3 nanoparticles was tested using various in vitro and in ovo experiments.",

The cancer cell thereby secretes a lot of cytokines that help in angiogenesis. Hence, a molecule that prevents the migration of endothelial cells and prevents angiogenesis can inhibit cancer prognosis. The ability of MoO3 to hinder angiogenesis was tested using endothelial cell migration [32]. A wound created on the plate of EA.hy926 cells was treated with IC50 concentration of MoO3 nanoparticles and the migration of the cells to cover the wounded area was sequentially photographed using a light microscope at regular time intervals. From Fig. 11, it is evident that the wound created on the control EA.hy926 cells was almost closed at the end of the eighth hour, whereas the wound treated with the MoO3 nanoparticles prevented the closure of the abrasion, by inhibiting the migration of EA.hy926 cells. It could be seen from Fig. 11 that the EA.hy926 cells did not die but stopped migrating. This experiment proves that MoO3 nanoparticles in addition to anti-cancer properties obstruct the migration of endothelial cells, restraining the development of nutritious blood vessels to the tumor tissue.",

Whereas the membranes treated with MoO3 did not show any development or thickening of vessels [28]. The control samples showed an increase in the capillaries after 24 h. These capillaries thickened uniformly into prominent blood vessels after 72 h. In the CAM cultured with MoO3 nanoparticles, there was no significant increase in the capillaries.
