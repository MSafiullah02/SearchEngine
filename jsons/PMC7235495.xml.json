ACE2, by forming angiotensin\u2010(1\u20107) from angiotensin II, could diminish the deleterious effects of angiotensin II and, consequently, it is also possible that ACE inhibitors or ARBs could, in fact, lower the risk of complications.\n51\n However, increased ACE2 and the formation of angiotensin\u2010(1\u20107), by inhibiting COX\u20102, could exert anti\u2010inflammatory effects,\n52\n, \n53\n underscoring the multitude of possible effects and the need to conduct studies to interrogate these connections. Finally, it is not known whether an increase in the expression of ACE2 would also lead to an increased shedding and increased levels of soluble ACE2, which could act as a decoy receptor and lower viral entry into cells.\n54\n In support of this, recombinant human ACE2 ameliorated the lung injury induced by the avian influenza H5N1 virus in mice.\n55\n It is also important to consider that from the relatively limited amount of human data, plasma ACE2 activity does not appear to be statistically different between individuals taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs and those not taking these medications, but these results do not reflect the levels of cellular receptors.\n56\n Structural analyses indicate that the binding of the SARS\u2010CoV spike protein to ACE2 does not occlude the catalytically active site of the receptor,\n26\n, \n57\n and it was hypothesised that angiotensin II binding to ACE2 could induce a conformational change in the receptor, which will no longer be favourable for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 binding.\n54\n The mining of existing datasets, preclinical studies and clinical trials will help shed light on these complex and sometimes conflicting scenarios.",

For any infectious disease, the incubation period varies among individuals, even for the same outbreak, and depends on the initial infective dose, the speed of pathogen replication within a host and host defence mechanisms.\n80\n During the 2002\u20102003 SARS outbreak, a study in Hong Kong revealed that patients with shorter incubation times developed more severe disease.\n81\n The same was found in MERS patients from South Korea, where longer incubation times were associated with a lower risk of death.\n82\n Interestingly, during the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, healthcare workers, who have a higher infecting dose, had 34% shorter median incubation times than non\u2010healthcare workers.\n83\n It will be interesting to examine whether the same is true for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, and whether the incubation period is different in COVID\u201019 patients when they are stratified by age, coexisting morbidities and therapies they receive for chronic diseases.

In one instance, a patient continued to have detectable respiratory shedding, as shown by PCR, for eight consecutive days after becoming asymptomatic.\n90\n Another study revealed that several children with COVID\u201019 persistently tested positive for viral RNA on faecal swabs after their nasopharyngeal cultures became negative. Even though replication\u2010competent virus was not detected in the faecal swabs, this finding leaves open the possibility of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 faecal\u2010oral transmission.\n91\n These findings illustrate the challenges in understanding SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 transmission and in identifying infected individuals, tracing their contacts and implementing preparedness plans. One of the absolute requirements, to clarify these questions and overcome these obstacles, is ensuring the prompt and large\u2010scale testing of symptomatic individuals and of their asymptomatic contacts.
