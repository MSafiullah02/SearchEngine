COPD severity was defined according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) classification [19]. None of the patients were treated with neo-adjuvants chemotherapy. Lung tissue of patients diagnosed with solitary pulmonary tumor was obtained at a maximum distance from the pulmonary lesions and without signs of retro-obstructive pneumonia or tumor invasion and collected by a pathologist. Lung tissue of patients with COPD GOLD III-IV was obtained from lung explants of end-stage COPD patients undergoing lung transplantation. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. This study was approved by the medical ethical committees of the Ghent University Hospital (2011/114) and the University Hospital Gasthuisberg Leuven (S51577).

Exclusion criteria were a history of asthma, complaints of wheezing, recent respiratory tract infection, and recent or concurrent usage of anti-inflammatory drugs. Oral anti-inflammatory medication was discontinued for at least 3 months and inhaled glucocorticoids at least 6 weeks before the start of the study. Bronchoscopy was performed with an Olympus BF 1T10. At least 6 biopsies were taken from the bronchi of the right and the left upper and lower lobes using a fenestrated forceps (FB-18C or FB-20C). All was according to published guidelines [22].

The intensity of brown staining we wished to score was selected by means of selecting specific hue, lightness, and saturation values. The hue, saturation, and lightness values were identical for all images, therefore restricting our scoring to a specific signal. In every image the alveolar tissue was selected and the DPP4-positive signal was calculated only within the alveolar tissue and normalized to the area of alveolar tissue present in each image. The final score of each patient was the average ratio of DPP4-positive signal of the 15 images. In the airway epithelium, the amount of DPP4 signal was normalized to the length of the basement membrane (Pbm). The final score of each patient was the average DPP4 staining in all airways present in all tissue blocks available of that patient. The number of airways per patient was between 3 and 20.",

As previously reported, DPP4 is mainly detected in the alveolar epithelial cells of the lungs, the main target of MERS-CoV infection [13, 15]. Among the dendritic cells, we found that DPP4 mRNA is mainly expressed in pDCs; confirming in vitro data showing that among the antigen presenting cells, pDCs produce large amounts of type I and III interferon upon contact with MERS-CoV [14]. Most importantly, we provide evidence that DPP4 is upregulated in the lungs, both at mRNA and protein level, not only in COPD patients but also in that of smokers. This indicates that these individuals may be more susceptible to MERS-CoV, supporting both smoking and COPD as risk factors for MERS-CoV infection [18]. These results are in line with a recent study describing a higher DPP4 expression in lungs of 4 COPD patients compared to 16 control subjects of different ages [13].",

Future studies are needed to assess whether DPP4 upregulation is specific for the alveolar epithelial cells or also occurs in the upper respiratory tract epithelium.

These data suggest a possible role of DPP4 in COPD pathogenesis. DPP4 is an exopeptidase responsible for cleaving chemokines and this alters the biological function. Moreover, DPP4 is able to activate T cells and induce production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which later could affect the development of COPD [20, 31\u201333]. Furthermore, DPP4 is also capable of influencing migration of immune cells by activating or deactivating chemokines in an inflammatory or tumor environment [10, 11]. Interestingly, soluble DPP4 in the serum of COPD patients has been reported to be significantly lower compared to that of non-COPD controls [34, 35]. It remains possible that in COPD patients, DPP4 concentration is low in the serum and high in the lungs to facilitate migration of certain immune cells into or out of the lungs.",

A possible limitation of our study might be the sex imbalance in the groups with, respectively, a male predominance in the COPD groups and a female predominance in the never-smokers. However, it should be noted that linear regression analyses indicated that sex does not significantly contribute to the differences in expression of membrane-bound DPP4. Our data are in line with recent analyses of soluble DPP4 in serum in patients with COPD versus non-COPD controls indicating that there is no relationship between sex and DPP4 levels [35]. It is also important to acknowledge that there are other factors related to COPD that could contribute to the increased MERS-CoV susceptibility independent of DPP4. For instance, COPD patients are mostly in advanced age and more prone to many other pulmonary infections during hospitalization [36]. Besides that, COPD is associated with systemic inflammation, which might also cause insufficient host immune response against pathogens [20, 37].",
