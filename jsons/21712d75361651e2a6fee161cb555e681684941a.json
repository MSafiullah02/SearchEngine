Most epidemilogists believe that the disease has been caused by viruses, though all attempts to prove such a relationship have been fruitless. A common feature of most of the clues offered for elucidating the role of the viruses, is that they interfere with the epidemiological evidence on BN. Therefore, a hypothesis is put forward that the disease has been caused by slow viruses transmitted by rodents which contaminate food and articles in the house. Such an explanation fits most of the existing epidemiological data.",

Its main epidemiological features are: all foci are situated in the vicinity of the Danube or its tributaries, often in flooded areas; the disease has no tendency of spreading out of the known endemic foci; there is a very marked tendency of clustering of cases within families; immigrants may develop the disease if having spent a sufficient period of time in an endemic area (usually over 20 years); except for children which do not develop an overt disease, and the oldest age groups, the incidence of BN is proportional to age; both sexes have similar risk of dying from BN; the incidence of tumors of the kidney pelvis and ureters may be over 100 times higher in endemic than in neighbouring non-endemic villages; a high percentage of apparently healthy persons from endemic foci have an increase of urinary beta-2-microglobulin (1,2,3,4).",
