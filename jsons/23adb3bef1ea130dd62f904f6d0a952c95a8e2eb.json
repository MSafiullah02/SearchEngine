The main clinical manifestations include headache, ptosis, and restriction in eye movements with or without changes in the pupil. The MRA of patient was negative and the clinical manifestations were inconformity for aneurysm. Cerebrovascular disease involved infarction or bleeding of brainstem, pituitary apoplexy was excluded by MRI scan. Short course of disease and MRI scan also excluded brain tumor. Owing to the age of patient and MRI scan, the demy elination disease was not taken into account. The diabetes mellitus was well controlled with random blood glucose and hemoglobin A1C at normal range. Therefore, diabetic peripheral neuropathy was excluded. Some patients of GBS were associated with oculomotor nerve palsy. Nonetheless, the patient's tendon reflexes and sensation test were normal which were not in accord with GBS. Finally, infected disease was in accord with the patient. Patient's chest CT manifes tation and throat swab sample were positive for the 2019 nCoV.

            "text": "In December 2019, a large number of infected pneu monia cases suddenly appeared in Wuhan. The etiology of these infections was the 2019nCoV, possibly connected to zoonotic or environmental exposure from the Huanan sea food market in Wuhan. Human coronavirus is one of the main pathogens of respiratory infection. The two highly pathogenic viruses, SARS CoV and MERS CoV, cause severe respiratory syndrome in humans and four other human corona viruses (HCoV 229E, HCoV OC43, HCoV HKU1, and HCoV NL63) induce mild upper respiratory disease [6] . The sequence of 2019 nCoV is relatively different from the six other coronavirus subtypes but can be classified as betacoronavirus. The 2019nCoV uses the receptor, ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) to infect cells [7] . The process of infection generates high levels of angiotensin II (Ang II), which can lead to increases in vascular permeabil ity and pulmonary oedema, even often lethal lung failure in patients [8] . Owing to 2019nCoV infections, high amount of cytokines and corticosteroids was used frequently for treatment of patients with severe illness, for possible benefit by reducing inflammatoryinduced lung injury. Some stud ies reported that receiving corticosteroids treatment delayed viral clearance [9] [10] [11] . Therefore, according to WHO interim guidance, corticosteroids should not be routinely given sys temically [12] . According to the current data, the 2019 nCoV is a highly contagious virus with mortality 11-15% [3, 5] . This report describes a case involving an adult patient first onset of acute left oculomotor nerve palsy with 2019nCoV infected pneumonia that was identified based on chest CT findings and throat swab sample test. In this case, no clinical, laboratory, or imaging examinations showed any indication of an underlying structural cause of the oculomotor nerve injury, suggesting that the 2019nCoV infection might have caused the acute oculomotor nerve palsy in this case. Why focal neurological deficits may arise following 2019nCoV infections remains unclear. Pathological mechanisms, such as virus infection invasion or inflammatory factors accom panying the effects, are commonly suggested. On the other hand, the virus infection may directly damage the myelin sheaths and surrounding axons due to complications such as GBS, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, transverse myelitis, and optic neuritis. The hypothesis suggests that oculomotor nerve palsy could be triggered by the same mechanism. The 2019nCovinduced waterfall inflamma tion reaction led to respiratory failure and resulted in death. Unfortunately, cerebrospinal fluid examination was not examined. Although the MRI test was negative, whether the inflammatory factors invaded brainstem was unknown. To the best of my knowledge, the case was the first reported that the 2019nCoV infection resulted in oculomotor nerve palsy. It is possible that the same symptoms or signs may be observed with rare etiology.",
