In an increasing number of teaching centers the subspecialty is gaining recognition and support, and is thus prospering; but the majority of European pediatric institutions still lack highly educated personnel as well as specialized diagnostic and therapeutic facilities. There are many reasons for this. Basic structural differences in health care services and educaeducational programs between various countries, together with factors related to more fundamental differences between the peoples of the continent, often hamper the exchange of ideas and dissemination of expertise, which would be the prerequisite for the development of uniform professional standards.

As a rule, selective defects of pulmonary immune mechanisms will lead to infection if additional defects develop or coexist, e. g. IgG-subclass deficiencies in addition to IgA deficiency. Combined humoral immunedeficlencies predispose to recurrent o r chronic infections with purulent bacteria. In congenital T-cell deficiency viral, fungal, protozoal and mycobacterial organisms prevail. Immunodeficiencies following HIV, EEV or other viruses result in clinical syndromes resembling congenital immunedeficiency. In contrast, immunesuppression causes a wide spectrum of immunedysfunction depending on the treatment regimen. Most respiratory infections in such patients result from aspiration o r hematogeneous spread of endogenous organisms. Reactivation o f Herpes Virus o r Cytomegalovirus and acquisition of Measles, Legionella and Pneumocystis carinii are important other causes of infection. In contrast, Mumps, Rubella, Hepatitis 6 , EBV and Parainfluenza Type I, Polio, Echo and Coxsackie Viruses appear o f little significance in these patients. Analysis of several series of pulmonary infections in immunosuppressed children has shown Pneumocystis to be the most frequent organism followed by viruses, mixed infections, fungi and bacteria. This type o f analysis underestimates common bacteria whlch respond to the usual treatment regimens. All types of immunedeficiency are characterized by decreased inflammatory responses and accordingly by the absence o r by delayed appearance of radiological signs. Included are only patients with irreversible d a m 9 of bronchial walls shown by bronchography, CTscan, histology, or i n cases of known aetiology a persistent radiological changes and matched on isotope scanning.",

At all occasions nasopharyngeal swabs were taken for bacteriological cultures, and at all respiratory infections nasopharyngeal apirates were drawn for virological examination by rapid immunofluorescence and cell cultures. FI virus infection was diagnosed in 68 of 158 infections examined, 31 with wheezing. Possible positive bacterial culture findigs were found in 63 of 141 infections examined, and in 52 o f 139 control examinations (P>0.2). More postive bacterial culture findings were done in otitis media than in other infections (P<0.005), but not more often in infections with wheezing, and not in children with especially frequent wheezing and infections. Streotococcus pneumoniae and Haemoohilus influenzae were the bacteriae most often isolated. Positive bacterial culture findings did not occur more often in cases with positive virological findings (P>O.2). RS virus and parainfluenza virus infections were more often related to wheezing than were influenza virus and adenovirus. The most frequent viruses diagnosed were adenovirus and parainfluenza virus. The role of respiratory virus infections in small children with recurrent respiratory infections 1s well established. Apart from in o t i t i s media, bacterial infections seem to play a minor role, and the bacteriae isolated probably represent colonisation of the nasopharyngeal space in many cases.

Relaxation responses to 1-isoproterenol and forskoline of asthmatic and normal ASM were similar. EFS produced exaggerated cholinergic contractions followed by reduced NAI relaxations in asthmatic bronchi. In the presence of atropine, however, NAI responses of asthmatic bronchi were low, but fell within the 95% confidence limits of the control tissues' responses. Histological examination of asthmatic bronchi showed characteristic abnormalities, such as marked ASM hypertrophy and eosinophilic infiltration. The present observations suggest that ASX may contribute to BHR in asthma by an increased contractility, which may be related to ASM hypertrophy. AIM: To establish a met.hod to evaluate bronchial reaction in Histamine provocation test. with a minimal degree of cooperation from the patient. MATERIAL: 26 children with bronchial asthma (aged 6-15 yrs). PROVOCATION TEST: Nebulized buffered Histamine chloride was inhaled for 2 minute periods with stepwise increasing concentrations starting at 0.015 mg/ml. The total respiratory resistance ( R ) was evaluated with the forced oscillation technigue ( 4 H z ) . A resistance exceeding 150% of the preprovocation value was taken to indicate a significant bronchial reaction. Transcutaneous PO (t.c PO ) was monitored during the whole procedure with a Radiometer k M 2 monitor system. RESUILTS: When the respiratory resistance increased to 1505 o r above (mean 182%) there was a simultaneous significant decrease in transcut.aneous PO to a mean of 72% of the initla1 value.

Our studies were aimed at the development of a preparation with dicreased antigenic content due to a lesser number of killed particles. A preliminary experimental study was performed in various biological test systems; controlled clinical investigations were carried out in more than 400,000 newborns. The proposed preparation, i. e. BCG-R, is intended mainly for vaccination of newborns and high risk groups of children. BCG-R vaccine contains in one vaccinating dose of 0.025 mg 500,000 to 750,000 countable particles, while one vaccinating dose of the commercial vaccine equal to 0.05 mg contains 500,000 to 1,500 000 countable particles. The use of BCG-R allows to increase the coverage of infants with vaccination by 10-12% and to reduce the number of postvaccinal complications thrice. the development of new tuberculins with higher specificity for the vaccinated organism are also of great importance. The work in this direction was started in the USSR. Thus,PPD-BCG that was proposed as a substitute for PPD but proved to be unsuitable for this purpose is now successfully used for assessing the efficiency of BCG immunization. The use of PPD-BCG in a dose of 2 TU allows to reveal 30-35% more tuberculin positive persons.

A retrospective study on mycobacterial cervical adenitis among Finnish children in 1977-86 was performed to gain information on incidence, etiological mycobacteria and clinical data of the disease. The material was based on the tuberculosis register of the National Board of Health and on the records of the reference tuberculosis laboratory**. The number of cases registered in the 10 year period was 33, with 25 girls and 8 boys, which gave an incidence of the order of 0.3 cases / year / 100 000 children. Lymphadenopathy had mostly developed in connection with upper respiratory infection tonsillits or otitis, but when taken to examinations, the child ren lacked signs and symptoms of infection. In all cases, the diagnosis was based on histopathological changes typical of tuberculosis. Microbial cultures of the biopsy material were positive for mycobacteria in 40%. Atypical mycobacteria, predominantly M. avium-intracell ul are, outnumbered tuberculosis by 1 to 10 as etiological microbes. A wide local excision of the affected lymphnodes seemed to be the therapy of choice. Antituberculous drugs seemed to be of little value in treatment of atypical mycobacterial infections.",

Neonatal BCG vaccination seemed to protect children against atypical mycobacteria, especially at 1-4 years of age. A comparison to Swedish data on cervical adenitis due to atypical mycobacteria confirms this observation. The importance of atypical mycobacteria as etiological pathogens has to be recognised. Contrary to tuberculosis which always has to be treated with specific drugs, atypical mycobacterial infections need proper surgical excision of the affected lymph nodes, which preferably is performed in connection of the primary biopsy, and antituberculous drugs are needed only exceptionally. Studies evaluating adverse effects of oral T on learninglbehavior have been performed on children with asthma receiving chronic T therapy. To further differentiate the effects of asthma itself from the drugs used, we evaluated 20 asthmatic children (6-12 yrs) who had not received oral bronchodilators for at least 6 mo. A double blind, placebo(P) controlled, parallel format was used with a 4-week T or P period preceded by a 2-week baseline. T serum levels were maintained between 10-20 ug/ml. child's home and school behaviorlperformance were monitored independently by their parents and teachers using standardized report forms. A battery of psychological tests was administered at the end of baseline and treatment periods. All children receiving T were noted to have a change in school behavior/performance during their 4 weeks on drug compared to baseline, while none of the children receiving P were noted to be different (p=.004).

Measuring bronchial reactivity by cold air challenge(CACh) is the prerequisite for assessing the \"functional dimensions\" of childhood asthma. TWO girls with asthma, 1 0 and 1 4 years old, died suddenly in the winter 1 9 8 5 / 8 6 . Both had been classified by clinical criteria as moderately severe asthma, had given the impression o f a well-stabilized disease course, and h a d shown good compliance with regular antiasthmatic medication. By chance, bronchial reactivity had been assessed b y the above method and concept within the last 6 months before death in both cases. For comparative purposes, we then assessed the \"functional dimensions\" in 37 children with asthma o f the same clinical severity. Consequently, measurements from the two index cases can be compared to those from this group. Baseline lung function of the two girls was on t h e lowest end of the group spectrum: the \"functional optimum\", measured after bronchodilator medication, was also below average f o r both index cases. The \"functional minimum\", defined as that level of lung function measured at maximum reaction after CACh, was again in the lowest end of the group spectrum. The \"range of reactivity\", defined as the distance between optimum and minimum, was of average dimension. In addition t o lung function measurements, the children scored their subjective feeling of \"chest tightness\". A perception score, relating subjective perception and lung function impairment, was calculated. This score, applied for the situations of baseline lung function and post-CACh minimum, was markedly below average for both index cases. In summary both girls with later occuring sudden death demonstrated a h i g h degree of reactivity, only partial recovery of function after bronchodilator, and a markedly r e d w e d perception of bronchoconstriction. change in PEFR was greater on exercise (39% vs 33%, p<O.O5), bronchodilator (31% vs 26%, p<O.O2) and lability index (47% vs 381, p<O.O2) in the AED group. had worse \"worst ever\" attacks (34% blue v s 14% OPD, p<O.O5).",

For each subject we calculated the cough ratio as the ratio of maximum expiratory flow(MEF)(equivalent to that obtained in the FEV) to transient peak flow obtained during coughing, at functional residual capacity (FRC). We found that following bronchodilator there was an increase in maximum expiratory flow rates, and a proportionally greater increase in cough peak flow. relaxationof sronchial smooth muscle and an increase in airway cross-sectional area. This would increase maximum flow rates (according to wave speed theory) both for maximum expiratory flow and for cough. In addition, bronchodilators would increase airway distensibility, which would lead to a fall in expiratory flow rates. We suggest that the different magnitude of change in maximum expiratory flow and cough peak flow caused by bronchodilator is brought about by differences in the relative influences of these two factors.

Spesific etiologic diagnosis of highly febrile children should have marked influence when the necessity for antibiotc therapy is considered. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy is widely practiced in adults under sedation, without the need for a general anaesthetic. In children a general anaesthetic is required which removes one of the major advantages of this method. The size of the bronchoscope reduces the available tracheal leumen for anaesthesia and the 4 . 9 mm fiberoptic bronchoscope is only suitable for children down to approximately 29 years old. The main advantages of the flexible bronchoscope is its manourverability. The upper lobe bronchi are easily visualised merely by flexing and advancing the bronchoscope.",

A s a part of standardized questionnaire on respiratory health, the total number of cigarettes smoked by both parents was estimated and added. It was concluded that EC and EC% are significantly correlated with the total numbers of cigarettes smoked by parents and suggested that this can be an important pathway in the previously described effects of passive smoking upon lung function in children. Seven asthmatic and 12 elite children swimmers without bronchial asthma, swam intervals at a speed 5% below, at the calculated aerobic capacity, and 5% above. Bronchial reactivity was measured by PC-20 histamine 15 minutes before and 15 minutes after the swimming exercises. Lung function, blood gases and blood lactate were measured before swimming, in each interval during swimming and afterwards. Heart rate was recorded electronically during the entire exercise period. Maximal 00, was measured by the Douglas bag method on swimming in a counter-current swim-mill with variable speed of the water flow. PC-20 ranged from 0.145 to 32 mg/ml. Bronchial reactivity increased from before to after swimming ( Variations of bronchial permeability and reactivity related to growth of children can only be measured with follow-up studies: the latter are difficult to perform and data from literature are scanty. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that in children bronchial reactivity decreases with age and that factors like passive smoking can impair lung growth. In order to contribute to this field, 7 5 non-asthmatic children, of the initial age of 11 years ( 4 0 females, 35 males) randomly chosen from a school population of Bologna (Italy) performed annually for three consecutive years a spirometric evaluation before and after an exercise test (free maximal running for 6 minutes). Results showed that: 1) the three years according to predicted values: however, children with passive smoking (one or both parents smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day) showed smaller increase when compared with children of non-smoking parents. The difference was statistically significant for PEF (~(0.01) and FEF 25-75 (p<O.OOl). To study whether bronchial reactivity to exercise is dependent on baseline lung function, 84 asthmatic children aged 7-16 years were investigated. The per centage fall in PEF values after a standard exercise running test was 9.4 2 8.6% in those 39 children with an attack rate of less than 10 per year and 29.6 2 23.3% in those 45 children with an attack rate of 10 or more per year (pC 0.001). A significant negative correlation (r= -0.46, p(O.001) was found between pre-exercise MMEF as well as between other sensitive and reproducible tests of airway calibre and the response to exercise. Such a correlation was not found between the baseline PEF or SGaw values and the exercise response (r=-O.l6 and -0.20, respectively, p>0.05). These results show t h a t bronchial hyperreactivity to exercise is dependent on the residual airway obstruction, but a wide variety of reactivity can occur.",

Bronchoalveolar lavage (W) is widely used f o r the diagnosis of opportunistic infections in immcccsnpromised adults with i n t e r s t i t i a l pn-nitis ( I P ) , but i s s t i l l infrequent in children.

Mean count cell and cytological p r o f i l e showed no significant differences according to the infectious agent nor underlying disease except i n those c h i ldren with AIDS who had significant lynpkcytosis (28?17 % ) .

In the postwver years there was a new epidemic of tuberculosis in most of the european countries. Such high incidences of childhood tuberculosis we find today only in developing countries linked with a high prevalence of bacillary lungtuberculosis and a low level of social and hygienic conditions. In european industrial countries in general low tuberculosis prevelance is existing, but there are reparkable differences in the rate of tuberculosis in child-hood. Ve see the reason f o r it in the different preventiv measu-es taken against tuberculosis in general as f o r children, especially in form on XGvaccination of the newborns.

            "text": "There is convincing e~i d e n c e~~,~~ that SARs are responsible for the classical Hering-Breuer inflation reflex (i.e., the termination of inspiration and prolongation of expiratory time on lung inflation) which, in anesthetized animals, provides the predominant mechanism for regulating the depth and rate of breathing. In fact the activity of SARs related to lung volume, together with the output from bulbopontine neurons, determines the duration of the respiratory cycle and the tidal volume of anesthetized animals.84 A volume threshold, which depends on a given SAR activity, must be achieved to terminate inspiration, and the magnitude of this threshold decreases with time from the onset of inspiration, i.e., larger volumes are needed to switch off inspiration at shorter inspiratory durations. In the absence of volume feedback inspiratory duration is determined only by the bulbopontine mechanism. Expiratory duration is dependent on the duration of the preceding inspiration. The inverse relationship between cycle duration and tidal volume results in an increase in both the rate and depth of respiration when the drive to breathe increases. Without vagal afferents, only the tidal volume will increase in most hyperventilatory circumstances. However, this model does not satisfactorily explain the experimental observations in humanss5 or conscious animals.s6-sa The observation of a reduced vagal feedback in the newborn42.49.52.53 appear to be at odds with the commonly held view that the Hering-Breuer reflex is stronger in the n e w b~r n .~~~~~ This conclusion is based primarily on the presence of inflation apnea in the sleeping newborn and the lack of Hering-Breuer reflexes in conscious a d u l t~.~~-~~ To be consistent with the hypothesis of a stronger Hering-Breuer reflex, the newborn should have an increased sensitivity of the \"respiratory centers\" to volume-related feedback resulting in a greater reflex effect even if afferent input is reduced compared with the adult. This might reflect an absence of welldeveloped higher influences that in the adult might inhibit the effect of volume feedback.85 On the other hand, as Cross et al.91 pointed out, differences in mechanical properties of the lung might be responsible for the apparent differences in reflex behavior. Indeed, recent comparisons of apnea in newborns and adults of several species following lung inflation and tilting, based on the same Pt, s t i m u l u~,~~~~~ would suggest weaker volume-related vagal reflexes. Moreover, when assessing the importance of the Hering-Breuer mechanism in the newborn, particular attention should be paid to the potential influence of afferents from the rib cage, which undergoes far greater distortion than in the Indeed, during distortion, rib cage afferents are known to provide an additional offswitch r n e c h a n i~m . '~~, '~~ SARs also play a role in the reflex regulation of smooth muscle tone and, in the adult, an increase in SAR activity leads to a reduction in the efferent vagal excitatory activity to airway smooth muscle.'05 This results in a negative feedback mechanism, which, it has been proposed, may serve to optimize the reciprocal relationship between dead space and airway resi~tance.''~ There is no information concerning this in the newborn except for the observations that the neuromuscular mechanism activating tracheobronchial smooth muscle is weaker in the new-born77 and that smooth muscle contraction may excite SARS.\"~ The observation that RAR activity increases as lung compliance is reduced, together with the fact that they function to promote inspiration, lob supports the hypothesis that RARs are important in the generation of augmented breaths or sighs.Io7 Indeed, in premature infants the ability to provoke an augmented breath is inversely related to dynamic compliance. Furthermore the increase in compliance that occurs with is accompanied by a decrease in the frequency of sighing ( figure 15) .110,111 Once again we are faced with an apparent discrepancy between the above observations and the scant RAR . .Allergy Research Foundation, Inc., Los Angeles, U.S.A.
