A recent study on the global burden of paediatric pneumonia conducted in seven countries found that viruses account for about 61% of all paediatric pneumonia infections, while about 27% of infection were attributed to bacterial pathogens, with RSV accounting for the largest etiological fraction of paediatric pneumonia 1 . More than 90% of the deaths that occur due to pneumonia in children under 5, occur in low resource settings, mainly due to the lack of paediatric intensive care facilities 2 . Very young infants especially those with comorbidities such as HIV and malnutrition have a poor survival prognosis following pneumonia infection. HIV-infected infants who develop a pneumonia infection are up to 10 times more likely to die from the infection than non-HIV infected children 3 , while those with malnutrition are more than 3 times more likely to die after admission 4 . The damage to the lungs caused by severe pneumonia appears to persist even after discharge from hospital, with recent estimates showing that post-discharge mortality in African children previously admitted to hospital with pneumonia being 2.5 times greater than those discharged with other diagnosis 5 .",

An improved understanding of the immunobiology of this elevated post infection mortality risk will be crucial in identifying prognostic biomarkers of poor outcome, which will be critical in guiding care decisions in the first critical hours after admission. Most studies on the mechanisms of severe pneumonia in infants have been done using blood samples 6 , and whist these studies have provided significant insights into disease pathology, they might not fully recapitulate the immune response to infection in the airway. In the case of RSV, there has only been one study in the last 60 years that examined the lung samples of children who died from pneumonia. Archived post-mortem lung tissue from three children who died in the pre-intensivist era in the USA in the 1930s and 1940s was evaluated and airway obstruction with inflammatory cells, fibrin, mucus, and fluid identified as a prominent feature in RSV lung infection 7 . Staining for immune cell populations was not technically feasible in these long term archival samples.",

This effort has traditionally been limited by the unsuitability of routine airway sampling techniques for conventional cytometric analyses. Samples from nasopharyngeal washings and naso-and oropharyngeal swabbing are the most common methods of sampling the airways of sick children, and whilst ideal for molecular diagnostics, they are less suitable for phenotyping of airway resident immune cells using conventional cytometry techniques. Sampling of the airway by these methods typically results in limited cell yields and the cells that are recovered are generally highly enriched for granulocytes, precluding detailed characterisation of less abundant phenotypes using traditional flow cytometry-based tools 8 . Recent analysis of the cellular composition of upper airway by flow cytometry showed that the typical abundances of critical effector cells like T Cells, B Cells, Mast cells, Dendritic cells and NK cells to be less than 0.5% of all airway cells, while granulocytes were present at a median frequency of >90% 9 .",

We have recently described a high-resolution mass-spectrometry-based proteomics approach for characterizing the total proteome of the infant airway to a depth of more than 1,800 proteins 10, 11 . The airway proteome characterized by this technique represents an unbiased snapshot of the underlying cell populations and can be leveraged to infer changes in the frequencies of the contributing cell phenotypes. Here, we describe an in-silico immune cell phenotype deconvolution approach where we use protein markers that are uniquely expressed by different immune cell phenotypes to infer the dynamics of those phenotypes in airways of children who survived or died following a pneumonia infection. Phenotype-specific markers were derived from a previously published data set containing the individual proteomes of purified immune cell populations (deconvolution data set) and these were then applied to airway proteome data from children with different pneumonia outcomes.",

Figure 1 is a graphical flowchart of the experimental and analytical design features of this study. We used ordination analysis by nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to visualize differences in phenotype specific protein expression in the deconvolution data set in order to determine whether differences in overall protein expression could be used to resolve major immune phenotypes on the basis of protein expression alone. The NMDS analysis showed that major immune cell phenotypes including B-cells, T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells(DC), monocytes (MO), basophils, eosinophils and neutrophils could be distinctly segregated on the basis of differential protein expression (figure 2a). We then set out to identify individual protein markers that could be used to accurately distinguish major and sub immune phenotypes (sub phenotypes defined as lower functional hierarchies of the major phenotypes -e.g. plasmacytoid or myeloid DCs) within the deconvolution data set. Using random forest (RF) classification we identified protein classification features for 33 immune cell phenotypes (supplementary table 1b) which were differentially expressed between the phenotypes and that could potentially be used to disaggregate them (see methods for details of the RF procedure). We then examined the airway proteomes of children with pneumonia to determine whether any of the RF-derived classifiers from the deconvolution data set were also present in the infant airways. For some cell types such as monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils, a substantial proportion (>30%) of the RF classifiers from the deconvolution analysis were also expressed in the airway, while for others (e.g NK cells), a lower proportion of the classifiers were identified in the airway (figures 2B,D,F & H). Supplementary table 1a contains a complete list of all the RF-derived classifiers for different immune cell phenotypes and sub phenotypes and their respective expression levels in the infant airway.",

For each classifier protein, the difference between its mean expression level within the phenotype from which it was derived was calculated relative to all other phenotypes and the difference expressed as a fold change. Figure 3A shows an example of such a comparison for classical activated monocytes (MO_classical_activated). For this phenotype, some of its classifier proteins -for example SERPINB2-were expressed at significantly higher levels in We then applied the RF-markers to the airway proteome data of children who survived or succumbed to a severe pneumonia infection in order to determine whether there were differences in the expression of immune phenotype markers by survival status. We noted that the expression levels of eosinophil-specific RF markers were significantly overexpressed in children who survived infection, relative to non-survivors (P<0.0001) and well controls ( figure 4B ). This was in contrast to neutrophils, whose RF markers did not vary by survival status (figure 4B). The RF classifiers for other phenotypes including na\u00efve CD8 T cells (T8.naive) were also significantly elevated in pneumonia survivors compared to children who died within 48 hours of admission (P<0.05) and well controls while those of phenotypes and sub phenotypes of B cells, monocytes and dendritic cells were not significantly different between children who survived or succumbed to pneumonia (figure 4C). To validate these findings, we reviewed the clinical records of >10,000 children who had been admitted to Kilifi County Hospital over a >10 year period with clinical pneumonia and for whom haematological data (including blood frequencies of eosinophils and neutrophils) had been collected at admission. These data were stratified by survival status and the difference in the frequency of eosinophils and neutrophils was determined. The results of these analyses showed that the frequency of eosinophils in children who survived pneumonia in the retrospective validation cohort (N=10,859) was significantly higher than that of children who died (N=1,604) following admission with clinical pneumonia (p=0.0004 ) - Figure 5A .

The respiratory response to pneumonia is characterised by the recruitment of a broad array of immune cells, which contribute to the resolution of the infection, but in some instances, have been implicated in increased pathology. The study mucosal cellular immunity during very severe pneumonia has been hindered by a number of important hurdles including the availability of low sample volumes young pneumonia patients, as well as the relatively low abundance of immune cells that may be critical in directing the clinical course of pneumonia. In this study, we addressed these problems by using an unsupervised learning approach to identify and validate protein markers that could be used to deconvolve mixed immune cells. We then applied these markers to airway proteome data obtained from children with different survival outcomes of clinical pneumonia. Our results show that protein markers associated with eosinophils are elevated in the airways of survivors and are diminished in children who later died from infection. The airway levels of these eosinophil markers were no different between children who died and well controls, indicating a possible failure to mount an appropriate eosinophil response as a potential mechanism of pneumonia-related mortality. To validate the findings of the airway proteome analysis, we reviewed the hospitalisation records of >10,000 children who had been admitted to hospital in the previous 10 years with clinical pneumonia. The results of this retrospective analysis confirmed the observations made from analysis of the airway proteome and showed that children who died from pneumonia, had significantly lower blood eosinophil counts relative to those who survived. In contrast, neutrophil levels were not different between survivors and non survivors in both the airway proteome and in the retrospective validation cohort.",

Taken together with the results of the current study, these results demonstrate a clear role for eosinophils in an effective airway response to pneumonia and further highlight the power of using phenotype markers to infer the dynamic characteristics immune cells in the airway. The results of the current study highlights that the critical role of airway eosinophils might extend beyond just a rapid resolution of infection, but that these cells may be a crucial factor for survival in children with severe pneumonia. A potential limitation of our study is that it was carried out using samples collected from the upper airway and not the lung. While lung samples would have undoubtedly been more informative of responses at the site of disease, the collection of these samples is a highly invasive process and exposes children to substantial additional risk without providing additional diagnostic value above nasopharyngeal or peripheral blood sampling. As a result, these samples are generally only available in settings with paediatric intensive care facilities, and even here, they are generally collected in children with atypically severe disease.",

The initial response to infection is characterised by the airway recruitment of neutrophils, which express markers such as CD11b (ITGAM) and neutrophil granule proteins such as neutrophil elastase (ELANE) 20, 21 . Other innate immune cells such as NK cells which expressed granzyme B are recruited in the lower airway and can be detected in in the lungs of mechanically-ventilated children with very severe pneumonia 22, 23 . In addition to these cells, both myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells are typically recruited into the airways of children with pneumonia in the early stages of infection 22, 24 and exhibit an activated proinflammatory phenotype 22 . Adaptive immune cells including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are present in airway samples for children with viral pneumonia 25, 26 . During infection, airway frequencies of granzyme B-secreting, activated CD8 T cells is greater in the airways of children with severe viral pneumonia 23 . In the present study, we found that protein markers of different phenotypes of CD8 T cells were significantly elevated in the airways of children who survived pneumonia relative to those who died or well controls. Although the frequencies of these cells were not available for validation in the retrospective cohort, the data suggests a role for these cells in pneumonia survival. Previous studies in mechanically ventilated children showed that the frequency of lung-associated T cells increased as children recovered from infection, suggesting that these cells are an important compoentent of effective local immunity against pneumonia and that deficits in the airways of children with pneumonia is a significant risk factor for mortality. In summary, the present data identifies a new approach for characterising the cellular immune response to pneumonia in the airway and identified critical immune populations that appear to be critical for survival. Future studies should aim to replicate these findings in samples collected from the lower respiratory tract.",

To achieve better phenotype partitioning at the phenotype and sub-phenotype level, we used random forest (RF) classification to derive protein markers that could be used to distinguish specific phenotype (e.g. DCs) or sub-phenotype (pDCs or mDCs) from all others.

Neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, NK cells, dendritic cells, basophils among others were clearly separated in the t-SNE plot from all other phenotypes. There was less clear segregation for T-cell sub phenotypes, including CD8, CD4 and regulatory T-cell phenotypes. (B) the expression of eosinophil-and neutrophil-specific RF classifiers was compared between children with different survival outcomes of pneumonia as well as in well controls. Eosinophil RF markers were expressed at significantly higher levels in survivors compared with children who died and well controls. In contrast, there was no difference in the expression of neutrophil RF markers between these groups. (C) RF classifiers of other immune cell phenotypes were also compared by survival status. No significant difference in the RF expression of most phenotypes by survival status",

The median expression level of SERPINB2 in classical activated monocytes for example, was >10 4 fold higher in these cells, relative to all other phenotypes (figure 3B). Of the 64 protein classifiers identified in the RF analysis for this phenotype, 17 were detected in the airway samples from children with pneumonia (figure 3C), with SERPINB2 being detected at relatively high levels (median 37,309 MS reporter corrected intensity). For each phenotype, we then generated a phenotype classification profile where the expression levels of all classifier proteins of a particular phenotype were plotted relative to the expression level of the same proteins in all other phenotypes. An example of this analysis is shown in figure 3D, where the combined expression levels monocyte-derived RF classifiers were compared with all other phenotypes. The expression profile of these proteins was significantly higher in monocytes compared to all other proteins (p<0.0001). A comprehensive analysis of the combined expression profiles of the RF markers of all other phenotypes are presented in supplementary figure 1. We used t-SNE dimensional reduction analysis to visualise phenotype segregation on the basis of RF-classification markers (figure 4A). The results of this analysis showed that the RF classifiers could clearly resolve most of the immune cell types, with phenotypes such as plasma cells (B.plasma), pDC, mDC, eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils and different monocyte sub phenotypes being clearly distinguishable from the rest of the phenotypes. Some subphenotypes such as central memory CD4 T cells (T4.CM) and effector memory CD4 T cells (T4.EM), could not be clearly disaggregated on the basis of RF protein expression alone.",

For LFQ protein quantification; elution was carried out with mobile phase B (80% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) gradient (4 to 30%) over 310 min at a flow rate of 0.25 \u03bcl/min. Each LC run was finished by washout with 98% B for 10 min and re-equilibration in 2% B for 30 min. Five blanks of 40 min each were run on the column between each injection comprising of two wash cycles with 90% B and an equilibration phase of 15 min to avoid sample carryover. Peptides were measured using a Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) coupled to the chromatography system via a nano-electrospray ion source (Thermo Scientific). On the Q Exactive , the ms^1 settings for peptides were: Resolution, 70000; AGC target, 3e6; maximum IT, 120 ms; scan range, 400-1800 m/z; while the ms^2 settings for fragmentation spectra of peptides were: Resolution, 17000 (35000 for labelled peptides); AGC target, 5e4; maximum IT, 120 ms ; isolation window, 1.6 m/z. MS data were acquired by data dependent acquisition where the top 12 (15 for labelled peptides) most intense precursor ions in positive mode were selected for ms^2 Higher-energy C-trap dissociation fragmentation which were subsequently excluded for the next 45 s following fragmentation event. Charge exclusion was set to ignore peptide spectrum matches that were unassigned, singly charged, and those with \u2265+8 charges.

The remaining 200\u00b5l were split into two aliquots of 100\u00b5l each. The first aliquot was used for neutrophil phenotyping assays and the other was used for neutrophil phagocytosis assays. 20\u00b5l of a pre-constituted cocktail of the following antibodies (from ThermoFisher) was used to label both aliquots -CD45, CD16, CD14, CD3, CD19, HLA-DR, CD66b, CD11b and a Live-dead marker. With the exception of the live/dead marker, all other antibodies were diluted 1:100 in FACS buffer. The live/dead marker was prepared at a 1:1000 dilution in FACS buffer. For the phagocytosis assay tube, 20 l of opsonised Escherichia coli (E.coli) was added to the tube (pHrodo Red E. coli BioParticles; ThermoFisher). The bacteria was initially prepared by mixing the E.coli strain with newborn calf sera followed by a 30-minute incubation at 37 o C. After this step, both tubes were incubated at 37 o C for 35 minutes. After the incubation, 20 l of a live-dead marker was added to each tube and incubated for 10 minutes at 37 o C. The reaction was stopped by adding 500 l of 1X RBC lysis buffer followed by a 5-minute incubation. Cells in each tube were then spun down at 2,700xg for 1 minute and the supernatant discarded. Cells were then washed twice with FACS buffer, after which 350 l of FACS flow was added.",

Each spoke of the wheel represents a single protein, and each segment on a spoke represents the difference (expressed as log10 fold change) between the expression level of the protein in classical activated monocytes and the listed cell types.
