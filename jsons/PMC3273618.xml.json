Additionally, a CDV outbreak in East Africa killed more than 1000 lions (Panthera leo) (Munson et al., 2008, Roelke-Parker et al., 1996).",

            "text": "Animals that hunt and scavenge are likely exposed to a broad array of pathogens (Schulenburg et al., 2009). Although most carnivores, including lions and wild dogs, scavenge to some extent (Houston, 1979), theory predicts that the immune systems of carnivores exhibiting morphological specializations for carrion-feeding should have been molded by selective pressures associated with surviving microbial assaults from their food (Blount et al., 2003, Mendes et al., 2006, Schulenburg et al., 2009). Spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) are capable hunters that have descended within the last million years from carrion feeding ancestors (Lewis and Werdelin, 2000, Werdelin, 1989). Despite documented exposure to anthrax, rabies, CDV and several other pathogens, spotted hyenas in East Africa have exhibited extremely low mortality rates due to infectious diseases, even when epizootics decimated sympatric carnivore populations (Alexander et al., 1995, East et al., 2001, East et al., 2004, Harrison et al., 2004, Lembo et al., 2011, Watts and Holekamp, 2009). Spotted hyenas are the most abundant large carnivores in Africa, and may play a critical role in the ecology of disease in African wildlife and domestic animals throughout the continent (Hofer, 1998).",

The two specific aims of this study were to identify antibodies that cross-react with hyena immunoglobulins and to assess the dynamics of the hyena humoral immune response to immunization with a non-pathogenic antigen. Domestic cats (Felis catus) were the closest phylogenetic relatives of hyenas that had been studied in detail immunologically (Bininda-Emonds et al., 1999, O\u2019Brien and Johnson, 2005), and we hypothesized that anti-cat isotype-specific antibodies would cross react with hyena immunoglobulin (Ig) epitopes.",

Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), serum neutralization tests, western blots, and agglutination tests have been used previously to document pathogen exposure in spotted hyenas (East et al., 2001, East et al., 2004, Honer et al., 2006, Speck et al., 2008), but only a few studies have gone beyond documenting exposure and examined the immune response itself (East et al., 2008, Hanley et al., 2005, Honer et al., 2006, van Helden et al., 2008). The current paper represents the first report of antibodies capable of detecting spotted hyena immunoglobulins other than IgG, and the first to document the temporal dynamics of the humoral immune response of the major isotypes with a defined antigen.",

Interestingly, however, the four youngest individuals immunized attained the four highest anti-DNP titers across all isotypes tested, regardless of whether or not they received adjuvant with the initial immunization (Table 2). The oldest hyena, individual H, was 17 years old at the initial immunization and did not receive adjuvant. Individual H did not produce a detectable response at a 1:100 serum dilution using mAb detection antibodies for IgG and \u03bb, but did produce detectable responses for all other isotypes tested.",

Testing for both IgG and IgM has been used previously to stage infections; this method was used to assess whether infections are in earlier or later stages for tularemia (Carlsson et al., 1979), dengue (Innis et al., 1989), Rift Valley Fever (Pepin et al., 2010), myxomatosis in rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculs) (Kerr, 1997), and West Nile virus in equids (Durand et al., 2002). Pathogens to which wild spotted hyenas are known to be exposed include CDV, FIV, feline panleukopenia virus/canine parvovirus, feline coronavirus/feline infectious peritonitis virus, feline calicivirus, rabies, and bluetongue (Alexander et al., 1994, East et al., 2001, Harrison et al., 2004, Troyer et al., 2005). The temporal dynamics apparent in the changing Ig ratios (Fig. 3) in our hyena subjects might be carefully exploited to stage infections. However, we emphasize that samples positive for IgM, but negative for IgG, must be interpreted cautiously, as this might indicate either an early stage infection or simply the presence of natural antibodies (Ochsenbein and Zinkernagel, 2000). The results of our experimental immunizations of captive hyenas show that all individuals had readily detectable anti-DNP IgM in pre-immune sera. Pre-infection sera are seldom available in serological studies of wildlife, so natural IgM might be misinterpreted as an active infection based solely on agglutination tests. Thus, ELISA or Western blots for IgG, IgA, and/or IgE in addition to assays for IgM are more effective for serological studies than agglutination tests alone.",

Within 2\u20135 weeks of birth, spotted hyena cubs are transferred from an isolated natal den to a communal den where they live with up to 20 other cubs, and frequently engage in playful and aggressive interactions (Holekamp and Smale, 1998, Kruuk, 1972, Tanner et al., 2007). The frequent social interactions at communal dens create a situation that can lead to high rates of transmission of infectious pathogens (Altizer et al., 2003). Maternal IgG and IgA transferred from mother to offspring in milk could provide critical protection from pathogens during early life stages (Bourne and Curtis, 1973, Brambell, 1966, Claus et al., 2006, Mason et al., 1930).",

Rabies virus has been detected in saliva of spotted hyenas expressing no clinical signs of disease (East et al., 2001); salivary IgA might play an important role in both intra- and inter-specific transmission of rabies by neutralizing the virus in saliva before the virus has a chance to infect new individuals. Furthermore, fecal samples are the most readily available and least invasive samples available in most studies of free-living carnivores, and these typically contain large quantities of IgA.

IgE is the primary isotype involved in defense against parasitic worms. Our study has identified two cross-reacting mAb against hyena IgE in ELISAs (Table 1) that might be used to assess effects of parasites on Ig concentrations and ratios. However, the specific binding of the anti-IgE mAbs could not be confirmed here by Western blot, possibly due to the low concentration and short half-life of IgE in serum. IgE and IgG1 are associated with Th2 response (Mosmann and Coffman, 1989, Mosmann and Sad, 1996, Romagnani, 1997), a topic that is ripe for a comparative study. For example, it would be interesting to compare Th1 and Th2 markers in captive hyenas living in relatively clean environments with wild hyenas that face a continual assault from food-borne and socially transmitted pathogens.",

The antibodies identified here can be used for monitoring the health of both wild and captive hyenas. We have shown that the cross-reacting antibodies can be used to assess specific antibody titer by ELISA; it is probable that these antibodies can also be used in Western blots for detecting antibodies against specific pathogens, which is commonly done to confirm ELISA or RT-PCR results. Finally, these basic immunology tools open the door to more advanced studies of immune function in a species that has demonstrated the remarkable ability to survive disease outbreaks that have decimated wild populations of other carnivore species living sympatrically with spotted hyenas.",
