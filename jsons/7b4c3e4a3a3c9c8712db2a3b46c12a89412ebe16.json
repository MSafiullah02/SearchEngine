Among coronaviruses, the main protease (M pro ) is an essential drug target which, along with papain-like proteases catalyzes the processing of polyproteins translated from viral RNA and recognizes specific cleavage sites. There are no human proteases with similar cleavage specificity and therefore, inhibitors are highly likely to be nontoxic. Therefore, targeting the SARS-CoV-2 M pro enzyme with small molecules can block viral replication. The present study is aimed at the identification of promising lead molecules for SARS-CoV-2 M pro enzyme through virtual screening of antiviral compounds from plants. The binding affinity of selected small drug-like molecules to SARS-CoV-2 M pro , SARS-CoV M pro and MERS-CoV M pro were studied using molecular docking. Bonducellpin D was identified as the best lead molecule which shows higher binding affinity (-9.28 kcal/mol) as compared to the control (-8.24 kcal/mol). The molecular binding was stabilized through four hydrogen bonds with Glu166 and Thr190 as well as hydrophobic interactions via eight residues. The SARS-CoV-2 M pro shows identities of 96.08% and 50.65% to that of SARS-CoV M pro and MERS-CoV M pro respectively at the sequence level. At the structural level, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) between SARS-CoV-2 M pro and SARS-CoV M pro was found to be 0.517 \u00c5 and 0.817 \u00c5 between SARS-CoV-2 M pro and MERS-CoV M pro . Bonducellpin D exhibited broad-spectrum inhibition potential against SARS-CoV M pro and MERS-CoV M pro and therefore is a promising drug candidate, which needs further validations through in vitro and in vivo studies.

Table 2 ). The results show that the binding energies and inhibition constant values of the phytochemicals were lower as compared to the majority of the approved antiviral drugs except for Nelfinavir (-9.54 kcal/mol), Boceprevir (-9.3 kcal/mol) and Simeprevir (-11.1 kcal/mol) which indicates that these phytochemicals have higher binding affinity to the target enzyme as compared to the antiviral drugs.",

They are classified into four main subgroups-alpha, beta, gamma, and delta depending on their genomic structure [1] . Alpha-and beta coronaviruses cause respiratory infections in humans and gastroenteritis in other mammals [2, 3] . Likewise, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) caused a disastrous pandemic in 2012 leading to 37% mortality [1] . All coronaviruses infecting humans usually known to have intermediate hosts such as bats or rodents [4] . Previous outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV involved civet cats and dromedary camels for their direct transmission to humans [1] . A new coronavirus caused an outbreak of the pulmonary disease in Wuhan (the capital of Hubei province in China) in December 2019 and has since spread across different parts of the world [5, 6] . Since its RNA genome shows about 82% identity to that of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the new virus has been termed as SARS-CoV-2 [7] . However, both these viruses belong to the same clade of the genus Betacoronavirus [5, 6] . The SARS-CoV-2 caused a disease known as COVID-19. At the initial outbreak, cases were linked to the Huanan seafood and animal market in Wuhan but active human-to-human transmission caused exponential growth in the number of reported cases. The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed the outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020. There have been more than 170,000 cumulative cases worldwide accounting for approximately 3.7% case-fatality rate as of March 15, 2020 [8] .",

            "text": "Due to the close similarity to SARS-CoV, the biochemical interactions and the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 are highly likely to be similar [1] . The virus entry into the host cell is mainly mediated through the binding of the SARS spike (S) protein to the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor on the cell surface [9] . Among coronaviruses, the main protease (M pro , also called 3CL pro ) has emerged as the best-described drug target [10] . The J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 4 polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA are processed by this enzyme together with the papain-like protease(s) [11] . The M pro recognizes and acts remarkably on eleven cleavage sites typically Leu-Gln\u2193(Ser,Ala,Gly) on the large polyprotein 1ab (replicase 1ab) of approximately 790 kDa. Blocking the activity of this enzyme would help in inhibiting viral replication. There are no reported human proteases with a similar cleavage specificity and therefore, inhibitors against this enzyme are less probable to be toxic [8] . The three dimensional X-ray crystal structure of this enzyme in complex with \u03b1-ketoamide inhibitor 13b (O6K) was recently solved by Zhang et al. (2020) (PDB ID: 6Y2F) which offers an opportunity for structure-based drug design against the enzyme target. Understanding the relevance of the steady rise in the number of infected and death cases in recent time from COVID-19 and lack of effective therapeutic interventions such as drugs and vaccines, computer-aided drug design is an important strategy to be sought after. This rational based drug design will reduce the cost and time incurred in the drug discovery process. Structure-based drug design primarily relies on molecular docking to identify lead molecules against the target proteins from chemical libraries [12, 13] . Compared to the synthetic inhibitors plant based-drugs have less toxicity and much safer to use. The natural products such as traditional medicines and plant-derived compounds (phytochemicals) are the rich sources of promising antiviral drugs [14] . Around 44% of the approved antiviral drugs between 1981 and 2006 were derived from natural products [15] . The plant extracts have been extensively used and screened for drug molecules to evaluate theirs in vitro antiviral activities. Few examples of medicinal plants with proven antiviral activities include Phyllanthus amarus Schum. and Thonn which blocks human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication both in vitro and in vivo [16] ; Azadirachta indica Juss. (Neem) shows in vitro and in vivo inhibition properties against Dengue virus type-2 (DENV-2) [17] ; Geranium sanguineum L. significantly inhibits the replication of Herpes simplex virus type-1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) in vitro [18] ; Acacia nilotica L. possesses activity against Hepatitis C virus (HCV) in vitro etc [19] .",

The MSA results show the conservation of residues in the three domains-I (residues 1-99), II (residues 100-182) and III (residues 199-306) of the SARS-CoV-2 M pro enzyme which includes catalytic dyad residues His41-Cys145 located in a cleft between domains I and II along with canonical oxyanion hole residues Gly143, Ser144 and Cys145(Figure 1). Domains I and II have a typical chymotrypsin-like two-\u03b2-barrel fold. Domain III possesses a globular structure consisting of five \u03b1-helices which is connected to Domain II by a loop of residues 183-198[32]. The pairwise structural imposition of SARS-CoV-2 M pro and SARS-CoV M pro yields an RMSD value of 0.517 \u00c5 while an RMSD value of 0.817 \u00c5 was obtained when SARS-CoV-2 M pro was superimposed on MERS-CoV M pro(Figure 2). This indicates that SARS-CoV-2 M pro is structurally more close to SARS-CoV M pro as compared to MERS-CoV M pro . This comparative study at the sequence and structural level can be exploited for the design of broad-spectrum inhibitors which can block viral infection in host cells.3.5. Binding interaction studies of drug-like molecules with SARS-CoV-2 M pro docking protocol and algorithm was validated through the redocking experiment. The redocking result of co-crystal compound (6OK) shows an RMSD value of 3.603 \u00c5 between the docked and native co-crystal position. This small deviation indicates that the docking protocols and parameters used in the study can reliably estimate the biological conformations of the compounds [33]. The ten selected drug-like small molecules were docked into the active site pocket of SARS-CoV-2 M pro . The molecular docking results are shown in Table 5. The docking scores were bench-marked using the standard inhibitor, \u03b1-ketoamide 13 b (6OK). The \u03b1-ketoamide 13 b is a broad-spectrum inhibitor with an IC 50 value of 0.67\u00b10.18 \u00b5M, 0.90\u00b10.29 \u00b5M and 0.58\u00b10.22 \u00b5M respectively against purified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 M pro , SARS-CoV M pro and MERS-CoV M pro [8]. On comparing the binding energies and inhibition constants with that of the standard inhibitor, we have shortlisted three lead molecules viz., Bonducellpin D, 5,7dimethoxyflavanone-4'-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside and Caesalmin B. Bonducellpin D and Caesalmin B are terpenoids isolated from the seeds of traditional Chinese medicinal plant Caesalpinia minax and exhibit in vitro inhibitory activities against Parainfluenza-3 (PI-3) virus. [34] The flavonoid 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4'-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside has previously been reported to have antiviral activity against PI-3 [35]. The molecular interactions of LigPLot results are represented in Table 6. The best-ranked lead molecule i.e., Bonducellpin D interacts with the enzyme target with a binding energy of -9.28 kcal/mol and inhibition constant of 156.75 nM. Bonducellpin D establishes four hydrogen bonds with residues Glu166 and Thr190 and hydrophobic interactions via eight residues (Met49, His164, Met165, Pro168, Asp187, Arg188, Gln189 and Gln192) (Figure 3A). The second lead molecule i.e., 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4'-O\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside interacts with the target enzyme with a binding energy of -9.23 kcal/mol and inhibition constant of 170.31 nM. This interaction is strengthed by the establishment of five hydrogen bonds with residues Glu166, Thr190 and Gln192 and with the involvement of thirteen residues (Phe140, Leu141, Asn142, Gly143, Ser144, Cys145, His164, Met165, Leu167, Pro168, His172, Arg188 and Gln189) contributing to hydrophobic interactions (Figure 3B). The third lead molecule-Caesalmin B interacts with SARS-CoV-2 M pro with a binding energy of -8.82 kcal/mol and inhibition constant of 342.79 nM. The molecular interaction is facilitated through four hydrogen bonds with residues Glu166, Thr190 and Gln192 and hydrophobic interactions via ten residues (His41, Met49, Tyr54, Cys145, His164, Met165, Leu167, Asp187, Arg188 and",

The best-ranked lead molecule i.e.,Bonducellpin D exhibits binding energies and inhibition constants of -8.64 kcal/mol and 467.11 nM; -8.93 kcal/mol and 284.86 nM against SARS-CoV M pro and MERS-CoV M pro respectively.

Caesalmin B shows optimum binding to SARS-CoV M pro by forming two hydrogen bonds with residues Gly143 and Glu166 and hydrophobic interactions via residues His41, Leu141, Asn142, Ser144, Cys145, His163, His164, Met165 and Gln189 (N=9) (Figure 4C). It also exhibits good binding to MERS-CoV M pro by establishing three hydrogen bonds with residues Cys145, Cys148 and His166 and hydrophobic interactions via residues Met25, Thr26, Leu27, Phe143, Leu144, Gly146, Ser147, Gln167, Met168, Glu169 and Gln192 (N=11) (Figure 5C).
