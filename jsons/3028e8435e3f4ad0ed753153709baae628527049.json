The SFAR does not recommend this therapeutic strategy in the actual context and strongly advise clinicians that placing multiple patients on a same ventilator should not be attempted, since data to guarantee the safe use of such procedure are largely lacking 1,2 . Similar recommendations were made by the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM), the American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC), the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (ASPF), the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses (AACN), and the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST).The logic underlying the use of a single ventilator to treat several patients may, at first glance, respond to our most precious and fundamental desire of saving lives of patients with acute respiratory failure in a context of resource shortage.",

This remains obviously true in COVID-19 patients for which personalised mechanical ventilation tailored to lung morphology may be of particular interest 5 .The pathophysiology of ARDS is complex and may involve modifications in lung mechanics(compliance) in relation with the evolution of the underlying causing pathology and the resuscitation strategy (e.g. fluid loading), which may require frequent adaptations of ventilator settings, including limited to tidal volume, positive end-expiratory pressure, use of recruitment manoeuvres, as well as prone positioning. Ventilating a patient with ARDS may be challenging, attempting to ventilate several patients on a single ventilator could expose all patients to an increased risk of complications or even increased mortality. Finally, placing several patients on a single ventilator implies considering the followings: -Providing accurate individualised monitoring of respiratory mechanics (including plateau pressure, tidal volume and the inspired fraction of oxygen), which is of critical importance in ARDS patients, would be not possible; -Providing individualised alarm monitoring and management (at least peak airway pressure, minimal and maximal tidal volume, minute ventilation), required for pressurecontrolled or volume-controlled ventilation modes, would be not possible, with could have possible dramatic consequences in case of pneumothorax; -In the case of a complication justifying interruption of ventilation in one patient, ventilation to all other patients would need to be stopped (possible aerosolisation of the virus in the context of COVID-19 patients) -Even if all patients have similar respiratory mechanics at initiation of ventilation, any deterioration in one patient (increased lung elastance) would led to significant inhomogeneity of tidal ventilation distribution -resulting in possible harm (volutrauma) to less seriously ill patients; -Spontaneous ventilation of a single patient would disrupt the respiratory cycle of all patients by imposing its frequency;",
