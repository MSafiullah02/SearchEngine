Four months prior to hospitalization she began experiencing fatigue, recurrent fevers, progressive muscle weakness, and behavioral changes. The week prior to admission, she had decreased urine output, increased abdominal girth and respiratory distress. She was admitted to a community hospital for possible pneumonia. After 3 days, she was transferred to a tertiary center for oncologic assessment. There, her physical examination was concerning for a tender right axillary lymph node and hepatosplenomegaly. A chest radiograph demonstrated diffuse airspace opacities. PCR studies identified both rhinovirus and mycoplasma in nasal pharyngeal swabs. Twenty-four hours after arrival she developed hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. This was complicated by an aspiration event and subsequent cardiopulmonary arrest, requiring resuscitation. Multiple subspecialties convened to facilitate an underlying diagnosis. HLH was considered given her hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, elevated CRP and normal ESR in the context of documented infection. Table 1 presents key HLH laboratory markers ordered at onset and their results. MAS, possibly associated with sJIA, was also considered despite the absence of arthritis, because of an intermittent, pink, net-like rash in the preceding weeks. Bone marrow evaluation was performed soon after her admission and demonstrated only rare hemophagocytes, similar to those seen in children with an underlying infection [5].",

Other complications included respiratory syncitial virus (RSV) infection and central line-related deep vein thrombosis requiring a six-week course of heparin sulfate. A brain MRI showed diffuse patchy white matter lesions most prominent in the right frontal lobe, suggestive of ischemia. Concern arose for adrenal insufficiency and she received several courses of stress dose corticosteroids with intermittent tapers. Intermittent episodes of fever and worsening cytopenias continued over the next month and HLH, possibly MAS, remained a consideration. For this reason an 18-day trial of anakinra was undertaken. However, fevers continued and abnormalities in liver enzymes along with hematologic abnormalities continued.",

This second mutation was located in the splice donor site of exon 20, and the A > G change at this position would likely cause splicing error. It was unclear if this represented a compound heterozygous mutation or if the two variants were on a single chromosome. Parental testing was initiated.

When compared to the initial assessment, there was subsequent marked reduction in natural killer (NK) cell function, CD107a upregulation and an elevation in soluble IL-2 (soluble CD25) receptor. Importantly, a drop in ANC (Figure 2a) and platelet count (Figure 2b) was identified during the end of the anakinra trial. Children with active HLH have been noted to have elevated white cell and platelet counts initially that decrease over time [6], as illustrated in our case. As a confounding feature, however, cytopenia is an uncommon but known side effect of anakinra. It is thus possible that addition of anakinra in our patient, with underlying MUNC 13\u20134 mutations, magnified the drop in platelet count and ANC that would have been seen with HLH alone. In addition, when ferritin was measured on the 15th day of anakinra therapy, the level was 629 ng/mL (above the aforementioned acceptable limit of 500 ng/mL), whereas one day after anakinra treatment was terminated, the ferritin level increased to 7129 ng/mL (Figure 2c). IL-1 is known to increase the synthesis of ferritin subunits in vitro[7]. We hypothesize, therefore, that anakinra administration inhibited the surge of ferritin that would have otherwise been identified in association with clinical progression of HLH.",

Clinical features of MAS similar to primary HLH include high unremitting fever, hepatosplenomegaly, hepatic dysfunction, lymphadenopathy, encephalopathy, cytopenia, elevated ferritin and coagulopathy [12,14]. Laboratory similarities include depressed natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxic function, elevated soluble IL-2 receptor levels and soluble CD163. In its early stages, MAS can be a diagnostic challenge due to the overlap of symptoms with the underlying autoimmune disease. Factors potentially differentiating HLH from MAS include: 1.) change from quotidian to persistent fever pattern; 2.) sudden change from cytosis to cytopenia; 3.) coagulopathy; and 4.) decreasing ESR. Preliminary diagnostic criteria have been examined for MAS in sJIA, which may help to improve diagnosis of this condition in these patients [13,15].",

            "text": "As mentioned before, HLH is diagnosed through clear clinical criteria. Despite awareness of the diagnostic criteria, HLH diagnosis can be challenging because of the variability in presentation. Symptoms, especially if infection associated, may spontaneously remit [3]. Individual diagnostic criteria can be observed at distinct points in the disease course and can also remit and recur. Moreover, many of the criteria are non-specific for HLH, making it a diagnosis of exclusion in many cases. Finally, criteria such as NK cell function and genetic testing can take weeks to be finalized. Given all these challenges, it is important to consider HLH as a diagnosis both at onset and in the early stages of the disease process. In a review of familial and acquired HLH, key laboratory findings in establishing a diagnosis were identified as negative or decreased NK function as well as elevated soluble CD25 levels in all patients [16], suggesting these studies must be evaluated early on in the clinical course. In some centers, CD107a upregulation, a marker of NK cell degranulation is used as a surrogate for NK cell cytotoxicity [17]. However, as depressed NK cell cytotoxicity is seen in many conditions secondary to inflammation or immunosuppressive factors, other symptoms must be considered. Fever and splenomegaly occur in approximately 70% of HLH patients [16]. Fevers may be protracted, variable and may even resolve spontaneously. About 50% of patients initially present with elevated triglycerides, high ferritin, high LDH and/or a combination of anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia [8,16]. Of note, ferritin is rarely > 200 \u03bcg/L in pediatric patients with infections outside of the context of HLH [16] and levels higher than this should raise suspicion for HLH. Lastly, hemophagocytosis is seen in less than 40% of patients at onset but is present in >80% of patients at time of diagnosis [16].",

These include Griscelli syndrome type 2, Hermansky Pudlak type II, Chediak Higashi and X-linked lymphoproliferative disease Type 1. Griscelli syndrome type 2 and Chediak Higashi syndrome are typically associated with albinism due to an effect upon melanocyte pigment secretion. Griscelli syndrome type 2 is identified by mutations in RAB27A while Chediak Higashi syndrome is associated with LYST mutations. Mutations of both these gene impair proteins important for formation and/or trafficking of secretory lysosomes [24]. In these syndromes, a gene defect interferes with lytic granules reaching the cytotoxic lymphocyte membrane, thus leading to impaired NK cell cytotoxicity. Patients with X-linked lymphoproliferative disease have difficulty clearing Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infected B-cells, with subsequent extensive lymphocytic expansion into multiple organs. The SH2D1A mutation, which encodes for the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM)-associated protein SAP, is identified in XLP1. Impaired cytolytic function in XLP1 is thought to cause accumulation EBV-infected B cells and persistence of reactive inflammatory cells, which combine to produce an exaggerated immune response [25].",

Initial treatment with an immunomodulatory regimen is recommended. Patients with primary HLH who fail to reach disease resolution within 8 weeks of treatment should continue on this regimen for an additional treatment course. Hematopoetic stem cell transplantation should be pursued as soon as a suitable donor is available for all patients with primary HLH, relapsed HLH, or those failing to progress on therapy [4]. There is no standard for the treatment of secondary HLH or MAS in the context of rheumatologic disease. High dose corticosteroids, biologic agents, cyclosporine and high dose intravenous immunoglobulin have been used with varying success. Anakinra, a recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, has been increasingly used for sJIA patients with MAS [24]. If initial treatment fails, HLH salvage therapy may be pursued according to the HLH 2004 chemotherapeutic regimens [14,12]. Confirmation of a genetic mutation is not needed for immediate management but is important in differentiating familial HLH and secondary HLH for long-term patient management and family genetic counseling.",

            "text": "While anakinra has been successfully utilized in MAS, it has not been formally studied in HLH associated with bonafide mutations. In our patient with two identified UNC13D mutations, anakinra was utilized as an immunomodulator while the diagnosis was evolving. Although the progression of our patient\u2019s disease was not florid while receiving anakinra, there were decreased platelet and neutrophil counts during therapy. However, when anakinra was stopped, there was a clear surge in ferritin levels. It is unclear from our experience if anakinra magnifies certain abnormalities found in primary HLH while moderately quelling others. A more likely explanation is that the anakinra functioned in partially blocking the HLH-associated inflammation in our patient thus allowing for the masking of certain phenotypic associations of HLH such as ferritin, but not others (i.e., platelet counts). While we were not situated to immunologically prove the partial blockade of inflammation in our patient while receiving anakinra, our experience suggests that its use be reserved for the more mild secondary forms of HLH and that therapy of primary HLH be limited to more wide-ranging immunosuppression such as that provided through the HLH-2004 protocol [4,14].",
