Then, we show that the WAR framing is used to talk about specific topics, such as the virus treatment, but not others, such as the effects of social distancing on the population. We then measure and compare the popularity of the WAR frame to three alternative figurative frames (MONSTER, STORM and TSUNAMI) and a literal frame used as control (FAMILY). The results show that while the FAMILY literal frame covers a wider portion of the corpus, among the figurative framings WAR is the most frequently used, and thus arguably the most conventional one. However, we conclude, this frame is not apt to elaborate the discourse around many aspects involved in the current situation. Therefore, we conclude, in line with previous suggestions, a plethora of framing options, or a metaphor menu, may facilitate the communication of various aspects involved in the Covid-19-related discourse on the social media, and thus support civilians in the expression of their feelings, opinions and ideas during the current pandemic.",

In relation to health discourse, tweets have been used by epidemiologists to access supplementary data about epidemics. For example, tweets about particular diseases have been compared to gold-standard incidence data, showing that there are positive correlations between the number of tweets discussing flu-symptoms and official statistics about the virus spread such as those published by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Health Protection Agency [2] . Already a decade ago, in Brazil, tweets have been used to track the spreading of the dengue fever, a mosquito-transmitted virus [3] . More recently, Pruss and colleagues [4] used a topic model applied to a large corpus of tweets to automatically identify and extract the key topics of discussion about the Zika disease, a virus that spread mainly in the Americas in early 2015. The authors found also that rises in 5 PREPRINT -DRAFT VERSION tweeting activity tended to follow major events related to the disease, and Zika-related discussions were moderately correlated with the virus incidence. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the combination of data collected from hospitals about specific diseases, and data collected from social media, can improve surveillance and forecasting about the disease more effectively [5, 6] .",

Vijaykumar and colleagues [13] analysed how content related to Zika disease spreads on Twitter, thanks to tweets amplifiers and retweets. The authors found that, of the 12 themes taken into account, Zika transmission was the most frequently talked about, on Twitter. Finally, Pruss and colleagues [4] mined a corpus of tweets in three different languages (Spanish, Portuguese and English) with a multilingual topic model and identified key topics of discussion across the languages.

In particular, metaphor is often used to talk about different aspects of diseases, such as their treatment, their outbreak and their symptoms. The framing power of metaphor is particularly relevant in health-related discourse, because it has been shown that it can impact patients' general well-being. For example, in a seminal study Sontag [14] criticized the popular use of war metaphors to talk about cancer, a topic of research recently investigated also by Semino and colleagues [15] . As these authors explain, the military metaphor that we tend to use to talk about the development, spreading and cure of cancer inside the human body has been repeatedly rejected by cancer patients as well as by many relatives and doctors, who indicate that such framing provokes anxiety and a sense of helplessness that can have negative implications for cancer patients. In a series of experiments, for example, Hendricks and colleagues [16] found that framing a person's cancer situation within the war metaphor, and therefore as a battle, has the consequence of making people believe that the patient may feel guilty in the case that the treatment does not succeed. Conversely, framing the cancer situation as a journey encourages the inference that the patient will experience less anxiety about her health condition.",

According to Karlberg and Buell [17] 17% of all articles in the Time Magazine published between 1981 and 2000, contained at least one war metaphor. The war metaphor is not used solely to frame the discourse around diseases, but also the discussion 8 PREPRINT -DRAFT VERSION around political campaigns, crime, drugs and poverty. As explained in [1] , war metaphors are pervasive in public discourse and span a wide range of topics because they provide a very effective structural framework for communicating and thinking about abstract and complex topics, notably because of the emotional valence that these metaphors can convey. In the special case of the diseases, the war metaphor is typically used to frame the situation relatively to the treatment of the disease. As indicated in MetaNet, the Berkeley-based structured repository of conceptual metaphors and frames [18] , the metaphor can be formalized as DISEASE The figurative frame of WAR, used in discourses around diseases, is certainly a conventional one, frequently used, often unconsciously. As argued by [1] , such a frame is handy and frequently used because it draws on basic knowledge that everyone has, even though for most people this is not knowledge coming from first hand experience. Moreover, this frame expressed in an exemplary way the urgency associated with a very negative situation, and the necessity for actions to be taken, in order to achieve a final outcome quickly. The outcome can be either positive or negative, in a rather categorical way. The inner structure of the frame is also relatively simple, with opposing forces clearly labelled as in-groups and out-groups, or allied and enemies. Each force has a strategy to achieve a goal, which involves risks and can potentially be lethal. For these reasons, this frame is arguably very well suited to appear in the discourse around Despite the undebatable frequency by which public discourse around diseases uses war metaphors, this frame is often not well received, as mentioned above, and war-related metaphors can be resisted. As we will further elaborate in the Discussion section, in some cases the press opposes deliberately the war frame, advancing alternative figurative frames. Tracking down alternative frames to the war one in a qualitative manner has been a recent endeavor initiated by scholars in cognitive linguistics and corpus analysis, on Twitter. The hashtag #ReframeCovid (first proposed, to the best of our knowledge, by In\u00e9s Olza and Paula Sobrino) has been recently used to harvest texts such as articles, advertisements and notes showing how the virus has been opposed and framed in alternative ways by a few journalists and writers. Notably, the discourse has been reframed using lexical units related to the domain of FOOTBALL, of GAMES, of STORMS and so forth. In Study 3, hereby reported, we explored the structure and functioning of alternative frames too, in our corpus-based analysis of tweets about Covid-19, and compared them to the WAR frame as well as a literal frame, that is the frame of family and friends.",

As an unsupervised learner, LDA needs to be given the number of topics that it will try to divide the data into. Our exploratory approach includes the search space for several different amounts of topics, thus varying in the level of granularity represented within each topic. We hereby report the results obtained from the division of the data into a relatively small number of topics (N=4) and a relatively large number of topics (N= 16), to show and compare a less granular and a more granular division of the data. We expect to find broader and more generic concepts listed in the first analysis (N=4) and more specific concepts in the fine-grained topic analysis (N=16). We have used 6 passes of the algorithm to go over the entire corpus (higher numbers cost more training time, but can improve the topic quality).

We cannot exclude that this tendency may change, once the pandemic moves into a different stage. In particular, it could be the case that when the emergency has passed, and we will move toward the next phase, in which we will leave the peak of the emergency, the most frequent words used in relation to the WAR frame might relate to the identification of strategies to keep ourselves safe and to defend our community from potential new attacks.",

Moreover, tweets that feature war-related words are also often classified within the topics I and III, which include the aspects related to communications and reports about the virus, and politics. We interpret these results arguing that public communications and political messages are likely to frame the discourse in the WAR framing. Finally, it might not come as a surprise the fact that topic II, which encompasses aspects of the discourse related to the familiar sphere, the community and the social compassion, does not relate well with the tweets containing war terms.",

Similarly, topic 10 relates to the diagnostics and treatment of the virus, with words such as \"positive\", \"death\", \"cases\", \"tested\", \"people\", \"confirmed\". Therefore, as the MetaNet WAR metaphor suggests, and as we described in the Theoretical Background of this paper, it is the discourse around the disease treatment and its diagnostics that are likely to be framed figuratively in terms of a war. Conversely, topic 3, which is characterized by words like \"friends\", \"share\", \"trying\", \"family\", \"time\" and therefore addresses intimate social relations and personal affective aspects related to Covid-19, is not related to the WAR frame: tweets addressing these aspects do not employ military lexical units.",

In other words, within each frame there were few words used very frequently, but many words were rarely used. Moreover, although this is not visible on the plot in Fig 6, in the online repository we stored the full list of lexical units within each frame. Among the top ranked ones for the FAMILY frame we found \"home\", \"family\", \"house\", \"children\", \"parents\", \"wife\", \"son\", and \"mom\". For the STORM frame among the most frequently used lexical units we found \"force\", \"disaster\", \"wave\", \"storm\", \"cloud\", and \"waves\".

A more fine-grained analysis brings to light topics related to the treatment of the disease, mentioning people involved in this operation such as doctors and nurses, and topics related to the diagnostics of the virus. In our second study we found that these specific topics appear to be those in which the WAR framing is particularly relevant: most lexical units within the WAR frame are found in tweets that get automatically classified within the specific topics of virus treatment and diagnostics. Moreover, in study 2 we observed that there is a very little number of lexical units related to war that are very frequently used, while the majority of war-related words are not used to frame the discourse around Covid-19. The more frequently used words refer to actions and events, such as \"fighting\", \"fight\", \"battle\", and \"combat\". As we anticipated in study 2, this might be a peculiarity of the stage of the pandemic we are currently living, which is the peak of the emergency. We do not exclude that with the development of the epidemics and the passage to the next phase (i.e., leaving the peak) also the most frequent words used within the WAR frame will change, to exploit new aspects of this frame that are relevant to the new situation. Finally, in study 3 we compared the frequency by which the WAR frame, the FAMILY literal frame and three other figurative frames are used. We found that while the FAMILY literal frame used as control covers a wider portion of the corpus, among the alternative figurative frames analysed (MONSTER, STORM and TSUNAMI), the WAR frame is the most frequently used to talk about Covid-19, and thus, arguably, the most conventional one, as previous literature also suggests.",

However, we have also found that this frame is used specifically to talk about specific aspects of the current epidemic, such as its treatment and diagnostics. Other aspects involved in the epidemic are not typically framed within a WAR. This point is particularly important. The WAR frame, like any other frame, is useful and apt to talk about some aspects of the pandemic, such as the treatment of the virus and the operations performed by doctors and nurses in hospitals, but not to talk about other aspects, such as the need to feel our family close to us, while respecting the social distancing measures, or the collaborative efforts that we should undertake in order to #flattenthecurve, that is, diluting the spreading of the virus over a longer period of time, so that hospitals' ICU departments can work efficiently without getting saturated by incoming patients. In this sense, future studies could focus on the systematic identification of alternative figurative framings actually used in the Covid-19 discourse to tackle different aspects of the epidemic, but could also focus on the generation of additional frames, which can help communities to understand and express aspects of this situation that cannot be expressed by the WAR frame. A collection of different frames and metaphors that tackle different aspects of the current situation, or a Metaphor Menu ( http://wp.lancs.ac.uk/melc/the-metaphor-menu/ ) , as Semino and colleagues proposed in relation to cancer discourse [15] , is arguably the most desirable set of communicative tools that, as language, communication, and computer scientists, we shall aim to construct in these current times, as a service to our communities.",

Therefore, we decided to evaluate two subsets of the term lists for each framing, setting two cutoffs at N=30 and N=50 terms on each list. In this way, we only considered the top 30 and then 50 most relevant (i.e., most frequently used) terms within each frame.

This is not particularly surprising, as previous literature shows that metaphor-related words cover only a PREPRINT -DRAFT VERSION percentage of the discourse, and that literal language is still prevalent. However, we show that in the Covid-19 discourse the WAR frame is particularly well represented, compared to other figurative frames that we operationalized in this set of studies, that is the MONSTER, the STORM and the TSUNAMI, which appeared to be relevant frames associated with the discourse around diseases and viruses according to the Metaphor Magnet.Within the FAMILY (literal) frame, the top words (i.e., most frequent words) that are used in the tweets denote family members and family relations. Within the STORM frame, words that suggest the most frequently used words seem to denote concrete entities that can be typically observed within a storm scenario. In general, from a qualitative observation of the words that belong to these scenarios and appear to be used on Twitter to frame the discourse around Covid-19, it emerges quite clear the fact that different frames are used to tackle different aspects associated with Covid-19. Words in the STORM and in the TSUNAMI frames seem to relate to events and actions associated with the arrival and spreading of the pandemic. Words within the MONSTER framing, instead, are mostly nouns and can be arguably used to frame the discourse about the behavior of the virus, in a rather personified way, which is loaded with emotional content and extremely negative valence. This phenomenon, overall, supports the idea that different frames may be apt to elaborate the discourse around different aspects, related to a topic.In this study we explored the discourse around Covid-19 in its manifestation on Twitter. We addressed three specific research questions:1. What are the topics around which the Twitter discourse revolves, in relation to Covid-19; 2. To what extent the pervasive WAR framing is used to model the Covid-19 discourse on Twitter, and specifically in relation to which topics does this figurative framing emerge; 3. To what extent does the WAR framing compare to other potentially relevant figurative framings related to the discourse on viruses, and to the literal framing FAMILY.",
