Our economic model is designed to address the unique features of the COVID-19 pandemic. Social distancing measures affect both supply and demand, and input-output constraints play a key role in restricting economic output. Standard models for production functions are not adequate to model the short-term effects of lockdown. A survey of industry analysts conducted by IHS Markit allows us to evaluate which inputs for each industry are absolutely necessary for production over a two month period. Our model also includes inventory dynamics and feedback between unemployment and consumption. We demonstrate that economic outcomes are very sensitive to the choice of production function, show how supply constraints cause strong network effects, and find some counter-intuitive effects, such as that reopening only a few industries can actually lower aggregate output. Occupation-specific data and contact surveys allow us to estimate how different industries affect the transmission rate of the disease. We investigate six different re-opening scenarios, presenting our best estimates for the increase in R 0 and the increase in GDP. Our results suggest that there is a reasonable compromise that yields a relatively small increase in R 0 and delivers a substantial boost in economic output. This corresponds to a situation in which all non-consumer facing industries reopen, schools are open only for workers who need childcare, and everyone who can work from home continues to work from home.",

Governments throughout the world are contemplating or implementing measures to ease social distancing and reopen the economy, which may involve a tradeoff between increasing economic output vs. increasing the expected number of deaths due to the pandemic. Here we investigate several scenarios for the phased reopening of the economy. At one extreme, we find that reopening only a very limited number of industries can create supply chain mis-coordination problems that in some cases might actually decrease aggregate output. In contrast, reopening all industries would most likely increase R 0 above 1. We find a good scenario in-between these extremes: reopening a large part of the upstream industries, while consumer-facing industries stay closed, limits supply chain mis-coordination while providing a large boost to output and a relatively small increase in infection rates.",

Some industries are nearly entirely shut down by lack of demand, others are restricted by lack of labor, and many are largely unaffected. Feedback effects amplify the initial shocks. The lack of demand for final goods such as restaurants or transportation propagates upstream, reducing demand for the intermediate goods that supply these industries. Supply constraints due to lack of labor under social distancing propagate downstream, by creating input scarcity that can limit production even in cases where the availability of labor and demand would not have been an issue. The resulting supply and demand constraints interact to create bottlenecks in production. The resulting decreases in production may lead to unemployment, decreasing consumption and causing additional amplification of shocks that further decrease final demand.",

Most of the economic analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic uses relatively aggregate macro models (Eichenbaum et al. 2020 , Bodenstein et al. 2020 , with only a few studies predicting the economic effects using input-output (IO) models. IO models are particularly relevant to evaluate the consequences of crises such as COVID-19, where different sectors are affected differently, and the propagation of shocks through supply chains is likely to amplify the initial effects. Table  1 summarizes the main features of several IO models that have been put forward recently to evaluate the macroeconomic effects of the COVID-19 crisis. Our paper differs in a number of important ways from the literature. On one hand, we provide comprehensive scenarios, an estimation of the epidemic spreading, non-equilibrium dynamics, and explicit demand shocks together with a sophisticated consumption response. On the other hand, we do not model prices, as we argue that price changes during the lockdown are relatively small.",

Essentially, the literature can be ordered by the degree to which the production function allows substitutions between inputs. At one extreme, the Leontief production function assumes a fixed recipe for production, allowing no substitutions and restricting production based on the limiting input (Inoue & Todo 2020) . Under the Leontief production function, if a single input is severely reduced, overall production will be reduced proportionately, even if that input is ordinarily relatively small. This can lead to unrealistic behaviours. For example, the steel industry has restaurants as an input, presumably because steel companies have a workplace canteen and sometimes entertain their clients and employees. A literal application of the Leontief production function would predict that a sharp drop in the output of the restaurant industry will dramatically reduce steel output. This is unrealistic, particularly in the short run.",

Some papers (Baqaee & Farhi 2020 ) consider a nested CES production function, which can accommodate a wide range of technologies. In principle, nests could allow for substitution between some inputs and forbid it between others, in different ways for different industries. However, it is hard to calibrate all these elasticities, so that in practice many models end up using very limited nesting structure or assuming uniform substitutability. Consider again our example of the steel industry. With common calibrations of the (nested) CES production function, firms could substitute iron for energy, while still producing the same output. To the extent that certain production processes are encoded in fixed technological \"recipes\", this is clearly unrealistic 1 .",

In this paper, we mostly keep the basic Leontief assumption that firms cannot substitute one input for another. However, we depart from the Leontief assumption in that we allow firms to keep producing as long as they have the inputs that are absolutely necessary, which we call \"critical inputs\". The steel industry cannot produce steel without iron and energy, but it can operate for a considerable period of time without restaurants or logistics consultants. Specifically, we make the assumption that if restaurants cannot supply the steel industry, the steel industry simply keeps producing at the same rate. This is of course only an approximation. To keep the same example, by not using restaurants, the costs of the steel industry are reduced and, ceteris paribus, its profits increase. In reality, non-critical inputs may have an impact on steel output that could be modeled as a shock to productivity. However, we think that during the short time-scales of the pandemic, these problems are second-order effects, and our production function provides a better assumption than Leontief or CES production functions.",

In this survey they asked \"Can production continue in industry X if input Y is not available for two months?\". The list of possible industries X and Y was drawn from the 55 industries in the World Input-Output Database. This question was presented to 30 different industry analysts who were experts in industry X. Each of them was asked to rate the importance of each of its inputs Y. They assigned a score of 1 if they believed input Y is critical, 0 if it is not critical, and 0.5 if it is in-between, with the possibility of a rating of NA if they could not make a judgement. We then apply the Leontief function to the list of critical inputs, ignoring non-critical inputs. We experimented with several possible treatments for industries with ratings of 0.5 and found that we get somewhat better empirical results by treating them as non-critical (though at present we do not have sufficient evidence to resolve this question unambiguously).",

The vast majority of the literature has focused on the ability to work from home, and some studies incorporate lists of essential vs. inessential industries, but almost no papers have also explicitly added shocks to consumer preferences. (Baqaee & Farhi (2020) is an exception, but the treatment is only theoretical). Here we use the estimates from del Rio-Chanona et al. (2020) , which are taken from a prospective study by the Congressional Budget Office (2006) . These estimates are crude, but we are not aware of estimates that are any better. As we write, data on actual consumption starts to become available; what we have seen so far is qualitatively consistent with the shocks predicted by the CBO, with massive shocks to the hospitality industry, travel and recreation, milder (but large) shocks elsewhere, and increased expenses in groceries/food retail (Andersen et al. 2020 , Carvalho et al. 2020 , Chen et al. 2020 . Besides the initial shock, we also attempt to introduce realistic dynamics for recovery and for savings. The shocks to on-site consumption industries are more long lasting, and savings from the lack of consumption of specific goods and services during lockdown are only partially reallocated to other expenses.",

The difficulty comes with obtaining good estimates of the key parameters that govern the fate of an epidemic, and in particular, the reproduction number R 0 , which gives the number of secondary cases for each primary case in a largely unaffected population. If R 0 is above one, the disease spreads to a given percentage of the population, otherwise the epidemic dies out. In this paper, we side-track the problem of developing a full-fledged epidemic spreading model, and focus on estimating R 0 . We decompose the reproduction number into the infections caused by contacts during work, during consumption, during public transport, and in other contexts, i.e. home and other social interactions. We use recent contact survey data from Sweden to estimate the share of infection due to each type of contact. For each industry we estimate its relative contribution to overall work and consumption infections. For instance, the Health sector is responsible for more work-related infections than the Forestry sector. This is because workers have more contacts, contacts are more risky, and there are more Health workers than Forestry workers. As another example, the Retail and Restaurant sectors contribute much more to consumption infections than the Mining sector, because there are virtually no direct consumption activities in the Mining industry.",

We find that a two-month lockdown has a strong impact on the economy, with gross output, value added, and consumption decreased by 26%, 25%, and 18%, respectively, compared to the UK pre-lockdown levels. Compared to the economy's performance before the lockdown, an additional month of lockdown would decrease GDP from 75% to 74%, while re-opening only the Manufacturing and Construction sectors would increase GDP from 75% to 76% in a month. Re-opening all sectors except those that are consumer-facing would increase GDP to 82% of its pre-lockdown value, i.e. in a month it would increase GDP by 8 percentage points with respect to the lockdown scenario. Opening all industries only adds an additional 2% boost to GDP. Note that the scenario with all industries open has only 84% of pre-lockdown GDP. This is due to a combination of a persistent depression in demand for industries like restaurants (even if they are open) and the fact that consumer expectations take time to recover. Figure 1 : How different policy scenarios affect R0 and economic output. The coloured bars show the expected reproduction number of the epidemic for each policy scenario. Different colours designate the activities that cause the epidemic to spread. The purple bars denote the percentage increase in value added relative to lockdown a month after the economy is opened under each scenario. Black lines are two standard deviation error bars. Note that we have normalized the infection rates for all scenarios so that they correspond to the Jarvis et al. (2020) study during lockdown. (Our estimate during lockdown is roughly R0 \u2248 0.90; their estimate is 0.62; these agree with the error bars).

In contrast, as soon as schools are open R 0 rises dramatically, and is very likely greater than one. If the economy is fully reopened, the predicted rise in R 0 is very likely substantially greater than one. Note that when the economy is fully reopened we find an R 0 still disturbingly greater than one, although much lower than the pre-lockdown value, as we assume that work from home continues and non-work related social distancing measures continue. Another reason for this is that we renormalize all our epidemiological results by the factor of 0.62/0.90, corresponding to the ratio of our original estimate to that of Jarvis et al. (2020) for the lockdown situation, thus ensuring that our estimate for the lockdown scenario corresponds to theirs. We did this because we feel that the relative values of our estimated R 0 across different scenarios are more reliable than the absolute values, and we defer to professional epidemiologists for estimating the absolute values. It is important to bear in mind that all these values are uncertain, and the uncertainties potentially make the difference in determining whether there will be a second wave of the epidemic in the UK. We should also stress the uncertainties in the economic results -as we will show here, they depend rather sensitively on assumptions about the production function.",

Modeling the severeness of intermediate input constraints realistically requires an understanding of how critical inputs are in the production of a given industry (Barrot & Sauvagnat 2016) . We use the ratings of IHS Markit analysts to differentiate three types of inputs: critical, important and non-critical inputs (Appendix C). If an industry runs out of critical inputs, economic production halts immediately. Conversely, if an industry runs out of non-critical inputs, we assume that economic production is not affected. We also have ratings on important but not critical inputs. As a baseline we treat important inputs as non-critical.

Moreover, the predictions also take into account whether an industry is essential in the sense that it needs to continue operating during a lockdown. The predictions of first-order shocks are based on the US economy using a different industrial classification system. These predictions therefore need to be adopted for the UK economy and the WIOD industry classification as we outline in detail in Appendix A.",

When the lockdown starts, there is a sudden drop in economic activity, shown by a sharp decrease in production. A second smaller drop in production occurs at the beginning of April, due to some service sectors further reducing production. Throughout the simulation, however, service sectors tend to perform better than manufacturing, trade, transport and accommodation sectors. The main reason is that most service sectors face both lower supply and demand shocks, as a high share of workers can effectively work from home, and there is no on-site consumption for most business and professional services.

Spain, France, and Italy have reported a larger effect. Remarkably, recently released data from statistical offices reveals that all these countries expect a decline in GDP of around 5% in 2020-Q1, which is substantially larger than the 2% reduction in the UK. Since this is mostly due to these countries starting widespread lockdowns between one and two weeks earlier than the UK, we rerun our model starting lockdown on March 15. In this case, we find that quarterly GDP decreases by 3.3%. This is somewhat off the 5% mark, but part of the error probably comes from the fact that we calibrate our model on UK data (e.g. IO tables), and we assume no reduction in GDP at all before March 15 (in contrast to the evidence of disruptions in supply chains, reduced international travel and early reaction by some consumers prior to this date).",

However, we want to test the predictions of our model at a detailed sectoral level, and also explore how our model fares deeper into the lockdown period. The best sectoral data that we could find were released by the States of Washington and Texas, which released weekly unemployment claims data at a high level of industrial disaggregation. In particular, Washington released data up to 6-digit NAICS, while Texas released data for 17 broad industries. 18 To compare with the predictions of our model, we make the hypothesis that Figure 5 : Comparison of model predictions to data. In both panels, on both axes, we show the ratio between employment 42 (Washington) or 35 (Texas) days after the shock and employment before the shock. Dots are scaled according to employment shares. The dots labels refer to industry codes, see Appendix for the corresponding names. The identity line is shown for reference. relative reductions in employment across different sectors are similar in the UK as in Washington and Texas; for example, restaurant workers are more likely to be fired or furloughed than workers in food manufacturing in all these places. We consider unemployment claims from March 14 through April 25 for Washington, and through April 18 for Texas. While March 14 was not the official start of lockdown for either State, unemployment claims started to spike during that week, making it the ideal starting point to compare the predictions of our model to data. To run the model for the same time span as the data, we run it for 42 days after imposing lockdown to compare to Washington data, and for 35 days for Texas data. Figure 5 shows the ratio of employment levels on April 25 to employment levels on March 14, both in the model and in the Washington data, across all sectors. The Pearson correlation between the model's predictions and the data is 0.44, and the correlation weighted by the employment share of each sector is 0.66. This indicates that predictions for the largest sectors are more accurate. In most cases the model somewhat overestimates the reduction in employment. However, in a few cases employment reduction is actually underestimated, for example in health (Q, large dot on the right).",

            "text": "Why is it that turning off demand shocks leads to larger adverse overall impacts? The reason is that in case of large supply constraints and no reduction in final demand, there is higher competition for relatively few goods. If producers cannot satisfy aggregate demand, they need to ration their output to customers (recall that we use proportional rationing). In case of large aggregate demand every customer receives only a relatively small share, which could be even less for some industries compared to the scenario where demand shocks are turned on. If these goods are critical inputs, production in concerned industries will come down once inventories of these inputs are run down. Thus, removing demand shocks can increase the risk of input bottlenecks in production. Put simply, decreasing final demand of some key intermediate goods ensures continued supply of these intermediate goods to other intermediate industries.",

As an illustrative example in Fig. 9 b) , we show how production constraints in Manufacturing Electronic (C26) lead to larger input bottlenecks in IT (J62-3) in the absence of initial demand shocks. There is no difference in Manufacturing Electronic production (black line) for both scenarios due to binding capacity constraints, but it faces larger aggregate demand if there are no demand shocks (blue crosses) compared to both shocks being present (red crosses). Thus, sector IT for which Manufacturing Electronic goods are critical inputs has to run down its input inventories quicker if there are no demand shocks (blue dashed line), since sector Manufacturing Electronic can deliver less goods in this case. This is reflected in total output of IT. If there are no demand shocks present, IT production is higher for the first few time steps (blue solid line), but drops below the baseline production of both supply and demand shocks (red solid line). We observe similar dynamics for other industries as well. Comparing normalized production at the sectoral level two weeks after lockdown when supply and demand shocks are turned on (x-axis) and with demand shocks turned off (y-axis). A few large sectors achieve substantially less production if there are no initial demand shocks in the economy. Right panel: A sectoral example of downstream shock propagation of the \"Baseline\" and \"Only supply shocks\" scenarios in Fig. 8 The case of Manufacturing Electronic production and the coupled output of the IT sector exemplifies the complexity of shock propagation through production networks. We highlight several striking features of this analysis which tend to be entirely neglected in most macroeconomic studies, even if they incorporate industry-specific effects. First, the specification of production functions and input criticality plays an important role. Most economic analyses use some form of CES production functions with non-zero substitution coefficients. Under this approach, while it is in principle possible to construct elaborated CES nests where different degrees of substitutability are allowed between different inputs of a given sector (Baqaee & Farhi 2020) , in practice it is so hard to calibrate the parameters that only one (Barrot & Sauvagnat 2016) or a few (Baqaee & Farhi 2020 , Bonadio et al. 2020 ) parameters are specified. None of the recent IO papers have considered different degrees of substitution between groups of intermediate inputs. The survey considered here (Appendix C) instead introduces a distinction between critical and non-critical inputs, for each separate industry, allowing us to keep the Leontief assumption of a strong lack of substitutability for critical inputs, which is arguably a key feature of short-run dynamics after large shocks, while at the same time not allowing some non-critical inputs to prevent production. This is a step toward more realism, as in exceptional circumstances like a pandemic, we believe that it is likely that firms can still operate even if several inputs that they usually use are not available. Of course, this is admittedly imperfect and could be improved, and we have made the strong assumption that the lack of use a non-critical input simply does not decrease production and translate into higher profits. Assuming a drop in productivity in this case would change the quantitative results, but would not, however, fundamentally change the dynamics.",

It can take days to weeks for shocks to cascade through several layers of a large production network and our simulations suggest that it can take months until the dynamics reach a steady state. Moreover, the presence of input bottlenecks due to the lack of critical inputs can amplify initial shocks in highly nonlinear ways (see Appendix D.1). The propagation of shocks is path-dependent. This is due to the fact that different industries can have very different customers, resulting in heterogeneous contagion dynamics that depend on \"who gets hit first\". General equilibrium models and most input-output models implicitly assume zero adjustment time and compare pre-and post-shock equilibrium states of the economy to quantify overall impacts. Our analysis suggests that the shock propagation dynamics play an important role in the short time horizons of pandemic lockdowns. In other words, equilibrium comparative static is warranted only when adjustment is faster than the arrival of new shock (Ando et al. 1963 ). This is not the case currently, where the lifting of the lockdown happens before the system has had a chance to reach the lockdown steady-state.",

Let us first consider the Leontief production function (left panels). Here, we find a huge increase in economic activity if the highly upstream primary sectors (Agriculture and Mining) are re-opened. Note that primary sectors only account for 2% of UK's total economic output. Opening primary sectors has much smaller effects when using the baseline production function, where inputs are only partially critical, and the linear production function, where inputs are are not critical at all. When re-opening the much larger manufacturing sectors (15% of total output), we obtain a completely different impact on economic output. Strikingly, we find for a Leontief production function that economic output can be lower if manufacturing sectors are opened. The reason is similar to why smaller aggregate shocks can lead to larger overall impacts as discussed in Fig 8. Manufacturing is a large sector relying on many inputs which are critical inputs for other sectors too. Production constraints in other industries might render it impossible to provide larger amounts of those inputs. If manufacturing sectors are re-opened, competition for those scarce inputs increases, resulting in less intermediate consumption for non-manufacturing industries which might face input bottlenecks as a consequence. We do not observe this for the alternative production function setups which relax the strong Leontief assumption. Here, economic output increases by 2-3 percentage points.",

This is because these are highly downstream industries and their economic output is of little significance for the intermediate consumption of other industries. Thus, opening recreational sectors has mostly demand-side effects, and given the capacity constraints of upstream sectors this extra demand cannot be satisfied, resulting in no change in overall production.

When R 0 < 1, the outbreak is minimal, but when R 0 \u2265 1, the outbreak reaches a finite proportion of the population, and larger R 0 implies a larger final number of individuals infected.",

While we also want to distinguish home-based and work-based contacts, in the context of reopening industries a key question is that of consumption-based infections (Eichenbaum et al. 2020) . For instance, reopening cinemas would pose a threat to people working in cinemas, but the number of consumers attending cinemas is vastly larger than the number of workers. Thus, data on the number of contacts at work would fail to capture this risk. We decompose \u03b2 into five sources of infection: infections at the workplace (\u03b2 w ), infections at school (\u03b2 s ), infections during consumption activities (\u03b2 c ), infections during commuting (\u03b2 T ) and infections that are not influenced by whether or not an industry is open (for short, \"home\" infections \u03b2 h ).

Conversely, there is not a large benefit in terms of production from opening consumer-facing industries. To compute the increases in production in Figure 1 , we consider the first 30 days after lockdown is lifted; as it is easy to see, the economy is far from completely recovering after 30 days, as discussed in Section 4.",

Since we do not consider productivity decrease due to childcare work, the GDP of Scenario IV is equal to the GDP in Scenario III.

First, we have shown that input criticality plays an important role in the downstream amplification of shocks. Second, we found that inventory levels can act as buffers against production shocks and are crucial for understanding economic impacts -an aspect usually neglected in other studies. Third, it has become evident that time scales matter as shock propagation is not immediate but takes time. Overall, we find that first-order shocks can be translated into overall impacts in highly nonlinear ways. We even find cases where smaller aggregate shocks can lead to larger economic impacts as a result of unbalanced supply and demand dynamics. This 'coordination failure' suggests that it could be dangerous to re-open single sectors of the economy by themselves without understanding how they are embedded in the production network. Our results suggest that the economic boost from opening an industry depends on the up-/downstream location of that industry as well as how severe the economy suffers from input bottlenecks. In case the economy faces serious productive constraints, reopening a single sector can even have adverse effects on economic output.",

To help understand this we develop an epidemic model where the infection rate is divided between different economic-related activities: work, schools, consumption, transport, and others. Within work and consumption, we consider the relative risk of infection between industries. We find that there is little variance between the risk of infection workers face in different industries. In contrast, the risk of infection due to consumption is concentrated in three consumer-facing industries: retail, restaurants and hotels, and other services (including gym and entertainment events). Our results show that keeping consumer-facing industries and schools closed, and having people who can telework work from home can significantly increase the economic output while having a relatively small increase in the spread of the epidemic.

Among other things, we show that these ratios are remarkably stable over time. We take this evidence as supporting the idea that inventory to sales ratios are fundamental concepts that have to do with the nature of production rather than with specificities of the US economy.

We use information from table 208, as, according to the BEA, \"underlying detail\" tables such as 2BU may be less accurate. 24 The latest available data (2019Q4) are reported in Table 7 , where we also report monthly gross output and the ratio between the level of inventories and monthly gross output.

As alternative we also consider a simpler consumption function where consumers demand simply a fixed portion of their current income (i.e. have a fixed marginal propensity to consume) which for brevity we call \"Keynesian\" consumption function. As an even simpler specification we also consider a fixed consumption function where consumers demand a fixed portion of their initial income. For the two alternative consumption functions we choose marginal propensities to consume equal to one such that all of present or initial income is consumed. Model results for alternative consumption function specifications are shown in Fig. 20 . There are only negligible differences between different production functions on gross output and labor compensation. Realized consumption is slightly higher for a fixed consumption function which is not surprising and somewhat artificially achieved since here consumers demand based on comparatively large initial income values.",

We find almost no differences on gross output and realized consumption for all these cases. In line with intuition the exact specification of hiring and firing affects labor compensation and firms' profits. In case of no hiring and firing, labor compensation remains constant throughout the simulation, once the initial labor supply shock is applied. Labor compensation is smaller the easier it is for firms to fire (and hire) employees. This makes sense since firms which face production constraints other than capacity constraints will lay off employees, reducing overall labor income. The picture is reversed for profits. If there is no flexibility for firms in adjusting labor input, there is a larger negative impact on profits.

            "text": "A First-order economic shocks and work context industry variables A.1 NAICS-WIOD mapping of shocks Due to the COVID-19 pandemic industries experience supply-side reductions due to the closure of non-essential industries and workers not being able to perform their activities at home. Many industries also face substantial reductions in demand. del Rio-Chanona et al. (2020) provide quantitative predictions of these first-order supply and demand shocks for the US economy. To calculate supply-side predictions, del Rio-Chanona et al. (2020) classified industries as essential or non-essential and constructed a Remote Labor Index, which measures the ability of different occupations to work from home. Under the assumption that the distribution of occupations across industries and that the percentage of essential workers within an industry is the same for the US and the UK, we can map the supply-shocks estimated by del Rio-Chanona et al. (2020) into the UK economy as follows. First, we build a crosswalk from the NAICS 4-digit industry classification to the classification system used in WIOD, which is a mix of ISIC 2-digit and 1-digit codes. We build this crosswalk using the NAICS to ISIC 2-digit crosswalk from the European Commission and then aggregating the 2-digit codes that are presented as 1-digit in the WIOD classification system. We then do an employment-weighted aggregation of the supply shocks from del Rio-Chanona et al. (2020) for the 277 industries at the NAICS 4-digit classification level to the 55 industries in the WIOD classification. Some of the 4-digit NAICS industries map into more than one WIOD industry classification. When this happens we assume employment is split uniformly among the WIOD industries the NAICS industry maps into. Finally, we make one modification to deal with imputed rents for the Real Estate Sector. Imputed rents account for 69% of the monetary value of the sector 21 . We assume that the supply shock does not affect imputed rents for the Real State Sector and thus consider that the supply shock only affects 31% of the sector. With this modification the final supply shock to the Real Estate Sector is 15%.For calibrating consumption demand shocks, we use the same data as del Rio-Chanona et al. (2020) which are based on the Congressional Budget Office (2006) estimates. These estimates are available only on the more aggregate 2-digit NAICS level which are straightforward to map into WIOD ISIC categories. Table 5 gives an overview of all first-order shocks applied to WIOD industries.A.2 Essential score, remote labor index, and industries' work context Using the same methodology as before, i.e., doing a crosswalk from NAICS-4 digit to the classification system used in WIOD and using employment shares to aggregate, we map the essential score and remote labor index computed in del Rio-Chanona et al. (2020) into the WIOD list of industries. We use these industry remote labor index and essential score at the WIOD industry classification level to estimate the number of people working in each industry for each scenario i.e., to estimate \u03b4 iw (t).O*NET provides different Work Context 22 indices for occupations, including \"Exposure to disease and infection\" and \"Physical proximity\", for brevity we refer to these indexes as exposure show how often an industry has been rated as critical (score=1), half-critical (score=0.5) or non-critical (score=0) input for other industries, or how often the input was rates as NA. Columns under Industry-based rankings give how often an input has been rated as with 1, 0.5, 0 or NA for any given industry. Column n indicates the number of analysts who have rated the inputs of any given industry. Industry T uses no inputs and is therefore not rated. share of labor income used to consume final domestic goods \u03bet fraction of pre-pandemic labor income that households expect to retain in the long-run \u03be L t fraction of pre-pandemic labor income that households expect to retain in the long-run during the lockdown x cap i,t industry production capacity based on available labor x inp i,t industry production capacity based on available inputs ",
