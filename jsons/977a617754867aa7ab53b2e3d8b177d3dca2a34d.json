            "text": "The transboundary diseases in camel are mainly linked to the regional camel meat market from Sahelian countries (from Mauritania to Somalia) to the Arabian peninsula and North Africa. Indeed, the camel flow in relationship with this market is based on live animals' export. Because the camel trade can be formal and informal with interconnections between both sectors and despite veterinary controls in the main exporting ports, some diseases such as Rift Valley fever (RVF), PPR-like disease, and MERS-coronavirus can spread from exporting countries to importing ones. However, the epidemiological status of these different diseases is quite variable and the transmission to humans in case of zoonosis (RVF and MERS-Cov) is not necessarily due to transboundary camel trade despite the impact of outbreak on the regional camel market. Globally, dromedary camel is less affected than other ruminants by infectious diseases under transboundary surveillance. But, because camel breeding is concentrated in countries where the disease surveillance systems often lack means, where the frontiers in desert areas are often \"porous,\" and where the herd mobility is difficult to assess, the risk of transboundary diseases' transmission through borders is not negligible. Nowadays, the challenge of TADs control is limited to Rift Valley fever, but special attention must be paid to emerging diseases, including the recent discovery of prion disease in Algeria.",

This mobility can be pendular (transhumance) or random (nomadism) based on short or long distance. For example, the mobility of Afar tribes across the border between Ethiopia and Djibouti is based on short distance (Faye 1994) . In reverse, the movement of camel herds in Chad can be of a large amplitude from North Chad up to beyond RCA (Central African Republic) border (Aubague et al. 2011 ). Thus, the transboundary camel herd moving is not necessary linked to the distance of the cameleers' camp to the border. However, the potential risk for disease spread increases with the covered distance, the cohabitation between animals of different origins (and different species) occurring mainly around water point (Photo 6.1) throughout the transhumance route.",

            "text": "Contrary to camel milk, essentially limited to local or national market, camel meat is the object of transboundary trade based on living animals. The camel population in the world estimated to 35 million heads (FAOstat 2019) is probably underestimated (Faye and Bonnet 2012) due to the difficulties of census for a mobile species and the absence of official vaccination. So, it is difficult to assess the exact percentage of camels involved in such transboundary trade. The camel flow in relation to the living camel export is consequently also underestimated. In Sahelian region, the camel flow for export is mainly from South to North. Camels in Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Chad, Sudan, and Ethiopia are the main exporting countries of living camels to North Africa (Morocco but overall Libya, Egypt, and Algeria to a lesser extent) and to the Arabian peninsula . For example, the slaughtering rate which is around 7% at world level reaches 95% in Egypt, 75% in Saudi Arabia, 50% in Emirates, and 31% in Morocco and Libya which shows the importance of imports for the national camel meat markets. In reverse, less than 5% of the camels are slaughtered in Sahelian countries for their local demand. Probably, this percentage is also underestimated due to a large part of slaughtering occurring in the remote pastoral area, not included in the official data (Aklilu 2002) . Along the Red Sea, some ports (Port-Sudan, Djibouti, Hargeisa, Mogadishu) are hubs for camel export by boat to Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, and Emirates. In Western and Central Africa, the export is achieved by land, sometimes using trucks but overall by foot as the \"forty-days road\" from El-Obeid (Sudan) to Aswan (Egypt) through the Nubian Desert. If the main flow is South-North (Africa) or South-South (Horn of Africa), recently new flows occurred from the same Sahelian countries to coastal countries like Senegal (coming from Mauritania) or Nigeria (coming from Niger and Chad). Indeed, the recent demand for camel meat for dietetic reason (camel meat is poor in cholesterol and has a high protein value) or even for supposed virtues (it is believed that camel meat is aphrodisiac and cures hypertension) is increasing significantly in these countries (Kurtu 2004; Kadim et al. 2008; Raiymbek et al. 2015) .",

Such a gap is because only a part of the camel flow is passing through official way (Belachew 2005; Alary and Faye 2016) . In Somalia, for example, only 10% of the exported animals would use formal trade. This low part could be explained partly by insecurity along the export routes, especially since the Somalo-Ethiopian war in 1977 and the civil war in Somalia since the 1990s. Indeed, Somalia was the most important camel exporting country all along the twentieth century, and the Horn of Africa represents more than 60% of the estimated camel world population. The pivotal role of Somalia in this regional camel trade started at the end of the nineteenth century; the Somali pastoral area (that covered the eastern part of Ethiopia, northern part of Kenya, and central and northern part of Somalia) established a well-functioning market chain to supply the Brittany garnison established at Aden in 1839. The international trade was extended to include the Persian areas and the boarders of the Indian continent (Djama 1999) . The economic boom of the Arabian peninsula with the development of \"oil era\" stimulated the demand for camel meat and the transboundary camel trade in the region.",

Later, other outbreaks occurred, in 1998, 2002-2003, and 2010 (in the North of the country) and in 2012, all over the country (El-Mamy et al. 2011 , 2014 . The last outbreak was probably started by a sick dromedary camel, slaughtered by the owner before it died, but causing the deaths of several contaminated people with intestinal and hemorrhagic symptoms (El-Mamy et al. 2014). The virus being probably introduced through affected camels transported by truck in grazing areas, the risk of spreading all along the export routes could be high. However, thanks to the rapid appropriate control measures (restriction of livestock movement, re-allocation of locust control teams for mass insecticide spraying, risk communication, and public awareness campaigns) by the veterinary and public health authorities, the spread of the virus was limited, although the fall of the livestock's price (up to 40% decrease) created an attractive opportunity for the traders. Yet, the risk of transboundary dissemination to North African countries having similar ecosystem and rainfall conditions is high. Such epidemiological risk encouraged, since 2000, the creation of the Mauritanian Network for the Epidemio-surveillance of Animal Diseases (REMEMA) under the OIE rules and supported by FAO. This network, based on \"sentinel herds,\" has made it possible to control the international exchanges of camels during the outbreaks.",

The virus is endemic in Egypt and Sudan due to the favorable ecosystems for the vectors (Aradaib et al. 2013; Sayed-Ahmed et al. 2015) . Outbreaks were also described in Kenya and Somalia. All species are affected including camel. It is by animal export that the virus reached the Arabian peninsula for the first time in 2000, affecting Saudi Arabia and Yemen. During this outbreak, around 40,000 animals including sheep, goats, cattle, and camels died, whereas about 10,000 of them aborted (Al-Afaleq and Hussein 2011). The main species imported in the Arabian peninsula from the Horn of Africa are sheep and camel. In consequence, restrictions on livestock movement were imposed by Saudi Arabia (1998 to 2000, 2001 to 2004, and 2007) due to health issues in the Horn of Africa and insufficient veterinary control (Faye 2003; Hassan et al. 2014 ) which landed pastoralists in economic crisis (Pratt et al. 2005) and disturbed the camel trade (Antoine-Moussiaux et al. 2012) . Control and surveillance system was implemented based on the FAO/OIE recommendations: syndromic surveillance (abortion, mortality of the young animals, presence of vectors), participatory surveillance (semi-structured interview of pastoralists), and risk-based surveillance (risk mapping, climatic factors surveillance) in order to identify epidemiological indicators and establish an early warning system. The system is completed by laboratory analyses for confirmation of the disease.",

This disease was characterized by febrile attacks, highly contagious respiratory syndrome with high morbidity (up to 90%), and mortality varying from 5 to 70% depending on the herd and treatment administered (Roger et al. 2000) . The high prevalence of peste des petits ruminants (PPR) in the zone as well as symptoms like those of rinderpest suggested the presence of morbillivirus (Roger et al. 2001) . Similar observations were published in Sudan (Khalafalla et al. 2005) where several mortal epizooties have been reported in the early 2000s, as well as in Kenya, without clearly identifying the causal agent although PPR virus was suspected. The pastoralists of these countries considered those diseases as new ones and attributed to them vernacular names, e.g., Firaanfir, Laaba, or Yudleye (Khalafalla et al. 2010) . The outbreak, however, was apparently confined in the Horn of Africa and has moved throughout the borders of the region in relation to herd mobility, but probably not exported to camel importing countries.",

MERS-Cov seropositivity and percentages of MERS-Cov RNA-positive camels were not more important in the two major Saudi camel import entrance ports of Jeddah and Gizan where an increased likelihood of contacts between imported dromedary camels from the Horn of Africa and local Saudi Arabian dromedary camels was expected. Finally, MERS-Cov prevalence appeared higher in local Saudi camels compared to those imported from Somalia or Sudan (Sabir et al. 2016) . Recent investigations revealed the presence of two lineages of sub-Saharan MERS-Cov, genetically distinct from virus found in Saudi camels. Moreover, it is stated that the MERS-Cov is poorly transmissible from camels to humans, and clinical human MERS disease is not proportional to potential exposure of humans to virus circulation in camels (Hemida et al. 2014 ). According to certain authors (Younan et al. 2016) , the control measures of Saudi camels should be a priority to those imported from the Horn of Africa. Indeed, the control of an endemic coronavirus infection among nomadic tribes in Africa appears unrealistic. Moreover, the lack of human cases in Egypt or Libya who also import many camels from Sudan or Somalia seems to indicate that control system of the disease based only on the trade restriction is not necessarily efficient in the case of Saudi Arabia. However, it is probably different in camel countries \"MERS-Cov free\" as in Central Asia or Australia (Miguel et al. 2016) . Besides, the World Health Organization does not recommend trade restrictions in relation to MERS but advocates for persons at risk (immune-depressed) to avoid close contact with camels (Mackay and Arden 2015) .",

These symptoms occurred in 3.1% of dromedaries brought at Ouargla abattoir in 2015-2016. The diagnosis was confirmed by detecting prion protein in brain tissues from three symptomatic animals. Prion detection in lymphoid tissues is suggestive of the infectious nature of the disease. The potential risks for human and animal health are not yet assessed.
