Additionally, when laboratory animals are used as models for infectious disease studies, exposure to microbial pathogens presents a threat to human health. Also, with the recognition of emerging diseases, some of which are zoonotic, constant vigilance and surveillance of laboratory animals for zoonotic diseases are still required.",

At least 14 viruses are recognized in the genus, and the severity of the disease produced depends on the virulence of the virus involved (LeDuc, 1987; Schmaljohn and Hjelle, 1997). Viruses producing HFRS are prevalent in southeastern Asia, Japan, and focally throughout Eurasia; whereas variants producing a less severe form of the disease, known as nephropathia endemica, occur throughout Scandinavia, Europe, and western portions of the former Soviet Union. An outbreak of hantavirus infection resulting in numerous deaths in adults from fatal hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) was first recognized in the United States (Schmaljohn and Hjelle, 1997; CDCP-NIH, 1999). Since this initial outbreak, cases of HPS have been reported from 30 states, and about three-quarters of the patients have been from rural areas.",

This agent shared 87% identity with the Whitewater Arroyo prototype strain isolated from Neotoma albigula (white-throated wood rats) in New Mexico in 1990, and one of these patients had cleaned rodent excreta in her home during the 2 weeks prior to illness. In parallel with the persistent and emerging importance of arenaviruses for humans with wild rodent contact, LCMV has remained an important natural infection of laboratory animals (Bowen et al., 1975; Dykewicz et al., 1992; Jahrling and Peters, 1992; Rousseau et al., 1997).",

Early serological studies indicated that the same, or a closely related virus, was involved in five of six outbreaks studied and that the etiologic agent had a close antigenic relationship with LCMV (Stevensen et al., 1990, 1991). Subsequently, LCMV was shown to be the etiologic agent for callitrichid hepatitis through cDNA genome analysis (Stevensen et al., 1995). Rodent infestations are common in zoos, and mice, as known carriers of LCMV, are the probable source of infection in these outbreaks. Moreover, it had been a common practice in some facilities to supplement the diets of tamarins and marmosets with suckling mice (Richter et al., 1984), a prime source for the infectious agent. Two veterinarians involved in the care of infected callitrichids became seropositive to the agent but did not develop clinical signs of disease (Adams, 1995). Nevertheless, the wide geographic distribution of the outbreaks of callitrichid hepatitis underscores the need to better understand the public health implications of LCMV as a human pathogen as well.",

Open wire cages were correlated with the highest rate of infection, whereas deep boxes and aquariums were associated with a lower human infection rate. Similarly, cage placement in an area of high human activity was associated with infection, but remotely located cages away from areas of frequent human activity (e.g., the basement) did not result in infection of occupants (Biggar et al., 1975).

Prevention of this disease in the laboratory is achieved through the periodic serological surveillance of new animals with inadequate disease profiles and resident animal colonies at risk, using ELISA and IFA tests. Screening all tumors and cell lines intended for animal passage for the presence of LCMV is another crucial element in the program to prevent the introduction of LCMV into established animal colonies. The elimination of ectoparasites and insect vectors in animal facilities as part of the overall scheme for disease prevention and control would also be prudent measures for the control of LCMV.",

In macaques, B virus produces a mild clinical disease similar to human H. simplex virus infection. During primary infection, macaques develop lingual and/or labial vesicles or ulcers that generally heal within a 1- to 2-week period; keratoconjunctivitis or corneal ulcer may also be noted. The virus persists latently in the trigeminal and genital ganglia of the macaque, and reactivation of viral shedding from peripheral sites in asymptomatic animals subjected to physical or psychological stressors or treated with immunosuppressive agents is known to occur. The infection is transmitted between macaques by virus-laden secretions through close contact involving primarily the oral, conjunctival, and genital mucous membranes (Weigler et al., 1995).",

Seroconversion to B virus among wild-caught rhesus monkeys also indicates that eventually 100% of the newly trapped individuals acquire the infection. Consequently, B virus should be considered endemic among Asian monkeys of the genus Macaca unless these animals have been obtained from specific breeding colonies known to be B virus-free. Several species of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys other than macaques are known to succumb to fatal B virus infection, but only macaques are known to harbor B virus naturally (Holmes et al., 1995). Eight of 25 langurs and 4 of 6 proboscis monkeys were seropositive to B virus in a survey, indicating that these Asian Old World monkey species may also be potential reservoirs (Kalter et al., 1997).",

Additional provisions for protection against B virus exposure via ocular splash were adopted following the death of a young woman exposed by this route (CDCP, 1998). Readers should refer to these sources or other detailed reviews before engaging in studies involving macaques or developing institutional programs for the prevention and control of B virus among monkey handlers (Adams, 1995; Holmes et al., 1995). Briefly, these recommendations emphasize the need for nonhuman primate handlers to conform fully with a written comprehensive personal protective equipment (PPE) program based on a thorough hazard assessment of all work procedures, potential routes of exposure, and potential adverse health outcomes (CDCP, 1998). Approaches to hazard assessment and the development of occupational health and safety programs for research animal facilities have been reviewed extensively in other sources (Committee on Occupational Health and Safety in Research Animal Facilities, 1997). Protective clothing, including leather gloves or long-sleeved garments for hand and arm protection and protective goggles designed for splash protection, along with a mask, are considered essential equipment to protect other mucous membranes from exposure to macaque secretions. The use of a face shield is insufficient as the sole method for protection against ocular exposure because droplet splashes to the head may drain into the eyes and infectious materials may enter via the gap along the margins of the shield. Importantly, personal eyeglasses are not considered PPE. The use of latex gloves alone for hand protection should be reserved for the handling of monkeys under full chemical restraint. Chemical restraint or specialized restraining devices should be used whenever possible for nonhuman primates to reduce personnel injuries.",

Among the rodent and lagomorph species maintained in the laboratory, the wild-caught groundhog and rabbit appear to represent a risk of transmitting rabies (Childs et al., 1997; Karp et al., 1999). However, because the incidence of rabies in wildlife in the United States has risen, the possibility of rabies transmission to dogs, cats, or other species having uncertain vaccination histories and originating from an uncontrolled environment must be considered. In addition, rabies-susceptible wildlife species studied in the field or introduced into the laboratory for special research investigations could also have the potential to harbor rabies virus. In the skunk and some bat species, rabies virus strains appear to have adapted to growth in the lung, producing respiratory tract infections, and the virus is spread via the aerosol route (Johnson, 1989). Of the human cases of rabies in the United States reported since 1990, most have involved bat-associated viral variants; and the predominant strain has been associated with two insectivorous bat species, Eastern pipistrelle bats (Pipistrellus subflavus) and silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans) (CDCP, 1999). Another rabieslike lyssavirus causing fatal human encephalitis has also been recently isolated from bats in Australia, a country believed to have a rabies-free status, further emphasizing the bat as a potential reservoir for these agents (Anonymous, 1997; Gerrard, 1997).",

General guidelines for proper administration of rabies postexposure prophylaxis (RPEP) treatments have been published by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Guidelines stipulate that unvaccinated persons potentially exposed to rabies should be treated with human rabies immune globulin and a 5-dose series of rabies vaccine administered (CDCP, 1999). Surprisingly, one study suggests that the use of RPEP is often inappropriate (Moran et al., 2000). The authors urge the routine use of current published guidelines, physician education, and improved coordination with public health officials. The control of rabies through vaccination programs, animal control measures, and rabies surveillance efforts is an equally important factor in the prevention of rabies cases in the domestic animal population and therefore in humans. Whenever possible, animals brought into the laboratory should have histories that preclude their exposure to rabies or assure that they have been vaccinated for this disease. However, due to the potential for a long incubation in the natural history of the disease, the types of animal models utilized, or the prospect of vaccination failures, most institutions are likely to encounter situations where a rabies-free environment cannot be assured adequately. Thus, preexposure immunization to rabies should be available to personnel working in high-risk categories, such as veterinarians, people who are working with or involved in the care of high-risk or inadequately characterized animals, and field biologists who work in rabies-endemic areas.",

In the presumed natural HBV infection in cynomolgus monkeys, HBV infection was suggested by the demonstration of HBV surface antigen in hepatic cells but was not associated with zoonotic disease transmission. These animals developed mild clinical disease characterized by anorexia, elevated hepatic enzyme levels, and hyperbilirubinemia. Also, there are other natural hepadnavirus infections of animals (woodchuck, ground squirrel, and duck) that are used as animal models of HBV infection, but none are transmissible to humans (Adams, 1995).

Other domestic and wild animals are also susceptible to HEV infection (Balayan, 1997). Reports have indicated that domestic pigs and wild rats may serve as reservoirs for this infection (Clayson et al., 1995), with infection in a majority of pigs over 3 months of age in some U.S. Midwestern herds (Meng et al., 1997). These pigs have been reported to appear clinically normal but developed viremia, positive serology, and microscopic signs of hepatic disease. Phylogenetic analyses have shown that the swine HEV is closely related to the human HEV strains in the United States forming a distinct phylogenetic branch (Meng et al., 1997, 1998). Although there have not been any recorded cases of HEV transmission in the laboratory animal facility environment from swine, nonhuman primates, or other laboratory animals, personnel should be instructed to observe proper PPE practices to prevent possible HEV transmission.",

Direct inoculation of open wounds or mucous membranes with infectious secretions during other activities such as fighting may also play a role, but airborne transmission is regarded as unlikely (Lairmore et al., 1989). The blood, secretions, and tissues of SIV-infected monkeys should be presumed to be infectious for persons potentially exposed to these materials. Two human cases of seroconversion to SIV associated with known exposure incidents have been recognized (CDC, 1992b; Khabbaz et al., 1992), and a blind serological survey of other personnel working with SIV has identified perhaps an additional three seropositive individuals (CDC, 1992a). The possible inclusion of the aforementioned cases of known SIV exposure and the cross-reactivity of SIV and HIV-2 in the assay employed confounded the interpretation of this survey (CDC, 1992a). In the first case, the individual's skin was punctured accidentally with a needle contaminated by the blood of an infected macaque. In the second case, a laboratory worker who had dermatitis on the hands and forearms and was under treatment with corticosteroids handled SIV-infected blood specimens without wearing gloves. The pattern of seroreactivity suggested the possibility of infection in the second case, and SIV infection was documented subsequently by PCR techniques (Khabbaz et al., 1994).",

Although foamy viruses have not been demonstrated as the cause of any disease entity in humans or in the nonhuman primate, they have been linked to a number of human disorders. The transmission of simian foamy viruses to humans accidentally exposed or occupationally exposed to nonhuman primates has been reported (Neuman-Haeflin et al., 1993; Heneine et al., 1998). In the case of occupational exposure, 4 of 231 individuals surveyed serologically were positive, and proviral DNA detection and viral isolation were used to confirm the infection (Heneine et al., 1998). In 1 human case, the simian foamy virus originated from African green monkeys; and in the other 3 cases, baboons served as the source. Clinical disease in humans has not resulted in any of these cases, and it is suggested that the virus persists in humans in a state of latency following accidental infection (Schweizer et al., 1997).

Humans serve as the reservoir with nonhuman primates becoming infected through contact with human populations with endemic measles. The disease spreads rapidly through infected nonhuman primate colonies, often with devastating consequences, and a 100% seroconversion rate to measles is common in wild-caught nonhuman primate populations within several weeks of capture. A recent serological survey in nonhuman primates from miscellaneous sources has indicated that in three macaque species commonly used in biomedical research, between 45 and 73% of the animals were seropositive for measles virus, but that less than 10% of the squirrel monkeys and marmosets surveyed were seropositive (Kalter et al., 1997). This finding possibly reflects the fact that these New World monkey species are more vulnerable and less likely to survive the disease than macaques. With the current emphasis on and success of domestic nonhuman primate production, it has become more likely that institutions will develop large populations of susceptible nonhuman primates that could contract measles and then transmit the disease to susceptible humans, as previously reported (Roberts et al., 1988).",

Because murine typhus is difficult to differentiate either clinically or anatomically from other rickettsial diseases, specific serological tests or PCR-based assays are extremely important in making the correct diagnosis (Farhang-Azad et al., 1985). The acute febrile disease is usually characterized by general malaise, headache, rash, and chills, with signs ranging from mild to severe. An encephalitic syndrome can also occur (Mushatt and Hyslop, 1991). In one report, 25% of 180 patients with the disease had delirium, stupor, or coma. Fortunately, these findings resolve with lowering of the febrile response. Fatality rate for all ages is about 2% but increases with age. Proper antibiotic therapy is the most effective measure to prevent morbidity or mortality due to rickettsial infections. Tetracycline and chloramphenicol have proven to be effective in hastening recovery and preventing neurologic sequelae, such as deafness due to eighth cranial nerve involvement (Mushatt and Hyslop, 1991).",

Complement fixation titer of 1:16 or greater in a single serum sample from a patient with clinically compatible signs is also considered diagnostic (McDade and Fishbein, 1988).

The placenta of infected ewes can contain up to 109 organisms per gram of tissue, and milk may contain 105 organisms per gram (CDCP-NIH, 1999). The organism is highly infectious with possibly as few as 10 organisms inducing infection (CDCP-NIH, 1999). The primary method of transmission is through infectious aerosols. The organism produces a sporelike form that is resistant to desiccation and persists in the environment for long periods of time, contributing to the widespread dissemination of infectious aerosols and resulting in infections miles from the original organism source (Franz et al., 1997; Tissot-Dupont et al., 1999). The importance of these factors was illustrated in outbreaks of the disease associated with the use of pregnant sheep in research facilities in the United States (Bernard et al., 1982). In these outbreaks, personnel who did not have direct contact with infected sheep but who worked along the transport routes for these animals became serologically positive for Q fever (Bernard et al., 1982; Reimer, 1993). Also, five of nine laundry workers without direct sheep contact but who processed linens soiled during sheep surgery developed serological evidence of infection.",

Advances in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods have improved the sensitivity of C. burnetii detection over that of the antigen capture ELISA, as well as improved the speed, safety, and convenience of the assay. The PCR method may offer some hope that the potential for organism shedding could be assessed on an individual animal basis to minimize the potential risk of Q fever outbreaks in animal facilities (Lorenz et al., 1998; Yanase et al., 1998).",

Chlamydial agents are widely distributed among birds and mammals worldwide and occur naturally among many laboratory animal species, including birds, mice, guinea pigs, hamsters, rabbits, ruminants, swine, cats, ferrets, muskrats, and frogs (Storz, 1971; Newcomer et al., 1982). Of these host species, birds with Chlamydophila psittaci comb. nov.

The most common human chlamydial infection, Chlamydia trachomatis, is not naturally transmissible to animals but is used to produce experimental infections in nonhuman primates. Chlamydia muridarium occurring in the mouse and C. suis occurring in the pig are closely related to C. trachomatis but are not infectious for humans. Also, Chlamydophila pecorum comb. nov.

            "text": "Animals in general have a complex oral microflora consisting of numerous bacterial species; both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria are therefore routinely isolated from traumatic bite wounds inflicted by domestic and wild animals. Common organisms isolated from dog bites include Staphylococcus species, Streptococcus species, a variety of anaerobes, and Pasteurella multocida. In a comprehensive multicenter study, 60% of dog-bite wounds were punctures, 10% were lacerations, and 30% were a combination of both. This compared to 85% of cat-bite wounds being punctures, 3% lacerations, and 12% a combination of both. In this study, 39% of 57 patients with cat bites presented as purulent wounds, whereas abscesses were present in 19% of the cases reviewed (Talan et al., 1999). Of the 50 patients with dog bites, 58% had purulent wounds, 30% were nonpurulent, and 12% were noted to have abscesses. Dog and cat bites had a mean of 5 bacterial species per wound; 63% of the cat bites analyzed compared to 48% of dog bites had a mixed anaerobic and aerobic population (Talan et al., 1999). Only aerobes grew in 36% of the cases (42% of dog bites and 32% cat bites), whereas anaerobes were the only species grown in 1% of the cases. Capnocytophaga canimorsus, an invasive organism, was recovered from 4.7% of the wounds. It should be noted that if fever occurs in immuncompromised patients after a bite wound, this organism should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was isolated from two cat-bite wounds, whereas Pasteurella spp. were present in the wounds 75% of the time in cats and 50% in dogs. Geographic locale is also important in defining bacterial flora of bites and scratches. In a study conducted in the southwestern and central United States, 17 of 1041 (1.6%) of the cases of tularemia in humans diagnosed from 1981 to 1987 were associated with cat scratches or bites (Taylor et al., 1991).",

A regional lymphadenopathy develops 14 days after the initial lesion in most cases. Lymphadenitis regresses in about 6 weeks, with 30\u201350% of the nodes becoming suppurative. Of the approximately 65% of people who develop systemic illness, fever and malaise are the symptoms most often noted. Occasionally observed are generalized lymphadenopathy, thrombocytopenia, encephalitis, osteolytic lesions, and erythema nodosum. The disease is benign, and most patients recover spontaneously without sequelae within 2 months, although lymphadenopathy can persist up to a year. In immunocompromised individuals, CSD is manifested by an unusual vascular growth seen on the skin and given the name bacillary epithelioid angiomatosis (LeBoit et al., 1988; Kemper et al., 1990). Systemic disease involving spleen and liver also occurs in these patients.",

Cricetid rodents, such as the wood rat, are occasionally cited as reservoir hosts. The oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, the common vector of plague, is well established throughout the United States, particularly in the southern United States and southern California. It is important to remember that more than 1500 species of fleas and 230 species of rodents are infected with Yersinia pestis. Only 30 to 40 rodent species, however, are permanent reservoirs of the infection (Macy, 1999). Plague is infrequently reported in the United States, with a low of 1 case in 1972 and a high of 40 cases in 1983 (Craven and Barnes, 1991). Ninety percent of the cases have been diagnosed in New Mexico, Colorado, and California. Urban development (particularly in New Mexico) encroached into plague-enzootic rodent habitats, placing human populations at increased risk of contracting the disease. In addition to rodent epizootics, dogs, and increasingly cats, either have served as passive transporters of the disease or have been actively infected (Rosner, 1987). The disease has seasonal peaks, with the highest proportion occurring May through September.",

In the 1950s, in a study conducted in Baltimore, 45.5% of 1643 rats were infected with Leptospira; higher prevalence rates occurred in older rats (approximately 60%). In the late 1970s, more than 90% of adult Brown Norway rats sampled in Detroit were infected with L. icterohaemorrhagiae (Thiermann, 1977). Other studies confirm the high prevalence of this organism in wild rats inhabiting U.S. cities (Alexander, 1984; Sanger and Thiermann, 1988). Rodent reservoir hosts of leptospirosis, in addition to rats, include mice, field moles, hedgehogs, gerbils, squirrels, rabbits, and hamsters (Torten, 1979; Fox and Lipman, 1991). Livestock serve as a significant source of primary long-term shedding of at least three serovars. Cattle are the natural carriers of the serotype L. hardjo, whereas swine carry L. pomona and L. bratislava; each animal can shed the organism for extended periods in their urine. Dogs also commonly harbor two other serotypes; feral dogs harbor L. icterohaemorrhagiae as well as serve as natural carrier hosts of L. canicola. Sheep, goats, and horses can also be infected with a variety of serotypes. Raccoons are reservoirs of L. antumnalis, whereas rats, mice, and other wild rodents are common animal hosts for another serotype, L. ballum. In wild mice, the infection can persist unnoticed for the animal's lifetime and can also be harbored by laboratory mice, although their carrier rates in the United States are unknown (Torten, 1979). There was, however, a report of leptospirosis in a research colony of mice in the United States in the early 1980s (Alexander, 1984). In several European laboratories, personnel have contracted leptospires from laboratory rats (Geller, 1979).",

Skin abrasions or mucous membrane exposure may serve as the portal of entry in humans. All secretions and excretions from infected animals should be considered infective. In one instance, a father apparently was infected after his daughter used his toothbrush to clean a contaminated pet mouse cage. Handling infected wild rats increases the risk of contracting leptospires (Luzzi et al., 1987). Also, a young man died of acute leptospirosis by falling into a heavily polluted river contaminated with L. icterohaemorrhagiae (Sanger and Thiermann, 1988). In addition, rodent bites can transmit the disease. Children living in rat-infested tenements may be at increased risk of infection. For example, children from inner-city Detroit had significantly higher L. icterohaemorrhagiae antibody titers when compared to those of children living in the Detroit suburbs (Demers et al., 1983).

The definitive diagnosis in humans or animals is made by culturing the organisms from tissue or fluid samples, or by animal inoculation (particularly in 3- to 4-week-old hamsters) and subsequent culture and isolation. Culture media with long-chain fatty acids with 1% bovine serum albumin are routinely used as a detoxicant (Faine, 1991). Serological assessment is accomplished by indirect hemagglutination, agglutination analysis, complement fixation, microscopic agglutination, and fluorescent antibody techniques (Faine, 1991). The serological test most frequently used is the microscopic agglutination test, which employs dark-field microscopy. Titers of 1:100 or greater are considered significant.

Because H. cinaedi has been isolated from normal intestinal flora of hamsters, it was suggested that the pet hamsters served as a reservoir for transmission to the mother. The mother had a diarrheal illness during the third trimester of pregnancy; the newborn was likely to have been infected during the birthing process, although this was not proven (Orlicek et al., 1993). Furthermore, the hamster has been suggested as possibly infecting other humans with Helicobacter cinaedi (Gebhart et al., 1989). Studies are needed to confirm zoonotic risk of handling H. cinaedi-infected hamsters (Gebhart et al., 1989). Also of interest is the isolation, based on cellular fatty acid and biochemical identification analysis, of H. cinaedi from the feces of dogs and a cat and from a rhesus monkey with chronic colitis (J.G.

Use of dark-field microscopy or acridine orange staining of blood culture media, rather than gram staining, increases likelihood of seeing the organism. Likewise, fecal isolation is difficult; selective antibiotic media are required, and recovery is facilitated by passing fecal homogenates through a 0.45 \u03bcm filter (Gebhart et al., 1989). In one study, several strains of both H. cinaedi and H. fennelliae were inhibited by concentrations of cephalothin and cetazolin used frequently in selective media for isolation of enteric micro-aerophilic bacterium. These organisms also require an environment rich in hydrogen for optimum in vitro growth. Until diagnostic laboratories embark on routine isolation attempts of Helicobacter spp. from feces, the extent of their presence in companion and pocket pets and their zoonotic potential will be unknown.",

            "text": "Although the reported prevalence of Salmonella spp. in laboratory animals has decreased in the last several decades because of management practices (e.g., pasteurizing animal feeds), environmental contamination with Salmonella spp. continues to be a potential source of infection for these animals and for the personnel handling them. Until all animal feeds in the United States and Europe are Salmonella-free and animals are procured from Salmonella-free sources, laboratory animal-associated cases of salmonellosis in humans will continue. Endemic salmonellosis in commercially raised guinea pigs as well as dogs, cats, and nonhuman primates has also been a source of infection in personnel working with these animals. Prevalence data from eight studies conducted worldwide indicated that a wide range (0.6\u201327%) of cats were culture-positive for Salmonella, and a conservative estimate for the U.S. canine population would be 10%. Rats are extremely susceptible to infection with Salmonella spp. In studies performed in the 1920s through 1940s, prevalence of Salmonella in wild rats surveyed in the United States varied from 1 to 18%, compared to 19% in Europe (Geller, 1979; Weisbroth, 1979; Alexander, 1984). In experimental studies, when rats were dosed orally with Salmonella, 10% shed the organism in the 2 months after inoculation, and a few remained carriers when examined 5 months after experimental challenge. These rats, when placed with other naive rats, were capable of initiating new epizootics. Fortunately, the disease in laboratory rats, although common prior to 1939, has been isolated rarely in U.S. commercially reared rats since that time. Birds and reptiles are particularly dangerous sources of Salmonella; as much as 94% of all reptiles harbor Salmonella spp. (Chiodini and Sundberg, 1981). Turtles have received a great deal of zoonotic attention and in 1970 alone may have caused 280,000 human cases of salmonellosis. In the late 1960s, with annual sales of 15 million turtles, zoonotic salmonellosis became a growing problem. In 1972, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned importation of turtles and turtle eggs and the interstate shipment of turtles that were not certified as free of Salmonella or Arizona hinshawii in their state of origin. However, the unreliable effectiveness of this method forced the FDA in 1975 to rule against the sale of viable turtle eggs or live turtles with a carapace length less than 10.2 cm, with exceptions made for educational or scientific institutions and marine turtles. Subsequently, there was a substantial decrease in turtle-associated salmonellosis, indicating the efficacy of this regulation. These restrictions are difficult to enforce, and other reptiles, e.g., iguanas, are increasingly cited in zoonotic outbreaks of salmonellosis, particularly in children. Also of note, because of repeated reports of chick- and duckling-associated salmonellosis, some states have also restricted their sale as pets.",

Fat and moisture in food promote survival of Salmonella. Pasteurization of milk and proper cooking of food (56\u00b0C for 10 to 20 min) effectively destroy Salmonella. In the laboratory, control and prevention of salmonellosis depends on the rapid detection, removal, or treatment of both acute and chronic animal infections, particularly during the quarantine period. Multiple antibiotic resistance is commonly encountered in Salmonella strains. For example, multiple-resistant S. typhimurium strain DTI04 has been increasingly cited (in Europe and recently in the United States) as a cause of human infections (Tauxe, 1999). Importantly, this organism has been isolated from farm animals, cats, wild birds, rodents, foxes, and badgers.

Large epidemics have occurred in humans ingesting the organism in contaminated municipal drinking water. Sporulated oocysts can exist in the intestine before being excreted. Disease transmission is through ingestion of infectious oocysts. The organisms are small (4\u20135 \u03bcm in diameter) and are located on the apical surface of the parasitized epithelial cell, where they protrude from the brush border.

Zoonotic disease has been reported among animal handlers and veterinary students working with neonatal ruminants, principally calves, infected before 6 weeks of age (Levine et al., 1988). Another transmission was recorded in an individual who became infected performing a survey of Cryptosporidium spp. in calves (Reese et al., 1982). In this patient, clinical remission occurred by day 13, and oocytes of cryptosporidium were no longer apparent on fecal flotation (Fig. 5\n). Disease in neonatal ruminants may be subclinical or may present with protracted watery diarrhea, very similar to what occurs in humans. Symptoms in humans occur 1 to 2 weeks after contact with infected calves, and diarrhea may be accompanied by vomiting, severe abdominal cramps, lassitude, fever, and headache. Disease is generally self-limiting except in immunocompromised individuals (Fayer and Ungar, 1986). Most of the recorded cases of protracted human cryptosporidiosis have occurred in immunodeficient individuals, particularly AIDs patients, and are regarded as opportunistic infections (Chin, 2000). Disease in these individuals produced low-grade fever, malaise, anorexia, nausea, abdominal cramps, and a protracted, watery diarrhea. Repeated intestinal biopsies in a patient have documented indigenous cryptosporidial stages for as long as 1 year; clinical signs also persisted in this patient.",

In addition, as the definitive hosts in the T. gondii life cycle, felines develop intestinal infection, with the shedding of oocysts. Thus, the domestic cat is the primary reservoir for the zoonotic transmission of T. gondii in the laboratory environment. The three common modes of transmission are congenital infection, ingestion of T. gondii\u2013infected tissue, and ingestion of toxoplasma oocytes or from direct exposure and consumption of contaminated food or water (Dubey, 1998). Most postnatally acquired infections in cats are asymptomatic and have a variable prepatent period and pattern of oocyst shedding. The prepatent period can be as brief as 3 days if the cat has ingested mice or meat containing T. gondii cysts, or it can be as long as several weeks if oocysts have been ingested. Shedding of oocysts in the feces occurs for 1\u20132 weeks, during which time cats are considered a public health risk (Dubey, 1998). Oocysts become infectious after sporulation, which occurs in 1\u20135 days. Oocysts survive best in warm, moist soil. Oocyst shedding is less likely to occur if the cat was infected by oocysts or tachyzoites than if infection resulted from the ingestion of Toxoplasma cysts. Oocyst shedding can be reactivated by induction of hypercorticism or by superinfection with other feline microorganisms, such as Isospora felis (Chessman, 1972). Oocysts of T. gondii have been observed infrequently in the feces of naturally infected cats (Ladiges et al., 1982), and shedding usually precedes the development of antibody titers to T. gondii. The oocyst is very hardy and can survive freezing and as much as several months of extreme heat and dehydration. Importantly, high IgG titers do not prove recent or active infection (Dubey et al., 1995).",

Congenital infection in humans results in systemic disease, frequently with severe neuropathological changes. Postnatal infection results in disease that is less severe and commonly presents as nondescript, consisting of fever, myalgia, and generalized lymphadenopathy that may resolve without treatment in a few weeks. Asymptomatic infection may recrudesce with encephalitis if patients become immunocompromised. Although rare, serious systemic toxoplasmosis can be acquired by older individuals. This is manifested by fever, maculopapular eruption, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, pneumonia, myocarditis, and meningoencephalitis. Ocular toxoplasmosis, usually chorioretinitis, is commonly seen in postnatal infections but can also occur in infections of older individuals. Clinically severe and progressive illness is most likely to develop in immunocompromised individuals. As high as 10% of AIDS patients have toxoplasmosis (Gill and Stone, 1992).

The preferred therapy is pyrimethamine administered in combination with sulfonamide. Laboratory-acquired infections are likely restricted to the use and handling of laboratory cats (DiGiacomo et al., 1990). Rigorous sanitation should effectively prevent human toxoplasmosis from occurring in the laboratory environment. Since oocysts must sporulate before they are infectious, daily cleaning of litter plans will prevent accumulation of infectious oocysts. Personnel should wear gloves when handling litter pans and wash their hands thoroughly before eating. Pregnant women should completely avoid contact with cat feces. Interestingly, there is no correlation between toxoplasmosis in adults and cat ownership. Most cats acquire infection shortly after weaning and shed the oocysts for a short period of time (< 3 weeks). Nevertheless, unsporulated oocysts are more susceptible to proper disinfection, and control of exposure should be centered around disinfection of litter pans at this stage.",

These ingested eggs hatch in the abnormal host and migrate into deep tissues, but development proceeds no further. Larvae may persist in the visceral organs or the eyes and cause granulomatous lesions, resulting in hepatosplenomegaly, fever, and eosinophilia (visceral larval migrans) (Edelglass et al., 1982; Davies et al., 1993) or leucocoria, eye pain, strabismus, or loss of vision (ocular larval migrans) (Bathrick, 1981). The most frequent cause of these diseases is Toxocara canis (dog) (Wolfrom et al., 1995) and Toxocara cati (cat) (Glickman and Magnava, 1993), but Baylisascaris procyonis in the raccoon is much more aggressive and therefore more pathogenic (Fox et al., 1988). Fatal or severe central nervous system disorders have been documented for mice, woodchucks, pigeons, domestic quail, turkeys, captive prairie dogs, and armadillos, and two human fatalities have been reported. Several other animal parasites have been associated with larval migrans-like syndromes. These include Ascaris suum (swine), Capillaria hepatica (rat), Angiostrongylus cantonensis (rat), Gnathostoma spinigerum (dogs and cats) (Bathrick, 1981), and Angiostrongylus costaricensis (cotton rats) (Levine, 1980). Human involvement has been reported with each of the above.",

Ticks, like mites, can transmit a variety of diseases, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tick-borne typhus, Lyme disease, and others (Table IV\n). Lyme borreliosis is a commonly reported tick-borne infection in Europe and North America. The illness is caused by a spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted during the blood feeding of ticks of the genus Ixodes. The larvae and nymphs feed readily on a wide range of hosts, including birds, and an abundance of reservoir hosts exists, usually small and medium-sized animals. Larger animals, such as deer, sheep, cows, or horses, must be present for the maintenance of the tick population since adult ticks only engorge successfully on larger animals. Transmission occurs through salivation during the feeding process on a host.",

Three rodent fleas, Xenopsylla cheopis, Nasopsyllus fasciatus, and Leptopsylla segnis, have been found in a high percentage of urban dwellings in certain areas of the United States and are potential transmitters of disease in the laboratory. Apparently, X. cheopis in the past was readily established in animal facilities. At a Midwestern U.S. university, it inhabited rooms housing laboratory mice, where on two separate occasions fleas bit students (Yunker, 1964). Leptopsylla segnis, the mouse and rat flea, bites humans and is a vector for plague and typhus, serious diseases in humans. Leptopsylla segnis can also serve as an intermediate host for the rodent tapeworms Hymenolepis nana and H. diminuta, both of which can infect humans (Markell et al., 1999). The flea bite can be irritating and can cause allergic dermatitis. The cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis, is the most common flea in and around human dwellings in the United States. This flea is capable of experimentally transmitting plague and murine typhus, and therefore the potential exists for transmitting the disease to humans. Control of fleas consists of treatment of infested areas as well as the primary host; in the case of rodent fleas, the animal facility must be free of feral rodents and their entry to prevent introduction of these arthropods.",
