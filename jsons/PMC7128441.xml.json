            "text": "Acute viral respiratory tract infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children, particularly those with compromised immune systems [1, 2, 3]. Nucleic acid amplification tests have shown their superiority over classical diagnostic methods, such as direct fluorescent antibody detection (DFA) and viral isolation, in identifying a broader range of viruses, with higher sensitivity and specificity [4, 5, 6]. Recently, several studies have demonstrated the advantages of multiplex PCR for simultaneous detection of a panel of viruses in one assay [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. In this study we compared (i) the sensitivity and specificity of four commercial multiplex PCR assays with DFA and viral isolation for detection of respiratory viruses in children, and (ii) the sensitivity of two assays, Resplex II Plus PRE and Seeplex Influenza A/B Subtyping, with the Astra influenza Screen & Type assay and DFA for detection of H1 and H3 seasonal and pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza A virus.",

The Astra influenza Screen & Type triplex assay was designed to detect seasonal INFA and pandemic H1N1 2009 INFA in a real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR format and used the Rotor\u2010Gene 3000 instrument (Corbett Research, Mortlake, NSW, Australia). This assay was chosen as the reference standard due to its performance in a proficiency panel for the detection of H1N1 2009 INFA, in which 22 laboratories participated, using 18 different assays. The Astra kit was found to have the highest sensitivity of detection compared with all other assays, including the CDC H1N1 2009 assay (26th Annual Clinical Virology Symposium, abstract S35).

Seeplex RV15 and RVP Fast detected 100% of bocavirus infections, while the sensitivity of Resplex II v2.0 was only 75%. Detection of enterovirus and rhinovirus was the most inconsistent. Although the specific targets for each multiplex assay are proprietary, it is known that the highly conserved regions of the 5\u2032NTR region of either rhinoviruses or enteroviruses, will also amplify members of the other genus. Thus, some assays, such as the RVP and RVP Fast assays, have combined the enterovirus and rhinovirus targets, because developing specific targets for each genus outside of the 5\u2032NTR region may compromise sensitivity of detection, especially of the rhinoviruses. This is possibly the case with the Seeplex RV15 assay, which separates enteroviruses and rhinoviruses, but has a lower sensitivity than the other assays. Though the Resplex II v2.0 assay differentiates between enteroviruses and rhinoviruses, the occurrence of 38.4% of positive specimens testing positive for both targets, suggests that there may be cross\u2010reactivity between them.",

In the case of influenza A, knowledge of the subtype is important with respect to predicting the activity of antiviral agents such as the adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors. In addition to increased sensitivity and number of viruses detected, multiplex assays permit the improved identification of cases of infection with multiple agents, which may be clinically significant, especially in immune compromised individuals. In our study, we found that two or more viruses were present in 10.9% of specimens (16.3% of positive specimens). Bocavirus and coronaviruses were the viruses most commonly associated with multiple agent infection, followed by human metapneumovirus, the parainfluenza viruses, adenovirus and the entero/rhinoviruses. Influenza A/B and RSV were the least likely to be detected in the presence of another virus. The role of multiple viral agents in affecting the clinical course of disease is at present unknown and worthy of further study.",

It was the only assay that required three PCR master mixes with five targets in each one plus the internal control. It was also the only assay that incorporated positive controls for all 15 viral targets, which is considered an additional quality control feature of the assay. Seeplex RV15 was the assay with the shortest post\u2010PCR step, especially for a small number of specimens when using the Lab 901 Screen Tape\u00ae system (maximum five specimens per run). In contrast, the Resplex II v2.0, RVP and RVP Fast use a 96\u2010well microtitre plate format on the Luminex platform, permitting high throughput analysis.",

Mahony et al. [15] have shown that RVP employed as the first\u2010line diagnostic tool in children was the least costly strategy, compared with DFA and culture, DFA alone or DFA plus RVP, when the prevalence of infection was \u226511%. The cost of molecular testing is offset by its more efficient use of labour than conventional DFA and culture and by savings to the healthcare system when additional testing and hospitalization can be avoided by knowledge of a test result with high sensitivity and specificity. Operationally, molecular methods also allow virology laboratories to continue to function, even in the event that viral culture cannot be carried out due to biosafety issues.",

This is important, as traditional seasonal H1 subtyping molecular assays will not react with the pandemic strain and it is expected that the 2009 pandemic strain may become the predominant circulating seasonal H1 strain in the immediate post\u2010pandemic period.",

However, it will be important to develop more effective clinical and laboratory algorithms for their timely and optimal use and to study their impact on patient care in different populations in different clinical settings. Influenza, RSV, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus and hMPV have been well established as leading causes of respiratory infection among infants and children [16, 17, 18]. However, the role of rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, bocavirus and coronaviruses as co\u2010pathogens in upper respiratory tract infection or as agents of lower respiratory tract infection, has been less well investigated, and will be aided by studies using this technology [19].",
