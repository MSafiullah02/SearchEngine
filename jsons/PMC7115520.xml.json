To evade these defence machanisms, the influenza viruses are known to circumvent the potent antiviral interferon action by inhibiting the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), and the general interferon signaling pathway [1]. The viruses achieve this in part through their double stranded RNA (ds RNA) binding protein called non-structural protein-1 (NS-1) [1]. By doing so, influenza viruses can replicate unabated in the host's respiratory tract.",

Poly ICLC is a synthetic ds RNA condensed with poly-l-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose, and is a known TLR-3 agonists [4]. The X-ray crystal structure of the poly IC:TLR-3 receptor signaling complex has been determined [4]. Since TLR-3 activation by ds RNA results in induction of type I interferons, it follows that Poly ICLC, when delivered in liposomes to the endosomal membrane location, may strengthen the host antiviral defence against influenza virus by priming the interferon levels and, therefore, reversing the interferon knockdown by the viruses. In addition, oligonucleotides containing unmethylated CpG motifs, a TLR-9 agonist [5], are evaluated as stand alone immunomodulating antiviral agents.",

At 4, 24, 48 and 72 h post-drug treatment, mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and the lungs were aseptically removed and homogenized in Trizol. Total RNA was extracted from lung tissues by Trizol method (Invitrogen). One \u03bcg of RNA was used for DNase I (Fermentas) digestion before doing RT (reverse transcription) to make 1st strand cDNA. RT was performed using high capacity cDNA RT kit with random primers (ABI). Thermal profile for the RT step was as follows: 25 \u00b0C for 10 min (hold); 37 \u00b0C for 120 min (hold); 85 \u00b0C for 3 s (hold). Real-time PCR was performed using TaqMan probe-based detection (ABI) that was run on an ABI Fast 7500 System. TaqMan Gene Expression assay (ABI) consists of two unlabelled PCR primers and a FAM dye labelled TaqMan MGB (minor groove binder) probe. The PCR step was as follows: 95 \u00b0C for 20 s for enzyme activation, 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 3 s, annealing and extension at 60 \u00b0C for 30 s. \u03b2-Actin was used as an internal control to normalize the expression of target genes. Comparative Ct method for relative quantitation was used to calculate fold changes. Serial dilutions of different inputs of target and reference genes were performed to verify that efficiencies of target and reference are approximately equal (data not shown). Data analysis was performed using 7500 software v2.0 (ABI).",

The activation of the TLR signaling pathway results in the stimulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses and may be partially responsible for the antiviral state against influenza infections. Influenza viruses are highly effective and adaptable infectious agents which can overcome antiviral therapy by developing drug resistance, and by overcoming the host's immune defence mechanisms. Conventional anti-influenza drugs target the virus structure, and they are susceptible to the emergence of drug resistance. Animal studies suggest that activation of TLR signaling pathway by TLR agonists provides protection not only against influenza virus infections, but also respiratory syncytial virus [7], SARS-CoV [8], and hepatitis B [9], among others. The activation of the toll-like receptor signaling pathway may represent an effective broad-spectrum strategy against these viruses. This approach targets the cells of the innate immune system and hence, is less likely to result in drug resistance. In addition, it provides an effective means to enhance and/or restore interferon production during viral replication. In summary, TLR agonists may represent an affective and broad-spectrum antiviral strategy to combat influenza viruses which are unpredictable and ever changing.",
