Literature search through PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase was completed by 2 reviewers from November 1, 2019 to April 20, 2020. Inclusion criteria were observational case-control or cohort studies on COVID-19 patients with a history of CVD included, which reported outcomes of COVID-19 infection severity, clearly outlined the definition of \"severe disease\" and with sample size >10. Data were abstracted independently by 2 authors. Studies were divided into two separate cohorts for analysis: severity (severe vs. non-severe) and mortality (non-survivors vs. survivors). Data was pooled into a meta-analysis to estimate pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each outcome. A total of 18 studies (n= 4,858 patients) were included. Sixteen studies were from China, while 2 were from the United States. Preexisting CVD was associated with a significantly increased risk of a severe form of COVID-19 (OR= 3.14; 95% CI 2.32-4.24; I 2 =0%; Q= 8.68, p=0.73) and overall risk of COVID-19 all-cause mortality (OR= 11.08; 95% CI: 2.59-47.32; I 2 =55%; p=0.11). However, this study did not find a significant association between previous history of CVD and mortality in severe COVID-19 disease (OR=1.72; 95% CI: 0.97-3.06, I 2 =0%, p=0.46). Pre-existing CVD is associated with worse outcomes among patients with COVID-19. Clinicians and policymakers need to take account of these findings in implementing risk stratification models.",

Clinical and biological predictors are needed for identifying severity of COVID-19 infection and helping in judicious allocation of limited resources. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, and has also been associated with worse outcomes in patients with influenza and bacterial pneumonias. [1] [2] [3] Emerging data have linked the presence of CVD with a worse prognosis in COVID-19 patients. [4] [5] [6] Likewise, COVID-19 is associated with a high inflammatory, inducing vascular inflammation, myocarditis, and cardiac arrhythmias, 5 which in turn can aggravate the damage to the heart. 4 However, a few and scattered studies, with widely varying results, have been published so far. The small sample size of patients with a previous CVD history in these studies further limits its applicability. Thus, we aimed to compile and analyse all results recently published on the influence of CVD in the severity of COVID-19 infection. To this end, we carried out a pooled analysis of current studies and evaluate the association between underlying or previous history of CVD conditions and outcomes of infection severity in COVID-19 patients.",

The electronic search was carried out using the strategy as follows: 1) \"COVID-19\" OR \"SARS-CoV-2\" OR \"coronavirus disease 2019\"; 2) \"cardiovascular disease\" OR \"coronary artery disease\" OR \"hypertension\"; 3) 2 AND 3. No language restriction was made. When the articles were published by the same study group and there was an overlap of the search period, only the most recent article was included to avoid duplication of data. The PubMed function \"related articles\" was used to extend the search. Also, we searched major infectious disease, cardiovascular and general medicine journals reporting articles about COVID-19 infection to look for additional studies. We then performed hand-search of the bibliography of included studies, to detect other potentially eligible investigations.",
