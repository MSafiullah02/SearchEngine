            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an economically important acute enteric disease in pigs of all ages. The disease is characterized by diarrhea and dehydration causing mortality - particularly in neonatal piglets \u2013 and growth retardation. The causative agent is porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which is an enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA virus, belonging to the family of Coronaviridae (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978). The genome of PEDV is approximately 28 kb long and about two-third encodes for non-structural proteins and one-third of structural proteins (Kocherhans et al., 2001). Among these proteins, the main research interest is focused on the Spike (S) gene and its glycoprotein product S, mediating receptor binding and membrane fusion (Li et al., 2016). Although only one serotype has been described, phylogenetic studies of the S gene showed that PEDV can be genetically separated into two groups: genogroup 1 (G1) and genogroup 2 (G2). Each genogroup can be further divided into subgroups 1a and 1b, and 2a and 2b, respectively (Lee, 2015).",

In the eighties and nineties, the virus was detected in many countries in Europe including the Netherlands and from Europe PEDV spread to Asia, where it caused large outbreaks with considerable losses in the pig industry (Song and Park, 2012). Until 2013, North America was considered to be free of PEDV infections (Cima, 2013), but in that same year highly virulent strains of PEDV emerged in the United States of America (US), causing diarrhea, vomiting and loss of appetite in pigs of all age groups and up to 100% of mortality in suckling piglets (Chen et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2013; Stevenson et al., 2013). This strain, typed as G2b, rapidly spread across the US, Canada, Mexico and several countries in South America (Vlasova et al., 2014).",

In 2014, outbreaks of PEDV were described in Germany and phylogenetic analysis showed a very high nucleotide similarity with a variant of PEDV (OH851) containing nucleotide insertions and deletions in the S gene (S-INDEL) that was isolated in the US in January 2014 (Hanke et al., 2015; Stadler et al., 2015). This variant, typed as G1b, caused mild clinical signs and lower mortality rates in suckling piglets compared to other circulating PEDV G2b strains in the US (Wang et al., 2014). Since the reports of outbreaks in Germany, more reports about outbreaks of this particular S-INDEL virus in several European countries have been published, among which France, Belgium, Spain, Portugal and Austria (EFSA, 2016; Grasland et al., 2015; Mesquita et al., 2015; Steinrigl et al., 2015). This suggests that this mild PEDV variant is circulating in Europe since the beginning of 2014.",

As a result, it was expected that, if PEDV was present in a sow herd, the within herd prevalence would be very high (Bertasio et al., 2016; Goede et al., 2015). The required number of blood samples per herd was calculated using WinEpiscope 2.0 (Thrusfield et al., 2001). To detect infection in a herd with 95% probability, an estimated within herd prevalence of 70%, and an average herd size of 464 sows per farm (WUR, 2016), three blood samples per farm were required. In 2014, there were approximately 2061 sow farms in the Netherlands (WUR, 2016). In order to show with a high probability (95%), that less than 1% of the Dutch farms (N = 20) were infected, 286 farms would need to be tested (Thrusfield et al., 2001). Herds were randomly selected stratified by pig density per province to represent the total Dutch sow herd population (Fig. 1\nA and B). Statistical analyses were performed using STATA/SE version 14.1 software (Stata Corporation, 2017).",

Therefore, it was decided to monitoring and follow up of specific management advices to the farmers. Five fattening herds, five sow herds and one nursery herd were selected after PEDV infection was confirmed by PCR on feces. For control and eradication of PEDV, a tailor made advice per farm, mainly based on biosecurity measures, was given. Advise was mainly focused on the separation between PEDV-infected and non-infected healthy animals. This separation was applied in stables, animal categories and compartments. It was made using the following measures: dress code (change between compartments), additional disinfection cleaning and disinfection of compartments and corridors and improving pest control. Furthermore, all professional herd visitors were informed and required to take measures, in particular those aimed at cleaning and disinfection, which would prevent the transfer of the disease to another pig farm. Regular testing of pooled fecal samples was done to monitor the effect of interventions. In sow herds, nursery piglets and replacement gilts were sampled; in fattening herds a random sampling in all age groups was performed. After introduction of PEDV, the virus could be detected in a compartment for 4\u20136 weeks. At farm level the virus was detectable much longer due to transmission to new susceptible animals. Farms were presumed negative for PEDV if three sampling rounds with at least 2-weeks interval, of thirty randomly taken individual fecal samples each, proved to be PCR negative.",

The used ELISA based on the S1 protein of a G2b strain showed a high sensitivity and specificity against antibodies raised against G1a, G1b en G2b strains. However, the ELISA was validated with a limited amount of samples (Supplementary Fig. 1) and field samples may react differently, just like in a similar ELISA recently described (Gerber et al., 2014). The viral spike (S) protein is prominent on the virus surface and is very immunogenic. All animals that have been infected with PEDV have antibodies against the S protein and particularly against the S1-part. The S1-part of the spike protein is the most variable part between related coronaviruses and there is no cross reactivity with other coronaviruses such as Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), Porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV) and Porcine Delta Coronavirus (PDCoV) as previously described (Gimenez-Lirola et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2015b). Because results of immunoassays based on the S protein correlate well with viral neutralization (Paudel et al., 2014), as shown in Supplementary Table 1, we decided to use the VNT as an alternative sero-diagnostic assay.",

The number of ELISA positive animals (67%, Table 2, group 3) on the index farm after the clinical signs started, seemed to justify the assumption of the high within herd prevalence of 70% for sample size calculation for the serological survey. Eventually, there were fewer herds sampled than planned (267 instead of 286) since it was decided to stop the serological survey, because the first case of PEDV was diagnosed in the Netherlands on November 14th 2014.",

Therefore, the authorities in the Netherlands advised all parties in the pig production industry to optimize their hygiene measures to ensure that infection by this virus would be avoided as much as possible. The strict preventive biosecurity measures taken in these herds demonstrated that most herds that were monitored could prevent the transfer to PEDV naive compartments within the herd and some were able to obtain a presumed PEDV free status for the whole farm. Additionally, a higher biosecurity level helps preventing the introduction of other pathogens and controls the spread of infection within that herd (FAO, 2010). However, an increasing number of herds became infected (Fig. 2) and PEDV spread across the country after the initial outbreak (Fig. 1C). The transport trucks with positive animals between herds seemed to have the highest transmission risk (data not shown). The number of new PEDV PCR positive farms per month since the beginning of the outbreak is most likely an underestimation (Fig. 2). Since PED is not a notifiable disease, nor have all veterinarians performed diagnostic testing in all cases, as the clinical signs of an outbreak are very typical.",
