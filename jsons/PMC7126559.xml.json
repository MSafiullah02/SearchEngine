            "text": "The intestine of the low birth weight premature infant is immature in many of its functional aspects [13]. There is decreased digestion and absorption of many essential nutrients. There is limited ability to both secrete enzymes as well as decreased intestinal motility. Undigested carbohydrate is substrate for intestinal flora which produce organic acids and gases. The liver which metabolizes a number of compounds absorbed from the intestine does so with variable degrees of success. The preterm infant's immature intestinal barrier is less efficient at controlling toxins and organisms, specifically bacteria and viruses that are able to induce mucosal disruption. These organisms may initiate a local inflammatory response releasing mediators that are toxins. These should be removed by the liver, to prevent a severe systemic response. Table 2\ndelineates the characteristics of Primary and Secondary NEC [12], [14], [15]. The unfed infant commonly has multiple organ involvement before the bowel damage which is limited to a single site, commonly within the small bowel [11]. If the infant has been fed, the onset is much later (beyond 7 days) with over 25% of cases occurring after a month of age. The affected site is the distal ileum and proximal colon where undigested substrate (carbohydrate) first meets a significant load of bacteria. The intestine is the first organ affected and then there is subsequent systemic illness. A key difference between the two (Table 2) is that the acidosis of Secondary NEC is lactic acidosis whereas the acidosis of the late onset form (Primary NEC) is a mixed metabolic acidosis comprising more than one short chain fatty acid or organic acid [6], [12].",

Most studies are unfunded and are commonly retrospective as a secondary or tertiary analysis. Many important variables are missing, including events preceding the onset of NEC in the individual baby. Because there has been no well-defined etiology, investigator bias adds to the confusion. In general, the prevailing basic theory is that the preterm infant is born with multiple limitations of an immature intestine including malabsorption, immune dysregulation, a poorly regulated intestinal circulatory system, poor intestinal motility, and mucosal barrier defects [3], [4], [11], [14].",

Timing is important because subclinical cases may recover within several days once cautious feeding and supportive care have been initiated. A concept which is no longer relevant is the diving seal reflex. It is a mature reflex not found in seal pups.

About 90% of patients afflicted with NEC are preterm, less than 34 weeks gestation, and have been enterally fed, many for several weeks [3], [12], [14]. Most of the babies have gained weight demonstrating maturing intestinal function which then becomes impaired. The majority of the babies have not had an apparent hypoxic-ischemic insult and one quarter of the cases of NEC occur beyond a month of age, suggesting perinatal events have little to no significance in Primary NEC. Therefore, the etiology of NEC falls into two broad categories; Secondary NEC encompassing infection, approximately 5%, and ischemia reperfusion injury 5\u201310%.

There is no correlation with NEC of premature babies and acute tubular necrosis, perinatal asphyxia, and intraventricular hemorrhage. Animal models of ischemia have been the Primary NEC model since the 1960s. In a sheep model, event reducing the hematocrit to 30% and giving a hypoxic insult of 10% oxygen for 30 min, oxygen consumption was not compromised as there was increased tissue O2 extraction and therefore no intestinal damage [16]. In a canine model of NEC, two hours of hypoxia and resuscitation, if the dogs were sacrificed within 24 h there was intestinal vascular congestion and hemorrhage [17]. If the animals were allowed three days before sacrifice there was full recovery of the intestine with normal histology. The intestine has the ability recover if there is not a continued insult.",

The fermentation process of bacteria produces several gases, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Carbon dioxide is soluble and rapidly dissolved. Hydrogen is the gas in the bowel wall of pneumatosis intestinalis as well as the portal gas A series of organic acids (short chain fatty acids) are produced in the fermentation process including lactic acid, butyric acid, propionic acid, acetic acid, isobutyric acid, and formic acid [18].

This sets the stage for high concentrations of multiple organic acids within the intestine that cause mucosal inflammation, leading to systemic acidosis. The concept of intraluminal organic acids inducing colitis is well described in that organic acids, acetic, butyric acid and propionic acid have been used in animal models to induce inflammatory colonic disease [6], [24], [25], [26], [27].",

Several studies have shown there is a change in the intestinal flora in children who develop necrotizing enterocolitis in that the proteobacteria constitute as much as 70% of the organisms in the stool, in cases within three days preceding the clinical diagnosis of NEC [28]. Included in this group are the previously mentioned Gram negative rods E. coli, Klebsialla sp. and others. Despite the systematic search, no consistent pathogen has been identified by culture techniques or by genomic analysis. The organism colonizes the GI tract while the baby is being fed sterile liquid formula or breast milk. The hypothetical organism would have to be one that preferentially affects the distal ileum and proximal colon, the primary sites of disease in preterm babies. No other intestinal or colonic pathogen has shown any similar pattern. There is no seasonal pattern as is commonly found with intestinal infections. Toxins have rarely been identified in preterm NEC. Although an important etiology for GI disease in older children they are not an issue in newborns in that toxin receptors are not yet developed.",

            "text": "To initiate intestinal damage a mechanism to disrupt the mucosal barrier is a central concept. Only three of the many mechanisms of disruption of the intestinal mucosal barrier in animal models [29], [30] seem to be of any significance. These are ischemia reperfusion injury, bacterial toxins, and organic acids. Since there is minimal likelihood of bacterial toxins or ischemic reperfusion injury, the organic acids should be the focus. Inflammation likely begins with carbohydrate (lactose) malabsorption and leads to bacterial fermentation and the generation of multiple organic acids, short chain fatty acids which disrupt the mucosal barrier. A local activation of the proinflammatory defense response along with poor motility and stasis initiates intestinal inflammation and potentially necrosis. A number of cells are responsible for the inflammation including cells which initiate and exacerbate the process. These are listed in Table 3\n. Of particular note here is the mast cell [30], [31], [32], [33], [34]. The mast cell has not been well studied since it is consumed in the inflammatory process and is no longer present in necrotic tissue. The mast cell has over 30 different mediators, some rapidly eluted, some from preformed granules, and others secondary or newly generated. Mediators reported associated with NEC (Table 4\n) include Leukotrienes C4, D4, Interleukin-6,8 oxygen radicals, platelet activating factor and thromboxane all of which can be found in an activated mast cell [33], [34], [35], [36].",

            "text": "Of the original list of systemic and gastrointestinal signs and symptoms of feeding-associated Primary NEC the one critical factor is mixed metabolic acidosis. With hypoxic ischemic injury the lactic acidosis is transient and readily managed. The mixed metabolic acidosis of NEC is sustained which often takes many hours to fully resolve. Using tandem mass spectroscopy, we have examined the whole blood organic acid profile of babies in the NICU with severe metabolic acidosis (Fig. 1\n). Babies (N\n = 28) with hypoxic ischemia injury, and conditions other than NEC have lactic acid as the primary circulating metabolite causing the acidosis. Babies with NEC (N\n = 8) and severe metabolic acidosis had propionic acid as the primary organic acid. Propionic acid is one of the important metabolic fermentation products of members of the proteobacteria specifically E. coli, and Klebsiella sp. [24], [25]. Endogenous sources of propionic acid result from catabolism of a small number group of amino acids. Protein catabolism is unlikely in preterm infants who are growing after having been fed successfully. The primary source of the propionic acid producing metabolic acidosis is the intestinal bacteria which continue to generate acid as long as substrate is available. This explains the location of NEC as distal and proximal colon where the most rapid fermentation occurs. Fermentation more distal is less likely since the substrate is consumed especially in the context of poor motility, inflamed distal ileum and proximal colon. Based on newborn screening program data from New York State (NY State DOH \u2013 personal communication) preterm infants <34 weeks gestation often have limited capacity to clear propionic acid. This organic acid is metabolized only by the liver. Other organic acids such as lactic and short chain fatty acidic with fewer than 4 carbons (C4) are metabolized by the Krebs Cycle present in the majority of tissues. In newborn screening programs propionic acid is a common false/positive in babies who are fed. The propionic acid is elevated prior to 34 weeks gestation and resolves without true disease. This suggests a maturational defect of the liver to metabolize propionic acid. The enzyme (propionyl CoA carboxylase) converts propionic acid to methylmalonyl-CoA and a Vitamin B12 dependent enzyme rearranges it to succinyl CoA the precursor of succinic acid, which is within the Krebs cycle. Prior to birth without intestinal colonization there is no generation of organic acids from the intestine and therefore no need to have the hepatic enzymes functional.",
