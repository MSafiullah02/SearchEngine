Interestingly, different cell types show different substrate selectivity for acetylation of sialic acid indicating that there are different classes of acetyltransfereases.2, 3, 8 Alternatively, it may be possible that adaptor proteins control the substrate specificity. Initially, acetyl transferases introduce an acetyl ester at C-7 or C-9 of sialic acid and under physiological conditions, the C-7 acetyl ester can migrate to C-8 or C-9 making C-9 acetylation (Neu5,9Ac2) the most prevalent sialic acid modification of cell surface glycoconjugates.2, 7 Acetylation of the C-4 hydroxyl of sialosides has also been observed.9\n",

It was found that acetylation did not affect the conformational properties of the oligosaccharide. However, it was shown that an antibody specific for a 9-O-acetylated ganglioside can make direct interactions with the acetyl group rationalizing the selective recognition of acetylated derivatives.16, 19\n",
