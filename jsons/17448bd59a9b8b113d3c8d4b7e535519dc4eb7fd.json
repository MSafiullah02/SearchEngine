Unlike well-studied inbred mice, T cell responses of diverse size and quality are generated following infection of humans and outbred mice. Thus, additional models are needed that accurately reflect variation in immune outcomes in genetically diverse populations and to uncover underlying genetic causes. The Collaborative Cross (CC), a large recombinant inbred panel of mice, is an ideal model in this pursuit for the high degree of genetic variation present, because it allows for assessment of genetic factors underlying unique phenotypes. Here, we advance the utility of the CC as a tool to analyze the immune response to viral infection. We describe variability in resting immune cell composition and adaptive immune responses generated among CC strains following systemic virus infection and reveal quantitative trait loci responsible for generation of CD62L+ memory CD8 T cells.",

            "text": "CD8 T cells play an important role in mediating protection against cancer and bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections, and hosts containing memory CD8 T cells are often better protected against tumors or pathogenic re-infection (Epstein et al., 2011; Brown and Kelso, 2009; Duan and Thomas, 2016; Masopust, 2009; Pamer, 2004; Schmidt and Varga, 2018; Sahin et al., 2017) . Therefore, research utilizing laboratory mice has focused on understanding factors influencing memory CD8 T cell generation and characteristics of memory CD8 T cell responses that confer protection against re-infection. This research has led to the understanding that, along with location, size of the memory pool and phenotypic/ functional qualities of memory CD8 T cells dictate the level of host protection against reinfection (Seder et al., 2013; Schmidt et al., 2008; Mackay et al., 2012; Nolz and Harty, 2011; Wherry et al., 2003; Bachmann et al., 2005; Olson et al., 2013; Sl\u00fctter et al., 2013 Sl\u00fctter et al., , 2017 Martin et al., 2015; Eberlein et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2014) . However, the translational value of mouse immunology studies depends on how faithfully those models reflect human immunology, and recent studies have noted areas in which mouse models fail to accurately reflect the human condition. Studies using so-called \"dirty mice\" have documented that the composition of immune cells present in mice housed in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) facilities is more similar to infants than adult humans and that CD8 T cell responses generated following infection are qualitatively different in SPF mice compared to dirty mice Reese et al., 2016; Masopust et al., 2017) . Similarly, mouse studies, conducted using 1 or 2 strains of inbred mice, fail to fully capture the array of immune responses and outcomes following infection that can be observed in genetically diverse humans (Graham et al., 2015 (Graham et al., , 2016 Ferris et al., 2013) .",

Additional studies in humans with experimental vaccination against yellow fever virus have also documented variation in the magnitude of CD8 T cell responses and changes in memory CD8 T cell phenotype and function over time after infection (Akondy et al., 2017) . Taken together, these studies suggest that underlying host genetic factors influence quantitative and qualitative aspects of memory CD8 T cell development following infection, parameters that directly influence the degree of host protection against re-infection. However, due to a lack of tools available in either humans or outbred mice, determining specific genetic factors underlying diverse immune outcomes would be extremely costly and time consuming.",

            "text": "The Collaborative Cross (CC) model circumvents these difficulties and presents an opportunity to examine the biological networks and genetic factors regulating divergent CD8 T cell outcomes following infection in a genetically diverse population. The CC was conceptualized by the complex trait consortium in 2002 as a resource for investigation of biomolecular networks and systems level phenotypes underlying complex traits (Churchill et al., 2004) . CC mice are a recombinant inbred panel of mice derived using a funnel breeding strategy with eight founder strains of mice-5 classical inbred strains (A/J, C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ, non-obese diabetic [NOD]/ShiLtJ, and NZO/HILtJ) and 3 wild-derived strains (CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ; Threadgill et al., 2011) . Founder strains contain representatives from the three major Mus musculus subspecies (M.m. musculus, M.m. domesticus, and M.m. castaneous) and capture almost 90% of the known genetic variation present in laboratory mice originating from M. musculus, and the variation is randomly distributed across the genome (Threadgill and Churchill, 2012) . Existing CC lines contain millions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions or deletions (indels) that result in vast genetic diversity between lines. However, progeny within lines are inbred, genetic clones allowing for precise analysis, reproducibility, and comparative studies across different laboratories (Phillippi et al., 2014; Collaborative Cross Consortium, 2012) . Efforts to characterize the genomes of CC strains facilitate the use of genetic analytical tools, such as quantitative trait linking (QTL), that allow for dissection of the genetic factors underlying complex phenotypic traits (Collaborative Cross Consortium, 2012; Srivastava et al., 2017; Graham et al., 2017) , such as quantity and quality of memory CD8 T cells generated following infection.",

Subset composition of effector and memory CD8 T cells was also highly variable among CC strains, and rates of memory CD8 T cell phenotypic progression following infection varied among strains to a similar extent to that seen in outbred mice. QTL analysis revealed significant linkages to chromosomal regions associated with the development of CD62L+ memory CD8 T cells following infection and allowed identification of genes potentially driving this phenotype.",

To corroborate previous studies and to document steady-state immune composition for the 47 CC strains utilized in this study, we bled all mice prior to infection and stained peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) using 5 flow cytometry panels to identify CD4 and CD8 T cells, Foxp3+ regulatory CD4 T cells, B220+/CD3\u2212 B cells, NKp46+/CD3\u2212 natural killer (NK) cells, and SSC hi /CD11b hi granulocytes or SSC lo /CD11b hi monocytes (example dot plots shown in Figure S1 ). All mice used in this study were female, and CC strains analyzed as well as number of mice analyzed per strain can be found in Table S1 . We also analyzed commonly used inbred C57BL/6 (B6) and BALB/c strains for comparison. In agreement with previous studies, we found wide variation in representation of immune cell subsets, including CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, Foxp3+ CD4 T cells, B cells, NK cells, granulocytes, and monocytes, and ratio of CD4 to CD8 T cells at steady state among CC strains examined in this study ( Figures 1A-1H ; Table S2 ). Of note, in all cases, subset representation was observed outside of ranges seen between B6 and BALB/c mice. Thus, immune cell composition at steady state among genetically diverse CC strains is variable, suggesting that diverse immune responses may be generated following infection.",

Additionally, our previous work with outbred mice has shown that quantitative and qualitative aspects of innate and adaptive immune responses following infection are variable among individual, genetically unique mice (Rai et al., 2009; Martin et al., 2017) . However, at present, there has been relatively little analysis of the immune response generated following infection of CC mice. To address this, we infected B6, BALB/c, and CC strains with Armstrong strain of LCMV (LCMV Arm), as the immune response following acute infection with this virus has been well described in B6 and BALB/c mice (Zhou et al., 2012; Lapo sov\u00e1 et al., 2013) . Following infection, we analyzed inflammatory cytokines present in serum at day 3 (d3) as a measure of the innate response, weight loss at d8 following infection, and CD4 and CD8 effector responses (CD4 T eff and CD8 T eff ) at d8 as a measure of the adaptive response ( Figure 2A ; Table S3 ). Concentrations of interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 detected in serum 3 days after infection varied from 30-to 100-fold among strains ( Figure 2B ), suggesting that the magnitude of innate responses elicited was different among CC strains. Additionally, weight loss 8 days after infection was variable ( Figure 2C ), suggesting that the infection was experienced differently among strains. We used previously described surrogate activation marker approaches (Rai et al., 2009; McDermott and Varga, 2011) to detect effector CD4 (CD4 T eff ) (CD49d hi /CD11a hi ) and CD8 (CD8 T eff ) (CD11a hi /CD8 lo ) responses at d8 (example dot plots shown in Figure S2 ), the peak of the adaptive response in B6 mice following LCMV infection. Magnitudes of CD4 T eff and CD8 T eff responses were strikingly different among strains, with CD4 T eff responses ranging from approximately 10% to over 90% of all CD4 T cells and CD8 T eff responses ranging from approximately 50% to close to 100% of all CD8 T cells ( Figures 2D and 2E) . Because CD8 T cell effector responses have been shown in B6 mice to be influenced by inflammatory cytokines (Busch et al., 2000; Curtsinger et al., 2005; Porter and Harty, 2006; Pham et al., 2009; Wirth et al., 2010) , we determined whether levels of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 detected in the serum at d3 correlated with CD8 T eff magnitude and found statistically significant correlations for both cytokines ( Figure 2F ). Thus, the magnitude of innate and adaptive immune responses following infection was correlated within strains but distinct among CC strains.",

Wide variation in CD8 T eff subset representation was observed among CC strains (Figures 3A and 3B; Table S3 ), suggesting that qualitatively different CD8 T eff cells are generated following infection in different strains. Because generation of SLEC and MPEC subsets has been shown to be influenced by aspects of the immune response to infection, including inflammation and CD8 T cell response magnitude (Joshi et al., 2007) , we determined whether representation of SLEC and MPEC subsets could be correlated with other aspects of the immune response. However, we did not find a significant correlation between percentage of SLECs or MPECs and either levels of systemic cytokines elicited or CD8 T eff response magnitude (Figures 3C and 3D) . Taken together, these data suggest that qualitatively and quantitatively different innate and effector immune responses are generated following infection in genetically distinct CC strains.",

            "text": "Following contraction, CD4 and CD8 T cells persist as memory cells that are capable of providing the host with increased protection against re-infection. Degree of memory CD8 Tcell-mediated protection against re-infection has been correlated with size of the memory CD8 T cell pool (Seder et al., 2013; Schmidt et al., 2008 Schmidt et al., , 2010 , and we previously noted that magnitude of the memory CD8 T cell pool generated following infection is highly variable in outbred mice (Rai et al., 2009; Martin et al., 2017) . Additional studies in humans have documented variation in size of the memory CD8 T cell pool generated in response to experimental vaccination (Akondy et al., 2017) , suggesting that memory CD8 T cell response magnitude is determined at least in part by host genetic makeup. To determine whether memory T cell pools of different sizes are generated in genetically distinct CC strains, we identified memory CD4 (CD4 T M ) (CD49d hi /CD11a hi ) and CD8 (CD8 T M ) (CD11a hi /CD8 lo ) T cells 75 days after LCMV infection ( Figure 4A ; Table S4 ; example dot plots shown in Figure S4 ). We found strikingly different sizes of CD4 and CD8 T M cell pools ranging from 1% to 8% (CD4 T M ) and 1% to 20% (CD8 T M ) of all lymphocytes in different CC strains ( Figures 4B-4D ). There was a statistically significant correlation with the size of the memory CD8 T cell pool generated and size of the effector response ( Figure  4E ), suggesting that the relative size of the memory pool generated could be predicted based on size of the CD8 T eff pool. Thus, T M pools of distinct sizes are generated in genetically diverse CC strains, which could impact degree of memory-mediated protection against reinfection, and the best predictor of CD8 T M cell pool size was size of the CD8 T eff pool generated.",

Circulating memory CD8 T cells were originally divided into subsets described as T effector memory (Tem), which do not express CD62L, are less proliferative, and more cytotoxic, and T central memory (Tcm), which express CD62L, home to secondary lymphoid organs, are more proliferative, and are better protective against chronic infections (Sallusto et al., 1999; Wherry et al., 2003) . More recently, Tem (Cx3Cr1 hi /CD27 lo ) and Tcm (Cx3Cr1 lo /CD27 hi ) subsets have been identified based on expression of Cx3Cr1 and CD27, which allows for identification of an additional memory subset described as peripheral memory (Tpm) (Cx3Cr1 int /CD27 hi ) that can circulate among peripheral tissues (Gerlach et al., 2016) . We and others have shown that the phenotype of memory CD8 T cells in inbred mice changes with time after infection such that the memory pool becomes highly represented by CD62L+ Tcm cells (Martin et al., 2015; Eberlein et al., 2016) . However, the rate of memory CD8 T cell phenotypic changes was variable in individual outbred mice (Martin et al., 2017) , suggesting that memory CD8 T cells generated in genetically unique organisms will differ qualitatively and in the ability to provide protection against re-infection.",

Expression of CD62L correlated with expression of other Tcmassociated markers CD127 and CD27 hi , and expression of CD62L was inversely correlated with Tem-associated markers KLRG1 and Cx3Cr1 ( Figure 5C ), suggesting that expression of CD62L is a good surrogate for true Tcm cells in any host. Interestingly, phenotypic diversity of memory CD8 T cells was greater among CC strains than B6 mice and similar to that seen in individual outbred NIH Swiss mice ( Figure 5D ), validating use of the CC as a model of diverse CD8 T cell memory outcomes following infection of genetically heterogeneous organisms. Additionally, these data suggest that heritable genetic factors may underlie development of T cell responses of distinct magnitude and/or quality following infection. To determine the heritability of CD4 and CD8 T eff and T M size and phenotypes of CD8 T eff and T M generated following infection that were quantified in Figures 2, 3 , 4, and 5, we used a broad sense heritability method to estimate the proportion of total variance contributed by genetic variance. This analysis showed that the genetic contribution was high among all phenotypes examined (Table S5) , which further suggested that genetic factors may underlie development of T cell responses of distinct magnitude and/or quality following infection.",

In an attempt to identify gene regions associated with quantitative measurements of the CD8 T cell response to infection, we performed QTL mapping on size of the CD8 T eff response ( Figure 2E ) and size of the CD8 T M pool generated ( Figure 4C ). For QTL scans, 1,000 permutations were run, and log of the odds ratio (LOD) scores above the 95 th percentile of the distribution were selected as significant QTLs. QTL intervals were then identified based on the LOD scores and effect of founder alleles in Diversity Outbred (DO) mice strains observed at those regions (Gatti et al., 2014) . We did not find significant QTLs associated with size of the CD8 T eff or T M pool (data not shown). However, linear correlation analysis revealed that size of the CD8 T M pool generated correlated with size of the T M pool ( Figure 4E ) and that size of the T eff pool generated correlated with levels of systemic cytokines elicited early during the response ( Figure 2F ). This suggests that host factors regulating the innate response to infection may play an important role in determining the magnitude of effector and memory CD8 T cells generated in hosts of diverse genetic backgrounds.",

Here, we did find significant QTLs associated with development of CD62L+ CD8 T M cells with LOD scores corresponding to p < 0.05 within chromosome 18 between 60 and 80 Mb-telomere regions and within chromosome 19 between 10 and 20 Mb-telomere regions ( Figure 6A ). The QTL intervals were determined using the Bayesian credible interval and represents the region most likely to contain the causative polymorphism(s) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11560912). Our analysis indicated that QTL regions with max LOD scores explained 61% of variance for generation of CD62L + CD8 T M cells. Analysis of founder effects did not reveal clear founder effects for QTLs associated with development of CD62L+ CD8 T M cells. However, NOD/ShiLtJ, CAST/EiJ, and NZO/HILtJ haplotypes between 60 and 80 Mb-telomere regions of chromosome 18 were associated with high frequency of CD62L+ CD8 T M cells although inheritance from A/J and PWK/PhJ was associated with low frequency ( Figure 6B ). Additionally, 129S1/ SvImJ and NZO/HILtJ haplotypes between 10 and 20 Mb-telomere regions of chromosome 19 were associated with high frequency of CD62L+ CD8 T M cells although inheritance from A/J, CAST EiJ, and PWK/PhJ was associated with low frequency ( Figure 6B ). CD62L+ CD8 T cells have classically been described as Tcm cells (Sallusto et al., 1999; Wherry et al., 2003) , but more recent subsetting strategies have also identified Tcm cells as Cx3Cr1 lo / CD27 hi (Gerlach et al., 2016) . Using this strategy to subset Tcm cells, we found a trending QTL associated with development of Tcm cells at the same region within chromosome 18 associated with development of CD62L+ T M cells ( Figure 6C ) that accounted for 50% of variance for generation of Tcm cells, providing further evidence that this chromosomal region is associated with the development of qualitatively distinct Tcm CD8 T cells.",

SNPs with LOD score greater than 3 were selected for the analysis of candidate genes. Further, we surveyed the significant SNPs to see whether those were present only in causal haplotypes or were commonly shared across all haplotypes. Within the QTL region on chromosome 18, we identified 209 SNPs that were shared in all haplotypes ( Figure S7A ; Table S6 ) and determined that SNPs within two candidate genes, Mbd2 and Dcc (Table 1) , could affect protein structure or function. Of 7 mutations near the gene region encoding for Mbd2, 3 were intronic, 2 were upstream, and 2 were downstream of the gene, although all SNPs associated with Dcc were intronic. SNPs identified in chromosome 19 QTL regions were present only in the haplotypes A/J, CAST/ EiJ, and PWK/PhJ, which were associated with low-fre quency CD62L+ CD8 T M cells ( Figure S7B ; Table S7 ). Candidate genes within the QTL regions of chromosome 19 that contained missense mutations included Ms4a3, Patl1, Gm22272, Olfr235, Olfr1434, Olfr1436, and Pfpl (Table 1) . Therefore, we have been able to characterize diverse adaptive immune responses within the CC reflective of outbred mice and the human population and identify gene regions and candidate genes driving this diversity. This further validates the usefulness of the CC as a translatable model that can identify complex interactions underlying unique immune responses following infection.",

These studies have also demonstrated the power of the CC as a tool to identify genetic factors underlying complex traits by using QTL mapping to identify gene regions and gene candidates driving differences in immune cell composition at steady state. Here, we further advance the utility of the CC by providing detailed analysis of the immune response following acute virus infection in 47 strains of CC mice. We corroborate previous findings of variation in immune subset composition among strains at steady state. Additionally, we describe wide variation in the magnitude of cytokines elicited during the adaptive immune response, size of the effector and memory T cell response, and phenotype and subset representation of effector and memory CD8 T cells generated following infection. This variation is similar to that seen in outbred mice (Rai et al., 2009; Martin et al., 2017) and that can be observed in the human population (Akondy et al., 2017) but that is not reflected in inbred B6 and BALB/c mice. We were also able to identify factors underlying qualitative and quantitative differences in the immune response following infection. Using linear correlation analysis, we demonstrate that magnitude of the memory CD8 T cell pool generated correlates with size of the effector pool generated and that effector pool size is correlated with levels of systemic cytokines elicited during the innate response. We also performed QTL mapping to identify gene regions and candidate genes driving the generation of CD62L+ Tcm CD8 T cells.",

Consequently, immunologists have sought to determine factors influencing size of the CD8 T cell pool generated following infection and have demonstrated that inflammation can affect CD8 T cell response magnitude (Busch et al., 2000; Curtsinger et al., 2005; Porter and Harty, 2006; Pham et al., 2009; Wirth et al., 2010) . Here, we have shown that the degree of inflammation elicited during the innate immune response to infection correlated with magnitude of the effector CD8 T cell response and that size of the effector response was a good predictor of memory CD8 T cell pool size. Importantly, levels of inflammation elicited during the innate response differed among CC strains. This suggests that the CC could be used to dissect factors influencing generation of inflammatory cytokines by cells of the innate arm of the immune system and how this impacts generation of memory CD8 T cells in genetically diverse organisms. Exploration of this kind could lead to improved knowledge of ways to improve the adaptive immune response following infection and/or vaccination in order to increase size of the memory CD8 T cell pool generated in hosts that do not generate sufficiently robust innate and/or adaptive immune responses.",

We found that phenotype and subset representation of memory CD8 T cells generated differed among collaborative cross strains, suggesting that qualitatively different memory CD8 T cells are generated within strains. CD62L+ Tcm cells are highly proliferative, become the dominant subset within the memory pool with time after infection, and provide enhanced protection compared to Tem cells following chronic viral infection (Sallusto et al., 1999; Wherry et al., 2003; Martin et al., 2015; Eberlein et al., 2016) . Through mapping analysis, we identified QTLs within chromosomes 18 and 19 and several candidate genes within these regions underlying the generation of CD62L+ memory CD8 T cells ( Figure 6 ; Table 1 ). Genes listed in Table 1 require further studies to determine whether and how their products may regulate development of CD62L+ memory as well as their mode of action. These genes could be acting intrinsically within CD8 T cells to influence development of CD62L+ memory CD8 T cells. However, Mbd2 is known to impact function of antigen-presenting cells and differentiation of CD4 T cells (Cook et al., 2015; Jia et al., 2017) , suggesting that genes of interest may act extrinsically by modulating function of other cell types that regulate priming of CD8 T cells and/or the cytokine milieu during the response. Therefore,examination of the impact of these genes of interest on development of CD62L+ Tcm cells will need to include careful analysis of CD8 T cells themselves as well as other cell types that may impact CD8 T cell differentiation.",

            "text": "In this study, we focused primarily on CD8 T cells found in circulation, but additional immune cell types shape the primary and memory-mediated responses to infection. Our analysis of the CD4 T cell response indicated that representation of CD4 T cells and of regulatory CD4 T cells at steady state differed among strains, as did magnitude of effector and memory CD4 T cell responses following infection. CD4 T cells differentiate into functionally distinct subsets following infection (DuPage and Bluestone, 2016), and differences in CD4 T cell differentiation following infection among strains, which was not examined here, have the potential to shape the inflammatory environment and to influence the development of CD8 T cell and B cell responses (Laidlaw et al., 2016; Crotty, 2015) . Furthermore, in addition to Tem, Tpm, and Tcm cells found in the circulation, memory CD8 T cells can persist as tissue resident memory (Trm) cells that provide protection against infections originating at barrier tissues (Mackay et al., 2012; Sl\u00fctter et al., 2013; Schenkel et al., 2013) . Trm cells differentiate from phenotypically and transcriptionally unique precursor cells within the circulation (Mackay and Kallies, 2017) , and data here that describe the generation of phenotypically distinct effector CD8 T cells among collaborative cross strains following LCMV infection suggest that strains may differ in their ability to form Trm populations. Therefore, the CC may be useful for modeling development of qualitatively unique adaptive immune responses following infection and for identification of factors driving differentiation of distinct B cell and CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets.",

Due to the number of mice required for this study, and because there is a limited amount of tissue that can be collected from a mouse for cellular analysis and the need to keep mice alive for an extended period of time to examine memory T cell responses, all CC strains in this study received the same infectious dose of virus and T cell responses were all analyzed at the same effector time point, which has been described as the peak of the response in B6 mice. Differences in kinetics and magnitude of early viral infection and clearance are known to affect the magnitude of T cell responses, and we were unable to determine whether there were differences in the course of infection among CC strains. Future studies should determine this and what role any differences in initial infection have on the CD8 T cell response. Additionally, because the CC strains possess different major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotypes, we were unable to analyze T cell responses of known epitope specificity. Future studies should examine T cell responses against bona fide epitopes, but this may require generation of recombinant inbred cross (RIX) lines that contain fixed MHC haplotypes capable of generating T cells recognizing known epitopes, such as the well-studied CD8 T cell response to the GP 33 epitope of LCMV. Additionally, differences in memory CD8 T cell response quantity and quality observed in this study suggest that CC strains may possess a differential ability to provide protection against secondary infection. This was not examined in this study but will be important to follow up on in future studies. However, this examination may also require adjustments to the model, as secondary LCMV infection is rapidly cleared due to the magnitude of the primary response. In this case, RIX mice may also be useful, as it would allow secondary infection with recombinant bacteria that have been engineered to express epitopes present in the organism used for the primary infection. Lastly, as was previously mentioned in the discussion, it will be important to isolate and test candidate genes driving generation of memory CD8 T cells of distinct quality identified in this study.",

Broad sense heritability method was used to estimate the proportion of genetic variance that contributed to total variance of observed parameters (Wray and Visscher, 2008) . LOD values for QTL mapping were determined using DOQTL version 1.19.0 Biocunductor package (Gatti et al., 2014) , and statistical significance of LOD scores was determined by a permutation test where genomic loci with scores above the threshold p value of 0.05 were selected as associated with QTLs with founder effects.",
