            "text": "Respiratory viruses are increasingly recognized as important causative pathogens in acute respiratory tract infections (RTI) in up to 50% of patients, depending on the season in which these viruses are detected [[1], [2], [3]]. Moreover, the number of immunocompromised patients is increasing due to ageing of the population, increased prevalence of chronic diseases as well as treatment with immunosuppressive agents [4,5]. Although immunocompromised patients have similar etiologies of acute RTI when compared to immunocompetent patients [6], they more often have a complicated course of the disease leading to high healthcare burden, especially in secondary and tertiary care settings [7,8]. Within the respiratory viral season, in-hospital isolation facilities are often falling short due to the high number of patients with suspected viral infections and immunocompromised patients with prolonged viral shedding [9,10]. Rapid and accurate detection of respiratory viruses by molecular diagnostics might lead to more targeted use of in-hospital isolation facilities [11] and improvement of other clinical outcomes due to more targeted antibiotic and antiviral therapy [12]. However, current evidence on the effect of implementation of rapid molecular testing on clinical outcomes and hospital resource use is heterogeneous and inconclusive. Most studies only focus on immunocompetent patients, do not specifically address the viral respiratory season, are of low quality due to their design or lack of proper adjustment for potential confounders [[13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]], whereas randomized studies [11,[23], [24], [25], [26]] evaluating effects within a research setting with perfect implementation of diagnostic assays, may lead to over-optimistic results.",

            "text": "During the first season, in-house real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used for the detection of respiratory viruses [28]. Nucleic acids were extracted using the total nucleic acid protocol with the MagNA Pure LC nucleic acid isolation system (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). For detection of RNA viruses using the Universal Master Mix, cDNA was synthesized first using MultiScribe RT and random hexamers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Detection of viral pathogens was performed in parallel, using laboratory developed RT-PCR assays specific for the following viruses: respiratory syncytial virus; influenza virus A and B; parainfluenza virus 1\u20134; rhinoviruses; bocaviruses; enteroviruses; adenoviruses; human coronaviruses OC43, NL63, and 229E; human metapneumovirus. Samples were assayed in a 25-\u03bcL reaction mixture containing 10 \u03bcL of cDNA/RNA, 12.5 \u03bcL of either TaqMan Fast virus 1-Step Master Mix, TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), or 2.5 \u03bcL primer-probe mix. Amplification was performed using a Taqman 7500 instrument (Applied Biosystems) in two different protocols. For the targets detected with the Fast virus 1-Step Master Mix (influenza virus, RSV, rhinovirus, enterovirus, parainfluenza virus type 1 and 3) the amplification profile was 5 min 50 \u00b0C, 20 s 95 \u00b0C, 45 cycles of 3 s 95 \u00b0C, and 30 s 60 \u00b0C. For the other targets the amplification profile was 2 min 50 \u00b0C, 10 min 95 \u00b0C, 45 cycles of 15 s 95 \u00b0C, and 1 min 60 \u00b0C. To monitor for inhibition, a fixed amount of an internal control virus (murine encephalomyocarditis virus [RNA virus] and porcine herpesvirus [DNA virus]) was added before extraction [29]. The cut-off value for a positive result was set at a Cycle threshold (Ct) value <45 [30]. Right before the second season we implemented a rapid molecular diagnostic test with a reported mean turnaround time of 2.3 h (SD 1.4 h) [11] - the FilmArray\u00ae respiratory viral panel version 1.7 (BioFire Diagnostics) - for simultaneous detection of a panel of respiratory viruses similar to the in-house RT-PCR. Additionally, the FilmArray\u00ae detects a couple of bacterial pathogens, Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, for which the assay however was not validated in our laboratory and results were neither reported for clinical practice nor for this study. The FilmArray\u00ae contains all needed reagents in a freeze-dried format for extraction, amplification, and detection steps. The FilmArray\u00ae test was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In brief, prior to run 1 ml of hydration solution and 300 \u03bcl of respiratory sample was added to the reagent pouch. The pouch was then placed on the FilmArray\u00ae instrument and the test performed using the FilmArray\u00ae system. After extraction and purification of all nucleic acids from the sample, a nested multiplex PCR is performed followed by an individual singleplex second-stage PCR reactions to detect the products from the first-stage nested PCR. The FilmArray\u00ae was available as diagnostic assay on weekdays between 8am-8pm and on weekend days and national holidays between 8\u201312 am. If samples were collected outside these opening hours, the rapid test was performed the following morning. Instructions on nasopharyngeal sampling were similar for the in-house RT-PCR and the FilmArray\u00ae and both tests were ordered by sending the sample plus application form to the clinical virology laboratory. All respiratory samples were collected in universal transport media and transported similarly, both the in-house RT-PCR and the FilmArray\u00ae were located in the clinical virology laboratory and handled in a standardized manner by trained technicians and all results were subsequently approved by a clinical virologist. Results of the rapid assay were directly reported to the treating physician by phone as were the positive test results of the in-house RT-PCR. In addition, results of both assays were reported in the electronic patient file.",

Implementation of these diagnostic interventions resulted in more targeted use of oseltamivir and in-hospital isolation facilities, without evidence of an increase in adverse outcomes. This is in line with a previous randomized study assessing the effect of rapid testing for respiratory viruses in mainly immunocompetent patients that observed an increase in oseltamivir use from 65% to 91% in influenza virus positive patients [11]. More targeted use of oseltamivir in influenza positive patients may not only lead to better individual patient outcomes [36], but may also lead to more rapidly decreased viral loads and thereby reduce secondary infections [37,38]. Additionally, the reduction of prescriptions in influenza virus negative patients (38% to 8%) may lead to less side effects [39]. A decrease in use of in-hospital isolation measurements, which is in line with the results of the same large randomized study [11], partially solves the recurrent logistical problem of a shortage in hospital beds during the crowded respiratory viral season. We did not perform an official costs-benefit analysis. However, based on the \u20achr concept [40] a substantial beneficial effect can be expected, since the rapid diagnostic test is as expensive as in-house RT-PCR in our setting and the implementation of specific instructions do not involve substantial costs, while the median turnaround time and isolation days are reduced considerably.",

The lack of significant results on these outcomes might be due to insufficient power of our study, and due to our vulnerable, immunocompromised patient population, in whom withholding or discontinuing antibiotic treatment is not according to (inter)national recommendations. Nevertheless, these results are in line with most former studies, mostly among immunocompetent patients, that also showed no reduction in antibiotic prescriptions [11,14,19,22,24,41,42]. Only two observational studies [15,16] showed a significant effect, but both validity and generalizability were problematic in these studies due to inadequate adjustment for potential confounders and specific patient selection [15]. The duration of antibiotic treatment was reduced in only one study among otherwise healthy children with uncomplicated acute RTI [14], whereas all studies among adult patients observed no effect [11,19,[24], [25], [26],41,43]. Even though most studies show no effect on antibiotics, there might still be potential for rapid molecular testing for respiratory viruses in antibiotic stewardship programs. This is supported by a randomized study that observed a significant reduction in single dose antibiotic prescriptions and antibiotics prescribed for less than 48 h [11]. Clear instructions or guidelines on whether to withhold antibiotics or to prescribe narrow spectrum antibiotics should however accompany the introduction of rapid molecular test for respiratory viruses to have maximum effect [43].",

The absence of a difference in adverse events between the two seasons was similar to other studies [11,14,16,21,24,43]. The increase in the length of patient ED stay, especially in non-admitted patients, might be explained by waiting time for rapid viral test results, although we had no formal numbers on the proportion of patients for whom the rapid test result was available before leaving the ED, e.g. for clinical and bed management decision making. However, given the intense and crowded viral season of 2017/2018 with twice as many patients as during the previous season, this might also have resulted from overall longer ED turnaround times during the second season. Anyhow, rapid acquirement of respiratory samples, subsequent transportation to the laboratory and sufficient capacity of the rapid diagnostic test might reduce turnaround times of the results and thereby waiting times at the ED.",

Other studies have focused on immunocompetent patients, which make former results less applicable in tertiary care centers with a large proportion of immunocompromised patients. Furthermore, with our non-randomized design in which the implementation of the rapid diagnostics for respiratory viruses during the second season was not 100%, we provide a truthful reflection of daily practice. Our study also has several limitations. First, given the before-after design of the study, outcomes can be biased due to residual confounders. However, we thoroughly adjusted our analyses for differences at baseline using a liberal p-value to select confounding factors and differences in viral pathogens for certain clinical outcomes. We thereby reduced the effect of confounders more thoroughly than former before-after studies on rapid molecular testing [[14], [15], [16], [17], [18],41]. Second, differences between the two seasons might also have been affected by trends in time not resulting from the diagnostic intervention per se. Adjustment for any possible trends in time with an interrupted time series analysis would have been appropriate. However, due to the short timeframe in this study and a limited number of patients per time point, this analysis was not feasible [44]. Also, we tried to maximize the potential effect of rapid testing by accompanying the implementation of this assay with specific instructions for the ED, by which we limited the possibility to distinguish the effect of the instructions and the rapid test as a sole intervention. Finally, our study was a single center study and clinical outcomes as antibiotic and antiviral prescriptions might be influenced by local protocols and guidelines, making results potentially less generalizable to other settings.",
