            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a severe emerging zoonotic disease. Since its initial identification in June 2012 in Saudi Arabia, MERS has caused 2090 infections and 730 deaths (case fatality rate: \u223c35%) in 27 countries as of November 2017 (WHO, 2017). MERS is caused by the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and belongs to the family of Coronaviridae, the genus \u00df-coronavirus. Like SARS-CoV that belongs in the same genus, MERS-CoV is a zoonotic disease that originates from bats, suggesting that bats are the most likely natural reservoir of MERS-CoV(Annan et al., 2013, Memish et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2014, Yang et al., 2014). Studies have confirmed the presence of MERS-CoV in dromedaries in the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa (Hemida et al., 2017, Kayali and Peiris, 2015, Reusken et al., 2013). Dromedaries are thought to be the main reservoir of MERS-CoV. Although transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to humans has not been reported to date, it has been postulated that primary human infection could result from close contact with camels, which shed the virus (Azhar et al., 2014). Of note, a major MERS outbreak in South Korea resulted in 186 cases, including 36 deaths in 2015. The majority of these cases were health care workers who were in close contact with infected patients (Korea Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2015). Thus developing a MERS vaccine that can provide rapid immune response for high-risk populations (such as health care workers) is of significant importance to public health.",

Here, we report a VSV-based chimeric recombinant virus, VSV\u0394G-MERS, in which VSV glycoprotein (G) gene was replaced by the MERS-CoV S gene. Single-dose immunization, either by the intramuscular or intranasal route, induced high-level and lasting MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses in rhesus monkeys. Our results demonstrate, therefore, the potential of VSV\u0394G-MERS as a candidate vaccine against MERS-CoV.",

Chemically synthesized MERS-CoV S gene (GenBank accession No. KF186567.1) was amplified by PCR and flanked by NheI restriction site., VSV gene-start and gene-end sequences were introduced. The PCR product was sequenced and cloned into the NheI site after the eGFP gene of pVSV\u0394G-eGFP (plasmid containing VSV genomic cDNA without G gene). The resultant plasmid was named pVSV\u0394G-eGFP-MERS. There were two MluI sites flanking the eGFP gene so construction of the pVSV\u0394G-MERS plasmid was achieved by MluI digestion and self-ligation. pVSV\u0394G-eGFP-MERS or pVSV\u0394G-MERS was co-transfected with a eukaryotic plasmid expressing VSV N, P and L protein, respectively, in BSR-T7/5 cells to rescue the recombinant virus. At 96 h post-transfection, the supernatant was harvested and clarified by low speed centrifugation, and serially passaged on Vero E6 cells for at least 3 passages until obvious green fluorescence or cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed. The rescued viruses were named VSV\u0394G-eGFP-MERS and VSV\u0394G-MERS respectively. The growth kinetics of the recombinant viruses was determined. VSV\u0394G-eGFP-MERS and VSV\u0394G-MERS were, respectively, inoculated at an MOI = 0.01 onto Vero E6 cells growing in a 6-well plate and the supernatant was removed at 12-h intervals from 12 h to 96 h. The samples of each time-point were titrated on Vero E6 cells using indirect immunofluorescence by staining with mouse anti-S serum and TRITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG as primary and secondary antibodies. The titer was expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution titer (fluorescence forming unit, FFU).",

Briefly, siRNA (200 nM, 5 \u03bcl per well) targeting to DPP4, clathrin, VSV L gene (positive control) or irrelevant siRNA (negative control, Ambion cat no. 4390843) was pre-arrayed on 96-well cell carrier plates (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA), respectively. Next, 35 \u03bcl OptiMEM medium (Invitrogen, Oregon, USA) containing 0.15 \u03bcl Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Oregon, USA) was mixed with 60 \u03bcl OptiMEM medium containing 1 \u00d7 104 Vero E6 cells. The cell-RNAiMAX mix was then added to the wells. Cells were incubated for 48 h to knockdown gene expression, after which the cells were infected with VSV\u0394G-eGFP-MERS or VSV-eGFP at an MOI = 0.01. At 48 h post-infection (15 h for VSV-eGFP), cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and stained with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen, Oregon, USA) in PBS for 1 h. Stained cells were imaged by PerkinElmer Operetta high-content system (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Uninfected cells served as the reference population for background fluorescence. Fifty-two fields per well were imaged at 20 \u00d7 magnification. Columbus software (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) was used to automatically identify and quantify green fluorescence and cell nuclei. The infection ratio was determined according to the numbers of infected versus non-infected cells. The assay was independently repeated three times.",

Ten days after immunization, monkey blood was drawn from lower extremity veins under anesthesia. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were separated by monkey lymphocyte separation buffer (TBD sciences, Tianjin, China). To ensure adequate cell numbers, monkey PBMCs from the same group were pooled. A synthetic overlapping peptide pool spanning the whole MERS-CoV S protein, which consisted of 269 peptides (15mers with 10 amino acid overlapped, designed for CD8+ T cells) was used to evaluate the specific CD8+ T cell responses. Briefly, Millipore 96-well HTS HA sterile plates (Millipore, USA) were coated with 4 \u03bcg/ml purified mouse anti-human IFN-\u03b3 (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) in 0.1 ml PBS at 4 \u00b0C.

Results showed all mice were healthy and did not exhibit untoward clinical signs. Body weight gain was similar between the experimental and the PBS control group mice for two weeks post-inoculation (Fig. 6\nA). We then evaluated VSV\u0394G-MERS-induced humoral immune responses for S protein-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies. Results showed high levels of specific IgG were detectable after the initial inoculation (measured day 14, 13 \u03bcg/ml), and specific IgG was significantly boosted after the second dose on day 21 (measured day 35, 20 \u03bcg/ml) (p < .05) (Fig. 6B). MERS neutralizing antibody was also detected after the first dose, and was significantly boosted after the second dose (p < .05) (Fig. 6C). Due to the fact that mice cannot be infected by VSV\u0394G-MERS, as they do not express human DPP4, these results demonstrated the potential of VSV\u0394G-MERS to serve as an inactivated MERS vaccine.",

Monkey MERS S protein neutralizing antibodies were induced after i.m or i.n immunization, and were detected on day 10 post immunization, reaching peak level at day 21 (Fig. 7B). The neutralizing antibody titer of i.m group was significantly higher than that of the i.n group at both time-points (Fig. 7B), indicating that the i.m route might better facilitate the production of neutralizing antibodies in the case of VSV\u0394G-MERS immunization in monkeys.",

Of note, an MVA vectored vaccine was highly immunogenic and could significantly reduce the MERS-CoV excretion in dromedary camels (Haagmans et al., 2016). A measles virus vectored vaccine was also highly immunogenic and protective in human DPP4-transgenic mice (Malczyk et al., 2015). These results clearly demonstrate the great potential of a live-vectored vaccine. However, all of these are vaccines that require multiple dosing to generate desired immune responses, thus are not ideal in emergencies that necessitate rapid immune responses to emerging infectious diseases like MERS. By contrast, a single dose of VSV\u0394G-MERS immunization would suffice to induce ideal immune response.",

Thus in the present study we constructed VSV\u0394G-MERS by deploying the same strategy. The rescued virus manifested delayed growth kinetics and decreased peak titer compared with the native vector virus (Fig. 2). S protein was, therefore, the sole viral membrane anchored glycoprotein instead of VSV G protein, and was critical in receptor binding and viral entry. Furthermore, the incorporation of S protein did not alter the morphology of the virus (bullet shaped virions, Fig. 3), but it did obviously alter the tropism and entry of the virus. The recombinant virus required human DPP4 as its cellular receptor (Fig. 4A and B). The S protein also influenced the entry mode of the recombinant virus, as shown in Fig. 1B, as significant syncytia formation was observed in VSV\u0394G-MERS and VSV\u0394G-eGFP-MERS-infected Vero E6 cells, but not in VSV-infected cells. This observation indicated that the virus utilized direct membrane fusion to enter cells, which was in accordance with the previous study that showed that MERS-CoV could enter the cells partially via direct membrane fusion (Qian et al., 2013). Our results further demonstrated clathrin played an important role in VSV\u0394G-eGFP-MERS entry, as shown in Fig. 5, where knocking down clathrin expression by siRNA in Vero E6 cells largely reduced the infection rate of VSV\u0394G-eGFP-MERS. This result indicated the recombinant virus could enter cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which is in agreement with studies showing MERS-CoV could enter cells either by direct membrane fusion or by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (de Wit et al., 2016).",

Theoretically, Balb/c mice cannot be infected by VSV\u0394G-MERS due to the lack of human DPP4, thus the recombinant virus was similar to an inactivated vaccine or virus-like particle vaccine for mice. Our results showed that VSV\u0394G-MERS induced a robust humoral immune response in mice after a two-dose i.m immunization. Most importantly, our results demonstrated that a single i.m or i.n inoculation dose could induce effective humoral and T cell responses in rhesus monkeys. Quantitative ELISA results showed that recombinant virus induced high level of S protein specific IgG in both groups, and no statistical difference existed between i.m and i.n groups at any time-point. However, results for the neutralizing antibodies were quite different where the i.m group demonstrated significantly higher levels of neutralizing antibodies than the i.n group at all time-points. While i.m inoculation was more effective in generating neutralizing antibodies than the i.n route, the levels of serum neutralizing antibodies following i.n inoculation were significantly higher than baseline and not trivial. We, therefore, suggest that in future application, a single dose vaccine can be given via both the i.n and i.m routes to ensure solid immunity. In the present study, we were unable to carry out a viral neutralizing assay using MERS-CoV due to the unavailability of MERS-CoV per se, thus we used VSV\u0394G-eGFP-MERS to mimic MERS-CoV to determine the neutralizing titers. This method was similar to that used with the S protein bearing pseudo-viruses, such as lentiviral particles (Grehan et al., 2015, Jaume et al., 2011); while VSV\u0394G-eGFP-MERS is replication competent, it is more stable and suitable for the neutralizing antibody assay. To date, several MERS-CoV animal models have been reported, including rhesus macaques (de Wit et al., 2013, Munster et al., 2013, Yao et al., 2014), common marmosets (Falzarano et al., 2014), DPP4 transgenic mice (Agrawal et al., 2015, Pascal et al., 2015) and DPP4-expressing adenovirus transduced mice (Zhao et al., 2014). Due to the unavailability of MERS-CoV, a monkey challenge study could not be undertaken in the current study setting but will be undertaken in a future study. Considering the neutralizing antibody levels generated and the correlation between neutralizing antibody and protection, we speculate that the VSV\u0394G-MERS vaccine will confer protection against MERS-CoV.",
