Bronchoalveolar lavage to obtain fl uid from a small part of the lung via bronchoscopy is suitable for patients with life-threatening CAP or worsening pneumonia despite antimicrobial therapy.

Firstly, inhalation causes pneumonia due to microorganisms that can remain suspended in air and evade local host defenses. In addition, aerosolization is the route of infection by intracellular bacteria such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Chlamydophila spp., Coxiella burnetii , and Legionella pneumophila [ 6 , 8 , 9 ] . Secondly, aspiration of oropharyngeal fl ora can cause CAP. The ability of virulent bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae , Staphylococcus aureus , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and Klebsiella pneumoniae to colonize the oropharynx is determined by the interaction of specifi c microbial adhesins with cellular receptors. For example, components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) such as fi bronectin in oral mucus promote the adherence of viridans streptococci . In contrast, salivary fi bronectin prevents colonization by Gram-negative bacilli, and decreased levels of fi bronectin due to alcoholism, diabetes, malnutrition, and other severe comorbidities might contribute to an increased CAP risk. The presence of local immunoglobulins, particularly immunoglobulin A (IgA), complement, and normal fl ora also prevents colonization of the oropharynx by virulent organisms [ 6 , 8 , 9 ] .",

Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to improve pulmonary gas exchange in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to vasodilatation in ventilated lung areas where exogenous NO has easy access. As a result, blood fl ow is redistributed from non-ventilated to ventilated alveolar units, thereby reducing intrapulmonary shunts. Inhaled low doses of NO thus improve arterial oxygenation allowing to gain time for the effect of antibiotics [ 24 ] .",
