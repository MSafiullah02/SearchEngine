Forty-three flocks (27 of breeding hens and 16 of laying hens) were sampled monthly during their economic life (from 18\u201320 weeks to 55\u201365 weeks of age). One environmental swab and one pool of faecal samples were collected monthly for bacteriological examination. The environmental swab was a sterile piece of cloth pre-dampened in BPW and used to collect the dust on the maximum of materials in the building. The faecal samples consisted of 60 individual recent faeces evenly collected on the ground or on the faeces conveyor belts. For the serological examination, different samples were collected monthly: 20 yolks were sampled from flocks of laying hens and 20 sera were analysed in flocks of breeding hens. This number of samples was calculated in order to detect at least one seropositive bird in a flock with a minimum of 15% infected animals. The risk of not detecting this infection was 5% (Toma et al., 2001).",

Indeed, out of the 36 flocks without SE or ST, nine were seropositive. So, this ELISA was not specific for SE or ST, as sera from conventional animals raised in batteries and in contact with various serovars were found positive. Some of these serovars share common antigens with SE or ST, like S. Agona and S. Heidelberg; but others do not, like S. Hadar. Differences in stimulation of the immune system may also be related to the invasive potential of each strain (Desmidt et al., 1998, Roy et al., 2001). These three serovars isolated in our study from breeder flocks were also probably transmitted via the eggshells to the progeny in the hatchery. Indeed, the owners of the breeder flocks infected with S. Heidelberg and S. Hadar involved in this study (Table 4) reported that the corresponding broiler flocks were frequently infected with the same serovars. Positive serological reactions may also be explained by the possible presence of SE or ST hidden by other serovars in the same sample, as described by Van Winsen et al. (1999) on artificially infected pigs. The serovars Agona, Heidelberg and Hadar are not currently included in the French legislation. Although they have not the same importance as SE and ST in food poisoning, outbreaks related to these three serovars are reported in different countries (Synnott et al., 1998, Bisbini et al., 2000, Van Look et al., 2000, Lindqvist et al., 2002, Demczuk et al., 2003, Hennessy et al., 2004).",

This phenomenon was particularly observed for one of the laying hen flocks infected with SE (Table 5, flock 2). SE was also recovered in two flocks of breeding hens but apparently without massive infection of the birds, since the serological results in these two flocks were always negative. In one of the flocks infected with ST (Table 6, flock 1), there were several consecutive positive bacteriological results but only one positive serological result. In this flock, ST was probably established in the environment without a large infection of the hens at the time of slaughtering. With regards to the second flock infected with ST, the absence of positive serological results could be explained by the slaughtering of the hens before the infection of birds occurred. In the third flock, the serology became positive 1 month after the first detection of ST by bacteriological method. This result could not be confirmed because the flock reached the end of its economic life and the hens had to be slaughtered.",

If a country decides to use a serological method in its surveillance system, a positive response in a flock without any vaccination against Salmonella will need further bacteriological examination. This confirmation remains necessary because of a possible non-specific response of the ELISA which may lead to an unjustified chicken slaughtering and an economic loss for the farmer. The bacteriological confirmation is also necessary for epidemiological reasons (Skov et al., 2002) and regulations: Enteritidis and Typhimurium are currently the only two serovars targeted by the French authorities. Other serovars could be targeted since the European Regulation 2160/2003 (Anonymous, 2003).
