This is of particular importance since modern, family-centered neonatal care that includes kangaroo care and units that are always open to parents and siblings bears an increased risk of virus transmission. In our study, viral infections always presented with respiratory symptoms, albeit their clinical characteristics were highly heterogeneous. When compared with bacterial infections, nosocomial viral infections occurred rather late during birth hospitalization. It is unclear whether this is due to physiological factors, such as decreasing maternal passive immunity or simply due to long-term hospitalization. Affected infants were either extremely premature infants or term infants with a pulmonary or thoracic disease that presented with respiratory distress. These might be the patients at high risk in whom viral testing should definitely be considered in cases of suspected late-onset sepsis.",

A comparable incidence of 6% of viral respiratory infections in cases of sepsis evaluation in the NICU was observed. Likewise, rhinovirus, which is a member of the picornavirus family, was the dominating pathogen. Bennett et al performed a surveillance study of viral respiratory infections in two NICUs. All infants of a gestational age < 33 weeks were tested twice a week using multiplex RT-PCR ELISA. The authors found that 52% of all tested infants had a positive virus screen at least once during their birth hospitalization. In contrast to our study, they identified infants with a positive virus screen who had no or only minimal clinical symptoms.17 Another study by Gonzalez-Carrasco et al used a mixed design of weekly surveillance and additional tests in the event of respiratory symptoms.19 In that study, 9.3% of all samples were positive. A total of 13 infants were affected, and 9 of them were symptomatic. Again, rhinovirus was most frequently found (79% of the cases).",

Their results suggest that RSV, human metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza virus are likely to be causative, if detected in symptomatic infants. The detection of other viruses such as rhinovirus, adenovirus, or enterovirus requires prudent evaluation since they were frequently found in asymptomatic infants.22 This is in contrast to previous studies suggesting that picornaviruses/rhinoviruses are major causative pathogens in infants with lower respiratory tract infection.23\n24 Rhinovirus may be detectable for up to 5 to 6 weeks following infection,21 but shorter clearance of around 2 weeks has also been described.24 Since active shedding and clearance occurs, repeated detection of rhinovirus may rather reflect resolving or subclinical upper respiratory tract infection than colonization.

            "text": "In large-scale future studies, a screening cohort of asymptomatic infants and serial quantitative PCR analyses might help to evaluate whether clinical deteriorations may be caused by a reactivation of a persisting subclinical viral infection. To allow for discrimination of harmless colonization and true infection, a future study would ideally consist of three cohorts: (1) asymptomatic virus negative, (2) asymptomatic virus positive, and (3) symptomatic virus positive. The additional implementation of host-based RT-PCR gene expression assays into clinical practice might offer a significantly improved tool to diagnose viral infections.25 Furthermore, the range of viruses, which can be screened for, should be expanded. Quite recently, a study with a comparable design investigated human parechovirus in blood samples of all cases of suspected late-onset sepsis in the NICU and found a high infection rate of 13%.26 Further research should also focus on modes of virus transmission, patients at risk, and the impact of preventive measures and long-term outcomes of viral infections during birth hospitalization.",
