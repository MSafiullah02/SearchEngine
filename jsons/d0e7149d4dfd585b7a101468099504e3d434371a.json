For instance, the acute renal failure trial network (ATN) study included more than 1000 patients with severe AKI and showed that intensive RRT strategies (more frequent intermittent hemodialysis or higher dose of continuous hemofiltration) did not improve mortality [4] . A post hoc analysis of this trial [5] , concluded that more intensive modalities were associated with a greater reduction in urine output during the first 7 days of therapy. In the subgroup of hemodynamically stable patients [6] who received intermittent RRT, increasing frequency from 3 to 6 days per week was associated with impaired renal recovery at day 28. An individual patient data meta-analysis of 8 RCTs (on both continuous and intermittent RRT) confirmed that higher RRT intensity delayed renal function recovery [7] .",

Such discordant clinical data could reflect persistence of some biological incompatibility whichever the type of membrane: increased platelet activation was observed with so-called \"biocompatible\" hydrophobic membranes (polysulfone, polymethyl methacrylate), leading to platelets-neutrophils micro-aggregate formation that produced oxidative stress [17] .

            "text": "Course of acute kidney injury over time.(1) Preventive action can be taken when acute kidney injury (AKI) is discovered at an early stage, and progression to the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT; dotted blue line) can potentially be avoided (full black line).(2) During recovery from AKI, the kidneys are more susceptible to further injury, which can result in new deterioration of renal function (full black line) rather than recovery (green line). (3) Patients can recover their kidney function after starting RRT (full blue line). This recovery is often incomplete, which can result in progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) and eventually end-stage kidney disease (ESKD; full lilac line). (4) Patients who have had a second AKI hit rarely recover their kidney function completely (full blue line), and have an increased risk of progressive CKD and evolution to ESKD over time (full lilac line). The concept of artificial kidney-induced kidney injury would imply that RRT might constitute this second hit.
