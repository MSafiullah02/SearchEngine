A number of events have highlighted the importance of PPE for first responders and health care workers. The 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Epidemic, the 2009 H1N1 Influenza Pandemic, the 1995 Tokyo Subway Sarin Attack, the 1995 Murrah Federal Building Bombing in Oklahoma City, and the terrorist attacks of September 2001 are some examples of situations in which the lack of proper PPE or the improper use of it resulted in adverse health effects for health care providers. Such events and adverse outcomes have focused attention on PPE as a critical issue in routine emergency department operations and disaster response.",

This attack resulted in 12 deaths and more than 4000 persons presenting to the hospital for medical evaluation. None of the casualties was decontaminated before treatment or transport. Retrospectively, 135 prehospital and 100 hospital personnel reported symptoms consistent with nerve agent exposure. Fortunately, none required emergency treatment.1 Eleven physicians caring for the sickest victims (including one in cardiac arrest and one in respiratory arrest) were most affected, and six of them required treatment with specific antidote. All recovered fully and did not have to cease their patient care efforts because of symptoms.2 Approximately 80% of victims self-referred to hospitals, which is consistent with U.S. experiences, indicating that few victims of chemical contamination events undergo decontamination before arrival at a medical facility.3\n,\n4 This has caused most jurisdictions to reconsider historical plans that contaminated patients would not be in contact with medical care personnel until they were \u201cclean.\u201d EMS and hospital personnel need to be prepared for contaminated patients presenting directly to them and recognize that in certain situations PPE may be required to safely provide care.",

This novel viral agent with incompletely defined transmission characteristics was controlled in 2002, with aggressive quarantine measures and use of PPE. In the first wave of SARS in Toronto, 79.2% of all cases were acquired in a health care setting.5 Aggressive use of PPE, including N95 masks, barrier precautions, and gloves, was generally effective at preventing spread, although during one difficult and prolonged intubation attempt, at least 6 providers contracted SARS from a patient, despite complying with PPE recommendations.6 This case led to recommendations that higher levels of PPE may be required during procedures that are likely to generate aerosols or provoke coughing, such as intubation, airway suctioning, positive pressure ventilation, and nebulized treatments.7 Many of the lessons learned from the SARS epidemic, including the importance of appropriate respiratory PPE and compliance programs, were later applied to the 2009 H1N1 Influenza Pandemic. Even so, H1N1 took a toll on health care workers, and analysis of both of these events has led to future improvements for disaster preparedness.8, 9, 10, 11, 12\n",

The report, titled Protecting Emergency Responders: Lessons Learned from Terrorist Attacks, describes in detail many of the challenges responders faced (Box 46-1\n).13\nBox 46-1Historical Hazards Faced by Responders to Terrorism Events\n\u2022Physical hazards including fires, burning jet fuel and explosions, rubble piles with sharp rebar and heated metal, falling debris (which resulted in the death of a nurse in Oklahoma City), hazardous materials, electrical hazards, structures prone to collapse, heat stress, exhaustion, and respiratory irritants\u2022Heat-related seizures while wearing chemically protective suits\u2022Eye injuries (usually related to particulate exposure), which accounted for 12% of all WTC disaster response worker injuries\u2022Potential for secondary hazards, including explosive devices and chemical, biological, and radioactive agents\u2022PPE shortcomings:\u2022Heavy helmets hindered performance\u2022SCBA was heavy and cumbersome\u2022SCBA face pieces fogged (reducing visibility), and the equipment hindered verbal and radio communication\u2022SCBA air bottle made it difficult to enter small spaces, and the limited air supply (up to 1 hour) necessitated leaving the operation to exchange the air bottle\u2022Air tanks and/or filters were not interchangeable between teams, and teams worked under different standards\u2022PAPR filters became clogged and were uncomfortable for long-duration use. Many workers instead opted to use dust masks (which offered little protection and caused nose-bridge chafing) or to wear the masks/hoods around their necks (\u201cneck protectors\u201d)\u2022Use of respirators made it difficult for workers to communicate with each other, often resulting in users breaking the face seal to talk\u2022Turnout gear (the common protective garments used by firefighters) increased heat stress and physical fatigue\u2022At the WTC, the rubble pile was so hot in places that it melted the soles of workers\u2019 boots; providing wash stations to cool the boots resulted in wet feet and serious blisters for many workers; some 440 WTC disaster response workers sought treatment for blisters\u2022Steel-reinforced boots (soles and toes) protected against punctures by sharp objects but conducted and retained heat, which contributed to blisters and burns\u2022Structural firefighting gloves worked well until they got wet and hardened, reducing their dexterity\u2022WTC disaster response workers did not consistently protect their hands against potential hazards such as human remains and bodily fluids\u2022Safety glasses were readily available but often were open at the sides and did not offer adequate protection against airborne particles\u2022Goggles were uncomfortable, hindered peripheral vision, tended to fog, and did not fit well in conjunction with half-face respirators\u2022Many disaster response workers at the WTC (especially law enforcement officers) did not consistently use hearing protection, even around heavy machinery, because they needed to hear their radios and voices and listen for tapping when they were searching for survivors\n\u2022Most volunteers at the WTC, Pentagon, and Oklahoma City did not receive pre-event training on PPE and hazardous materials\u2022Although firefighters generally received detailed pre-event training, this was less true for law enforcement officers\u2022Accurate \u201creal-time\u201d hazard information was not readily available, especially during the anthrax incidents\u2022Protection from falls was available at some sites (in the form of ropes and harnesses) but was inconsistently used\n",

Of these secondary contamination victims, only two had employed any PPE when the contamination occured.22 Even though secondary contamination events are relatively rare, they pose significant risk to health care providers and to the entire health care system because emergency departments and transport vehicles may be closed or taken out of service for proper decontamination. Events resulting in emergency department evacuation and/or provider illness are especially serious in situations of \u201coff-gassing,\u201d where toxic gases are released from contaminated patients and/or their clothing.23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 The most serious of these incidents involve patients with suicidal ingestions of organophosphate pesticides.23, 24, 25 Exposures to these patients have caused at least one provider to require intubation and receive aggressive treatment with specific antidote because of contact with pesticide in emesis and vapors during patient resuscitation.23 Patients who have ingested organophosphate may \u201coff-gas\u201d for days and present an ongoing risk to health care workers.25 In conjunction with the information from the Tokyo Subway Sarin Attack and the chemical terrorism risk posed by these agents, it is clear that these pesticides present a substantial risk of toxicity from secondary exposures.",

Generally, as the level of protection increases (Level A being the highest level), so do the weight, cost, and physiological burden of the appropriate PPE. Increasing protection also generally means decreasing mobility, dexterity, and scope of vision. Inherent risks to PPE include trip and fall hazards, reduced ability to complete tasks, heat stress, anxiety, and seizures.28\n,\n33, 34, 35, 36, 37 Cardiovascular demand is dramatically increased as ensemble weight and heat retention increase. PPE must be selected on the basis that it does not impose unnecessary risks to the provider while at the same time offering an appropriate margin of safety against the hazard. Because the selection of PPE usually revolves around the selection of the respiratory component, various types of respirators must be reviewed. Each respirator has an assigned protection factor that reflects the degree of protection afforded to the user. Simply put, 1/protection factor equals the amount of exposure for the wearer. For example, a provider wearing a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) with an assigned protection factor (APF) of 1000 is exposed to 1/1000 the level of contaminant as compared with wearing no protection.",

There is experimentally developed PPE that are easier to don and doff, and which provide improved mobility and visibility to perform procedures. In one project completed at Brown University in conjunction with the Rhode Island School of Design, engineering and industrial design students paired up to develop a new model of Level B PPE that could be donned in half the time with a single user compared to two users with traditional PPE. Even though a prototype was developed and showcased, there were no clear funding sources available to bring this design to market.54 Technology change is occurring far more rapidly than the current approvals process and new standards that have arisen in the wake of recent events. Clear guidance on appropriate technologies for warm-zone activities is lacking at this time. This can lead to confusion and difficult choices for agencies and facilities, knowing that their PPE selection may be either too much or too little to satisfy future standards. Currently, there is no recommendation or consensus on the level of PPE that is required for hospital-based personnel, much to the consternation of hospital preparedness leaders. Some have proposed a PPE Level H to meet this need. Additional research is clearly needed regarding safe but comfortable PPE, methods of decontamination, modeling of airborne concentrations of specific agents, and PPE selection.",
