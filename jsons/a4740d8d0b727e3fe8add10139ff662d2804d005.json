In order to combat the pandemic, several countries worldwide enforced mitigation measures in the forms of lockdowns, social distancing and disinfection measures. In an effort to understand the dynamics of this disease, we propose a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based model. We train our model on over three months of cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths. Our model can be adjusted based on the parameters in order to provide predictions as needed. We provide results at both the country and county levels. We also perform a quantitative comparison of mitigation measures in various counties in the United States based on the rate of difference of a short and long window parameter of the proposed LSTM model. The analyses provided by our model can provide valuable insights based on the trends in the rate of infections and deaths. This can also be of help for countries and counties deciding on mitigation and reopening strategies. We believe that the results obtained from the proposed method will contribute to societal benefits for a current global concern.",

The virus was named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) and the disease caused due to it was named the COrona VIrus Disease . The most common symptoms are cough and fever, although symptoms range in severity including pneumonia-like symptoms and dyspnea [1] . It was confirmed that COVID-19 spread through infected respiratory droplets transmitted from an infected person to a healthy person [2] . Other symptoms in humans have been studied, including relations to the gastrointestinal system [3] and skin rashes [4] . More recent studies have focused on other possible zoonotic pathways, including other species that can possibly contract COVID-19 [5] .",

The window parameters we specifically focus on in this case are the lookback and lookahead parameters which are tuned based on the data of a particular location. In this case, the lookback parameter is indicative of the window size in terms of the number of consecutive days the LSTM needs to \"look back\" at in order to make a reasonable prediction. The lookahead parameter indicates the number of days in advance that the system needs to \"look ahead\" in order to make a prediction for a future date. In general, the model is able to provide future predictions of confirmed cases/deaths.

However, the actual number of COVID-19 cases in the entire nation seems to be increasing despite some states implementing social distancing measures as early as March.

We now aim at understanding how well the current mitigation measures are working. Various countries placed nationwide lockdowns, while others implemented phased strategies based on affected individual locations. The goal is to understand how social distancing had made the situation better or worse. The analyses provided are based on our proposed LSTM model. In order to do this, we consider a shorter and longer window size. In this context, we fix the lookback parameter and use the line of best fit on the rate of change of the difference between the smaller lookahead parameter of 1 and a larger lookahead parameter of 5. The analyses can also be carried out on individual parameters, however, for experimental purposed we choose to compute the rate on the difference in order to obtain a smoother curve for the purpose of this work. Again, the model can be used for this type of analyses for the near future as well, which will be valuable for nations or specific locations to decide whether to tighten or loosen restrictions based on the trend of how well their mitigation policies will work in the near future. 10 .

Countries took vital steps in mitigating the pandemic by enforcing lockdowns, social distancing, and a variety of other mitigation measures. In this paper, we propose an LSTM based learning model that can learn from the cumulative rise in COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths and provide valuable insights on how well mitigation measures are working quantitatively in terms of the rate of infections and deaths. The predictions of the model can be helpful for countries deciding to make important decisions regarding the effects of currently implemented mitigation measures and aid in making plans for reopening various places. We provide analyses at both the country and county levels.",

New York was one of the most heavily affected areas of the United States. Counties in New York enforced lockdowns in March similar to most other places of the United States [39].

In other words, a positive slope indicates an increase in the rate of infections or deaths while a negative slope indicates a decrease in the rate of infections or deaths. The intercept gives an approximation of the increase/decrease in the rate of infections or deaths depending on a positive/negative value. The RMSE gives an estimate of the stabilization of the rate of infections/deaths. Mitigation measures New York City, New York have worked well in terms of lowering the rate of infections as well as deaths. Mitigation measures in Cook, Illinois are working in terms of infections even though deaths show an increasing trend, so prolonged mitigation measures may be needed. Mitigation measures are also yet to work in Fulton, Georgia based on the increasing trend of infections. However, mitigation and social distancing measures have worked in King, Washington as indicated by the declining rates of both infections and deaths. Mitigation measures are also yet to work in Los Angeles, California.
