Infections with hMPV and RSV occur worldwide and are associated with a broad clinical spectrum ranging from mild to life-threatening disease. Our group and others have shown that hMPV infections in hospitalized patients or in the elderly are at least as severe as RSV infections [125, 146, 147, 175, 178, 204\u2013206, 218, 220, 221, 229]. Whether hMPV infections cause milder symptoms than RSV infections in otherwise healthy individuals has not yet been systematically investigated. Furthermore, hMPV and RSV often occur as co-pathogens and may then cross-react directly or indirectly [229].",

Further cases were described after lung and heart\u2013lung transplantation in patients having histological findings of acute pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage and hyaline membrane formation [112, 192]. In hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients, hMPV can cause life-threatening disease. Englund and colleagues described a case series in which the hMPV detection rate by RT-PCR was about 26% among symptomatic patients, and 80% of hMPV-positive patients died from severe infection [63]. Furthermore, in stem-cell transplant recipients, viral shedding and persistence may be prolonged compared to otherwise healthy individuals and may be accompanied by severe infection characterized by rapidly progressive pneumonia with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [50, 63]. Until now, ribavirin has been the only antiviral agent used to treat severe hMPV infections [28, 85, 93, 165]. Ribavirin was tested in a mouse model and used successfully in two published clinical cases. To date, no other antivirals or vaccines are available.",

The newly found virus showed up as a possible cause of respiratory disease, particularly acute respiratory tract infections. Clinical symptoms include coughing, fever, and rhinorrhea. It is still unclear whether HBoV is able to trigger disease on its own or occurs only as a co-pathogen [176].",

            "text": "Comparisons of the genomic sequence to other known viruses suggest that HBoV may belong to the Parvoviridae family, Parvovirinae subfamily, and Bocavirus genus. This genus has two other viruses, namely, bovine parvovirus (BPV) and canine minute virus (CnMV). HBoV may be the second Parvoviridae known to cause human disease, after parvovirus B19, which belongs to the Erythrovirus genus. Several nonpathogenic parvoviruses are also known to infect humans, including the adeno-associated viruses (AAV) of the parvovirus family, Dependovirus genus, and, in the same family, parvovirus 4 (PARV4), a possible member of the Hokovirus genus [113]. Two new viruses classified as HBoV2 and HBoV3 were discovered recently. HBoV2 has 75% similarity to HBoV, compared to only 18% for HBoV3 and HBoV2 [12, 100]. HBoV2 was detected in children with acute gastroenteritis in England, Pakistan, and Australia, whereas HBoV3 was detected during the course of an HBoV2 surveillance program but could not be associated to any symptoms [12].",

            "text": "HBoV is a non-enveloped single-stranded DNA virus, encapsulated in a simple icosahedral shell with a diameter of 20\u201326 nm, made up by the arrangement of two proteins. The main genome body containing the open reading frames (ORFs) encoding viral proteins has been sequenced and shown to be 5,309 nt in length [115]. The entire genome length is predicted to be about 6,000 nt [8, 9]. Experiments to directly sequence the virus genome failed and led to faulty data [9, 27]. HBoV is thought to have palindromic hairpin structures flanking the terminal ends, similar to related Parvoviridae (e.g., BPV and CnMV). The function of the terminal folds is not fully understood, but it is thought that they act as primers in viral replication and are important for packaging [101]. Until now, it was not possible to decipher the unknown sequences. Attempts to amplify the regions encoding specific enzymes did not reveal the nucleotide sequence [9]. An undetected protein covalent or other protein modification on the HBoV genome may explain this failure, as other parvoviruses (B19, MVM, and H1) possess protein covalents attached to their genomes [39, 51, 168]. Recent findings reveal that the majority (87.5%) of the ssDNA strands packed in the capsid are of negative polarity, independent from their viral subtypes [27]. The genomic composition is as yet unconfirmed, and so far three ORFs have been identified, similar to BPV and CnMV. One of these ORFs encodes for the viral capsid proteins VP1 and VP2, whereas the other two encode for non-structural proteins. The VP2 gene sequence is nested within the VP1 gene sequence. The VP1 sequence, compared to VP2, contains a unique terminal sequence, VP1u [163], which may be required for HBoV genome transfer to the nucleus for replication [236]. The HBoV capsid is composed of 60 proteins, derived from the structural molecule VP1 and its derivative VP2 [9]. The functions of the non-structural proteins NS1 and NP-1 are still equivocal. NS1 may play a role in replication. It generally acts as an initiator protein (for parvoviruses), specifically controlling the process by which several concatemeric intermediates are processed by rolling-hairpin replication [15]. The role for NP-1, located in the middle ORF, is still unclear, but probably also involves parvovirus replication. The transmission route of HBoV is still unknown, but suggested tissue sites for replication are the respiratory and intestinal epithelia, as well as the lymphatic organs. Parvoviruses replicate only in proliferating cells, and the viral proteins are transcribed only during the S-phase. Recently, an in vitro replication system for HBoV using stratified human airway epithelium to imitate the human trachea was successfully established. The cells were inoculated with HBoV-positive material from respiratory tract secretions of hospitalized children. Apical HBoV release from the cells was confirmed using PCR. This study further showed that the transcription model resembled that of both of the other known bocaviruses (BPV and MVC) [52].",

            "text": "Symptoms associated with possible HBoV infection are wheezing, fever, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia [8, 12, 19, 31, 33, 41, 43, 44, 49, 97, 114, 118\u2013121, 124, 126, 141, 176, 177, 179, 183, 195, 198, 203, 213, 219, 226, 235, 237, 239]. However, the presence of HBoV in the respiratory tract does not prove that the virus is the cause of infection. HBoV is often detected concomitantly with other respiratory viruses [41, 216, 226], a fact that adds to the uncertainty regarding the pathogenic potential for HBoV [41, 66, 91, 97, 118, 124, 128, 136, 176, 200, 203, 213, 217, 226, 239]. The symptoms are identical in patients positive for HBoV alone or combined with another virus, but the viral load is higher in mono-infections than in coinfections. Asymptomatic patients can carry the virus. In one study, 43% of tested asymptomatic children were HBoV-positive. These patients were admitted for elective surgery, and the group undergoing mainly ear, nose, and throat surgery had the highest prevalence of asymptomatic HBoV infection [124]. These data suggested that HBoV may persist in the host in the tonsillar lymphoid tissue, contributing to tonsillar hyperplasia [126]. HBoV has been detected in patients with symptoms of gastrointestinal infection, but it is unclear whether the virus is only excreted in stool or is a cause of gastroenteritis. In these studies, HBoV was found concomitantly with a norovirus or other enteric viruses, and HBoV was not directly proven to be a cause of gastrointestinal infection. The virus in suspension in respiratory secretions may be simply swallowed and excreted in stool. The newly discovered HBoV2 and HBoV3 have both been detected in stool samples. HBoV2 was identified in a study involving stool sample screening in children with non-polio acute flaccid paralysis [12, 100, 179], and HBoV2 and HBoV3 were detected in hospitalized children with acute gastroenteritis. More studies on the two new HBoV types are needed to gain a better understanding of their role in gastrointestinal infections. No evidence that HBoV2 and HBoV3 can infect gastrointestinal tissue exists to date. Furthermore, whether detection of these viruses in serum indicates viremia or infection of blood cells is unknown, because there are no currently established methods for detecting HBoV particles. The related parvovirus B19 can infect erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow, but no HBoV DNA was detected in bone marrow samples from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive and -negative individuals, whereas B19 was present in both groups [76, 146]. So far, there is one published report of HBoV associated with severe pneumonia in a pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient [172, 173] and one of HBoV infection in an adult with leukemia [109]. However, none of these patients had clinical symptoms different from those caused by other \u201ccommon cold\u201d pathogens, and no specific antiviral therapy was available.",

No seasonal variations have been described. HoBV occurs mainly in pediatric patients aged 6\u201324 months [4, 5, 9, 10, 12, 16, 17, 37, 40, 42, 44, 61, 74, 77, 86, 91, 95, 99, 103, 116, 127, 132, 143, 149, 158, 160, 162, 166, 167, 179, 187, 189, 194, 214, 219, 226, 235, 238]. Younger children may be protected by maternal antibodies [38]. HBoV-IgG can cross the placental barrier, but it is unclear whether HBoV can be transmitted from the mother to her fetus. Antibodies against HBoV have been found in about 94% of individuals older than 19 years of age [44]. At the moment, only two different genotypes of the single HBoV lineage are known. A simple verification test is available for rapidly differentiating between these two genotypes. Digestion of a 309-bp fragment of the VP1/VP2 gene with BstAPI endonuclease yields two fragments with genotype 1, but induces no cleavage with genotype 2 [54]. Three HBoV2 genotypes have been identified [5], but no information is available for HBoV3.",

In the early phase of the SARS near pandemic, the very first index patient fulfilling the subsequent WHO definition of SARS resided in Foshan near Guangzhou and was identified on November 16, 2002. One month later, the second case occurred, in Shenzhen, where a man who had regular contact with wild animals was infected and transmitted the disease to his family and to several staff members at the hospital where he was admitted. Similar cases were reported nearby. In January 2003, the second phase of the SARS outbreak started in Guangzhou.

Allander et al. in Sweden discovered a previously unrecognized third human polyomavirus in 6 (1%) of 637 nasopharyngeal aspirates and 1 (0.5%) of 192 fecal samples, and suggested the name KI polyomavirus (KIPyV) [7]. The second newly identified polyomavirus was found by Gaynor et al. in respiratory samples from Bribane, Australia, and St. Louis, MO, USA. This \u201cWashington University\u201d (WU) genome polyomavirus (WUPyV) was amplified and cloned from the nasopharyngeal aspirate of a 3-year-old patient with pneumonia and negative tests for other respiratory viruses. Screening of 2,135 patients with respiratory tract infections identified 43 additional cases [79]. Of note, KIPyV was not named for the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm where it was detected. Since the first description of KIPyV and WUPyV, a number of prevalence studies from various areas have been published, but the association of these viruses with acute respiratory tract infections remains unclear [2, 13, 117].",

The age distribution of KIPyV- and WUPyV-infected patients showed two peaks, in patients younger than 15 years (with the highest rates occurring before 5 years of age) and older than 45 years [3, 150]. Seasonal variations in KIPyV and WUPyV did not appear consistently. KIPyV infections predominated during the winter months in Thailand but not in Australia. In contrast, WUPyV infections were predominantly detected during late winter, peaking in December to early summer in Australia but not in Thailand [23, 24, 155].",

This oncogenic potential, as well as experience with other oncogenic viruses such as EBV, suggests a high likelihood of MCPyV generating clinical events in patients with hematological malignancies.

The role for this virus in patients with hematological malignancies is unclear. The number of known parechoviruses is growing rapidly, as novel identification methods have led to the discovery of new variants. Parechoviruses were classified in the Enterovirus genus initially, then found to exhibit different biological features, leading to their reclassification in their own genus. Clinically, they cause the same spectrum of disease as enteroviruses. The rodent parechovirus known as Ljungan virus is believed to be associated with greater disease severity [1, 6, 20\u201322, 55, 68, 90, 96, 107, 151, 170, 199, 209, 212, 223, 230, 231, 234, 240, 241].

Nevertheless, perhaps due to concern that a lethal variant similar to the Spanish flu may return, or due to the awarding of research grants based on this fear, any \u201cnovel\u201d influenza virus variant is estimated to have pandemic potential and is therefore classified as an emerging pathogen (and as an opportunity for the media to generate widespread fear of general social disorganization and massive mortality). The most recent virus classified as an emerging influenza virus was the Mexican H1N1 strain identified in 2009.",

The predominant involvement of younger individuals suggests a role for unknown factors that contribute to clinical disease. Alternatively, aging might exert a protective effect.

The clinical spectrum ranges from mild to severe respiratory diseases to epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (\u201cpink eye\u201d), tonsillopharyngitis, and gastroenteric disorders (vomiting, diarrhea). Adenoviruses occur in over 50 serotypes, affecting all age groups and causing diseases that are usually self-limiting within 14 days or asymptomatic [46, 62, 71, 92, 130, 131, 135]. Importantly, adenoviruses may persist in the infected host [46, 62, 71, 92, 130, 131, 135] and may undergo reactivation in immunosuppressed patients, including those with hematological malignancies. Adenoviruses play a major role in solid-organ transplant recipients but occur less often in stem cell recipients [46, 62, 71, 92, 130, 131, 135], However, novel and more aggressive adenovirus strains may meet the definition for emerging pathogens and may play a future role in patients with hematological malignancies. Consequently, adenoviruses deserve attention. More specifically, shedding may be prolonged in high-risk patients, patient isolation may be required, and no antiviral therapy for adenoviruses is available so far [46, 62, 71, 92, 130, 131, 135].",
