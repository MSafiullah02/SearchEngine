            "text": "Influenza is a highly contagious respiratory illness that can be debilitating or cause complications leading to hospitalization and death. The disease's etiological agents, influenza viruses (orthomyxoviruses), are single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses (Palese and Shaw, 2007). Of the 3 types (influenza A, B, and C), only A and B cause epidemic human disease. In addition, influenza A virus (IAV) is the precursor of all pandemic viruses and will be the focus of this review. The genome of IAV consists of 8 separate segments, encoding 10\u201311 proteins covered by the nucleocapsid protein (NP) (McGeoch et al., 1976). Virions are enveloped with two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), which are responsible for binding of the virus to host cell receptors and release of progeny virions from host cells, respectively, and are the target of host antibody response. The active RNA-dependent RNA polymerase responsible for replication and transcription consists of three polymerase proteins (PB1, PB2, and PA), which together with each viral genome segment and NP form the eight viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes in each virion (Compans et al., 1974). Matrix protein 1 (M1) is a structural protein encasing the viral genome just beneath the envelope, and matrix protein 2 (M2) acts as an ion channel pump that permits ions to enter the virion and undergo uncoating in the endosome (Fujiyoshi et al., 1994, Pinto and Lamb, 2006). The NS gene encodes NS1, which has multiple functions including obstruction of the host antiviral response (Garcia-Sastre, 2006, Krug et al., 2003), and NS2, also known as nuclear export protein, which is important for nuclear export of viral ribonucleic acids (RNAs) (Inglis et al., 1979). By virtue of possessing a segmented genome, influenza virus can easily reassort by rearranging viral segments of two different influenza viruses infecting the same cell and thereby acquire radically different antigenic properties to produce a novel subtype, a phenomenon termed antigenic shift (Cox and Subbarao, 2000, Parrish and Kawaoka, 2005). Antigenic shift may also occur when an animal or avian IAV is transmitted without reassortment directly from an animal reservoir to humans. A pandemic can occur when a new IAV subtype emerges from the reassortment process with the ability to cause disease and spread efficiently in large geographic areas (more than one continent) among humans who have little or no immunity. An example is the current 2009 pandemic swine-origin H1N1 influenza A virus (Novel Swine-Origin Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Investigation Team, 2009, Smith et al., 2009, Zarocostas, 2009), which is slightly more pathogenic than seasonal influenza viruses but much less so than the 1918 pandemic or H5N1 avian IAV in ferret and/or mouse models (Maines et al., 2009, Munster et al., 2009).",

The virus is taken up into the cell by endocytosis. Acidification of the endocytic vesicle results in a conformational change of HA, leading to fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane and liberation of vRNPs into the cytoplasm of the host cell (Pinto et al., 1992). The vRNPs are transported to the nucleus for transcription of viral mRNAs and replication of genomic RNA in a complex process, which is delicately regulated by viral and host cellular factors (Boulo et al., 2007, Nagata et al., 2008). Upon translation of viral proteins and assembly of nucleocapsids harboring replicated genomic RNA, progeny virions bud from the cellular membrane, aided by the activity of the NA (Fig. 1\n).",

IAVs can infect people and many other animal species, but wild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for all known subtypes of IAVs. Avian IAV strains are further classified as low pathogenic or highly pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI or HPAI, respectively) on the basis of their intravenous pathogenicity criteria (Swayne and Pantin-Jackwood, 2006, World Animal Health Organization, 2008). HPAI viruses mostly occur among avian H5 and H7 subtypes. In recent years, rare infections among humans with HPAI H5N1 viruses in areas experiencing H5N1 epizootics have resulted in over 60% mortality in humans (EPR, 2009, Uyeki, 2008). H5N1 is considered a significant pandemic threat because human populations lack immunity to it and ongoing genetic variation may allow it to acquire capacity for human-to-human transmission. Avian H7 and H9 subtypes, which have also infected humans, are also considered potential pandemic threats (Werner and Harder, 2006).",

            "text": "The IAV is notorious for its unique ability to cause both recurrent epidemics and global pandemics. Annually, the global burden of influenza epidemics is believed to be 3\u20135 million cases of severe illness and 300,000\u2013500,000 deaths. In the United States alone, an annual average of approximately 36,000 deaths was estimated for the 1991 through 1999 influenza seasons (Thompson et al., 2003). In the 20th\u201321st centuries, pandemics occurred in 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009. The 1918 pandemic was the most severe, with half of the world population infected, of which 20% developed severe disease; estimates of the number of deaths range from 20 to 100 million (Johnson and Mueller, 2002, Oxford, 2000). Fatality after influenza is often caused by secondary bacterial pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (Grose and Chokephaibulkit, 2004, Muir and Wilson, 1919), as a consequence of highly efficient viral replication, preferred tropism, and a dysfunctional host inflammatory response (Maines et al., 2008). The risk of serious illness and death from influenza is highest in persons aged 65 years or older and in patients with medical conditions that place them at increased risk of developing complications. Recently, a substantial impact of influenza has been recognized in pediatric populations, especially among children who are co-infected with IAV and bacteria; even children who appear to be healthy, infection can progress rapidly to severe illness (Bhat et al., 2005).",

Although characteristics of the host such as age, comorbidity, degree of pre-existing immunity, immunosuppression, pregnancy, and smoking are recognized to influence the acquisition, progression, and resolution of influenza infections, host genetic factors remain a possibility (Nicholson et al., 2003). It has been suggested that individual genetic variation may lead to differential response of the host to IAV infection (Albright et al., 2008).

We carried out a thorough literature review using PubMed and the Human Genome Epidemiology Network Published Literature database (www.hugenavigator.net) (Yu et al., 2008) but could not identify any published epidemiologic or family studies that examined individual genetic variability in relation to susceptibility to IAV disease and its outcomes. In the past decade, a great deal of understanding of the pathogenesis and immune evasion strategies of influenza virus has developed; this could help us propose candidate genes that may be responsible for severe illness. Recently, genome-wide association (GWA) studies have had considerable success in identifying candidate genes for several common, complex diseases; this exploratory and hypothesis-free approach has been applied only twice to the study of infectious disease (Fellay et al., 2007, Jallow et al., 2009). With the annual threat of seasonal influenza and the potential emergence of a novel IAV pandemic strain with an unknown level of virulence, we need to understand genetic variation in the human population and its association with severe outcomes from IAV infection. These efforts will be crucial to the development of tools for targeting interventions in populations (Fauci, 2006).",

            "text": "To identify potential genes for future targeted research, we take a systems-based approach to propose candidate genes that could influence the response of the host to influenza infection based on animal studies, such as global transcriptional profiles and knockout mice, clinical data, or simply biological plausibility. We propose candidate genes whose proteins are implicated in one or more stages in the viral replication cycle and induction of host innate responses, and thus in pathogenesis: binding of the virus to receptors on the host cell surface; cleavability of HA by host proteases; virus replication in host cells; destruction of host cells by apoptosis; state of immunocompetence of the individual host; and viral infections predisposing to bacterial infection. A systems-based approach can provide more complete coverage of candidate genes within a suspected etiologic system, for example, in aberrant host innate immune and cell death responses, which have been suggested by global transcriptional profiling of the host response to IAV infection in mice (Ding et al., 2008, Kash et al., 2006b, Rosseau et al., 2007, Seki et al., 2009), ferrets (Cameron et al., 2008), and macaques (Kobasa et al., 2007). By broadening our proposed candidate genes to include multiple genes in an interconnected system, rather than simply focusing on a single putatively interesting gene, we hope to provide a more complete picture of the impact of the entire system or pathway as we discuss below. We suggest that a systems-based approach to the study of susceptibility to IAV is reasonable, despite the popularity of hypothesis-free GWA studies, which have uncovered \u201cnew\u201d candidate genes for a variety of common human diseases; such studies need very large sample sizes and their findings require further replication (Manolio et al., 2008). A systems-based approach takes advantage of understanding the phenotype and biological pathways relating genes to disease; this approach has identified several genes that confer susceptibility to common infectious diseases, e.g. HIV infection (O\u2019Brien and Nelson, 2004, Tabor et al., 2002). A systems-based approach can be successful only if we apply rigorous epidemiological principles to the choice and analysis of candidate genes in the disease studied. A detailed rationale for the selection of each candidate gene we reviewed is listed in Supplementary Table.",

            "text": "The first key step in infection, transmission, and virulence of IVAs is the binding of HA to the host receptor, SA-terminated glycan, on the surface of host cells. The presence, type, and location of the receptor determine both host susceptibility to infection with specific viruses and location of infection. Human IAVs preferentially bind SA in \u03b1-2,6 linkage with galactose (Gal), a major glycan of human upper airways; avian IAVs (e.g., H5N1) preferentially recognize a receptor with SA\u03b1-2,3Gal linkage, which is common in birds, but is also found in the epithelium of the human lower respiratory tract (Shinya et al., 2006, van Riel et al., 2006) and less commonly in the upper respiratory tract (Nicholls et al., 2007). Recent evidence suggests that the avian H5N1 virus can infect human nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal epithelia in ex vivo cultures despite of the paucity of SA\u03b1-2,3Gal receptors; this finding suggests other binding sites on the epithelium may exist, although the identity of the specific receptors is not yet known (Nicholls et al., 2007, Nicholls et al., 2008). A switch in recognition from avian-like SA\u03b1-2,3Gal to human-like SA\u03b1-2,6Gal is believed to be one of the changes that must occur before avian IAVs can transmit efficiently among humans and acquire the potential to cause a pandemic (Russell et al., 2006, Stevens et al., 2006, van Riel et al., 2007). This adaption correlates with point mutations changing certain amino acids in viral HA (Vines et al., 1998, Yamada et al., 2006). Genes that control the expression and specificity of oligosaccharide structures on human tissues may contribute to the host's susceptibility and/or to the extent of influenza infection in the upper or lower airways. The host enzyme ST3 beta-galactosamide alpha-2,3-sialyltranferase 1 (ST3GAL1) produces the SA\u03b1-2,3Gal structure (Kitagawa and Paulson, 1994), while the SA\u03b1-2,6Gal linkage is primarily generated by ST6 beta-galactoside alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase 1(ST6GAL1) (Gagneux et al., 2003, Martin et al., 2002, Weinstein et al., 1987). It has been shown that MDCK cells over-expressing human ST6GAL1 have significantly augmented susceptibility to human influenza viruses and produce more viruses when compared with unmodified cells (Matrosovich et al., 2003, Oh et al., 2008).",

            "text": "HA-mediated fusion between the host endosomal membrane and the viral envelope requires the cleavage of HA precursor molecule HA0 into HA1 and HA2 subunits by host proteases. Cleavage of HA is indispensable for infectivity and determines viral pathogenicity and tissue tropism (Steinhauer, 1999). The HA0 of human and LPAI has a consensus cleavage site motif and is cleaved by a typsin-like protease; infection is localized to the primary site of infection, such as the respiratory tract in humans or the gastrointestinal tract of aquatic birds, respectively. Some secreted enzymes isolated from rat and swine lungs are shown to support replication of influenza viruses in vitro using mouse-adapted IAV (e.g., WSN strain), including tryptase Clara, mini-plasmin, and ectopic anionic trypsin from rat lungs, and tryptase TC30 from porcine lungs (Kido et al., 2008); however, only a few proteases are present in the human respiratory tract or tissue fluids, including transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), 11D (TMPRSS11D) (Bottcher et al., 2006), 4 (TMPRSS4) (Chaipan et al., 2009), and plasmin (PLG). These transmembrane serine proteases are identified by gene expression systems in MDCK cells; TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 are considered good candidate proteases for the 1918 influenza virus HA (Chaipan et al., 2009). Plasmin is converted from plasminogen into the circulation. WSN NA can sequester plasminogen, leading to increased HA cleavage by plasmin in vitro (Goto et al., 2001). Conversely, the HA0 of HPAI viruses contains genetic insertions at the cleavage site of HA and is cleaved by subtilisin-like proteases Furin (FURIN) (Walker et al., 1994), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 5 (PCSK5) (Horimoto et al., 1994), and recently identified TMPRSS13 (Kido et al., 2008). Cleavage by these more ubiquitous proteases allows the HPAI viruses to infect various cell types and cause systemic infection. In addition to host cellular proteases, microbial proteases also activate viral HA, which may play a role in synergism of co-infection by IAV and bacteria, as discussed later (Tashiro et al., 1987). Host protease activities can be suppressed by protease inhibitors such as human mucus secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor (SLPI) in the upper respiratory tract and SFTPA1 and SFTPD in the lower respiratory tract, which inhibit the interaction between the proteases and viral HA and NA (Kido et al., 2007)",

At low pH within endosome, the viral HA undergoes a conformational change that enables fusion of the viral and host endosomal membranes, allowing for the release of vRNPs into the cytoplasm (Pinto et al., 1992). The acidification of endosomes is regulated by host cellular vacuolar H+ ATPases (Guinea and Carrasco, 1995). After transport of the viral genome into the nucleus, viral transcription is performed by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to produce mRNAs that are exported from the nucleus and translated into viral proteins in the cytoplasm. Trafficking of viral genomic RNA into and out of the nucleus through the nuclear membrane is through interactions with host cell nuclear import and export machinery, including importin alpha and beta, exportin 1, and RAN (Boulo et al., 2007).",

            "text": "For replication and transcription of the influenza virus genome, not only viral factors but also host-derived cellular factors are required. Key among the functional interactions during influenza virus infection is the dependence of the virus on cellular RNA synthesis by DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II (Pol II), as the viral mRNA transcription is initiated by use of short 5\u2032 capped RNA fragments, derived from host cellular Pol II transcripts, as primers (Engelhardt and Fodor, 2006). The virus can alter the distribution of Pol II on cellular genes, leading to a reduction in Pol II elongation, thereby contributing to the well-known phenomenon of host cell shutoff, in which there is a dramatic decrease in the translation of cellular mRNAs while viral transcripts remain efficiently and selectively translated during influenza virus infection (Chan et al., 2006, Engelhardt et al., 2005). Recent functional assays and proteomics have suggested a panel of host cellular proteins may interact with the viral polymerase and vRNP complexes (for review, see Mayer et al., 2007, Nagata et al., 2008). Viral NS1 is also a major player in shutting down host protein synthesis by interacting with host proteins to interfere with the host machinery, such as CPSF4 (cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 4, 30kDa) (Noah et al., 2003) and PABN1 (poly(A) binding protein, nuclear 1) (Chen et al., 1999) in polyadenylation; IVNS1ABP (influenza virus NS1A binding protein) (Wolff et al., 1998) in splicing; and BAT1(HLA-B associated transcript 1) (Momose et al., 2001) in nucleocytoplasmic transport of cellular mRNAs. NS1 also recruits the cellular initiation factor, EIF4G1 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma, 1), allowing for the preferential translation of the IAV messengers (Aragon et al., 2000). Viral M1 can interact with VPS28 (vacuolar protein-sorting 28 homolog), a component of endosomal complexes required for transport, and CDC42 (cell division cycle 42), a small G protein, playing an important role in budding of the IAV (Hui et al., 2006). A variety of intracellular signaling pathways activated by IAV infection, such as the Raf/MEK/ERK mitogenic kinase cascade, are in part exploited by the virus to ensure efficient replication (Ludwig, 2007). Specific blockade of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway results in nuclear retention of viral RNPs complexes in late stages of the replication cycle, which significantly impairs growth of IAVs tested in cell culture and Raf-BxB transgenic mice (Olschlager et al., 2004, Pleschka et al., 2001). A number of host proteins, including lipids, microfilaments, G proteins, and some protein kinases, have been shown to be involved in the budding of influenza virus (for a review, see Nayak et al., 2004). For example, casein kinase 2 (CK2) is found in influenza virus particles; increased CK2 activity correlates with the replication cycle of influenza virus and its inhibitors disrupt virus budding in MDCK cells (Hui and Nayak, 2002, Tucker et al., 1991).",

The precise mechanism of virus-induced apoptosis is unclear. Many pathways can be activated, and the initiation of one pathway can induce multiple signal transduction cascades through feedback loops. Such pathways, at the least, include those mediated by Fas (TNF receptor superfamily, member 6), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase 2 (EIF2AK2, also known as PKR), or transforming growth factor, beta 1 (TGFB1) (Brydon et al., 2005). PKR is a key regulator in influenza virus-induced apoptosis. Activation of PKR by IAV dsRNA leads to several sequential downstream events, including the activation of EIF2A, BAX, BCL2, and NFKB1. The latter leads to transcriptional induction of many pro-apoptotic genes, including those encoding Fas, TP53, and JUN. PKR can initiate CASP8, a predominant apoptotic pathway in human bronchiolar cells during IAV infection, leading to a caspase cascade (Zhirnov et al., 2002).",

Both single-strand (ss) and dsRNA, viral RNA products generated during infection, act like triggers for the production of type I IFN, IFNA1 and IFNB1, which are recognized by two types of sensors, the transmembrane Toll-like receptors (TLR3, -7, and -8) and cytoplasmic RIG-I-like receptors (RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2) (Garcia-Sastre and Biron, 2006). The Toll-like receptors signal via their adaptors either TRIF in the case of TLR3 or MyD88 in the case of TLR7 and -8 (Diebold et al., 2004, Guillot et al., 2005). The RIG-I-like receptors signal via mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MASP), also known as IPS-1 (Yoneyama and Fujita, 2007). These interactions initiate signaling pathways that differ in their initial steps but converge in the activation of IRF3 and NFKB1, which induce transcription of IFNB1 and IFNB2. Mice lacking both Myd88 and Masp genes fail to up-regulate antiviral responses; Tlr7- and Myd88-deficient mice have no protection against IAV vaccination challenges (Koyama et al., 2007). Tlr3 knockout mice show significantly reduced inflammatory mediators and better survival rates compared with wild-type mice after IAV infection, despite of a higher viral load in the lungs (Le Goffic et al., 2006). A loss-of-function mutant in TLR3 (F303S) was identified in a patient with influenza-associated encephalopathy (Hidaka et al., 2006).",

This binding, followed by activation of the Janus kinase (JAK) family and subsequent activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins (Murray, 2007), results in the induction of a cellular antiviral response involving the transcriptional upregulation of more than 100 IFN-stimulated genes (such as CXCL10, MX1, PKR, OAS1, RNASEL, and PML), through several signaling pathways, including NFKB1, JUN, and MX1 (Garcia-Sastre and Biron, 2006). IFN also stimulates the production of a form of inducible NOS2A and the MHC class I and II proteins, all of which play important roles in the immune response to infections. The IFNG-induced genes are vigorously expressed in H5N1-infected ferret lungs, in particular, CXCL10, for which blockade of its cognate receptor, CXCR3, reduces the mortality associated with H5N1 infection in ferrets (Cameron et al., 2008).

This prevents viral replication and inhibits normal cell ribosome function, killing both the virus and the host cell if the response is active for a sufficient time. To evade the antiviral effects of PKR, IAV has evolved 2 strategies to block PKR activation or action: the virus activates a host cellular inhibitor of PKR, p58IPK, and its NS1 protein blocks PKR activation (Kash et al., 2006a). IAV NS1 protein has been identified as a potent agonist of the innate antiviral signaling, both by interference with the RIG-I induction of IFNB (Guo et al., 2007, Mibayashi et al., 2007), and at a later stage, by modulating processing of pre-mRNA (Krug et al., 2003). A recent in vitro study has shown that IAVs not only suppress IFNB gene production but also inhibit type I IFN signaling via a NFKB1-dependent induction of the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) protein, a potent endogenous blocker of JAK/STAT signaling, which results in an impaired antiviral response (Pauli et al., 2008). Evidence from animal studies suggests that evasion of host innate immunity, including the type I interferon response, is a mechanism of virulence of avian H5N1 viruses in mammals including humans (Maines et al., 2008).",

Cytokines, components of the innate immune response, also affect the adaptive immune response and manifestation of the disease (Kaufmann et al., 2001). Cytokines can signal immune cells, including T-cells and macrophages, to travel to the site of infection. In addition, cytokines activate those cells, stimulating them to produce more cytokines. Normally this positive feedback loop is kept in check by negative regulatory elements, including other specific cytokines. In some instances, however, an uncontrolled or excessive immune response to the IAV results in an outpouring of numerous chemokines and cytokines (Osterholm, 2005). Both pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, IL1B, and IL6, and anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL10 and IL1RN, are elevated in the serum. The fierce and often lethal interplay of these cytokines leading to the acute respiratory distress syndrome is referred to as a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d, which has been suggested as an explanation, in addition to highly efficient viral replication, for the devastating nature of the 1918 pandemic flu, particularly in younger adults. Evidence for this hypothesis comes from 1918-virus-infected mouse (Kash et al., 2006b) and 1918-virus-infected macaque (Kobasa et al., 2007) models and may help explain the high rate of severe and fatal disease outcomes in humans infected with highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza viruses (de Jong et al., 2006).",

            "text": "The adaptive immune response requires some days to be effective in a na\u00efve but not a primed or immune individual, then works to contain the viral spread, to eradicate the virus, and finally to establish a memory response resulting in a long-lived resistance to reinfection with homologous infection. Mucosal or systematically produced antibodies to viral HA are the primary mediators of virus neutralization and the main objectives of immunization with vaccine. Like antibodies to NA, anti-HA antibodies can also reduce viral load by non-neutralizing mechanisms, which include lysis of the infected cell via a complement system or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Antibodies to the M1 and NP proteins are made following influenza infection but they play an unknown role in immunity against influenza. Although antibodies to M2 can protect from severe disease and reduce viral load in experimental animal studies, evidence for a similar role in humans is lacking. Antigen presentation via MHC class I and II molecules by dendritic cells lead to activation, proliferation, and differentiation of the antigen-specific T-cells, CD4+ and CD8+. The influenza-specific CD4+ T helper cells are primarily responsible for promoting a high-quality antibody response. The CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) have the ability to recognize specific viral epitopes encoded by multiple viral genes on MHC class I molecules, but depending on an individual's HLA haplotype. CD8+ T cells recognizing only one or a few viral epitopes will dominate the response, producing antiviral cytokines and lysing target cells that present viral determinants for which they bear a specific T-cell receptor. CD8+ and CD4+ effector T cells (Teff cells) can control lung inflammation during acute influenza virus infection by producing Il10 in mice. Blocking the action of the Teff cell-derived Il10 results in increased pulmonary inflammation and lethal injury (Sun et al., 2009). CD8+ CTLs clear IVA-infected epithelial cells mainly by CD69-mediated cytotoxicity or exocytosis granules containing perforin 1 and granzymes, such as granzyme B (Topham et al., 1997). Natural killer (NK) cells have lectin-like \u2018nonspecific\u2019 receptors for virus-infected cells (Biassoni et al., 2001). The IAV HA protein can interact with two lysis receptors, NCR1 and NCR2 (Arnon et al., 2001, Mandelboim et al., 2001). Increased binding to influenza virus-infected cells is also observed in 2 inhibitory receptors, KIR2DL1 and LILRBI (Achdout et al., 2003). NK cells can recognize antibody-coated virally infected cells through their Fc\u03b3 receptors, FCGR3A and FCGR3B, and kill the targets by ADCC (Hashimoto et al., 1983). Various Fc\u03b3 receptors, including Fcgr1a, Fcgr2b, Fcgr1 g, Fcgr3a, and Fcgr3b, are over-expressed in murine lungs after infection with IAV (Rosseau et al., 2007). The list of host genes involved in the adaptive immune response is extensive (Doherty et al., 2006) and is beyond the scope of this review.",

            "text": "Several factors may explain the lethal synergism between influenza virus and bacteria (McCullers, 2006). Destruction of respiratory epithelium by the virus can promote bacterial adhesion. In addition, several bacteria secrete proteases that activate infectivity of IAV by proteolytic cleavage of the viral HA (Tashiro et al., 1987). Inflammatory response to viral infection may up-regulate expression of molecules such as PTAFR (platelet-activating factor receptor) that bacteria can use as receptors, as suggested by studies in mice (McCullers and Rehg, 2002) and Ptafr-knockout mice (van der Sluijs et al., 2006). Recently, a DNA microarray analysis has demonstrated that 15 platelet activating factor-related molecules were specifically induced in the murine lungs co-infected by IAV and Streptococus pneumoniae (Seki et al., 2009). The virus infection can cause bacterial superinfections by impairing the ability of the host to mount a productive immune response against subsequent bacterial infection. Host immunopathology may be increased through the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines, cytokine storm, and apoptosis (Kash et al., 2006b). Rosseau and colleagues have reported inflammatory transcriptional signatures of 1300 genes from murine lungs after infection with either IAV or Streptococus pneumoniae. Of these, approximately 36% were specific for pneumococcus and 30% were specific for the virus; a differential response was observed on the cytokine and chemokine level, although common induction of type I and type II interferon, Tnf, and Il6 underlies both infections (Rosseau et al., 2007). OX40-immunogolubulin, an effective immunosuppressive agent that targets the co-stimulatory molecule TNFRSF4, formerly OX40, allows sufficient activation of the host immune response to clear an IAV infection, but it suppresses the response enough to prevent severe immunopathology in lungs of infected mice (Humphreys et al., 2003).",

Recent developments in large-scale complete-genome sequencing, antigenic mapping, and epidemiological modeling promise to provide a more comprehensive picture of the evolution of influenza viruses and of their pattern of transmission through human and animal populations (Nelson and Holmes, 2007). Completion of the human genome project, validation of millions of human genetic variants in HapMap (International HapMap Consortium, 2005) and rapid advances in genotyping technologies create a great opportunity to advance human genomic studies of influenza infection in areas such as susceptibility and disease severity. By leveraging biological knowledge to propose an extended selection of candidate genes across different systems or pathways in the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection, we hope to provide a more complete picture of the impact of the entire system, for which the list of candidate genes should not be limited only to those highlighted here. Studies of candidate genes in human host response to IAV infection are an important starting point for understanding the constantly evolving interaction between virus and host, for identifying prognostic indicators, and for developing tools for targeting interventions in populations and novel antiviral therapies (Fauci, 2006). Establishing a DNA bank from patients with influenza infection for study of genetic variation in the human population and its association with the pathogenicity of influenza, its transmissibility, and the effectiveness of vaccines (and their side effects) will be a first step in this process.",

During entry into a cell, the IVA particle binds to the host cell receptor SA through its HA. The virus is taken up by the cell by endocytosis. Acidification of the endocytic vesicle results in a conformational change of HA, leading to fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane and liberation of RNPs into the cytoplasm. The RNPs are transported to the nucleus for transcription of viral mRNAs and replication of genomic RNA in a complex process which is delicately regulated by viral and host cellular factors. Upon translation of viral proteins and assembly of nucleocapsids harboring replicated genomic RNA, progeny virions bud from the cellular membrane by the NA activity.
