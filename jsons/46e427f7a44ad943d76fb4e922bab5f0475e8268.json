In this setting, the virus' basic reproductive number R0, which characterizes the average number of secondary cases generated by each primary case, takes on a significant importance in the quantification of the potential scope of the pandemic. Yet, in most models, R0 is assumed to be a universal constant for the virus across outbreak clusters and populations -thus neglecting the inherent variability of the transmission process due to varying population densities, demographics, temporal factors, etc. In fact, it can be shown that the reproduction number is highly variable. Considering its expected value thus leads to biased or loose results in the reported predictive scenarios, especially as these are tailored to a given country or region. The goal of this paper is the examination of the impact of the reproductive number R's variability on important output metrics, and the percolation of this variability in projected scenarios so as to provide uncertainty quantification.",

R 0 thus serves as an epidemiological metric to describe the contagiousness or transmissibility of infectious agents: the outbreak is expected to continue if R 0 is greater than 1, or to naturally subside if R 0 is strictly less than 1. As recently highlighted by Delameter et al. [4] , this coefficient inherently depends on some local characteristics of the population. In particular, going back to the decomposition provided in Eq. 1, R 0 is intrinsically tied to temporal and spatially-varying factors, such as population age demographics, political or environmental variables, cultural or social dynamics, or the density of the population -all favoring or diminishing the rate of contactsc between individuals. R 0 can thus be naturally modeled using a hierarchical framework, which accounts for the reproductive number's heterogeneity by decomposing it according to different strata. For instance, the reproductive number R could be hierarchically broken down according to countries (or regions), age groups, and, at the most granular level, across subjects. The expected number of secondary cases is indeed contingent on each primary cases' socio-economic status, age, etc., and perhaps even time -as one could imagine the contact rates varying between weekends and weekdays. A very fine-grain analysis of the R 0 's heterogeneity would thus model R 0 as a distribution over cases and time in a given population. Figure 1 shows one such potential hierarchical stratification. The \"universal\" R 0 used in epidemiological models to characterize the disease might thus be thought of as a general summary statistic, averaged over individuals and populations -thus discarding any form of local variability. The underlying assumption is that the dynamics of the pandemic are similarly described by the trajectory estimated using the average R 0 , or the average of the epidemic's trajectories with varying R 0 . Yet, because the number of new incident cases each day depends exponentially on the history of the trajectory, this averaging approximation might come at a huge accuracy cost in prediction models. To give a clearer picture of the potential effects of this additional randomness on the model, let us consider two naive experiments.",

Consider for instance the stopping time corresponding to the total number of deaths reaching 5,000: \u03c4 = min{t \u2208 N : D t \u2265 5, 000}. Since the model is build sequentially, it is difficult to get close form formulas and exact probabilistic results. We thus resort to simulating 40,000 contagion events over 100 days to quantify the impact of this added variability. In one case, we simulate the propagation of the epidemic using a fixed, constant R 0 . In the other, we simulate the propagation assuming that at each time step, R is sampled from a gamma distribution centered around R 0 . We compare the effect of the two models on the evolution of the number of deaths and the stopping time \u03c4 . The results are reported in Figure 2 .",

This is in fact mimicking a scenario under which R varies every day, thus accounting for some temporal effects (weekend vs week days), subject-effects across newly infected cases, etc. Let us now try to recover the R 0 using the Exponential Growth model in the R0 R-package.

The latter builds upon the spatial random effects model, but adds a further layer of variability by assuming a random daily effect. In other words, whereas in the \"spatial random-effects\" approach, the R is assumed to vary across groups but is held constant throughout the trajectory, in the \"full random-effects\" model, R varies at each time step. This assumes that the inherent daily variations of the reproductive number Rs are too substantial to be neglected. In both cases, a more granular estimation of the R 0 using geographical, weekday, weather, and other sources of information could make day-to-day variations in the R 0 provide more realistic epidemiological predictions of the outbreak propagation speed, as well as the expected times before hospitals reach capacity -both crucial quantities for informing policy makers as they arbitrate between different courses of action, especially as drastic public health measures typically come at significant social and economical costs. We emphasize that our goal here is not to come up with a new model or definition for the R 0 , nor to pretend to a better predictive model than experts in epidemiology. Rather, our focus is simply to assess -as statisticians -the effect of this added variability in predictive scenarios, in order to grasp a little better how this variability is propagated in downstream analyses. One of the hypotheses that we would thus like to test is if the heterogeneity of the R 0 coefficient can severely impact predictive scenarios for the outbreaks: how certain are we about the predictions that we are making? In light of the observed heterogeneity of the R 0 's, how confident are we of the transferability of a given policy in one country to another?",

Our model is based on the non-parametric model by Fraser [6] , also used for estimating R 0 in Cori et al [2] . A version of this model was implemented in the R-package EarlyR [11] , which has been used in recent studies [13] to infer COVID 19's R 0 . Instead of explicitly modeling the exposed and infected periods separately -based solely on the number of new infections-this model foregoes the modeling of latent cases and relies solely on inferring the number of new cases from previous observations using an \"infectivity profile\" [2] . In this setting, each infected case is expected to contaminate on average of R 0 patients (by definition) -but the distribution of this number of new infections is given by a probability distribution which only depends on the time s elapsed since infection: one could indeed imagine a patient becoming increasingly contagious over the first few days of the infection as the viral load builds up, and decreasingly so after the peak of the illness. This infectious profile is typically modeled as a Gamma distribution. Since this quantity is generally unknown and hard to estimate from available data, Cori et al [2] propose the use of the parameters of the serial interval (for which we typically have much more substantial observational data and means of estimation) as a good proxy. The only drawback of this model compared to the SEIR compartmental one is that the exponential growth phase is only valid for the first stages of the epidemic (on shorter timelines), and will thus not yield informative scenarios in longer time horizons (several years) -but it does provide a valid estimate of R 0 that we can then plug in as parameter in any deterministic model. Our goal is to assess the toll of hospital load that a rapidly propagating pandemic can induce. As such, we emphasize that we focus on short-term estimation, and the study of the uncertainty for time frames of a few weeks, rather than months -since it could also be argued that due to the dynamic nature of the problem and rapidly changing policies, scenarios for months or years ahead are extremely hard to devise.",

We propose to assume here the transmissibility to be common across all groups, and the rate of contactc g to be group-specific, as it is intrinsically tied to locally varying parameters (age demographics, social and cultural habits and current local policies), etc. This decomposition also provides a convenient way to model the effect of the measures deployed by governments to try to control the spread, which effectively targets diminishing the reproductive number R by reducing the daily contact ratec.

Intuitively, this assumes that any infected person in population 1 to be in average in contact with one susceptible person per day. All other values ofc can thus be understood as relative measures with respect to this benchmark group -thus ac 2 with value 2 would indicate that, on a daily basis, an infected individual in population 2 has twice as many contacts in the susceptible group than in population 1. This benchmark value could be either an arbitrary benchmark value (which should allow the potential R to vary within reasonable ranges), or an informed measure of social interactions -for instance, a daily contact of one person per day might seem like an appropriate value for a population in complete lockdown, such as seen in Wuhan as of January 22 nd .",

This group is taken to be our reference group (we assume that in this case, the number of daily contacts is 1). The plots shown in Figure 6 show the time series for a few of our selected epidemic groups, and highlight the need to make our analysis more robust. Indeed, the exact date of the onset of the epidemic in each group is uncertain, as is shown on those plots by the fact that the different countries are currently at different stages of the epidemic. In particular, we note the substantial lag of the United States with respect to Europe -though the sudden spike in number of reported cases seems to indicate an under-reporting of previous cases, potentially due to lack of testing. To account for this under-reporting of the number of early cases, we introduce a random variable \u00b5 (g) 0 modeling these phantom, unreported cases. We also observe the existence of what seems to be (a) different times of onset of the epidemic across the various groups and (b) erroneous reporting-as the increments in the number of deaths are sometimes negative. We correct the latter by thresholding the increments at 0 -that is, we assume that these negative increments are due to an error in the reporting. For the first, we propose a slight adaptation of the Poisson Model proposed in the previous subsection.",

As for the synthetic experiments, we fit the model in Eq. 5 using Rstan [1] , 8 chains with 5,000 warmup iterations and 1,000 sampling steps. Figures 8   and 9 show the posterior credible intervals for the daily contact rates, transmissibility, as well as each group's spatial reproductive number R g itself. As a first sanity check to the performance of the model, we compare the values of the recovered R for Hubei 0 and 1 -two different stages of the epidemic in Hubei, with a tightening of the lockdown. It is interesting and reassuring to see in Figure   8 that the reproductive number for Hubei does seem to have gone down, from a value of roughly 0.91 in the first days of the quarantine to 0.82 over the past 36 days -whether this decrease is due to the even tighter lockdown, or the decrease in the susceptible population, the order between these two coefficients is in the order we'd expect . Moreover, these values recovered by our model are consistent with both numbers that have been found in other studies [13, 12] , as well as aligned with the R 0 recovered by using the earlyR [11] programming suite (see (see Fig.11b , 11f,12d) -yielding in most cases similar predictions, as shown by the overlapping green (Bayesian) and pink (earlyR) confidence intervals. This serves as a benchmark test to our model: the Bayesian model that we use here is consistent with other statistical methods for estimating the R 0 . Again, our purpose here is not to \"beat\" established methods, but to focus on the problem of uncertainty quantification. While in some cases, the Bayesian framework seems to be more amenable to missing and/or incomplete data ( Fig.11g ), our method is by no ways a substitution for this software. Rather, it provides a more amenable framework for the analysis of the variability in the predictions, and we base the following discussion on the credible intervals that our Bayesian framework provides.",

In particular, the coverage by the provided credible intervals is less optimal for the spatial random-effects model compared to the fully Bayesian one (64% vs 87%). In either of these models, the predictions obtained by holding R 0 constant, aggregated over the whole data, yields confidence intervals that are too narrow, and predictions that are completely off.

We thus consider policies that divide the daily contact rate by a certain factor, rather than in absolute value. On an aside note, one could envision assessing a given policy's effective slashing of the contact rate using population census data (for the structure of the household) as well as general mobility data. Historical data could indeed be used estimate baseline contact rates, while current mobility data would reflect the effective contact rate associated to a given policy.

As such, it is only valid for the first stages of the epidemic but not for long-term predictions of the disease, where traditional SEIR models are typically better suited to the task. Our goal here is to assess the speed at which hospitals can be swamped with patients at the beginning of the epidemic, and to understand how the variability impacts our selection of a course of action mitigating the social and economical costs associated to a complete lockdown of a geographical region. We also want to assess the efficient of alternation-based scenarios, in which the population would remain under lockdown for x days (that is, a state of activity in which the normal number of daily contacts is divided by a factor y), and pursue almost regular activities for the remainder of the week.",

As such, there might be a few discrepancies with the current observed numbers -but again, the focus of this paper is to assess the impact of the added variability on the uncertainty of the projected scenarios rather than on the accuracy of the scenarios themselves, so as to answer the following question: how informative truly are our predictive scenarios?",

These have to be contrasted against the predictions we can obtain in Panel 17(B), where the group-specific R for France is used to draw the predictive scenarios. Note in particular the lack of consensus between the outputs of these scenarios: for the general mean R 0 , slashing daily contacts by 60% is sufficient to obtain prevent hospitals from overflowing within the next two months. This is barely sufficient for the group-specific R (with much longer resolution horizon), and scenarios, such as alternating 3 days of lockdown with an 80% reduction in the daily contact rates with four days of business as usual is no longer sufficient to resolve the healthcare overflow. This highlights the importance of using the group-specific reproductive rate. Figure 17 : Spatial Random-Effects Model: France. Comparisons of the outcomes of the different strategies. We compare the estimated likely trajectories in terms of occupied hospital beds using various R: the group's specific and tailored Bayesian R, as well as an overall, general R estimated from the aggregated data. We note the substantial difference in the impact on the healthcare systems that the aggregation vs the spatially heterogeneous R yield.

Indeed, using a spatial and temporal random-effects model, we have shown that the added variability is necessary to (a) provide better coverage of the confidence intervals, and thus, more appropriately quantify the uncertainty associated to a certain prediction or the effect of a given policy and (b) explain rare events and understand the formation of outbreaks -which averaged models would not allow and which are nonetheless crucial elements to take into account when weighting different scenarios.",
