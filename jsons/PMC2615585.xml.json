            "text": "Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is an arthropod-borne virus belonging to the genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes to equines, birds, and humans and causes a febrile disease (including encephalitis) with a significant frequency of fatal outcomes. With an overall case fatality rate of approximately 36% (Deresiewicz et al., 1997), it is the most severe of the arboviral encephalitides. EEEV is a spherical enveloped virus with an 11.5-kb genome consisting of single-stranded positive-sense RNA. The 5\u2032 end of the alphavirus genome encodes for the nonstructural proteins (NSP1-4), and the 3\u2032 end of the genome encodes for the structural proteins (core and envelope proteins). The E1 and E2 proteins, virally encoded surface glycoproteins, are the target of numerous serologic reactions and tests. The E2 protein is the site of most of the neutralizing epitopes (Roehrig, 1986), and the E1 protein contains more conserved cross-reactive epitopes (Dalrymple et al., 1976, Wolcott et al., 1984). Apart from the 6 C-terminal codons, the E1 gene is largely conserved among alphaviruses (Powers et al., 2001), although there is sufficient diversity to allow selection of primers and probes that are specific for the EEEV genome.",

This virus belongs to the Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus serocomplex within the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae. SLEV is endemic in the United States and circulates in a transmission cycle involving Culex mosquitoes and passerine birds (Tsai and Mitchell, 1989), with humans and other vertebrates as incidental hosts. Clinical disease caused by SLEV infection can vary from mild symptoms, including febrile illness and headache, to severe disease, including meningitis and encephalitis. Reports of case fatalities range from 5% to 20% (Tsai and Mitchell, 1989), although the numbers are higher still among the elderly population. The virus has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 11 kb. The 5\u2032 end of the viral genome consists of genes for the structural proteins, and the 3\u2032 end consists of genes for the nonstructural proteins. The NS5 gene encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is reported as being the most highly conserved of the Flavivirus nonstructural proteins (Iacono-Connors and Schmaljohn, 1992, Scaramozzino et al., 2001).",

However, serologic tests have certain limitations; cross-reactivity of flaviviral antibodies is problematic in immunoglobulin M capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and plaque reduction neutralization is time consuming, is cumbersome, and requires biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) containment (Calisher, 1994, Martin et al., 2004, Russell and Dwyer, 2000). The traditional method of virus isolation also has the latter limitations, and in addition, because the period of viremia is generally short, the likelihood of obtaining an isolate is low (Calisher, 1994). Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a rapid and sensitive method that is being used increasingly as an adjunct to serology for the diagnosis of arboviruses. Case in point is the widespread use of PCR for the detection of West Nile virus (WNV) (Briese et al., 2000, Lanciotti and Kerst, 2001).",

The resultant 146-bp fragment of the E1 gene of EEEV was cloned into the PCR-Blunt II-TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The plasmid (pNT21) was linearized and used to transcribe a control RNA transcript containing the real-time RT-PCR target sequence, using the T7 RiboMax Large Scale RNA Production System (Promega, Madison, WI). The transcript RNAs were subjected to 2 rounds of DNase I digestion and were purified by phenol\u2013chloroform extraction and sepharose chromatography. The purified transcript was quantified by measurement of the absorbance at 260 nm. Ten-fold serial dilutions of genomic EEEV strain 69-7836 viral RNA and the transcript were made, and real-time RT-PCR was performed. A standard curve was constructed, allowing quantitation of the genomic viral RNA. Conventional RT-PCR was performed using primers SLE-NS5-F1 and SLE-NS5-R1 (Table 1) targeting SLEV strain MSI-7. A plasmid (pNT26) that contained the 63-bp NS5 target fragment was constructed as described above. The SLEV transcript was made and quantified, and using this transcript, genomic RNA was quantified as described above.",

The 2 SLE probes were each labeled with the reporter VIC\u2122 at the 5\u2032 end and a minor groove binder (MGB) (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) at the 3\u2032end. Amplification was carried out in a 25-\u03bcL volume reaction using the SuperScript III Platinum One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR System (Invitrogen), 0.5 \u03bcL of 5\u00d7 5-carboxy-X-rhodamine (ROX) reference dye, 400 nmol/L each of 4 SLEV primers, 500 nmol/L each of 2 EEEV primers, 75 nmol/L each of 2 SLEV probes, and 200 nmol/L EEEV probe. The reactions were incubated at 48 \u00b0C for 30 min, followed by 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, 45 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, and 60 \u00b0C for 1 min. A separate real-time RT-PCR for the detection of GFP was performed with the primers and probes listed in Table 1. The GFP probe was labeled with the reporter 6-FAM at the 5\u2032 end and the quencher 6-carboxy-tetramethyl-rhodamine (TAMRA) at the 3\u2032 end. The reaction consisted of universal buffer (Applied Biosystems), the forward and reverse primers at 900 nmol/L each, and 250 nmol/L probe (Tavakoli et al., 2007). The reaction conditions were as above. PCR reactions were performed using an ABI 7500 instrument (Applied Biosystems).",

Between 1964 and 2004, the greatest numbers of human cases in the United States occurred in Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, and New Jersey (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/arbor/eeefact.htm). SLEV, in contrast, is found throughout the 48 contiguous states, but periodic epidemics have only been documented in the Midwest and the Southeastern United States (including Florida) (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/sle/index.html; Wells et al., 1990). A molecular assay that detects both SLEV and EEEV, thus, has considerable application for patients suspected of having arboviral encephalitis who reside in these areas, as well as travelers who could have come into contact with infected mosquitoes.",

The targets for the PCR assay are sited within conserved regions of the genome, namely, the E1 gene of EEEV and the NS5 gene of SLEV. The assay is intended for patient CSF samples but can easily be used for vector surveillance. We found the optimal PCR kit for this assay to be the SuperScript III Platinum One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR System. The linear assay range is 5 to 5 \u00d7 106 gc/reaction for EEEV and 10 to 3 \u00d7 106 gc/reaction for SLEV. The sensitivity of the assay is 5 gc/reaction for EEEV and 10 gc/reaction for SLEV. The assay is specific, in that the primers and probes did not cross-react with any of the organisms in the specificity panel that we used. The assay detected all of the strains of SLEV (69 strains) and EEEV (12 strains) that we tested. We compared our assay with a previously published real-time TaqMan RT-PCR assay for the detection of SLEV, which targets the envelope gene (Lanciotti and Kerst, 2001). Although the 2 assays were similar in sensitivity and specificity, the previously published assay did not detect all SLEV strains; 4 of the 69 SLEV strains in Table 2 (CorAn 9275, CorAn 9124, GML 903797, and GML 903369) were not detected (data not shown). This is not surprising given that the primers and probe had multiple mismatches when aligned with the genome sequence of these strains; as many as 10 mismatches in total occurred for each of strains CorAn 9275 and CorAn 9124. In our SLEV assay, the primers and probes were selected to enable the detection of a greater variety of strains by targeting the conserved NS5 region.",

We would, therefore, recommend that if plasma or serum specimens are tested, the nucleic acid extracts from the specimens are not diluted before performing the GFP real-time RT-PCR assay to detect inhibition more accurately because the predilution may overcome some of the inhibitory effect.",
