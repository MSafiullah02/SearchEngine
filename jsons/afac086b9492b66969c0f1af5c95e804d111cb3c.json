            "text": "It is increasingly evident that China has attached more attention to discursive power in foreign policy since the early 21st century. Both top leaders and government agencies have been active in advocating for a new discourse on various international occasions. Previously, China has been reluctant to join the debate in international affairs, and been instead preoccupied with domestic affairs since the late 1970s. The situation has changed since 2009 because of China's rapid rise to become the world's second largest economy. With regard to the motivations behind the Chinese government's support for discursive power, the dominant explanation is based on the ''rise of China'' argument. However, this argument does not explain the causal relationship between China's rise and its discursive power strategy. So, this paper aims to clarify the motivation behind China's discursive power strategy through document reviews and interviews with mainstream scholars. It concludes that a discursive power strategy has been the fundamental principle of the Communist Party of China since its establishment in 1921. Since China's adoption of an opening-up policy in 1978, this tradition has been suppressed but not eliminated entirely by top leaders. As China continues to rise on the world stage, the principle will drive China to create a new political model rather than be a mere follower of the established political order.",

            "text": "The politics of discourse is one of the most recent topics of debate among scholars of international relations, with increasing numbers of scholars around the world beginning to conduct international relations studies from a discursive perspective. In fact, discourse studies has been a very important part of the IR academic community since 1980, previously emerging from post-colonialism, and before that from postmodernism, all of which highlight discursive elements, such as culture, ideology and other norms, as a special kind of social power resource. These perspectives hold different views on power than established mainstream theory (Foucault 1972a, b) . In Western liberal societies, discourses of power are almost exclusively adversarial and based on social competition. Power tends to be associated with competition at best or coercion and domination at worst. These alternative perspectives, however, suggest that the way we act in relation to a subject is not the most important thing, but rather it is how we think and talk about it, and who thinks and talks about it.",

            "text": "In reality, China places more emphasis on discursive power than other states. As a rising world power, Chinese leaders have paid much more attention to discursive power in international affairs. In particular, China frequently proposes international initiatives under the rhetoric of supporting the discursive power of developing countries. What's more, China takes seriously the reform of the IMF, WTO, World Bank, etc., strongly challenging the so-called unfair international system dominated by Western powers (Xi 2014a) . So, as a still-rising power, how China expresses itself will definitely determine its relationship with the established powers. Although this paper focuses solely on China's perspective of discursive power, it remains relevant to the potential new international order (which will be determined by many players); because China, as a newcomer, believes that the established order was solely drafted by Western powers. How China imagines the future and how it shapes the discourse of the future international order will absolutely impact the nature of its future interactions.",

In particular, the paper will challenge the dominant explanation of power transition theory, which sets out that China's discursive power strategy is just the result of China's rising power.

Particularly for top leaders, discursive power is regarded as significant factor in determining their political power distribution in the party. And Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out that, ''He who is inferior to Marx is not a Marxist; he who is equal to Marx is also not a Marxist; only he who is better than Marx is a real Marxist'' (Wang 1979) . Keen to pursue discursive power, the CPC Central Committee established the principle of independence at the Zunyi Conference in January 1935, and decided to maintain a level of freedom of discursive power in the Comintern. To dispel skepticism within the party about whether ''the people living in the mountain valley can produce Marxism'' after the rectification movement in Yan'an in 1941, the Chinese Communists took Maoism as their guiding position and stood up to the Soviet Union, further pursuing discursive power. After the People's Republic of China was founded, from December 1959 to February 1960, in conversation to political economics of Soviet Union (excerpt), Mao Zedong pointed out clearly that, ''the Communist Party of any country and the thinkers of any country must create new theories, write new books and have their own theorists'' (Mao 1999) . To defend China's discursive power, China launched great debates with the Soviet Union around the principles of leadership of the proletariat, Marxism, revisionism, etc., some of which contributed to some extent to the ultimate breakdown of the Sino-Soviet alliance.",

President Xi Jinping coined the Chinese dream in late 2012 and launched a strong wave of campaigns for a new political discourse domestically and internationally. Under the umbrella of the Chinese dream, Xi has also proposed multiple international initiatives, such as the One Belt One Road program and the Concept of Comprehensive Security, a new type of international relations based on win-win cooperation and upholding justice while pursuing shared interests, since he came to power in 2012 (Yang 2013) . All these initiatives can be regarded as China's endeavors for new discursive power domestically and internationally. China hopes to expand the influence of ''Socialism with Chinese Characteristics'' abroad through strategic efforts to build discursive power, especially to delegitimize the ''China threat'' theory overseas, dispel the doubts of other countries caused by the rapid increase in China's economic capabilities, and fully integrate into the international community. However, there remain some inaccurate views about how to understand China's discursive power, and opinions are not entirely uniform. Not only is the Chinese leadership's description of discursive power vague, but there are also many differences between decision-makers in diplomacy, propaganda, and foreign affairs, and between groups of scholars, especially since coordination and consultation mechanisms between various departments are not perfect. This produces a lot of paradoxical behavior on the issue of discursive power, causing confusion in the international community. Specifically, there are currently five views about China's international discursive power:",

Some articles interpret the so-called right to speak as the right to speak without real understanding, or even think that the ''right to speak'' is the right to be heard and ''have a say'' (Zhang 2010b) . These scholars, mostly from Marxism studies within China, believe that the capitalist system dominates the international system and blocks opportunities for discourse for developing countries. So, China can upgrade its discursive power through consolidating its ideological domination around the world (Wang 2013a), or through upholding a high level of confidence in its values, advancing its foreign language capacity, enhancing its international communication ability, explaining clearly the true meaning of the success of the Chinese road to the world, enhancing the discourse around socialist core values at the international level, and demonstrating the true appeal of Chinese values (Yu and Su 2015) . This opinion is flawed, as the moral critique of the Western discourse is inappropriate because the discursive power of Western countries is not only dependent on holding the monopoly right to speak. The core of discursive power consists of power relations, and the nature of discursive power is not related to any ''right'', but rather to ''power''.",

Considering modern China's experience of international political humiliation, most scholars of international relations adhere to the idea that backward nations tend to be disadvantaged at the hands of other states, and are unable to obtain significant discursive power (Zhang 2009) . Such an opinion is common among Chinese people. It inappropriately equates discursive power with the ''power to speak'', and deems that the key to China's discursive power is to enhance China's national strength, and that discourse is only the expression of power (Meng 2015) . In fact, there does not exist a correlation between discourse and economic or military strength. The militarily weaker party may have more ''right to speak'' than the militarily stronger party. The Vatican, for example, is a ''state within a country'', surrounded by Italy, but nobody will deny that it has more international discursive power than Italy (Knopp 1997) .",

            "text": "Third, some regard discursive power as the ''power of the media'', deeming that once you have the power of the media, you will master the ''right to speak''. A large number of scholars in journalism and communication believe that the ''right to speak'' is determined by whoever controls the media, and that China can obtain discursive power by strengthening the internationalization of Chinese media (He 2015; Bai 2015) . The group to whom the media belongs will naturally spread their discourse in the media. The most fundamental reason why China lacks international discursive power is because it does not control the media well enough (Wang 2009; Liu 2010; Liang 2009; Hu 2014) . However, discursive power does not depend on the media. A persuasive example is that despite the fact that the United States holds the world's largest media machine, and has significantly increased its output of media broadcasts to the Middle East Persian Gulf region since 2001, anti-American sentiment has risen rapidly in the Middle East since 2001, and the ''right to speak'' of the United States in the region has been seriously damaged. 1 Fourth, some regard discursive power as ''soft power'', deeming that discursive power depends on moral standards and cultural strength, and that as long as the country's culture and values are propagated, discursive power will be expanded. Since Joseph Nye of Harvard University first proposed the concept of ''soft power'', attention has turned from the tangible ''hard power'' of territory, armaments, military, scientific and technological progress, economic development, geographic expansion, military combat, etc., to the more intangible ''soft power'' of culture, values, influence power, ethics, cultural inspiration, etc. (Nye 2004 (Nye , 2008 . Some scholars assume there is a link between discursive power and soft power. They deem that as a country's moral standards rise, its ability to formulate discourse will also expand (Gao 2007; Tang 2008; Zhao 2015; Dai 2015) . Needless to say, a country's cultural and moral level is an important component in international discourse, but cultural and moral development does not necessarily lead to the enhancement of a country's discourse. Familiarity with a country's culture and history will not automatically translate into international discourse. Transformation of a country's cultural soft power to discourse also needs a ''strategic pivot''. Through diplomacy, trade, propaganda, international non-governmental exchanges and many other channels, and the integration of all aspects of cross-cultural and cross-border exchanges and the coordination of all resources, cultural soft power advantages could be translated into increased discursive power.",

            "text": "Fifth, some regard discursive power as ''diplomatic skill'', deeming that discursive power depends largely on political operations and idea contributions, and as long as a country enhances its diplomatic ability, discursive power can also be strengthened. Some researchers of international relations and foreign affairs regard discourse as an important indicator of national diplomatic skills, analyzing the discourse issue under the backdrop of the rise of modern China, and considering it an integral part of its national grand strategy |(d ' Hooghe 2007 ' Hooghe , 2010 ' Hooghe , 2014 Tan 2013; Wang 2013b) . From this point of view, the core of China's discourse consists of political power, and, as China grows, it should be prepared to assume more international responsibility, adopt a more transparent foreign policy, focus more on relations with neighboring and European countries, and when strategic reputation and economic interests are in conflict, adopt the principle that economic interests are subordinate to strategic prestige (Yan 2007 (Yan , 2014 . China only has two choices: China could become part of the Western ''kingship'', but that means it must change its political system and become a democratic country. Another choice is to establish China's own system which appears to be the current direction of China's foreign strategy (Yan and Jin 2009 ). Scholars make clear that China should be brave enough to challenge the universal values of the West, and establish China's own discourse (Pan 2008) . There are scholars who believe that international discourse reflects a country's ability to operate politically and contribute ideas. The ability to operate politically is mainly embodied in agenda-setting, rule-making capacity and international mobilization ability, while the ability to contribute ideas is mainly embodied in the ability to propose and promote new ideas and new concepts. To enhance China's international discursive power, we must greatly improve China's ability to operate politically and contribute ideas (Xu 2009 ). This opinion captures the key point that the clearer the political goals are and more mature the entire system is, the greater the international discourse will be. However, limiting the scope of discourse to political and diplomatic factors may bring short-term enhancement of the discourse, but in the long-term, may leave it unable to be consolidated entirely. China does not only need to establish its discourse politically, but also economically, socially, and culturally to consolidate its material foundation and social infrastructure.",

The main problem is that understanding of China's discourse comes mainly from just a few considerations and does not convey the real meaning of the discourse, limiting the discourse's strategy and its implementation. The reasons why such cognitive confusions exist are mainly related to China's longstanding weak position in modern history and traditional Chinese culture. Its longterm weak position caused China to mistakenly believe that only as a country becomes strong will it have discursive power, regardless of whether or not it proposes a new discourse and whether the discourse itself is rational and legitimate. In addition, the traditional Chinese culture regards discourse as the monopoly of knowledge, morals and status, standards and differences in science and technology levels and approaches to ethics between China and the West also limit the Chinese understanding of the nature of discourse.",

From these thinkers' points of view, the discourse expresses power relationships and helps to build and maintain a certain social order, which is generally considered the order in keeping with the interests of those who are dominant (Foucault 1972a (Foucault , b, 1977 . Discursive power consists of three elements: first, power facts are the fundamental base of discursive power. Only those powers that can maintain and overturn the social order can obtain discursive power. He who controls the discourse also controls the reality created by the discourse. Second, the shared rules among various social groups are at the core of discursive power. Language has its own rules and symbols, which are just a means of discourse, and their purpose is to create order. The key to taking control of discourse is to draft rules of priority in distributing resources-whether these rules are fully based on linguistic rules is not important. Third, social practice is the pivot of discursive power. The intermediary link between power facts and shared rules is a social practice. Formation of discourse cannot be divorced from social practice, since social practice makes the discourse a reality.",

And discourse is based on specific rules and logic that in turn are based on power facts. It relies on social practice to achieve the connection between shared rules and power facts, and thus, forms specific power relations. From an international political studies perspective, the discursive power of a country primarily depends on particular social facts and whether the position of power is clear or not. If the position is not clear, then the foundation of power facts is not strong and so it cannot obtain international discourse. At the same time, a country's discourse is also subject to shared rules and social practices. If a country cannot establish shared rules reflected by its position in power relations effectively, it cannot reinforce the relationship between the discourse system and power facts, damaging the discourse. One country can garner international discursive power by uniting power facts, shared rules and social practice together.",

Over the past three decades, sustained economic growth has greatly enhanced China's comprehensive national strength and continuously expanded its overseas interests. Meanwhile, China's emergence has aroused worldwide attention; and during the last decade of the 20th century in particular, various unreasonable concepts have sprung up in the international arena, such as ''The China Threat'', ''The Collapse of China'', ''China's Exports Inflation'', ''China's Economic Growth Exaggerated'', 'China as an Opportunity'', ''RMB Appreciation'', ''China's Threat on Energy'', ''China's Flourishing Age'', ''China's Responsibility'' and ''China's Neocolonialism''. These conjectures are full of doubts about China, and have become obstacles in its diplomatic activities (Zoellick 2005; Kissinger 1997; Nye 2005; Bernstein and Munro 1997; Chang 2001; Bergsten 2008; Rice 2008; Ikenberry 2008; Christensen 2011; Johnston 2013) . Among these opinions, some are well-meaning, some are unfair prejudices and some are conspiracies concocted by certain countries to Westernize China. Therefore, casting as illegitimate the ''China Threat Theory'' is regarded as a long-term strategic task by China's senior governmental officials (Li and Lu 2001) .",

A progressive China needs to establish its own international discursive power, and debates on this issue have been on the upsurge in different circles. For example, the linguistic field came up with the discursive power of the Chinese language, the commercial industry appeals for discursive power on the issue of price, ideological sectors call for discursive power in promotion, and diplomatic organs want discursive power in formulating international political agendas, etc. (Zhang 2008) . Although some proposals may have distorted the Chin. Polit. Sci. Rev. original idea of discursive power by narrowing down or generalizing the original concept, it cannot be denied that Chinese consciousness of international discursive power is growing rapidly, especially after its accession to the WTO in 2001, when China successively won the right to hold the 2008 Olympic Games and the World Expo 2010. Chinese leaders have become increasingly aware that China should be accustomed to being the focus of international attention and should actively introduce the world to a more genuine vision of China, creating an objective international opinion about China and building an image of a responsible power (Wen 2003 (Wen , 2012 Xi 2014b, a; Li 2006 Li , 2015 Liu 2012) . In particular, since Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, China has begun to increasingly highlight its discursive power strategy in governance, and has attributed ever-higher strategic significance to discursive power. Besides strengthening international communications, China also emphasizes its influence in high technology, international institutions and other international affairs (Xi 2015b) . So, China has gradually formulated a strategy for discursive power that contains setting facts straight, innovating rules, and making breakthroughs in social practice.",

For instance, in the disputes over ''China's market economy status'', China has been under consistent discursive pressure from the international community. The reason is that China is a ''heterogeneous'' socialist country (Krauthammer 1995) . Ever since the 1990s, the ''failure'' of the socialist camp has imposed unprecedented ideological pressure on China. Western discursive attacks used terms such as ''Grand Failure'', ''Collapse of China'', ''China Threat'', ''China's Responsibility'', and ''China's Neocolonialism'', or the current ''assertive China'' and ''China's Arrogance''. Socialism with Chinese Characteristics has remained under high pressure from Western discursive power (Brzezinski 1989; Chang 2001; Nye 2010; Swaine 2010) . For most Western audiences, China is still regarded as an abnormal regime because of its socialist and authoritarianism system under the political leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Not only is their economy still growing, it has been said, but they violate their people's rights-the ''butchers of Beijing'' (Barr 2011) .",

Entering the new century, China has gradually grown into a new economic giant gaining worldwide attention. China's international status and influence are growing dramatically and due to certain development characteristics that are different from other developing countries, the international community has become skeptical of China's identity as a developing country and many developing nations no longer treat China as an equal counterpart. Although China has initially taken on the shape of a giant country in light of its aggregated economic power, the size of the population has offset the significance of its GDP growth. It is hard for China's top leaders to persuade the domestic audience to acknowledge China as a developed country or to convince the international audience to identify China as developing country (Pu 2012; Pu and Schweller 2014) . So, over the long-term China will remain a developing country as determined by its social development level and a great gap in per capita development level compared with developed states. There is a discrepancy between the characteristics of a superpower and of a developing country, driving China into crises of discursive rupture when expressing itself to the outside world (Zhao 2010) .",

China's recognition of discursive power stemmed from anti-Western sentiments fermented in the mid-late 1990s. From China Wakes, and The China that Can Say No, to Unhappy China published in 2009, it can be seen that a sense of nationalism has spread from the grassroots level to the academic and cultural field (Li and Liu 1996; Fang et al. 1999; Song and Wang 2009 ). Entering the 21st century, more and more scholars are showing a strong negative attitude to the hegemony of Western discourse. They have launched debates in the academic community on ''universal values'' and ''the Chinese model'' which encourage Chinese academics to compete with their Western counterparts for new political discourse (Pan 2008; Chen 2010; Zhang 2011) . At the 17th CPC National Congress in 2007, President Hu Jintao for the first time elevated the promotion of China's soft power to a national strategic height, and formulated a key strategic objective to strengthen Chinese culture's competitiveness overseas for the sake of winning international discursive power (Hu 2007) . From then on, China has made it a strategic goal to enhance its discursive power by insisting on influencing the overall strategic situation on the basis of soft power. More significantly, China's new generations of top leaders insist that these ideologies shall be viewed under specific historical, social and cultural conditions, for example, the issue of human rights should involve concrete rights and specific content; abstract human rights applicable to the entirety of mankind shall never be accepted (Xi 2013) . For President Xi and his colleagues, discursive power is regarded not only as an important part of the soft power of China, but also as substantial indicator for realizing the Chinese dream. China will be great nation domestically and great power internationally.",

Some international observers also note some of their shortcomings, for instance arguing that the term is ambiguous, and may contradict with the peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue (Glaser and Medeiros 2007) . Many people doubt that China can ''rise'', believing that China's multiple economic and social problems impede its rise, and will interrupt its progress in becoming a powerful state. They insist that ''rise'' is an optimistic portrayal of China's current social and economic development (Chu 2004) . Others oppose the idea because of its meaning of ''power transfer''. They believe using this terminology to relieve tensions with neighboring countries cannot help in practice (Yan 2004) . Many people think that the term ''peaceful rise'' is provocative, and can be easily misinterpreted as meaning that China is keen to reach for hegemony like United States, and is trying to expand. In particular, many leaders of China's neighboring countries have expressed varying degrees of concern. Among this group, the most typical viewpoint expressed is that of former Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who believes that Asia-Pacific countries welcome China's prosperity and development, but are also concerned about their own national security (Lee 2009).",

Traditionally, ideological work is unified under the leadership of the Small Leading Group of Publicity and Ideological & Political Work, which is the decision-making advisory and coordinating body for publicizing the ideological work of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and an ad hoc organization subordinate to the Political Bureau. In addition, its members are often indeterminate, and include principals from the main divisions of the party, government and publicity. They are usually constituted by the Head of the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee, the Director of the State Council Information Office, the Minister of Education, the Minister of Culture, the Director General of International Radio, Film and Television, and so on. Moreover, the group is attended by principals from the Xinhua News Agency, People's Daily and other relevant departments, who perform the functions of coordination, communication, decision-making, deployment and monitoring the implementation of foreign policy and the relationship between the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau and the propaganda departments of the party and government. This group is rarely exposed in the media and highly secret in its work procedures, but it regularly convenes meetings and performs unified management over propaganda, ideas, culture, ideology, spiritual civilization construction and other areas. To strengthen the ideological leadership, in 2003 the CPC Central Committee nominated Mr. Li Chuangchun, in charge of ideological work, for full-time membership of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau. This nomination makes the ideological leadership team even more powerful, and the ideological leadership more vigorous in China's political system because the standing members of the Political Bureau hold the most powerful position in China's political decision-making process. Therefore, the mechanism of ideological leadership in China has been strengthened, and many interviewed media professionals have expressed strict control of public opinion since 2003.",

So, it is impossible for mass media to violate the directions from central government, with very few exceptions such as Nanfang Zhoumo and other liberal media. From the beginning of the reform and opening-up era, the Chinese government has strengthened its overseeing and manipulation of mass media reports to manage mainstream public opinion and consolidate domestic discursive power. The real challenge to China's discursive power strategy is from the cyber sphere. As a milestone, China gained access to the international internet in 1994 and began to be an important player in the cyber sphere. In 2014, there were more than 648 million active internet users, 331 million Internet Protocol Addresses, near to 20 million domain names, and 3.35 million websites in China (China Internet Network Information Center 2015) . Over the past 20 years, China has become the world's number two cyber power. However, there were more than 16 agencies involved in internet managerial affairs and no unified managerial system for cyber affairs before May 3, 2011, when the State Council decided to set up the State Office for Internet Information. To strengthen the management of cyber and information security, the Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the CPC in 2013 made the decision to upgrade the internet leadership and managerial system. So, on February 27, 2014, the Central Internet Security and Informatization Leading Group were established, and President Xi Jinping was appointed as its Director. As the working office, the State Office for Internet Information provides staff and other coordinating services. With the establishment of these strong organs, China began to strengthen its management of cyber affairs. On July 6, 2015, the first draft of the Cyber Security Law of the PRC was published to invite suggestions for revision from public opinion. The draft indicates that China wants to consolidate discursive power on cyber security domestically, and that China will become more active in participating in international cyber security dialogue, and seek more international discursive power on cyber affairs. Typical examples include the election of Mr. Lu Wei, director of State Office for Internet Information, and Jack Ma, President and CEO of Alibaba Networking Technology Co., as members of the Global Internet Governance Alliance, and the selection of Jack Ma as Co-chairman of the Global Internet Governance Alliance Council in 2015.",

In China, media is the best friend of diplomats, and some diplomats are even former journalists. The situation has changed since the 2003 campaign for dealing with the SARS virus. In that campaign, the Chinese media began to play more radical role in foreign policy than ever before. It was permitted to disclose concealed details and even to criticize government officials. Since then, the Chinese media has gained more freedom to report on international affairs, and some media organizations have also began to conduct more ambitious strategies of internationalization, which is encouraged by the government. Therefore, compared with the Western media's mission of reporting facts, Chinese media takes on the task of advancing China's discursive power and soft power abroad. So, what Chinese media really cares about is not being recognized by others but gaining the legitimacy to lead the Chinese discourse.

For example, foreign ministers and top leaders usually have dialogues with the general public domestically and internationally through public speaking, interviews, online discussions and drafting articles in newspapers of other countries. In recent years, President Xi Jinping and Primer Li Keqiang have become more active in publishing the newspaper articles during their visits abroad. These endeavors can be regarded as Chinese public diplomacy for new discourse.",

            "text": "In 2009, President Hu Jintao mentioned public diplomacy, and people-to-people as well as cultural diplomacy, for the first time in a very important meeting, highlighting the significance of public diplomacy in China's foreign affairs. This statement is regarded as a milestone in China's public diplomacy efforts. Since then, more and more top leaders, government agencies and even social actors have joined in the development of public diplomacy. A typical example is that Mr. Zhao Qizheng, the director of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the CPPCC from 2008 to 2013, led a big campaign for public diplomacy studies. Other important leaders like China's State Councilors, Foreign Ministers and Culture Ministers are also actively involved in developing public diplomacy, to create new discourse within the international community. More substantially, as an institutional innovation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs established a new Public Diplomacy Office as an alternative to the Public Diplomacy Division of the Information Department. This change indicates that public diplomacy is the mandatory duty of all officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and its embassies and posts abroad, rather than just as the responsibility of the Information Department. As a result, Chinese ambassadors are required to make public lectures, accept media interviews, have dialogues with local communities, etc. MOFA has also established a coordinating mechanism among various ministries and agencies involved in foreign affairs, and have set up an advisory commission on public diplomacy with responsibility for evaluating the performance of Chinese public diplomacy. Besides MOFA, other institutions including the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Commerce, and even local governments have also joined the public diplomacy team. Confucius Institutes, Chinese Culture Centers, the Beijing Olympic Games, the Shanghai Expo and other efforts can be seen as excellent examples of Chinese public diplomacy programs.",

Particularly since the 18th Congress of the Communist Party China, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, China has launched a new wave of charm offensive campaigns worldwide, including first lady diplomacy, which are more progressive than before. All these efforts are intended to defend Chinese discourse and China's political system, and enhance the Chinese dream abroad. In addition, the Chinese government conducts public diplomacy activities in the military, trade and academic fields, adding to China's image by means of practical actions. Many overseas economic activities such as the One Belt One Road initiative, the New Model of Big Power Relationships, and the AIIB indicate increased foreign promotion activities, and are trying to express China's intentions and interests by internationally adopting this widely used public relations tool. Behind these efforts, China's top leaders just want to win discursive power on the world stage. And this mission has been clear and consistent from the beginning of China's advocacy of public diplomacy.",

            "text": "Since the end of the Cold War, influenced by the termination of the war and the Tiananmen Events, China has been treated negatively as a red and dangerous country (Bernstein and Munro 1997; Bork and Ding 2000; Kristof 1995) . However, the international department of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) has investigated the image of various countries in global public opinion since 2005. The results show that China's national image has been consistently rising in the minds of people around the world. Within the sample under investigation, there was not a country in which the number of people with a negative attitude towards China exceeded 50 percent among the total responses; instead, the number of people bearing the opinion that China has had an active and positive impact on the world exceeded those of the US and Russia. 5 Similar results have been obtained from many civil investigation institutions such as the Pew Center. According to the Pew Center's latest report, China is viewed positively and has good image in 19 of 38 nations. China wins its highest ratings in Africa (70 %), Asia Pacific (57 %), Latin America(57 %) and predominantly Muslim Middle Eastern nations (52 %). However, China is seen less positively in much of Europe and North America. In the US, less than 40 % have a favorable view. 6 How could all of these be possible? In term of power transition, China has seen an evident rise in economic and military power, but such a rise has not changed the power relationship between China and Western countries, especially between China and the US. The rise in China's power does not bring an underlying motive for structural change, and it is impossible to generate fundamental change in international public opinion from power transition. Rather, China's success depends more on China's foreign strategy. Instead of ''Exporting Revolution'' emphasized during the Mao Zedong times, what China advocates nowadays is non-interference with the domestic affairs of other countries, including the provision of assistance without any additional political conditions which provides quite a different development model from Western countries. All of these factors have formed an evident contrast with foreign policies conducted by the US over many years, including humanitarian intervention, development assistance with additional conditions regarding human rights and good governance, as well as aggressive diplomacy including alliance strengthening and regime change. In addition, in the views of international society, and especially those of emerging economies and developing countries, the Chinese development model has significant differences from the Washington Consensus model that is consistently promoted by the US, representing two alternative types of development route. However, the Iraq War in 2003 and the world financial crisis in 2008 crushed the development model led by the US and shook the US' international leadership in discursive power, hence, China's discursive power obtained great benefits.",

Since 2003, the change in China's diplomacy has been mainly demonstrated in its establishment of the strategic route of Peace and Development. Different from the Western strategy of showing off their hard power, China has paid great attention in adopting strategic planning that focuses on enhancing its soft power while developing its hard power, taking a series of new measures in fields including ideology, external publicity and public diplomacy, and bringing forward a whole new set of discursive systems which are largely different from previous systems. The discursive system brought forward by China did not comply fully with the Western system, and instead raised a new system in comparison with the Western model. On 11 May, 2004, Mr Joshua Cooper Ramo, Senior Consultant at Goldman Sachs and Adjunct Professor of Tsinghua University, published a research report named The Beijing Consensus through the UK-based think tank The Foreign Policy Centre, which triggered heated discussions about the Chinese model in international society (Ramo 2004) . Chinese scholars have started lively debates on ''universal values'' and the ''China model'' since then. It is evident that China does not acknowledge the Western concept of universal values, but instead seeks a Chinese discourse based on long history and great legacy of civilization. This motivation is expressed clearly in Xi Jinping's proposal for the Chinese dream. This slogan indicates that China will not only be great power in material capabilities but be great in discursive power as well. With China's continuous rise on the world stage, the principle will drive China to create a new political model, rather than just follow the established political order.",

As Chinese leaders accelerated the exploration of a new development model and support for the diversification of development patterns both domestically and abroad, senior Chinese Government officials began to reveal their confidence about China's discursive power. At the beginning of 2003, Chinese leader Hu Jintao advocated the Scientific Outlook on Development on various occasions, putting it at the core of China's discursive power strategy. The proposal of the Scientific Outlook on Development typifies Hu Jintao's approach to discursive power. On October 14, 2003 at the Third Plenary Conference of the 16th Central Committee of the CPC, the Scientific Outlook on Development was advanced in a clear, formal way for the first time in the party's literature. It advocated insisting on a holistic approach, putting the people first, establishing a comprehensive, coordinated and sustainable development concept and promoting the all-round development of economic society and human well being. 2 To promulgate and implement the Scientific Outlook on Development, the CPC organized a large number of learning activities. In addition to initiatives at the Central Party School, the National School of Administration and Party Schools at all levels, in March 2005, the CPC also established the China Pudong Cadre College, the China Jingangshan Cadre College, and the Yanan College of China as three state-level training bases. These initiatives aimed to train a large majority of leading cadres. In addition, in January 2005, the party developed educational activities on the theme of ''education on maintaining the advanced nature of Communism'' and ''studying and implementing the Scientific Outlook on Development'', to consolidate the political discursive power of the Scientific Outlook on Development. As a result, at the 17th National Congress of the CPC, held on October 15, 2007, the Scientific Outlook on Development was written into the CPC Constitution, alongside Deng Xiaoping theory and the important thought of the Three Represents, and was defined as the scientific system of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics. In addition, Chinese leaders have strongly advocated the concept of Harmonious society, Harmonious world, and the advancement of China's national innovation system, as strategic tools to increase the discursive power of China.",

In September 2004, at the Fourth Plenary Session of the 16th CPC Central Committee, China formally announced to the world that it will stick to the road of peaceful development. 3 In December 2005, the Chinese government published a White Paper on China's road of peaceful development, elaborating on its contents, and proposing a clear goal of ''build[ing] a harmonious world of lasting peace and common prosperity'' (Information Office of the State Council ed 2005). Some scholars summarized it as, ''Rise in peace, by peace and for peace''",
