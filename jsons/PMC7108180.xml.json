Initially applied to the bacterial microbiome, deep sequencing has similarly detected a multitude of viral genome sequences, and changed hitherto common views on persisting viral infections [1], putting forward the concept of the \u201cvirome\u201d in general, and of the \u201chuman viromes\u201d in particular [2]. While the numeric summary of viral genome sequences is mind-blowing, even after careful annotation and curation through refined bioinformatic tools, the utility of massive parallel sequencing has been prominently demonstrated in epidemiologic cluster analysis, for example, leading to the identification of a novel arenavirus as the cause of donor-derived death of 3 solid organ transplant recipients [3], or of a novel human polyomavirus causing lethal multiorgan failure in a pancreas transplant recipient [4]. Given the technical and bioinformatic advances as well as the declining laboratory costs, the application of deep sequencing to identify etiologic agents in clinical samples has been approached in different pathologies, including those caused by community-acquired respiratory viruses (CARVs).",

Conceptually, it is clear that the human virome is different in different organ sites and body location (eg, the gastrointestinal, urogenital, or respiratory tract) and is subject to dynamic changes of the viral constituents, not only as a result of physiological changes (eg, dietary, hormonal, aging), but also due to complex pathological alterations such as trauma, inflammation, and immune responses [5], exemplified in inflammatory bowel disease or transplantation [6, 7].",

H. Hirsch, unpublished observation). Thus, every step of the wet and dry laboratory procedure is dependent on the methodology, and may yield potentially different results [8].

The prospectively collected epidemiological data and nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) samples of SARI cases were identified through a national surveillance study conducted by the Uganda Virus Research Institute from 2010 through 2015. The virome present in influenza virus\u2013negative NP/OP samples was analyzed by deep sequencing enriching for viral sequences. The epidemiologic data were collected by sentinel hospitals in 9 different geographic areas, and hence focused on SARI (eg, pediatric and adult patients admitted to hospital for severe influenza-like illness), thereby combining feasibility and clinical significance. The numbers are impressive, as 3921 SARI cases were identified, 335 (8.5%) of which were influenza-positive NP/OP samples. Of the remaining 3586 cases of influenza-negative SARI, 2901 had spatial and temporal data available to pinpoint 9 clusters involving 301 (10.4%) influenza-negative SARI cases. Notably, the demographic characteristics of the Ugandan SARI cases indicated that mostly young children were enrolled, 80% of whom were <1 year of age, both within and outside of clusters. Although coughing and shortness of breath were leading features of SARI cases of both clustered and nonclustered cases, fever with temperatures >38\u00b0C and stridor were significantly more frequent in cluster cases than in noncluster cases.",

These numbers compare well with results from resource-rich settings testing symptomatic children and adults using multiplex nucleic acid testing (NAT) [13\u201315], whereby the detection rate in children was around 70% and significantly higher than the 30% found in adults [13], and where human rhinoviruses/enteroviruses together accounted for >45% of the detected CARVs [13]. While this suggests that, by and large, a significant part of the pathogens could have been detected by multiplex NAT for CARVs, the deep sequencing approach of this study revealed a number of remarkable surprises, which may help to close the gap on at least 30%\u201350% of the CARV-negative multiplex NAT results [16].",

Similarly, the discovery modus of deep sequencing identified more somewhat expected pathogens in that age group, such as human herpesvirus 6 and parvovirus B19, for which similar arguments could be made. By the same token, it is surprising that other viruses were not reported, some of which had been proposed to be associated with respiratory symptoms or febrile tonsillitis such as BK virus and other polyomaviruses [21]. Similarly, the complete absence of the apparently ubiquitous anelloviruses, which have received much attention in studies of respiratory samples from patients with inflammatory conditions or transplantation, is notable [7, 22\u201324].

Remarkably, 5 cases were caused by genotype B4, and could be traced back to an unvaccinated tourist from England and an outbreak in Manchester, United Kingdom, in 2011. Thus, global travel and outbreak have been linked. Even though undervaccination may play an important role in the Ugandan setting, it is clear that measles outbreaks have been a problem in resource-rich settings such as in Switzerland, where 105 cases have occurred in the year 2017 (incidence of 12.5 per million inhabitants), causing outbreaks among mostly unvaccinated individuals, despite the current 2-dose vaccination coverage of 85% and 93% of 2- and 16-year-old children, respectively [25]. Of note, measles virus also belongs to the human paramyxovirus family and is transmitted via respiratory fluids, but was detected alone as well as together with other viral pathogens in the present study by Cummings et al. Taken together, this report from resource-limiting settings is also of relevance for resource-rich countries and raises the question about how to best expand current first- or second-line testing for respiratory viral pathogens including CMV, parvovirus B19, and measles, and how to move to more deep sequencing virome analysis and comprehensive metagenomics in the near future.",

Not unexpectedly, certain factors were associated with the Ugandan SARI clusters, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, urban location, higher population density (eg, 431.5 vs 250 persons/km2), or higher median annual rainfall of 1293 vs 1150 mm/year. These differences, though statistically significant, need to be put in perspective, as the study was anchored in sentinel hospitals, typically located in urban areas where HIV status is more likely to be known, whereas SARI cases in rural areas may not have been equally able to seek hospital admission. Given the >10-fold higher average population density of Boston (5000 persons/km2), or Basel (7500 persons/km2), one might suspect that the associations in the Ugandan setting may have been a surrogate for other factors such as general hygiene standards, other medical conditions, and socioeconomic factors in certain suburban quarters. Similarly, the differences in annual rainfall of <10% need to be balanced against larger seasonal changes in short-term higher rainfall, which may be more important for case clustering and should be addressed in future studies. Despite a critical appreciation, this collaborative US\u2013Ugandan study combining epidemiology with state-of-the-art modeling and virology not only sets standards for resource-rich industrial settings, but provides next to HIV, Ebola, and malaria another proof-of-concept of feasibility and impact of innovative joint projects and partnerships between advanced research groups and dedicated institutions in resource-limited countries.",
