For logistical reasons, passengers from Spain and Turkey were transferred to a requisitioned hotel, where they provided swab samples and were isolated there until a negative result was obtained, at which point they continued self-quarantine at home. All samples were examined for SARS-CoV-2 by Real-Time PCR in designated reference laboratories.The passengers' median age was 27 years (interquartile range 22-40 years). All passengers reported no general or respiratory symptoms on arrival, except one person from Spain who had a high fever and cough, was transferred to hospital, and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The results of the screening are summarized inTable 1. There was a remarkably high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this cohort, despite the lack",
