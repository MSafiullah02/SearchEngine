Business dynamics and changes in the operating environment often give rise to continuous changes in application requirements that may be fulfilled only by changing the underlying ontologies. This is especially true for Semantic Web applications, which are based on heterogeneous and highly distributed information resources and therefore need efficient mechanisms to cope with changes in the environment. In our previous work we have developed the KAON ontology evolution framework that (i) enables handling the required ontology changes; (ii) ensures the consistency of the underlying ontology and all dependent artefacts; (iii) supports the user to manage changes more easily; and (iv) offers advice to the user for continual ontology reengineering. In this paper we apply the proposed approach on the MEDLINE system and discuss its benefits. First, we translated the MeSH/MEDLINE into a set of the ontologies by enriching the MeSH vocabulary with the set of rules and by eliminating some inconsistencies. Second, we showed that ontology evolution ensures the consistency between all related data. Third, we indicated how formal semantics provided by an ontology might be useful to improve the indexing in the existing MEDLINE system.",

The continual reengineering of a business system, i.e. the need to be better and better, is becoming a prerequisite for surviving in the highly changing business world. Although changes encompass several dimensions of a business system (e.g. people, processes, technologies), most of them are reflected on its IT infrastructure. For example, the establishment of a new department in the organisational structure will require the corresponding changes in the enterprise portal, underlying groupware system, skill management system, etc. Therefore, the adaptability of the implemented IT solutions directly defines the efficiency of a business system. However, building and maintaining long-living applications that will be \"open for changes\" is still a challenge for the entire software engineering community. Even though there are ongoing attempts to address this problem by providing IT systems with powerful concepts for self-management [KeCh03] , they focus only on changes caused by malfunctioning of a system. Indeed, most of today's management tasks are performed manually. This can be time-consuming and error prone. Moreover, it requires a growing number of highly skilled personnel, making the maintenance of applications costly.",

If the underlying ontology is not up-to-date, then the reliability, accuracy and effectiveness of the system decrease significantly [KlFe01] . For example, an obsolete classification of knowledge items in an ontology-based knowledge management system decreases the precision of the knowledge retrieval process. A typical example is the MEDLINE system 1 , the largest medical knowledge base available over the Internet, which is based on the MESH medical ontology. In order to stay in line with the state-of-the art in medical research, MESH is frequently updated. However, the ontology is not only extended with new terms (e.g. new diseases and medicaments); rather, the terms are often reclassified according to the latest research results. Therefore, in case the MESH is obsolete, not only that some relevant information will be missing, but also some wrong answers will be delivered.",

The task of the ontology evolution is to formally interpret all requests for changes coming from different sources (e.g. users, internal processes, business environment) and to perform them on the ontology and depending artefacts while keeping consistency of all of them. Figure 1 illustrates the role of the ontology evolution in a business system. Indeed, ontology evolution is defined as the timely adaptation of an ontology to the arisen changes and the consistent propagation of these changes to dependent artefacts [Sto04] . Since a change in the ontology can cause inconsistencies in other parts of the ontology, as well as in the dependent artefacts, the ontology evolution has to be considered as a process. It encompasses the set of activities, both technical and managerial, that ensures that the ontology continues to meet organizational objectives and users' needs in an efficient and effective way.",

MeSH is a controlled vocabulary used for indexing medical documents. The goal of the MeSH is to provide a reproducible partition of concepts relevant to biomedicine for the purpose of organising knowledge and information. In biomedicine and related areas, new concepts are constantly emerging, old concepts are in a state of flux and terminology and usage are modified accordingly. To accommodate these changes, the MeSH has to be updated as well as the articles indexed by the MeSH. Indeed, the main reason for using the MeSH as a case study is that the National Library of Medicine (NLM) produces the MeSH with an annual update cycle. Since the MeSH is used in real medical systems, management of its change is a critical issue.",

About 400.000 articles are indexed per year. The MeSH is now in its 40th year of production and is added to and otherwise modified on an annual basis. Beginning in 2002, over 2.000 completed references are added daily each Tuesday through Saturday, January through October (over 460,000 added last year). These modifications are then applied to the MEDLINE database; articles are not re-indexed, but the database is kept current with the current version of the MeSH. This is a time-consuming activity since two months (November and December) are needed to make the transition of the NLM to a new year of the MeSH vocabulary used to index the articles. The practical experiences with the MEDLINE show that it is easy to add something (either a descriptor to the MeSH or an indexed article to the MEDLINE), but it is hard to modify data that are already in the system. The authors of the MEDLINE system found out that meaning of change is important and that there is a need for an update model [Nel01] .",

The Meta-Ontology shown in Figure 4 represents the conceptual model of the MeSH.

Thus, we do not need to express this information explicitly. General rules are domain specific rules that are needed to combine and to adapt information available in the ontology. They are used to specify the relationship between ontology entities in the form of rules.

However, it has to be ranked on the top level (level of the concept \"Person\") because it covers all subtypes of the concept \"Person\".",

Firstly, different causes of changes (e.g. changes in the business environment, user's preferences, internal processes, etc.) have to be uniformly represented, in order to enable their efficient processing. Secondly, the changes have to be consistently resolved in the application, and their effects have to be propagated to all dependent business systems. Moreover, in order to control the resolution of the changes (e.g. the identification and overcoming of undesired changes), the responsible persons have to be able to make appropriate decisions. Finally, the continual business reengineering requires an automatic discovery of new changes by analysing the manner in which the application is used (e.g. the detection of trends in the users' behaviour). In order to fulfil these requirements efficiently, the managing of the changes in the ontology-based application has to be performed on the level of ontologies themselves. Therefore, the need for an efficient approach to the management of the changes in an ontology (e.g. ontology evolution) is obvious.",

This is probably the most critical issue in the whole research related to ontologies. Can the approaches scale when their application data increases drastically? In the Semantic Web environment, such a data explosion is inevitable. We did our best in tackling the complexity problem in the KAON ontology evolution system. In this paper, we presented the MEDLINE evaluation study that shows the applicability of the KAON ontology evolution approach on the large datasets. Moreover, we illustrated how formal semantics provided by ontologies can be used to improve the indexing in the existing MEDLINE system. In that way, our approach goes beyond a standard change management process; rather it is a continual improvement process.",

Each pair defines a main topic of the article and is considered as a whole. On the other hand, chemical contains a supplemental concept that describes more specific topics of an article. To model this information we have developed the so-called Document ontology. It contains only the metadata about biomedical articles and not the articles themselves. It includes all the previously mentioned ontologies. We note that we transfer all information about the MeSH but only about 100.000 indexed documents. The reasons for selected the MEDLINE subdomain are discussed later.",
