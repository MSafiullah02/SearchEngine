In this regard it comprises two key elements: (1) an event, and (2) a process of initial sensemaking, which means that a disruptive and extraordinary event is not necessarily a career shock in itself. For example, unexpectedly losing a mentor or valued coworker can be interpreted as a major shock by one person, whereas another may continue with \u2018business as usual\u2019. Indeed, Akkermans et al. (2018) argue that career shocks can have different attributes, which potentially determine their impact on people's careers, such as frequency, controllability, intensity, valence, and duration. For example, a single career shock may be low in intensity (e.g., a colleague leaves the organization), meaning it might not cause significant deliberate thought processing at first. However, if it happens multiple times (e.g., a number of colleagues leave), that is when frequency is high, the cumulative effect could be profound.",

While it is low in frequency, its low controllability makes it more likely to initiate a deliberate thought process (Akkermans et al., 2018). The degree of intensity, duration, and valence experienced also vary according to individual circumstances. For example, small business owners and people in retail or tourism are likely to experience a high level of intensity and duration, being at risk of losing their business and jobs. In terms of valence, the pandemic would generally be classified as negative, for example because of job insecurity, loss of income, emotional impact of social distancing, and increased general anxiety. Yet, as we will explain below, there may be positive consequences as well, such as spending more time with immediately family and not having to commute. Furthermore, although most occupations are negatively impacted, others are booming, such as software companies and home gym makers.",

Recent empirical studies have provided support for this lesson. Seibert, Kraimer, Holtom, and Pierotti (2013), for example, showed that career self-management (i.e., individual agency) and career shocks (i.e., external events) both served as antecedents of career decisions. Furthermore, Blokker, Akkermans, Tims, Jansen, and Khapova (2019) showed that career competencies were indirectly related to perceived employability via subjective career success (i.e., an \u201cindividual agency process\u201d), yet that negative career shocks weakened this relationship, whereas positive shocks strengthened it. Though not explicitly framed in terms of career shocks, Baruch, Wordsworth, Mills, and Wright (2016) argued that a major earthquake (i.e., an external event) explained the lack of a relationship between turnover intentions and actual turnover in their study. Furthermore, Baruch and Lavi-Steiner (2015) showed that career events moderated the effect of a protean career orientation on career outcomes, and Hirschi and Valero (2017) showed that there are dynamic patterns in how people's career decidedness relates to the impact of career events.",

            "text": "Event Systems Theory (Morgeson, Mitchell, & Liu, 2015) supports the notion of contextual and individual interactions. It argues that events are external, and that they are at the intersection of an action with its context (Rousseau & Fried, 2001). The theory also states that stronger events \u2013 characterized by novelty, criticality, and disruption \u2013 are more likely to initiate change. In other words, the features of the context (i.e., the career event) and the individual (i.e., decision making) together determine the outcomes of a career shock. Another helpful theory is Bourdieu's Theory of Practice (Bourdieu & Wacquant, 1992; Chudzikowski & Mayrhofer, 2011). According to this theory, practice (here: career behaviors) are the result of a dynamic interplay between people's dispositions (habitus), competencies (capital), and circumstances (field) (cf. Schneidhofer, Hofbauer, & Tatli, 2019; Townley, 2014). Bourdieu's theory argues that the habitus is embodied and highly stable, yet constantly reinforced or modified by experiences and events. This can lead to a situation of hysteresis, when a sudden crisis \u2013 resembling the notion of a career shock \u2013 can lead to adjustment problems because of a mismatch between individual and context. The ability of the individual to realign their habitus and capital with their field is a critical determinant of how successfully they can manage to deal with a career shock.",

One such thing is developing career competencies. To illustrate, Blokker et al. (2019) show that individuals who develop reflective, communicative, and behavioral career competencies are better able to capitalize on positive career shocks, such as unexpected promotions. Indeed, career competencies can help people to become more employable and engaged, and also more resilient in the face of setbacks (Akkermans, Brenninkmeijer, Schaufeli, & Blonk, 2015). Similarly, Seibert, Kraimer, and Heslin (2016) presented a broad range of psychological and behavioral strategies that individuals can use to become resilient when facing shocks. Psychological strategies include dealing with distracting emotions and nurturing a growth mindset, and examples of behavioral strategies are developing social relationships and participating in training activities. In all, the literature on career shocks shows that career resources and behaviors are important factors that can influence how well people cope with negative career shocks and capitalize on positive ones.",

And, two negative career shocks \u2013 having a mentor depart the organization and a significant organizational change \u2013 did not impact the employee's immediate intentions to attend graduate school, however, did impact the likelihood that the employee subsequently applied to graduate school 16 months later.

And, the shock of not receiving an administrative position negatively related to career satisfaction for early- and late-career academics, but not those in mid-career. Related research has also found that a significant national shock impacts individual's stress levels based on their family status. In particular, Ragins et al. (2013) examined the impact of the 2008 financial and housing market crisis (which they termed a \u201cnational shock\u201d) and found that fear of housing foreclosure was more strongly (positively) related indirectly to physical symptoms of stress, through negative home-to-work spillover, among individuals with family responsibilities, compared to those without dependents.",

First, studies should be designed to capture both short-term and long-term consequences. Although research is likely to find that this specific career shock has mostly negative career and psychological consequences in the short-term (e.g., job loss, reduced salary, lower career and work satisfaction), over time some individuals (see Lesson one) may move into more satisfying careers or job roles through their own proactive career behaviors. Indeed, research has demonstrated that employees who experience a novel and critical negative workplace event were more likely to engage in improvisation behaviors such as taking advantage of opportunities and \u201cthinking outside the box\u201d (Chen, Liu, Tang, & Hogan, in press). Conversely, other individuals may be in occupations that have been able to adapt to the pandemic requirements of social and physical distancing (e.g., education, journalism, and government), thus, the effects of the pandemic shock on respective career outcomes may be neutral or even positive in the short term. But the long-term economic consequences of social distancing and closure of non-essential businesses to industries dependent on government support may lead to severe budget cuts, and thus, job insecurity in the future. How long is \u201clong-term\u201d is not clear at this point, but many economists predict the consequences of this pandemic will continue well into 2021.",

            "text": "Second, it is imperative that studies either consider the focal individuals' life or career stage in developing any theoretical models explaining how the pandemic shock impacts career and work outcomes, or explicitly examine career or life stage as a construct within the model. For younger or early-career adults the Covid-19 pandemic may be their first experience through a significant global crisis, thus it may have long-term psychological effects on them. Moreover, from the accumulative advantage perspective (Miller, Glick, & Cardinal, 2005), a disruption to an early career path, caused by the pandemic, may have significant career consequences for several years. At the same time, very early career adults may be less likely to currently have children or a mortgage loan, giving them one less \u201cworry\u201d during the pandemic. Mid-career individuals may be more established in their careers, but for those who did lose their jobs, finding a new job may take more time. Mid-life also means one is more likely to have the added stress of work-family conflict and financial debt (Ragins, Lyness, Williams, & Winkel, 2014). For later-career adults and retirees, the pandemic may be especially stressful given the higher rates of death among the elderly and economic implications for pensions and investments. Some may take this opportunity to start retirement planning, others, especially in non-profit and health care sectors, are coming out of retirement to help their former colleagues cope with the high demand of their services. Resource-based theories, such as Job Demands-Resources theory (Bakker & Demerouti, 2017) and Conservation of Resources theory (Hobfoll, Halbesleben, Neveu, & Westman, 2018), and work-life spillover theories (Edwards & Rothbard, 2000) provide useful lenses to help identify how and why various work and family experiences associated with the pandemic crisis impact individual's career, work, and psychological outcomes across various life and career stages.",

While the negative impacts of Covid-19 are likely to be far-reaching, in some instances they may also incur positive career outcomes. In this respect we observe how a career shock that is initially negatively valenced may, over time, result in positively valenced career experiences, opportunities and outcomes (Seibert et al., 2013). Zikic and Richardson (2007), for example, argued that whereas unanticipated job loss might initially be viewed negatively, overtime it may give rise to opportunities for career exploration and change. Indeed, many of the managers in their study indicated that what had initially seemed like a negative experience, had ultimately allowed them to make positive career changes increasing their job-satisfaction and opportunities for life balance. Similarly, Rummel, Akkermans, Blokker, and Van Gelderen (2019) showed that for some young entrepreneurs, being forced to leave a corporate career was initially a negative experience but ultimately led them into becoming a successful entrepreneur.",

For example, in their study of retirement decisions, Vough, Bataille, Noh, and Lee (2015) reported that negative life events, such as death or sickness in the family, can create a re-evaluation of career aspirations leading to more positive life decisions. In a study among former professional athletes, Richardson and McKenna (2020) also provide a further example of how a negative career event, e.g. on-field career ending injury, provided an opportunity for former players to change their career direction. This provides an example of what Akkermans et al. (2018) refer to as triggering a deliberate thinking process. For some, the negative career shock brought about by Covid-19 might also bring about opportunities for changing work arrangements, career development and skill upgrades.",

            "text": "Indeed, there have been widespread reports about how some companies who might have been reluctant to allow employees to work from home are now discovering the added advantages including adoption of new forms of technology to cater to more flexible work arrangements (The Economist, 2020). This trend may also challenge the reported \u2018flexibility stigma\u2019 attached to those who take advantage of telecommuting (Golden & Eddleston, 2020; Kaplan, Engelsted, Lei, & Lockwood, 2018) which may, in turn, reduce both employee and employer willingness to use/offer it. Another potentially positive outcome of Covid-19 relates to the necessity to upgrade skills and competencies \u2013 particularly with respect to the use of technology. For example, whereas the move to online learning technologies can be unsettling for some academics who are more accustomed to and comfortable with the non-online classroom (Kilgour, Reynaud, Northcote, McLoughlin, & Gosselin, 2019), there have been growing reports about how academics have been upgrading their technological skills with the sudden demand to switch from in-class to online delivery and often in a matter of days if not weeks' notice (McKinsey & Company, 2020). Similarly, other workers whose organizations have moved to provide much-needed medical supplies are also developing new skill sets and finding new meaning in their work. The \u2018silver lining\u2019 of these trends may, therefore, be that some individuals who may have otherwise been reluctant to engage in proactive skill development and career behaviors have augmented both their short- and long-term career sustainability by effectively dealing with the current changes in work demands (De Vos, Van der Heijden, & Akkermans, 2020).",

We set out to achieve two goals: (1) to offer ways of understanding this impact through recent insights from the career shocks literature, and (2) to help guide future research based on these insights. Specifically, we argued that the impact will be the consequence of a dynamic interplay between contextual and individual factors, which will differ for people across career and life stages. Also, we argued that there may be differences between short-term and long-term consequences, for example that even though the pandemic is a negative career shock, it may have longer term positive implications for some. We hope that these insights will inspire scholars and practitioners alike to study and understand the work and career implications of Covid-19 as a career shock, as well as to support people in dealing with this shock.",
