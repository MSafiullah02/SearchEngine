In all cases, tissues were collected from the frontal lobe, which may or may not have resulted in direct sampling of inflammatory lesions. In addition, the PCR assays utilized ranged in sensitivity from 30 to 500 copies of target gene per reaction, which may have precluded identification of low viral loads.

However, if contamination was the sole explanation for this finding, M. canis would be expected to occur at an equal frequency in GME and NME cases and controls. In addition, the polyclonal sera used for IHC were diluted significantly to avoid background, which may have contributed to the negative results obtained from this assay. Alternatively, M. canis may be associated with primary disease pathogenesis or may have been present secondary to previously existing disease or patient immunosuppression. Interestingly, Mycoplasma pneumonia has been implicated as a common yet elusive etiology in acute childhood encephalitis,33 a disease with similar clinical and neuropathological features to that of GME and NME that also has a favorable clinical response to immunosuppressive therapy. Also, 5/11 GME and 6/27 NME cases received antibiotics before tissue collection, which may have altered the ability to detect or recover mycoplasmas in these cases. Of note, 2 Mycoplasma species were identified in several cases, which could support contamination with ubiquitous organisms or represent coinfection similar to Mycoplasma synoviae and Mycoplasma meleagridis in turkeys.34 It also is noteworthy that CNS mycoplasmosis involving other species can result in suppurative inflammation,19, 35 which is not a typical feature of GME and NME pathology. However, without a better understanding of the pathological processes that drive GME and NME, a role for M. canis cannot be excluded.",
