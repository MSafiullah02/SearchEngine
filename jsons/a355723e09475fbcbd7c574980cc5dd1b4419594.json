More and more, this form of analysis is now positively impacting the field of infectious diseases as well. This trend has been driven, on the one hand, by methodical improvements that make it possible to miniaturize and simplify test systems (7 Chapter 9, 10) and by the constant demand from many physicians for immediate test results, on the other. Meanwhile, the range of microbiological parameters available at the POC has been extended considerably (. Table 20 .1). A POCT result, however, should always be regarded and interpreted in the context of the clinical symptoms and the current epidemiological situation. Proper handling of POCT systems and strict consideration of pre-analytical limitations are decisive in obtaining reliable test results.",

In general, such tests can be carried out in a few simple steps by medical assistants or physicians without laboratory equipment or laboratory experience. An evaluable test result is delivered at the patient's bedside within not more than one hour. Under certain circumstances, patients can even carry out the test themselves, for example, as with some rapid HIV or malaria tests. Rapid microbiological tests usually verify microbial antigens. Less often, diagnostics is based on the detection of antibodies, e.g. in the rapid HIV test or rapid detection of heterophilic antibodies for diagnosing infectious mononucleosis (. Table 20 .1).",

Similarly, stool specimens of patients with gastrointestinal tract infections (Helicobacter pylori, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, adenovirus, rotavirus) are examined. However, the corresponding urine tests are also available to detect antigens in legionella and pneumococcal infections [14, 19, 27, 40] . Blood samples are usually used to detect antibodies (HIV, infectious mononucleosis), in particular cases, saliva samples are also used, as with some rapid HIV self-tests [9, 10, 15, 20, 42] This is where the time advantage associated with POCT over conventional diagnostics truly comes to bear: The total analysis time needed for rapid tests is usually only 15-30 minutes. Even under optimal conditions, analysis in a central laboratory cannot compete with this. Unless tests are carried out directly in the hospital's own lab, it often takes at least 1-2 hours to transport the specimens to the laboratory. Then, further time is needed for the actual analysis, including the necessary preparation (pipetting, incubation etc.), in addition to the time taken to report the results back to the requesting physician. Therefore, even for urgent requests, the total analysis time can be 1-2 days. There are many well-documented cases in infectious disease medicine, and particularly in critical care medicine, where such time savings can confer a very beneficial effect on therapeutic outcomes. Kumar et al. [26] have shown that the survival rate of sepsis patients in intensive care correlated directly to early, clinically effective initial antibiotic treatment. A treatment delay of more than 2 hours can lower the survival rate to as much as <60 %.",

The immediate availability of rapid HIV test results, for example, is helpful for decision-making about prophylactic antiretroviral treatment during childbirth or for people with occupational exposure to HIV. Intrapartum detection of group B streptococci in women in labor or the detection of plasmodia spp., including self-testing by patients with suspected malaria infection, are similar situations where POCT proves its merits. Here, too, the presence of a pathogen can be detected immediately using an antigen test whereupon early, targeted antimicrobial therapy can lessen or even prevent infection. POCT is also useful for guiding treatment of viral infections. The effectiveness of zanamivir or oseltamivir in influenza treatment depends on them being given no later than 36-48 hours after the first symptoms develop [32] . This approach is similar with the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Studies have shown that treatment with ribavirin in RSV bronchopneumonia is only successful if initiated early enough [5] .",

Such targeted situations not only arise in hospitals where there is the risk of an undetected pathogen spreading from patient to patient. There are also constellations when a transmission risk is associated with outpatients. For example, it is well known that a high percentage of patients coming to an HIV or sexual health clinic will skip their follow-up appointment because they fear an unfavorable diagnosis [43] . Although this avoidance behavior is understandable, it is a problem insofar as test results usually confirm infection (HIV, gonorrhea or chlamydia infection). As such, this has far-reaching consequences for the patients themselves as well as for their sexual partner(s). Data from the USA spotlight the extent of this problem. In one study of an HIV clinic, more than a quarter of the 68,000 people seeking advice and undergoing a conventional HIV test did not attend their scheduled 2-week follow-up appointment to pick up the test result. This was different when the rapid HIV test was performed. Only 2.3 % of the 33,000 people that had the rapid test left the clinic before receiving their test result [47] .",

Some POCT systems with potentially limited sensitivity to a suspected pathogen (e.g. influenza viruses, RSV, rotaviruses, noroviruses or adenoviruses) may be compromised by patterns of seasonal variations in the prevalence of that organism. This has a considerable impact on the clinical reliability of the test, as exemplified by the immunochromatographic rapid influenza diagnostic test (. Fig. 20.1) . A low prevalence (2.5 % in the example given) is expected at the start of a seasonal flu outbreak. Despite high sensitivity (80 % in this example) and very high specificity (95 %), the negative predictive value (99 %) of the test is expected to be significantly higher than the positive predictive value (29 %) . This is because the rapid test shows false-positive (49-fold) more often than true-positive (20fold) results under these circumstances. Not until the prevalence rises to 10 %, which can certainly happen during a severe flu outbreak, does the positive predictive value increase 20.7 \u00b7 Molecular biological (PCR) tests (64 %).

Detection is difficult owing to the limited amount of microbial antigens released with particular regard to colonization of mucous membranes associated with low pathogen counts (e.g. group B streptococcus in the vagina) or intracellular pathogens (e.g. chlamydia in cervical smears). New testing concepts had to be developed in order to detect these pathogens. Given the degree of analytical sensitivity required, PCR methods and other nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAT) with greater sensitivity have been added to the diagnostic arsenal and further developed for faster and easier use. The most important innovation in this context was the development of fully automated PCR kits and ready-to-use, reagent-coated single-use cartridges where all PCR steps (sample exposure, amplification and detection) run in sequence without any further manual input. The market leader is the GeneXpert system, supplied by Cepheid (7 Chapter 10). This fully automated PCR device is so easy to use that it is possible for trained staff to carry out the test near the patient, outside a laboratory setting. The American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the GeneXpert as a rapid test according to CLIA criteria. At present, the technique is listed in the \"moderate complex\" category, reserved for accredited laboratories. The \"CLIA-waived\" classification, meaning without being subject to laboratory use, is still pending. In addition to its primary function of pathogen detection, PCR can also be used for simultaneous analysis of resistance determinants or virulence factors. Linked assays incorporating multiplex technology allow more complex questions to be processed within one PCR run (e.g. detection of the following: S. aureus plus detection of methicillin resistance (mecA); two determinants (vanA and vanB) of vancomycin resistance in enterococci; clostridium difficile toxin B, also encompassing binary toxins and the tcdC deletion to detect highly virulent variants; mycobacterium tuberculosis also encompassing the rifampicin resistance (rpo) for detecting multi-drug resistant tuberculosis strains; simultaneous detection of influenza A, A/H1N1 and influenza B). The recently available i-system by Alere, which relies on isothermal amplification to detect the influenza A/B viruses and group A streptococci, (7 Chapter 10) can boast significantly better sensitivity and specificity compared to the antigen detection method with the correspondingly more reliable results [7, 23, 31] . Besides its i-system, Alere also offers the q-Analyzer as a fully automated NAT platform.",

Moreover, POCT can create extra work for staff that were not previously involved in diagnostic tasks and possibly needs to be considered in job planning [24] . The question inevitably arises, as to how far near-patient microbiological analysis actually adds value to justify the added financial expenditure. Comprehensive reviews of this topic are rare and, if available, do not give the full picture either. The main difficulty is that the issues relating to the weighing of cost-effectiveness against the medical benefit of near-patient testing are multifactorial and complex, with all aspects above and beyond this being closely interlinked.

However, this additional cost for PCR testing may be justified when considering that every MRSA transmission prevented by early detection can save a hospital several thousand euros in added costs. Therefore, the cost-benefit ratio shifts in favor of PCR. Even when each case is balanced against a successful coding in the DRG flat rate payment system, the added costs incurred by MRSA case of MRSA has the potential to impact negatively on public image and may result in lost revenue due to canceled admissions, which most hospitals should be eager to avoid [41] .",

Nevertheless, the current data suggest that the benefit of molecular MRSA screening will only outweigh the costs for patients with a particularly high MRSA risk, e.g. in areas with a high MRSA prevalence [41] .
