            "text": "In early April 2009, cases of human infection with 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus were identified in the United States [1,2] and Mexico [3], and the virus then spread rapidly to other regions of the world [4,5]. On December 20, 2009, more than 208 countries and overseas territories or communities had reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza A (H1N1), and at least 11,516 deaths had occurred [6]. The first case of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus infection in China was documented on May 10. From May to November of 2009, the number of reported cases in China was 69,160 [China Centre for Disease Control, CDC]. The majority of the early cases reported mild, influenza-like illnesses [7-11], but more severe infections have been reported as the pandemic spreads and the number of infected individuals increases. The greatest number of cases of 2009 H1N1 influenza infection resulting in severe clinical presentations and death have been reported in Mexico and other Western countries. The fatality rate of hospitalized patients with critical illness due to 2009 H1N1 influenza was about 10% [12-14] in United States and Mexico. The clinical features included fever and respiratory symptoms and death most commonly resulted from severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and refractory hypoxemia [7,15-18]. Obesity, underlying health conditions and delayed neuraminidase inhibitor treatment were the major risk factors for a poor outcome of infection [17,18]. However, the clinical outcomes and risk factors associated with 2009 H1N1 influenza infection in China remain to be determined and variables that could help clinicians to identify patients at high risk of infection would be valuable. Therefore, this report summarizes the clinical manifestations, clinical outcomes and the risk factors associated with death in hospitalized pneumonia patients associated with 2009 H1N1 influenza infections in Shenyang, China, during November to December 2009.",

During the 2009 H1N1 influenza epidemic, patients in clinics or emergency departments who presented with an influenza-like illness were tested for 2009 H1N1 influenza virus, and only those patients whose illness was complicated with pneumonia were admitted to our department. Patients with mild symptoms were isolated for treatment at home. Therefore, in total 68 patients were treated in our department between November 4th and December 31st. We retrospectively studied these 68 cases without any selection. The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University is a tertiary care center that includes obstetric services, pediatric wards and oncology wards, and treats immunosuppressed patients and HIV-infected patients. It is also a tertiary referral center for adult patients infected with 2009 H1N1 influenza, as appointed by the national government. However, this hospital is not a tertiary referral center for children and pregnant women infected with 2009 H1N1 influenza, so no children and pregnant women were involved in our study. All patients were confirmed positive for 2009 H1N1 influenza A by a real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay on respiratory specimens carried out at the CDC. All tests used standard CDC-based primers. All patients underwent chest radiography on admission. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of China Medical University.",

The body mass index (BMI) (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of each patient was calculated. Patients were defined as overweight if their BMI was 24 to 27.9 and obese if their BMI \u226528 according to the criterion established by the Working Group On Obesity In China (WGOC) in 2005. Lymphocytopenia was defined as an absolute lymphocyte count \u2264800 cells/\u03bcL. A cigarette index abnormality was defined as \u2265400. Blood gas analyses were tested by Nova Biomedical Stat Profile, and the oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) was calculated and abnormality was defined as values \u2264300.

A P value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. We performed bivariate analysis to compare the clinical characteristics of patients who survived with those of patients who died. We used multivariate logistic-regression models to further investigate associations between illness and mortality. Data with a P value < 0.05 was entered into the multivariate logistic regression model and data with a P value < 0.1 was kept in the model.

We concluded that severe illness resulting from H1N1 virus infection was more likely among male adults in Shenyang, which was consistent with other reports [19,21-25]. Persons aged 50 years or older showed a low incidence of 2009 H1N1 influenza infection, this may be due to \"protection\" by preexisting immunity resulting from previous exposure to H1N1 influenza infection, along with reduced outdoor activity by these individuals because of the fear of H1N1 infection. A recent study demonstrated that persons aged 50 years or older who were hospitalized with pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection were among those most likely to die, despite having lower hospitalization rates [14]. However, our findings did not support this conclusion, possibly due to the small sample size used in our study. Nevertheless, it is appropriate that clinicians should closely monitor elderly patients with pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza infection and treat them accordingly.",

Asthma is also considered a high risk factor for 2009 H1N1 influenza infection, however, our findings did not confirm this as only one patient in our study had asthma as a pre-existing condition. This discrepancy might be caused by the lower morbidity of asthma in China (approximately 2%) compared with Western counties (approximately 10-30%). COPD and heart disease are also considered high risk factors for 2009 H1N1 influenza infection, and in our study about two thirds of the patients with pre-existing medical conditions suffered from COPD or heart disease.

Whereas the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea was much lower than previously reported [7,15-18,28,29]. The results of laboratory tests indicated lymphopenia, hypoproteinemia, elevated LDH and CRP levels, which were consistent with other reports [19,29,30]. Abnormalities in the laboratory test results were more significant in patients who were admitted to an ICU and/or died than in patients who were not admitted to an ICU, but these abnormalities were not predictive factors in ICU admission or death. Our results were not consistent with the study in Taiwan which found initial lymphocyte count less 800/microL was associated with the development of respiratory failure [31]. Although lymphopenia was not a risk factor for death in our study, we found lymphopenia was restored after about five days in most surviving patients, whereas this was not observed in patients who ultimately died. The multivariate logistic-regression model results indicated that lymphopenia that did not resolve after five days was a risk factor for death. Furthermore, we determined the CD4 and CD8 T cell counts in most of the patients included in our study. The results indicated a reduction in CD4 and CD8 T cell counts in about half of the patients during the early stage of 2009 H1N1 virus infection, which was similar to previous reports in China [7,32]. These findings indicated that lymphopenia was mostly caused by T cell reduction, in particular a reduction in CD4 T cells. We were unable to determine whether the low immunity was pre-existing or caused by H1N1 infection because we did not know the basic values for each patient. During the severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) epidemic, lymphopenia was considered to be caused by the virus infection but further studies are needed to investigate the precise host immune response to 2009 H1N1 influenza virus. These results suggest the physicians should pay close attention to patients who are infected with 2009 H1N1 influenza virus, who are also obese or have experienced long-term lymphopenia.",

A report into 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza also indicated that 29% of the patients displayed bacterial coinfection, which might have contributed to the death rate in the current pandemic [33]. In our study, only 16% patients had positive blood or sputum cultures, and most of these pathogens could potentially be responsible ventilator-associated pneumonia. The majority of bacterial co-infections were drug-resistant bacteria such as A. baumannii and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, whereas non drug-resistant bacteria were found predominantly in other reports [33,34]. This result may reflect the abuse of antibiotics in China, and Chinese physicians should take measures to ensure protection against respiratory machine-related pneumonia, especially involving drug-resistant bacteria. To achieve this, physicians, nurses and patients should obey the rules of segregation and sterilization strictly and pay attention to bacteria contamination and the rational use of antibiotics. Few bacterial co-infections were detected in patients who did not have mechanical ventilation, which was consistent with most previous studies [14,26]. However, bacterial diagnostic tests were not performed for all patients, especially those who were not admitted to an ICU, and most patients received antibiotics close to the time of culture collection, which could have reduced the diagnostic sensitivity.",

Recent data from Thailand also showed that oseltamivir therapy was associated with survival in hospitalized patients with influenza pneumonia [37]. Under an Emergency Use Authorization, the FDA recently approved oseltamivir therapy for 2009 H1N1 infection even if it is initiated more than 48 hours after the onset of illness and also approved its use in children under the age of one year [35]. In our study, antiviral drugs were administered to all patients, but such therapy was not initiated within 48 hours of the onset of illness in all patients and there was no difference between surviving patients and those who died in the median number of days from the onset of illness to oseltamivir initiation. Therefore, we were unable to conclude whether or not antiviral therapy in critically ill patients led to better clinical outcomes. No patients undertook the test of the isolated 2009 H1N1 influenza A strains for oseltamivir resistance in our study, so whether oseltamivir resistance affected the outcomes of patients with 2009 H1N1 infection was unclear. Delayed initiation of antiviral therapy may have contributed to an increased severity of illness in our study.",
