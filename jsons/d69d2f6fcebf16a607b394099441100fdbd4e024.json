            "text": "Chronic infection with hepatitis viruses is an enormous global health care concern.' To date, antiviral therapies have been unsuccessful for the majority of chronic hepatitispositive patients, particularly those who are infected perinatally or during infancy. A number of in vitro and in vim preclinical models have demonstrated that RNA drug therapy can effectively inhibit hepatitis viruses and has a different mechanism of action than interferon, thus lending itself to potentially more effective therapeutic intervention than has been previously available. The therapeutic role of RNA drugs is based upon the ways in which double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) acts on cells (FIG. 1) . dsRNA activates the 2',5' oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase/RNase L pathway: which is important in the control of hepatitis virus and other viral infections. The activated 2-5A synthetase produces bioactive 2-5A molecules, which activate RNase L. RNase L destroys hepatitis virus RNAs. The high molecular weight dsRNA (Ampligen\"; poly I p l y C&), can both induce and directly activate 2-5A synthetase, while OragenTM compounds are low molecular weight structural analogues of the bioactive 2-5A. In addition, bioactive 2-5A potentially can inhibit the hepatitis B virus reverse transcriptase (RT). Inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RT has been demonstrated using bioactive 2-5A and specific Oragen compounds. The bioactive 2-5A can also inhibit topoisomerase I activity: which has been associated with hepatitis B virus DNA integration into the genomes of infected hepatocpes5 potentially leading to hepatocellular carcinoma.

Ampligen has been used to treat congenitally infected ducks which have become carriers of the DHBV (Locarnini, manuscript submitted). Pekin-Aylesbuxy crossbred ducklings, with stable and equivalent levels of serum DHBV DNA, were treated with Ampligen (7.5 mg/kg), administered by intraperitoneal injection daily for 28 consecutive days. All treated ducks tolerated the therapeutic regimen. There was no loss of weight or adverse hematologic, liver, or renal function noted. The ducklings treated with Ampligen showed a significant decline in Serum DHBV DNA levels during the first two weeks of treatment, which continued for the following two treatment weeks. After the cessation of treatment at 4 weeks, the serum viral DNA levels returned to pretreatment levels. Viral DNA polymerase levels also showed inhibition, similar to the results seen in the serum DHBV DNA assays. Quantitative dot blot analysis ofliver samples showed an 83 percent decrease in DHBV genome equivalents in Ampligen treated ducklings compared to untreated controls.",

These studies utilized a tissue culture cell line, 2.2.15, derived by transfection of HepG2 human hepatoblastoma cells with a plasmid containing multiple tandem copies of the HBV genome.* A standard antiviral assay using this cell line allows analysis of intracellular HBV replication, extracellular production of HBV virions and toxicity of the test drug to the target cells.9 Intracellular HBV replication was inhibited by five Oragen compounds, in a dose-dependent manner (FIG. 2) . The concentration of the Oragen drugs needed to inhibit 90 percent of the viral replication (EC,) was in the range of approximately 19 to 23 pM. Similarly, the production of extracellular virions was inhibited by these compounds in a dosedependent manner. The ECgO for inhibition of extracellular virions ranged from approximately 15 to 22 pM. We have also recently demonstrated that several Oragen compounds inhibit HBV DNA levels when delivered to 2.2.15 cells in liposomes (unpublished results). Cellular toxicity was not seen in the range of therapeutic activity of the Oragen compounds or at concentrations up to nine-fold greater than those that triggered therapeutic activity.",

At baseline, this patient had signrficant levels of circulating HBV DNA (138 pg/ml). At eight weeks of therapy, the HBV-DNA remained at baseline levels (140 pdml). After the dose escalation, an approximately two-fold decrease (75 pg/ml) was seen at week 17. The SGPT and SGOT, significantly elevated at baseline (SGPT-214 IU/L; SGOT-92 IU/L), decreased approximately twofold by week 8. However, shortly after the Ampligen dose was increased, the enzyme levels increased. This patient continued on therapy at 400 mg twice per week. Additional patients are being enrolled.",
