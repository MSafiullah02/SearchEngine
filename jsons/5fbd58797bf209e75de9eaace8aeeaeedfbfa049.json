It is an acute respiratory illness that is caused by infection with the human SARS corona virus (hSARS-CoV), and probably originates from a wild reservoir. It is a novel corona virus that is related to other previously documented corona viruses, which are largely confined to domestic and other animal species. [1] [2] [3] [4] It has now crossed the species barrier with a new variant form. The spread of this new extremely virulent SARS virus infection in humans led to the first global pandemic of the 21st century, during which over 8000 people became infected and more than 900 died. Intense research led to the complete genome sequence of SARS-CoV within six months of it being reported. [5, 6] As a prevention strategy for SARS infection, attention has been drawn to the development of an effective vaccine for the virus, [7] but it is also necessary to have therapeutic options available for those who have already been infected. Currently, there is no treatment available for this rapidly spreading infection. Normally, patients who have contracted this syndrome are administered common antiviral drugs with minimal or no results, and are kept in isolation or quarantine. Research during the past three years has indicated that among many targets, the fusogenic envelope glycoprotein of SARS-CoV, also called spike (S) pro-tein, is a major target for therapy. [8] [9] [10] Spike protein mediates viral fusion and the delivery of the viral genome into the host cell. Consequently, a S protein-targeted approach, when applied at the initial stage of infection is likely to reduce infection within and beyond the respiratory organs. We recently reported [11] that S protein is proteolytically processed by membranebound furin, a member of mammalian subtilase proprotein convertases (PCs). [12, 13] This cleavage occurs at the RNTR 761 flEV site, [11] and leads to the formation of two mature fragments: Nterminal S1 and C-terminal S2 ( Figure 1) ; each fragment has Human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (hSARS-CoV) is the causative agent for SARS infection. Its surface glycoprotein (spike protein) is considered to be one of the prime targets for SARS therapeutics and intervention because its proteolytic maturation by a host protease is crucial for host-virus fusion. Using intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic (IQF) peptides based on hSARS-CoV spike protein (Abz-755 Glu-Gln-Asp-Arg-Asn-Thr-Arg-Glu-Val-Phe-Ala-Gln 766 -Tyx-NH 2 ) and in vitro studies, we show that besides furin, other PCs, like PC5 and PC7, might also be involved in this cleavage event. Through kinetic measurements with recombinant PCs, we observed that the peptide was cleaved efficiently by both furin and PC5, but very poorly by PC7. The cleavage could be blocked by a PC-inhibitor, a1-PDX, in a dose-dependent manner. Circular dichroism spectra indicated that this peptide possesses a high degree of sheet structure. Following cleavage by furin, the sheet content increased, possibly at the expense of turn and random structures. 1 H NMR spectra from 2D COSY and ROESY experiments under physiological buffer and pH conditions indicated that this peptide possesses a structure with a turn at its C-terminal segment, close to the cleavage site. The data suggest that the cleavable peptide bond is located within the most exposed domain; this is supported by the nearby turn structure. Several strong to weak NMR ROESY correlations were detected, and a 3D structure of the spike IQF peptide that contains the crucial cleavage site R 761 flE has been proposed. distinct biological functions. Following cleavage, S1, the globular part of S protein mediates binding to the host cell-surface receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). [14] A 193amino-acid segment (from residues 318-510) of S protein has been identified as the receptor-binding domain. [15] S2, a more conserved domain, forms the membrane-anchored stalk region and mediates virus-host cell fusion. [16] Ex-vivo studies with FD11 and Vero E6 cells also revealed that two other membrane-bound PCs, namely PC5B and PC7, cleave S protein; but a comparative study of their efficacies was not made either with the membrane-bound or soluble C-terminal-truncated forms. In this regard, more work is needed because these PCs have been implicated in the proteolytic maturation of a large number of other viral glycoproteins that contain a PC-recognition motif at the cleavage site. [17] In this work, we have conducted an in vitro comparative study on the cleavage of hSARS S protein with the soluble forms of furin, PC5, and PC7 by using an intramolecularly quenched model fluorogenic (IQF) peptide that was derived from the S protein cleavage site. We have also investigated the ability of a PC inhibitor to block this cleavage. Moreover, we examined the solutionphase structure of this peptide by using circular dichroism (CD) and 2D 1 H NMR spectroscopy studies, and have found A C H T U N G T R E N N U N G important structural and conformational features of S protein near the crucial activation site. While CD spectroscopy [18] was used to determine the secondary structure of several SARS-CoV-derived peptides under various conditions, [19, 20] NMR data [21] were more useful for determining its solution-phase structure under conditions that mimic a physiological environment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 470, "end": 473, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 474, "end": 477, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 478, "end": 481, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 482, "end": 485, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 852, "end": 855, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 856, "end": 858, "text": "6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 987, "end": 990, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1527, "end": 1530, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1531, "end": 1534, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1535, "end": 1539, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1818, "end": 1822, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1953, "end": 1957, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1958, "end": 1961, "text": "13]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2010, "end": 2014, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3894, "end": 3898, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4012, "end": 4016, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4124, "end": 4128, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4598, "end": 4602, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5246, "end": 5250, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5360, "end": 5364, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 5365, "end": 5368, "text": "20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5378, "end": 5382, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2100, "end": 2109, "text": "Figure 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "A number of IQF peptides based on potential PC cleavage sites of hSARS-CoV spike protein were prepared by using solidphase Fmoc chemistry (see the Experimental Section). The location of these peptides and the various important domains of spike protein, including the heptad repeat and transmembrane domains are shown in Figure 1 by using IQF QSARS-4 as a model peptide. The chemical synthesis of IQF QSARS-4 peptide was carried out with solid-phase Fmoc chemistry and was based on various steps of repetitive Fmoc deprotections and amide couplings by using HATU and DIEA ( Figure S1 A and C). In this peptide, electron transfer takes place from the donor Abz function to the acceptor nitrotyrosine moiety; this leads to the quenching of its fluorescence property (Figure S1 B). The selection of the above peptides was guided primarily by the presence of a PC sequence recognition motif, and sizes of the cleaved bands obtained in coinfection experiments with fulllength hSARS-CoV spike protein and individual full-length PCs. [13] Among all of the IQF peptides tested, only QSARS-4 was found to be cleaved significantly by furin, PC5, and PC7 (vide infra), and therefore this peptide was further subjected to investigation for evaluation of its conformation and secondary structure.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1026, "end": 1030, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 320, "end": 328, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 573, "end": 582, "text": "Figure S1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Selection of SARS-spike peptides"}, {"text": "In vitro digestion of QSARS-4 peptide by furin, PC5, and PC7", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Selection of SARS-spike peptides"}, {"text": "An initial comparative study on the digestion of QSARS-4 peptide by the soluble forms of convertases, furin, PC5 and PC7 was achieved by RP-HPLC analysis of each crude digest. Thus, it was evident that both furin and PC5, which have similar levels of enzyme activity compared to PC7 (as determined by active-site titration with the inhibitor Dec-RVKR-cmk and assay), cleave QSARS-4 peptide efficiently at the correct physiological site (R 761 flE) as confirmed by mass spectra data of the HPLC peaks ( Figure 2 ). Thus, upon cleavage QSARS-4 (Abz-755 Glu-Gln-Asp-Arg-Asn-Thr-Arg-Glu-Val-Phe-Ala-Gln 766 -Tyx-NH 2 ; retention time (t R ) 38.4 min; M w 1818 Da) generated two additional peaks at t R 23.6 and 36.1 min for the N-terminal fragment (NT), Abz-Glu-Gln-Asp-Arg-Asn-Thr-Arg-OH (M w 1036 Da) and the C-terminal fragment (CT), Glu-Val-Phe-Ala-Gln-Tyx-NH 2 (M w 801 Da), respectively. The peak areas that correspond to the NT and CT fragments were significantly higher in furin and PC5 digests compared to PC7 digest. In fact, the intensities of these fragment peaks were very weak in the HPLC chromatogram of the PC7 digest. Based on peak heights or areas, it is estimated that about 18-25 % of the peptide is cleaved by furin and PC5, and only about 1 % is cleaved by PC7 under identical conditions ( Figure 2 , Table 1 ). This amount of cleavage, though small, is still considered to be significant when compared to that observed in other similar systems. [11, 17, 22] Measurements of kinetic parameters, V max , K m , and K cat Michaelis-Menten plots for the determination of V max and K m for the digestion of QSARS-4 peptide by soluble recombinant furin, PC5, and PC7 are shown in Figure 3 . The measured kinetic parameters are presented in Table 1 . The amount of active enzyme (E o ) in each PC sample was determined with active-site titration by using the covalent inhibitor Dec-RVKR-cmk, and by assuming that each PC enzyme was inactivated in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio, as in the case of trypsin by TLCK (tosyl lysine chloromethyl ketone). [23] Our data show that among the three soluble PCs examined, furin was the most potent enzyme in cleaving QSARS-4 at the R 761 flE site in vitro; the measured K cat / K m ratio for furin digestion was 92.4 mm \u00c01 h \u00c01 . This was~2.4 and 24.3-fold better than the corresponding values for PC5 and PC7 digestions, respectively. It was further noted that the lowest K m value was obtained with furin; this suggests a stronger interaction between the substrate and QSARS-4. Moreover, the highest K cat value was obtained for PC5 and the lowest for PC7; this indicated a rapid and slow turnover for the two enzymes, respectively.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1464, "end": 1468, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1469, "end": 1472, "text": "17,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1473, "end": 1476, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2056, "end": 2060, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 502, "end": 510, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1308, "end": 1316, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1319, "end": 1326, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1692, "end": 1700, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1752, "end": 1759, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Selection of SARS-spike peptides"}, {"text": "When QSARS-4 (40 mg) was digested with furin (0.2 U mL \u00c01 ) for 2 h in the presence of increasing amounts of PC inhibitor, a1-PDX, [22] cleavage gradually diminished.

As shown in Figure 5 A, the overall spectral profile did not change significantly with concentration; this suggests that the secondary structure of the peptide remained largely unchanged. As expected, only the peak intensity changed with concentration. Upon software analysis of the CD spectra, it was found that there was no helical structure present in the peptide at the concentrations used.

This occurred mostly at the expense of the random structure, which decreased from~20 to~15 % as the concentration of QSARS-4 decreased from 1 to 0.25 mg mL \u00c01 . In all of our subsequent digestion experiments, the concentration of QSARS-4 peptide was fixed at 1 mg mL \u00c01 because the CD spectra at this concentration were strong enough for a good structural evaluation. Upon digestion of QSARS-4 (1 mg mL \u00c01 ) for 30 min with increasing amounts of furin, the sheet content increased slightly, mainly at the expense of turn structures, and then remained more or less con-stant (Table 2 ). This was also displayed in overlay CD spectra (Figure 5 B) . Even when the incubations were performed for a longer period of time, such as 4 h, not much change was noticed in the CD spectra. Thus, the most significant change occurred immediately following initial contact with furin. Further addition of furin did not seem to alter the CD spectra to any significant extent. The CD spectra shown in Figure 5 A or 5 B were the net spectra that were obtained following the subtraction of the appropriate control spectra. Our data indicate that even after a long period of digestion (4 h), the mixture of undigested QSARS-4 and its cleaved fragments still exhibited a predominantly sheet structure. The presence of a high sheet content in the peptide, as found by the CD studies was not in full agreement with the NMR results (vide infra) possibly because of the differences in the peptide concentrations, and other differing conditions that were used in the two studies (see the Experimental Section).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 176, "end": 184, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 1342, "end": 1350, "text": "(Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 1400, "end": 1412, "text": "(Figure 5 B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 1752, "end": 1760, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Circular dichroism spectra"}, {"text": "The protons of each amino acid were assigned based on analysis of COSY, HSQC, TOCSY, and ROESY spectra. Aromatic protons were assigned based primarily on COSY correlations. Although sometimes there were partial overlaps among individual peptide protons and the protons of the buffer, all amino acid protons could be assigned from their TOCSY patterns. The positions of various a, b, g, d, aromatic and backbone NH amide protons are shown in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information. The amide a-proton of N-terminal glutamic acid (E1) was assigned to 8.56 ppm based on a ROESY correlation between this and the Abz aromatic ortho-proton, to the glutamic acid amide (NH) proton ( Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). Due to the similarity of TOCSY patterns ( Figure S4 in the Supporting Information) for the spin systems that originate from the amide protons at 8.56 and 8.49 ppm, these two amino acids were assigned as glutamic acids E1 and E8, respectively. Analogously, the two-spin systems that originate from the amide protons at 8.19 and 8.05 ppm were assigned as glutamines Q2 and Q12. The two glutamines (Q1 and Q12) and two arginines (R4 and R7) were distinguished based on ROESY correlations between the amide and a-protons of the neighboring amino acids ( Figure S5 in the Supporting Information).

Soluble PC7 also cleaved the peptide, but with very poor efficiency. This was reflected in the very low K cat /K m value for PC7 compared to those for furin and PC5. Interestingly, the K cat and K m values were high for PC5 cleavage compared to furin cleavage, but the overall catalytic efficiency of furin based on the K cat /K m ratio was nearly 2.5-fold better than that for PC5. These in vitro results indicate that PC5 and furin are the major host candidate enzymes involved in QSARS-4 cleavage. In order to further study the kinetics and specificity of the above-described digestions experiments were performed to examine the effect of a PC inhibitor on QSARS-4 peptide cleavage. Our data show that cleavage could be blocked in vitro in a dose-dependent manner by a1-PDX-a known potent furin and PC inhibitor. a1-PDX is a bioengineered variant of a1-antitrypsin (AT) the cleavage sequence for which (AIPM 382 ) was mutated to RIPR 382 to mimic the PC/furin recognition motif. Several studies have demonstrated the ability of a1-PDX to block proteolytic events mediated by PCs, including furin, in both in vitro and in vivo models.

Therefore, PC inhibitors are likely to find important biochemical and therapeutic applications in some of these metabolic conditions. However, further studies with full-length spike protein will be needed to examine its potential application in the study of SARS infection.

It was also demonstrated that the cleavage could be blocked in a dose-dependent manner by a1-PDX. A NMR study under near physiological pH conditions showed the possible presence of a b turn in close proximity to the cleavage site. This type of secondary structure could represent a unique common feature of most viral glycoprotein processing by host PCs. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to demonstrate the presence of a specific secondary structure near the cleavage site by NMR and CD studies. Further studies with other viral glycoproteins will be required to confirm the general applicability of this hypothesis. The concept that SARS intervention might be feasible with PC or furin inhibitors is challenged by several observations that furin cleavage of the glycoprotein of the related Ebola virus is not important for in vitro infectivity and function. [31, 32] This raises questions about the therapeutic potentials of furin inhibitors in SARS infection. [13, 27] For each coupling step an extended cycle (30 min) was used.
