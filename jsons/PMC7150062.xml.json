All of them are multifaceted in nature, while the commonality is that they have long lead times to plan and develop and are costly to build and maintain.",

While this will provide superior growth perspectives to airports in the Asia-Pacific region, the overall outlook is very positive across the board. Regardless of the slightly different projections, volumes will more or less double during the next 20 years. Against this background, IATA is expecting that almost all of the world\u2019s top 100 airports require major infrastructure expansion during this period. Moreover, there could be 100 more slot coordinated airports within 10 years\u2019 time already. That is in addition to the 189 Level 3 and 122 Level 2 airports (with some peak congestion) as of November 2017. All regions are concerned by this challenge, although Europe is in the limelight of this infrastructure shortage (Garcia, Gittens, 2018, Clark et al., 2018). In order to accommodate for this growth scenario, adequate infrastructure is required both in the air and on the ground\u2014substantially beyond current plans to expand capacity. Otherwise, Eurocontrol (2018) is afraid that according to their most likely scenario, there will be around 1.5 million flights more in demand than can be accommodated by 2040, and 166 million passengers will be unable to fly. It also means that the number of airports operating near capacity during most of the day, as it is the case at London Heathrow (LHR), for example, will rise from six in summer 2016 to then sixteen.",

Finally, airports also support attracting and sustaining business development outside of air transport.

The CEM, on the other hand, was only launched in 2014 and is limited to Europe, but includes aircraft operators, air navigation service providers, and trade associations in addition to airport operators. Its objective is to facilitate the already existing activities of these core operational stakeholders by increasing their awareness of the various interdependencies.

Additional comprehensive measures were adopted to address the capacity shortage at Europe\u2019s airports and improve the quality of services offered to passengers under the umbrella of the \u201cBetter Airports Package\u201d (EC, 2011). More recently, the EC (2015) introduced their \u201cNew Aviation Strategy for Europe,\u201d which is supposed to foster innovation and generate growth for European business, while letting passengers benefit from increasing connectivity and safer, cleaner as well as cheaper flights. (Additional aspects of aviation/airport policy will be considered in Feature 5.1.)Feature 1.1Airport products and servicesFrom a commercial perspective, the two main groups of airport users are the airlines, representing the primary customers (B2B) and the travelers or consumers using the dedicated facilities (B2C). For the airlines, airports are instrumental for offering their product by providing the required infrastructure to operate aircraft and service their customers being passengers and cargo shippers. These genuine airline customers are airport users or consumers at the same time. This also holds true for meters and greeters as well as employees. The airline business requires adequate airport access as well as facilities and services at competitive fees and charges, plus a growth perspective for future development.In order to address the airlines\u2019 demand for adequate capacity and facilities to operate their business, airports provide the required infrastructure and offer a range of services. These represent the main sources of their revenue. At most airports aeronautical charges include the categories summarized by Table 1.3\n.Furthermore, a number of airports impose peak charges and/or noise surcharges (or discounts, as applicable), as a constituent of the landing charges. More rarely, additional charges fall due for aircraft emissions and the usage of centralized infrastructure, such as baggage sorters and underground fueling system. Ground handling services are not necessarily provided by the airport operator but frequently by third parties. The latter case will then generate commercial income based on a concession fee paid by the handling agent. Also fuel charges are usually not collected by the airport but levied by the fuel companies. Government taxes bypass the airport operator in general.\nWhile Chapter 3, Measuring the financial position, will give an example of a table of charges and Chapter 10, Regulatory regime, will add pricing aspects, it is worthwhile stating two relevant principles stipulated by ICAO\u2019s (2012) \u201cPolicies on Charges for Airports and Air Navigation Services\u201d: First, the \u201cuser pays principle,\u201d which means to say that users should bear the full and fair cost for the provision of required infrastructure; second, airport charges are essentially cost based (LeighFisher, 2017).The airlines\u2019 customers\u2014the passengers consuming at the airport\u2014have a different perspective. Today\u2019s savvy travelers increasingly expect both air carriers and airports to understand their preferences and provide personalized offers, advice, and guidance for their door-to-door journeys. Empowered consumers will be loyal to those addressing their needs for information, control, and individual service. This, for sure, includes easy access to and processing at the airport for boarding their flight (Ascend, 2014). In order to address this demand, airports provide the required infrastructure and offer a wide range of services and amenities. The latter are frequently provided by third parties instead of the airport operators themselves. For running their businesses on the airport premises, these concessionaires have to pay a percentage fee on their turnover on top of a fixed rental fee. The major services are summarized by Table 1.4\n, representing sources of commercial income for the airport operator generated on the landside, primarily driven by passenger volumes.It needs to be noted that airport employees also make use of several services and contribute to the generation of commercial revenue. The same applies to authorities and airlines renting floor space for operations and back offices, parking facilities, as well as associated utilities. Major characteristics of concession contracts will be introduced in Chapter 3, Measuring the financial position.As with any other business, meeting customer needs and expectations is key to operating an airport successfully. This appears to be mandatory, as Copenhagen Economics (CE, 2012) confirmed by Oxera (2017) found that:\u2022airlines are flexible enough to extensively practice opening and closing of routes (churn), and\u2022consumers have full market transparency using internet-based search engines and a wide range of options, both in terms of flights and airports.\nThese findings apply primarily to small <10 million passengers per annum (mppa) and medium sized airports, while larger ones >40 mppa are affected more by competition for transfer passengers. In general, airports are competing for any additional traffic in terms of passengers and cargo, particularly for:\u2022passengers in a shared local market,\u2022connecting passengers, and\u2022airline services on new and existing routes (Oxera, 2017).\nAlthough the focus of this research was on Europe, it can be concluded from the wide-spread granting of commercial incentives to airlines across regions that airport competition has become a worldwide phenomenon in the meantime. Various enticements have actually developed into a major tool of airport marketing, in addition to putting their products to the shop-window at the different \u201cRoutes Conferences.\u201d Feature 10.1 will discuss the competitive situation in the sector in more detail.\n",
