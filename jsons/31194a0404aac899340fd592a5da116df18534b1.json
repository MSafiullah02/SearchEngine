Our specific goal was to determine whether combinations of both IFNs would produce enhanced antiviral effects that could, indirectly, suggest potential combination IFN therapy strategies for the treatment of SARS-CoV. The effect of combinations of both IFNs against SARS-CoV were analysed by yield reduction assay. Specifically, African green monkey kidney epithelial cells (Vero cells) were seeded into 96-well plates (2 ! 10 4 cells per well) and cultured overnight. Triplicate cell cultures were treated with concentrations (1-100,000 IU/ml) of recombinant IFN-\u2424 (rIFN-\u2424 1a , specific activity 270 MIU/mg; Rebif , Ares-Serono, Basel, Switzerland) or natural IFN-\u2423 (nIFN-\u2423 , leukocyte IFN, specific activity 200 MIU/mg; Alfaferone , Alfa-Wasserman, Bologna, Italy), either alone or in combination with rIFN-\u2425 (specific activity 20 MIU/mg; Imukin , Boehringer Ingelheim, Reggello-Firenze, Italy) 24 h before infection with SARS-CoV [multiplicity of infection = 0.1 TCID 50 /cell (50% tissue culture infectious dose)]. Infection with SARS-CoV (HSR1 strain) [13] was allowed to develop for 72 h, depending on the time required for specific cytopathic effects to become clearly visible by optical microscopy [10, 13] . Culture supernatants were then collected and titration of SARS-CoV was performed in Vero cells by determination of the TCID 50 using the method of Reed and Muench [14] .",

Values of 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) ranged from 400 IU/m (IFN-\u2424 ) to 3,700 IU/ml (IFN-\u2423 ). However, when different concentrations of IFN-\u2423 or -\u2424 were used in combination with different concentrations of IFN-\u2425 , inhibition of the virus yield was more pronounced. Indeed, the IC 50 values decreased markedly when the different IFNs were used in combination. Specifically, the IC 50 values for SARS-CoV yield for IFN-\u2423 in combination with IFN-\u2425 were up to 1.2 and 3.6 log fold lower compared with the IC 50 value for treatment with IFN-\u2423 alone. The IC 50 values for IFN-\u2425 showed a 1.0-2.5 log fold decrease when used in combination with IFN-\u2423 relative to the value recorded for IFN-\u2425 alone.

Experimental combination therapy data points plotted well below the expected additive line at each viral yield reduction value for type I IFN (IFN-\u2423 or -\u2424 ) plus IFN-\u2425 combinations, indicating a strong synergism across a broad range of doses (data not shown).

Hence, in order to discover a possible mechanism responsible for the observed synergism between type I and II IFNs, we examined the expression of two other well-known IFN-inducible proteins: 2 -5 -oligoadenylate synthetase [17] and p56 (also known as IFIT1) [18] . The mRNA copy content of their genes was measured in untreated versus IFN-treated Vero cells by a real-time 5 -exonuclease reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (TaqMan ) assay using the ABI 7700 sequence detector (Applied Biosys- tems, Monza, Italy). Briefly, total cellular RNA was extracted from 5 ! 10 6 Vero cells using phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate reagent (Trizol , Gibco BRL, Grand Island, N.Y., USA), following the manufacturer's instructions, and was transcribed using the High-Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems).

Such a possibility should be addressed by performing further and more focused studies; at present, no definite conclusions can be drawn on the mechanism underlying the strong synergism recorded here.",

It should be emphasised that our in vitro study has thus far been performed only in Vero cells. We were unable to obtain viral progeny from other human cell lines, including Caco and Huh7, employed by others [5, 22, 23] ; thus, we were unable to assess the activity of the various IFNs in a proper human system. Further, no firm conclusions or extrapolations can be drawn from the IFN inhibitory concentration values obtained with regard to potential therapeutic concentrations of IFNs that might be expected to be required in a clinical situation. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that further investigation may be warranted to determine the role of IFN-\u2423 or -\u2424 plus IFN-\u2425 as a therapeutic strategy in the treatment of SARS-CoV infections.",
