Recent work has highlighted that, while typically an acute infection in the population, immunocompromised patients often experience long-term infections that may last many years. This cohort of patients and those regularly exposed to infectious material, for example, care workers and others, would benefit greatly from the development of a vaccine or antiviral therapy. While a licensed vaccine or antiviral has yet to be developed, work over the past 10 years in this area has intensified and trials with a vaccine candidate have proven promising. Numerous antiviral targets and small molecule inhibitors that have efficacy in cell culture have now been identified; however, further studies in this area are required in order to make these suitable for clinical use.",

This is at least partly due to better surveillance mechanisms, improving our understanding of the disease burden, but also due to the availability of assays to study the development of the immune response and the efficacy of small molecule inhibitors. While the efficient culture of human noroviruses (HuNoVs) in immortalized cells has yet to be achieved [5] , the development of a norovirus replicon [6] , which allows the generation of cell lines stably replicating Norwalk virus RNA, has facilitated many small molecule inhibitors to be tested in vitro. The discovery of murine norovirus (MNV) [7] , which replicates efficiently in immortalized macrophage cells and has both reverse genetics systems and small animal models available [8] , has also enabled the examination of the immune responses to noroviruses as well as the efficacy of inhibitors in vitro and in vivo.",

            "text": "HuNoVs are one of the major causes of foodborne gastroenteritis [1] . Norovirus outbreaks are frequently associated with bivalve shellfish, such as oysters, or with freshly prepared produce such as salads or fruit, generally due to contamination of water with infected fecal matter, or from an infected food handler [10] . Oysters are particularly problematic as they are often eaten raw, and they filter and trap large numbers of particles, serving to concentrate viruses. Outbreaks from contaminated oysters display distinct seasonality and, as such are amenable to testing, detection and forecasting measures [11] . In terms of decontamination methods, high-pressure inactivation (600 MPa) has shown to effectively neutralize infectivity in oysters seeded with HuNoV in volunteer studies, with the added advantage of not involving chemical treatment of the food [12] . Other methods including \u03b3irradiation, thermal inactivation, steam-ultrasound, UV radiation, chloride or ozone disinfection, and electron beam irradiation have also been tested with varying degrees of success [12] . However, the vast majority of such studies are conducted with norovirus surrogates such as feline calicivirus or MNV, as testing decontamination procedures for HuNoV is difficult owing to the lack of an available cell culture system to detect any remaining infectivity. they often have limited efficacy against noroviruses with some reports suggesting that their use is in fact a risk factor for norovirus outbreaks in hospitals, although this is currently controversial [1] . Simple mechanical removal of the virus through adherence to proper hand washing techniques appears most effective with the additional incorporation of alcoholbased sanitizers into a hand washing protocol offering minor improvements [14] .",

For instance, infection in volunteers with Norwalk virus resulted in a lack of long-term protection against reinfection, suggesting that the immune system is unable to generate a durable response. In addition, given the substantial norovirus strain diversity, it may be difficult to generate a broadly crossreactive vaccine capable of protecting against all norovirus strains.

Large-scale systems for the preparation of HuNoV VLPs have been developed, including expression in plants such as tobacco and potato, VLPs from which are immunogenic in mice [25] .",

High levels of specific IgA antibodies against HuNoV were detected, further supporting this route of inoculation to induce a robust mucosal protection. The advantages of an approach based on intranasal delivery are its ease of administration and the stimulation of mucosal dendritic cells facilitating a local immune response [27] . In fact, a strong mucosal IgA response in gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts has been associated to increased protection against HuNoV [28] . Studies involving an intramuscular route of vaccination in chimpanzees have also provided positive results for norovirus vaccination. Animals inoculated with Norwalk virus VLPs (GI), were protected against subsequent challenge with Norwalk virus, while animals vaccinated with VLPs from a GII norovirus were not [29] . These results highlight the need for the development of efficient bivalent and broadly cross-reactive vaccines.",

            "text": "HuNoV interacts with HBGAs and, although binding to HBGA is not sufficient to enter cultured cells, it is thought that this interaction is critical for virus internalization and subsequent infection [9, 19] . HBGAs are complex carbo hydrate molecules present in the surface of red blood cells, mucosal epithelia and also in different body fluids (i.e., milk and saliva). HuNoV capsids interact with different families of HBGAs including ABO, secretor and \u03b12,3-sialylated carbohydrates of the type 2 chain (e.g., sialyl-Lewis X). Individuals harboring a single polymorphism in the FUT2 gene are less susceptible to HuNoV infection, further supporting the hypothesis that HBGAs are the receptor molecules for HuNoV [9, 19] . The FUT2 gene encodes for a \u03b11,2-fucosyl transferase that catalyzes the fucosylation of HBGAs and is responsible for the secretor blood type [19] . Nonsecretor individuals present a polymorphism in the FUT2 gene resulting in an enzyme unable to fucosylate H-type backbones in HBGAs. Although the interaction with HBGA is required for virus entry, it is thought that other cellular cofactors are required as overexpression of FUT2 does not rescue infectivity in cells that are competent for HuNoV replication [30] . Recent investigations suggest that HuNoV binding to cells and internalization in vivo can also occur independently of HBGA, suggesting the participation of other receptor molecules [31] . In particular, it has been demonstrated that HuNoV capsids interact with heparan sulphate, a cell membrane glycosaminoglycan, which might have a role in cell entry [32] . By contrast, MNV uses the ganglioside GD1a as an attachment ligand for infection of permissive cells, although the relevance of this molecule for HuNoV has yet to be determined [33] .",

These include NS7 pol , the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) responsible for viral RNA synthesis, as well as NS6 pro , the viral protease that catalyzes the proteolytic processing of ORF1. Translation of structural proteins VP1 (ORF2) and VP2 (ORF3) occurs from a subgenomic RNA produced during virus replication ( Figure 2 ). The process of viral protein translation in noroviruses relies on the recruitment of eukaryotic translation initiation factors to the virus encoded VPg protein (NS5) covalently linked to the 5\u2032 end of the viral RNA.

The identification of novel antiviral compounds targeting the capsid has also been attempted with a novel approach based on library screening, x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance [42] . This method has been instrumental in the identification of two new antiviral candidates with high affinity for the fucose binding pocket of Norwalk virus. Standard screening studies involving >5000 synthetic small molecules and enzyme immune assay have also been applied successfully with 14 different compounds identified to effectively inhibit HuNoV capsid binding to at least one of the members of the HBGA ABO family [43] . Since HuNoV capsid binds heparan sulphate, another possible field of investigation would be the use of heparan sulphate analogs such as heparin, suramin and other heparan derivatives [32] . The observation that suramin also targets the viral polymerase (discussed later), further supports its use as a potential therapeutic approach.",

The use of Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts specific drugs aimed to disrupt these interfaces could provide an attractive antiviral therapy.

Peptide-conjugated PMOs (PPMOs) directed against the first AUG region in norovirus ORF1 gene are effective in inhibiting HuNoV and MNV replication in cell culture [49] . PMOs are similar to DNA oligonucleotides, but they are soluble in water and highly resistant to degradation making them suitable for treatments in vivo. The use of siRNA molecules to target replication is more efficient than PPMOs; PPMOs and siRNAs targeting the equivalent genomic sequence in FCV showed that siRNA elicited inhibition 50-fold larger than PPMOs [50] .

This guanylated-VPg product is then used as a primer for viral RNA synthesis. Accordingly, it may be possible to design specific nucleoside analogs to compete with GTP to inhibit VPg-nucleotydylylation, or to be incorporated but prevent the subsequent elongation of viral RNA synthesis. For example, in picornaviruses, 5-fluorouracil triphosphate functions as an inhibitor of VPg-primed RNA synthesis [56] . The 5-fluorouracil triphosphate is bound to VPg with higher affinity than uridine 5\u2032-triphosphate, the natural nucleotide typically incorporated, and this binding inhibits the formation of long VPg-primed RNA polymers, suggesting that its antiviral activity is partly due to the blocking of viral RNA synthesis initiation [56] .",

Several nucleoside compounds have activity against noroviruses in cell culture, opening up their possible application as therapeutic compounds. RBV, a purine analog that has been found to possess antiviral activity against a vast number of different viruses [57] , also works against HuNoV and MNV in cell culture [52] . RBV is phosphorylated by cellular enzymes into RBV mono-, di-and tri-phosphate and exerts its broad antiviral effect through various mechanisms: competitive inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, which reduces the intracellular concentrations of guanine nucleotides; inhibition of viral RNAdependent RNA polymerases; inhibition of mRNA cap formation; enhancement of antiviral immune responses; and lethal mutagenesis of viral quasi species as a result of incorporation of RBV monophosphate into viral RNA (reviewed in [57] ). For MNV and the novovirus replicon, RBV antiviral activity is associated with a decrease in GTP levels since the complementation with GTP reduces its antiviral activity.

In noroviruses the untranslated regions are extremely short but the coding and noncoding regions in genomic and subgenomic RNA are known to fold into highly-ordered secondary structures that interact with multiple host factors including proteins La, PTB, PCBP, DDX3 and various hnRNPs among others [70, 71] . Although the precise role of these proteins in the norovirus life cycle is yet to be determined, they are probably involved in viral RNA replication and genome circularization, a process that is thought to be required for many RNA viruses [72] . So far, no antinorovirus strategies have been investigated based on targeting these proteins, but as small molecule inhibitors exist for some of them, further studies in this area are warranted. For example, the identification of small inhibitory molecules targeting DDX3 has opened the possibility of targeting norovirus infections in vivo as specific downregulation of DDX3 protein levels in cells results in the inhibition of MNV [71] . Supporting this possibility, DDX3 inhibitors have shown antiviral activity against HIV in cell culture [73] . DDX3 is a multifunctional host cell RNA helicase Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts implicated in the life cycle of a number of viruses [74] .

As with all therapies targeting intestinal pathogens, there is a significant problem associated with the delivery of the inhibitor to the site of replication, as well as stability in this rather harsh environment. Subsequently, there are a number of significant hurdles that must be overcome for the use of these inhibitors in a clinical setting. An area that has yet to be fully explored is the use of inhibitors that are currently in clinical use for other RNA viruses. RBV is widely used for the treatment of viral infections and has been shown to be effective in cell culture against HuNoV, yet clinical use in the treatment of chronic norovirus infections has yet to be described. Given the conserved nature of RNA synthesis, the viral RNA polymerase provides a particularly attractive target as numerous nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors are under trial for other RNA viruses such as HCV.

A better understanding of the correlates of protection would also enable better vaccine design and could lead to the generation of a broadly protective vaccine that may at least produce short-term immunity in particularly vulnerable or regularly exposed individuals. Until such a time, the use of effective quarantine and hygiene measures remain the only alternative for the control of norovirus outbreaks and provide a way of minimizing the impact of these important pathogens.",

Open reading frame 1 is subdivided into different segments corresponding to the different nonstructural proteins released after proteolysis: NS1/2, NTPase (NS3), NS4, VPg (NS5), protease (NS6pro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS7 pol ). Host factors identified to bind to the viral genome extremities are represented as different green shapes. Host factors interacting with viral proteins are represented as different orange shapes. Asterisks highlight host factors for which small molecule inhibitors are available, and their inhibition by these drugs, or downregulation by RNAi, result in decreased norovirus replication. Note that the components shown to interact with the viral RNA genome may interact indirectly via an intermediate protein or proteins.

            "text": "The norovirus infectious particle interacts with HBGA and HS expressed on the cell surface. The attached virion is then internalized and disassembled, leading to the release of the viral genome in the cytoplasm. VPg covalently attached to the 5\u2032 end of the viral genome recruits different HFs, including components of eIF3 and eIF4F, required for cap-independent protein translation, permitting the expression of ORF1. ORF1 is proteolytically cleaved by the viral protease NS6 pro (and its precursors). Mature nonstructural proteins released after proteolysis promote the replication of the viral RNA; VPg acts as primer of viral RNA synthesis, remaining covalently attached to the viral genome after replication; the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS7 pol catalyze the synthesis of viral RNA in a process assisted by the helicase-homologous viral NTPase (NS3). The binding of several host factors (HFs) such as La protein, DDX3, hnRNP A1 and PTB to the viral genome is critical for the efficient virus replication. The replication of a subgenomic RNA leads to the generation of shorter viral RNA products that are translated in the major and minor capsid proteins VP1 and VP2 (ORF2 and ORF3, respectively). Newly synthesized genomes are encapsidated in mature particles that are released into the extracellular environment. HBGA: Histo blood group antigen; HF: Host factor; HS: Heparan sulfate; ORF: Open reading frame. ",
