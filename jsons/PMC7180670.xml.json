            "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared rapid infection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) across the globe as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Although the main mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is predominantly respiratory, several studies have suggested that exposure of unprotected eyes to the virus may also cause novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) [1, 2]. In agreement, a recent animal study also confirmed that macaque\u2019s conjunctiva inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 lead to the development of mild interstitial pneumonia [3], implying that ocular tissues and fluid may be a potential alternative mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. So far, there have been varying reports regarding the prevalence of ocular manifestations among COVID-19-infected patients [2, 4\u20139]. Hence, in order to summarize the current evidence, a meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the prevalence of ocular manifestations among COVID-19-infected patients. In addition, the diagnostic value of ocular tissue/fluid in detecting SARS-CoV-2 was also evaluated.",

Criteria of studies included in this meta-analysis were (1) observational studies that reported ocular symptoms among COVID-19-infected patients and (2) comparing diagnostic outcomes between ocular tissue and fluid (conjunctival swab/tears) and nasopharyngeal swab or sputum in detecting SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Seven studies were included in this meta-analysis [2, 4\u20139]. Prevalence estimates of ocular manifestations were calculated from six studies [2, 4, 5, 7\u20139] (Table 1). Heterogeneity was evaluated with the I2 statistic, in which an I2 value over 50% was considered an indicator of substantial heterogeneity. If heterogeneity existed, the random-effects model was then used; otherwise, the fixed-effects model was applied. A funnel plot and Begg\u2019s test were used to investigate the publication bias if the pooled effect size consisted of 10 or more studies. The value of 0.05 was indicative of the statistical significance.",

Interestingly, it seems that the ophthalmic manifestations appear to be associated with the disease severity of COVID-19 [5, 8]. And although ocular tissue/fluid is useable for SARS-CoV-2 detection, the procedure may not be useful for diagnostic purposes in the clinical setting. Despite the findings, ocular transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains a crucial issue that requires vigilance of protecting the ocular surface and by wearing protective equipment during ophthalmic examination and handling of ocular fluids by the physician or health care worker.",
