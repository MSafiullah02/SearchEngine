Auranofin treatment 5 dramatically reduced the expression of SARS-COV-2-induced cytokines in human 6 cells. These data indicate that auranofin could be a useful drug to limit SARS-CoV-2 7 infection and associated lung injury due to its antiviral, anti-inflammatory and anti- Gold-based compounds have shown promising activity against a wide range of 1 clinical conditions and microorganism infections. Auranofin, a gold-containing triethyl 2 phosphine, is an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis since 3 1985 (1). It has been investigated for potential therapeutic application in a number of 4 other diseases including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, HIV/AIDS, parasitic 5 infections and bacterial infections (1, 2). Auranofin was approved by FDA for phase II 6 clinical trials for cancer therapy (3-5). Oral auranofin was effective in rodent models 7 of various parasitic infections (6, 7).

Figure 2 20 represents the EC 50 values of auranofin treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infected 21 Huh7 cells. Auranofin inhibited virus replication in the infected cells at EC 50 of 22 approximately 1.4 \u00b5M. It is important to note that in this study, we used 20 to 100-23 times more virus dose (MOI of 1) to infect the cells compared to the recently published reports on anti-viral activities of chloroquine, Auranofin inhibits replication of SARS-COV-2 in human cells. at 24 and 48 hours after infection and viral RNA levels were measured by RT-4 PCR using primers and probe targeting the SARS-COV-2 N1 gene and the SARS-COV-2 N2 5 gene. The cellular RNA extracted from infected cells was quantified, normalized and viral 6 RNA levels per ug of total cellular RNA were calculated. The results were identical for both 7 set of primers showing dramatic reduction in viral RNA at both 24 and 48 hours. SARS-COV-8 2 infectivity titers were measured in cell culture supernatants at 48 hours after infection by 9 plaque assay. Data represent the mean\u00b1SEM, representing two independent experiments",

SARS-COV-2 infection induces a strong 12 up-regulation of IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1 and NF-kB in Huh7 cells (Figure 3). Treatment 13 with auranofin dramatically reduced the expression of SARS-COV-2-induced 14 cytokines in Huh7 cells. SARS-COV-2 infection resulted in a 200-fold increase in the 15 mRNA expression of IL-6 at 48 hours after infection compared to corresponding 16 mock-infected cells. In contrast, there was only a 2-fold increase in expression of IL-17 6 in auranofin-treated cells. TNF-\u03b1 levels increased by 90-fold in the DMSO-treated 18 cells at 48 hours after infection, but this increase was absent in the auranofin-treated 19 cells. Similarly, no increase in the expression of IL-1\u03b2 and NF-kB was observed in 20 the auranofin-treated cells. Auranofin treatment dramatically reduced the expression of SARS-COV-2-2 induced cytokines in human cells: mRNA levels of IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1 and NF-kB were 3 determined using qRT-PCR at 24 and 48 hours after infection.
