            "text": "Several types of experiment in animals give credence to the idea that the level of human ACE2 expression may perhaps be important in COVID-19 infection. Knockout mice genetically modified to have no ACE2 are totally resistant to coronavirus infections [6]. There is a converse to this. In two studies, transgenic mice were bred to overexpress human ACE2 [7,8]. These hACE2 transgenic mice demonstrated markedly increased infectivity and lethality when exposed to SARS coronavirus. Despite this type of evidence, it is commonly said that with ARB and ACE-inhibitor dosing in humans, the induction of ACE2 would be insufficient to matter, and anyway, may not be in the lungs. But this criticism can be discounted applying a body of relevant evidence, both experimental and clinical (described in more detail below), deriving from studies in which ARB and ACE-inhibitor dosing has been used to replenish ACE2 in the lungs in lung failure syndromes resulting from influenza virus, acid inhalation and other noxious influences [6,9\u201311]. Pulmonary ACE2 expression is demonstrably increased by renin-angiotensin block in this context, with strong evidence that it improves survival [6,9\u201311]. In short, the drugs in question for our hypothesis do induce increased pulmonary ACE2 expression, which has biological benefit in noncoronavirus ARSD. With coronavirus exposure it is plausible to ask, as we do, whether the biological effect of drug-induced pulmonary ACE2 expression may be deleterious, promoting infectivity and lethality.",

In our hypothesis [1], we were circumscribed and specific, focusing on ARBs and hypertension. C\u00fcre and Cumhur C\u00fcre demonstrate that there may be a need to think more broadly on this matter. He has extended the issue to prescribing of statins and antidiabetics. How these drugs increase ACE2 expression is unclear. For other drugs that influence ACE2 expression, their action on body sodium balance appears to be a common link, with sodium depletion elevating ACE2. ARBs, and less consistently ACE-inhibitors, increase ACE2 expression, and decrease body sodium content [1]. Aldosterone reduces ACE2 expression [15], mineralocorticoid block with spironolactone increases expression [16]. We suggested [1] that elevated plasma angiotensin, a substrate of ACE2, which is elevated by ARBs and accompanies sodium depletion in general, may regulate the expression of the linked enzyme, ACE2. Things turn out not to be as simple as that, which may partly explain why ACE-inhibition, which reduces body sodium, but through a direct action lowers plasma angiotensin, elevates ACE2 less consistently than ARBs. Much as for aldosterone dosing, dietary sodium loading reduces ACE2 expression [17]. This effect of sodium ingestion is relevant to the use of proximal small intestine tissue, accessed by endoscopic biopsy, used in direct studies of human ACE2 [18]. Direct exposure of the duodenum to sodium in a meal could be a confounder.",

A special form of this pulmonary ACE2 depletion is seen with coronavirus infections, wherein after the virus binds to the ACE2 protein both are internalized, depleting membrane ACE2 [6]. Depletion of ACE2 is accompanied by accumulation of angiotensin, its substrate, in the lung, with adverse effects. The plasma concentration of angiotensin does rise substantially in severe COVID-19 infections [19]. There is a body of experimental and clinical evidence, mentioned above, that renin-angiotensin block, by repleting ACE2, is beneficial in noncoronavirus ARDS, caused by influenza viruses, acid inhalation and other noxious influences [6,9\u201311]. Could this benefit extend to COVID-19 infection?
