While some, but not all, laboratory findings appear similar to sepsis-associated disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), COVID-19-induced coagulopathy (CIC) appears to be more prothrombotic than hemorrhagic. It has been postulated that CIC may be an uncontrolled immunothrombotic response to COVID-19, and there is growing evidence of venous and arterial thromboembolic events in these critically ill patients. Clinicians around the globe are challenged with rapidly identifying reasonable diagnostic, monitoring and anticoagulant strategies to safely and effectively manage these patients. Thoughtful use of proven, evidence-based approaches must be carefully balanced with integration of rapidly emerging evidence and growing experience. The goal of this document is to provide guidance from the Anticoagulation Forum, a North American organization of anticoagulation providers, regarding use of anticoagulant therapies in patients with COVID-19. We discuss in-hospital and post-discharge venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention, treatment of suspected but unconfirmed VTE, laboratory monitoring of COVID-19, associated anticoagulant therapies, and essential elements for optimized transitions of care specific to patients with COVID-19.",

These patients may have additional clinical risk factors for VTE, such as advanced age (e.g., > 65 years), cancer, obesity, pregnancy, congestive heart failure, or history of prior VTE. Most, if not all, would qualify for in-hospital VTE prophylaxis according to existing evidence-based guidelines [1] [2] [3] . As COVID-19 itself may be associated with a prothrombotic state [4] [5] [6] , VTE prophylaxis is of utmost importance. Additionally, more severely ill patients with COVID-19 who are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) may have severe mobility limitations as a result of being intubated, sedated, paralyzed, and potentially placed in a prone position. An early study out of the Hubei Province in China [7] suggests that in the absence of VTE prophylaxis, 25% of COVID-19 patients developed lower extremity DVT as assessed by surveillance doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities, which is higher than the 5-15% incidence seen in placebo arms of early studies of VTE prevention in medically ill hospitalized patients [8] [9] [10] . In these early studies, use of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis reduced the incidence of VTE by up to 60% without an increase in major bleeding. A second study from the Netherlands found pulmonary embolism (PE) in 25 of 184 ICU patients with COVID-19 (13.6%), 72% of which were in central, lobar, or segmental pulmonary arteries, which occurred despite standard dose pharmacologic prophylaxis [11] . A third study from Italy identified thromboembolic events (venous and arterial) in 7.7% of patients admitted with COVID-19, estimating a cumulative rate of 21% [12] . While each of these studies are limited in their design, data collection, and/or statistical methodology, the importance of VTE prophylaxis cannot be understated for hospitalized patients with this illness.",

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, all published studies regarding VTE prophylaxis in patients with COVID-19 have been conducted in adult critically ill patients. Thus, there is no evidence to suggest that approaches other than standard regimens recommended in existing VTE prevention guidelines are indicated for non-critically ill patients. In the study by Klok et al. [11] conducted among critically ill patients with COVID-19 in three ICUs across the Netherlands, the investigators found 25 symptomatic VTE events in 184 adult patients, all of whom received pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis. It should be noted that 2 of the 3 ICUs initially used lower than standard doses of low molecular weight heparin, and the doses were increased over time. Age and coagulopathy were independent predictors of thrombotic complications. This study suggests that critically ill adult COVID-19 patients may develop VTE with standard pharmacologic prophylaxis. A study of 150 patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from 4 ICUs in France receiving prophylactic (80%) or empiric treatment dose (20%) anticoagulation found 16.7% of patients suffered pulmonary embolism (PE) despite this therapy [17] . This represents nearly a sixfold increase in PE compared to patients with ARDS not related to COVID-19. Indirect evidence from other populations, such as bariatric surgery, trauma, and critical illness associated with H1N1 influenza, suggests intensified prophylaxis regimens (either subcutaneous or low-intensity infusion) may be safe and effective if reasonably applied to critically ill patients with COVID-19 [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . At this time there is no evidence for use of biomarkers such as D-dimer to guide intensification of anticoagulant dosing despite it being a marker of poor prognosis [23] . However, it is important for providers and clinicians to stay apprised of emerging evidence and adjust practices accordingly.",

Dose adjustments for renal function or extremes of weight should follow product labeling and/ or institutional protocols. (b) For critically ill patients (i.e., in an ICU) with confirmed or highly suspected COVID-19, we suggest increased doses of VTE prophylaxis (e.g., enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneous twice daily, enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg subcutaneous twice daily, heparin 7500 units subcutaneous three times daily, or low-intensity heparin infusion [22, 24] ). This suggestion is based largely on expert opinion. Dose adjustments for renal function or extremes of weight should follow product labeling and/or institutional protocols. Individual hospitals should determine which regimens best align with institutional experience and workflow. Several examples of institutional protocols for COVID-19 are available for review and use within the Anticoagulation Forum's Centers of Excellence Resources Center (https ://acfor um-excel lence .org/Resou rce-Cente r/index .php). (c) For pregnant patients with confirmed or highly suspected COVID-19, we recommend that providers collaborate closely with obstetric and anesthesia colleagues to determine optimal VTE prophylaxis dosing. Intermediate dosing regimens often used in the third trimester, as suggested by the American college of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) [25] and RCOG [26] , may be a reasonable option for pregnant patients with COVID-19. (d) We recommend against using biomarker thresholds, such as elevated D-dimer, as the sole reason to trigger escalations in anticoagulant dosing outside the setting of a clinical trial. (e) For patients that are improving and transferring out of the ICU to the medical ward, it is reasonable to deescalate to standard VTE prophylaxis dosing.",

Despite two FDA-approved agents for this indication (betrixaban, rivaroxaban) [29, 30] , extending VTE prophylaxis beyond hospital discharge has not been widely adopted due to logistical challenges with implementation, bleeding risk, and large numbers needed to treat to prevent a single VTE event. There is no direct evidence for extended VTE prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients to inform this question. Severely ill patients with COVID-19 may experience prolonged hospital stay, significant deconditioning, and the post-ICU syndrome which greatly limits or delays full recovery to baseline mobility or health status by time of discharge. In addition, patients with COVID-19 may be discharged early in their recovery while they remain quite ill in order to free up hospital beds for sicker patients, particularly in regions hardhit by the pandemic.",

This significantly limits the role of delayed imaging to determine if continued empiric anticoagulation is appropriate for patients who were treated empirically.

This approach can be considered for select patients without changes in warfarin dosing for three or more months. Patient self-testing PST could also be considered for suitable patients and would allow for more frequent testing without increasing the risk of exposure. Candidates for PST should have adequate vision and dexterity to accurately perform the test. Patients with antiphospholipid antibodies and those with conditions resulting in chronically high (i.e. > 55%) or low (i.e. < 30%) hematocrit levels may not have reliable fingerstick INR test results. Finally, several anticoagulation clinics have established drive-up fingerstick INR monitoring so patients do not need to enter the clinic. Anticoagulation clinics already employing fingerstick INR testing are particularly well-positioned for drive-up INR testing.",
