A reasonable recommendation is that, when immunohistochemistry is deemed necessary, at least one antibody each for squamous and glandular differentiation, but no more than two antibodies, should be used for an initial workup (e.g., TTF1 and p40 or p63). Thus a limited panel of TTF1 and p40 (or p63) is suggested for subtyping the tumor to preserve tissue for molecular testing.",

Both quality (degree of atypia) and quantity (groups of atypical cells) need to be considered. In a typical case of ADC with a lepidic growth pattern, the smears tend to be very cellular, containing many groups of atypical epithelial cells. In contrast, in a reactive condition, such as pulmonary infarction, atypical reactive pneumocytes are usually less numerous. \u2022 In mucinous ADC with a lepidic growth pattern, the neoplastic epithelial cells may mimic pulmonary macrophages. Features such as a mucinous background, cytoplasmic mucin/vacuoles, eccentrically located nuclei, and more abundant cytoplasm are helpful in reaching a correct diagnosis. \u2022 Basaloid squamous cell carcinoma may mimic small cell carcinoma; therefore, cellblock preparation in conjunction with immunostains will be helpful. \u2022 Infection such as aspergillosis may result in squamous cells with significant cytological atypia; therefore, infectious etiologies should be excluded before a diagnosis of well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma is rendered. \u2022 A lesion from the mediastinum should be considered if cytological features do not fit the description of a typical \"lung lesion.\" \u2022 Thymoma is rare in young patients and children. In lymphocyte-dominant thymoma, the main component of the aspirate may contain cortical thymocytes with expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and cluster of differentiation (CD)99; therefore, caution should be taken to avoid misdiagnosing it as a lymphoblastic lymphoma. \u2022 Thymic neuroendocrine neoplasm may mimic an epithelial-dominant thymoma; therefore, immunohistochemistry should be performed in cases with equivocal features.",

SARS-CoV belongs to a family of large, positive, single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses. The key pathologic finding is diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Depending on different phases in the disease progression, the composition of inflammatory cells may vary; however, macrophages (including multinucleated forms) and lymphocytes usually predominate. Other pathologic findings, such as fibrosis, prominent vascular injury, hemophagocytosis, squamous metaplasia, apoptosis, and atypical pneumocytes, including multinucleated giant pneumocytes with irregularly distributed nuclei or pneumocytes with large atypical nuclei, prominent eosinophilic nucleoli, and granular amphophilic cytoplasm, were reported. Ancillary tests, such as in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, viral isolation, or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), are necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

Representative images are illustrated in Fig. 6 .39e-h. The overall findings are those of a metastatic spindle cell melanoma. The diagnosis of metastatic spindle cell melanoma can be challenging on FNA specimens. The spindled tumor cells can display a wide range of morphologies, from deceptively bland-appearing reactive fibroblastlike cells to highly pleomorphic, high-grade sarcomatous spindle cells. The diagnostic cytological features of conventional melanoma, such as a dispersed single cell pattern, eccentric nuclei, cytoplasmic melanin pigments, intranuclear pseudoinclusions, prominent macronucleoli, and bi-or multinucleations, are often subtle or even lacking. For the index case, the presence of melanin pigments is a valuable clue to raise the suspicion for melanoma which, in conjunction with the immunophenotype, justified the diagnosis of spindle cell melanoma. The presence of cytoplasmic melanin (continued) Immunohistochemistry plays a critical role in the diagnosis of spindle cell melanoma, especially in the clinical scenario of metastasis. Metastatic spindle cell melanomas tend to lose expression of some melanoma markers. Piao and colleagues reported that spindle cell melanomas express S100, HMB45, and MART1 in 67%, 50%, and 18% of cases, respectively. Although the sensitivity of S100 for melanoma in general is very high (~93-100%), its specificity is low. The expression of S100 can be seen in a variety of tumors. HMB45 is expressed in melanocytic tumors, also in clear cell sarcomas, perivascular epithelial cell tumors (PEComas), melanocytic schwannomas, meningeal melanocytomas, some ovarian steroid tumors, and renal cell carcinomas with the t(6;11)(p29;q12) translocation. The sensitivity of HMB45 for melanoma in general is in the range of 70-90%, but only 0-30% for desmoplastic melanomas. MART1 has a sensitivity of ~85-97% for primary and ~57-92% for metastatic melanomas, but only 0-33% for desmoplastic melanomas; its specificity for melanoma is 95-100%. MART1 expression is also seen in PEComas and clear cell sarcomas.",

Among those, multilayered papillary fragments and cercariform cells are the most helpful features in the distinction of urothelial carcinoma from others. The cercariform cells, first described in 1993 by Johnson and Kini and further defined in 1995 by Powers and Elbadawi, are fusiform, pyramidal, or racket-like cells with eccentric nuclei that form non-tapering, flattened, bulbous, or fishtail-like cytoplasmic extensions in varying lengths. The presence of a small vacuole in the bulbous tail was also a helpful criterion. These cells, which are encountered in 57-100% of metastatic urothelial carcinomas, are interpreted in favor of urothelial carcinoma, particularly when they are observed in large numbers. However, they are not specific and must be considered alongside other clinical and morphological characteristics and immunohistochemical phenotypes.

To become familiar with the utility of lab tests in the diagnosis of this entity Case A 14-year-old female with a medical history of Rett syndrome presented with respiratory illness, fatigue, and pneumonia for 2-3 months. Respiratory secretion for culture and RT-PCR and bronchial washing for cytology and differential cell count were received. The bronchial washing specimen revealed scattered atypical squamoid cells with large nuclei, high nuclearto-cytoplasmic ratio, and hyperchromatic, smudged chromatin with a suggestion of nuclear inclusions in background of intense acute inflammation, reactive respiratory epithelial cells, and pulmonary macrophages. The cellblock material showed similar findings. Immunohistochemically, the scattered atypical cells were decorated by CK7, but nonreactive to p40; the profile suggested that those cells are pneumocytes. Representative images are shown in Fig. 6 .38a-d.SARS, a new human emergent infectious disease mainly involving the lower respiratory tract, became a worldwide outbreak in 2003, affecting more than 8000 patients, with a fatality rate of 9.2%. A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a member of a family of large, positive, single-stranded RNA viruses, was identified as the etiological agent for this disease. The key pulmonary pathology is that of DAD, featured by pronounced pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation. There are interstitial thickening, fibrosis, and intraalveolar exudates with granulation tissue formation, as well as sparsely inflammatory cell infiltrates, including macrophages (often multinucleated forms) and lymphocytes. Depending on different phases in the disease progression, the degree of fibrosis and the composition of inflammatory cells may vary. Other pathologic findings, such as prominent vascular injury, hemophagocytosis, squamous metaplasia, apoptosis, and atypical pneumocytes, including multinucleated giant pneumocytes with irregularly distributed nuclei or pneumocytes with large atypical nuclei, prominent eosinophilic nucleoli, and granular amphophilic cytoplasm, were reported. However, distinct viral inclusions were not apparent. Ancillary tests, such as in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, viral isolation, or RT-PCR are necessary to confirm the viral infection.For the index case, serology testing and culture of the respiratory secretion were positive for coronavirus OC43. Electron microscopy (EM) revealed viral-like particles in pneumocytes, but not in macrophages or other cell types of lung. The findings confirmed the viral infection.The atypical pneumocytes, metaplastic squamous cells, and apoptosis may mimic malignancy. Caution should be exercised in the interpretation of specimens from patients with a history of SARS and coronavirus infection. The awareness of clinical history and the limited amount of atypical cells should alert the pathologists to avoid overdiagnosis in this clinical setting.",
