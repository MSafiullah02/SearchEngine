At the start of the pandemic, Africa seemed \u2018safe\u2019 and insulated as it watched many high-income countries across the world grapple with the devastating effects of the coronavirus. Sadly, this \u2018safe\u2019 state only lasted until February when Egypt recorded the first case of COVID-19 in Africa [1]. The viral infection has since spread to 45 of the 47 countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) African region, with 22,376 confirmed cases and 899 deaths as at 29 April 2020 [2]. With the declaration of the situation as a global pandemic, everything from the global economy, financial markets, and manufacturing industries to tourism, travel, and hospitality industries and even the educational sector have come to a crashing halt worldwide.",

In the face of the growing number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 across Africa, the redirection of most national efforts, resources, and manpower, including the recall of retired HCPs, it is evident that the detecting and reporting of adverse effects of medicines and medical devices [including personal protective equipment (PPE)] will be further pushed to the back burner. This will worsen the already poor reporting of adverse effects, with the consequence that adverse effects experienced by patients and/or users of medical devices and PPE at this time are unlikely to be documented. As already noted, this is the time for more vigilance and documentation of the effects of products used to treat patients, including, as previously mentioned, the hidden effects of COVID-19.",

Unfortunately, during this period of economic downturn and uncertainties, newly established local QPPV positions may be some of the first casualties in the fight between COVID-19 and the economic survival of pharma companies.

Additionally, the current situation presents an opportunity for PV experts to collaborate with frontline HCPs to undertake drug utilization studies to inform clinical and regulatory decisions.

In 2018, the Tanzania Medicine & Medical Devices Authority became the first African medicine regulatory authority to achieve a functional regulatory status, including in its PV functions [18]. It was recently followed by Ghana in May 2020 [19]. This means, in Africa, only Tanzania [18] and Ghana [19] have systems considered by the global benchmarking tool (GBT) standard to be stable and functional regulatory systems [20]. Clearly, considerable work remains to be done in strengthening regulatory systems, including PV, in African countries for them to deliver on their mandate to ensure access to safe, quality-assured, and efficacious medicines and health technologies. Some of the key areas for strengthening PV systems as prescribed by the GBT include establishing:Legal provisions, regulations, policies, and guidelines to define the regulatory framework for PV.Adequate structures and human resources for PV.Procedures for PV activities, including the use of data for decision making.Mechanisms to monitor performance and output.Mechanisms to promote transparency, accountability, and communication.",
