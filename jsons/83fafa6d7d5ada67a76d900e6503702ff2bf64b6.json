The media coverage of the aftermath of the tsunami refl ected the uncertainty that existed in the available information concerning fatalities, the risks of further earthquakes and the unfolding nature of the nuclear accident. The coverage of the disaster took place on a global scale as the media presented, often in real time, the unfolding nature of the event accompanied by a range of associated scripts and narratives provided by commentators. At the same time, the coverage highlighted the inherent uncertainty that was present within the disaster itself. Experts were brought in to provide further insights into a situation where their access to accurate information was invariably Editorial Review limited and the media sought to provide answers to issues where the levels of uncertainty surrounding the information fl ows was simply too high. On occasions, the presence of too much information -often information that was highly codifi ed -created problems of interpretation and speculation, and occasionally served to heighten the uncertainty surrounding the event.",

Perhaps the most obvious medium to long-term impact will be the effects on proposed and existing nuclear power programmes, as the vulnerability of reactors to geo-physical impact -as well as other forms of ' failure ' -has caused several governments to reconsider their strategies for energy provision. The reliance on ' dwindling ' oil supplies, the social and political volatility of many of the world ' s leading oil producers, the investment required to make alternative technologies both viable and available and the continuing debates around climate change have all created a complex energy policy problem for many countries, many of whom may have seen nuclear provision as a means of bridging their potential shortfall in generative capacity for energy production.",

Emergency planners will be considering, for example, the impact that a similar event could have on the western coastline of the United States, and especially in cities like Seattle, San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco. There are also implications for those nuclear reactors located on, or close to, the coast -such as those at the San Onofre and Diablo Canyon plants in California. The implications of the 2011 disaster are therefore considerable. Unlike many of the countries struck by the ' Boxing Day ' tsunami in 2004 1 , Japan is widely considered to be one of the most earthquake-prepared countries in the world. However, the severity of this earthquake and its subsequent crises, have illustrated how important the scale of such disasters can be in overwhelming the most prepared of organisations or nations.",

The disaster provides an illustration of how risk in one part of a system can have implications elsewhere. It highlighted the importance and inevitable limitations that are associated with the planning assumptions that are often made around extreme events. It also illustrated the manner in which failures in one part of a ' system ' can erode or overwhelm systems defences elsewhere. The initial planning assumptions around the ' scale ' of a potential tsunami, for example, led to the construction of a sea wall of a given size, not to mention the wider issue of the acceptability of constructing nuclear plants in seismically-active zones. The breaching of this Editorial Review fi rst line of defence led to problems with the pumping sub-system and initiated the sequence of events that ultimately gave rise to the radioactive release. The disaster illustrated how important our assumptions are in preparing for catastrophic events and how those assumptions can change over time and across space.",

This is not to constrain the publication of research fi ndings that deal with other aspects of risk but rather to give shape to, and encourage, the development of debates that consider the evolutionary nature of risk and its role within our societies.

One of the key aspects of many of these debates around modernity has been seen as the ' erosion ' of time and its associated abstraction from place. The argument that time has been ' emptied out ' ( Tsoukas, 2005 ) and that distance has been eroded by the development of new means of interaction ( Cairncross, 1997 ) have been used to suggest that both time and space have been abstracted within modern societies.

Within these debates, risk has also often been portrayed as becoming more global in its scope -climate change is the oft-quoted example used to legitimise this argument -and many of the burden of proof debates Editorial Review around cause-and-effect relationships have inevitably taken on the guise of an expert-mediated, but socially constructed discussion. These debates have often proved to be problematic in terms of a resolution as there has often been insuffi cient evidence to ensure the implementation of an agreed policy solution. There have also been suggestions that, despite increased attempts at control, these new forms of risk have continued to emerge and evolve in ever more complex forms ( Perrow, 1984 ; Sagan, 1993 ; Erikson, 1994 ; Tenner, 1996 ; Reason, 1997 ) and this has served to erode public confi dence in the abilities of organisations to manage risk. In order to frame our discussion around these issues, it is possible to set out a range of observations made by Tsoukas (2005) around risk and modernity as these provide a useful starting point for framing the debate.",

In contrast, he argues that many of the modern-day threats that we face have the potential for much more of a global dynamic ( Tsoukas, 2005 ) . For some hazards, the modernisation of society has had a signifi cant effect. We have, for example, created a set of socio-technical risks that have a considerable ability to cause harm over long distances. There are also many forms of ' natural ' hazard that have perhaps greater potential to cause harm on a global scale. One obvious example concerns the range of disease outbreaks that have caused considerable loss of life in earlier periods and which still generate signifi cant problems today ( Oldstone, 1998 ; Crawford, 2000 ; Cantor, 2001 ) . As the outbreaks of SARS and, more recently, Swine Flu (H1N1) have illustrated, modern societies have also developed more effective methods of mitigating those hazards. At the same time, developments in transport may also have led to an increase in the potential speed of transmission. The confi guration of risk is, therefore, a constantly evolving process arising from the interaction between multiple elements that are present in its particular ' landscape ' . It is the interaction between ' natural ' and socio-economic activities, for example, that creates the potential for increased populations at risk and it is impossible to remove the human element from such disasters ( Steinberg, 2000 ( Steinberg, , 2001 .",

Obvious examples here include the range of viruses which mutate and evolve (the BSE outbreak, HIV and a range of other exotic forms of virus) and which display adaptive and emergent characteristics that require new responses from organisations and the health professions. At the same time, the societies that play host to such hazards have also ' evolved ' -both in terms of their mobilities, population densities, and as well as scientifi c capabilities to deal with the task demands of Editorial Review such threats. The mechanisms by which we live and organise ourselves has increased the population densities of countries and has also put a strain on the resources that we need for survival. We now seek our resources across large distances with the result that we create new forms of potential vulnerabilities in terms of our supply chains and the continuity of supply of those resources. At the same time, resource exploitation creates a spatial imbalance of problems for different societal groups ( Fischbacher-Smith and Hudson, 2010 ) .",

The combination of these factors, and the role played by the media, has resulted in a heightened perception of risk among many sections of society, despite the fact that we invariably live longer and have a better quality of life than our ancestors ( Giddens, 1990 ; Beck, 1992 ; Gigerenzer, 2002 ; Gardner, 2009 ). The result has been the creation of a ' culture of fear ' in which the media heightens our concerns around risk ( Gardner, 2009 ) . It is the ' intangible ' nature of such risks, the diffi culties that exist around the determination of cause and effect relationships, and the central role played by expertise within the determination of those risks, that have typifi ed much of the current discourse around risk in society ( Beck, 1992 ; Nowotny et al , 2001 ) . A key component of this process has been the role and nature of powerful elites in shaping policy agendas for the control of such hazards ( Collingridge, 1984 ( Collingridge, , 1992 Smith, 1990 ; Smith and Tombs, 1995 ; Irwin, 2001 Irwin, , 2006 ).",

It is this issue of measurement, especially for low probability, extreme and emergent forms of risk, that provides risk management with a signifi cant challenge ( Kunreuther et al , 2001 ; Kunreuther and Pauly, 2004 ; Taleb, 2007 ; Wilson et al , 2010 ) .

There is little doubt that many of the current issues facing societies result from either direct human action or from the increasingly interconnected nature of our societies. We have created socio-technical systems that are both ' tightly coupled ' and ' interactively complex ' ( Perrow, 1984 ) with the result that they fail quickly and do so across a range of interconnected ' pathways ' . The hazard range associated with the failures of some of these socio-technical systems has been considerable (in the case of Chernobyl) as has the death toll associated with the events (particularly, Bhopal) ( Hazarika, 1987 ; Shrivastava, 1987 ; Lapierre and Moro, 2002 ) . Human agency also has a role to play in terms of determining the population at risk. The SARS outbreak in 2003, for example, illustrated the speed at which disease can spread both as a function of the improvements in travel times and as a result of population density ( Chan-Yeung and Yu, 2003 ; Riley et al , 2003 ; Wenzel and Edmond, 2003 ) . The 1918 -1919 fl u pandemic may also have spread due to the presence of large numbers of suitable ' hosts ' in confi ned spaces and the movement of large numbers of people in the aftermath of World War I. There is, however, still considerable debate concerning the origins of that epidemic ( Oxford, 2000 ( Oxford, , 2001 Barry, 2004 ; Oxford et al , 2005 ) , the mechanisms of its transmission ( Smallman-Raynor et al , 2002 ; Chowell et al , 2008 ) , along with its implications for modern pandemics ( Morens and Fauci, 2007 ) and bio-terrorism ( Schoch-Spana, 2000 ) . Our abilities to learn from past events is a key component of the development of prevention and mitigation strategies by organisations and should, therefore, be a central component of risk management.",

Perhaps one of the more topical of such ' unreal ' or ' not yet events ' ( Tsoukas, 2005 ) concerns the risks associated with terrorism, although there are a range of other ' doomsday ' scenarios that have attracted attention within the literature. The impact of terrorist-related risks on policy making has been considerable -especially in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks -and terrorism presents some interesting challenges for the processes of risk assessment. Tsoukas argues that many of the counterfactual approaches used within terrorism debates serve to draw ' the future into the present ' (p. 45). The problem for policy makers is that the future is surrounded by high degrees of uncertainty, particularly for terrorist and other ' intentional ' events. In these cases, the issue is less with a concern on the probabilistic aspects of risk (although they are still important), but more with the motivations and capabilities of the individuals who would seek to cause harm. Another important aspect of this process concerns the vulnerabilities of those organisations that are targeted for attack. A common response to such Editorial Review concerns has often been the move to implement the ' precautionary principle ' within policy making, and especially for those risks that are considered to have signifi cant consequences ( Deville and Harding, 1997 ; Tickner, 1999 ; Fischbacher-Smith and Calman, 2010 ) .",

If we consider some of the underpinning processes that drive these debates then we can argue that they relate to the mechanisms by which risks are generated, transmitted and ' realised ' -that is, how the mechanisms of damage occur. These processes are underpinned by four main elements -place, space, time and scale, and we need to elaborate on each of these in turn.",

            "text": "Place is important within any discussion of risk, as it serves to frame the ' location ' within which a hazard is generated and also provides the setting in which damage takes place. In other literatures (most notably in work dealing with environmental impact), this relationship is often seen in terms of a ' source ' and ' sink ' relationship that can be separated by space and time. It can be seen as an important element in the processes around the development of ecological niches and the associated adaptation of populations to environmental pressures ( Kawecki, 1995 ; Chen et al , 2008 ) . We also often associate a particular place with the damage caused by a specifi c hazard, disaster or crisis. As places represent the locations of populations -in the context of our present discussions this represents those who are deemed to be ' at risk ' -and, given the predominance of anthropocentric concerns within risk debates, then we often frame the damage Editorial Review caused within the context of particular places. Places also represent the context for differing perceptions of risk and the associated levels of acceptability that become associated with them. The spatial dynamics of risk (often expressed in terms of risk contours) and the associated perceptions of those deemed to be at risk ( Smith and Irwin, 1984 ) are inevitably grounded in place and are therefore important elements of the debates around acceptability. Place is, therefore, a central element of the various processes highlighted by Tsoukas. Time is also an important element in confi guring risk -the length of exposure, the time taken for damage to be caused, the ability to take mitigating action and the intergenerational aspects of exposures to hazards -are all elements by which time gives shape to risk. The ' tight coupling ' ( Perrow, 1984 ) , that is commonly accepted to exist in modern socio-technical systems, can be seen as a key factor in which such systems fail quickly. The speed of interaction between elements of the system can be seen as an important aspect of highly effi cient systems but may well impact on their effectiveness at the point at which an initial failure moves the system out of its normal range of ' design ' perturbations. At this point, the speed of failure may overwhelm the abilities of systems ' controllers to bring the system back within its control parameters. Our abilities to process information will also be constrained by the time it takes us to ' decode ' the volume of inherently codifi ed information that accompanies a systems failure. Time, therefore, provides a serious constraint on the abilities of management (as both a function and a process) to make effective decisions to bring a tightly coupled system back under control. The ' distributed ' nature of many organisations adds a further temporal dimension to the problem, but also brings the issue of space into the equation.",

At its simplest level, space can be seen in terms of the hazard range associated with various forms of risk -the ways in which the source of a hazard and the damage that it causes are connected. Space connects the various places and time periods over which risk is both generated and realised. A key aspect of modernity concerns the extension of that space and the emergence of ' new ' forms of connecting ' fabrics ' -such as the internet and other forms of telecommunications -that have given rise to new opportunities as well as new ways of causing harm. In an increasingly globalised context, these connecting pathways may extend across considerable distances. The extent of this connectivity has given rise to inherently ' complex ' and ' tightly coupled ' ( Perrow, 1984 ) forms of damage pathways -which often beguile and confound those who try to control them. One of the observations made by Tsoukas is that new forms of risk have generated different spatial dynamics -the damage caused is now often more diffuse and on a different scale to previous forms of hazard where the locality of harm was often much closer to the source of the hazard.",

( Taylor, 2008, p. 14 ) A core proposition in this review is that risk management is an evolutionary process. By failing to change and adapt, organisations embed vulnerabilities within their processes and procedures. The twenty-fi rst century opened with the attacks on the United States on September 11 and they illustrated how limiting managerial assumptions can be around issues of risk and security. The attacks spawned a body of work that considered the implications of evolutionary theory for the development of risk and security ( Taylor, 2008 ; Sagarin, 2008a, b ) . The underlying rational was that Nature is never static, and organisms and lineages of organisms survive in part by maintaining variation in the face of nature ' s variability. Unvarying routines of the enhanced security apparatus in the United States were clearly not designed to cope with the unpredictable security environment after 9 / 11. ( Sagarin, 2008b, p. 5 ) The basis of this approach is that in order to deal with the variety inherent in the threat, organisations needed to develop suffi cient variety in the responses and controls that were put in place to respond to the risk. Such an approach is based upon Ashby ' s Law of Requisite Variety that requires us to manage the complexity in the environment with complexity in terms of the organisation ' s response capabilities ( Ashby, 1956 ( Ashby, , 1958 .",

The issues of prediction are inevitably problematic given the unique and emergent nature of many forms of risk. Prevention is also potentially problematic given the role of assumptions within the control strategies for risk within socio-technical systems. If we cannot prevent such risks then how do we evolve our responses to them? This has become an inherently diffi cult question for policy makers who have turned to the concept of resilience as a means of addressing it. The problem with resilience concerns the manner in which we defi ne it and the subsequent policy formulation that takes shape from this defi nition.",

            "text": "Depending on its disciplinary origins, resilience has two quite distinct interpretations. The fi rst of these has its roots in engineering approaches to resilience and is framed, essentially, in terms of how the system bounces back from any shocks that it experiences. The second approach is grounded in research undertaken in systems biology and it adopts a more adaptive approach to dealing with issues of resilience ( Holling, 1973 ; Peterson et al , 1998 ; Gunderson, 2000 ; Carpenter et al , 2001 ) . One can argue that the engineering approach to resilience is inappropriate for the broad set of task demands that are generated by those events that fall within the risk portfolios of many Western governments portfolio. Such a portfolio of hazards would require organisations to develop and sustain a range of capabilities that would allow them to deal with the unpredictability and requirements for adaptiveness that have been associated with many of the examples discussed here. This dynamism would require the creation of a form of adaptive management that does not seem to be present in many organisations and a key challenge for the research community concerns the nature of this approach. Although research around high reliability organisations ( Guy, 1990 ; Roberts, 1990 ; La Porte, 1996 ) may offer some interesting conceptual insights into the possible organisational approaches needed within risk management, further work is needed to apply these concepts to different organisational and cultural settings. A further issue concerns the notion of a ' measure ' of resilience that can be used within industrial sectors or regions and this is seen as an inherently problematic issue for policy makers. 2 Again it raises a set of challenges for the research communities around how we can, or indeed should, seek to reduce the construct of resilience to a single measure -especially given the inherent uncertainties associated with such a process.",

It has sought to frame the issues around risk within an evolutionary context in the hope that such a stimulus may lead to an evolution in the issues addressed by the journal. At its core, Risk Management seeks to be multidisciplinary and the next stage in its own evolution needs to be in terms of impacting upon the policy and practice agendas for risk. One of the strategic developments for this journal is to ensure that it acts as a conduit for research into practice. By encouraging the development of policy relevant research, it is hoped that Risk Management can become a mechanism by which both the research community and policy makers can interact in an attempt to address some of the issues identifi ed in this review. The challenge for the research community is to seek to develop the capabilities that organisations need to deal with an evolving portfolio of risk and to encourage and sustain the processes of learning that are central to both an evolutionary approach and the development of resilience.",
