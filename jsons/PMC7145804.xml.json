            "text": "Newcastle disease virus replication depends on the translation machinery of the host cell and thus it is subject to the control mechanisms modulated by host translation factors10. The first stage of protein translation is the most regulated phase and eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) family genes play important roles in this regulation11. Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) is a protein complex with three subunits, eIF2\u03b1, eIF2\u03b2 and eIF2\u03b312 encoded by EIFS1, EIFS2 and EIFS3 genes, respectively, while eIF2B has five subunits, eIF2B\u03b1 to eIF2B\u03b513 encoded by EIF2B1 to EIF2B5 genes, respectively. The beginning of translation depends on the formation of the preinitiation complex composed by the 40 s ribosomal subunit, eIF3, eIF1A and the ternary complex: eIF2:GTP:tRNAMet. Under normal conditions eIF2:GDP binds to a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B, which makes the exchange of GDP for GTP14. However, phosphorylation of the eIF2\u03b1 subunit of eIF2 by one of the eIF2 kinases, such as the protein kinase R (PKR, encoded by EIF2AK2 gene) or protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK, EIF2AK3 gene), inhibits the initiation of translation and causes translation shut-off by preventing the conversion of eIF2-GDP into eIF2-GTP by eIF2B15. Factors such as stress in the endoplasmic reticulum16 and the presence of viral RNA17 may stimulate the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 by PERK and PKR, respectively. The dsRNA generated during NDV infection stimulates PKR activity, and thus, eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, which is followed by antiviral action in infected cells18.",

These two lines have been used to evaluate the mechanisms of genetic response to several different pathogens22\u201324. During NDV infection, the Fayoumis had faster viral clearance than the Leghorns from 2- to 6-days post infection (dpi) and higher serum antibody level at 10 dpi compared to the Leghorns, and thus the Fayoumi are considered to be relatively more resistant to NDV than the Leghorns20,25. Several ISGs were upregulated in NDV challenged chickens from the two lines; therefore, we hypothesized that some pathways specifically activated in challenged Fayoumis might contribute to the greater relative resistance to NDV observed in the Fayoumi chickens. Pathway analysis of transcriptome data from trachea20 and spleen21 tissues have shown that eIF2 signaling may be one of the pathways related to higher resistance to NDV.",

Within nonchallenged chickens, effect of chicken genetic line was found on the expression of two eIF2 genes: Fayoumis had higher expression of EIF2B5 (2 and 6 dpi; both FDR = 0.06; Fig. 3a,b), and highly significant lower expression of EIF2S3 (2 and 6 dpi; both FDR < 0.001; Fig. 3c,d) than the Leghorn chickens. Comparing genetic lines within NDV challenged chickens, the Fayoumis again had highly significant lower expression of EIF2S3 (2 and 6 dpi; both FDR < 0.001; Fig. 3c,d) than the Leghorns. NDV challenged Fayoumis also had significantly lower expression of EIF2B5 compared to the Leghorn chickens, but only at 2 dpi (FDR = 0.02; Fig. 3a). The highest fold changes were observed in expression of the EIF2S3 gene. The lower expression of eIF2 family genes in NDV challenged Fayoumis may illustrate a mechanism of resistance, in that NDV propagation may be delayed in Fayoumis compared to Leghorn due to a reduction in the host protein synthesis machinery. Different subunits of eIF2 and eIF2B with different functions can be regulated to help the innate immune response contain NDV replication.",

Gene expression changes in the immune response to the NDV challenge in two highly inbred lines and their sublines, the Fayoumi (M5.1 and M15.2) and the Leghorn chickens (Ghs6 and Ghs13), have shown that the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) can contribute to the genetic resistance against NDV28. Evaluation of the transcriptome of these two genetically distinct lines also suggests that NDV infection may cause upregulation of different genes in a line-dependent manner19.

Recognition of viral RNA by TLR7 triggers signaling for cytokines with antiviral activity to be upregulated29. Infection with NDV causes a strong immune response as showed by the upregulation of different cytokines and chemokines4. Type I interferon production is also induced by NDV infection30 and favors an effective host response. Interferon \u03b1 and \u03b2 bind to a common receptor comprising IFN-\u03b1 receptor 1 (IFNAR1) and IFNAR2 subunits and signal through the JAK-STAT pathway to induce the transcription of several ISGs related to the antiviral response31. Although, IFN\u03b1 and \u03b2 play an important role against viral infection, each one may signal through different ISGs and may have different antiviral activities32. IFN\u03b2 may be mainly committed to signaling and immune modulation, while IFN\u03b1 could have the strongest antiviral activity against vesicular stomatitis virus, avian influenza virus, and NDV infection in chickens32. Because interferons act in the first line of defense against viruses, the expression pattern for IFNB after infection, i.e. higher expression in Leghorn at the later time, could indicate later signaling to effector molecules in the Leghorns.",

            "text": "OAS is one of the main IFN effectors that acts in the early phase of viral infection to initiate degradation of viral RNA, resulting in the inhibition of viral replication33. After being activated, OAS promotes the synthesis of 2\u20135 oligoadenylate, which activates RNase L. Upon binding 2\u2032-5\u2032-linked oligoadenylates (2\u20135 A), activated RNase L degrades cellular and viral RNA34. This RNase L-dependent pathway is best characterized; however, recent studies have described OAS antiviral activity through a RNase L-independent pathway35,36. In chickens, OAS has been shown to be encoded by only one gene (OASL)37 and to be upregulated after infection with different viruses38,39 including NDV3,4,21. The role of OASL in the control of NDV replication was confirmed in vitro8, as the overexpression of OASL reduced the replication of NDV and the absence of OASL significantly enhanced viral replication. In our study, OASL was upregulated by NDV challenge in Leghorns at 2 dpi. Upregulated expression of the OASL gene was also observed in challenged Fayoumi and Leghorn in our previous study using RNAseq.21. Besides the function described above, OAS also is related to programed cell death40. Genetically controlled apoptosis in response to viral infection can help to reduce the spread of progeny virus41; however, the role of the OAS/apoptosis interaction in the response to NDV infection is unclear and needs to be further investigated. Lower expression of OASL in the spleen of NDV challenged Fayoumis was found at 6 than at 2 dpi. Because the OAS-RNase L pathway requires production of both viral dsRNA and type I IFN together to upregulate OAS and activate RNase L42, we suggest the decreased expression of OASL at 6 dpi in the Fayoumis is due to the lower type I interferon expression and the lower viral load20 in Fayoumis at this time point.",

The initiation step of translation requires the ternary complex formed by eIF2-GTP and tRNAMet to assemble the pre-initiation complex. To set up the ternary complex, eIF2:GDP binds to eIF2B, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, which makes the exchange of GDP by GTP44. Although the precise mechanism and function of eIF2 subunits has not been fully described in chickens, in mammals this process can be regulated to prevent viral replication and spread to other tissues through protein synthesis shut-off45.",

In chicken cells challenged by NDV, PKR undergoes autophosphorylation and phosphorylates the eIF2\u03b1 subunit10. Phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 turns it into an inhibitor of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B and prevents the formation of the translation initiation complex eIF2:GTP:tRNAMet that is required for the initiation of protein synthesis15. In vitro NDV infection caused PKR activation, eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and viral replication inhibition in HeLa cells18. Phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 after NDV infection in DF-1 chicken fibroblast cells also induces higher translation of ATF4 and an increase in growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein 34 (GADD34) expression10. GADD34 has been described as the link between eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and immune system, however, the mechanism by which GADD34 controls cytokine synthesis after viral infection remains unclear47. The phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 can also occur by Protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress16, however the role of PERK in viral containment in chickens has not been investigated.",

NDV can manipulate the PKR/eIF2a signaling cascade to favor viral replication by arresting cellular mRNA inside stress granules49. We hypothesize that the host cell can use different mechanisms to overcome these viral strategies. Here we show for the first time the relationship of NDV infection on the expression of genes encoding subunits of eIF2 and eIF2B. We observed that NDV challenge downregulated the expression of EIF2B5 in the Fayoumis at 2 and 6 dpi and in Leghorns at 2 dpi.

They are encoded by EIF2B5 and IEF2B3 genes, respectively. The subunits eIF2B\u03b1 (encoded by EIF2B1 gene), \u03b2 (EIF2B2 gene) and \u03b4 (EIF2B4 gene) form the regulatory subcomplex43. In this study, we assumed that the chicken genes encoding these subunits have the same interactions as in the mammalian model because eIF2 and eIF2B structures have not been fully investigated in chicken. We present the novel finding that infection with NDV could result in the inactivation of the translation initiation factors eIF2 and/or eIF2B in a chicken tissue. We demonstrated that NDV challenged Fayoumis had lower expression than NDV challenged Leghorns of a gene encoding a eIF1B subunit with regulatory (EIF2B5) activity, as well as a gene encoding a subunit of eIF2 (EIF2S3). Both of these genes could contribute to the difference in relative resistance between these lines. It is important to notice that lower expression of EIF2S3 gene was also observed in Fayoumis than Leghorns for nonchallenged chickens, which shows a difference between the genetic lines under homeostatic conditions. The activity of eIF2B appears to depend on the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 as well the phosphorylation in the eIF2B itself 50. Other results demonstrate that the catalytic and regulatory subcomplexes in eIF2B can both bind eIF2 independently in vitro51; the interaction between eIF2 and the regulatory subcomplex is increased by phosphorylation of eIF2, whereas the interaction of catalytic subcomplex and eIF2 it is not dependent on eIF2 phosphorylation. Dysregulation of eIF2B\u03b1 may be sufficient to make cells more susceptible to viral infection by neutralizing the consequences of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation52. Finally, reduced expression of the eIF2B\u03b5 subunit has been related to reduced protein synthesis in vitro53. All these results show the relation between different eIF2B subunits and the control of protein synthesis. Because inhibition of eIF2B can cause the down-regulation of global protein synthesis by reducing the cellular level of ternary complexes that are available for translation initiation13, the differential expression of EIF2B5 observed between the two challenged lines could be related to the higher ability of Fayoumis to reduce the replication efficiency of NDV. It should be noted that our results were observed in the spleen which could suggest that the eIF2/eIF2B pathway could act as systemic mediators of interferons.",

Slopes were determined with five points of a 10-fold dilution series using pooled RNA for the housekeeping gene and target-specific amplicons as the template to determine PCR efficiency of each primer/gene set. Median 28S Ct represents the median Ct value of all individual samples for the housekeeping gene.
