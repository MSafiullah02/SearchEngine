Asians and Europeans may remember the war in Vietnam as the defining issue of Lyndon Johnson's presidency (November 1963\u2013January 1969), but American memory of that era is divided along foreign and domestic lines. In the U.S., unpleasant recollection of the war years competes with memories of the lingering legacy of ambitious but discredited social policy legislation rhetorically known as the \u2018Great Society\u2019 programs. The performance of those programs generally fell short of the promises made by the president and his congressional coalition.2 During the 1970s, some researchers highlighted a common denominator in the disappointing policy outcomes: poor implementation (cf., Williams and Elmore, 1976; Nakamura and Smallwood, 1980).",

In the second edition of Implementing Public Policy, Hill and Hupe (2009) take several pages to develop a working definition. After reviewing variants in the public policy literature, they defer to Ferman (1990) and settle on wording that is indisputable but vague: implementation is \u2018what happens between policy expectations and perceived policy results\u2019. Such a definition may be useful for the scope of their book, as it underscores the breadth and significance of the concept. For our purposes, however, more precision is needed, and we opt for the simple definition offered by Mazmanian and Sabatier (1983, p. 1): \u2018Implementation is the carrying out of a basic policy decision\u2019 made by government officials exercising formal authority.",

The implementation stage occurs after a policy is considered, formulated, and authoritatively adopted.3 Studying the implementation stage per se has emerged as the province of academic political scientists. They identify and explain the origin of obstacles that lead to disappointing policy outcomes. In contrast, analysts trained in public policy graduate schools use an eclectic, multi\u2010disciplinary research approach to implementation issues. The challenge for the policy analyst is to reduce the likelihood of problems during the implementation stage by better planning during the formulation stage.",

Initially conceived as a business management tool (Forrester, 1958), the SD methodology was soon applied to public sector issues, beginning with Forrester's (1969) model of economic growth and decline in large American cities. SD has become a model\u2010based policy\u2010design discipline. It is natural to ask where the concept of implementation fits in the 50\u2010year\u2010old paradigm.

That requires building and testing an explanatory model. In the second stage, the challenge is to design and test policies that alleviate the problem; that is improve the dynamic performance of the system. That requires building a policy structure (another \u2018model\u2019 if you will) that can be integrated with the explanatory model. Forrester made this distinction forty years ago and reiterated it recently. \u2018First \u2026 generate a model that creates the problem. Only if we understand the processes leading to the difficulties can we hope to [secondly] restructure the system so that the internal processes lead in a different direction\u2019 (Forrester, 1969, p. 113). In a December 2009 listserv posting, Forrester joined a discussion about climate change policy with a similar comment: \u2018A model should demonstrate how the symptoms are being generated. \u2026 Only by clearly understanding what is causing the problem can one begin to see where [policy] attention should be focused\u2019.5\n",

Weil (1980, 1983) critiqued his own projects and identified conditions and consulting strategies that favoured effective implementation.

It helps a modeller estimate the potential impact of a general strategy for influencing key feedback loops in a problematic system, what Richardson and Pugh (1989, p. 322) call finding a \u2018leverage point\u2019 in the system. For example, in an epidemic model, a key parameter is the probability of infection when a contact occurs between an infectious person and a susceptible person. Simulation experiments with different parameter assumptions provide estimates of the potential payoff from a strategy aimed at lowering the infection probability as a means of weakening the problematic reinforcing loop that drives the infection rate. It is quite another task to estimate and evaluate the expected payoff from a particular policy. This second task requires modelling the process by which the policy eventually has its expected impact on the infection probability. Parameter testing begs the question of how something represented by a parameter in a model gets changed in the real world. Specifically, we need to know what combination of tangible resources, perceptual and attitudinal adjustments, institutional capacity and coordination, authoritative and voluntary cooperation, and process time are needed to implement changes that would produce the desired parameter value.",

Recall, for example that in the previous section emphasis was placed on (a) the importance of a valid causal theory and (b) the skills, resources and technology available in the health system. In this context, consider items #1 and #15 in Figure 9. For the epidemic problem, \u2018availability of a valid causal theory and technology\u2019 relates to the implementing agencies having a valid epidemiological theory (e.g. as represented by the SEIR model) and having the requisite technical means to act in accordance with that theory in specific situations (e.g. they can identify and isolate infectious persons). In our example, \u2018Resources of constituency groups\u2019 is relevant to hospital capacity for isolating infectious persons. The epidemic example in this paper draws on only a small part of a framework that has broad potential for helping modellers ask the right questions of contextual experts during the policy\u2010design stage of modelling.",

The mental model will influence the aggregation level in the policy structure of the SD computer model and, ultimately, the assessment of a policy's feasibility. Therefore, an SD modeller of public policy problems needs to develop an understanding of the relevant governmental policy structure in addition to the structure responsible for the historical dynamic problem.",
