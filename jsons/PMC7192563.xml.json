According to the WHO Covid-19 situation report of March 29, Italy is the most affected European country, with 92.472 total cases and 10.023 deaths. The virus is transmitted mainly by inhalation of respiratory droplets from both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Fever, fatigue, and dry cough are the most common symptoms at clinical presentation. Approximately 13\u201320% of infected individuals develop severe respiratory symptoms with radiological findings of interstitial involvement, requiring assisted oxygenation [1\u20133]. A low number of routine autopsies is performed due to the high infectivity of the disease; accordingly, there are only a few reports in medical literature describing the histopathologic findings of SARS-CoV-2 infection [4, 5]. More in-depth investigations only come from SARS-Coronavirus outbreaks in the past [6].",

His clinical history was positive for a MALT lymphoma diagnosed 6 months before, with complete remission after therapy. According to pre-operatory imaging, obtained 3 weeks before surgery, the lesion was localized in the right inferior lobe, measured 2 cm and showed a solid appearance. There were no ground glass opacities. At admission, the patient was in good general condition, afebrile. A thoracoscopic lobectomy with lymph node dissection (stations 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, and 10) was performed, without intraoperative complications. After surgery, the patient developed progressive lymphopenia (with values ranging between 920 and 340 lymphocytes/\u03bcL from the first to the fifth post-operative day) and, on the scheduled date for discharge, had an episode of fever (38 \u00b0C) in the absence of respiratory symptoms. Thus, his antibiotic therapy was changed, with no improvement. A pharyngeal swab PCR test was performed, which confirmed the suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient was immediately transferred to the isolation ward where he developed cough, dyspnea, fatigue, and high fever (38\u201339 \u00b0C). SpO2 was stable between 96 and 98%. Both white blood cells (2570/\u03bcL) and lymphocytes counts were low (280/\u03bcL). A chest CT scan showed post-resection changes and bilateral, peripheral, and ill-defined ground-glass opacities, mainly involving the lower lobe, consistent with Covid-19 pneumonia (Fig. 1a).",

There were scanty fibrin depositions on the alveolar surfaces, in the absence of hyaline membranes (Fig. 2c). The interstitium showed edema and a mild inflammatory infiltrate, mainly composed of cytotoxic (CD8+) T lymphocytes (Fig. 3c\u2013f). Interestingly, there were diffuse aspects of neutrophil margination within small arterioles (Fig. 3d). Occasional fibrous plugs were also observed (Fig. 3c). Interstitial changes were more marked in the subpleural area, where mild fibrous thickening of alveolar septa was also observed (Fig. 2b).",

These features are similar to those described in SARS-CoV-2 infection and are consistent with the previously postulated mechanisms underlying pulmonary damage in SARS [8, 9]: the interaction between the virus and both pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages triggers a cascade of immunological events, with the production of cytokines and chemokines and expression of adhesion molecules by pneumocytes. This in turn drives an inflammatory response with prominent macrophages, neutrophils, and T CD8+ lymphocytes, which is responsible for the diffuse alveolar damage observed in the more severe and advanced stage of the disease. Indeed, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) has been reported as a common autopsy finding in SARS-CoV [6, 10\u201313]. A recent autopsy report highlights the finding of diffuse alveolar damage as the major lung feature also in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection [4]. However, the absence of DAD does not rule out the possibility of Covid-19 pneumonia, in the early stage of disease [12].",
