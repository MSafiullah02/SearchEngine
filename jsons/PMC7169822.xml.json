In cattle, \u03b2\u2010lactam antibiotics are frequently used for the treatment of common infections, such as mastitis or omphalitis, but also for life\u2010threatening conditions such as pneumonia or blood stream infection (BSI) and for surgical prophylaxis (Chicoine et al., 2008; Pardon et al., 2012). Scientific discussion on \u03b2\u2010lactamase nomenclature is still ongoing, but at present, broad\u2010spectrum \u03b2\u2010lactamases are divided into three categories (Giske et al., 2009). The first group are the extended\u2010spectrum beta\u2010lactamases (ESBLs), consisting of CTX\u2010M enzymes, which are most frequently found, SHV and TEM enzymes. These \u03b2\u2010lactamases are horizontally transferable through plasmids and sensitive to clavulanic acid. A second group holds the AmpC gene, which confers resistance to clavulanic acid as well. The third group consists of the carbapenemases (e.g. metallo \u03b2\u2010lactamases). Carbapenems are not registered for veterinary use, because they are used as last resort molecules for bacteria which show ESBL or AmpC resistance in humans. Important is the fact that broad\u2010spectrum \u03b2\u2010lactamase\u2010producing Enterobacteriaceae often display multidrug\u2010resistant phenotypes, further jeopardizing treatment options (Brolund, 2014).",

            "text": "In recent years, in the footsteps of a growing concern of the spread of ESBL/AmpC genes in the human population, ESBL genes have been found, with highly variable prevalence, in companion animals and in most food animals and derived products (Dierikx et al., 2012, 2013). In cattle, ESBL\u2010producing Escherichia coli strains are commonly found, predominantly in dairy cattle (Schmid et al., 2013). Also in veal calves, an industry renowned for its intensive antimicrobial use, a worrisome increase in ESBL gene prevalence from 4% in 1998 to 39% in 2010 was observed (Pardon et al., 2012; Hordijk et al., 2013a,b). A similarity in ESBL resistance genes and plasmids carrying these genes among isolates from animals and humans may suggest an exchange of resistance between different reservoirs (Dierikx et al., 2012; Madec et al., 2012). Whereas in human medicine, numerous reports on clinical infections [mainly urinary tract infections (UTI) and BSI] exist; evidence on the clinical relevance of veterinary ESBL\u2010producing isolates is limited to single papers on UTI in cats and dogs (Huber et al., 2013) or wound infections in horses (Smet et al., 2012). In cattle, ESBL genes have been detected in mastitis pathogens (E. coli and Klebsiella pneumonia) (Ghatak et al., 2013; Ohnishi et al., 2013; Timofte et al., 2014), but involvement in other diseases has not been documented.",

In particular, dairy cattle and veal calves are regarded as a reservoir (Hordijk et al., 2013a; Schmid et al., 2013; Haenni et al., 2014). In human medicine, BSIs with ESBL\u2010producing Enterobacteriaceae have been associated with treatment failure, prolonged hospitalization and an increased mortality risk (Brolund, 2014). Isolation of ESBL\u2010producing E. coli from a herd with increased mortality is reported in dairy cattle, but no direct evidence on the clinical relevance of this isolate could be provided (Liebana et al., 2006). The present report demonstrates that ESBL\u2010producing E. coli can cause treatment failure and mortality in calves as a consequence of septicaemic spread. Particularly important is that this infection occurred in calves with failure of passive transfer. Also in humans, especially immunocompromised persons such as infants are more susceptible to clinical infections with ESBL\u2010producing Enterobacteriaceae (Rettedal et al., 2012).",

All isolated strains harboured the bla\nCTX\u2010M14 gene, which is among the more frequent ESBL genes in cattle (Hordijk et al., 2013a,b). Additionally, six strains also showed an AmpC phenotype, of which two were isolated from the herd of origin. These isolates overexpressed their chromosomal AmpC gene due to mutations in the promotor and attenuator region (Caroff et al., 2000). The strains found in the faeces of case 1 and calves hospitalized at that time differed from the strain isolated from the abscess. Most likely, different strains had been introduced into the clinic by the calves from the problem herd, and cephalosporin use at the clinic further selected for different ESBL\u2010producing strains. The presence of two different strains at necropsy in case 1 is suggestive for plasmid transfer.",

The presence of this bacteria resulted in a prolonged hospitalization, increased anti\u2010microbial use and mortality. Particularly interesting is that clear evidence is provided on the source of the strain, namely a beef farm experiencing diarrhoea and high neonatal mortality. Cephalosporins were used on this particular farm and possibly selected for ESBLs and AmpC. These findings underscore the risk of introducing an ESBL strain into the own herd when purchasing animals, admitting them to a clinic or even just visiting other herds without substantial biosecurity measures. In spite of speculative, it is not unlikely that the increased mortality in the herd of origin is related to the ESBL\u2010producing E. coli, as over 30% of diarrhoea cases in calves are septicaemic and failure of passive transfer is the main risk factor (Fecteau et al., 1997). Possibly, the economic and ethical consequences of infections with ESBL\u2010producing E. coli might be worse and more widespread than currently perceived in practice.",
