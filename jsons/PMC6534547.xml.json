Moreover, CHD results in increased susceptibility to pneumonia9,10, tuberculosis11\u201313, and faster progression of hepatitis C virus (HCV)14 and HIV infections15. Furthermore, individuals who engage in CHD exhibit higher rates of postoperative complications16, slower recovery from infection and trauma16, poor vaccine responses17, and wound healing18. In contrast, chronic moderate drinking (CMD) has been associated with decreased cardiovascular disease, improved insulin sensitivity, and decreased incidence of the common cold in humans19\u201321.",

The earliest studies on CHD suggested that long-term drinking (several years to decades) is associated with reduction in T-cell numbers22, loss of na\u00efve T-cells22,23, increased CD8+ T-cell activation and proliferation24, and increased serum immunoglobulin levels25. CHD also results in higher levels of circulating pro-inflammatory mediators TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-626. Interpretation of these clinical studies are however confounded by age, erratic drinking patterns, sex, smoking status, use of recreational or illicit drugs, and nutritional deficiencies.",

On the other hand, moderate alcohol exposure can improve microbial clearance and delay cutaneous hypersensitivity responses in rodents37.

In this model, rhesus macaques are first induced to self-administer increasing daily doses of ethanol (0.5 g/kg/day to 1.5 g/kg/day over a 90-day period), then allowed \u201copen access\u201d to both water and 4% w/v ethanol for 22 h/day. During the open access phase to the protocol, the monkeys self-select their drinking status (CHD or CMD). This model presents a unique opportunity to study the impact of chronic voluntary moderate/heavy drinking on immunity in a highly translational outbred animal model without any overt tissue damage. We have leveraged this model to define the impact of chronic drinking on circulating and tissue resident immune cells41\u201346. Specifically, using this model, we have shown that CMD enhances while CHD attenuates vaccine responses42,44,47. More recently, we reported significant transcriptional changes in PBMC from female rhesus macaque following 12 months of CHD using RNA-Seq and concluded that the circulating innate immune cells bear the largest burden of chronic heavy drinking46. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the impact of both CHD and CMD on PBMC transcriptional profile and immune mediator production at resting and after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) using samples obtained from three cohorts of male rhesus macaques that followed a standard protocol of daily open-access to 4% ethanol in water solution for over 12 months.",

PBMC from CHD animals, on the other hand, exhibited a transcriptional profile consistent with a regulatory phase of LPS response.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of PBMC transcriptomes demonstrate a substantial effect of chronic drinking, where transcriptional profiles of samples obtained from CMD and CHD animals segregate away from those of control animals (Fig. 1a). Furthermore, alcohol is a strong determinant of resting PBMC transcriptome, demonstrated by reduced within group variability in gene expression profiles (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Differential gene expression analysis using edgeR (Supplementary Table 1) identified 452 and 338 differentially expressed genes (DEG; FDR \u2264 0.05) that were mostly upregulated with ethanol consumption in both CHD (410 of 452) and CMD (302 of 338) groups respectively relative to the control group (Fig. 1b) with a significant overlap between these two DEG subsets (p < 0.0001, hypergeometric test) (Fig. 1c).

While there is a significant overlap between gene expression changes induced by CMD and CHD, transcriptional changes exclusively detected with CHD enriched to blood coagulation, immune signaling and wound healing pathways. This observation is in line with the increased susceptibility to cardiovascular disease6,7 and impaired wound healing16,18,50 observed in subjects with alcohol use disorder. CMD on the other hand triggers activation of cellular metabolic pathways with dose-associated increases in expression of genes involved in transcriptional regulation and myeloid cell activation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of transcriptional changes in resting immune cells with moderate drinking. Furthermore, profiling miRNA repertoire further indicates that the pro-inflammatory impact of drinking is significant only in CHD and not in CMD.",

While post-LPS production of cytokines ex vivo is a measure of immunocompetence, spontaneous production of cytokines has been previously linked to a state of in vivo activation54. Indeed, in line with this hypothesis, a recent report in humans suggested that the ethanol dose consumed positively correlated with serum markers of monocyte activation55, providing a potential explanation for heighted pro-inflammatory responses to LPS in CHD. Interestingly, our analysis revealed dose-associated drop in spontaneously produced RANTES and post LPS induction of MIP-1\u03b2.

Alcohol has been shown to disrupt the gut intestinal epithelial barrier permeability56,57, leaking microbial antigens and endotoxins into circulation in acute binge drinking models58. In humans, long term drinking has been associated with higher serum endotoxin levels, which increase in a dose-dependent manner55. Similarly, we have recently reported a dose-dependent increased in the levels of circulating IgM-bound endotoxin levels in the animals used in this study45. It is, however, still unclear if ethanol-induced leakage of microbial antigens reprograms the bone marrow to influence hematopoiesis or acts on circulating immune cells. Aberrant activation of myeloid precursor cells would suggest that the effects of heavy drinking on the immune system are both long-term and irreversible.",

To begin to address this question, we investigated the transcriptional response to LPS stimulation. RNA-Seq measurements in PBMC from control animals at 16 hours post stimulation indicate activation of canonical inflammatory pathways associated with an LPS response such as cytokine signaling and innate immune response; and regulatory mechanisms such as mRNA catabolism, translation, and apoptosis. In contrast, responses in CHD animals indicate down-regulation of several genes involved in leukocyte differentiation, wound healing, and cytokine signaling. These observations are suggestive of a resolution phase. This scenario is corroborated by up-regulation of IL10, essential for a strong anti-inflammatory response59, in CHD animals only (Fig. 5d). It is possible that a heightened activation state of resting PBMC from CHD prevents them from further up-regulating expression of canonical pathways essential for the LPS response, suggestive of an immune tolerant phenotype.",

We have previously shown that ethanol sensitive miRNAs explain vaccine induced gene expression changes in PBMC44. In this study, we report changes in expression of mature and precursor miRNA molecules, which have validated roles in LPS signaling (miR-21, miR-29, miR-211, and miR-204)60,61. miR-204, for example, is a negative regulator of TLR4 signaling62 through its target JAK2. Decreased expression of miR-204 with CHD correlates with enhanced pro-inflammatory phenotype observed with CHD post LPS63. However, the small number of miRNA detected in this study strongly suggest that these mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation may not represent the primary mode by which ethanol alters immune cell functions, at least following ex vivo LPS stimulation. In addition to post-transcriptional mechanisms, ethanol has been shown to impact transcriptional mechanisms in the CNS at the genomic level, such as chromatin remodeling64\u201366 and DNA methylation67,68. Future work will focus on identifying changes in chromatin accessibility; patterns of histone methylation and acetylation in purified monocytes and DC subsets to better understand ethanol\u2019s impact on immune function.",
