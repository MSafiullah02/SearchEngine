On April 29th, after receiving from the WHO information on the recommended primer for nucleic acid detection, the IVDC promptly made comparisons with a variety of seasonal influenza viruses, synthesized the primer sequence needed for detection, and prepared the first-generation nucleic acid detection reagent for the human Influenza A (H1N1) virus-which was distributed to 84 influenza monitoring laboratories across the country on the night of April 30th. And on May 1st, the first phase of training on influenza monitoring laboratories focusing on port-based cities began, and immigration inspection and quarantine personnel were trained later on. Also, through the WHO, the CNIC provided fourteen countries including Cuba, Mongolia, Vietnam, and Macao with the independently developed testing kit and provided training for their personnel.",

When its emergency center received a patient with a fever from an epidemic-stricken region on the afternoon of May 9th, the hospital was able to immediately transfer the patient to a fever clinic via an isolation passage, and took proper protective measures pursuant to their response plans; the patient was determined to be China's first Influenza A (H1N1) case, confirmed by the hospital's clinical experts, epidemiological experts from CDCs, as well as by laboratory test results.",

After the national prevention and control strategy was adjusted, four ministries including the MOH and the MOF jointly issued a document on expenses for Influenza A (H1N1) treatment, requiring that expenses for cases which hospitals had received and treated be settled by local governments, and those cases yet to be received and treated would be solved through the urban employee insurance, the urban resident insurance, and the new rural cooperative medical care system. Nevertheless, many issues arose during the document's implementation, and some provinces still have not solved the issue of expenses that designated hospitals shouldered. 45% of the surveyed hospitals did not receive government subsidies, nearly 70% bore the medical costs themselves, and 84% paid medical expenses for patients. Because medical treatment of seriously ill cases were quite expensive and in some cases could cost up to tens of thousands of RMB for a single patient, those who were not medically insured could not afford it and became indebted to that hospital. Surveys found that 26 hospitals combined paid 14,235,500 RMB in medical expenses, averaging 550,000 RMB per hospital. While bearing the loss of expenses paid in treating Influenza A (H1N1) patients, hospitals faced economic losses from the decrease in outpatients revenue. This in turn put great pressure on their survival and development, an issue particularly prominent in less developed regions of central and western China. Moreover, treatment of severely ill cases was costly, involving the use of protective equipment that was not covered by medical insurance, which resulted in many patients becoming unwilling or unable to pay for their treatment. As some Influenza A (H1N1) patients were of the floating population, problems in medical insurance settlement between different regions kept springing up. There was no definitive policy as to the financial channel, responsibility, procedure, and time limits of compensation to the designated hospitals for expenses they paid in transportation, treatment, and living costs when treating Influenza A (H1N1) patients.",

With participation of the MIIT, MOF, MOT, MOR, MOC, MOH, AQSIQ, CAAC, and CFDA, the support group established a liaison mechanism and began preparing for vaccine development and supply. According to the Work Plan for the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism against Influenza A (H1N1), the support group was charged with managing affairs regarding vaccine supply and demand, production, stockpiling, transport, and the coordination and allocation of special funds. The Science and Technology Group was tasked with coordinating and addressing scientific and technological issues in vaccine development and application, and the Healthcare Group was in charge of formulating and revising technical plans for disease prevention and control, including national vaccination planning. In addition, the Expert Committee was to oversee major scientific issues related to vaccination. Such an emergency vaccine support mechanism achieved linear emergency response coordination for the development, production, stockpiling, and application of a normal vaccine supply system (Fig. 5.5 ). . On July 22nd, more than 13,000 volunteers in seven provinces were inoculated against Influenza A (H1N1) in the world's largest clinical vaccination trial. On August 2nd, ten Chinese vaccine manufacturers completed first-injection inoculation and serum specimen collection in seven clinics, with 12,868 people inoculated or given placebos. Observations of first-injection inoculations found no occurrences of serious side effects or incidents, and preliminary analysis showed that the Influenza A (H1N1) vaccine produced by China was safe and reliable. On August 21st, China made a global announcement that within two weeks of the vaccination, over 80% of antibodies tested positive, which demonstrated that one single injection could be enough-compared to two injections recommended by the WHO-which meant a considerable reduction in vaccine production. Trial results also demonstrated for the first time that the vaccine, after administered, manifested itself as an antigenic determinant (this was later proved by American and European scientists), indicating that case fatality rates for Influenza A (H1N1) would not be too high. The MOH and the MOST co-launched \"Emergency Research Projects for Joint Prevention and Control of Influenza A (H1N1),\" which apart from the development of rapid testing kits, included the following: evaluation and development of biological protective equipment and disinfectant products, the evaluation and development of medications, the investigation into the virus' genetic background, the evaluation of cross-protection effects of Chinese natural immunity and the seasonal influenza vaccination, the development of key technologies used to increase capacity of influenza vaccine manufacturers, the evaluation of clinical treatment methods, and the research on case resource integration.

The occurrence of coincidental incidents and serious unusual side effects from mass vaccination is unavoidable; such cases were mostly incidental, followed by anaphylactic shock which caused death due as treatment was unavailable in time. During the same period, fatalities from the vaccination were reported in several countries, including five deaths in both the United States and Sweden, one in Hungary, two in Norway, and one in Israel.",

Some websites published articles attributing the mid-November Influenza A (H1N1) outbreak in Beijing to the vaccination of primary and secondary school students; foreign media also reported the growing distrust the public expressed in the vaccines. According to results of a nationwide questionnaire, the ratio of respondents willing to be vaccinated to those unwilling to do so was at 4:1 in August 2009, which then plummeted to 1:1 in November; meanwhile the rate of respondents unwilling to be vaccinated for safety reasons rose from 15 to 50%. In early December 2009, it was reported that nine children diagnosed with Influenza A (H1N1) in Shenzhen were found to have brain damage, which sparked a public debate as to \"when to fight the virus and when to get vaccinated.\" There were multiple factors to this problem. Firstly, government leaders in some regions expressed suspicion of vaccine safety, and at the same time they worried that too much advertising could cause a vaccine shortage, which would make their vaccination arrangements appear inadequate. Secondly, some provinces didn't specify targets in their vaccination plans and instead simply distributed vaccines equally, making it difficult for local departments to select targets for the vaccination and hence compounding organization of the program. Thirdly, failure to clarify compensation for local workers engaged in the vaccination program was demotivating and the objective was not conducive to effective promotion of the vaccine. Moreover, media coverage of individual deaths from vaccination, coupled with unfavorable comments from well-known experts on the safety of the vaccines, and some home and foreign manufacturers' acts of recalling problematic vaccines, produced certain psychological effects on the general public. Risk communication in the early phases of the epidemic mobilized the public and projected confidence in \"preventing, controlling, and curing\" the virus, which in turn made the vaccination look unnecessary. Risk communication that followed was so inadequate that the public lost all confidence in the program and some even expressed an \"anything that is free can't be good\" mentality. Therefore, issues such as how to strengthen public affairs and risk communication, how to stress the pertinence and flexibility of vaccination programs, and how to avoid the awkward situations such as \"people with access to vaccination don't want to be vaccinated, and people who want to be vaccinated have no access vaccination,\" are all worth further reflection.",

The particularities of the vaccine industry mean it can neither be monopolized by the government nor be left to liberal market competition; a government monopoly could lead to low efficiency, and liberal market competition is not in the interest of the country's security and social justice strategies. Presently, both national policies that encourage influenza vaccine research and development, and policies on financial compensation to vaccine manufacturers, are flawed in some way or another. Research capacity, development, and vaccine production against new subtypes or new strains are still not up to par, which poses a barrier to the early supply of vaccines against new influenza viruses. Vaccine application strategies and strategies regarding targeted priority groups also need refinement. At the same time, vaccine manufacturers should be encouraged to pursue influenza vaccine development and capacity building as part of their social responsibilities. Departments all over the country need be more active in their vaccine supply efforts. It is important to note the duty of the government at various levels to fund vaccine storage and inoculation which in turn will greatly help less developed regions establish dynamic influenza vaccine storage systems, and help craft reasonable plans for the allocation of influenza vaccines. Surveys found that as of the summer of 2010, that local governments still had roughly 50 million doses of Influenza A (H1N1) vaccines in stock, and some regions and departments saw those unused vaccines as \"a loss,\" a sentiment that was shared across the board by many others.",

Firstly, the Administrative Measures for National Drug Stockpiling, which was enacted in 1999, needs revision based on public health emergency situations as well as on adjustments in departmental functions. According to the Administrative Measures for National Drug Stockpiling and related contingency plans, national drug stockpiling takes place at both central and local levels. For national-level stockpiling, the MOH provides recommendations on the content and amount for stockpiling based on actual demand, and the NDRC (it is now the MIIT that oversees drug stockpiling) then consults the MOF to make funds available.

When health emergency needs arose, these health departments directly requested the MOH to draw on the national strategic stockpile, even though their emergencies didn't reach the level that necessitated the use of the national stockpile.

Some local governments and departments stated that the population proportion needed for vaccination stockpiling was mostly based on officials' speeches, but whether these standards were adequate, scientific, and authoritative merits further discussion. At the same time, guidelines on drug and material stockpiling should be adjusted based upon epidemic trends. In regards to the stockpiling of drugs, provinces stockpiled general items on the drug list for the national stockpile, but procedures and regulations for government procurement in a state of emergency were lacking. The five regions surveyed suggested two-stage decision-making for emergency drug stockpiling: firstly, expert evaluations are performed; secondly, health departments could then determine the size of stockpiles, and in consultation with related departments, propose appropriate stockpiles according to capabilities of provinces and cities. On the same token stockpiling materials used in public health emergencies should have robust reporting and management mechanisms regarding the amounts and types of materials, and specific principles for the allocation of funds. During the process of Influenza A (H1N1) prevention and control, problems emerged for local stockpiles of materials such as antiviral drugs, with few varieties and inadequate amounts. Though the use of Tamiflu in the early stages of Influenza A (H1N1) proved effective, in the early days of prevention and control only provincial-level health departments stockpiled small amounts of the drug, which was then allocated on a unified basis after epidemic break out. There were only 500,000 doses of Tamiflu and a very limited amount of N95 masks in the national stockpile before the Influenza A (H1N1) outbreak. Only 37,900 doses of Tamiflu were locally stored, according to the National Questionnaire on Material and Manpower Preparedness for Influenza A (H1N1), which the MOH Health Emergency Office conducted in early May of 2009 among health departments. Considering the shortage of materials in the national stockpile at that time, the MOH and the MIIT tightened the use of Tamiflu from the national stockpile. Moreover, the relationship between capacity building and material stockpiling needs strengthening, the drug bidding system needs improvement so that it matches the drug stockpiling system and guarantees that drugs and equipment to be stockpiled are safe. As for financial compensation for drugs, a regular claim system linked with stockpiling funds should be established. There should be a supporting system governing drug rotation, and both the central and local governments should move on to create a stronger stockpile system through collaboration between the government, market and the society, which would shed more light on capacity building and cyclical stockpiling.",

Upon receiving an epidemic alert from the WHO, the Chinese government placed it as a top priority and began coping with new epidemic challenges in an orderly and organized manner. This included the following actions: providing the public with information on Influenza A (H1N1) situations abroad through press releases, media coverage, and interviews with experts; describing the virus' features and transmission mediums as well as potential preventive measures; and projecting a knowledgeable and authoritative voice to the public in the early phases of the epidemic. In this stage, related departments' publicity and communication efforts made through various channels and forms, enabled people in having a basic understanding of Influenza A (H1N1) and spurred the public to take preventative actions against it. This timely initiative in risk communication was conducive to raising public awareness of the virus and acted as a warning for the public.",

In response, related departments took swift action: On May 11th, i.e. a day after the first case was reported, related departments held a press conference briefing the media about the possible route of transmission of the first case, its diagnosis and treatment, epidemiological survey outcomes, etc. While stressing the importance of self-protection and a reasonable attitude towards the virus, the public was also told that more cases could emerge; meanwhile, experts and related professionals were requested to provide scientific, authoritative, and comprehensive knowledge about disease prevention and control, in an effort to reduce public fear and guide the people to employing rational treatments. Of course, sensationalized reporting from some news sources after early cases began to emerge may also have intensified the public's uneasiness. This suggests that proper guidance of the media and public opinion is crucial for risk communication.",

At the onset of the epidemic, the MOH in collaboration with the China CDC, organized a risk communication team of experts on epidemiology, emergency disease control, vaccine research and development, and international relations, to ensure the timeliness, authoritativeness, and effectiveness of risk communication. After the epidemic continued for some time, fearing that people had become complacent in their own self-protection, the public was urged now and again to stay alert and employ scientific response actions. On August 31st, 2009, for example, the MOH, joined by related departments, launched an Influenza A (H1N1) Prevention and Control Initiative, which was widely promoted through multiple channels.

New dissemination methods and communication platforms also pose unique challenges for publicity and dissemination. Influential news media should take the brunt of the responsibility in coping with public health emergencies. Survey results show that related health and disease control departments expected the news media to take on as much information dissemination tasks as possible while performing their normal duties in the case of a public health emergency. There was also the expectation for related departments to come forward and coordinate with the media during public health emergencies by providing potential scenarios or phases of the epidemic, to enable the rapid and widespread dissemination of relevant prevention and control information Mainstream media represented by central media such as People's Daily, Xinhua News Agency, China Central Television (CCTV), and China National Radio (CNR) leveraged their traditional and irreplaceable advantages in dealing with the Influenza A (H1N1) Epidemic. It must be noted, however, with the recent emergence of the internet as a representative of commercial portals and other new sources, reporting and public opinion on related events-especially public health emergencies-have diversified and enriched the channels and methods by which people receive information. That being said, this diversification also presents unprecedented challenges in the work of publicity and opinion guidance.

Discrepancies in risk communication capabilities between central and local governments still exist, and in some cases, the differences are staggering. There was also inadequate communication content, forms, and channels (multi-dimensional) that were tailored (focused) and familiar to different groups of people. In addition, the \"social mobilization\" risk communication model produced some negative results. The exaggerations at the start of the epidemic about the situation abroad caused unnecessary panic. Some medical workers surveyed felt that there may have been an over-projection of confidence by prematurely declaring Influenza A (H1N1) \"preventable, controllable and curable\" in early May 2009, when not much was known of the virus, nor was there any rigorous scientific proof supporting that claim. These findings merit discussion.

To prevent the epidemic from spreading to China, related government departments tightened entry measures according to regulations, including: suspending flights from Mexico, placing passengers entering China under quarantine, and tightening visa policies towards epidemic-stricken countries. These measures bought precious time for the country to judge epidemic situations and prepare for it. However, misunderstandings and dissatisfaction among some foreign governments and people about China's related measures did emerge. In response to this, foreign affairs departments took a series of powerful, organized, and effective actions to communicate with these groups, and managed to resolve conflicts and yield positive results.",

Though Chinese authorities communicated frequently with their Mexican counterparts, misunderstanding still arose in Mexico and elsewhere. In response, related Chinese ministries and embassies made concerted efforts-including multi-party communication and cooperation-to clarify the situation and strengthen cooperation. On July 2nd, 2009, Health Minister Chen Zhu, with his delegation, participated in a high-level meeting on global Influenza A (H1N1) prevention and control held in Canc\u00fan, Mexico, at which meeting he profiled China's epidemic situation and response measures, and garnered support from the participants. Through painstaking efforts, the unfavorable effects caused by suspending Mexican flights were successfully mitigated.",

Therefore, the government and related departments, from the beginning, ensured careful and considerate arrangements were made. Living conditions for foreigners quarantined in China was a top priority, and standards and procedures were formulated to ensure their stay was as comfortable as possible. All related departments properly handled isolation and observation measures in accordance with the law, and provided foreigners with scientific diagnoses, living necessities, and ensured the patients were properly cared for. Meanwhile, strengthening information reporting mechanisms and channels between local foreign affairs departments and related central departments was high on the list of priorities, and related countries were informed at the earliest possible time of their nationals quarantined in China. This was to ensure smooth operations and to minimize possible adverse effects.",

On June 8th, Ray Nagin, Mayor of New Orleans, was placed under quarantine in Shanghai after a suspected case was found on his flight.
