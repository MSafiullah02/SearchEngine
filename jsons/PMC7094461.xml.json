Once the reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR test became available, either a throat or nasopharyngeal swab was obtained from patients with suspected or probable SARS for detection of SARS-CoV RNA.4\n5 The extraction of viral RNA (TRIzol; Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA) was performed in a laminar-flow cabinet in a biosafety level-3 laboratory. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed with random hexamers (ABgene; Epsom, Surrey, UK). The reactions contained 12.5 \u03bcL buffer concentrate, 3.6 mmol/L magnesium sulfate, 0.5 \u03bcL each primer, 0.5 \u03bcL RT/Taq DNA polymerase mixture, and 5 \u03bcL RNA in a total volume of 25 \u03bcL. The complementary DNA was amplified successively with three pairs of primers, including IN-6/IN-7, Cor-p-F2/Cor-p-R1, and Cor-p-F3/Cor-p-R2. First, a 440-nucleotide segment of open reading frame 1b of the CoV polymerase gene was amplified with the broadly reactive genus-specific primer pair IN-6 (+) 5\u2032GGTTGGGACTATCCTAAGTGTGA3\u2032 and IN-7 (-) 5\u2032CCATCATCAGATAGAATCATCATA3\u2032. The amplified complementary DNA then was subjected to nested PCR using the SARS-specific primer pair Cor-p-F2 (+) 5\u2032CTAACATGCTTAGGATAATGG3\u2032 and Cor-p-R1 (-) 5\u2032CAGGTAAGCGTAAAACTCATC3\u2032. The size of the nested product was 368 base pairs (bp). Drosten et al4 reported that the number of copies of SARS-CoV RNA in the throat was much lower than that in the sputum. Therefore, in order to further improve the sensitivity of nested RT-PCR for the throat samples, we amplified the nested products with a second nested PCR using the SARS-specific primer pair Cor-p-F3 (+) 5\u2032GCCTCTCTTGTTCTTGCTCGC3\u2032 and Cor-p-R2 (-) 5\u2032CCTATTTCTATAGAGACACTC3\u2032. The size of the final product was 348 bp. Thermal cycling was performed at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 45 s, and 40 cycles of 72\u00b0C for 7 min. The specificity of the RT-PCR reaction was confirmed by sequencing the positive RT-PCR-amplified products by agarose gel electrophoretic separation. This procedure required about 6 to 8 h, and the patient had to be isolated while awaiting the results. Given the large number of people in this category, it was clear that a more rapid procedure was needed.",

Plasmids with the target sequence were used to generate the standard curve. The fragment was cloned and transcribed into complementary DNA.

Once the clinical presentation fulfilled the case definition for either suspect or probable SARS, the patient was admitted to a negative-pressure isolation room, if available, or to an isolation room in the ICU. The SARS treatment protocol was begun with the oral administration of ribavirin (2,000 mg immediately and 600 mg twice daily for 10 days). If the patient did not improve following 2 days of ribavirin therapy, corticosteroids were administered, starting with IV methylprednisolone at a dose of 1 mg/kg every 8 h for 5 days, then every 12 h for 5 days, followed by oral prednisolone tapered over > 11 days.19 If fever persisted and lung infiltrates or oxygenation worsened after 2 days of standard methylprednisolone therapy, the patient was given pulse methylprednisolone, 500 mg twice daily for 3 days, and/or IV Ig, 1 mg/kg for 2 days.

The remaining 13 patients had a typical clinical course and were clearly linked in a chain of transmission by a history of close contact with a SARS patient and/or evidence of transmission to another patient in whom SARS was subsequently diagnosed. These 13 patients included 7 with a negative PCR finding and 6 others in whom PCR was not performed. The latter group included both staff and patients from the hospital in which significant local transmission initially occurred in Taiwan. No PCR test was available at that time. Thirteen of the 53 patients (25%) were health-care workers (HCWs), 21 patients (42%) had visited hospitals where SARS patients had been treated, 11 patients (21%) had community contact with SARS patients, 1 patient (2%) had traveled to Vietnam, and 7 patients (13%) had an unclear contact history. All patients in the last group had a typical clinical course, and most had a positive PCR finding. There were seven clusters involving family members of 17 patients. Four women were pregnant.

Both had histories of cough and dyspnea, one due to COPD and the other due to congestive heart failure. All of the other patients experienced several days of high fever before developing respiratory symptoms. This suggests that, in the absence of an underlying cardiopulmonary disease, patients presenting with a cough that precedes or is concurrent with a high fever are less likely to have SARS. Pharyngitis is a symptom that is common to other CoV infections.29 It occurred in one fourth of our patients. Other CoVs rarely have hepatic involvement,29 but elevated liver enzyme levels were present in half our patients, although without jaundice or serious decline in liver function. Abdominal complaints, including loose stools and pain, were also common (66% of patients). However, these symptoms began only after the onset of a high fever. Fever to this degree is less common in other viral infections that cause similar symptoms. Therefore, it appears that strict isolation may not be necessary for patients who do not have fever as the first symptom of a respiratory illness, assuming that they do not have an underlying disease that causes similar respiratory symptoms.",

One of the latter had a tension pneumothorax and died of acute respiratory failure. None of our own staff died. The other hospital was the site of the first major local transmission of SARS on Taiwan. None of the seven nurses from that hospital had been wearing a complete PPE,16\n22 in contrast to the six members of our staff who became infected. It may be that the use of protective equipment, including N95 masks, goggles, and gowns, lessened the viral load in the initial inoculum, perhaps accounting for the good outcome in our six staff members. This suggestion is further supported by the fact that four of our infected staff members had a negative PCR finding for SARS. Their clinical courses and chest radiograph findings, however, were totally consistent with SARS, and none had evidence of any other infection that could explain their illness. It is noteworthy that these four patients had experienced low-grade fevers for 1 or 2 days before the onset of high fever. Wearing full protective equipment, they continued to care for patients for that period, as they did not fulfill the criteria in use at that time for isolation.22 (They were immediately isolated when their temperatures rose to > 38\u00b0C.) There is no evidence that they transmitted SARS to anyone else, again suggesting that the protective equipment is successful in limiting the spread of the virus.",

The relatively low sensitivity could result from differences in viral load, sampling methods and accuracy, or timing. Once the results of antibody testing are available, we will be in a better position to assess the characteristics of PCR. It will also be important to review the course of the disease in other groups of patients with confirmed SARS to see whether a similar pattern can be discerned. We also need to compare this pattern of onset with other types of atypical pneumonia to determine whether there are features that will adequately distinguish SARS.",
