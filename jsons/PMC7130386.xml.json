Although community-acquired infection and household transmission have been reported, in a significant number of cases in 2003, transmission of SARS-CoV was nosocomial and was from SARS-infected patients to health care workers in charge of their care.2., 3., 4., 5., 14., 15. In most of these cases, nosocomial transmission occurred in medical facilities in which infection control precautions were lax or were not practiced.14 In addition, SARS-CoV may be transmitted by direct contact with infected respiratory secretions and other body fluids.7., 15., 16., 19. Indirect contact with contaminated environmental surfaces and inanimate objects (fomites) is suspected to have resulted in the transmission of SARS-CoV, as suggested by reports that health care workers who had no direct contact with SARS-infected patients became infected.5., 6., 9., 15., 16. Data suggest that SARS-CoV can survive on hard surfaces, such as plastic and stainless steel, for several hours, if not days.9., 12., 16. Furthermore, it appears that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.12., 19.\n",

            "text": "Based on experience with SARS to date, as well as recommendations for prevention of transmission of other disease-causing agents, e.g., hepatitis C, a number of steps can be taken to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV in the GI endoscopy unit and other health care settings:\u2022A program should be established for identification and isolation of patients who are suspected or likely to have SARS.5., 19. Prompt diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection is crucial for the prevention of transmission of the disease.2 Screening and evaluation of patients for SARS should be based on the current case definition of SARS as established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States. During a known SARS outbreak, a high index of suspicion for infection is warranted.5 The current CDC definition (dated January 8, 2004) of a suspect case and a probable case of SARS can be found in the document entitled \u201cUpdated interim U.S. case definition for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),\u201d which can be read at the following web link: http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/casedefinition.htm\n\u2022Health care workers must be educated with respect to the following principles: infection control, standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne precautions for both suspect and probable SARS-infected patients.3., 6., 19., 20., 21., 22., 23. Steps should be taken to ensure that health care workers properly and diligently practice these important principles, because failure to understand and use each one of them may significantly increase the risk of nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV. In addition to eye protection, personal protective equipment should be used, including gloves, gowns, and both head and shoe covers.13., 16., 24., 25. Adherence to airborne precautions requires that health care workers be fitted with disposable respirators certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health as N95 or better,14 which, unlike surgical masks,5., 26. appear to prevent transmission of SARS. Placement of a SARS-infected patient in an isolated room with negative air pressure also is recommended. Proper hand hygiene and frequent hand washing with soap and water (or an alcohol-based hand rub) are essential, both before and after each patient contact.13., 14., 19., 26., 27., 28. The contribution of hand washing to the prevention of transmission of SARS (and other infectious agents) cannot be overstated.16 After each patient contact, gloves should be removed and hands washed thoroughly; the use of gloves does not eliminate the need for proper hand hygiene and frequent hand washing. Proper disposal of used gloves is also essential. A surveillance program to monitor and to evaluate compliance with these principles and precautions is advisable.\u2022Bronchoscopy, airway suctioning, and other types of procedures that may induce coughing and thereby expose health care workers to potentially infected aerosolized respiratory droplets should be performed with caution on SARS-infected patients and then only when deemed a medical necessity.7., 20., 21.\n\u2022GI endoscopes, bronchoscopes, and other flexible endoscopes and ancillary endoscopic equipment should be thoroughly cleaned and subjected to either high-level disinfection or sterilization as required. Whereas high-level disinfection is recommended for GI endoscopes, bronchoscopes, and other \u201csemicritical\u201d instruments, sterilization is recommended for \u201ccritical\u201d instruments, including biopsy forceps, papillotomes, and polypectomy snares. Single, disposable endoscopic accessories and devices are an alternative to sterilization of reusable devices; proper disposal of these devices also is essential. Adherence to current guidelines for reprocessing of endoscopes also is recommended for prevention of transmission of SARS-CoV via both potentially contaminated GI endoscopes and bronchoscopes.\u2022Rooms occupied by SARS-infected patients, as well as other areas in a medical facility that may be visited by SARS-infected patients (e.g., the emergency room), should be cleaned and disinfected once per day or more often, as required. Routine and terminal cleaning and disinfection of all necessary bedside equipment, furniture, floors, and other environmental surfaces, particularly surfaces that are touched frequently, are recommended.13., 19., 29. For these purposes, any Environmental Protection Agency registered hospital-grade detergent-disinfectant shown to be effective against coronaviruses is suitable. The label instructions on the product for use and dilution (i.e., concentration), contact time, and care in handling should be followed carefully.29 Although the role of environmental surfaces in the transmission of SARS-CoV is not fully defined, contamination of such surfaces has been reported, suggesting that intensive environmental cleaning and disinfection are essential for both control and prevention of the spread of SARS-CoV.16\n\n",
