Academic scientists are uniquely positioned to shape such opportunities long before the university spin-off is founded. To better understand how science-based university spin-offs can be endowed for success, the pre-formation stage of 30 ventures co-founded over a 40 year period by a star-scientist-entrepreneur is analysed by matching his 363 co-invented US patents granted to 1476 co-authored publications and these 30 ventures. Employing the extended case method, including the analysis of extensive archival data, iterative interviews, and this unique, longitudinal, multi-level dataset, existing dynamic capabilities theory is confronted and extended with evidence as to how a star-scientist-entrepreneur senses and shapes and seizes opportunities to endow university spin-offs pre-formation. A process model is developed depicting four pre-formation entrepreneurial capabilities with which these science-based university spin-offs are endowed for success. Recommendations are made for scientistentrepreneurs, investors, university leadership, and for innovation policymakers.",

While scholars have noted that the location and growth of science-based ventures can be linked to the presence of highly productive academic scientists (Maine et al., 2014a; Zucker et al., 1998) , the process by which scientists endow university spin-offs remains unknown. And, though understudied, the entrepreneurial capabilities of scientists are much maligned. In fact some scholars have cast doubts on whether scientists should play a leading role in the commercialization of science through spin-off formation (Gurdon and Samsom, 2010; Stuart and Ding, 2006; Vohora et al., 2004) . This study is motivated by the research question: How can scientist-entrepreneurs endow university spin-offs pre-formation?",

A process model of entrepreneurial capabilities leading to the emergence of 30 science-based university spin-offs is developed. An exemplar SSE was identified as an outlier (Fig. 1) based on the 30 science-based university spin-offs he had co-founded, their level of success, and after initial data collection showed that his career patenting output exceeded most firms in the emerging nanobiotechnology industry. The research leading to the formation of a science-based university spin-off may precede the founding of the venture by a decade or more. Thus, although the first spin-off co-founded by the focal scientist-entrepreneur was formed in 1987, extensive data including papers, patents, and ventures with the scientist as a co-author, co-inventor, and cofounder was gathered for the period 1974-2014, allowing for a longitudinal examination of the progression of science from research laboratory to science-based university spin-off.",

The patent-paper-venture matching provided objective data on the timeline from invention to spin-off formation, through analysing and linking patents to their associated papers and spin-off ventures. Interviews and secondary sources provided evidence on technology-market matching -a key sensing and shaping capability -which was then anchored in time via patent-paper-venture matching to the corresponding seizing capabilities. A method was developed to identify platform technologies from papers, along with a technique to identify matched patents which were broad, blocking, and relevant (Maine and Thomas, 2017) . Data on the founding and financing of ventures was sourced from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, archived documents, company reports, and press releases (see appendix 1). The entrepreneurial capabilities leading to well-endowed science-based university spin-off emergence were verified and refined through interviews with the scientist-entrepreneur, senior personnel at the MIT Technology Licensing Office (TLO), a lab alumni and academic co-founder, a business co-founder identified and nurtured by the scientist-entrepreneur, a venture capitalist who was also CEO of a co-founded spin-off, and an IP counsel of a co-founded spin-off (see appendix 2).",

            "text": "This study contributes to the academic entrepreneurship and dynamic capabilities literatures in several important ways. First, through the extended case method, detailed evidence of the commercialization activities of a star-scientist-entrepreneur is used to confront and extend dynamic capabilities theory to the individual level pre-formation (Table 1 & Fig. 2) . Consistent with existing dynamic capabilities theory (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000; Helfat and Petraf, 2015; Teece, 2007; Teece et al., 1997) both a sensing and shaping capability as well as seizing capabilities are observed at the firm-level. Extending dynamic capabilities theory, at the individual level the key pre-formation sensing and shaping capability of technology-market matching and the pre-formation seizing capabilities of claiming and protecting IP, attracting and mentoring the founding team, and strategic timing are identified and elucidated. A process model of these four entrepreneurial capabilities which lead to well-endowed science-based university spin-offs is developed, identifying the role of the scientist-entrepreneur, his academic collaborators, the university's technology licensing office, and the external environment. Second, the novel method of patent-paper-venture matching is developed which enables a detailed longitudinal examination of the processes of science commercialization from the flow of research outputs and personnel from the lab to the emergence of science-based university spinoffs. Through this method, we reveal how the coordination, sequencing, and timing of commercialization decisions by the SSE (along with his collaborators and the TLO), helps prepare the nascent venture in the pre-formation and early post-formation stages of venture emergence. Third, this research adds to the growing literature on science-based entrepreneurship by providing empirical evidence and longitudinal analysis of the emergence and performance of 30 science-based university spin-offs. In doing so, a nuanced perspective on a crucial and understudied period in the lifecycle of science-based university spin-offs (Druilhe and Garnsey, 2004; Phan, 2004; Rasmussen, 2011) is provided. From this analysis, we offer recommendations for scientist-entrepreneurs, investors, university leadership, and policymakers to further facilitate the commercialization of university science.",

This mechanism is particularly important for the commercialization of breakthrough technologies which have the potential to create new industries or transform existing ones. Though the importance of this phenomena of university spin-off emergence is broadly recognized, extant studies have concentrated at the macro/ institutional level leading to the critique that the micro-level remains understudied (Fuller and Rothaermel, 2012; Siegel and Wright, 2015) . Moreover, the vast majority of the academic entrepreneurship literature examines university spin-offs post-formation (Mustar et al., 2006; Rothaermel et al. 2007 ). Yet much remains unknown. For example, though it is well recognized that academic scientists are the key decision makers developing the technology and shaping the commercialization strategy in the very early stages with the technology having been developed in their scientific lab (Jain et al., 2009; Krabel and Mueller, 2009; Perkmann et al., 2013) , further elucidation is needed to understand how scientists can endow university spin-offs for success.",

The lack of such endowments result in most university spin-offs failing within a decade of founding (Dimov and De Clerq, 2006; Timmons, 1990) . Few science-based university spinoffs succeed in raising substantial VC financing or reaching an initial pubic offering (IPO) (Fini et al., 2018; Maine and Thomas, 2017) . Highly productive scientists are thus at an advantage in being able to attract much needed resources to these spin-offs through their reputation and signalling effects (Stuart and Ding, 2006) . Highly productive scientists have also been labelled \"elite\" or \"stars\" and several scholars have shown that such scientists contribute disproportionately to the discovery of scientific inventions from universities (Baba et al., 2009; Lotka, 1926; Zucker et al., 1998) . This productivity has led them to be identified in several ways: having an above average level of productivity in generating scientific publications and patents (Baba et al., 2009; Lawson and Sterzi, 2014; Schiffauerova and Beaudry, 2011; Subramanian et al., 2013) , being Nobel prize winners (Higgins et al., 2011), or having identified and characterized specific DNA sequences (Zucker et al., 1998 (Zucker et al., & 2002 .",

While researchers have made significant progress in identifying the antecedents, moderators and mechanisms leading to firm performance, much work remains (Schilke et al., 2018) . The predominant focus of most studies on dynamic capabilities has been at the firm-level. While this focus is essential, valuable insights can also be gained by examining individual-level capabilities (Felin et al., 2012; Helfat and Petraf, 2015) . This emphasis on individual-level capabilities is particularly important in the pre-formation stage of new ventures because \"it is entrepreneurs who bring agency to opportunity\", Shane (2003) , by sensing, shaping and seizing opportunities.",

Pathdependent decisions on key elements of science commercialization such as intellectual property (IP), founding team, and target markets are taken during this stage. For example, the quality of patent protection achieved pre-formation and the manner in which the patents are licensed out by the inventors and their institutions impact the ability of the licensee science-based venture to commercialize the technology. Academic scientists from whose research labs these inventions emerge, are important stakeholders in the pre-formation stage. While extant researchers have suggested that most academic scientists are neither well-suited nor trained for science commercialization (Gurdon and Samsom, 2010) , a few outlier star-scientist-entrepreneurs have emerged. Their unusual success in co-founding a large number of science-based university spinoffs can shed light on the entrepreneurial capabilities they possess and enrich the dynamic capabilities framework.",

However, the pre-formation stage is where critical decisions which affect the future success of the spin-off may be taken by the scientist and his or her academic collaborators (Druilhe and Garnsey, 2004; Rasmussen, 2011; Rasmussen et al., 2011; Shane, 2004) .

Technology-market matching has predominantly happened post the formation of science-based ventures, and not in the labs of academic scientists (Maine and Garnsey, 2006; Maine et al., 2014a ). Yet, given the long timelines from invention to innovation and the large sums of capital involved, early-stage entrepreneurial capability in technology-market matching could be enormously beneficial. makes sense to select an \"extreme\" case when the phenomenon of interest is \"transparently observable\". The study of an exemplar is appropriate and valuable to develop or expand theories, particularly in contexts with evolving, complex processes and little primary data elucidating them (Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007; Yin, 2014) . Science commercialization is such a context (Fini et al., 2018) . The relationships uncovered through such in-depth, longitudinal and multilevel analyses of single case studies (i.e. Eisenhardt, 1996 & 2001; Murray, 2002) have proved invaluable in informing the metrics of subsequent quantitative studies.",

In studying the SSE, his lab and his co-founded spin-offs over 4 decades ( Table 2) , data on all of the papers and granted US patents with the star scientist as a co-author and co-inventor until 31st December 2014 are first gathered and then these patents are matched to the academic papers through a combination of extensive automated and manual matching. Papers which advanced a platform technology were identified, and the journal impact factors of publications were gathered from the Journal Citation Report 2012. Patents which were broad, blocking and relevant, were identified following the method outlined in section 3.2. Co-authored papers were identified from the Web of Science and also compared with the publication list on the lab website of the SSE (http://langer-lab.mit.edu/publications). After eliminating dual entries and errors, and accounting for any inconsistencies in the coverage of the Web of Science dataset, the total number of papers was 1476. All US patents issued between July 1979 and December 2014 with Robert S. Langer or Robert S. Langer Jr. as a co-inventor residing in Massachusetts were identified from the USPTO. In all, 363 US patents were identified and analysed through our patent-paper-matching technique (section 3.1).",

Matching patents and papers to ventures allows for a nuanced understanding of the progression of science from research laboratory to science-based university spin-off. Patents were matched to papers by first creating a list of the top 10 matched papers for each patent. To do so, for each co-authored patent, the year of patent filing was identified, a list of inventors from each patent was compiled, and co-authored papers that had been published in the +/-five year period from the patent filing date were identified. Next, the patent inventors were matched with the co-authors of the papers in this period. In many instances, multiple inventors were matched as co-authors on papers submitted and published within this period. The number of overlapping words between the titles and abstracts of the focal patent and the papers were also identified. Once the list of top 10 possible matched papers was generated through this technique, an overlap in the text and/or the figures in both sets of documents were manually verified, so that each patent could be accurately matched to the papers that inform it (Murray and Stern, 2007) .",

Inventions or discoveries of a new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or new and useful improvements in these categories, may be patented. The breadth of protection is determined through the patent claims, which define the scope of protection or the legal boundaries of the invention. Each patent can have two types of claims, independent and dependent. Independent claims stand alone and do not reference other claims within the patent. Dependent claims reference other claims, and can be considered as subsets of the claims on which they depend. The first claim in a patent is independent, defines the broadest scope of the patent protection (Huys et al., 2009) and is least restrictive (USPTO, 2015: MPEP \u00a7608.01(m)).",

Unlike in Europe, where the blocking nature of a patent can be inferred by the X and Y classification in the search reports of forward citing patents (Torrisi et al., 2016) , in the US no equivalent classification exists. Existing proxies for patent breadth, such as the number of IPC classes (Lerner, 1994) and the number of patent claims (Lanjouw and Schankerman, 2001) , also have drawbacks (Maine and Thomas, 2017; Reitzig, 2004) . To address this, the method described in Maine and Thomas (2017) was followed to identify broad, blocking and relevant patents in the US. First, the first 500 characters of the patent claims (the independent claim) were searched for the presence of the word \"comprising,\" which has been identified as an indicator of the broad nature of a patent (Radack, 1995) . This indicator was then combined with data on patent forward citations, as these citations are indicative of the cumulative development of the technology by the scientist, his collaborators, and competitors. The criteria used to identify broad, blocking, relevant patents was those patents which have the word \"comprising\" in the first 500 characters of the patent claims and have more than 10 forward citations within 10 years from patent issue date or more than 5 forward patent citations within 5 years of patent issue date.",

All ventures spun out of the lab of the SSE meet or are in the process of meeting the 10-year survival threshold, if acquisitions are included as survival ( Table 3 ). In contrast, most science-based university spin-offs are likely to fail within the first decade of founding (Dimov and De Clerq, 2006; Timmons, 1990) . As to financing, all but two of the ventures spun out of the lab of the SSE raised at least US$27 million in financing (Table 3) . Zhang (2009, Table 6 ) finds that, of those university spin-offs which raise venture capital, average total VC money raised is US$23.55 million, giving a comparison level for our data.

As he explained to Langer, he did this by modifying two of the mRNA's nucleotides, or building blocks. Once they breached the cells' defense mechanism, the mRNA reprogrammed the cells into IPS cells. That was the feat that got Rossi so much acclaim. But what most struck Langer as he listened to Rossi was the first part: the technique that Rossi had developed to modify the mRNA. \"This is a much bigger discovery than something that affects stem cell behavior,\" Langer told Rossi, already imagining the potential. \"You could apply it to make anything.\" (Elton, 2013) The formation of multiple ventures from a single platform technology is another form of technology-market matching, in this case leading from the technology, although the process is still iterative. As depicted in Figure 4 , the 30 spin-offs co-founded by this star scientist stem from 8 platform technologies. Most notably, he has co-founded 10 spin-offs over 25 years which draw on his platform technology of controlled release polymers. This technology is so broad that one firm has virtually no chance of tackling the entire breadth of value creation, and multiple ventures are formed even from sub-platforms. For example, following the development of controlled release nanoparticles (Gref et al., 1994) , the star scientist and his post-doctoral fellow, Omid Farokhzad, developed stealth nanoparticles which could bind to targeted sites to treat cancer. This led to the formation of BIND Therapeutics, Selecta Biosciences, and Blend",

In cases where the inventors are from multiple organizations, the MIT TLO often plays the role of the lead organization, coordinating negotiations with licensees and carefully licensing out pieces of the intellectual property by fields of use, with clauses indicating that the licence has to be returned in case commercialization milestones are not met within a specified timeframe (Appendix 2, interview 5). By ensuring that the technologies developed in the star scientist's lab and across MIT are protected by patents before public dissemination, the TLO is able to satisfy both the need for sharing new knowledge in scientific journals while at the same time maintaining strong property rights to incentivize commercialization.",

There are two notable exceptions: in the case of Living Proofa spin-off with no clinical trial hurdles and a competitive commercialization environment, the executive experience of the initial CEO comes from a cosmetics multinational corporation; in the case of AIR -it was acquired after only 2 years, and focused on scientific development during those first years. Thus, the university spin-off benefits from both the networks and experience of attracted venture capitalists and the initial CEOs, who facilitate alliance partnerships and investment.",

The SSE guides technology-market matching during project formulation and mentors lab members in understanding, evaluating, and mitigating the gap between successful experiments in the research lab and commercial viability. Pre-formation, technology-market matching begins unusually early -at the project formulation stage ( Table 2) . Next, the SSE repeatedly files broad, blocking, relevant patents at the earliest opportunity. These are coordinated in timing and context with elite publications ( Table 2 ). In contrast, the SSE co-founds the venture far later than might be expected ( Table 2) . Thus, the spin-offs from the lab of the SSE often have a prolonged gestation period within the university. During this gestation time, further technical goals are set and achieved, with additional journal publications and follow-on patent protection.",

Consistent with Murray (2010) The star-scientist-entrepreneur investigated in this study played a central role in claiming and protecting his inventions through publishing the results of his research in elite scientific journals while also protecting it with one or more broad, blocking patents prior to spin-off founding (Table 2, Figure 3) . In doing so, the star scientist and TLO create currency for the university spin-off in their subsequent quest to raise financing (Hsu and Ziedonis, 2008; Maine and Thomas, 2017) . Further, broad, blocking patents on platform technologies enable different spin-offs to simultaneously develop the technology for specific market applications, as one spin-off may not be able to commercialize all applications of a platform technology. This coordination enables broader value creation from platform technologies (Arora et al., 2001; Gambardella and McGahan, 2010) . Such practices reduce the holdup problem, particularly problematic with large incumbent firms, which can lose interest in in-licensed technologies (Langer, 2013) . Supporting the arguments of Al-Aali and Teece (2013), this case evidence demonstrates how the strategic management of IP can influence venture success, and suggests strategies which may be followed by other scientist-entrepreneurs and their university TLOs.",

Notably, spin-offs were more successful at raising financing when their initial CEOs had executive experience at a biopharma company ( Table 3) , suggesting that such managerial experience and social capital enable success in this sector. Such executives are not typically within the networks of academic scientists.",

We demonstrate the same is true in the case of nascent science-based ventures. The early timing of technology-market matching and of publications and patents, coupled with delayed spin-off formation by the star scientist and his collaborators, can give a positive ex ante signal to better align venture timelines and expectations with those of venture capital investors.

Table 2 depicts the gestation period (timing in years from grant of first blocking patent until firm formation) of each venture. This period is notably long as the SSE times patents and key papers as early as possible, and yet delays the formation of the venture. Post patenting, the assessment of when a science-based university spin-off is sufficiently endowed for the biomedical commercialization challenge involves dynamic assessment of technology and commercial viability (Arnaud, 2012; Gruber and Tal, 2017; Maine, Probert, and Ashby, 2005; Teece, 2012) , the readiness of a scientific-entrepreneur to lead further technological development within the firm (Clarysse and Moray, 2004) , and the fit of the remaining developmental timeline with venture capitalists' institutional logic and window for investment (Maine and Seegopaul, 2016; Maine and Thomas, 2017; Pahnke, Katila, and Eisenhardt, 2015) . During the longer gestation times, the SSE further develops the technology towards commercial viability, mentors scientific leadership for the eventual venture, and helps attract VCs. These are all aspects of the pre-formation entrepreneurial capability of strategic timing. For those ventures spun out of the lab of the SSE which had longer gestation times, we observed evidence that the technology was not initially considered to be viable in the chosen market opportunity, and that, during the gestation time, the SSE mentored scientist-entrepreneurs and was involved in attracting VCs (Tables 2 and 3) , as well as further developing the technology towards commercial viability. Such strategy has systematically led to multiple rounds of financing from venture capitalists and the public market (Table 3) . These levels of financing are far higher than typical VC financing for university spin-offs (Zhang, 2009, Table 6) Much basic research and certainly generic platform technologies allow for a broad range of applications over time (Maine and Garnsey, 2006) . As projects that draw on this platform technology are formulated, iterative technology-market matching done at the project formulation stage allows the star scientist and lab members additional time to design experiments to establish commercial viability prior to firm formation. As depicted in Figure 4 , 10 ventures were spun out of the platform technology of controlled release polymers over nearly 40 years: noteably, for 9 of these 10 spin-offs, technology-market matching occurred in the project formulation stage ( Table   2 ).",

Although each commercialization decision may be recognized as important individually, our study reveals the importance of the coordination and sequencing of these key decisions in leading to well-endowed university spin-offs pre-formation. Repeatedly, we observed technology-market matching during the project formulation stage, the broad, blocking, relevant patents linked to elite publication and the delayed firm formation. Such coordination, sequencing, and timing of decisions by the SSE (with his collaborators and the TLO), mostly in stealth mode, helps prepare the nascent venture in the pre-formation and early post-formation stages of venture emergence. The holistic nature of this extended case method study, and the nuanced empirical evidence anchored in time by the patent-paper-venture matching method represent a significant contribution to the strategic timing literature, as well as to the broader literatures on academic entrepreneurship and dynamic capabilities. Investors might also benefit from the insights provided by our study. Our measure of broad, blocking, relevant patents might be a useful metric for them to utilize in identifying high potential ventures ex-ante. Investors -particularly those with domain-specific expertise -may also choose to invest in long term relationships with scientist-entrepreneurs, helping them develop technology-market matching capabilities and introducing them to their networks of potential venture CEOs.",

First, by concentrating on the career of an unusually prolific biomedical star-scientist-entrepreneur at MIT, the generalizability of the results may be questioned. Clearly, entrepreneurial outcomes at elite universities located in leading technology clusters are not representative of the average university or region (Nightingale and Coad, 2014; Siegel and Wright, 2015) . Nevertheless, we contend that such universities are where the phenomenon of science-based university spin-off emergence is most prevalent. Stuart and Ding (2006) find that elite universities form the most science-based spin-offs, with scientists at the top 20 US universities being 3 times more likely to become a scientist-entrepreneur, and that scientists involved in the founding of a university spin-off published at a rate of 1.7 times that of their matched \"pure\" scientist. There is also evidence of an increasing prevalence of serial scientist-entrepreneurs (Lawson and Sterzi, 2014; Stuart and Ding, 2006) . The nuanced evidence provided in this study about the role of this exemplar scientist-entrepreneur in university spin-off formation can inform and enhance commercialization activities by academic-entrepreneurs at a broad range of institutions. For example, technology-market matching at the project formulation stage is a learned capability which can be developed by academic scientists in any region.",

Responding to calls for processoriented, individual-level studies to extend dynamic capabilities theory (Protogerou et al., 2012, pp. 641; Schilke et al., 2018) , this study contributes to the academic entrepreneurship literature by extending dynamic capabilities theory to the individual-level during the pre-formation stage of science-based university spin-offs. Methods were developed to identify biomedical platform technologies and match the inventions (embodied in 363 granted US patents and 1476 papers) of a biomedical star-scientist-entrepreneur with the 30 university spin-offs he co-founded over 40 years of his career, allowing for a longitudinal examination of the progression of science from research laboratory to science-based university spin-off. A process model was developed, depicting the key role played by the SSE in four pre-formation entrepreneurial capabilities which endow these science-based university spin-offs for success: technology-market matching, claiming and protecting the invention, attracting and mentoring the founding team, and strategic 48 timing. This paper demonstrates how these entrepreneurial capabilities can be developed and deployed by scientist-entrepreneurs. We propose that such entrepreneurial capabilities can also be taught more broadly to university scientists. Our study suggests that innovation policies aimed at innovative start-ups should focus on supporting scientist-entrepreneurs in the pre-formation stage of university spin-off emergence. The recommendations drawn from this research can guide academic scientists, investors, university leadership, and policy makers in fostering the commercialization of scientific inventions through university spin-offs. Fig. 2 ) Can be disaggregated into the capacity (1) to sense and shape opportunities (2) to seize opportunities (3) to maintain competitiveness through enhancing, combining, protecting, and when necessary, reconfiguring the enterprises.

The broad, blocking, relevant patent was filed even before the paper was submitted. Many scientists entrepreneurs would have launched a venture at that time. However, the technology was not considered by Langer to be viable yet, because it was too far from meeting the clinical needs of patients in the identified market opportunity -the therapeutic nanoparticles circulated in the bloodstream for less than an hour and needed to circulate for several hours and to release their payload accurately -and developing those aspects of the technology would take longer than a venture capital fund's investment window(Maine and Thomas, 2017). During the gestation period within MIT, advances were made in the limiting factors preventing viability. Aspiring scientist-entrepreneur Omir Farokhzhad joined the Langer Lab and extended the research, making a breakthrough in developing targeting to specific tumour sites, and further advancing the technology within his own lab when he started a faculty position at Harvard. Together, Farokhzhad and Langer founded both Bind Therapeutics and Selecta Therapeutics, from the same underlying technology, when they assessed the remaining development time and perceived value to be a good fit with venture capital investors.",

The extension of Murray and Stern's (2007) methodology from patent-paper matching to patent-paper-venture matching allowed a complete longitudinal observation of the commercialization of public science, and revealed patterns underlying the observed entrepreneurial capabilities. This methodology also enabled the multi-level analysis advocated byFini et al.

In the case of INVIVO, eventual CEO Frank Reynolds, also studying for his MBA at MIT, was attracted to the SSE's research on spinal cord injury because of his personal experience with this type of injury. The SSE supported him in the development of the commercialization strategy for his treatment for spinal cord injury, which was the topic of Reynolds' MBA thesis. Reynolds subsequently co-founded INVIVO, serving as CEO from founding in 2005 until 2013.Another part of the star-scientist-entrepreneur's capabilities in attracting and mentoring the founding team lies in his ability to repeatedly attract VCs. Since co-founding AIR with VC Terrance McGuire, the SSE has developed deep relationships with venture capitalists (two of whom are alumni from his lab). A VC was a co-founder in 6 of the 21 ventures co-founded by the SSE from his lab. In 2 other cases, evidence was found that a VC was attracted to invest because of the reputation or network of the SSE. No evidence was found of the SSE directly attracting experienced CEOs: however there was some evidence of an indirect role through the networks of the VCs he attracted.Venture capitalists often suggest managerial talent including initial CEOs, drawing on their extensive networks. The reputation and credibility of the SSE's view of the potential impact of the technology is key to convincing such business talent to take the risk of joining the founding team. Stephane Bancel, CEO of Moderna, part of the network of the founding VC, was attracted to the venture by the potential of the technology and the reputation of the SSE, explaining \"I was willing to take a career risk by working on something that might not work, but it would have to be something that, if it worked, would change the world\"",

First, scientistentrepreneurs will increase their likelihood of value creation by developing proficiency in technology-market matching to formulate projects which address critical unmet needs and to capture broader value. Second, focusing on platform technologies, publishing in elite journals, and filing early, broad, blocking patents can increase a science-based spin-off's likelihood of securing financing, with the caveat that such patents are expensive to file and maintain. Third, by mentoring lab members to develop solutions for significant unmet market needs, attracting venture capitalists, and by identifying and nurturing business talent, academic entrepreneurs can endow science-based university spin-offs for success. Fourth, incubating a nascent spin-off until the breakthrough technology has demonstrated commercial viability and the scientific leadership is mentored gives the university spin-off a greater chance of meeting venture capital investor expectations. Taken together, these practices can help in translating scientific inventions from lab to market.",
