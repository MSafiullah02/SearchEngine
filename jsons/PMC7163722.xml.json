            "text": "Cross\u2010border health crises have attracted a lot of attention among the general public in the last few years, most recently with the Ebola virus. The European Union (EU) has a long history of health crises (such as the Bovine spongiform encephalopathy or \u201cmad cow\u201d disease). Most pertinently perhaps, the creation of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is often portrayed as the functional response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis that occurred between November 2002 and July 2003 (Greer 2012; Greer and L\u00f6blov\u00e1 2016; McKee, Atun, and Coker 2008). This perspective on the importance of the crisis in the creation of the agency is often used to explain why such a short period was spent between the European Commission drafting a proposal to create the ECDC in July 2003 and the creation in situ of the agency in May 2005. The ECDC hence looks like a mundane case of agency creation: a crisis triggered a response; this response was a new agency. This idea that the time \u201chas come\u201d for an agency to be created is a recurring theme in the official narratives of agency creation as well as in the literature on the emergence of agencies that regulate or distribute information used by regulators (Alam 2007; Maggetti 2013). The ECDC, in particular, is charged with bringing expertise to the table, thus reducing uncertainty and allowing an evidence\u2010based regulation of risk.",

But in the field of disease prevention and control in Europe, we can observe that some features of the ECDC were pre\u2010existent to SARS; notably a network of epidemiological surveillance, now an integral part of the ECDC, existed since the early 1990s. Moreover, the creation of a European agency dedicated to disease control has been disputed among experts and has been a topic of disagreement between European institutions since the late 1990s. At a minimum, the creation of an agency as response to the crisis has to be put in its context of conflict and contestation of the various institutional choices aired at the time. In this paper, I challenge the conventional wisdom of agency creation as response to the crisis and open the black box of the organizational and political processes of creation dynamics. As shown by Moe (2005), institutional emergence is a political process where power is created, distributed, and re\u2010arranged in the form of a precise set of organizational features.",

However, in the case of the ECDC, there is no figure that emerges as a policy entrepreneur. Some ideas were championed by different actors; however, rather than one idea emerging, bits and pieces of different ideas seem to have been recombined in a proposal of the European Commission. How can organizational change be explained without a policy entrepreneur? Can the MSA be refined to present coupling the streams as something other than the result of policy\u2010entrepreneurs? How can we explain that ideas, sometimes presented as contradictory, may be identified in the institutional features of the ECDC?",

            "text": "Agency in the MSA is usually incarnated in the figure of the policy entrepreneur. Walker (1974, 113) defines policy entrepreneurship as the advancement of solutions that are tied closely with the maintenance of entrepreneurial needs and interests. Zahariadis (2008, 18) presents the policy entrepreneur as the proactive element of the MSA capable of developing strategies to promote her solutions. In the MSA, policy entrepreneurs are successful when their efforts for entrepreneurship lead to coupling the streams in accordance to their preferences. Policy entrepreneurship is thus defined as efforts made by the policy entrepreneur to promote solutions consistent with her needs and interest. From these definitions, I infer that the actions of the policy entrepreneur are a solution\u2010driven process from softening\u2010up to coupling the streams. Nevertheless, Zahariadis (2003, 73) identifies two types of coupling: \u201cwhen windows open in the politics stream, coupling is likely to be doctrinal (finding a problem to a given solution),\u201d and \u201cwhen policy windows open the problem stream, coupling is likely to be consequential (finding a solution to a given problem).\u201d While doctrinal coupling suits the traditional assumptions on the activities of the policy entrepreneur (a solution\u2010driven process or an outcome process), consequential coupling underlines that coupling can be seen as a problem\u2010driven process. Therefore, let us turn to the literature on the problem stream that is eloquent on the notion of focusing events and how they lead to policy windows. This notion, first introduced by Kingdon ([1984] 2003), was then adapted by Birkland (1998a; 1998b) to study the effect of accidents and natural disasters as drivers of change. In the literature, new research venues appeared recently, inspired by the financial and budgetary crisis, such as Saurugger and Terpan (2015), refining the MSA to demonstrate that the stronger the crisis, the more important the change. While the literature informs us on drivers and scope of change, there is room for studying a type of agency in the MSA that is defined as a problem\u2010driven process rather than a solution\u2010driven one.",

            "text": "The bricoleur as a type of agent distinct from the policy entrepreneur does not have clear or fixed preferences for one solution over another. Her choice is thus dictated by a consequential search for fit (Zahariadis 2003, 73). Put bluntly, the bricoleur looks for policy ideas that would be useful in crafting a new solution: policy ideas as a resource to create solutions. Here enters the second theme: how does the bricoleur select these policy ideas? Why are bricoleurs drawn to some ideas rather than others? The emergence of ideas in the MSA is likened to a process of natural selection (Kingdon [1984] 2003) in which the \u201csurvival\u201d of ideas is arbitrated by two criteria: value acceptability (compatibility with the values of the policy network) and technical feasibility (to what extent can the idea be translated into the real world?). These criteria are relevant to understand what ideas are at the disposal of the bricoleur and why they survived the natural selection process, but do not offer explanatory leverage on why the bricoleur selects some ideas rather than other ones. On what does the bricoleur base her judgement? I suggest two criteria that the bricoleur uses when she arbitrates different policy ideas.\nThe first one is an important element of the MSA: the ripeness of the politics stream (Herweg, Hu\u00df, and Zohlnh\u00f6fer 2015). The bricoleur selects policy ideas to which policymakers are ripe to; otherwise, the policy solution would not pass the decision\u2010making stage.The second one is more innovative and suggests that the bricoleur builds on the initiatives developed by the policy community. This is the criterion of increasing returns: the bricoleur avoids the costs of exiting initiatives and even capitalizes on projects already developed by the policy community. Therefore, the bricoleur is likely to use ideas in which the policy community has invested time and efforts.\n",

The first stream is the policy stream. Different ideas navigate in the policy stream: how do they stand the criterion of increasing returns? Evidence comes from the debate that animated the policy community by analyzing articles in different publications of practitioners. This paper then investigates the variations in the politics stream and analyze how the respective positions of the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament (EP) have shown appetite for different solutions, how the European Commission has evolved from opponent to promotor of the creation of the ECDC and how this has affected the recombination of ideas. In order to do so, official positions of the institutions have been identified from the Official Journal of the European Union and the archives of the different institutions. The problem stream is eventually analyzed in terms of perception, also drawing from archives and speeches. The second methodological step is to demonstrate the lack of fit of the figure of the policy entrepreneur in a part that reflects on the window of opportunity and agency and on how the European Commission's framing of the SARS crisis led to coupling by bricolage. Eventually, building on the analysis of the three streams, this paper focuses on the policy formulation part of bricolage, as well as the decision\u2010making process and delivers a review of the concept in conclusion.",

While Levi\u2010Strauss looked at the concept from an anthropological point of view, the concept of bricolage resonated in different disciplines of social science. In public policy, the concept captures epistemological strategies and rationalities, under the name of Epistemological Bricolage\n(Freeman 2007). The concept is identified as a self\u2010learning process, the act of piecing together knowledge, as one \u201cacquires and assembles tools and material as he or she goes.\u201d (Freeman 2007, 486; see also Carstensen 2011).

The bricoleur realizes there is a problem after an event occurs. The bricoleur's agency lays in the choice to ignore the problem or to solve it. Once the choice made to solve the problem, the bricoleur looks for the means to come up with a solution.A process goal: the bricoleur uses devious means (Levi\u2010Strauss 1988, 11) to create a bespoke solution to a specific problem.

In the case of the EP, this happens in a context of growing hostility towards agencification where new agencies are seen as an \u201cirresponsible\u201d development of the European Executive that endangers the balance of power between elected bodies and technocratic institutions (Lord 2011, 912, quoting the Herman Report, European Parliament 1999). Nevertheless, the EP has demonstrated no suspicion toward the creation of an agency dedicated to the surveillance, control, and prevention of communicable diseases and even championed the creation of an institution from the beginning (Bowis 2004). What explains the role of the EP in championing the Agency approach rather than the Network approach? The agency idea presents technical characteristics that leave room for a greater oversight of the EP. While agencification is usually seen as a phenomenon that accentuates deparliamentarization (Lord 2011, 913), the case of the ECDC differs from policy sectors of exclusive competences. The EP's preferences were formulated in a policy vacuum and it is then not surprising that an institution traditionally eager to secure oversight makes the choice of the most institutionalized option. Lord comes to this conclusion about the EP when the other option is a \u201cvoluntary pattern of co\u2010operation\u201d (2011, 915). Kelemen (2014) underlines that, where the EP has influence over agency design, it tends to weight on the creation of bureaucratic structures to enhance the transparency and accountability of agencies. The EP thus favors the Agency idea because it gives the Agency a stronger value acceptability than a network approach, based on oversight considerations. The amendments of the EP have been consistently suggesting creating a center rather than a network: \u201cHaving regard to the current shortcomings in the structures for the epidemiological surveillance of communicable diseases in the Member States and, therefore, the need to establish a permanent structure at Community level\u201d; and suggests \u201ccollecting information relating to epidemiological surveillance and coordinating control measures in order then to forward them to a central body: the European Centre for the Surveillance of Communicable Diseases.\u201d (Cabrol 1997).",

If not relying on grand theories of integration, the assumptions have been that health policy was progressively Europeanized (B\u00f6hm and Landwehr 2013). However, the case of disease prevention is particular in the sense that the Maastricht Treaty (art. 129) gave, for the first time, legal competences to the European Commission to complement national policies, within the limits of disease prevention, health information, and education. The Maastricht Treaty paved the way for this opportunity for the fathers of the Charter group by asking the Commission to finance their initiative. This demonstrates that this policy idea emerged thanks to the realization of a problem that was recognized in the treaties, in line with the neo\u2010functionalist or the Europeanization assumptions presented earlier.

The decision\u2010making process of setting up a network for the epidemiological surveillance in 1998 could hardly be considered a coupling of the streams: the change is minimal and the result is a formalization of the EU's sponsorship of the initiative.

The solution the European Commission was looking for was not a tool to solve the threat of the SARS outbreak; rather it was the result of considerations that the EU could be at risk.

This new take on agency in the MSA is a response to criticisms that underline that ambiguity of preferences clashes with the existence of a policy entrepreneur with a clear personal agenda (Zohlnh\u00f6fer and R\u00fcb 2016). In bricolage, the agent does not have clear preferences on how to solve the problem. The micro\u2010foundations of the bricolage are that preferences regarding solutions are secondary; the issue of problem solving is at the core of this type of agency. The lack of preferences beyond looking forward to solving a problem explains why solutions are the result of an oblique mechanism. Bricolage produces a new arrangement of elements that are preconstrained because resources are scarce and cannot be expanded. In our case study, bricolage is performed by the European Commission who pieced together a policy solution that was based on previously consolidated organizational choices. Here the process tracing showed that the Commission's choice relates to the increasing returns of the network of epidemiological surveillance and the evolving ripeness of policymakers to the idea of an agency. Our bricoleur avoided the costs of exit from the network and combined elements of the agency idea to the solution because the member states were ripe to it.",

The purposeful opportunist is different from the bricoleur, while both are empirically identified as the Commission, and both can be seen as process goal driven rather than solution goal driven. Important differences remain. Cram's purposeful opportunist is an agent that accumulates knowledge until the moment it can seize an opportunity. The bricoleur is less strategic in cumulating reservoirs of knowledge that can be mobilized when the right moment comes. Bricolage can also be put in relation to models of decision. Prima facie it may resemble muddling through (Lindblom 1959), especially considering the importance of the concept ripeness of the politics stream. Bricolage and muddling through are, nevertheless, different. Muddling through is a collective process of partisan mutual adjustment. Bricolage takes partisan adjustments as one of the elements of the equation along with increasing returns of ideas. Moreover, these adjustments are not mutual, rather the bricoleur should be seen as one who has a precise idea of the policymakers' preferences and who is able to come up with a solution in the function of these preferences.",
