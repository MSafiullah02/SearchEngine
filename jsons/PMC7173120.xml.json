The asthma and atopy in children are closely interrelated with increased TH2-type cells, and decreased type I/II/III interferon (IFN) responses and susceptibility to RV infections.3 Less is known about HBoV1, but HBoV1 bronchiolitis has been associated with balanced TH1/TH2-type response in nasopharyngeal mucosa.4 Whether these cytokine responses reflect the immunity of the host or the species of the virus is unclear. Interestingly, cloned HBoV1 has inhibited Sendai virus\u2013induced IFN production in vitro, suggesting that it may also affect the host responses against other viruses in vivo.5 However, in vivo data of virus interference by respiratory virus in humans are lacking.",

All acute HBoV1 infections were serologically confirmed.6 Serum taken at study entry was analyzed for the following cytokines by using the Human Cytokine LINCO plex Kit (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, Mass; sensitivities for each cytokine are shown in Table E1 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org): GM-CSF, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 (p70), IL-13, and TNF-\u03b1.7 Children were followed up for 7 years, and the time to recurrent wheezing was assessed as previously defined.2\n",

Interestingly, coinfection with RV and HBoV1 resulted in a modified, non\u2013TH 2-type cytokine response. This finding together with previous in vitro data5 suggests that HBoV1 may interfere with RV-induced immune responses. The immunological responses were accompanied by the clinical finding that children with HBoV1 or combined RV-HBoV1 wheeze tended to develop recurrent wheezing later and less often than did those with RV wheeze. Because the severity of RV infections is known to be related to atopic status,8 understanding the mechanism of HBoV1 infection may open new targets to tackle RV-associated undesired events such as recurrent wheeze and asthma development.2, 9\n",

These changes were similar to those reported in RV infection,3 although we were not able to show a significant link between RV and atopy. These findings fit in a hypothesis that early TH2-skewed inflammation exists in RV wheeze before sensitization can be detected.2 Altogether, our findings suggest that immunological responses in acute wheezing are dependent on both host (atopy-related inflammation) and virus-specific factors and that virus-virus interaction may be of significance in modulating these responses.",
