It is thus possible to detect remnants of tumors, infections, necrosis, osteoporosis, and malformations, as also traumatisms, dental alterations, rickets, rheumatism, and other diseases of the bones. Today, laboratory analysis allows the possibility of detecting remnants of other diseases, germs, or lesions, in animal or human remains, including of course the famous mummies. From the first settlements in the Fertile Crescent, changes have taken place in the relationship of man and animals with their environment and it is possible to establish an extensive catalog of diseases that have largely subsisted down to this very day. Particularly significant are the forms of settlement, the crops and hunting, and the contact of man with cattle, pets, and parasites, as well as the relations between peoples, through mixing and trade, wars, and migrations.",

Caused by different plasmodia (Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum among others, with different geographical distribution), its relation with human populations is shaped by migrations and deforestation, hunting and farming, climate and soils, crops, animals and foods, and a complicated immunity resulting from ancient genetic mutations and new infections. Thus, with the early human emigrations, it expanded through Eurasia, and in the third millennia BC, malaria had already set in the early civilizations in marshy areas where the water, the climate, and the crops provided the conditions for the Anopheles mosquitoes to infect in crowded populations. Evidence for the existence of intermittent fevers is already to be found in ancient cultures, finding suitable conditions along the Yellow, Indus, Ganges, Euphrates, or Nile Rivers.",

The connection between fevers, splenomegaly, and marshy areas appears in the Hippocratic texts, such as On Airs, Waters and Places. Deforestation, agriculture, temperature, and a greater population density, as well as military and commercial movements, favor the spread of the disease. In Italy, in Republican times, the disease becomes acute; and it was recommended that the marshy lands be either abandoned or sold and that people should dwell on high ground \u2013 the latter being traditional advice and here defense reasons also counted. Also, the cleaning and draining of swamps was considered, this being the origin of systems of engineering sanitation. The spread of malaria got worse and worse in Rome owing to negligence and flooding, climate and agricultural changes, wars, travels, and migrations, and it reached its zenith at the time of the fall of the Roman Empire, a cataclysm to which it may have contributed. But when the old Empire declined, another frightening ghost traveled through the Mediterranean Sea.",

Destructive epidemic catastrophes were narrated frequently in Mesopotamian, Biblical, Egyptian, Indian, or Chinese sources, and in 430\u2013426 BC, Thucydides describes the plague of Athens in the war against Sparta, but it is doubtful that this case refers to the bubonic plague. This epidemic death is considered the beginning of the decline of Athenian hegemony, the crisis of the democracy, and culture of the Pericles era. Fear, war, siege of the city, and its maritime port were accompanied by the death of the great ruler Pericles. Later on, the first reliable description of this disease is that given by Rufus of Ephesus in the AD first to the second century, in the epoch of Trajan; and in the sixth century, the Plague of Justinian initiates the first great epidemic cycles of bubonic plague. Soldiers and merchants, animals and merchandises, and slaves and prisoners all contribute to linking up the extremes of the known world. A consequence of this contact was the Antonine Plague in the second century. This plague \u2013and others \u2013 is attributed to smallpox, a disease that had already existed as far back as 3000 years ago, as certain mummies show.",

Natural catastrophes, wars, poverty, and famines were escorted by mental diseases, tuberculosis and pneumonia, traumatisms and poisonings, diarrheal diseases and fevers, as well as smallpox and measles. In the Mediterranean basin, malaria continued to be endemic with the population tending to resort to residing on the hills and mountains, far from marshy lands. The extension of malaria involved south and southeast of Asia, Central China and Japan, and also North Europe. The plague set in the growing cities with the burden of rats and fleas, making this disease an explicative example par excellence of epidemic history. A second epidemic cycle began with the Black Death in 1348. Commerce and the cities collapsed, giving rise to the origin of the modern European kingdoms. At this time, Venice established control over persons and ships, in order to avoid the spread of plague, arriving from distant lands. Dark Ages are ending, and New Worlds are opening in culture and geography.",

The discovery of America, with its scattered population devoted to agriculture, where there were no dirty cities, and where the inhabitants were devoid of immunity to the diseases of old Europe, produced an enormous demographic crisis. Certain diseases, such as smallpox (and measles) ravaged the indigenous population; this very contagious and harsh illness was introduced in the Caribbean and Mexico, and destroyed American indigenous populations. Syphilis came supposedly from America (although other human treponematoses were present in other continents), brought back by the Spaniards and it caused havoc since Renaissance in Europe and soon all around the world. Troop movements spread an unknown disease called \u2018tabardillo,\u2019 or \u2018typhus exanthematicus,\u2019 bringing about serious suffering for armies and poor people.

In the seventeenth century, it took root in Brazil and also spread to the Caribbean and throughout America, reaching New York and Boston and likewise Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. It affected warm America and Europe, through the Iberian Peninsula. Immunity and cutoffs in commerce stalled the disease, but it remains endemic in tropical areas of America and Africa. Also, malaria arrived to America with the European conquest in sixteenth century, beginning in the Caribbean and Central America and soon spreading to South and North America, becoming endemic in hot, wet, and low lands. Malaria was combated since the seventeenth century by the use of cinchona bark (Peruvian bark), found in Peru, as an indigenous medical practice. Later on, the quinine \u2013 the alkaloid obtained from the bark in French laboratories \u2013 gave rise to rich industry and trade. Trees were cultivated in British and Dutch colonies, mainly in Java. After being taken in the Second World War by the Japanese army, synthetic products such as atebrine and chloroquine were obtained. Getting worse with agriculture, mining and livestock changes, settlements, and slavery trade, malaria became \u2013 together with yellow fever \u2013 a scourge along the warm and hot reaches. Throughout the American conflicts between European empires, and later during the American Independence Wars, both diseases played an important role, infecting and killing nonimmune soldiers.",

The great writer Daniel Defoe remembered the terrible contagion in London in 1665 in Journal of the Plague Year. After the great European plague of Marseille in 1720, the relative peace of the eighteenth century allowed Western Europe to set up sea and land defenses, with Austria becoming a solid bulwark in the face of the Ottoman Empire, thus sealing off all possible spread of the plague. Toward the middle of the nineteenth century, the third wave of the disease broke out and, with the exception of Europe, it spread to all countries including Asia, Africa, and paradises like America and Australia, leaving remnants in many places. The eradication of plague in Europe was a result of the advent of public hygiene, immunity to disease, and the disappearance of rats and of the old and dirty wooden buildings. The great London Fire in 1666 \u2018purified\u2019 the city, since the hygienic rebuilding was carried out in stone, eliminating animals and dirt.",

This disease was described by Western travelers in the sixteenth century and its spread to Europe and America was a consequence of pilgrimages, trade, and a lack of cleanliness in water. A great pandemic broke out in 1817 from India and spread through Eastern Africa and Southern Asia, arriving to China and the Philippines, and in a second wave, it spread through Persia reaching Russia and Poland in 1830. Then this second wave swept across Europe and reached America by 1832. Throughout 100 years, terrible waves spread from the East. However, the timely and necessary cleansing of urban water supplies helped to progressively stall its advance. Nevertheless, as late as 1892, the free Hanseatic City of Hamburg suffered an outbreak of cholera epidemic, while the neighboring Altona, governed by the Prussian Reich, was able to avoid the disease, thanks to the successful filtering of its water. Local and national governments advanced in hygiene and they attempted to bring about healthier cities by means of appropriate public health measures. The nineteenth century sees the beginning of the demographic revolution in Europe, followed by developing countries, in America for example, with a sharp decline in mortality, especially maternal\u2013infant mortality. Old inoculation and the new vaccination proposed in 1798 by Edward Jenner fought smallpox successfully. Studies about human immunity since the last decades of nineteenth century began a new medical approach to the prevention and understanding of illness, being successful in the contention of many diseases, which have a long record of burdens and deaths. Mother care also advanced both throughout pregnancy and at childbirth and during lactation.",

Some of the diseases were strictly occupational as in the case of miners and textile workers who were exposed to injury, and to industrial poisons that affected the proletariat. Sir Percivall Pott described in the eighteenth century the cancer produced in professional cleaners (chimney sweep) by chemical toxics contained in soot. Many other diseases, such as cancers, will be attributed to chemical and physical aggressions, including radioactivity. Other diseases were closely related to the harsh and dirty conditions of life such as spread of typhoid fever and pulmonary diseases. Tuberculosis spread over the turn between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and while it was represented as the disease in fashion, affecting notable and distinguished people, it struck the proletariat much more severely. The same can be claimed regarding the enormous spread of syphilis, and drug abuse, beginning with alcohol and continuing with cocaine and morphine.",

The twentieth century marked the descent of the high mortality rates in countries that reached high standards of sanitary development, investing in health care and public health. Such advances have been due to public health services, hospitals, antibiotics, surgery, and vaccination, and they have been reinforced by the developments in immunology and microsurgery, pharmacology, and biotechnology and with the promising future of genetic engineering. The international health solidarity promoted by the World Health Organization (WHO), and other governmental and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), including church missionaries, were accompanied by better governance of nations, and internationalization of information and resources.

During nineteenth century, malaria expanded all around the world, arriving to the central extensions of America and Eurasia.

Many governmental campaigns also fought against malaria; several national programs were effective, from Taiwan and China to the United States, Brazil, and Argentina, passing across the Mediterranean basin, from Italy to Egypt. Opinions and campaigns oscillated between quinine treatment, fighting against mosquitoes (by dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT)), and improvements in life, education, and land sanitation, clearing up the marshy areas. Malaria has been eradicated from Europe thanks to drainage, improvements in crop cultivation, mechanical barriers, quinine and modern drugs such as atebrine and chloroquine, and insecticides. Colonial settlements entered tropical areas backed by quinine, nets in beds, hygiene, and sanitation, but transmissible diseases were continuously a serious burden for colonial armies, in America, Africa, or Asia. Some chemical products such as DDT were a successful support for soldiers, travelers, merchants, or settlers. Nevertheless, in 1955, the World Health Assembly, meeting in Mexico, warned against the resistance of the mosquitoes to insecticides. Mosquitoes are still today carrying both diseases, and also dengue. Chagas disease produced by Trypanosoma cruzi is endemic in America, and sleeping sickness caused by Trypanosoma brucei (rhodesiense and gambiense) occurs in Africa.",

Cholera continues to be feared in Asia, between India and the Far East, and also in warm zones in America and Africa. Wars and catastrophes, travels and migrations, as well as famines and unhealthy conditions allowed the expansion of the cholera germ, the Vibrio cholerae isolated by Robert Koch in 1883, as was the case of the recent tragedy of Haiti. At the end of nineteenth century, the third outbreak of bubonic plague allowed its bacteriological and epidemiological description. The germ of bubonic plague Yersinia pestis, discovered by Yersin and Kitasato, is still to be found throughout the world. The germ is carried by rats, Rattus rattus: rat fleas are the arthropod vectors transmitting \u2018epizootic\u2019 plague to humans from rodent hosts, and related species, but transmission among humans is also possible.

The Rio Political Declaration in the World Conference on Social Determinants of Health (WHO-Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 21 October 2011) is a new call looking for equity, justice, and universality of health. It has recommended adopting better governance for health and development; promoting information, justice, and participation in policy making and during the implementation process; including civil society like indigenous people; and reducing health inequities in the health sector. This Declaration promotes research on the relationships between social determinants and differences (economic, ethnic, and gender inequalities) and health equity. We are all convinced about the relation between poverty, social discrimination, low education and low sanitation, and diseases and death.",
