A compound symmetry correlation structure was used to account for correlations between repeated visits within the same subject. Residual plots were examined to verify model assumptions. All reported P values are 2 sided, and P < .05 was used to define statistical significance. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute).",

The density of all 3 of the common respiratory bacterial pathogens in nasal samples, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis, increased by nearly a factor of 10 between surveillance periods and episodes of symptomatic URTI. In addition, it has been shown for the first time that bacterial detection and density of all 3 sinus pathogens increase during asymptomatic viral infection. In general, bacterial density was lowest for asymptomatic visits at which virus was not detected and highest for acute URTI visits at which virus was detected. Bacterial densities decreased to near-baseline levels during recovery. The impact of virus detection on bacterial detection and density lasted about 14 days from the onset of symptoms.",

This large effect of virus detection on S. pneumoniae was also observed during asymptomatic viral infections. Interestingly, the proportion colonized for all 3 pathogens was similar between surveillance visits with virus detected and acute URTI visits with no virus detected. Furthermore, there were no differences in the frequency of bacterial colonization between episodes of acute URTI with virus and those without virus. Accordingly, it is possible that the upper respiratory tract symptoms in acute episodes of URTI without virus are in fact caused by a virus not in our PCR panel or present in undetectable amounts.",

A similar observation was made by Kloepfer et al [17] for S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis but not H. influenzae in a group of children with or without asthma who were followed up for 5 weeks in the autumn season. These differences (in bacterial species) may be explained by season or age, but the suggestion that bacterial species may cause respiratory symptoms is the same and may have therapeutic implications.",

Proliferation of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis is thought to be a necessary step in the development of these conditions. Faden et al demonstrated an increase in the carriage rate of otopathogens in the nasopharynx of children with acute otitis media during URTI, compared with well children [21, 22]. Other more recent studies, using culture and quantitative PCR, have shown an increase in pneumococcal carriage [23] and density during acute URTI [24\u201326]. Xu et al [27] also recently reported that nasopharyngeal colonization rates of otopathogens during health were significantly lower than during URTI. Studies of otitis media and sinusitis have demonstrated that the presence of pathogenic bacteria in the nasopharynx markedly increases the risk of these complications [2\u20134, 28\u201331]. During URTI, there are complex interactions between bacteria and viruses [32, 33]. These observations suggest that the combination of virus and bacteria is necessary but not sufficient for the development of bacterial complications of URTI.",

These data allow us to understand the development of cases of acute otitis media, acute bacterial sinusitis, and their complications (mastoiditis and subperiosteal orbital cellulitis) in children without respiratory symptoms or whose respiratory symptoms are extremely modest [35]. In nearly 50% of children presenting with complications of sinusitis, the complication is the first signal of the underlying sinus infection. The current findings demonstrate that, even in the absence of symptoms, viral infection enhances bacterial colonization and density. We can speculate that this enhancement of colonization, especially with S. pneumoniae, predisposes the patient to the complications of URTI.",

Samples were obtained with a nasal blow technique rather than by nasopharyngeal swab sample for patient comfort and to improve adherence. This method may seem to be prone to inconsistency, given the potential for variations in dilution.
