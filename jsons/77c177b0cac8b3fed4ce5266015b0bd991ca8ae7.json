Using recently published UK data, we have developed a risk model that provides estimates of personal vulnerability to Covid-19 according to sex, age, ethnicity, and various comorbidities. Vulnerability from each risk factor is quantified in terms of its equivalence to added years of age. Addition of the impact from each risk factor to an individual's true age generates their \"Covid-age\", a summary measure representing the age of a healthy UK white male with equivalent vulnerability. We discuss important limitations of the model, including current scientific uncertainties and limitations on generalisability beyond the UK setting and its use beyond informing assessments of individual vulnerability in the workplace.

The risk of contracting Covid-19 64 through work will depend on the potential for close proximity to people who could be carrying Covid-19 4 . Neither document attempted to quantify risks from specific comorbidities, but 77 research is now emerging that allows more detailed and reliable assessment of vulnerability 78 to Covid-19. In these circumstances, we judged it timely to analyse evidence on risk factors 79 for mortality from the disease, and apply the findings in a risk model that could be used to 80 estimate personal vulnerability.

For example, chronic pulmonary disease aggregates various 251 disorders, each with a range of severity. In the future, data should emerge that allow 252 evidence-based risk assessments for more specific sub-categories of disease. Meanwhile, 253 clinical judgement should be applied when considering how risks might vary within a 254 broader, aggregated category of comorbidity, taking as a starting point the estimated risk for 255 the category as a whole. 256 257 Fatality as an outcome 258 Our assessment of vulnerability uses fatality as an outcome, and does not take into account 259 loss of life-years. An avoidable death in a young person will normally result in much greater 260 loss of life-years than one occurring at older ages. 261 262 Generalisability 263",

Published ONS data on mortality from Covid-19 (as the underlying cause of death) 133 by sex and age in England and Wales during March 2020 7 . The death rates make no 134 allowance for effects of comorbidities, the prevalence of which may vary by age, and 135 between men and women. However, they provided a benchmark against which more 136 fully adjusted estimates of relative risk by sex and age could be compared. 137 138 2. Published ONS estimates of sex-specific odds ratios for coronavirus-related deaths 139 by ethnic group in England and Wales 8 . These were adjusted for age, geographical 140 region and various other potential confounders, although not for comorbidities. 141 142 3. A report from the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection 143 Consortium (ISARIC) study on outcomes, including mortality, in a cohort of 16,749 144 patients with Covid-19 admitted to hospitals in England, Wales and Scotland during 6 145 February 2020 to 18 April 2020 (28% of all such admissions nationally during that 146 period) 9 . Within the cohort, 49% had been discharged, 33% had died, and 17% 147 continued to receive care at the date of reporting. The study reported the prevalence 148 of various pre-existing comorbidities in the cohort, and used multivariate Cox 149 regression to estimate risk of in-hospital death according to age, sex and selected 150 comorbidities. 151 152 4. The prevalence of comorbidities by sex and age in samples of people (intended to be 153 nationally representative) from recent rounds of the Health Survey for England 10-13 . 154 155 Although the Health Survey for England data predated the ISARIC study, were only from 156England, and did not apply the same diagnostic criteria and methods of ascertainment as 157 ISARIC, we could use them to calculate an approximate predicted prevalence of 158 comorbidities in the ISARIC cohort. Comparison of the observed and expected prevalence 159 then gave an indication, albeit approximate, of the age-and sex-adjusted relative risks of 160 being hospitalised with Covid-19 according to comorbidities. When combined with HRs for 161 death following admission to hospital in the ISARIC study, this allowed approximate 162 estimation of relative risks of mortality from Covid-19 among people with the comorbidity in 163",
