            "text": "In December 2019 the emergence of a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan, China [1]. Since its emergence, the disease COVID-19 caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly with at the end of April worldwide more than 3 million cases and deaths reaching 200.000 (2). Clinical symptoms range from mild upper respiratory tract symptoms to severe bilateral pneumonia, with large numbers of patients being admitted to hospital, putting tremendous pressure on health care systems [[3], [4], [5]]. The diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on a combination of clinical symptoms with or without radiological imaging, confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 PCR [6]. Currently, either an RT-PCR targeting the envelope (E-gene) in combination with polymerase (RdRp-gene) is being used as described by Corman et al. [7] or targeting the nucleoprotein (N-gene) as described by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [8]. However several bottlenecks have been reported since its implementation. From a technical point of view, the process is time consuming with sample RNA extraction and PCR run-time of approximately 6 h and a turnaround time of 12\u221224 hours. Since providing fast results is of critical importance in a time of shortage of medical personnel, protective materials and beds on isolation wards and to insure timely and adequate treatment for patients, developing high quality rapid point of care diagnostics is essential. Antigenic tests have the potential in providing quick diagnosis, however sensitivity thus far has been lacking which makes them unreliable. Molecular point of care tests reduce the time to result from a couple of hours to less than an hour but with the same performance as real-time RT-PCR in the laboratory [9,10]. The aim of this study is to evaluate Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 random access test for use during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the Netherlands.",

A next passage was done after a freeze/thaw cycle on VERO E6 (ATCC CRL-1586)cells monolayer at 35 \u00b0C for 4 days until >90 % CPE to create a stock volume for further use. After a freeze/thaw cycle at \u221280 \u00b0C, the supernatant including cell remnants was homogenized, aliquoted and frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C. The stock virus was titrated on VERO E6 cells and found to contain 5.62*10^7 TCID50/mL (fifty-percent tissue culture infective dose) infectious virus. The virus was inactivated by incubation for 2 h at 60 \u00b0C. Inactivation was assessed by virus isolation for 7 days. No virus growth was detected by CPE and RT-PCR. The number of RdRp gene copies in the inactivated virus stock was determined by digital RT-PCR using the reverse RdRp primer for cDNA synthesis and subsequent PCR using the RT-PCR with RdRp primers and SARS-CoV-2 specific probe. The stock contains 8.26*10^8 copies RdRp positive strand RNA/mL.",

Seven of the SARS\u2212COV-2 negative specimens selected by lab 1 were positive with considerable viral load for influenza virus A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09 or B/Victoria, RSV-A, RSV-B, rhinovirus or enterovirus D68 and thereby providing additional information about the specificity of the Xpert Xpress SARS\u2212COV-2 assay. For the panel consisting of E-gene positive and RdRp-gene negative samples, most but not all were positive in the Xpert Xpress SARS\u2212COV-2. Two samples in laboratory 1 showed an N2-gene only and E-gene only result (Fig. 4\n). Specimens selected by lab 1 had lower viral load than those selected by the other two laboratories, likely because of the slight difference in sensitivity of the in-house assays (Figure 2&4). When retesting these samples in the in-house RT-PCR they were negative.",

The two samples with E-gene and N2-gene only results in Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 were retested in in-house RT-PCR, thus freeze-thawing, these turned out to be negative. This indicates that viral loads of these sample are at the limit of detection which for the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 was found to be around 8.26 cp/mL and that multiple freeze-thaw steps of samples understandably has a significant impact on detection.",

Additionally, a recent evaluation of multiple molecular point of care tests showed an LOD of 100cp/mL [[11], [12], [13]]. This discrepancy is most likely due to the different methods used for determining input concentrations. Digital PCR used to determine the number of copies per mL was performed on positive-strain genomic RNA. The RdRp PCR also detects negative strain genomic RNA and the E-gene PCR additionally detects subgenome messenger RNA which is why the true number of target templates for the diagnostic PCR in the sensitivity panel is probably higher. This could explain the differences in LOD.",
