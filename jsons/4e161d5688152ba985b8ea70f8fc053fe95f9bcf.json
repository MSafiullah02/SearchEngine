The initial interest in using combination therapies with antibiotics and serum was abandoned, as the potential benefits were marginal. Antimicrobial chemotherapy proved to be less toxic and more effective than serum therapy in the treatment of infections. However, Dr. Cohn's discovery of purified antibodies through cold ethanol fractionation of plasma during the Second World War revived the interest in antibody treatment especially for infections not able to be treated with antibiotics. The fractionation procedure stabilizes the product, denatures most viruses, and assures a more uniform antibody content. Cohn fraction (IgG from plasma after cold alcohol fractionation) was initially used for prophylaxis against prevalent and life-threatening infections, such as measles. It was not until 1952 that Bruton reported for the first time the use of immunoglobulin preparation injected subcutaneously for the treatment of a young boy with agammaglobulinemia [21] . Thereafter, the use of immunoglobulin injected intramuscularly became established as the standard therapy for primary immunodeficiencies, lasting until the development of purer and safer intravenous immunoglobulin preparation in the early 1980s [86] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1085, "end": 1089, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1337, "end": 1341, "text": "[86]", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The advent of hybridoma technology, which allows continuous generation of large quantities of monoclonal antibodies specific to antigens of interest and the generation of humanized antibodies, revolutionized antibody therapeutics [63] . Monoclonal antibody technology offers supply advantage, reduces the risks of adverse events, and decreases lot-to-lot variation. In the mid-1980s a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to CD3 was introduced into clinical practice to prevent organ rejection. Almost a decade later, the humanized mAb palivizumab (Synagis\u00ae, a humanized mouse monoclonal antibody to prevent RSV pulmonary infections in high-risk patients, especially infants) was licensed. Palivizumab was 50-fold more potent than the polyclonal product, resulting in reduced volume of administration and intramuscular use [45] . During the last three decades, 30 therapeutic mAbs have been licensed, mainly for treatment of malignancies and rheumatic or autoimmune diseases, but only two were licensed for infectious diseases (palivizumab and raxibacumab: human mAb to anthrax toxin). Although the use of mAbs to treat infectious diseases does not depend on discrimination between self-antigen as there are large antigenic differences between the microorganism and the host, the pace of discovery and development of new mAbs against infectious disease is limited. Currently, the areas of mAbs development have been focused on viral diseases without available vaccines [HIV, Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome, Marburg virus], viral disease with limited effective antiviral drugs (influenza, rabies), and bacterial toxinmediated disease (anthrax, Clostridium difficile colitis). In the clinical setting, therapeutic mAbs can be used when there are nosocomial/iatrogenic outbreaks. For example, a new approach to the prevention of recurrent C. difficile infection is the administration of mAbs against C. difficile toxins (in addition to antibiotic therapy) as a form of passive immunity. Actoxumab and bezlotoxumab are fully human monoclonal antibodies that bind and neutralize C. difficile toxins A and B, respectively. A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled phase 3 trial showed that a single intravenous dose of bezlotoxumab when given with standard-of-care antibiotics provided protection against recurrent C. difficile infection for up to 12 weeks that was superior to that provided by treatment with standard-of-care antibiotics alone [114] . Other therapeutic mAbs can be applied in drug resistance (Staphylococcus aureus, VRSA), pandemic outbreaks (Ebola virus), bioterrorism attacks (Bacillus anthracis), emerging infectious diseases (Nipah or Hendra virus), and use in high-risk host groups or in severe diseases (respiratory syncytial virus, cytomegalovirus retinitis in HIV patients, hepatitis C virus, influenza virus). Another application of therapeutic mAbs concerns their use as adjunct therapies that have anti-inflammatory or immune modulatory roles (mAbs against TNF-\u03b1 and other immune mediators) [45, 55] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 230, "end": 234, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 812, "end": 816, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 2483, "end": 2488, "text": "[114]", "ref_id": "BIBREF115"}, {"start": 3058, "end": 3062, "text": "[45,", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 3063, "end": 3066, "text": "55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Immunoglobulins are glycoprotein molecules that are produced by plasma cells in response to antigens or immunogens and which function as antibodies.

By comparison, high concentrations of IgG have anti-inflammatory properties.

Opsonic and neutralizing IgG antibody content varies with each product batch, primarily due to differences in the local pathogen ecology of donor exposure. IgG and complement proteins are the principal classes of opsonins contributing to bacterial clearance. In addition to IgG, varying amounts of immunoglobulin isotypes, especially IgA, can be found in the IVIG preparation. Regarding the different human IgG subclasses (IgG1-IgG4), IVIG preparations reflect the hierarchy present in the serum, consisting mainly of IgG1 and IgG2 and containing much smaller amounts of the other IgG subclasses.

The principal manufacturing process in all current IgG preparations is cold ethanol fractionation with product-specific additional processes for manufacturing. The commonest processes for virus reduction include solvents/detergent, low pH (pH 4), incubation, nanofiltration, and chromatography [93] . Other major quality control practices in the production process, besides viral reduction, include the depletion of blood coagulation factors and the removal of IgG aggregates, since these aggregates could result in a cytokine release syndrome owing to the ubiquitous activation of innate immune effector cells via activating Fc\u03b3Rs.
