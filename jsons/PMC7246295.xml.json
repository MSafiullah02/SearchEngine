Ultrasound is considered relatively economic, because one machine can serve many patients without the need for expensive disposables; however, the use of ultrasound in COVID-19 pandemic might spread infection through contamination of the machine and/or the close contact between the physician and the patient.",

In the early stage of the disease, disruption of pulmonary perfusion increases the vascular permeability and results in lung edema which is represented radiologically by ground glass appearance. In this stage, which is termed as L phenotype, there is a low elastance, near normal lung compliance; therefore, the patient can be ventilated at a tidal volume of 8 mL/kg (i.e., no need for extremely low tidal volume) [9]. With the disease progress, an advanced stage develops, characterized by neutrophil infiltration, marked edema, and development of lung atelectasis. This late stage of the disease, termed H phenotype, differs from the early stage in the presence of high elastance and low compliance; therefore, patients with the later phenotype are usually ventilated at high positive end-expiratory pressure and low tidal volumes [9]. As most of the fluid responsiveness tests are influenced by the tidal volume and the positive end-expiratory pressure, discrimination of the patient phenotype is necessary during evaluation for fluid responsiveness.",

The use of real-time heart\u2013lung interaction measures requires a paralyzed patient with normal right-ventricular function. Preload challenge tests are suitable for use in all patients. The passive leg raising test is relatively better than the mini-fluid challenge test, because it can be repeated without overloading the patient with fluids. Trendelenburg maneuver is a suitable alternative to the passive leg raising test in patients with prone position. The use of preload challenge tests is limited by the need to real-time CO monitor. If CO measurement was not possible, the response to the passive leg raising test could be traced by measurement of the pulse pressure, the perfusion index, or the capillary refill time. Preload modifying maneuvers, such as tidal volume challenge, can also be used in COVID-19 patients, especially if the patient was in the gray zone of other dynamic tests. However, the preload modifying maneuvers were not extensively evaluated outside the operating room. Selection of the proper test would vary according to the level of healthcare in the country and the load of admissions which might be overwhelming. Evaluation of the volume status should be comprehensive; therefore, the presence of signs of volume overload such as lower limb edema, lung edema, and severe hypoxemia should be considered beside the usual indices for fluid responsiveness.",
