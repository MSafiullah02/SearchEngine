This phylum includes the vast Clostridia class that contains, in addition to a small number of pathogens, various genera associated with gut health (e.g. Lachnospiraceae, Rumincoccaceae and Faecalibacterium). Whilst there is likely a core of genera or species conserved among most or all horses, there are marked differences in composition, even at the class level among intestinal compartments and increasing diversity towards the distal gut (Costa et al. 2015a) . Even among horses subjected to similar diet and husbandry practices, the intestinal microbiota shows a high degree of individual variation (Dougal et al. 2013; Schoster et al. 2013) . Studies in horses have demonstrated alterations in the faecal microbiota, some even at the phylum level, in disease states including colitis (Costa et al. 2012) , post partum colic (Weese et al. 2015) , chronic laminitis (Steelman et al. 2012 ) and following antimicrobial administration in healthy horses (Harlow et al. 2013; Costa et al. 2015b) . For example, in horses with undifferentiated colitis, Bacteroidetes was the most abundant phylum compared with Firmicutes in healthy control horses (Costa et al. 2012 ); meanwhile, orally-administered trimethoprim sulfadiazine (TMS) in healthy horses resulted in a drastic decrease in the members of the Verrucomicrobia phylum (Costa et al. 2015b) . Whilst data implicating alterations of the microbiota as causes of disease are currently much stronger in other species, recent equine studies have provided support to the concept that 'dysbiosis' could be an important inciting cause of various types of disease.

Rumen transfaunation remains a common treatment for a range of GI disorders in cattle (DePeters and George 2014). Whilst there are no peer-reviewed studies of FMT in horses, equine practitioners have a history of providing nasogastric (NG) administration of 'faecal tea' from healthy horses to horses with diarrhoea with anecdotal reports of success (Feary and Hassel 2006) . Additionally, there is a multitude of commercial over-the-counter probiotic products for horses used clinically in the prevention and treatment of a variety of GI disorders, attempting to provide a more 'refined' approach to microbiota replacement. While generally regarded as safe, efficacy data are limited and a recent review of probiotic use in horses highlights the need for blinded, placebocontrolled efficacy trials to investigate their health benefits (Schoster et al. 2014) . It was suggested that research emphasis should be placed on investigating the clinical outcomes related to administration of probiotic products that contain the bacterial species most abundant in the intestinal microbiota of healthy horses, species that tend to be different than those found in commercial probiotics (Schoster et al. 2014) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 198, "end": 217, "text": "(Zhang et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 564, "end": 584, "text": "(Borody et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 937, "end": 960, "text": "(Feary and Hassel 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1423, "end": 1445, "text": "(Schoster et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1765, "end": 1787, "text": "(Schoster et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The surge in interest and research on FMT follows reports of notable clinical success in treating recurrent CDI in man (Gough et al. 2011; Kassam et al. 2013; Cammarota et al. 2014) .

Much attention has been paid recently to the potential impacts of the microbiota on allergic and inflammatory conditions beyond the gut as mounting evidence clearly illustrates the role of the gut microbiota in systemic inflammation and immune tolerance (Van den Abbeele et al. 2011; Kamada et al. 2013) . Studies in germfree mice demonstrate that intestinal microbiota plays a vital role in physiological intestinal peristalsis, intestinal epithelial cell functions, development of the gut-associated immune system, systemic immunity, nutrition and metabolism (Frick and Autenrieth 2013). The GI microbiota produces antimicrobial products, competes directly for nutrients with pathogens, inhibits or inactivates bacterial toxins and produces bacteriocins and short-chain fatty acids that inhibit growth of pathogens and pathobionts (Kamada et al. 2013) .

Clostridium difficile is a normal inhabitant of the large intestine of a small percentage of healthy horses and man (Schoster et al. 2012; Petrof and Khortus 2014) . In most colonised individuals, toxigenic strains of C. difficile do not produce disease, likely through inhibitory effects of the protective commensal microbiota. However, alteration of this complex balance can result in an environment where C. difficile can proliferate, produce toxins and cause disease. Antimicrobial administration has a profound and prolonged impact on the normal intestinal microbiota in horses and man (Jakobsson et al. 2010; Stevens et al. 2011; Harlow et al. 2013; Modi et al. 2014; Costa et al. 2015b ) and has been suggested as a risk factor for CDI in both species (B averud et al. 1997; Barr et al. 2013; Petrof and Khortus 2014) . High throughput sequencing demonstrated that TMS administered per os to healthy horses had a greater effect than procaine penicillin intramuscularly (i.m.) or ceftiofur i.m. on the intestinal microbiota, with impacts on the faecal microbiota community structure persisting 25 days after the end of treatment (study endpoint) for all antibiotic-treated horses (Costa et al. 2015b) . Other risk factors for CDI in horses include stressors such as transportation, hospitalisation, presurgical fasting, medical, or surgical treatment of GI or other disorders (B averud et al. 1997) .

When conventional treatment (e.g. cessation of the inciting antimicrobial and use of antibiotics against C. difficile) fails, FMT may be an effective means of restoring the normal intestinal microbiota and treating CDI, particularly recurrent CDI. Potential mechanisms of action of FMT include competition for limited resources, direct elimination of C. difficile, interference with its pathogenicity by microbial products that neutralise toxins, restoration of secondary bile acid metabolism in colon and induction of immunemediated resistance (Britton and Young 2014; Petrof and Khortus 2014) . Some studies indicate that human patients receiving FMT for treatment of recurrent CDI commonly have clinical resolution of diarrhoea before they have evidence of faecal microbiota recovery (Khoruts et al. 2010; van Nood et al. 2013; Song et al. 2013) suggesting that the resolution of diarrhoea is related to factors other than full restoration of gut microbiota as represented by the faecal microbiota (a reasonable but incomplete proxy for the proximal intestinal tract). If stable engraftment of transplanted microbes occurs, it may take some time to achieve. Alternatively, the key for clinical resolution may not be development of an overall microbiota akin to the donor but restoration of key components (e.g. Lachnospiraceae). The potential mechanisms by which FMT improves outcome in other GI and non-GI disorders are being actively investigated, as is the determination of the direction of causality and reversibility of these conditions (Aroniadis and Brandt 2013; Smits et al. 2013; Khoruts and Weingarden 2014) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 157, "end": 176, "text": "(Rupnik et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 725, "end": 749, "text": "(Britton and Young 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 750, "end": 774, "text": "Petrof and Khortus 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 967, "end": 988, "text": "(Khoruts et al. 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 989, "end": 1010, "text": "van Nood et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1011, "end": 1028, "text": "Song et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 1725, "end": 1752, "text": "(Aroniadis and Brandt 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1753, "end": 1771, "text": "Smits et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1772, "end": 1800, "text": "Khoruts and Weingarden 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Potential mechanisms of action of faecal microbiota transplant to treat Clostridium difficile infection"}, {"text": "Faecal enemas were used infrequently starting in the 1950s for treatment of pseudomembranous enterocolitis, a condition now thought to be associated with CDI (Khoruts and Weingarden 2014) .

As hindgut fermenters, horses have an intestinal tract profoundly different from man and ruminants. The types of chronic disease usually targeted by FMT in those species also have little relationship to important problems in horses. Due to the long small colon in the horse, FMT via enema may not be effective and to the authors' knowledge has not been investigated. Faecal microbiota transplant in horses has thus far been limited to administration via NG intubation. Efficacy of this route may be reduced due to bacterial inhibition and degradation by gastric acid, small intestinal enzymatic digestion and competition and degradation in the caecum due to fermentation. Therefore, while the clear impact of FMT in man and rumen transfaunation provides proof of concept, equine specific study is required. In a small case series, 3 out 4 horses with antibiotic-induced or undifferentiated colitis had an improvement in faecal consistency following treatment with FMT (Mullen et al. 2014 ). One author (T.J.D.) used fresh caecal transfaunation successfully in a horse with severe, subacute CDI, with normal manure consistency returning 12 h post treatment. Chronic diarrhoea, although uncommon in the horse, has anecdotally responded to treatment with FMT (Feary and Hassel 2006; McGovern 2013) . Caecal contents collected from a recently deceased horse or faeces obtained from rectal evacuation of a healthy horse provided the transfaunate (Feary and Hassel 2006) .
