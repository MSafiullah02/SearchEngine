Key amino acids in these proteins, especially in HA, are associated with host specificity and transmissibility in humans. Aquatic birds are the natural reservoir of influenza A viruses, harboring all possible subtypes, except H17, H18, N10, and N11. These were recently identified in bats, suggesting birds are not the only reservoir. A selection of subtypes has established endemicity among land and water mammals (e.g., humans, pigs, horses, seals; Fig. 33.1\n). Influenza B and C viruses are mainly human pathogens, with rare reports of influenza B virus infection in dogs, cats, swine, and seals. Influenza C rarely causes human infections, and influenza D viruses mostly infect cattle and will not be further discussed.",

New human viruses have emerged through antigenic drift in avian viruses (1918 Spanish flu: H1N1, 40\u2013100 million deaths) or through reassortment of gene segments in animal hosts infected with two different viruses (antigenic shift; 1957 Asian flu: H2N2, 2 million deaths; 1968 Hong Kong flu: H3N2, 500,000 deaths). After such an introduction, the new virus becomes the dominant circulating lineage. Two notable exceptions were the reintroduction of H1N1 in the human population in 1977, possibly caused by an escape from a research laboratory, and the introduction in 2009 of a novel lineage of H1N1 influenza A virus, most likely from pigs, in North America, causing a relatively mild pandemic (with an estimated 100,000\u2013400,000 deaths) and generating massive attention from both the public health communities and the general public and replacing only the 1977 H1N1 lineage. Currently, H1N1pdm09 and H3N2 influenza A virus are co-circulating with influenza B viruses and continue to cause yearly seasonal epidemics worldwide. The timing, extent, and direction of either \u201cdrift\u201d or \u201cshift\u201d have so far been completely unpredictable. With no animal reservoirs to provide such new antigens, shift does not occur in influenza B and thus major epidemics do not occur (Fig. 33.2\n).1, 2\n",

The virus, called Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, has since caused >2100 infections, 750 of which were fatal, in 27 countries. Most cases originated from countries in the Arabian peninsula with rare travel-related spillovers, including one that caused a large health care facility\u2013related outbreak in South Korea in 2015. More mild and asymptomatic cases are observed with MERS, and mortality is strongly associated with age and co-morbidities. The natural reservoir of MERS coronavirus is dromedary camels, and in Saudi Arabia half of cases are classified as primary, often associated with collection, preparation, and ingestion of milk or meat. The other half results from human-to-human transmission, often associated with health care facilities. Control of MERS coronavirus is difficult because of the stable natural reservoir and the presence of asymptomatic human spreaders. Vaccination of dromedary camels was proposed as an efficient intervention, but unfortunately neutralizing antibodies do not appear to protect against infection or viral shedding.6, 16\n",
