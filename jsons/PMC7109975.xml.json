This variant strain replicated normally, as assessed by cytopathic effect and quantitative viral cultures, compared with the wildtype virus. After 48 h of incubation, virus titers in the supernatant medium from MRC-5 cells infected with wild-type virus were 2.8 \u00b1 0.4 TCID50/mL, compared with 2.4 \u00b1 0.5 TCID50/mL in medium from cells infected with the variant strain. The variant strain was neutralized by type-specific antiserum to RV39, and replication was inhibited by pretreatment of cells with anti-ICAM antibody (data not shown). The variant strain of rhinovirus did not induce oxidative stress in MRC-5 cells, as determined by hydrogen peroxide production. Hydrogen peroxide concentrations in supernatant medium from control and rhinovirus-challenged MRC-5 cells were 1.18 \u00b1 0.43 and 5.3 \u00b11.4 \u03bcM, respectively, whereas the supernatant from MRC-5 cells challenged with RV39vs contained 0.89 \u00b1 0.18 \u03bcM H2O2. Similarly, the RV39vs did not produce oxidative stress in BEAS-2B cells, as determined by NBT dye reduction or by fluorescence staining of carbonyl groups (data not shown). In contrast to wild-type RV39, challenge of cells with this virus in vitro was not associated with activation of NF-\u03bcB (data not shown) or with IL-8 elaboration in either MRC-5 cells or BEAS-2B cells (figure 2). Challenge of MRC-5 cells with wildtype RV39 and RV39vs simultaneously resulted in IL-8 levels comparable to those seen after challenge with RV39 alone, suggesting that the RV39vs was not inhibiting cellular elaboration of IL-8. The observations that inhibition of viral replication with anti-ICAM antibody does not affect IL-8 elaboration and that the variant strain replicates normally but does not produce an IL-8 response suggest that virus-induced oxidative stress and IL-8 elaboration are independent of attachment to ICAM-1 or viral replication.",

Pretreatment of fibroblasts with DPI (40 \u03bcM) reduced Superoxide anion production and virusinduced IL-8 elaboration (figure 3). The reduction in oxidative stress was also demonstrated by decreased H2O2 production. Hydrogen peroxide concentrations in supernatant medium from control and rhinovirus-challenged MRC-5 cells were 1.18 \u00b1 0.43 and 5.3 \u00b1 1.4\u03bcM, respectively. The supernatant from MRC-5 cells challenged with rhinovirus in the presence of DPI (40 \u03bcM) contained 0.48 \u00b1 0.18 \u03bcM H2O2. A similar inhibitory effect of DPI was seen in BEAS-2B cells. The IL-8 concentration in medium from BEAS-2B cells challenged with rhinovirus was reduced from 246 \u00b1 25 to 121 \u00b1 20 pg/mL by pretreatment with 40 \u03bcM DPI. The IL-8 concentrations in medium from BEAS-2B cells without viral challenge were 144 \u00b1 15 pg/mL without DPI and 97 \u00b1 11 pg/mL with DPI. The reduction in IL-8 elaboration after treatment with DPI was associated with a reduction in viral replication, as measured by quantitative viral cultures of supernatant medium collected 48 h after challenge (figure 4). Treatment of the cells with Mn-TBAP, which mimics the activity of Superoxide dismutase, in hibited oxidative stress and IL-8 elaboration in response to viral challenge but had no effect on viral replication. These observations suggest that the inhibition of viral replication by DPI was not a result of the inhibition of oxidative stress. Similar effects of DPI on virus-induced IL-8 elaboration and viral replication were seen after challenge of fibroblasts with either RSV or coronavirus 229E. RSV challenge in the presence of DPI (40 \u03bcM) resulted in an IL-8 concentration and virus titer in supernatant medium of 74 \u00b1 10 pg/mL and 0.85 \u00b1 0.09 TCID50/mL, respectively, compared with 1139 \u00b1 118 pg/mL and 3.83 \u00b1 0.12 TCID50/mL in control cells. Similarly, coronavirus challenge in the presence of DPI resulted in an IL-8 concentration and virus titer of 69 \u00b1 20 pg/mL and 0.5 \u00b1 0.001 TCID50/mL, respectively, compared with 1053 \u00b1 51 pg/mL and 3.9 \u00b1 0.13 TCID50/mL in control cells.

Pretreatment of cells with DPI completely blocked the oxidative response to rhinovirus challenge as measured by NBT dye reduction (figure 5). Similarly, DPI pretreatment inhibited rhinovirus-induced elaboration of IL-8. IL-8 concentrations in the p47-phox-deficient cells without viral challenge were 40 \u00b1 14 pg/mL, compared with 158 \u00b1 54 pg/mL after rhinovirus challenge. Rhinovirus challenge of these cells after pretreatment with DPI (40 \u03bcM), allopurinol (500 \u03bcM), or rotenone (10 \u03bcM) resulted in IL-8 concentrations of 13.4 \u00b1 2.2, 323 \u00b1 100, and 186 \u00b1 104 pg/mL, respectively.

Previous studies had suggested that prevention of rhinovirus replication by blockade of attachment to ICAM-1 or UV inactivation of virus prevented virus-associated IL-8 elaboration [14]. These previous studies differed from our studies in that IL-8 elaboration was measured 24 h after challenge of the cell monolayer with a relatively low inoculum of virus. Under these conditions, virus-cell interaction by progeny virus produced as a result of viral replication presumably makes a substantial contribution to the IL-8 detected in the supernatant. Thus, inhibition of viral replication that eliminates this amplification would cause a corresponding reduction in IL-8 concentration. In our study, the effect of this amplification was eliminated by measurement of IL-8 in supernatants collected only 6 h after challenge of the monolayer with a large inoculum of virus. Our observations that a variant strain of RV39 replicates normally in fibroblast and BEAS-2B cells but does not cause oxidative stress or IL-8 elaboration is further evidence that viral attachment to ICAM-1 and subsequent replication events are not required for these processes.",

In contrast, inhibition of xanthine oxidase, cyclooxygenase, or mitochondrial metabolism had no effect on rhinovirus-induced IL-8 elaboration. These observations sug gested that an NADPH oxidase-like enzyme might be the source of the virus-induced oxidative stress. Further evaluation making use of skin fibroblasts from subjects with known defects in NADPH oxidase suggested that p47-phox may be involved in this process.",

Although these two proteins have been detected in nonmyeloid cells [15\u201317], recent evidence suggests that the oxidase responsible for production of reactive oxygen species in signal transduction pathways of nonmyeloid cells may in fact be part of a family of enzymes closely related to NADPH oxidase [18, 19].",

Both p47-phox and p67-phox have been identified in rat and rabbit aortic fibroblasts and in guinea pig gastric mucosal cells [15, 17, 20]. Furthermore, depletion of p67-phox from rabbit aortic fibroblasts by immunoprecipitation resulted in a loss of NADPH oxidase activity in a cell-free assay [15]. Viral challenge of skin fibroblasts from a patient with deficient p47-phox was associated with a substantial decrease in the production of reactive oxygen species and in IL-8 elaboration, compared with normal controls. However, comparison of virus-challenged cells with unchallenged control cells revealed that the p47-phox-deficient cells did respond to the viral challenge and this response was inhibited by pretreatment with DPI but not by allopurinol or rotenone. These observations suggest either that another flavoprotein enzyme system contributes to the response to viral challenge or that the need for p47-phox is not an absolute requirement for partial functioning of the fibroblast NADPH oxidase system [21, 22].",
