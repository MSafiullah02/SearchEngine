Recent studies report that the new SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell entry, followed by proteolytic cleavage of the S protein by TMPRSS2 allowing the fusion of viral and cellular membranes15\n,\n16. Moreover, in vitro evidence indicates that TMPRSS2 inhibition by camostat mesylate may be beneficial to prevent the infection of SARS-CoV-215.",

Intriguingly, it has been shown that AR regulates TMPRSS2 expression also in non-prostatic tissues, including lung. In vitro and in vivo results show that androgen administration induces TMPRSS2 expression in human lung epithelial cells and that androgen deprivation reduces TMPRSS2 transcription in murine lung19. The androgen-dependent regulation of TMPRSS2 expression in the lung may explain the increased susceptibility of men to develop SARS-CoV-2 severe infections when compared to women.",

The parameters used for each patient positive to COVID-19 were: gender, hospitalized (yes/no), admission to intensive care unit (ICU) (yes/no), death, tumor diagnosis, diagnosis of prostate cancer, and androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). The primary end-point of the study was to assess the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 1) patients affected by cancer, 2) patients affected by prostate cancer, 3) patients affected by prostate cancer in therapy with or without ADT, and 4) to assess the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the categories above based on patients\u2019 hospitalization, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), or death. Statistical evaluation of the strength of the association between SARS-CoV-2 cases and different types of tumor patients in the male population of the Veneto Region was obtained by means of Odds Ratio (OR). Data were considered also after stratification for the severity of the disease. 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for OR was obtained using the Miettinen-Nurminen method20. P-value was calculated according to Sheskin21. Comparisons among frequencies were obtained with the chi-square test. Statistical significance was considered for P< 0.05.",

This suggests novel potential therapeutic interventions to treat COVID-19-affected people. Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is known to decrease the levels of TMPRSS231, and AR antagonists could be used to block or decrease the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in male patients, potentially in combination with other inhibitors of viral entry or replication. In addition, other drugs that interfere with positive regulation of TMPRSS2 by AR, AR co-regulatory factors, and transcription factors (e.g., ETS, SP1) could be used to downregulate TMPRSS2 expression and activity in lung and other tissues32, 33, 34, 35, 36. Besides the regulation of TMPRSS2, androgens could also increase the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in males by modulating the immune response. Androgens can increase the number and function of circulating neutrophils, increase the production of IL-1\u03b2, IL-10, IL-2, and TGF\u03b2 by immune cells, and decrease the antibody response to viral infections37. In this respect, it is worth noticing that recent evidence demonstrates that neutrophils are responsible for the cytokine storm syndrome, observed in patients with severe COVID-1937,38. Besides androgens, other steroid hormones (e.g., estrogen, glucocorticoids) may enhance TMPRSS2 expression through binding of their respective nuclear receptors to responsive elements (e.g., ERE, GRE) in the gene promoter, thereby explaining the severity of infections in some cases of female patients39\n,\n40. Therefore, inhibition of these regulatory pathways through already available therapies, may also decrease the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our data are in line with recent reports from China that demonstrated similar trends in male patients and those with cancer24.",
