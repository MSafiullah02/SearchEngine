Disease, however, has been shown to aff ect survival, reproduction, and movement in host populations, and to aff ect community structure in turn (reviewed in Sco\u0134 1988) . At the same time, emergent diseases are more common because of an expanding human population, associated growth of domestic animal populations, increased travel and commerce, human alteration of habitats, and global climate change (Daszak et al. 2000) . Outbreaks of \"mad cow disease\" (bovine spongiform encephalopathy; Brown et al. 2001) , foot-and-mouth disease (Picornaviridae: Aphthovirus; Kitching 1999), West Nile virus (Flavivirus; Lancio\u0134 i et al. 1999) , SARS (Coronavirus), monkeypox (Orthopoxvirus), and avian infl uenza (Orthomyxoviridae) have demonstrated the virulence of some pathogens and their potential to cross over to new hosts, including humans. Thus, interest grows in the dynamics of infectious diseases in wildlife (Daszak et al. 2000 , Friend et al. 2001 , especially in threatened species, as we recognize the potential for disease to limit populations ( Thorne and Williams 1988, Deem et al. 2001) .",

Founders likely carry only a subset of the parasites found in the donor population, and virulent pathogens that need large host populations may be lost quickly (Dobson and May 1986, Dobson 1988) .

Their isolation and relative desolation delayed their permanent colonization by humans until the 1800s, and their biodiversity remains mostly intact, only \u223c5% of species having been lost (Gibbs et al. 1999) ; 26 of 28 breeding landbird species are endemic, and there have been no extinctions of bird species. Currently, humans occupy only 4 of the 11 main islands, and most of those 4 islands and the remainder of the archipelago have been protected as the Gal\u00e1pagos National Park and Marine Reserve since the 1950s. However, the resident human population has grown rapidly and exotic species are continually being introduced despite increasing eff orts to exclude them. The Charles Darwin Foundation and the Gal\u00e1pagos National Park fear the introduction of avian diseases that could result in extinctions of Gal\u00e1pagos avifauna, similar to what happened in Hawaii (Warner 1968; van Riper et al. 1986 van Riper et al. , 2002 Wikelski et al. 2004) . The appearance of avianpox-like lesions in domestic chickens (Gallus gallus) on the islands, and then in endemic birds, heightened concerns regarding the possibility of disease transmission from introduced birds to endemics. In fact, it was presumed that pox was brought to the archipelago via chickens in the 20th century (Grant et al. 2000) . In the mid-1980s, the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, a vector of avian malaria, was reported from Gal\u00e1pagos, and its establishment has recently been confi rmed (Whiteman et al. 2005) . To date, however, the especially pathogenic strains of avian malaria of the genus Plasmodium have not been found. We have undertaken a large project, in collaboration with the Gal\u00e1pagos National Park and the Charles Darwin Foundation, to monitor disease status of Gal\u00e1pagos avian endemics and introduced birds. Partnering with international experts on major taxonomic groups of parasites, we use morphological and molecular approaches to identify organisms. We pursue phylogeographic studies to understand the history of the parasite lineages on the archipelago, and the relationships among parasite lineages and among parasites and host species. The result is a multilayered program examining the interplay between hosts and parasites and the behavioral ecology of both hosts and pathogens, which provides valuable information to the managers of this World Heritage Site and adds new dimensions to the study of evolutionary ecology of all Gal\u00e1pagos organisms, regardless of their body size.",

Lectures covered the biology of avian pathogens and diagnostic symptoms of major avian diseases; hands-on workshops trained participants in phlebotomy for disease testing, smears for blood parasites, and necropsy protocol. Subjects were domestic chickens from local farms and Rock Pigeons (Columba livia) from extermination programs, on the human-inhabited islands of Santa Cruz and San Cristobal. In addition, we began the fi eld surveys of natural populations of endemic birds. During the fi rst two years, plasma and serum samples, blood smears, and cloacal swabs were sampled from Waved Albatrosses (Phoebastria irrorata), endemic to the island of Espa\u00f1ola (Padilla et al. 2003) ; Gal\u00e1pagos Hawks (Buteo galapagoensis) from eight islands; Gal\u00e1pagos Doves (Zenaida galapagoensis) from fi ve islands (three uninhabited by humans and two inhabited; Padilla et al. 2004) ; and from Gal\u00e1pagos Penguins (Spheniscus mendiculus) and Gal\u00e1pagos Flightless Cormorants (Phalacrocorax harrisi) across their narrow ranges within the archipelago (Travis et al. 2006a, b) . Sampling was later extended to other species (see below). These endemic species were chosen because we were already involved in studies of their population biology and genetics. They represented two terrestrial species (one of which is the apex predator on the islands) and three marine species (one of which is pelagic and covers huge distances, the other two of which are fl ightless), and so could be seen as sentinel species for a large proportion of the ecological zones inhabited by birds in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. In addition, all are relatively largebodied, so suffi cient samples could be taken to test for several pathogens. These ongoing population studies provided a background against which data on disease could be interpreted more fully. For example, our population-genetics studies show that the Gal\u00e1pagos Hawk is the most recent arrival of the endemic vertebrates on the archipelago (Bollmer et al. 2006) , that since its arrival it has diversifi ed rapidly among island populations, and that individuals very rarely move among islands (Bollmer et al. 2005) . By contrast, the genes of Gal\u00e1pagos Doves move freely among the islands of the main archipelago (Santiago-Alarc\u00f3n et al. 2006) . Similar studies are underway for the penguins and cormorants. These data contribute to understanding the timing of arrival of hosts and their host-specifi c pathogens, their historical interisland movements, and the current dynamics of transmission of pathogens among islands and species. For example, comparison of hawks and doves suggests that the doves are far more likely to distribute pathogens among islands.",

We broadened the fi eld survey to include four seabird species on Genovesa and other island populations of landbirds. Upon capture, birds are handled briefl y while morphological measures are made and ocular, choanal, and cloacal swabs are taken.

Although dust-ruffl ing does not remove all ectoparasites (e.g., many mites), it is relatively noninvasive and allows a good estimation of ectoparasite infection intensity and prevalence (Walther and Clayton 1997). Ectoparasites are placed in 95-100% ethanol and stored at -20\u00b0C to ensure DNA preservation. DNA is extracted from exemplars from each host species or population, depending on the particular requirements of the study. A voucher method, in which an exoskeleton is retained as a voucher specimen, is used (Cruickshank et al. 2001 , Whiteman et al. 2004 ). In the case of hippoboscid fl ies or other relatively large arthropods, a single leg is removed. DNA is extracted and used as a source of template DNA for PCRs. Arthropod-specifi c PCR primers are then used to amplify and sequence loci to be used in population or phylogenetic studies (e.g., the 5' end of the cytochrome-c oxidase subunit I [COI] is used as a DNA barcode; Hebert et al. 2003) .

Thus, we can quantify the large amount of parasite diversity endemic to the Gal\u00e1pagos avifauna, which hopefully will encourage studies of other vertebrate groups that harbor their own unique parasite lineages (e.g., reptiles: Ayala and Hutchings 1974).",

Chlamydophila psi\u0134 aci antibodies were also detected at high prevalence in Gal\u00e1pagos Penguin; lower prevalences of C. psi\u0134 aci in the sympatric Gal\u00e1pagos Cormorant may have refl ected the diff erent testing methodologies used. Chlamydophila DNA was detected in several cormorants, but in no penguins (Travis et al. 2006a, b) . Histopathology of cutaneous lesions from chickens, Yellow Warblers, and ground fi nches (Geospiza spp.) revealed inclusion bodies diagnostic of Avipoxvirus spp. Our characterization of the poxvirus in endemic passerine birds revealed two variants very closely related to canarypox virus, whereas domestic chickens on the islands are infected with the distinct fowlpox virus (Thiel et al. 2005) . This suggests that the poxvirus did not \"jump\" from chickens to the endemic birds. Canarypox variants may also be endemic, perhaps arriving with avian colonists that gave rise to the endemic Gal\u00e1pagos avifauna, or transported by migrant passerines. Recombination analyses, however, indicated ancient recombination among all strains examined, which suggests that recombination could occur among sympatric Avipoxvirus strains in Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. Further phylogeographic studies of the virus in the endemic birds should clarify its closest relatives on the mainland.

These parasites vary markedly in life history and host specifi city in ways that we have investigated in our studies (see below). Opportunistic samples from other species have recovered unidentifi ed mites and lice of genera Brueelia and Myrsidea. Other researchers have reported ectoparasites from Gal\u00e1pagos birds as well (e.g., Palma 1995 , Madden and Harmon 1998 , Mironov and Perez 2002 , Price et al. 2003 , O'Connor et al. 2005 .

Most data on the eff ects of avian pox are from mockingbirds (Nesomimus spp.). During the 1982-1983 El Ni\u00f1o event, 56% of Gal\u00e1pagos Mockingbirds displaying lesions died on Genovesa, compared with 39% of asymptomatic individuals (Curry and Grant 1989). During the same El Ni\u00f1o event on Isla Santa Cruz, 28% of juvenile Gal\u00e1pagos Mockingbirds exhibited apparent pox lesions; young birds without symptoms had higher resighting frequencies (72%) than those with lesions (0%), which suggested higher mortality for infected birds (Vargas 1987). Our work has barely begun to consider the health consequences of parasites and pathogens on their hosts. Hemoparasites in Haemoproteus have been traditionally considered incidental and relatively nonpathogenic parasites of birds and reptiles, though eff ects on host fi tness have been demonstrated (Earl\u00eb et al. 1993 , Merino et al. 2000 , Marzal et al. 2005 ) and pathogenicity has been shown for certain hosts of certain hemoparasite species (Garvin et al. 2003) . The pathogenicity of these parasites in the seabirds and doves sampled, or the eff ects on host fi tness or reproductive success, are unknown. However, within Great Frigatebirds, birds infected with Haemoproteus-like parasites exhibited signifi cantly higher heterophil-tolymphocyte concentration ratios than uninfected birds (Padilla et al. 2006) . In chickens, this ratio increased when birds were exposed to social stress or corticosterone in feed, and it is thus considered to be an indication of environmental stress (Gross and Siegel 1983) . In our studies, blood smears from each bird are used to identify circulating parasites and to conduct complete cell counts (i.e., heterophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils), and estimate concentrations of overall leukocytes, each leukocyte type, and heterophil-tolymphocyte concentration ratios. Haptoglobin, an acute phase protein found in birds and other taxa (Delers et al. 1988) , will be quantifi ed using a serum assay available through Tri-Delta Diagnostics (Morris Plains, New Jersey) that we have used with success. Haptoglobin increases during infl ammatory responses to trauma or infection. Blood chemistries will be quantifi ed through commercial labs (Padilla et al. 2003 (Padilla et al. , 2004 (Padilla et al. , 2006 Travis et al. 2006a, b) . We will compare these measures of response in infected and noninfected hosts within each species, and compare these diff erentials between \"old\" and \"recent\" parasites, as identifi ed in our phylogeographic studies. For high-prevalence parasites in particular populations, we will return to estimate resighting rates of hosts between years to estimate parasite-related mortality. Eventually, we and our colleagues would like to experimentally treat nesting nonthreatened birds (e.g., Great Frigatebirds) with antimalarial drugs to determine their ecological cost (e.g., Merino et al. 2000 , Marzal et al. 2005 . We are presently studying how removing lice from banded Gal\u00e1pagos Hawks aff ects the hawks' long-term survivorship.",

            "text": "We will also use these results to estimate consequences of parasite infection for other components of fi tness in the endemic avifauna of Gal\u00e1pagos. These studies will make connections back to our original interests in behavioral characteristics of island fauna. We will ask, for example, whether parasite infection aff ects the red coloration of the Red-footed Booby's (S. Sula) feet, and whether this, in turn, aff ects mating success (P. Baiao pers. comm.). We know that the high prevalence of adenovirus seropositivity in the Waved Albatross is not related to their pairing or reproductive success (K. P. Huyvaert pers. comm.), but we are aware that some of these disease organisms may have adverse fi tness consequences for their hosts in a manner that is mediated through behavioral mechanisms such as pairing success or foraging effi ciency, even when direct eff ects on morbidity are diffi cult to assess. For example, we have studied the ectoparasitic lice Degeeriella regalis and Colpocephalum turbinatum of the endemic Gal\u00e1pagos Hawk. Number of lice per infected host correlates negatively with body condition and predicts territory status, such that nonterritorial birds carry higher parasite loads and are in poorer condition than territorial birds, even a\u011e er controlling for age (Whiteman and Parker 2004a) . New data suggest that newcomers to polyandrous Gal\u00e1pagos Hawk breeding groups on Santiago have significantly more lice than birds that have resided in the territories for at least one year, which is likely correlated with the newer birds' recent status as nonterritorial individuals (N. K. Whiteman et al. unpubl. data) . In addition, the intensity of infection with the horizontally transmi\u0134 ed louse, C. turbinatum, varied positively with size of the infected Gal\u00e1pagos Hawk's social group, and intensity was signifi cantly more similar within groups than between groups. This was not true for the vertically transmi\u0134 ed D. regalis (Whiteman and Parker 2004b) . Colpocephalum turbinatum is the same louse that is useful for indicating relative immune function of diff erent populations, because it encounters the immune system when it feeds on skin and growing feathers. We asked whether genetic diversity, parasite load, and immune function were related across all the breeding populations of the Gal\u00e1pagos Hawk, employing our quantitative sampling of C. turbinatum, estimates of island-population genetic diversity (Bollmer et al. 2005) , and tests of natural constitutive antibodies (Matson et al. 2005 ) run on banked serum samples from the same individuals. We found that island populations of Gal\u00e1pagos Hawks with extremely li\u0134 le genetic diversity also have generally lower and less variable natural antibody titres and higher ectoparasite loads than larger, more genetically variable island populations (Whiteman et al. 2006) . This reinforces the hypothesis that extinction risk of island endemics is a\u0134 ributable to mechanisms associated with reduced genetic diversity (Frankham 1996) . Because of this fi nding, we recommended that the Gal\u00e1pagos National Park consider further restricting tourist visitation to the more isolated smaller islands, given that Gal\u00e1pagos Hawks on those islands are likely more susceptible to invasive diseases that may enter the archipelago.",

            "text": "Parasites that are not directly aff ected by host immune function reveal other aspects of the host-parasite interaction. Degeeriella regalis is a feather louse that occurs, within the islands, only on Gal\u00e1pagos Hawks. On the mainland, it occurs with regularity only on the Gal\u00e1pagos Hawk's putative sister species, the Swainson's Hawk (B. swainsoni; Riesing et al. 2003 ). This parasite is likely transmi\u0134 ed vertically between host individuals (Whiteman and Parker 2004a), transferring between parents and off spring during brooding. Comparative molecular data (N. K. Whiteman et al. unpubl. data) suggest that the parasite's mtDNA was diversifying more quickly than the host's under an island model of speciation (Hafner and Nadler 1990). We conservatively estimated that the Gal\u00e1pagos Hawk split from its common ancestor with the Swainson's Hawk <200,000 years BP and is, thus, the youngest known endemic bird lineage with the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands (Bollmer et al. 2006) . The signature of a population bo\u0134 leneck in the hawk lineage is seen at rapidly evolving nuclear minisatellite loci, which are nearly fi xed within and diff erent between island populations of the Gal\u00e1pagos Hawk (Bollmer et al. 2005) and in the mtDNA haplotype network, which shows very li\u0134 le polymorphism, yet high structure (Bollmer et al. 2006 ). However, the parasite mtDNA network shows much more structure between and variability within island populations (N. K. Whiteman et al. unpubl. data). Because it is vertically trans-mi\u0134 ed and highly host-specifi c, such parasites act as rapidly evolving \"markers\" that provide more insight into host history than we can get from the hosts themselves. The parasite network reveals aspects of host history (which haplotypes are derived from which ancestral [Auk, Vol. 123 haplotype), and we used this logic as a new rationale for parasite conservation (Whiteman and Parker 2005) .",

Our ongoing work will continue to uncover parasite lineages new to science. For example, there are no published reports of Phthiraptera from the following endemic birds, though each is a likely host to at least one species (Price et al. 2003) : Lava Gull (L. fuliginosus), Gal\u00e1pagos Rail (Laterallus spilonotus), eight species of Darwin's fi nches (Geospiza spp.), three mockingbird species (Nesomimus spp.), Gal\u00e1pagos Martin (Progne modesta), Gal\u00e1pagos subspecies of the Short-eared Owl (Asio fl ammeus), and others. Although two species of lice were reported previously from the Gal\u00e1pagos Hawk (de Vries 1973), our sampling (a\u011e er receiving a tip from R. Palma) revealed that a previously undetected head louse, Craspedorrhynchus sp. (all in this genus are specifi c to raptors), which occurred in all island populations sampled, likely represents an endemic lineage. The detection of cryptic diversifi cation within the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, in addition to new species or new records, is certain. For example, an epidermoptid skin mite (a member of a family in which no DNA sequence data existed before our preliminary study), Myialges caulotoon, was previously reported from Flightless Cormorants and Gal\u00e1pagos Hawks, both Gal\u00e1pagos endemics (Madden and Harmon 1998). These mites have caused signifi cant mortality in wild birds elsewhere, including an island endemic (Gilardi et al. 2001) . Previously, however, only one specimen was collected from a Flightless Cormorant, and only morphological characters were used to identify these mites (Madden and Harmon 1998) . Female mites of the genus Myialges are obligately vectored by hippoboscid fl ies or large chewing louse species (Fain 1965) and oviposit only on the insects. However, diff erent species of fl ies infest Flightless Cormorants and Gal\u00e1pagos Hawks (Maa 1963, N. K. Whiteman et al. unpubl. data) . Thus, we hypothesized that gene fl ow of the mites between avian hosts was limited given the host-specifi city of their fl y vectors. We showed that individuals of Myialges from Flightless Cormorants and Gal\u00e1pagos Hawks diff ered signifi cantly genetically even in areas where those two species co-occurred (e.g., Isla Fernandina). Our collaborator and expert on the Acari, H. Klompen, found consistent morphological diff erences between the series from each host, demonstrating the reciprocal illumination with morphological and molecular data to uncover new parasite lineages.",

Island populations may be particularly infl uenced by introduced pathogens because of their evolution in isolation, low levels of genetic heterogeneity, and increased population densities, all of which increase their susceptibility to new diseases and disease transmission among individuals. Also, island populations naturally tend to be small, making them more vulnerable to extinction. In addition, the parasites themselves are of extreme intrinsic value and interest. This partnership is describing the prevalence of parasites in terrestrial bird species and seabirds on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, assessing the history and origin of those parasite lineages, and beginning to assess the relative eff ects of recent and historical parasites on their hosts. In addition, we can use the empirical clinical data on health of individuals to inform our behavioral-ecology studies of mate choice, territory acquisition, reproductive success, and pa\u0134 erns of movement. These results may contribute importantly to other conservation eff orts in other parts of the world. The results will also contribute a new dimension to the role that the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago has served as evolution's laboratory by revealing the diversity of parasites that have evolved there, and are enabling us to begin quantifying the eff ects of both endemic and introduced parasites and pathogens.",

Chickens interact closely with wild birds, and these parasites infect wild relatives of Gal\u00e1pagos endemics elsewhere (Dubey 2002, Forrester and Spalding 2003). Clearly, domestic chickens harbor pathogens, but the threat that these pose to the endemic avifauna is unclear. The population of introduced Rock Pigeons on the island of San Cristobal harbored Trichomonas (44%) in 2002 (Padilla et al. 2004). Chickens on Santa Cruz and San Cristobal habor fowlpox virus identical to that from chickens elsewhere (Thiel et al. 2005).",
