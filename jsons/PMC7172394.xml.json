His personal history included paranoid schizophrenia, a history of intravenous drug use with current enrollment in an official drug substitution program, structural epilepsy, and chronic hepatitis C. Amoxicillin with clavulanic acid and clarithromycin was prescribed for suspected pneumonia and he was admitted to the normal ward. Within a short time his respiratory function deteriorated rapidly and he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for intubation. Antibiotic therapy was escalated to piperacillin/tazobactam. Initially, the patient presented with a clinical picture suggesting septic shock with hyperdynamic cardiocirculatory failure due to marked vasoplegia. Differentiated catecholamine and volume therapy was started. Bilateral pleural effusions were drained. Over the ensuing days, his condition stabilized, a decline in inflammation parameters was observed and catecholamine support was stopped. Cultures of respiratory specimens were without growth.",

No quantitative PCR was performed in case 2 but the cycle threshold (CT) values by qualitative real-time PCR were very low in BAL (15.2) and in plasma (19.7), which corresponds to a high virus load in both specimen types, with the virus load in BAL higher than in plasma, similar to case 1. In both cases adenovirus was isolated by viral culture on A549 cells and initial typing by partial sequencing of the hexon gene [12] resulted in HAdV-B21. Complete genomic sequencing confirmed these results and identified this virus as subtype 21a (see Fig. 2\n). In case 1, adenovirus DNA was also quantified in autoptic tissue specimens. The adenovirus DNA concentration was high in specimens of the left and right lung (74 and 312 copies of adenovirus DNA/cell, respectively) and low (<0.1 copies/cell) in all other organs and tissues (liver, kidney, spleen, stomach, jejunum, colon, pancreas, thyroid, lymph node) tested, with exception of the pancreas, which had a virus load of 4 copies/cell. These results indicate that adenovirus replication in this case was almost completely limited to the lung tissue. Therefore, the high virus loads detected in plasma probably originated from the lungs. By contrast, disseminated adenovirus infections of immunosuppressed patients, which result also in high virus loads in peripheral blood, are caused by virus replication in multiple internal organs [13]. However, in the immunosuppressed patient, these infections are often associated with other types of adenoviruses than in healthy hosts and may therefore have that other replication rates in the different organs than HAdV-B21 infections.",

Adenoviridae comprise 7 species pathogenic for humans (A\u2013G), and >80 different adenovirus types were classified [[9], [10], [11]]. Transmission occurs by droplets, via the fecal-oral route, and via contaminated fomites. Viral shedding from the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts may continue for weeks, even in asymptomatic patients [9]. The incubation period is 5\u201310 days [10]. In immunocompetent patients, the disease is typically self-limiting [10,11], but persistent infections can be noted in the immune-incompetent host resulting in reactivation and severe disease in case of secondary immunosuppression [20].",

HAdV-B21 can cause severe (broncho-) pneumonia and ARDS [9,11,19,23,24] and the latter may be associated with the emergence of the new subtype 21a, which was also found in our two cases. Main genetic features of this subtype were a shorter penton \u201cRGD\u201d (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid) loop, which binds to the secondary cellular receptor, and thus might influence tropism and virulence. Moreover, subtype 21a was found to have a recombinant genome with the E4 gene region sequence derived from adenovirus type 3, a frequently observed respiratory pathogen [11].",

The high virulence of the currently circulating HAdV-B21 may contribute to rapid disease progression. Lack of awareness of treating ICU physicians for the severity of adenoviral lower respiratory tract infection may result in delayed treatment. However, if early treatment of viral ARDS and particularly of HAdV-B21 related disease would make a difference in terms of outcome, remains unclear. The effectiveness of antiviral treatment in patients with viral ARDS, the choice of drug, its dosage and treatment duration, remain an area of debate and research, even in case of the more prevalent influenza virus infections [[26], [27], [28]]. In 2014, a meta-analysis of 29,234 patients by Muthuri and co-authors found a significant reduction of mortality in adult patients with influenza A treated early with neuraminidase inhibitors [29]. The effect on mortality was lower when treatment was delayed and not significant in children [29]. Two recently published studies do not support high-dose treatment with oseltamivir [26,27]. On the other hand, a Cochrane review on prevention and treatment of influenza with neuraminidase inhibitors found no effect on serious influenza complications such as ARDS [30]. There is little evidence to guide treatment of adenovirus-related ARDS. No prospective randomized clinical trials have been performed to date to support the use of any antiviral agent for adenovirus infection [31,32]. Cidofovir and brincidofovir appear to be effective treatments for severe adenovirus infections and are frequently used in immunocompromised patients [[31], [32], [33]], but none of these substances is approved for this indication [34]. Therefore, further research is certainly warranted.",
