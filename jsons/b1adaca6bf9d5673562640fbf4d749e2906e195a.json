We have analyzed the growth behavior of the top 25 most affected countries by means of a local slope analysis and found three distinct patterns that individual countries follow depending on the strictness of the lockdown protocols: exponential rise and fall, power law, or logistic. For countries showing power law growth we have determined the scaling exponents. For countries that showed a strong slowdown in the rate of infections we have extrapolated the expected saturation of the number of infections and the expected final date. Two different extrapolation methods (logistic and parabolic) were used. Both methods agree on the order of magnitude of saturation and end dates. Global infections rates are analyzed with the same methods. The relevance and accuracy of these extrapolations is discussed.",

Data analysis for the China data [20, 21] and for the top 25 affected countries [22] as well as additional studies for particular countries [23, 24] have clearly shown, however, that by the introduction of lockdown measures and social distancing the growth phase is not exponential any more but follows a power law. The scaling exponents are country-specific and depend on the strictness of governmental interventions and the actual adherence of the people. The power law growth is connected with the actual societal structure that has been shown to exhibit small world or scale-free [25, 26] behavior. The spread of disease is determined by the number of human interactions and therefore limiting those will control the rate at which an infection can spread. After a short initial exponential growth period the institution of a lockdown reduces the possible spreading avenues: the number of infections as well as the number of recovered and deceased patients follows a power law N (t) = Bt \u03b3 until a slow down of the rate of infection in noticeable due to a lack of susceptible hosts.",

            "text": "The reason why a power law growth is observed is as follows: Assuming a densely populated area like a major city or town each individual will during the course of a day have many different interactions with other people. Some of them will be with close relations, i.e. people that are important for the individual such as spouse, children, family, friends, or coworkers. Others, however will be random contacts when sharing the same space for example in public transport, shops, entertainment facilities etc. For the spreading of a disease the importance of the contact, whether or not it is close or random, is not relevant. The important thing, from the point of view of a virus, is close physical proximity. This might be given at the dinner table, in the office, riding a bus or train, or walking in the public park. In fact, on an average day the number of random contacts that satisfy the transmission criterion might well be much larger than the contacts an individual has with his close relations. Random contacts however are the central ingredient for an exponential growth. By instituting lockdown measures, social distancing and telling people to stay at home it is essentially possible -if properly followed -to eliminate all random contacts leaving only the close relations of family and work. It has been observed that the networks spanned by those relationships follow a power law behavior [25, 26] . Since the virus has now only this network as means of spreading it follows that the number of infections will also show a power law dependence. In reality it is, of course, not possible to eliminate all random contacts (for example interactions in grocery shops), but so far the data shows that the stricter the lockdown measures are and the more people adhere to it the closer to a power low the rate of infections behaves.",

For countries that exhibit a clear slowdown in the rate at which the infections spreads we have extrapolated a tentative final number of infections by two different extrapolations methods: logistic and parabolic. While it has been shown that only few countries such as Austria and Switzerland actually follow a logistic growth behavior the extrapolation with the logistic curve was still justified for other countries since the fit closer to the saturation seems to become increasingly better [9] [10] [11] [12] . We have used these extrapolation methods purely on numerical grounds and do not ascribe them the ability to actually explain the physical and biological reasons why the spread would saturate exactly at those given points.

            "text": "Why then are the extrapolations so wrong? Firstly the calculations of the saturations are based on the fitting of some nonlinear function that determines its parameters based on the previous data points. As we have shown however there is hardly any evidence that for example the logistic model in eq. (1) describes the actual progression of the pandemic (with a few notable exceptions). Secondly, the physical and biological limit of possible infections is not reached by far. Current population infections are in the order of 0.2% of the total population and are expected by the extrapolations to stay below 1% (Table III) . That is far too little to effectively limit the spread by herd immunization or actual lack of susceptible individuals. Thirdly, most models do not take into account lockdown measures and interruption of disease spreading paths as instituted in many countries and therefore predict with the first slow down the beginning of the end of the pandemic. As shown in Fig. 8 for Belgium this is simply not true. Finally, one should not forget that power law growth, while not exponential, is still growth. And it will still take a long time to reach the point where an actual saturation has been achieved. So far, outside mainland China, the only country that has effectively managed to control the spread of the disease is South Korea. But even there the number of infections follows a power law with an extraordinarily low exponent of 0.7 (sub-linear growth) and no further slowdown seems to be in sight. Also it should be noted that even in China the pandemic is not over, it is just managed: every day China registers between 50 and 100 new cases. Reaching the saturation does not mean the end of the pandemic. Leaving those few remaining daily new cases uncontrolled and without strict isolation management, or easing the strict measures too early can lead to a second, perhaps more devastating wave. A cautionary example is Denmark that managed to reduce the initial exponential growth to a power law growth of 1.64 only to grow again exponentially soon thereafter (Fig. 9) .",

As long as the US is the largest contributor the world data is likely to behave in a similar way as the infections reported in the USA. One should, however, not neglect that the numbers of infections given in the world data are much less accurate than those reported by single countries. In particular countries with few medical facilities or the lacking ability to test for infections of the COVID-19 virus are bound to severely under-report the true extent of the pandemic. Therefore it can only be assumed that the actual number of infections is much higher and while the trend for individual countries, particularly in Europe and the USA might point towards a saturation many countries on other continents might not have the means to manage the spread of the disease. Due to the current low percentage of the infections relative to the population this might initiate a second wave of a global pandemic as soon as the strict lockdown measures are relaxed and travels into countries with less accurate reporting are allowed again.",
