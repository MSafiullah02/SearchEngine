Our observations were in line with previous findings that the prevalence of diabetes in patients with severe covid-19 is up to 24%. Patients with diabetes were more likely to develop covid-19, which may be due to the fact that patients with diabetes had low pulmonary function.13 But the mechanisms explaining lung dysfunction in diabetes remain vague. Animal studies suggested that alveolar capillary microangiopathy and interstitial fibrosis were induced by glycosylation of the lung tissue collagen in the diabetes model, and this process was mediated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase and angiotensin II.16 17 Autopsy also identified that patients with diabetes had thickening lung basal lamina,18 which may have an influence on pulmonary diffusion function.",

In addition, inflammatory indicators were more severe in patients with severe covid-19 with diabetes, such as hsCRP, procalcitonin, IL-2 receptor, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF\u03b1. Several potential pathway studies suggested diabetes and obesity may lead to activate differentiation of CD4+ T cells though Th1 cell and Th2 cell,12 19 20 and induce dysfunction of Th17 cells21 and Treg cells which affected the balance of proinflammation and anti-inflammation.22 And immune system imbalance may induce secretion of inflammatory cytokines.

Similar to previous studies, patients with severe covid-19 with diabetes in our study were particularly susceptible to receive mechanical ventilation and intensive care, and had higher mortality than those without diabetes. Meanwhile the median survival duration from hospital admission was significantly shortened in patients with diabetes compared with patients without diabetes. The mechanisms linking diabetes with higher mortality and shorter survival time in patients with diabetes were lung dysfunction and aggravated inflammation, which we discussed in the previous part. Another potential mechanism was that hyperglycemia was a risk factor for mortality.25 Hyperglycemia induced by diabetes was linked to aggressive glycosylation,29 which leads to overproduction of advanced glycation end products. And aberrant glycosylation was considered to be related to dysfunction of immunoglobulins.30 Dysregulation in glycosylation of IgG Fc domains may lead to susceptibility to infectious diseases.31 In addition, dysfunction of IgG may impair clearance function between phagocytic cell antigens (such as bacteria or virus, which may aggravate serious infection). And hyperglycemia may be due to following reasons: (1) Patients with severe covid-19 were unable to take food regularly, and the nutritional support was mainly though intravenous fluid infusion. (2) Covid-19 could cause dysfunction of gastrointestinal absorption. (3) Steroid treatment. (4) Infection itself can cause blood glucose fluctuation. Covid-19 was reported to use ACE2 as a receptor,27 which was expressed in lung, pancreas and other tissues. Covid-19 may bind to ACE2 in pancreas, which can damage pancreatic function and lead to hyperglycemia.",

Third, all authors are first line doctors, who could directly observe participants. There are several limitations of our study. First, the sample size was relatively small. Second, a retrospective method was used in our study. Third, high mortality was observed in our study. It may be explained by the fact that Tongji Hospital is the designated hospital for severe cases. In fact, with the accumulation of treatment experience, the mortality in patients with severe covid-19 dramatically decreases. So the real mortality in patients with severe covid-19 still needs further study on large sample.",
