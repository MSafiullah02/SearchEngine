The use of these agents can increase the risk of opportunistic infections, but not that of serious infections. Therefore, adoption of adequate measures to prevent and protect patients is an essential part of the quality standards of care in IBD.",

Indeed, a systematic review 4 showed that the risk of hospital admission (odds ratio 0\u00b748, 95% CI 0\u00b729-0\u00b780) and surgery (0\u00b767, 0\u00b746-0\u00b797) is significantly reduced by use of biologics for patients with IBD. The probability of relapse after stopping effective immunomodulators or biological therapy is about 50% and is associated with an increased need for steroids, and risk of hospital admission and surgery. 5 Some considerations are needed. First, SARS-CoV-2 infection should be considered as a serious rather than an opportunistic infection, as the risk of infection is not related to concomitant immunosuppression. Second, severe COVID-19 might be associated with cytokine storm and is possibly related to a hyper-immune response in addition to virus-related damage. Third, around 5% of patients who relapse because of withdrawal of effective therapies will require hospital admission against a backdrop of overwhelmed hospital capacity. Thus, the risk and benefits of continuing or stopping biologics should be carefully balanced and should not be assumed to be a general rule for all patients with IBD, especially given the length of time the pandemic is likely to last.",
