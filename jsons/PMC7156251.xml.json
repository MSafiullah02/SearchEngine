He reported having systemic arterial hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. On examination, he had a temperature of 37.7\u00b0C, heart rate of 85 beats/min, respiratory rate of 15 breaths/min, blood pressure of 112/70 mmHg, and 94% oxygen saturation. His lungs were clear to auscultation. A leukogram was normal, and the patient\u2019s C-reactive protein level was 4.78 mg/dL (normal levels below 1.0 mg/dL).",
