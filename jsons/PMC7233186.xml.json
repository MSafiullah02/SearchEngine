            "text": "To the Editor: Some researchers have hypothesized that drugs that interfere with the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system (RAAS), including angiotensin-converting\u2013enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), may increase susceptibility to coronaviruses. This hypothesis is based on the observation that coronaviruses engage ACE2 for cell entry1 and that altered expression of ACE2 is influenced by the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, an action that has been shown in animal models.2 Influenza A (H7N9, H1N1, and H5N1) has been shown to use the ACE2 receptor to mediate lung damage, similar to that seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).3 Understanding the shared mechanism between SARS and influenza may help to address the question as to how ACE inhibitors and ARBs may modulate the manifestations of certain viral respiratory infections.",

Permission for the use of CPRD and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data for the research was provided by the CPRD independent scientific advisory committee. We defined exposure to an ACE inhibitor as a documented prescription during the study period. We performed additional analyses to assess the association between the incidence of influenza and the duration of use of an ACE inhibitor, which was defined as the sum of prescription days (categorized as none, <0.5 years, 0.5 to <1.5 years, 1.5 to <2.5 years, 2.5 to <3.5 years, 3.5 to <5.0 years, 5.0 to <7.5 years, 7.5 to <10.0 years, and \u226510.0 years). The same methods were used to assess the association between the use of ARBs and the incidence of influenza.",

A curvilinear relationship was observed between the number of prescription days and incident influenza. As compared with no prescription days, the hazard ratio for incident influenza was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.91 to 1.07) for a duration of less than 0.5 years, 0.74 (95% CI, 0.65 to 0.85) for a duration of 2.5 to less than 3.5 years, and 0.52 (95% CI, 0.46 to 0.58) for a duration of 5.0 to less than 7.5 years.
