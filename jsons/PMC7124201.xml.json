The total economic burden of influenza epidemics amounted to $87.1 billion/year (Molinari et al., 2007). In recent years, influenza has obtained unprecedented attention due to widespread occurrence of novel influenza viruses, such as the bird flu and H1N1 flu. A major public health concern is the possibility of a pandemic, which could be as severe as the 1918 Spanish flu (Webby & Webster, 2003). This great concern has motivated scientists and health policy makers to model influenza epidemics and predict transmission dynamics (Coburn, Wagner, & Blower, 2009).",

The transmission is often fostered and amplified in cities and urban areas. The dense human contacts in a city form fast and uncontrolled channels for transmission (Meade & Earickson, 2005). In addition, cities can serve as hubs that transmit diseases to small \u201csatellite\u201d towns, resulting in regional or even global pandemics (Grenfell, Bjornstad, & Kappey, 2001). Although the importance of cities is widely recognized, little research has been devoted to modeling and understanding the city-wide influenza transmission. A possible challenge is to represent and analyze much detailed information at such a small scale. In recent literature, there has been seen a few efforts to model city-scale disease epidemics, such as the EpiSims model by Eubank et al. (2004), and the BioWar model by Carley et al. (2006). These studies have been focused on modeling issues at the city scale, but little attention has been paid to the spatial\u2013temporal transmission of influenza, possible factors contributing to transmission, and resultant urban health risks.",

An individual-based spatially explicit model is established to represent an urban contact network. Based on such network, infection sources are introduced with different patterns and corresponding influenza epidemics are simulated. The transmission of influenza over time and space is analyzed, and potential places and times of high risk are identified. The remainder of this article is organized into the following sections. The second section introduces the individual-based modeling approach used in this study. The third section describes the urbanized area of Buffalo and the simulation model for influenza transmission. The two sections that follow present and discuss the simulation results, respectively. The last section concludes the article and discusses its implications.",

            "text": "During the past decade, the individual-based approach began to gain momentum in modeling a variety of infectious diseases, such as influenza, smallpox, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), foot and mouth disease (FMD), and others (Eubank et al., 2004, Huang et al., 2004, Keeling et al., 2001, Longini et al., 2005). These individual-based models use a bottom-up approach, which starts with discrete individuals of a population, and tries to understand how the population\u2019s properties emerge from interactions among individuals (Grimm & Railsback, 2005). This approach offers three advantages for modeling disease transmission. First, the heterogeneity of both individuals and their interactions can be explicitly represented, as can the subsequent heterogeneity in disease transmission (Keeling, 1999, Koopman and Lynch, 1999). Second, the randomness of disease infection between a pair of individuals can be captured as a stochastic process. Third, by aggregating individual infections, the outcome of disease transmission can be studied at multiple scales, such as the community, city, national and international scales. These three advantages bring the epidemic modeling closer to reality than other traditional models. However, the increased realism demands more assumptions to be made and more parameters to be estimated, bringing more complexity in modeling (Judson, 1994, Koopman, 2002).",

Nodes can have attributes, such as a finite number of links and an infection status.

In these macro-scale models, the fundamental geographic unit is a community, which can be either a census tract or a pre-defined square area. Individuals are assigned to different communities to satisfy a set of real demographic distributions, such as the distributions of age, gender, and household size. Nationwide workplace data and traveling statistics are utilized to simulate individual travel behavior within and between communities, often following a distance-decay law. These models successfully replicate wave-like and hierarchical diffusion patterns that occur in geographically extensive areas. However, by covering such larger geographic areas, these models often simplify or neglect the detailed information within a city, such as the specific locations of households and workplaces, the urban transportation network, and the daily activities of individuals. These models, therefore, may be less useful for planning influenza control in individual cities.",

Downtown Buffalo is enclosed by Interstate Highway 190, and State Routes 33 and 198, while Downtown Niagara Falls is surrounded by State Route 61 and Robert Moses Parkway. The CBD is characterized by its significantly higher densities of residents, households, and businesses than the other two zones (Table 1\n).

With an area of 144.6 km2, this zone has the second highest densities of residents, households, and businesses. The rest of the urbanized area is the suburbs, which covers a large area of 10,538.1 km2.

The three time periods include the daytime (e.g., 9 am\u20136 pm), pastime (e.g., 6 pm\u201312 am), and nighttime (e.g., 12 am\u20139 am), while the four types of locations include homes, workplaces, service places, and neighbor households. Under this spatial\u2013temporal frame, individuals may have two types of contacts: close contacts and occasional contacts. Close contacts happen at homes, workplaces, and neighbor households, where an individual has contact with all the other individuals in the same location.

A worker is randomly assigned to a workplace that satisfies two criteria (Bian et al., 2008). First, the employer type of the workplace from the business databases should match the employer type of the worker from the census data. Second, the shortest distance between the home and workplace in the real road system should match the trip distance to work estimated from the census data (trip duration to work \u00d7 speed of a trip mode). Unlike ordinary workers, school-aged individuals in each household are assigned to a nearest school as their workplace.

The third is the attributes for individuals and households created for the nighttime and daytime populations. Using the frequency statistics in travel survey as constraints, the total number of trips for a household is first determined. The trips of a household are then allocated to workers in the household and then other members of the household. Each trip is assigned, according to frequency statistics, with a trip mode, a trip duration, one of three types of service trips (workplace-to-service, home-to-service, and service-to-service), and one of five types of services (Table 2\n). Given a type of service trip and a type of service, the model assigns an individual to a service place or a neighbor household that matches the trip distance (speed of trip mode \u00d7 trip duration) (Bian et al., 2008). In this manner, a set of attributes regarding pastime activities of individuals can be generated, as shown in Fig. 3.

At some point in time, a susceptible individual comes into the latent status after receiving influenza virus. The receipt of infection starts a 2-day latent period, during which influenza develops internally and cannot be transmitted. At the end of the latent period, the individual becomes infectious and can transmit influenza to other susceptible individuals. The length of infectious period varies from 4 to 7 days depending on the age or health status of the individual (Heymann, 2004).

To initialize the epidemic, five infectious individuals, as infection sources, are seeded into the study area on the first day of the simulation. For a comprehensive analysis, four seeding scenarios are devised based on the aforementioned three-in-one urban structure. Specifically, the five infection sources are randomly distributed: (1) in the entire study area, (2) only in the CBD (e.g., at bus terminals), (3) only in the transition zone (e.g., at local medical centers), and (4) only in the suburbs (e.g., at airports).

The peak time and the number of new cases at the peak time are two major characteristics of the curve. To reduce the randomness, the epidemic curve and two associated characteristics are estimated by averaging 50 model realizations. To display the spatial spread of influenza, infection intensity maps are created by the following three steps. First, every infection event occurring in a given time interval is plotted as a point at the location of infection, such as the home, workplace, service place, or neighbor household. Second, the study area is divided into a cell grid for subsequent estimation. The reason for rasterization is because plotting tens of thousands of points produces unclear spatial patterns, while rasterization helps provide a clear and reasonable representation. Third, a kernel density function is used to estimate the magnitude of new infections occurring within every cell during a time interval, i.e., the infection intensity at a cell location. A high-intensity value indicates that the corresponding cell location is undergoing a rapid growth in the number of infections.",

First, R\n0 is the number of individuals in a susceptible population that are directly infected by the introduction of a single infectious individual (Diekmann, Heesterbeek, & Metz, 1990). Recent studies on observed data have reported that the R\n0 of influenza ranges from 0.9 to 2.1 with a mean of 1.3 (Chowell et al., 2007, Ferguson et al., 2005, Mills et al., 2004). In this study, R\n0 is estimated by tracing the number of infections directly caused by the infection sources. Second, the overall attack rate is the proportion of total population that is infected during an epidemic. The observed overall attack rate for influenza epidemics ranges from 10% to 20% of the population (CDC, 2008, Cox and Subbarao, 2000). Third, the proportion of infections at households (including homes and neighbor households), workplaces, and service places are estimated to be in the ranges of 47\u201351%, 37\u201342%, 11\u201312%, respectively (Longini and Halloran, 2005, Yang et al., 2008). To match the three indices to established literature (Table 3\n), the infection rates Iage for children, adults, and seniors are calibrated to 0.1, 0.08, and 0.09, respectively.

As shown in Fig. 6\n, the time course of the epidemic is well predicted by the model, although the magnitude of simulated cases is much larger than the laboratory data. The first possible reason is that a large number of infected individuals (more than 80%) may choose self-care and are reluctant to seek health care (McIsaac et al., 1998, Stoller et al., 1993). These infected individuals cannot be identified and reported. Second, for those who seek health care, only a small portion of their specimens are submitted for laboratory testing. Therefore, the number of influenza cases is always highly under-reported, and a complete data is rather difficult to collect. The laboratory data, so far, may be the best available touchstone for model validation. In this sense, our model performs well in predicting the trend, and at least allows the estimate of a worse case result.",

In addition, there are a few low-intensity areas distant from the seeding locations, most likely to occur within the downtown Buffalo, the downtown Niagara Falls, the University of Buffalo, and the Niagara University. After Day 40, as the number of new infections increases exponentially, the spatial spread of influenza tends to be similar for all four seeding scenarios. For this reason, Fig. 9 only displays the spatial spread of influenza under the random seeding scenario, while the other three scenarios are reported in the supplementary document.

This is because the number of influenza cases increases slowly before Day 40, and the response time is relatively sufficient. The epidemic can potentially be avoided by applying voluntary control strategies, such as mass vaccination programs, and campaigns that promote preventive behaviors. If the early control cannot be achieved, the number of cases would increase dramatically. Under this circumstance, mandatory control strategies, such as case isolation, contact tracing, and household quarantine, should be implemented to mitigate the impacts of the epidemic. The weekly variation in the epidemic curves also suggests a possible control strategy that extends the weekend period by 1 or 2 days. Because most workplaces and schools are closed simultaneously during the weekends, fewer close contacts may occur than those in weekdays, resulting in fewer infections. The effectiveness of this weekend extension strategy is worthy of investigation.",

Next, the new infections rapidly spread over the entire study area (expansion), probably because of the frequent travel of individuals between the CBD, transition zone, and suburbs. Subsequently, most locations in the study area experience a rapid and heterogeneous growth in infections (fast city-wide growth). As time proceeds, the growth of infections remains widespread but starts to slow down (slow city-wide growth).

Days 41\u201360 and Days 61\u201380 are two high-risk time periods corresponding to the stages of expansion and fast city-wide growth, respectively. On the other hand, high-risk places can be identified as areas with extremely high intensity of infection. The downtown areas of both cities are at high risk because they have the highest densities of residents and businesses. Similarly, the town center of Kenmore is also suggested to be a high-risk place because of its intensive land use for residences, commerce and industry. The university campuses are large groups of individuals with dense within-group contacts, and they thus are at high risk. Likewise, the industrial park in southern Buffalo is another high-risk place, because it is a cluster of large-scale chemical factories with a large number of workers. Once influenza is identified in the study area, these high-risk places should be monitored under close surveillance and be targeted by control efforts with priority.",

One of the two major factors is the spatial heterogeneity in the city, in terms of the population distribution and land use patterns (households and businesses). This factor directly influences the spatial layout of disease transmission. Areas with dense population or intensive land use patterns always end up with a high intensity of infection, while sparsely populated areas have relatively low intensity. The other major factor is the travel of individuals in the city, which has a profound effect on the temporal sequence of transmission. Without frequent travel of individuals between the CBD, transition zone, and suburbs, the infection can only expand locally around the infection sources. The city-wide travel of individuals quickly transports influenza viruses to everywhere else, leading to the rapid expansion of affected areas.",

Regardless of where the infection sources are seeded, both the spatial layout and the temporal sequence of influenza transmission are similar, except for the early stage. It is intuitive that the spatial layout of transmission is similar under different seeding scenarios, because it is primarily determined by the inherent population distribution and land use patterns. Surprisingly, the temporal sequence of transmission also remains similar, and is insensitive to where infection sources are seeded. A possible reason is that individuals commute frequently between the three zones of the city, and can easily reach everywhere in the study area. Once the infection sources infect a sufficient number of surrounding individuals, the influenza viruses can be transported to places of high risks, from where similar spatial\u2013temporal patterns of infection start to occur. This finding implies that wherever the initial infections are found, the control plan does not need a major change, and the control efforts may be only applied at fixed times and places. Further investigations of this finding are warranted.",

In reality, these individuals may be influenced by their contacts, and spontaneously take preventive behaviors to protect themselves. Second, the simulation of population involves the disaggregation of census data, and assumes independence between a few of demographic variables. This independence assumption helps reduce the modeling complexity, but may also introduce biases in simulation. Existing individual data, such as Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), could be used to improve the simulation. Finally, this study assumes that immunity is obtained through early vaccination before the epidemic or through infection during the epidemic. It is also possible that individuals can gain immunity from previous epidemics, and therefore the immunity rate may be under-estimated. Although compensation for these limitations may improve the results, it also greatly increases the complexity of the model. It has been argued that the goal of modeling is not to predict exactly what may happen during an epidemic, but rather to observe how the epidemic may proceed and encourage appropriate questions. In this sense, the model results provide valuable knowledge regarding city-wide influenza transmission.",

An individual-based spatially explicit model has been developed to simulate influenza transmission through an urban contact network. The simulation results indicate a complex pattern of influenza transmission in a five-stage process. The complexity is attributable to three factors: the spatial heterogeneity in the population, the frequent city-wide travel of individuals, and the distribution of infection sources. The first factor primarily contributes to the spatial layout of disease transmission, while the second has a profound effect on the temporal sequence of transmission. The third factor, the infection\u2013source distribution, only affects spatial\u2013temporal transmission at the early stage, but its effect is largely weakened later by the city-wide travel of individuals. Therefore, the high risks of infection occur not only at the same locations, but also at almost the same times, regardless of where the infection sources are introduced. A number of studies may have reported the spatial similarity in high-risk places, but the temporal similarity has not been revealed before this study.",
