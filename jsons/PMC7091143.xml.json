Several studies tried to investigate the role of HBoV, reporting a detection rate ranging from 3.1% [1] to 23.1% [2] in children with acute respiratory tract infections. Sometimes, HBoV was considered responsible for a severe clinical presentation in children with acute respiratory disease [3]; however, other studies reported no differences between HBoV and other viruses in the clinical course of respiratory infections [4].",

In addition, nowadays, the virus does not fulfill the criteria for etiologic association of virus with prevalent disease [8]. As a result, its role of a respiratory pathogen has not been completely accepted yet [9]. To increase our knowledge on the clinical spectrum of HBoV in children with respiratory disease, we aimed to describe the clinical and serological characteristics of children hospitalized for acute respiratory tract infection, whose nasal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) tested HBoV positive and to investigate whether there is a difference between single infection and co-infection of HBoV.",

[18] and only a bit lower than other studies [5, 7, 19]. In infants hospitalized for an acute respiratory infection, Calvo et al. in one study detected HBoV in combination with other viruses in 64.6% of children and in another study in 75% of the patients [5, 19]. Ghietto et al. confirmed a high rate of HBoV co-detection (78.1%) [7], as well as de Leon et al. (95%) [4] and Martin et al. (72%) [3]. The high rate of co-detection raises doubts on causal relationship of HBoV with respiratory infection, considering its prolonged persistence in the airways likewise. Several authors found the virus in different type of cells [20] and in respiratory samples of healthy volunteers [21]. In addition, we found 3% of HBoV detection among 21 controls without respiratory symptoms in our previous study [16]. The cause\u2013effect relationship seems hard to be approved, but a possible help can rely on HBoV detection from the airways samples during the acute infection together with seroconversion of the anti-HBoV antibody titers [22].",

Viral trigger in preschool wheeze is nowadays universally recognized, both for episodic and multiple trigger of wheezing [23]. Association of HBoV in respiratory samples and wheezing has been largely described in children [4\u20136, 17]. Calvo et al. found [19] infections caused by HBoV were clinically similar to those by RV, except for a higher necessity of oxygen support in the cases of HBoV. In our series, two out of the 19 infants (10.5%) hospitalized for wheezing had a severe clinical presentation and required admission to the PICU. HBoV was detected alone in severe cases and in all cases of pneumonia, suggesting that HBoV might play the role of a pathogen in patient with severe lower respiratory tract infection.",
