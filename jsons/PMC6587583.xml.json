Diagnosis of RVI is often limited by the need to get a clinician-collected respiratory sample. However, it may be difficult for ill patients to go to a healthcare facility, and if they do, time to diagnosis may be delayed [1] and they may expose other patients or staff to infection. Identification of sensitive methods for self-collection would address these issues, as well as provide options for community-based assessments of RVI epidemiology and longitudinal monitoring.",

We also determined that the Ct values in NS were significantly lower, indicating higher viral concentrations. Specific symptoms (nasal congestion, sore throat, etc.) were not associated with increased likelihood of detection by one method versus the other, although nasal symptoms and sneezing were more common in those with RV detected versus not. There were limitations to this study. There were only small numbers of episodes for several specific viruses, making it difficult to generalize results to all viruses. In a study of H5N1, De Jong, et al reported that provider-collected pharyngeal specimens were positive more frequently, and had higher viral loads, than nasal swabs [16]. We only had 7, non-typed, influenza cases, and so could not assess this finding. Second, while prior data shows our self-collected NS are equivalent to provider-collected samples, we have not evaluated this for throat swabs. However, this study focuses on the real-world application of self-collected samples, and our findings provide insight regarding viral load and detection in two separate respiratory sites. Third, we used different swabs for nasal (polyurethane foam) and throat (nylon flocked). The nasal swabs were chosen based on increased comfort and patient acceptability and our prior studies demonstrating comparability to provider-collected nasal washes [8], and flocked throat swabs were the standard at the time; however, different swab types may yield different results.",
