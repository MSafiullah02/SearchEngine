            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV). SARS has been recognized as a global threat since the initial outbreak of SARS first identified in Guangdong Province, China in November 2002. This outbreak spread to several countries and has had significant health and economic impact. SARS is a life-threatening form of atypical pneumonia characterized by high fever, malaise rigor, headache, chills, cough, and progressive radiographic changes of the chest and lymphophenia.1, 2, 3 The mortality rate is nearly 10%.4 The SARS-CoV is a positive-strand RNA virus that uses a complex set of enzymes to replicate the largest RNA genomes currently known for RNA viruses and synthesize an extensive set of 5\u2032 leader-containing subgenomic mRNAs that encode the viral structural proteins and several species-specific proteins with unknown functions. These processes are mediated primarily by the 3C-like protease (3CLpro) with chymotrypsin fold. The active site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro contains Cys145 and His41 to constitute a catalytic dyad, in which cysteine functions as the common nucleophile in the proteolytic process.5, 6 Because of the essential role in viral processing, the 3CLpro is considered as an attractive target for anti-SARS and other coronavirus infections. 3CLpro is named after the 3C proteases (3Cpro) from picornaviruses such as enterovirus (EV), coxsackievirus (CV), and rhinovirus (RV) which cause life-threatening infectious diseases. The 3Cpro essential for viral replication had served as a drug target.7 Both 3Cpro and 3CLpro have similar 3-D structures, but unlike the dimeric 3CLpro, 3Cpro is monomeric and utilizes Glu-His-Cys triad for catalysis.8\n",

Therefore, it is still a great challenge to explore new chemical classes of SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors that can be used in anti-SARS therapy in case the disease re-emerges.",

C-3 phenyl ring fits into the S2 pocket, having hydrophobic interactions with Met-49, Arg-188, and Gln-189 (hiding behind these resides in Fig. 2A). The carboxyl benzylidene group is situated in the S3 pocket of the 3CLpro. The oxygen of the carboxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Gln-192 at a distance of 3.2 \u00c5. It is important for inhibition activity since the compounds lacking carboxy functionality in the benzylidene lost the activity. Electron withdrawing R1 substituents like cyano (2p), fluoro (2t), and nitro (2u), accompanied with R2 carboxyl group favors the inhibitory activity.",

According to the modeling shown in Figure 2B, the R1 nitro group of 2u forms H-bond with Gly-145 (2p and 2t without nitro group fail to form such a H-bond) and benzylidene carboxylate of 2u is H-bonded to Glu-71 in the active site of 3Cpro. It was predicted that the C-3 phenyl ring of 2u is pointed to S1 site and the carboxyl benzylidene group is relocated to S2 in order to form the H-bond in 3Cpro due to the subtle differences between the structures of 3CLpro and 3Cpro.7 However, it should be noted that computer modeling is speculation based on energy minimization to fit the SAR data. In conclusion, 2p and 2t are selective against 3CLpro, but 2u is a common inhibitor of 3CLpro and 3Cpro, which may be potentially developed into anti-coronaviral and anti-picornaviral drugs.",
