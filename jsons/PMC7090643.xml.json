            "text": "Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV, here RSV) was first isolated from chimpanzees in 1956 [1] and was subsequently recovered from infants with severe lower respiratory tract disease [2]. It is a non-segmented negative-sense single-stranded enveloped RNA virus that belongs to the family of Paramyxoviridae, genus Pneumovirus, subfamily Pneumovirinae. Its 10 genes encode 11 proteins since two overlapping open reading frames in the M2 mRNA yield two distinct matrix proteins, M2-1 and M2-2. The viral envelope contains three proteins, the G glycoprotein, the fusion (F) glycoprotein, and the small hydrophobic (SH) protein. The G protein functions in host cell attachment and the F protein is responsible for fusion and cell entry, whereas the SH protein is not required in either of these processes. The RSV virus comprises five other structural proteins, the large (L) protein, nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), and M2-1, and two non-structural proteins (NS1 and NS2). Whether M2-2 also is a component of the mature assembled virus particles is currently unknown (Fig. 1).\n",

            "text": "There is a single RSV serotype with two major antigenic subgroups, A and B. Strains of both subtypes often co-circulate, but generally one of the subtypes predominates [3, 4]. The results of molecular analyses show that several genotypes are present simultaneously in any given season and region, but even in neighboring regions, the circulating strains may differ [5, 6]. In temperate regions, RSV infections show a distinct seasonality with onset in late fall or early winter, a peak between mid-December and early February, and season offset in late spring (Fig. 2). Some areas, in particular in northern Europe, report yearly alternations between an early large outbreak and a late small outbreak. In tropical regions, the patterns are less predictable and can include two yearly peaks in spring and fall or fairly constant infection rates throughout the year. Humans are the only host for RSV, and the reasons for the near disappearance of RSV between epidemics remain unclear. Following each epidemic, mean titers of maternally derived RSV neutralizing antibodies were found to decline in consecutively hospitalized infants <6 months of age and to reach their nadir shortly before the peak of the following epidemic in Denmark [7]. This led to the hypothesis that a cyclic pattern in the level of protective RSV-specific antibodies makes a major contribution to the seasonal pattern of RSV infections in temperate climates. It is more difficult to envision how this could account for the occurrence of two yearly RSV epidemics, as has been reported from Taiwan [8].\n",

            "text": "It is generally believed that most children will have experienced at least one RSV infection by the age of 2 years. This is largely based on results from the Houston Family Study, in which a birth cohort of 125 infants was followed prospectively during the period 1975\u20131980 [9]. During their first year of life, 68 % of the infants experienced a RSV infection; by the end of the second year, almost all children had been infected with RSV at least once. However, active surveillance during a RSV epidemic revealed an attack rate of 29 % in infants from Rochester, NY, though 62 % of infants within infected families [10], which is similar to the 32 % infection rate during the first year of life reported from a prospective study in the UK [11]. These rates also agree with the results of seroprevalence studies from Germany and Japan [12, 13], even when taking into account that infants may not elaborate lasting antibody responses during primary infection [14]. In contrast, seroprevalence data from China support high rates of RSV infection during the first year of life [15]. An important determinant of the infection rate appears to be the severity of the RSV epidemic, which varies from 1 year to the next, and of course the extent of individual exposure [14, 16]. In a daycare setting, essentially all children experiencing their first exposure to RSV during a major epidemic were infected, whereas the rate was only 40 % in years without a major epidemic [14].",

The clinical manifestations range from mild upper respiratory tract illness (URTI) or otitis media to severe and potentially life-threatening lower respiratory tract involvement (LRTI). The most common form of LRTI in RSV-infected infants is bronchiolitis, but pneumonia and croup are also seen. Involvement of the lower airways occurs in \u223c15\u201350 % of infants and young children with primary RSV infection and necessitates hospitalization in 1\u20133 % of the annual birth cohort, with infants between 2 and 6 months of age being at the highest risk [9\u201311, 14, 18, 19]. However, in some regions, the highest incidence of LRTI is reported in infants aged 6\u201311 months or even children between 1 and 2 years of age [20, 21]. In \u223c5\u201310 % of hospitalized infants, the disease is severe enough to require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Deaths are rare in previously healthy infants born in industrialized countries, but mortality rates are significantly higher in infants and children in developing countries and in patients with preexisting cardiac or lung disease or other chronic conditions [8, 21, 22].",

Even in secondary infections, the disease is usually symptomatic in young children, but its severity steadily diminishes with subsequent exposures, with fewer children experiencing bronchiolitis or other lower respiratory illness, fever, and middle-ear effusions [14]. Reinfections remain common throughout life, but in older children and adults, symptoms are generally either absent or confined to the upper respiratory tract, with LRTI (tracheobronchitis, bronchitis, wheezing) being observed in approximately one fourth of symptomatic illnesses [23]. However, immunocompromised patients, those with chronic cardiopulmonary disease, and the frail and elderly are also at risk of severe lower respiratory tract involvement, and RSV constitutes a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in these populations [24\u201326].",

The term is most often used to refer to an acute viral LRTI in infants or children <24 months of age characterized by rhinorrhea followed by dry, wheezy cough, tachypnea, dyspnea, and often subcostal, intercostal, and supraclavicular retractions [27]. Fever may be present, but high fever is uncommon. Apnea may be observed in very young and premature infants. These clinical signs are accompanied by wheeze and/or fine inspiratory crackles on auscultation. While North America and some parts of Europe place major emphasis on the presence of wheezing, widespread crepitations are considered to be the hallmark of bronchiolitis in the UK, Australia and other parts of Europe (while wheezing alone would be diagnosed as viral-induced wheeze). Some clinicians recommend limiting the diagnosis of bronchiolitis to the first episode of wheezing [28].",

A chest X-ray may show hyperinflation and patchy atelectasis. Although X-ray findings may be helpful in differentiating bronchiolitis from pneumonia, X-rays are not uniformly necessary, but should be confined to cases of diagnostic uncertainty [27]. Note that many epidemiological studies, particularly from developing countries, now follow the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation to refer to any RSV LRTI as pneumonia, since bronchiolitis and pneumonia are difficult to distinguish clinically or radiographically. In cases of diagnostic uncertainty, bacteriological testing may also be helpful, but its routine use is not indicated since the risk of serious bacterial infections is low in infants with bronchiolitis, even if they are febrile [29\u201333]. The likelihood of bacterial infection becomes higher in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) [34, 35]. Pulse oximetry is recommended for all patients presenting at the emergency department, although experts disagree on whether supplemental oxygen should be instituted at oxygen saturation of \u226492 or <90 %. While some recommend routine use of rapid antigen testing for RSV for guiding cohort arrangements, the guidelines proposed by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) do not recommend routine virological testing since its results rarely alter management decisions, but consider it useful when cohorting is desired [27].",

Although this does not greatly enhance the detection frequency of RSV unless it is combined with hybridization [36], it is the only method for the detection of some newly identified viruses, e.g., human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and bocaviruses, and has greatly improved the detection rate of rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, and adenovirus (AdV) [36\u201339]. There is, however, continued debate over the interpretation of positive RT-PCR results since a substantial portion of samples obtained from asymptomatic subjects without evidence of recent respiratory infections are positive by RT-PCR [17, 40, 41].",

Significantly higher frequencies were obtained for infants <6 months old (44.5/1,000 live births) compared to infants aged 6\u201311 months (24.2/1,000) [44]. Another analysis yielded rates of 48.9 for infants 0\u20132 months of age, 28.4 for infants aged 3\u20135 months, and 13.4 for 6\u201311 month-old infants for the period 1997\u20132006 [46]. Of particular note, American Indian and Alaska Native infants are hospitalized due to RSV infection much more often than the general US infant population, and the highest frequencies were observed in Native infants living in Alaska and the Southwest, with rates of 70.9 and 48.2 per 1,000 for RSV hospitalizations, respectively [44]. Broken down by type of disease, the rates for RSV bronchiolitis and pneumonia hospitalizations were 24.2 and 3.0 per 1,000 births, respectively [44]. The corresponding figures for bronchiolitis in American Indian and Alaska Native infants were 54.54 and 43.4 per 1,000, respectively. At least for Alaska Native infants, this appears to represent a marked underestimate of average annual hospitalization rates, since the above data were for the period 2000\u20132001, during which the RSV hospitalization rates in the Yukon Delta were found to be the lowest observed between 1994 and 2004 [47]. The overall frequency for 1994\u20131997 was 178/1,000, which declined to 104/1,000 for 2001\u20132004, largely due to a reduction in RSV hospitalizations in premature high-risk infants after the introduction of palivizumab prophylaxis.

More specifically, a virus is detected by (RT)-PCR in \u223c75\u201395 % of infants \u22642 years of age who are hospitalized with bronchiolitis, and RSV accounts for \u223c70\u201375 % of the virus-positive samples [39, 54\u201358] (see also Table 2). Interestingly, the proportion of RSV does not vary markedly regardless of whether sampling is performed for several years [57], a single whole year [54], or one or more RSV seasons only [39, 55, 56]. This clearly illustrates that RSV is the most frequent cause of hospitalizations for bronchiolitis, but it also underscores that other viruses can cause bronchiolitis, including rhinovirus, hMPV, corona, parainfluenza and influenza viruses, bocavirus and AdV [39, 53, 54, 56, 57, 59]. The proportion with a discharge diagnosis of bronchiolitis is similar in patients with RSV, hMPV or rhinovirus infections [52, 60]. However, the overall hospitalization rates for these viruses generally are significantly lower compared to RSV-associated disease in infants <1 year of age, although some data suggest that picornaviruses, including rhinovirus, are the most common etiological agent in acute respiratory illness requiring hospitalization even in this population [61].\n",

Two of these cohorts consisted of children at high risk of atopy, and atopy has been shown to predispose to rhinovirus-associated wheezy respiratory tract disease [63, 64]. Consequently, these cohorts may not be fully representative of the general population. However, in unselected cohorts, picornaviruses (which include rhinovirus) also were identified as the most frequent cause of acute respiratory episodes, including LRTI [62].",

A further risk factor for RSV hospitalizations is low birth weight [71, 74], particularly birth weight <10th percentile [76]. Infants with congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies are also at risk of severe disease [69, 77]. In addition, trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), other chromosomal abnormalities, malformations, interstitial lung disease, neuromuscular disease, liver disease, and inborn errors of metabolism have been associated with a \u223ctwofold increased risk of hospitalization overall, with individual incidence rate ratios ranging from \u223c1.5 for encephalocele to 4.3 for cystic fibrosis [69, 70].

As already mentioned, Alaska Native and American Indian infants are hospitalized due to RSV infection much more frequently than the general US infant population [44, 47]. However, in a Tennessee Medicaid cohort, European ancestry was an independent risk factor for hospitalization due to RSV infection [65]. Others also found that non-Hispanic patients of European extraction were more likely to be treated as inpatients than as outpatients, to have private health insurance and to be younger than 6 months of age [42]. Only younger age and prematurity were identified as independent risk factors in this investigation. Among hospitalized patients, African ancestry was protective, with black infants showing higher oxygen saturation and a shorter duration of hospitalization [79].",

There are even studies that are unable to detect a significant association of disease severity or hospitalization with any of these factors [88]. This suggests that other host factors play a primary role in such cohorts. These include the host immune response to RSV infection and the genetic susceptibility of the host, possibly including an atopic predisposition. These aspects will be discussed in greater length in later sections.",

The method used for viral quantification does not account for these differences since both quantitative RT-PCR and plaque assays have yielded positive as well as negative results. In ambulatory subjects with a first episode of RSV infection, there was no significant difference in viral load between patients with bronchiolitis and those experiencing only URTI [11]. In contrast, the results from another prospectively followed birth cohort indicate a moderate correlation between viral load and disease severity in patients infected with RSV alone, but not in those co-infected with another respiratory virus [103]. However, the authors point out that the viral loads in these outpatient episodes were similar to those they had previously found in infants hospitalized with severe RSV LRTI, indicating that viral load is not the only factor determining disease severity. In a community-based surveillance study from Indonesia, viral load was associated with disease severity in children \u22651 year of age, but not in infants, even though children <1 year of age had higher viral loads and generally had more severe disease than older children [104].",

            "text": "Several investigations showed RSV subtype A to be associated with more severe disease compared to subtype B, and this risk persisted after adjusting for age, prematurity, and other risk factors [3, 4, 75, 105]. Conversely, a greater severity in subtype B compared with subtype A infections has only been reported in one study [106]. To add to the confusion, other studies were unable to detect a significant association at all [98, 107, 108]. Clade or genotype may be a more important determinant of disease severity than subtype [5, 106, 109\u2013111], although a significant association with genotype is not consistently seen either [112]. These discrepancies are likely due to the fact that several different strains generally co-circulate in any given RSV season [5, 6], and some of the studies may simply lack the statistical power to detect significant differences in disease severity between individual RSV genotypes. The results from a recent in vitro study in primary epithelial cells (ECs) and an epithelial cell lines suggest that prototypic RSV-A and RSV-B strains differ in their ability to induce nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation, an important step in the cascade of events leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the subsequent induction of the NF-\u03baB responsive genes IL6 and IL8, with RSV-B eliciting significantly lower responses compared to RSV-A [113]. This supports the finding of greater disease severity in subtype A compared to subtype B infections. Studies in cell culture and in vivo models also provide clear evidence that individual RSV type A isolates differ substantially in their infectivity, virulence, and immunopathogenicity [114\u2013118]. Together, these findings strongly suggest that viral characteristics\u2014in interaction with host susceptibility factors\u2014determine disease phenotype, including severity.",

            "text": "The results of studies using molecular techniques for determining the viral etiology of LRTI have shown that between 9 and 44 % of infants with bronchiolitis requiring an emergency department visit or hospitalization are co-infected with 2 or more viruses [61, 119, 120] (see also Table 3). Several analyses show simultaneous infection with more than one respiratory virus to be associated with increased disease severity in infants [39, 60, 121\u2013124], although this is not a consistent finding [53, 57]. In a Dutch community-based study, viral load was significantly associated with disease severity when RSV was the only pathogen detected, but such an association was not evident in infants co-infected with RSV and another respiratory virus [103]. In this study, it was decided to designate the viral agent that was present in higher quantities as the primary pathogen. It remains to be determined, however, whether this is a valid assumption. As a matter of fact, a detailed analysis of clinical characteristics in co-infections compared to single infections showed RSV to dictate the prevalence and severity of clinical features such as obstructive airway disease and hypoxia as well as overall duration of hospitalization, regardless of whether the co-infection involved rhinovirus or adenovirus (AdV) [125]. Only the frequency of fever was significantly higher in RSV-AdV co-infections compared to RSV alone. In contrast, dual infections involving rhinovirus in combination with AdV or influenza virus more often yielded significant differences in the prevalence of individual clinical characteristics. This suggests that simultaneous detection of two or more viruses by RT-PCR is not simply the reflection of lingering viral nucleic acids from a past infection, but truly reflects the simultaneous presence of two (or more) pathogens. Other data suggest that the localization of the virus may also play a role. A substantial portion of nonbronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from infants who required mechanical ventilation because of RSV bronchiolitis were found to contain hMPV RT-PCR products [126]. Although the presence of RSV had been confirmed by antigen detection in nasopharyngeal samples of all the infants, only 24/30 (80 %) of them had detectable RSV amplicons in BAL fluid, but 3 of the RSV-negative BAL samples contained hMPV amplicons. This raises the question of whether the viral agent detected in nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS) is necessarily the agent responsible for lower respiratory symptoms.\n",

FDA approval was based on the results of two randomized clinical trials of prophylaxis with palivizumab [141, 142]. One demonstrated an overall reduction in the rate of RSV hospitalization of 55 %, the relative decrease being 78 % in premature infants (\u226435 weeks gestational age) without CLD of prematurity and 39 % in children with CLD [141]. In 1,287 infants and children \u226424 months of age with hemodynamically significant CHD, palivizumab prophylaxis was associated with a reduction in RSV hospitalization from 9.7 to 5.3 %, corresponding to a relative reduction of 45 % [142]. The results of a number of observational studies confirm that palivizumab is effective in premature infants with or without CLD and in infants with hemodynamically significant CHD [58, 143\u2013145], although they also highlight that compliance with current recommendations for the dosing of palivizumab is suboptimal [146, 147].",

            "text": "There is international agreement that a full course of palivizumab should be given to prematurely born infants with a gestational age of <32 weeks, but considerably variation has developed in the national recommendations for the use of prophylaxis in the group born at a gestational age of between 32 and 35 weeks. Palivizumab is effective in these infants [141], but since this population comprises 3\u20135 % of the annual birth cohort the cost of indiscriminate treatment would be considerable. Consequently, there have been several attempts to develop models that predict which high-risk infants would benefit most from palivizumab prophylaxis [71, 149, 150]. In Canada, use of palivizumab according to the Canadian Risk-Scoring Tool [149] in infants with a GA of 32\u201335 weeks has been shown to be cost-effective [151] and convenient [152]. The modified recommendations of the AAP propose a maximum of 3 monthly doses, instead of the usual 5 monthly doses, in infants born at a gestational age between 32 and 35 days if they are in daycare or have siblings <5 years of age [148]. It should be noted, however, that there may be another approach to improving the effectiveness of palivizumab and simultaneously reducing cost. In almost one third of infants, trough levels after the first palivizumab dose remain below the 40 \u03bcg/ml level that is associated with a 99 % reduction in lung RSV titers in the cotton rat model [153], while trough levels after subsequent doses remain far above this value [141, 142]. A mathematical model for predicting palivizumab serum concentrations suggests that simply shortening the first interval to 23 rather than 30 days would assure adequate serum levels, and this could be followed by administrations of 10 mg/kg every 30 days and still maintain protective levels [154]. Of course, this dosage regimen would have to be tested before being adopted, but it does have the potential for enormous cost savings.",

            "text": "Reinfections with RSV are common throughout life, even though antigenic diversity among RSV strains is rather limited compared to other respiratory viruses, suggesting that protective immunity is incomplete and short-lived. This is at least partly due to the fact that RSV, like other viruses, has developed numerous mechanisms to evade or subvert the host immune response [155] (Fig. 3). The G protein, which together with the F protein is the only RSV antigen inducing neutralizing antibodies, is heavily glycosylated, and this has been shown to interfere with antibody recognition [156, 157]. Another immune evasion mechanism involves the ability to produce the G protein not only in full-length membrane-bound, but also in a truncated secreted form (Fig. 1). The secreted protein may act as a decoy for neutralizing antibodies [155]. In addition, the central conserved region of the G protein contains a CX3C motif, which endows it with the ability to signal through the CX3CR1 receptor and to exert chemotactic activity similar to that of fractalkine (CX3CL1). Whether this interferes or enhances leukocyte recruitment to the infected lung in vivo is unclear from the available data [158]. Sensitization of mice with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the RSV G protein followed by RSV challenge activates primarily CD4+ T cells and results in the induction of eosinophilia in the context of a Th2-dominated immune response, whereas priming with the F protein activates both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells induces mainly type 1 cytokines and lung inflammation [159]. Similarly, human RSV G protein-specific T-cell lines produce interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10, whereas the cytokine profile of F protein-specific T-cell lines is Th1-dominated and similar to that induced by live virus [160]. This implies that the RSV G protein has the potential to downregulate cellular immune responses. There are also data suggesting that the G protein can downregulate inflammatory responses by antagonizing signaling through toll-like receptors (TLRs) [155, 158]. In addition, RSV can infect dendritic cells (DCs), which results in their maturation, but nonetheless reduces their ability to present antigen and activate na\u00efve T cells, thus altering the cytokine milieu through a variety of mechanisms. These include failure to form an immune synapse between DCs and na\u00efve T cells, and the secretion of an inhibitory factor [161]. Furthermore, the NS1 and NS2 proteins of RSV can interfere with the production of type I IFNs, which play a vital role in viral clearance [155, 158].\n",

They show signs of impairment in antigen presentation and T cell stimulation due to decreased expression of MHC class I and II and co-stimulatory molecules and reduced production of cytokines, in particular IL-12p70. The most striking characteristic of neonatal T cell responses is their extraordinary plasticity, ranging from relative unresponsiveness to stimuli that provoke strong responses in adult T cells to the capacity to generate adult-like responses if and when the appropriate stimuli are provided. In many situations, however, CD4+ T cells exhibit a diminished capacity to produce both Th1 and Th2 cytokines. In particular, the mitogen-induced and antigen-specific production of interferon (IFN)\u03b3 does not reach adult levels for several years, possibly not until adolescence [163\u2013166]. Despite this low IFN\u03b3-producing capacity, Th2 skewing has not been clearly demonstrated in human viral infections [162], although it is observed in neonatal mice and in human neonatal responses to environmental allergens [167]. While neonates may exhibit deficient CD8+ T cell responses in some situations, they are clearly capable of developing mature cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses to specific antigens, including viruses [162].",

In addition, infant B cells show little evidence of somatic hypermutations after encounter of their cognate antigen [170], resulting in lower affinity and decreased heterogeneity of the antibody repertoire [162]. The fact that, after the age of \u223c2 years, only individuals who are immunocompromised because of immunodeficiency diseases, chemotherapy, or immunosenescence experience severe lower respiratory tract involvement with RSV infection suggests that the immaturity of the immune system in early childhood is a major factor in the frequent development of LRTI during primary RSV infection [77].",

Primary human respiratory ECs, when cultured at an air\u2013liquid interface, regrow into polarized pseudostratified airway epithelium that contains all the cell types and exhibits all the morphological and functional characteristics of normal respiratory epithelium, including mucus production, ciliary motion, and cytokine and chemokine production [174\u2013177]. This model has been used to confirm that RSV infects the airway epithelium from the apical side only and targets almost exclusively ciliated epithelial cells [175, 177], as already seen in autopsy studies and polarized epithelial cells [171, 172]. Budding and release of the virus also occurs from the apical surface, with subsequent spread via ciliary motion [175]. This results in patchy infection, suggesting that not all ciliated cells are susceptible to RSV infection. Although there is some disagreement over the extent of cytopathology induced by RSV infection, including syncytia formation [174, 175, 177], it has been demonstrated that this model quite faithfully captures many of the features of severe RSV infection in human infants, including apoptosis and sloughing of ECs, mucus hypersecretion due to goblet cell hyperplasia or metaplasia, and the production of various chemokines and cytokines [174, 177].",

            "text": "The RSV receptor has not yet been identified, but nucleolin has recently been identified as a promising candidate [178]. It is known, however, that various extracellular and intracellular pattern recognition receptors, including TLRs 2, 3, 4, and 7, RNA helicases, such as retinoic acid-inducible gene I, and possibly nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors are involved in mediating the early response to RSV via the induction of NF-\u03baB and IFN response factors [179\u2013181]. Upon infection in vitro, airway ECs can produce a variety of cytokines and chemokines, including macrophage inflammatory protein-1a (MIP-1a, CCL3), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1, CCL2), RANTES (regulated on activation, normally T cell-expressed and secreted, CCL5), eotaxin (CCL11), IL-8 (CXCL8), monokine induced by IFN\u03b3 (MIG, CXCL9), IP-10 (CXCL10), fractalkine (CX3CL1), but also the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF\u03b1 [117, 174, 182\u2013186]. Conflicting results have been obtained regarding the ability of RSV to induce production of the antiviral cytokine IFN\u03b1 by airway ECs [177, 187]. The discrepancies may be related to the use of epithelial cell lines compared to primary human ECs, which show differential responses to infection with the same RSV strain [173]. In addition, individual strains of RSV differ markedly in their ability to induce some of these cytokines and chemokines and [117, 118], epithelial cells from different donors show marked variability in the cytokine and chemokine responses to infection with the same RSV strain [117], and both constitutive production and upregulation following RSV infection are dependent on the localization of the epithelial cells in the airways [182, 188]. Either in response to transient infection or to activating signals received from bronchial ECs [189, 190], alveolar macrophages can further enhance the chemokine and cytokine release of bronchial ECs and can themselves contribute to their production [185, 190, 191].",

They comprise chimpanzees, rhesus monkeys, sheep, cotton rats, guinea pigs, and mice [192], with guinea pigs being somewhat unusual in that they develop persistent or even latent infection [193], while there is as yet no clear evidence for persistence of RSV in humans. In addition, there are several pneumoviruses with great similarities to hRSV, namely bovine RSV (bRSV), ovine RSV, and pneumonia virus of mice [192]. Over the entire genome there is approximately 80 % homology between bRSV and hRSV. Polyclonal antibodies specific for hRSV generally recognize bRSV proteins [194]. In particular, bRSV shares many of the features of hRSV, especially the occurrence of most severe disease in young (<6 months) individuals and less severe disease in older animals. The bovine model has the advantage over murine models that BRSV is a pathogen for calves and as such creates a disease that is in most ways identical to RSV in human children. The clinical and pathological features of the bRSV model are described [195].",

However, they are at best a semi-permissive hosts, their lung anatomy is much simpler compared to humans, and the more obvious clinical signs of illness in mice are non-specific and include weight loss, lethargy, and ruffled fur. Acute RSV infection in mice can result in airway obstruction and AHR that can be measured by whole body plethysmography [196\u2013199], although there are certain strains of RSV that do not induce AHR [116, 200]. However, even the most permissive mouse strain, BALB/c, requires a very high intranasal inoculum (generally 106 or 107 PFU) in order to elicit AHR. For comparison, adult humans can develop symptomatic infections with an inoculum of as little as 1,000 PFU [201]. Peak viral titers in the airways or lungs of mice are seen 4\u20135 days after inoculation depending on the size of the inoculum and the virus becomes undetectable by plaque assay by day 7 or 8 postinfection [199, 202].",

Their induction is rapid and generally peaks early, although the individual mediators vary markedly in their kinetics and peak concentrations. Of note, depletion experiments in mice identified macrophages as important direct or indirect contributors to the production of CCL3 and CCL5 as well as TNF\u03b1, IL-6, and IFN\u03b1 [204]. In addition, macrophage depletion significantly reduced the recruitment and activation of natural killer (NK) cells, but did not affect the recruitment of CD4 and CD8 T cells to the lungs. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF\u03b1 induce or upregulate the expression of adhesion molecules, thereby contributing to the retention of recruited immune cells. In addition, they play a central role in the activation of effector cells. Increased levels of these cytokines have been detected BAL fluid early after RSV inoculation [198, 199]. There are indications that TNF\u03b1 contributes both to viral clearance in the early stages of RSV infection and the RSV-induced immunopathology in the later phases, at which time T cells may also contribute to the production of this cytokine [205\u2013207]. In contrast, others found a positive association between TNF\u03b1 levels in BAL and viral load, while IL-6 concentrations correlated with both viral load and disease severity [199].",

            "text": "The concerted action of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the initial phases of RSV infection is associated with marked changes in the cellular composition of BAL fluid and lung tissue. After inoculation of mice with hRSV, there is an early rise in the numbers of neutrophils cells in BAL and lungs [114, 196, 199, 208\u2013215]. However, the magnitude and the kinetics of these changes vary widely between studies and also between mouse strains [216]. NK cells start appearing in the lungs and in BAL \u223c2 days after infection, their numbers reaching a peak on day 4 and rapidly declining thereafter [213\u2013215]. NK cell activity reached a maximum on day 3 and was undetectable by day 8 [213]. NK cells play an important role in viral clearance in the early phase of RSV infection [211]. Eosinophils generally constitute <1 % of total BAL cells in mice and their numbers do not significantly differ between RSV-infected and control animals [139, 196, 217]. There are, however, experimental systems in which a small but significant increase in the number of eosinophils is observed in BAL and among isolated lung cells of RSV-infected mice [218\u2013220]. In some systems, eosinophils also constitute a minor, but significant component of the lung infiltrate [209]. Macrophages always are the major cell type in BAL of mice, and may be further upregulated by RSV infection, although some noted the largest increases by day 6 and not in the early phase [210].",

In BAL of RSV-infected mice, the CD4+ T cell count begins to rise early, reaches a plateau from around day 4 to day 7 or 8, then declines but remains elevated past day 20. On the other hand, CD8+ lymphocyte numbers rise steeply between day 4 and day 8 or 9, then decline, but stay increased past day 20 [204, 210, 211, 213]. Similar kinetics were observed for RSV-specific CD8+ T cells [137, 204]. Lymphocyte recruitment coincides or is preceded by a second peak in the production of certain chemokines around days 4\u20136, including MIG, MIP-1\u03b1, RANTES and eotaxin [185, 198, 199]. While perivascular edema and necrotic cellular debris may be evident in the mouse lung as early as 1 day after RSV inoculation [114], the neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages that dominate the early inflammation are only beginning to marginate at this time [199]. At the peak of inflammation \u223c7 days postinfection, there is a dense perivascular and peribronchial infiltrate that reaches into the alveolar spaces and is composed predominantly of macrophages and lymphocytes with some neutrophils [199, 212, 225].",

            "text": "It is well established that both CD4 and CD8 T cells are required for efficient viral clearance in RSV-infected mice [225\u2013227]. However, it is equally evident that both T lymphocyte subsets contribute to the pathology of RSV infection since clinical illness is markedly reduced after depletion of either CD4 or CD8 T cells and is essentially absent in mice depleted of both [225]. Conversely, the transfer of RSV-specific CTL results in rapid viral clearance in immunocompromised (irradiated) and immunocompetent animals, with the rate of viral clearance depending on the number of transferred cells [227]. At the same time, recipients of high numbers of RSV-specific CTL developed weight loss, ruffled fur, and respiratory distress in association with increased pulmonary inflammation. At the highest CTL numbers, almost all recipients died. Similar results have been obtained with less purified RSV-specific CD8+ T cells [226]. Recipients of RSV-specific CD4+ T lymphocytes also showed enhanced viral clearance, but increased lung pathology, and while passive transfer of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells enhanced polymorphonuclear lymphocyte efflux, transfer of CD4+ lymphocytes was associated with pronounced eosinophilia. There are indications that both the perforin/granzyme pathway and Fas\u2013FasL interactions play a role in the cytotoxic activity of RSV-specific CTL, although deletion of either of these pathways alone only delays, but does not prevent, viral clearance [206, 228].",

            "text": "From the currently available data, it is clear that there is an early influx of both conventional and plasmacytoid DCs (cDCs and pDCs) into the lungs and lung-draining lymph nodes of RSV-infected mice [229\u2013232]. However, the kinetics of this influx and the persistence of individual DC subsets in the lungs remain highly controversial. Some data indicate that the increase in pDC numbers is sustained until at least day 21 postinfection [229, 231]. In marked contrast, other investigators report only a transient early increase in pDCs, whereas cDCs remained elevated until at least day 18 in the lung, though they had returned to baseline levels on day 14 in the lymph nodes [230]. Depletion of pDCs results in decreased viral clearance, enhanced inflammation in the airways and lung parenchyma, increased mucus production and prolonged RSV-induced AHR [229, 231]. This indicates that pDCs play an essential role in limiting viral replication and regulating inflammatory responses and changes in lung function. There is also controversy regarding the ability of RSV to induce production of IFN\u03b1 by murine pDCs [187, 229, 230] and concerning the question of whether pDCs or bronchial ECs are the major source of IFN\u03b1 production in the lungs of RSV-infected mice [187, 231]. Whatever the cellular source may be, IFN\u03b1 is upregulated in BAL fluid of RSV-infected mice [187, 231, 233]. Exogenous IFN\u03b1 enhanced viral clearance in normal and pDC-depleted mice [231, 234], but had no effect on AHR in either group of mice, indicating that pDCs modulate airway disease through mechanisms other than IFN\u03b1 production [231].",

It is well established that cellular immune responses and the production of IFN\u03b3 are essential for the elimination of viruses. Mice develop a strong type 1 immune response to RSV, characterized by a substantial induction of IFN\u03b3 mRNA and protein in lung and BAL fluid [198, 199, 235\u2013238]. NK cells are the major source of this cytokine in the early phase of infection [211, 213, 214]. Since NK cells are also the major producers of granzyme B during this stage, NK cell-depleted mice show not only a pronounced reduction of IFN\u03b3 concentrations in lung tissue and BAL, but also a marked increase in viral load [211, 214]. In addition, they exhibit elevated Th2 cytokine levels (IL-4 and IL-13), tissue eosinophil infiltration, and IgE production [214], although reportedly there was no effect of NK cell depletion on the RSV-induced cytokine profile in another study [211].",

However, there are data indicating that IFN\u03b3 production after RSV infection of mice is independent of IL-12 and IL-18 [242]. Nonetheless, comparison of mouse strains that differ in their susceptibility to RSV-induced AHR led to the identification of IL-12 as an important mediator of protection from pulmonary inflammation, mucus production, and AHR in B6 mice, and this was confirmed through the use of neutralizing anti-IL-12 antibodies [238]. In other experiments, absence of IL-12 signaling due to IL-12 receptor deficiency on a C57BL/10 background was associated with reduced NK cell function (but similar NK cell numbers) and delayed viral clearance compared to wild-type mice [243]. In contrast, BALB/c mice with a targeted deletion of the IL-12p40 gene BAL exhibited both reduced NK cell numbers and function. However, the generation of virus-specific CTL and their functional activities were not affected by IL-12p40 deficiency. When mice were infected with a recombinant RSV expressing murine IL-18, viral clearance was enhanced in association with increased recruitment of NK cells, but weight loss was also much more pronounced [211].",

However, neonatal immune in responses in mice are also immature, and neonatally infected mice were found to elaborate significantly lower IFN\u03b3 levels in BAL fluid, whereas IL-13 concentrations in lung tissue were significantly higher compared to mice infected as weanlings [244]. Mice infected as weanlings (3 weeks old) developed AHR upon primary infection, but not when reinfected 5 weeks later despite evidence of increased airway inflammation. In contrast, mice initially infected at <1 week of age and reinfected 5 weeks later showed further enhancement of AHR compared to age-matched controls undergoing primary infection. This enhanced AHR was associated with IL-13-induced eosinophilia and mucus production, although IFN\u03b3 levels were comparable to those seen after primary or secondary infection in weanling mice.",

            "text": "The role of IL-13 has been investigated primarily in the context of RSV-induced AHR, because of the central role of this cytokine in allergic inflammatory airway disease [245]. There is strong evidence that individual laboratory strains and clinical isolates of RSV differ markedly in their ability to upregulate IL-13 production in the lungs of mice [114\u2013116]. They also showed differential induction of AHR, but this did not appear to be directly correlated with the pulmonary levels of IL-13. Nonetheless, AHR after infection with IL-13 inducing RSV strains was greatly attenuated in IL-13 deficient mice [116] or after neutralization of IL-13 with polyclonal antibodies [246]. This was associated with a significant increase in IL-12 in lung supernatants and decrease in mucus production, which has been observed in other studies of RSV infection in mice [244] and is consistent with the known ability of IL-13 to induce goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus production [245]. This may explain why a RSV strain that did not enhance pulmonary IL-13 levels failed to induce AHR [116, 200, 247]. It does not explain, however, why other researchers did not see a reduction in RSV-induced AHR after inhibition of IL-13 signaling or in IL-13-deficient mice, even though the strain they used greatly upregulated IL-13 levels in the lung [209]. This is particularly noteworthy since neutralization of IL-13 decreased the levels of IL-5 in BAL, increased the concentration of IL-12 and virtually abolished the increased mucus production seen after RSV infection. In similar experimental models, IL-5-dependent eosinophilia has been implicated in RSV-induced AHR [220].",

Transgenic expression of IL-10 in the nasal mucosa resulted in significantly reduced viral replication in the nasal mucosa and the lung in association with increased cytotoxic activity of nasal CD4+ T cells [249]. There is some disagreement over whether Tregs or conventional CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes constitute the major source of IL-10 in the lungs of RSV-infected mice [136, 215, 248]. There is consensus, however, that the absence of IL-10 signaling either due to genetic IL-10 deficiency or IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) blockade increases disease severity and inflammation. Specifically, it enhances the recruitment of monocytes, neutrophils and effector lymphocytes [215, 248]. The numbers of RSV-specific CD8+ T cells and their IFN\u03b3 production were increased in the absence of IL-10 signaling, as were the numbers of IL-17A-producing CD4+ T cells [136]. Furthermore, IL-10R blockade was associated with a reduction in the number of Helios+ Foxp3+ CD4+ T cells, suggesting that IL-10 plays a role in maintaining natural Tregs.",

            "text": "Indeed, very similar effects have been observed following the depletion of Tregs. Following infection of BALB/c mice with RSV, there is a rapid and dramatic increase in the absolute and relative numbers of Foxp3+ Tregs among CD4+ T cells in the airway, lung parenchyma and lung-draining lymph nodes [138, 217]. The results of three independent depletion experiments in BALB/c [138, 217] and hybrid CB6F1 mice [137] demonstrate that these Tregs play a vital role in regulating the recruitment of innate (NK cells and neutrophils) and, particularly in the later stages of the disease, of adaptive (T and B lymphocytes) immune cells. Whether this accelerates viral clearance is somewhat controversial. In addition, Tregs dampen the production of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines [137, 217], including the production of TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 by virus-specific CTL [137, 138], and control the trafficking of virus-specific CD8 T cells from the lymph node into the lung [138]. The results from the hybrid CB6F1 model further suggest that Tregs also play a role in moderating disparities in epitope dominance [137]. As a result, Tregs are central in diminishing disease severity, including overall morbidity and weight loss [137, 138, 217]. Interestingly, the depletion of Tregs in CB6F1 mice was associated with increased pulmonary levels of IL-10 [137], suggesting that IL-10 alone is not sufficient for suppression of the RSV-induced immunopathology and that the effects of IL-10 deficiency or IL-10R blockade are largely mediated by the failure to maintain adequate numbers of Tregs [136]. The anti-CD25 antibody that was used in these studies for depletion of Tregs also eliminates activated CD25+ T cells. \u201cDepletion of regulatory T cell\u201d mice allow the specific depletion of Foxp3+ Tregs. While weight loss was even more dramatic in these mice, the overall results were similar, with the notable difference that viral load was decreased in Treg depleted mice [139]. Conversely, increasing the number of Tregs via IL-2 immune complexes decreased inflammation and accelerated recovery. Interestingly, the Tregs in the lung parenchyma and airways of RSV-infected mice were found to express granzyme B, and this was found to be essential for the regulatory function of Tregs in RSV infection.",

This signals, through their common receptor, neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R), resulting in the production of IL-17A and related cytokines, including, IL-6, IL-21, IL-23, and IL-1\u03b2. Mice deficient in C3aR or NK-1R did not exhibit increased airway resistance following RSV infection. This was associated with markedly reduced pulmonary inflammation and a different composition of the inflammatory infiltrate (decreased neutrophils, and increased macrophages and lymphocytes) compared to wild-type controls.

Prophylactic blockade of NK-1R signaling was accompanied by reduced airway lymphocytic inflammation. In addition, it prevented the RSV-induced development of airway smooth muscle responsiveness to electric field stimulation. This suggests that substance P plays a dual role in the development of AHR during acute RSV infection, namely proinflammatory and neurogenic. Others found both prophylactic and therapeutic neutralization of substance P to be effective in reducing lung inflammation, and addition of anti-F protein antibodies did not significantly enhance this effect [252]. The involvement of substance P in neurogenic inflammation is supported by a variety of studies in RSV-infected rats and other animals [253]. The results from these experiments implicate the RSV-induced upregulation of nerve growth factor (NGF) and its receptors and the subsequent increase in the expression of NK-1R (at least at the transcript level) along with functional interactions between substance P-containing neurons and mast cells and their inflammatory mediators in the exaggerated neurogenic inflammation [253].

RSV-infected mice produce RSV-specific serum IgM, followed by IgG, predominantly of the IgG2a isotype, in agreement with their strong type 1 cytokine response [254, 255]. In addition, their BAL fluid contains RSV-specific IgA. In the absence of humoral responses, viral clearance is not affected, but lung inflammation is more severe and viral replication and clinical illness after rechallenge with RSV are more pronounced compared to animals with an intact B cell compartment [256]. Whether elaboration of RSV-specific antibodies or administration of passive antibodies suppresses viral replication in the lower respiratory tract only or also in the upper respiratory tract appears to depend on the specific animal model [255, 257].",

However, bRSV-infected calves also exhibit RSV-specific IgE [260] and hRSV-infected guinea pigs produce RSV-specific antibodies of the IgG1 subclass, the major anaphylactic antibody in this species [261]. Guinea pigs are capable of producing IgE antibodies. Since only low levels of RSV-IgE are detectable in the late stages of acute infection, with peak concentrations occurring \u223c3 weeks after infection, the production of virus-specific IgE is likely to become relevant only during reinfection. Indeed, in neonatally infected mice, virus-specific IgE was shown to play a central role in mediating enhanced AHR upon reinfection [262]. Similarly, passive sensitization of adult mice with RSV-IgE 2 days after inoculation with live virus resulted in a significant augmentation of RSV-induced AHR [259].",

They include the CC chemokines RANTES (CCL5), MCP-1 (CCL2), MIP-1\u03b1 (CCL3), MIP-1\u03b2 (CCL4), and eotaxin (CCL11); and the CXC chemokines IL-8 (CXCL8) and interferon inducible protein 10 (IP-10, CXCL10) [263\u2013271]. Fewer data are available on their role in less severe RSV infection not requiring hospitalization, but some of them are also detected in nasal secretions of infants and children with URTI [184, 267, 272] and experimentally infected adults [201, 273]. Concentrations of IL-8, MIP-1\u03b1, and MCP-1 were found to directly correlate with various measures of disease severity [267\u2013269, 274], whereas MCP-1 levels were inversely associated with the duration of supplemental oxygen requirement [275]. This suggests that chemokines, by recruiting specific leukocyte subsets, play a major role in determining the degree of inflammation and the composition of the inflammatory infiltrate and, consequently, the disease severity. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF\u03b1 have also been detected in nasal or nasopharyngeal secretions and tracheal aspirate of RSV-infected infants at significantly higher levels compared to controls [266, 269, 276, 277]. When nasal brush samples were investigated for the proportion of cells expressing various cytokines, IL-6-positive cells were present in both bronchiolitis and URTI, but were significantly increased compared to controls only in patients with bronchiolitis [278]. Serum or plasma concentrations of IL6 are also significantly higher during acute RSV infection [279, 280] and were found to correlate with disease severity, including a clinical severity score, duration of oxygen therapy, and duration of hospitalization [279], whereas levels in airway secretions did not [269, 279].",

Their numbers are highest in the first few days after intubation and progressively decline thereafter, in parallel with a decline in the total BAL cell count [276]. Of note, the absolute and relative numbers of neutrophils in BAL from RSV-infected preterm infants were found to be significantly lower compared to RSV-infected term infants and similar to those of uninfected controls. Eosinophils are detected in a minority of RSV-infected infants and generally constitute <1 % of the total BAL cell number, which is similar to control values [276, 281, 282]. In a separate study, when bronchoscopic BAL was performed in infants and young children with RSV bronchiolitis, 6/22 patients had eosinophil proportions >2 standard deviations above normal (mean 2.3 % of BAL cells) and were classified as eosinophil positive [283]. This subgroup of patients may represent a specific subtype of RSV bronchiolitis that exhibits some of the characteristics seen in children with an acute asthma attack, including higher BAL concentrations of IL-5 and cysteinyl leukotriene levels (LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4) compared to the eosinophil-negative groups [283, 284].\n",

However, due to the massive influx of neutrophils during RSV infection, the percentage of CD8+ T cells in BAL is actually lower in severe RSV disease compared to controls (1.6 vs. 8 %). NK cells represented only 0.4 % of total BAL cells [282]. In tracheal aspirates, CD3+ T lymphocytes also constituted only a small portion (1.6\u20132.1 %) of total cells recovered, with CD8+ T and NK cells representing 0.6\u20131.3 % and 0.5\u20131.1 % of total cells, respectively [285].",

Like mice, infants naturally infected with RSV showed an increase in the numbers of cDCs (also called myeloid DCs) and pDCs in nasal washings in association with a decrease in both DC subsets in peripheral blood compared to healthy controls [265, 287].

Edema and the occluding material in the airway lumen, possibly in conjunction with protrusions of hyperplastic bronchiolar-associated lymphoid tissue, contribute to the obstruction of airways. Whereas older investigations highlight the importance of mucus in this process [288], mucus represents a minor component or is absent from the material occluding RSV-infected airways in recent analyses [171, 289]. The desquamation of ECs is generally deemed to reflect necrosis, but markers of apoptosis are abundant in the RSV-infected epithelium [289, 290], and recent in vitro results confirm that ECs sloughed from RSV-infected epithelium are TUNEL positive, indicative of apoptosis [177].",

In contrast, a recent assessment of autopsy tissue from 9 infants with fatal RSV infection revealed the near absence of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes from the infiltrate [291], which is consistent with the observation that a majority of CD3+ T cells were double negative, but contrasts with the finding of a prominent CD8+ T cell component in the alveolar infiltrate described in the case of non-fatal RSV bronchiolitis [171].

            "text": "Whereas animal studies clearly indicate a role for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells not only in viral clearance, but also in the lung immunopathology after RSV infection, the role of T lymphocytes in human disease is less clear. Several lines of evidence suggest that CD8 T cells do not play a major role in the immune pathology of RSV. Postmortem lung tissue obtained from infants (median age 3 months, range 1\u201312 months) who had died from severe RSV infection contained very few detectable CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, CD56+ NK cells, or granzyme-positive cells [291]. In contrast, lung tissue from a child with ambulatory RSV infection showed evidence of a prominent CD8+ T lymphocyte infiltrate, particularly in the alveoli [171]. Together, these findings suggest not only that these cells do not participate in the damage of the bronchiolar epithelium typical of severe RSV infection, but also that an inadequate T cell response may underlie the development of severe fatal RSV LRTI. A marked increase in the CD8+ T cell count has been observed in NB-BAL of infants with severe, but non-fatal RSV infection, and these cells exhibit an activated phenotype, including significantly higher expression of granzyme B compared to controls [282]. However, the magnitude of the T cell response did not correlate with any measure of clinical disease severity. In addition, the T cell response in peripheral blood, whether detected by RSV-specific tetramer staining or by measuring the total activated T cell population, peaked at the time of extubation, i.e., during the recovery phase approximately 9\u201312 days after the onset of symptoms. A further study from the same institution confirmed these findings in another group of infants with severe RSV infection and extended them to the observation that peripheral blood CD8+ T cell responses peaked well after the peak viral load, which was maximal before or on the day of admission to the ICU, and also took place after the greatest symptom severity, which occurred 2\u20133 days after admission to the ICU [294]. Similarly, the concentrations and activity of granzyme A and B were significantly elevated in tracheal aspirates of RSV-infected patients compared to controls without pulmonary conditions [285]. However, there was no association between granzyme levels and a marker of epithelial apoptosis or markers of disease severity. Furthermore, the most severe disease is generally observed in very young infants, but infants \u22645 months of age were found to have RSV-specific cellular cytotoxic responses much less frequently compared to children 6\u201324 months of age (38 vs. 67 %) during acute RSV infection [295]. Of note, detectable responses arose only 7 days or more following infection, but waned again in the youngest infants, while many of the 6\u201324 month-old children exhibiting sustained responses 2\u20133 months after the acute infection. This suggests that repeated boosting is required before cellular cytotoxic responses are sustained between RSV outbreaks.",

In mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), IFN\u03b3 secretion was found to be unchanged or even reduced in RSV-infected infants compared to controls [129, 296\u2013298]. It was also considerably lower than seen after other respiratory viruses [296] regardless of whether RSV was the sole virus detected or combined with another viral agent [125]. There are conflicting data concerning the simultaneous upregulation of Th2 cytokines, with some investigations showing a Th2 dominance [297, 298], whereas others are unable to detect IL-4 or IL-5 [129]. There is also controversy regarding the precise role of IFN\u03b3 production by PBMC, with a positive correlation with disease severity seen in one study [298], whereas other data suggest a protective effect [129].",

This was accompanied by enhanced production of IL-2, IL-4, and IL-13 in one study, suggesting a mixed Th1 and Th2 immune response [299], but was associated with little IL-4 and IL-10 secretion in another investigation, suggesting skewing towards a Th1 immune response [280]. There were no significant differences between the cytokine responses of infants with severe and those with mild RSV disease, although the T cell response was somewhat more pronounced in the acute phase in the mild disease group. Importantly there was no evidence of Th2 skewing in the more severely affected infants. Memory responses of RSV-stimulated PBMC of adults are characterized by strong production of IFN\u03b3 as well as IL-10 and IL-6 in essentially all 60 subjects examined, but IL-13 and IL-5 in only 31 % and 8 %, respectively [301].",

            "text": "RSV infection is largely confined to the respiratory tract, even though RSV RNA has been detected in blood monocytes and neutrophils [302, 303]. Therefore, the responses of PBMC may not accurately reflect the local immune responses occurring in the respiratory tract, particularly since it has been shown that RSV-specific CD8+ T cells as well as CD8+ T lymphocytes specific for other respiratory viruses decrease in blood and increase in the respiratory tract even in patients who have only upper respiratory tract symptoms [304], indicating recruitment to the lung. There have been numerous investigations of the cytokine profile in airway secretions during acute RSV infections [11, 101, 267, 275, 305\u2013308]. Note, the concentrations of mediators in samples from the upper airways generally show moderate to strong correlations with those of specimens obtained simultaneously from the lower airways of mechanically ventilated infants [101, 308]. The results are similarly conflicting as those obtained in PBMC. While some investigations show clear upregulation of IFN\u03b3 in acute RSV infection compared to healthy controls [267, 305] or non-RSV-related bronchiolitis [275], others find IFN\u03b3 to be undetectable in the majority of patients [306], or not to differ significantly compared to controls [287]. Increased concentrations of Th2 cytokines are seen in some studies [11], particularly in infants \u22643 months of age [306], whereas others found them to be undetectable or present at very low levels and not to differ significantly from controls [129, 274, 275, 305, 308, 309]. Consequently, a polarization towards a Th2 immune response has been observed in one cohort of patients with ambulatory LRTI compared to those with URTI only [11], whereas other data suggest Th2-skewing in both URTI and hypoxic bronchiolitis, but not in non-hypoxic bronchiolitis [267]. Data from an earlier study from the same institution indicate a higher IFN\u03b3:IL-4 ratio in subjects with bronchiolitis compared to those with URTI only [308]. Accordingly, IFN\u03b3 can be (1) associated with protection from most severe disease [11, 101, 274, 275, 309], (2) have no clear role in determining disease severity [267, 307], or (3) be implicated as a major mediator of immunopathology in different patient cohorts [308]. Note that analysis of cytokine mRNA responses in NPA and BAL samples underscores that there is great inter-individual variation in the expression of Th1 and Th2 cytokines and the dominant cytokine pattern [310].",

One of the most obvious is the common practice of reporting absolute cytokine concentrations in NPA or nasal lavage specimens, even though the lavage procedure or the rinsing of the trap introduces an unknown dilution factor. Age is another factor with the potential to influence the results [306], particularly in studies that include mechanically ventilated infants since these are frequently significantly younger than non-ventilated infants [101, 309]. There is a marked age-dependence in the production of IFN\u03b3 and IL-12 and responsiveness to IL-12, an important inducer of type 1 immune responses [166, 311\u2013313]. Even if IFN\u03b3 synthesis in RSV-infected airways does not seem to require IL-12 and IL-18 [307], which is consistent with experimental results [242], IL-12 and IL-18 may have effects that are independent of their role in the induction of IFN\u03b3 and protect from the development of bronchiolitis [278].",

It is unclear to what extent this is relevant to RSV infection in human infants. Disease severity and particularly the involvement of the lower respiratory tract diminish after the primary infection [14] and there is little information on whether the immune response pattern is maintained or changes during secondary infections.",

Some investigators find an association between atopy and higher IL-10 production during acute RSV infection [315] while others do not [316]. Furthermore, the levels of IL-10 in nasopharyngeal or tracheal samples can be directly or inversely associated with disease severity [269, 275, 279]. These discrepancies may be attributable to small sample sizes and methodological issues, but may also relate to the fact that IL-10 has both pro-inflammatory and regulatory functions, and the timing and intensity of its production may determine whether it is protective or detrimental. In addition, animal data demonstrate that individual strains of RSV differ in their ability to induce IL-10 [116].",

            "text": "In addition to chemokines and cytokines, a variety of other inflammatory mediators have been detected in the nasal wash, NPS, or tracheal aspirate samples of RSV-infected infants and young children. These include leukotrienes (LTs) and products of eosinophil degranulation, such as eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) or eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN). In particular ECP and EDN are detected at significantly higher levels and in a significantly higher proportion of patients with RSV compared to healthy controls [306, 317\u2013319]. The levels of ECP were also significantly higher in infants and children with RSV bronchiolitis compared to those with LRTI without wheezing and lowest in those with URTI only and correlated with disease severity as measured by initial oxygen saturation [318]. Other investigators detected an association between IFN\u03b3 concentrations and levels of EDN [305] or leukotriene C4 levels [308]. This may reflect the ability of IFN\u03b3 to activate eosinophils and prolong their survival. Interestingly, peripheral eosinophil counts are reduced in the majority of studies [129, 320, 321], but peripheral eosinophilia has also been reported [322, 323]. The frequent detection of high levels of products of eosinophil degranulation is particularly noteworthy given that eosinophils are rarely found in BAL fluid or nasopharyngeal samples or in postmortem lung tissue of RSV-infected infants [171, 276, 281]. This paradox is most clearly illustrated by the observation that nasopharyngeal lavage samples from infants hospitalized for RSV disease contained numerous cells that stained positive for ECP while the number of eosinophils expressing the BMK-13 marker was low [280]. It should be noted, however, that ECP may not be as specific a marker for eosinophils as is generally assumed. It has been demonstrated that neutrophils are capable of synthesizing and secreting ECP upon stimulation with specific antigens or anti-IgE antibodies [324]. Some nasopharyngeal lavage samples from RSV-infected infants contain IgE-positive cell [280], and RSV-specific IgE antibodies have been detected in NPS samples from infants with bronchiolitis [325\u2013327], even though some failed to detect any in nasal washes [328].",

            "text": "In the age group that most frequently experiences primary RSV infection, the immune system is still immature and maternally derived antibodies can still be present at relatively high levels. Passively acquired maternal antibodies are detectable in essentially all neonates, though at greatly varying titers [89, 90]. Their levels decline with a half-life of \u223c26 days [89] in agreement with the half-lives of endogenous and exogenous IgG antibodies. The highest risk of RSV LRTI severe enough to require hospitalization is seen at an age (2\u20136 months) when maternal antibodies are still present. This not only shows that RSV can cause infection in the presence of maternal antibodies, but raises the question of whether maternal antibodies may actually enhance rather than prevent disease. There are, however, numerous studies showing that the titers of maternally derived neutralizing antibodies are inversely associated with RSV infection overall [91, 92], or with the severity of RSV disease [16, 93\u201396]. In addition, palivizumab prophylaxis substantially reduces the risk of hospitalization for RSV LRTI in high-risk infants [141, 142]. Nonetheless, the presence of maternal antibodies can further limit the already weak ability to mount antibody responses observed in infants [331, 334], as confirmed through the use of passive antibodies in experimental animals [257]. The immaturity of the neonatal immune system also contributes to the suppression of an active serum and mucosal antibody response [331, 334]. For example, it has been shown that the postinfection IgA antibody response to the RSV F protein correlates with age, while preexisting maternally derived antibodies determine the magnitude of the IgA response to the G protein [331]. Consequently, clear (three- or fourfold) increases in serum and/or nasal wash concentrations of RSV G or F protein-specific IgG and IgA are not seen in all infants after primary RSV infection [89, 328]. The ability to elaborate neutralizing antibodies is equally limited. There are data suggesting that this relative inability to develop neutralizing antibodies contributes to the high rate of reinfections observed in infants and young children [9]. In adults, neutralizing F and G protein-specific antibody titers correlate with (incomplete) protection from reinfection, whereas the role of nasal IgA is somewhat more controversial [335, 336].",

In keeping with the observation that infant B cells show little evidence of somatic hypermutations after encounter of their cognate antigen [170], the antibody variable genes of RSV-specific B cells from these infants showed fewer somatic mutations compared to adults [337]. This concurs with the finding that infant RSV-specific antibodies exhibit low avidity [330], which is likely to contribute to the heightened vulnerability of infants to reinfection.",

            "text": "The role of TLR4 in the innate immune response to RSV infection is somewhat controversial. In vitro, RSV ligation of TLR4 on airway epithelial cell lines was shown to enhance viral entry and replication via MyD88- and p38 MAPK-dependent mechanisms, with the latter playing a role in intracellular viral trafficking and virion disassembly [348]. TLR4 was also found to mediate the in vitro response of macrophages to purified RSV F protein, but not G or N protein, in a CD14-dependent manner [349]. Studies in TLR4-deficient mice have yielded conflicting results, with some showing delayed viral clearance in association with decreased NK and CD14+ cell recruitment to the lung, deficient NK cell cytotoxicity and reduced numbers of IL-12 producing cells [350], while others were unable to replicate any of these results [243]. The specific genetic background of the TLR4-deficient mice and the controls may have been a major reason for these discrepancies. In yet another TLR4-deficient mouse strain, TLR4 played a critical role in NF-\u03baB activation in the initial response to RSV infection, though not in the later phases [351]. Activation of this transcription factor is an essential step in the induction or upregulation of numerous cytokines, chemokines and other inflammatory mediators. A subset of infants (8/26) with RSV bronchiolitis showed upregulation of TLR4 expression on peripheral blood monocytes; the procurement of samples a mean of 7.5 days after disease onset may have precluded the detection of such enhanced expression in a substantially larger proportion of patients [352]. In these eight infants, the levels of TLR4 expression correlated negatively with minimal oxygen saturation. In contrast, expression of TLR4 on BAL and peripheral neutrophils was significantly reduced in infants with RSV bronchiolitis compared to controls [353].",

This may be one of the reasons why heterozygosity was not identified as a risk factor in other investigations of the TLR4 SNPs in RSV disease. The 299Gly and 399Ile alleles were overrepresented in Jewish children hospitalized with RSV compared to RSV-infected outpatients [357], whereas the wild-type A allele of the Asp299Gly polymorphism tended to be more frequent, and the rare G allele less frequent (p = 0.052), in black South African patients hospitalized with RSV disease compared to healthy infants [347]. All controls carried the C allele of the Thr399Ile polymorphism, and \u223c1 % of cases carried the T allele (not statistically significant). Of note, neither the Asp299Gly nor the Thr399Ile polymorphisms were present in a Japanese population [358].

However, data from one of the Finnish studies suggest that the genetic risk associated with the TLR4 Aps299Gly polymorphism varies between RSV epidemics [360]. When subjects recruited during two epidemics that occurred several years apart were analyzed separately, the homozygous genotype was associated with protection from severe RSV disease in one epidemic, but associated with risk of severe infection in the other. This suggests that complex interactions between host genotype and viral strain may be involved in determining disease severity. It is conceivable, for example, that dampened immune responses to a mildly virulent strain may be appropriate and prevent massive tissue damage, but may be inefficient and result in more severe infection in the presence of a highly virulent strain.",

            "text": "Surfactant proteins (SPs) are not only essential for proper alveolar function by maintaining appropriate surface tension, but can modulate innate immune responses [363]. In the case of RSV infection, this may involve the ability of SP-A and SP-D to modulate TLR4 signaling events as well as the capacity to interact directly with RSV, although the precise nature and effect of these interactions remains controversial [363\u2013365]. SP-A was found to enhance uptake of RSV by PBMC and U937 macrophages, to further upregulate RSV-induced production of TNF\u03b1 by PBMC, to reverse the RSV-induced suppression of TNF\u03b1 production in U937 macrophages, and to augment IL-10 production in both cell types [366]. SP-A-deficient mice exhibited higher viral titers at all time-points, suggesting a role for SP-A in decreasing infectivity or increasing viral clearance or both [208]. These animals also showed significantly higher pulmonary levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-6, but these may have been produced by cell types other than alveolar macrophages. Surfactants are produced by type II pneumocytes, which can be infected by RSV [171]. This may account for the observation that concentrations of SP-A and SP-D were reduced in the lungs of infants with severe RSV LRTI; however, they were not associated with disease severity [367]. The results of three small randomized trials suggest that surfactant therapy may reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of stay in the ICU in critically ill infants [368].",

Determination of the haplotype structure by identifying 8 novel SNPs in the IL8 gene and its promoter did not greatly help in refining the association of IL8 \u2212251 A with bronchiolitis because two common haplotypes dominated in Europeans. However, the \u2212251A +781T haplotype was associated with disease susceptibility by TDT, while a rare haplotype including \u2212251A and +781C was not. This haplotype was shown to correlate with higher IL-8 transcript levels, and this was not attributable to the \u2212251A polymorphism, but involved differential effects of the intronic +781 polymorphic site on transcription factor binding in the promoter region [382]. An association between disease severity and a haplotype with higher promoter activity agrees with studies showing an association between higher IL-8 protein levels in airway secretions of RSV-infected infants and increased disease severity [269\u2013271]. In marked contrast, when comparing 101 Chinese children hospitalized with RSV-positive pneumonia to 108 children with RSV-negative pneumonia, the IL-8 \u2212251T allele was significantly associated with RSV pneumonia, as was the TT genotype and also the \u2212251T-781C haplotype in logistic regression analysis [383]. In a German population, no association between the \u2212251A/T or the 781 C/T SNPs and RSV bronchiolitis was detected at the allele, genotype or haplotype level [384]. Polymorphisms in the IL8RA gene (encoding the IL-8 receptor alpha) also showed no association with RSV bronchiolitis.",

            "text": "The role of Th2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, in the immunopathology of human RSV infection remains controversial because their concentrations in nasopharyngeal secretions were higher compared to IFN\u03b3 in some cohorts [266, 267] and particularly in infants \u22643 months of age [306], whereas others found them to be undetectable or present at very low levels [274, 275, 309]. The \u2212589C/T and \u22121112C/T in the IL4 and IL13 gene, respectively, are associated with altered transcriptional regulation [385, 386]. Forton et al. [387] analyzed a total of 113 SNPs in 11 genes located in the 5q31 region, which includes the type 2 cytokine gene cluster, in 780 cases with severe RSV bronchiolitis and 1045 controls, all British of European extraction, using a haplotype tagging approach. They obtained highly significant results for SNPs across the IL4 gene and its promoter, with rs2243250 (the promoter polymorphism \u2212589C/T) yielding the highest OR at the allele and genotype level in the subset of infants without known risk factors for severe RSV disease. The rs20541 polymorphism in IL13 (Arg130Gln) also was a significant risk factor for RSV bronchiolitis. A risk haplotype spanning IL13, conserved non-coding sequence-1, and IL4 carried the strongest risk, suggesting that the association signal arises from another unobserved SNP or more complex genetic interactions. The rs2243250 polymorphism (\u2212589C/T) in the IL4 promoter region was not identified as a risk factor in a German cohort [388]. However, all three investigated IL-13 polymorphisms were found to be in strong linkage disequilibrium with the IL-4 \u2212589C/T SNP. And while the 1112C/T polymorphism of IL13 alone was significantly associated with severe RSV disease the inclusion of the IL4 promoter SNP in the analysis of the possible IL-13 haplotypes increased the significance of the association with RSV bronchiolitis by a factor of 10.",

            "text": "One of the most intensely debated issues in research on RSV infection and its late sequelae is the question of whether RSV bronchiolitis is causally involved in the development of asthma or whether the two entities share a common predisposition. A causal association was suggested by the early findings of Th2-skewing (of the mitogen-stimulated PBMC response) during severe RSV disease, which is characteristic of atopic asthma [296, 297]. This was further supported by the discovery that a considerable portion of infants hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis develop virus-specific IgE and a variety of mediators implicated in asthma, including ECP, EDN, LTs, and histamine [264, 318, 325]. Furthermore, RSV-specific IgE and histamine were detected almost exclusively in patients with bronchiolitis [325], although this was not confirmed in another study [326]. In addition, virus-specific IgE was found to be associated with the development of postbronchiolitic wheezing [429]. Based on these observations, it was hypothesized that the elaboration of Th2 cytokines in response to RSV infection could promote the sensitization to inhalant allergens. Allergic sensitization usually occurs early in life and during a time that overlaps with the period of greatest risk for severe LRTI due to RSV. This would then promote atopic asthma, which is thought to be the most common form of childhood asthma in developing countries. Since the actual infection with RSV runs a self-limiting course of 1\u20132 weeks and RSV-specific memory responses are short-lived, this hypothesis often invokes recurrent RSV infections. This may not be necessary, however, since there is growing evidence that the immune response to RSV is not as short-lived as has long been assumed. For example, the proportions of PBMC expressing CD4, CD23 (low-affinity IgE receptor), and the activation marker CD25 were significantly increased 5 months after the bronchiolitis episode [321]. At the same time point, PBMC from subjects who wheezed produced more IL-4 in response to stimulation with house dust-mite antigen. Similarly, serum samples obtained during convalescence (10\u2013153 days after presentation) from RSV infection were found to contain significantly elevated levels of soluble CD25 [430]. In RSV-infected mice, the levels of DCs remain elevated in the lung for at least 21 days after viral inoculation [229\u2013232]. Both pDCs and cDCs in the lung play a central role in determining whether tolerance or allergic inflammation is induced in response to inhaled allergens [431]. Their numbers and/or activation state appear to be crucial determinants of the development of an allergic response. Therefore, the persistence of DCs in the lung for weeks after the initial RSV infection could favor the development of allergic sensitization.",

Conversely, allergen sensitization and challenge preceding RSV infection can also result in markedly enhanced or prolonged AHR compared to RSV infection alone or allergen exposure alone [218, 247]. This can be associated with the further upregulation of allergen-induced Th2 cytokines, i.e., IL-4, IL-5, and particularly IL-13[433\u2013435], but this is not observed in all models [236] and there are even reports that RSV infection before sensitization significantly attenuated the AHR in response to allergen challenge [247] and prevented the allergen-induced upregulation of Th2 cytokines [434]. Whether RSV infection of mice also enhances allergen-specific IgE production has rarely been examined, but the available data suggest that it does not [219, 241] or actually suppresses allergen-specific IgE [434]. In contrast, bRSV-infected calves exhibited a greater increase in allergen-specific IgE after inhalation exposure to two different antigens, OVA and Alternaria, compared to mock-infected calves [436, 437].",

            "text": "The mechanisms implicated in the RSV-induced enhancement of allergen-induced AHR are equally variable. For example, one group of researchers showed that IL-5-dependent eosinophilia was essential for both virus-induced AHR and the enhancement of allergen-induced airway sensitization seen after RSV infection [219, 438]. Other investigators do not detect eosinophilia [115, 246] or even find decreased levels of IL-5 after RSV infection alone [209]. Instead, some data strongly implicate IL-13 and its ability to induce mucus production in both the RSV-associated AHR and the RSV-induced enhancement of allergic airway sensitization [116, 246]. While the results discussed so far suggest that that the two processes share a common mechanism, the results from another model indicate that the two events proceed via different mechanisms [209]. Specifically, through the use of IL-13-deficient mice or IL-13 neutralizing antibodies, it was demonstrated that IL-13 did not play a role in the AHR seen after RSV infection alone, even though it was strongly induced by RSV infection. It was, however an important mediator of the RSV-induced enhancement of allergic airway responses. In yet other experiments, RSV infection before allergen sensitization actually decreased the production of IL-13 and lung eosinophilia compared to OVA sensitization and challenge in mock-infected mice and thereby attenuated allergen-induced AHR [236, 247]. While some of these discrepancies can be attributed to methodological differences, it has been demonstrated that some commonly used laboratory strains of RSV do not induce pulmonary IL-13 production and upregulate IL-10 instead [114\u2013116]. Such viral strain-specific effects in combination with host susceptibility factors may account for some of the variability seen in human studies, with allergen sensitization and its effect on lung function depending in part on the viral strains predominating in the region and during the season that cohorts are recruited.",

            "text": "The findings in the Swedish cohort suggest a possible causal relationship between severe RSV bronchiolitis, allergic sensitization and atopic asthma [413\u2013416]. Remarkably, however, only two other controlled studies document a significantly increased frequency in allergic sensitization in subjects with early RSV bronchiolitis. In one case, this concerned sensitization to food allergens at the age of 1 year, while sensitization to inhaled allergens is a more important risk factor for the development of atopic asthma [407]. In a cohort that included children who had experienced RSV-positive or RSV-negative bronchiolitis in infancy, the rate of SPT positivity to common aeroallergens was significantly higher in index cases compared to controls (29 % of index cases vs. 15 % of controls) at the 5-year follow-up [409]. Note, however, that the frequency of wheezing did not differ between SPT-positive and -negative children, indicating that atopy was not a major factor in the high prevalence of wheezing observed in the bronchiolitis group. Various other cohorts do not show any evidence of significantly increased frequencies of atopy after severe RSV infection [439, 440]. Actually, in some studies, 6\u201310-year-old children with a history of hospitalization for RSV bronchiolitis in infancy were significantly less likely to show positive SPTs [420, 441]. Atopic manifestations (eczema and allergic rhinitis) also tended to be less common in one cohort [420], but the differences in both atopy and allergic symptoms had disappeared at the 9- to 10-year follow-up [417]. Several other investigations also found a lower rate of atopy in the RSV bronchiolitis compared to the control group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance [404] or was statistically significant in girls only [422]. Importantly, results from the prospectively followed COAST cohort yielded no evidence that wheezing during an acute viral respiratory infection was associated with an increased risk of allergen sensitization, regardless of viral etiology [427]. Even the group of researchers who first reported the detection of RSV-specific IgE and its association with postbronchiolitic wheezing did not find any association between RSV-IgE levels and the development of SPT positivity [442].",

This was only observed in children without a family history of atopy or food allergies, but not in those with such a family history [444]. This suggests that RSV LRTI may have differential effects on the development of recurrent wheezing depending on the genetic predisposition. This is consistent with the existence of several asthmatic or wheezing phenotypes during childhood, as proposed on the basis of observations in the Tuscon Children\u2019s Respiratory Study [445]. Early transient wheezing (at least 1 LRTI with wheezing during the first 3 years of life, but no wheezing at 6 years of age) was primarily associated with decreased lung function in infancy and maternal smoking during pregnancy or postnatal tobacco exposure. Persistent wheezing (at least one early LRTI with wheezing and wheezing at 6 years of age) was associated with elevated total serum IgE levels at 9 months of age, eczema, SPT positivity, maternal asthma, and male sex, whereas initial lung function was not a major risk factor. Late onset wheezing (no wheezing LRTI in early life, but wheezing at 6 years of age) was also associated with eczema, SPT positivity, maternal asthma, and male sex, but not with early elevations in total serum IgE levels or initial lung function.",

In a large case\u2013control study of Danish children <18 months of age recurrent wheezing and atopic dermatitis before the hospitalization as well as parental asthma were identified as independent risk factors for hospitalization due to RSV [83]. Similar results have been obtained in several smaller studies [74, 81, 446, 447], one of which further demonstrated a significant association between a family history of atopy and disease severity, as reflected in significantly longer hospitalization [447]. In marked contrast, a family history of eczema was strongly associated with protection from hospitalization due to RSV infection in a large Canadian cohort of prematurely born infants [76]. Others failed to identify atopy or atopic sensitization as a risk factor for RSV infection [82, 427, 448, 449], although it did increase the risk of LRTI due to rhinovirus [427, 448].",

            "text": "It is also possible that RSV does not increase the risk of asthma by promoting allergic sensitization, but by inducing a strong inflammatory response that would eventually become chronic and provoke bronchial hyperreactivity. Indeed, animal data suggest that the airway obstruction and particularly the AHR induced by RSV infection persist for weeks after the inoculation and at a period when the levels of inflammatory mediators in BAL fluid have returned to baseline [198, 199, 212]. This prolonged inflammation may be attributable to the persistence of low levels of viral genomic and messenger RNA in mouse lung tissue, which has been demonstrated to last for at least 77 days after inoculation [198, 212, 450]. Some data from studies in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease suggest that RSV also can persist in humans, but this remains controversial [451]. The potential effect of the RSV-induced upregulation of NGF also needs to be considered. The BAL fluid concentrations of this neurotrophin along with immunoreactivity for its receptor on bronchial ECs were found to be strongly increased in mechanically ventilated infants with severe RSV LRTI [329]. In rats, similar increases were observed and were particularly notable in young animals [452]. NGF is critical for the normal development of the nervous system in infancy. Heightened levels of this neurotrophin during a critical time frame of neuronal plasticity may result in irreversible changes in sensorineuronal pathways that may ultimately increase AHR and asthma susceptibility.",

            "text": "Subjects with severe RSV bronchiolitis during infancy frequently exhibit significantly reduced lung function compared to non-hospitalized controls [410, 415, 418, 420], although there are studies not showing such impairment [409, 422, 441]. In several cohorts, lung function was decreased to a similar extent in subjects with RSV-positive and -negative bronchiolitis [405, 418]. In contrast, others found significantly reduced lung function only in the RSV-negative group, but not in the RSV-positive group [422]. Similarly, among the participants of the COAST study, RSV wheezing illness during infancy or early childhood was not associated with decreased lung function at the age of 8 years, whereas lung function was significantly reduced in children with rhinovirus wheezing illness in the first 3 years of life compared to those with non-wheezing rhinovirus illness or non-rhinovirus illnesses [453]. In the few studies with such extended follow-up, lung function impairment after severe RSV bronchiolitis in infancy was found to persist into early adulthood [416, 440]. Indications of airway obstruction are quite consistently observed, including reductions in peak expiratory flow, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), the ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity (FVC), maximum expiratory flow at 75, 50, and 25 % of vital capacity. In contrast, signs of airway restriction are detected only in some studies [420, 454], while FVC is unaffected in the majority of cohorts [410, 417, 418]. Like Sigurs et al. [415, 416], other investigators report significantly increased AHR in subject with RSV bronchiolitis in early childhood [410, 420\u2013422], an exception being the study of young adults examined 20 years after the acute RSV bronchiolitis [440].",

Unfortunately, the findings are difficult to compare because of the numerous different techniques used to measure premorbid lung function and the different ages at which testing took place. In addition, the aspect of early lung function that is decreased in the early neonatal period may differ between boys and girls [458] and may reach significance in one sex only [457]. Importantly, these differences in lung function between those who developed LRTI and those who did not were found to persist until the age of 10 or 11 years [456, 457], but there was no significant effect of type or frequency of early LRTI once lung function at birth was taken into account [457]. In addition, decreased neonatal function was also associated with recurrent wheezing after acute respiratory infections, particularly in those who experienced more than one episode of wheezing LRTI [460]. Finally, decrements in neonatal lung function track into adulthood [461\u2013463], and there are numerous data suggesting that they contribute to the development of asthma [464, 465]. In another investigation of infants born to mothers with a history of physician-diagnosed asthma, neonatal AHR rather than lung function per se was significantly associated with the development of severe bronchiolitis and the development of asthma at the age of 7 years [466]. Together, these results suggest that a common host factor affects not only lung function development in utero, but also susceptibility to AHR, LRTI during early childhood, postbronchiolitic wheezing and the development of asthma. By extension, this would mean that bronchiolitis is a first manifestation of asthma.",

Such a \u201cdose\u2013response\u201d relationship between bronchiolitis in infancy and childhood asthma suggests a causal relationship. The same group of authors claim to have provided further evidence for a causal association by showing that the highest odds ratio of developing clinically significant bronchiolitis was seen in children who were 122 days old, and the highest risk of being diagnosed with high-risk childhood asthma was observed in children who were 121 days old, at the time of the winter virus peak [469]. In contrast, age at the time of their first medical visit for bronchiolitis was not associated with asthma risk. As Kuehni and Silverman [470] so aptly comment: \u201cIf we hypothesize that \u2026 bronchiolitis confers developmental damage, this should happen when the child is ill but not when other children are ill.\u201d Note that the viral etiology of the bronchiolitis episodes was not ascertained in these studies; therefore the contribution of RSV to the increased asthma risk cannot be determined.",

On the one hand, ICU admission as a measure of disease severity was the only significant predictor of postbronchiolitic wheezing and hospital admission for asthma in the first year after hospitalization for either RSV or influenza-associated LRTI [411]. In contrast, none of the factors reflecting the severity of the initial RSV bronchiolitis episode, which required hospital care, were significantly associated with physician-diagnosed asthma in another cohort [471]. Monozygotic twin pairs discordant for RSV hospitalization in infancy (and, it is assumed, disease severity) were not found to differ in lung function, AHR, frequency of asthma diagnosis, or allergic sensitization at a mean age of 7.6 years [472]. In addition, when asked which of the twins had the more severe disease, the parents identified the non-hospitalized twin with similar frequency as the hospitalized twin. In other cases, both twins may have been hospitalized in the expectation that their disease would eventually be of similar severity, even though one may have been less severely affected. In a study of the association between RSV hospitalization and asthma in the same 5,154 Danish twin pairs that formed the patient basis for the preceding study, modeling of the direction of causation indicated that severe RSV infection did not cause asthma, but instead was an early indicator of a shared genetic predisposition for both asthma and severe RSV disease [473].",

It should be noted, however, that the alleles or genotypes showing an association with asthma or asthmatic phenotypes in one population may be protective in another population or not show any association [474], as has also been observed for associations with severe RSV infection. Therefore, only studies comparing the genetic associations with asthma and severe RSV disease in genetically rather homogeneous populations are likely to yield meaningful results. Such studies do not suggest that there is considerable overlap in the genetic susceptibility to asthma and severe RSV infection. For example, the promoter SNP \u2212781 C/T in the IL8 gene was associated with asthma at the genotype level, but showed no association with severe RSV disease [384]. The haplotype distribution of 3 surfactant protein (SP)-B SNPs was significantly associated with severe RSV disease, but not with asthma [373]. Statistically highly significant differences between asthma patients and RSV patients were also observed in the haplotype distribution for SP-C, with the 138Thr-186Asn haplotype being overrepresented in RSV cases, but not in asthma patients [374].",

While IL-10 concentrations in NPS of acutely RSV-infected infants were significantly associated with the later development of postbronchiolitic wheezing, the \u2212592 C/A SNP in the promoter region of the IL10 gene did not significantly influence the risk of recurrent wheezing [392]. The GA genotype of the \u2212403 G/A polymorphism in the promoter region of the RANTES gene was found to be associated with recurrent wheezing in a Chinese cohort [376]. This SNP showed no association with hospitalization for RSV bronchiolitis in this cohort, similar to what has been reported for a Greek cohort [378], whereas the A allele was protective in a Japanese population [377]. In a British cohort, TDT showed the \u2212251A allele to be transmitted more frequently to children who wheezed after RSV bronchiolitis compared to those who did not, and this association was confirmed in a case\u2013control study [475]. This allele was also a risk factor for hospitalization due to RSV bronchiolitis in a study from the same area, [380, 381], whereas the T allele conferred this risk in a Chinese population [383], and no association was detected in German infants [384]. Note that, in the same German cohort, the \u2212251 T allele was associated with asthma [384, 476]. Another SNP that has been implicated in asthma susceptibility, the A38G polymorphism in the Clara cell protein 10, did not show any association with wheezing after RSV bronchiolitis [403].",

Histologic findings in postmortem tissue were reported to include some excess in eosinophils. It was subsequently hypothesized that the relatively better preservation of the G compared to the F protein induced a Th2 polarization and pulmonary eosinophilia, as has been observed in BALB/c mice that were challenged with RSV after immunization with FI-RSV, recombinant vaccinia virus encoding the G protein or purified G protein [477], although other data suggest upregulation of IL-10, but not of IL-4 and IL-5 [400]. However, the development of eosinophilia after G protein priming depends on the MHC haplotype in mice, and is not a feature of vaccine-enhanced disease in cotton rats [293], or bRSV-infected calves [478]. The full autopsy report apparently emphasized the predominance of neutrophils and mononuclear cells in the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium, and these findings were confirmed in a second analysis of the original postmortem tissue [293]. Most importantly, eosinophils constituted 1\u20132 % of the inflammatory infiltrate. In addition, it has been shown that the G protein is not necessary in order to induce vaccine-enhanced disease [477]. Instead, the production of large amounts of non-neutralizing antibodies due to either disruption of critical epitopes or poor TLR stimulation [258] has been shown to result in the formation and tissue deposition of immune complexes [477].",

There are, however, a variety of other issues that greatly impede the generation of a safe and effective RSV vaccine [479, 480]. Since RSV infects infants at a very young age and a vaccine would have to be administered at or soon after birth, these factors include (1) the immaturity of the cellular and humoral immune system in infants, (2) the presence of maternally derived antibodies, which are known to suppress the development of serum and mucosal antibody responses, (3) the necessity to test vaccine preparations in older subjects who have already developed RSV-specific memory and are, therefore, likely to respond differently to vaccines compared to RSV-naive infants. In addition, neonates routinely receive a battery of immunizations already, and it needs to be ensured that RSV vaccines do not interfere with the efficacy of these other vaccines, and vice versa.",

Sera from vaccinated calves with and without exacerbation were examined by Western blot against BRSV and probed with both anti-IgG and anti-IgE. Serum from calves in the vaccine exacerbated group had IgE specific for BRSV proteins after the second booster vaccine and these responses became greater after infection. In contrast, serum from calves that did not show disease exacerbation had strong IgG bands and no IgE responses [481].

In addition, a variety of adjuvants are being examined for their ability to enhance the immunogenicity of the various preparations and to prevent vaccine-enhanced disease via Th2-skewing [181, 254, 485]. These adjuvants increasingly include CpG oligonucleotides and other TLR ligands [488] and, with the appropriate adjuvants, even formalin-inactivated preparations do not induce Th2 cytokines [181, 489]. Note that recombinant RSV vaccines are commonly derived from the RSV A2 laboratory strain. This approach may have to be reconsidered in light of evidence that recent clinical isolates differ markedly from this prototype in terms of cytopathology, replication kinetics and induction of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines in primary bronchial ECs [117].",

Some are retrospective and therefore based on parental recall several years after [405] or limited to review of the medical records [408]. Some of the prospective studies suffer from enormous loss to follow-up [409, 442]. Many of the publications do not provide sufficient details on the definitions of wheezing and asthma and the methods for eliciting information on their frequency from the parents. End-points are therefore highly inconsistent from study to study. Perhaps more importantly, almost all of the studies focus on a single episode of RSV infection without considering that most infants experience several episodes of acute respiratory infections, often including more than one LRTI [17, 41, 104, 426]. In addition, infants who had a RSV-associated LRTI seem prone to experience further episodes of LRTI, including episodes severe enough to require hospitalization [406, 491]. Furthermore, the number of wheezy LRTIs has been found to increase the risk of childhood asthma [428, 492], and such other wheezy LRTIs frequently are associated with rhinovirus, which has been shown to be a stronger risk factor for the development of asthma than is RSV, at least in high-risk children [426, 428].",

Hence, failure to consider LRTI following the index (hospitalization for) RSV bronchiolitis raises the question of whether the observed association with childhood asthma is truly attributable to the original RSV infection. The COAST study in Madison, WI, is a notable exception because it prospectively collected data on all moderate to severe acute respiratory illnesses during the first 3 years of life and analyzed the association between rhinovirus- and RSV-associated episodes and the subsequent development of asthma while adjusting for the occurrence of respiratory illnesses due to the other agent [426].",

Therefore, if disease severity has an impact on the later development of recurrent wheezing or asthma, as has been reported for bronchiolitis episodes of any etiology [468], co-infections may be one of the factors influencing the development of recurrent wheezing and asthma. Clearly, more research is needed to elucidate the relationship between RSV bronchiolitis, other viral induced LRTI and asthma.",
