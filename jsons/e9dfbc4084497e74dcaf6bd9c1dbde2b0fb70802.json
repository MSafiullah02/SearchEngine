Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), lung failure, and fulminant pneumonia are major lung diseases in H7N9 patients. Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a promising choice for treating virus-induced pneumonia, and was used to treat H7N9-induced ARDS in 2013. The transplant of MSCs into patients with H7N9-induced ARDS was conducted at a single center through an open-label clinical trial. Based on the principles of voluntariness and informed consent, 44 patients with H7N9-induced ARDS were included as a control group, while 17 patients with H7N9induced ARDS acted as an experimental group with allogeneic menstrual-blood-derived MSCs. It was notable that MSC transplantation significantly lowered the mortality of the experimental group, compared with the control group (17.6% died in the experimental group while 54.5% died in the control group). Furthermore, MSC transplantation did not result in harmful effects in the bodies of four of the patients who were part of the five-year follow-up period. Collectively, these results suggest that MSCs significantly improve the survival rate of H7N9-induced ARDS and provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of H7N9-induced ARDS in both preclinical research and clinical studies. Because H7N9 and the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) share similar complications (e.g., ARDS and lung failure) and corresponding multi-organ dysfunction, MSC-based therapy could be a possible alternative for treating COVID-19.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are divided into multiple subtypes according to diversified viral surface antigens and two major pathotypes, including high and low pathogenicity for chicken [1, 2] .

A novel avian-original influenza virus emerged in the spring of 2013 and unfortunately led to severe and fatal respiratory disease in humans [4] .

H7N9 viruses are able to spread between mammalian hosts (ferrets) without losing virulence [10] , and genetic mutations of H7N9 virus confer the risk of human-to-human transmission [11] [12] [13] , as demonstrated in a few family clusters infected by this virus [14, 15] .

The death rate of the control group was 54.5%, while the death rate of the experimental group was 17.6%. No cases of pulmonary embolism occurred in any of the patients. These findings indicate that MSC therapy is a safe and effective treatment for patients with severe lung disease induced by H7N9. There is also no evidence for MSC-associated long-term adverse events in our study. Zheng et al. [39] recently concluded that 12 patients with moderate to severe ARDS developed no infusion toxicities or MSC-related serious adverse events.

However, no further significant differences were observed in the interstitial fibrosis and groundglass opacities after the one-year follow-up [42] . These characteristics are consistent with those of survivors suffering from H7N9 infection in the current clinical trial. In this investigation, it was found that when the patients returned home, they not only lacked basic activity, but were usually isolated from their relatives and neighbors because people were afraid of being infected with H7N9. After all, hundreds of people died from H7N9 in 2013. These survivors have obviously lower HRQoL than the normal population, which may have been a result of deficiencies in social function and mental health. Moreover, a meta-analysis indicated that ARDS survivors can improve the function of HRQoL during the initial six months after discharge from hospital [45] . These reports indicated that the quality of life of ARDS survivors infected with IAVs is rather worse than of people with no history of IAVs infection.

With only 17 patients using MSC, we cannot guarantee that every step was perfect during our phase with only a one -time clinical trial. Second, we should state that this was not a routine clinical trial, owing to the H7N9 outbreak and to the lack of better options to treat patients with severe ARDS. Therefore, the patients did not want further visits; some patients refused to attend, and some did not complete follow-up. Thus, we are still concerned about the long-term safety of MSC transplantation for treating H7N9-induced ARDS, despite the lack of side effects observed in this clinical trial. Moreover, although some H7N9 patients may have had a potential lung infection, most were receiving other drugs without further examination, and it was not possible to obtain an ideal comparison of lung functional indicators between the experimental group and the control group.

Although MSC has shown great promise in the treatment of some immunological diseases (especially graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)), the variabilities of MSC quality from different donors and tissues is wide, and treatment protocols, doses, and injection modes are inconsistent during experimental procedures [53] .
