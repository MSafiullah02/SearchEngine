Data from the COVID-19 data repository of the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering, the European center for disease control and prevention, and the World Health Organization were used to obtain the daily number of cases and organize incidence data. Disease spread was assessed using the reproduction number of the disease across the sampled countries. R statistical software's R0 package was used to estimate the reproduction number of the COVID19 using the exponential growth method. After computing the reproductive number of each country in the study, a multiple linear regression model was fitted using R0 value as dependent variable, and latitude and population density as an independent variable. Disease severity was analyzed using the case fatality ratio of COVID-19. The proportion of deaths were meta-analyzed using the R statistical software's metaphor package, using random effect inverse variance weighting to come up with the case fatality ratio.",

The relative frequency of people above 65 years old was positively correlated with the cumulative numbers of COVID-19 cases as well as case fatality ratio in each country. The multiple linear regression model fitted between CFR and the three major covariates showed that, the demographic distribution of the sampled countries is strongly associated with the case fatality ratio. Correlation with proportion of populations over 65 years old is concordant with the previous findings relationship between case fatality ratio and patient age.",

As of May 15, 2020 On Jan 30, 2020, WHO declared the current novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. [2] All continents have reported confirmed cases of COVID-19. Africa confirmed its first case in Egypt on Feb 14, 2020 . An initial assessment of the outbreak by Li and colleagues estimated that in the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days and the basic reproductive number (R0) was 2.2. [3] It has been challenging to accurately track the spread, because of factors such as the lack of rapid diagnostic tests and the mildness of the symptoms in some infected people. SARS-CoV-2 shares 88% sequence identity to two coronaviruses found in bats, bat-SLCoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, 79% identity with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and 50% identity with Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. [4] The case fatality ratio (CFR) for cases outside China was initially estimated to be 2.2% (95% confidence interval, 0.6%-5.8%). [5] A recent study of the symptomatic case fatality risk (the probability of dying from the infection after developing symptoms) in Wuhan found that the overall risk was 1.4% in patients aged 15 years or older. [6] The virus has rapidly spread worldwide, and future scenarios remain highly uncertain. Modelling by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team in London predicted approximately 510,000 deaths in Great Britain and 2.2 million in the US, not accounting for the potential negative effects of health systems being overwhelmed on mortality. [7] This is argued as a worst-case scenario, which even if true would be mitigated by the many people who would be minimally or mildly symptomatic.",

The pooled overall estimate of the case fatality (weighted average) among the sampled countries is lower than the arithmetic mean of CFR (4.62 and 3.86 for the arithmetic mean and pooled estimate respectively) and this can be explained by the high heterogeneity between the studied countries. As it is illustrated on figure ) , the 50 countries covered in this study has exhibited a noticeable difference in the case fatality ratio, ranging from 15% in Belgium to less than 1% in some African countries. The multiple linear regression model fitted between CFR and the three major covariates showed that, the demographic distribution of the sampled countries is strongly associated with the case fatality ratio. Countries that have a very high proportion of elderly population (proportion of population above 65 years of age) were found to have a higher case fatality rate. An increase in the elderly population proportion by 1% was associated with an increase in CFR by 0.32. .

Parameters of the COVID-19 pandemic that we have analyzed herein are important for predicting the spread and managing the ongoing outbreak. Particularly, cross-country comparisons of CFR and RR as important indicators of disease spread and severity are vital for setting priority for public health response and monitoring health system capacity and performance. Nevertheless, the magnitude of undetected cases or the length of delay in case reporting can significantly affect CFR and RR and can confound the estimations.",

A similar behavior has been observed for other SARS coronaviruses that belong to the same Coronaviridae family of SARS-CoV-2. [26 -27] Our study included data from a range of countries and climatic regions. Our regression model analysis that accounted for age, population density and latitude showed that age distribution remains an important driver shaping the current distribution of COVID-19 cases. The relative frequency of people \u2265 65 years old was positively correlated with the cumulative numbers of COVID-19 cases as well as case fatality ratio in each country. Correlation with proportion of populations over 65 years old is concordant with the previous findings relationship between case fatality ratio and patient age. [9] In other previous studies environmental factors that influence the relationship between temperature and mortality, such as latitude, humidity, and sociodemographic factors have been reported. [28 -30] We found no significant association for the parameters analyzed with population density. Previously spotted correlation of population density with virus spread and mortality requires further investigation before concluding that there is a correlation. We also examined possible association of incidence and mortality with country centroid latitude. Although human mobility and host susceptibility were main drivers in the spread of COVID-19, the potential role of latitude as a factor of COVID-19 burden was not further supported by our finding regarding latitude which did not suggest any protective effect of tropical climates. However, other studies analysis suggests that hemisphere might influence mortality (the latter seems to be higher in the Northern Hemisphere, p = 0.036) and thus does not contradict the .
