Pulmonary infections have various etiologies and have variegated patterns on radiographs and computed tomography (CT). Imaging plays an important role in the initial diagnosis and follow-up of various lung infections. Radiographs can be normal or non-specific during the initial evaluation, and CT findings may be more definitive. CT not only helps with the diagnosis but can also aid in management by guiding the diagnostic and therapeutic procedure. The pulmonary infections spread by direct or indirect contact with the infected host, droplet transmission, or an airborne spread. In rare cases, some infections can also be transmitted by vectors, namely, insect or animal hosts, and rarely by direct invasion from nearby infected organs. Pulmonary infections may have typical imaging patterns and distribution based on the mode of spread. There are a number of well-described imaging patterns of alveolar infections. The localization and morphological features on imaging may help in the diagnosis of infection and identification of mode of infection and, in certain cases, the microorganism responsible for the infection.",

            "text": "Consolidation is a typical pattern of a lung infection on a radiograph of the chest, usually initiating as a small focus close to the fissures. Pneumonia can be caused by a variety of organisms like bacteria, bacteria-like organisms like Mycoplasma pneumonia, fungi, or even a number of viruses. Lobar pneumonia and bronchopneumonia are two distinct patterns of pulmonary infections (Figs. 6.1 and 6.2). Lobar pneumonia results in a homogenous opacity, limited by the fissures and without any associated volume loss. There may be the presence of \u201cair bronchograms\u201d that result from relative sparing of the bronchi, appearing as dark air-filled linear spaces within the exudate-filled alveoli. Lobar pneumonia usually has surrounding ground-glass opacities, better seen on computed tomography (CT), and can have associated complications like an abscess, pleural effusion, or empyema. The opacification of an entire lobe is uncommon nowadays due to early antibiotic treatment, which stops the progress of the infective process. Some cases of lobar pneumonia have typical imaging patterns (Table 6.1) (Fig. 6.3) [2, 3]. However, one should remember that consolidation is not diagnostic of infection and can also be seen in other conditions like pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, organizing pneumonia, vasculitis, and even malignancies.\n\n\n\n",

This pattern of infection is seen in children due to lack of development of interalveolar connections and collateral airways. Typically, occurring as a solitary lesion, these are usually due to bacterial infection, most commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumonia. Round pneumonia can be seen on a chest radiograph as rounded nodular opacity with ill-defined margins, commonly involving the superior segments of the lower lobes.

The early airways and peribronchial ground-glass densities spread and become confluent resulting in consolidation (Fig. 6.2). The involvement eventually spread to larger areas, involving the segment or the entire lobe. The most common causes of bronchopneumonia include Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, some fungi, and anaerobes. The appearance of bronchopneumonia on radiograph depends upon the stage and may range from multifocal ground-glass opacities to consolidations. The opacities are usually asymmetric in distribution and may predominantly involve the lung bases. The pattern is better appreciated on computed tomography (CT) scans. Usual CT features include focal bronchial wall thickening, centrilobular nodularity, and multifocal opacities around the bronchioles, which can also be associated with tree-in-bud appearance [5]. With the progression of infection, the ground-glass opacities lead to confluent areas of consolidation, and in most of the cases, CT shows scattered foci of the combination of two opacities.",

This is due to cellular infiltrate in the alveolar septa and the peribronchovascular interstitium with resultant peribronchial and interlobular septal thickening or due to partial filling of airspaces in the lungs by exudate or transudate [1]. Predominant ground-glass opacification is usually seen in atypical pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumonia and viral infections, particularly the opportunistic infections in an immunocompromised host [7]. These include Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP), cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia, and herpes simplex virus (HSV) pneumonia. There are many other causes for ground-glass opacities, in immunocompromised hosts (Table 6.2).\n",

Cavitation is frequently seen in nosocomial infections and in immunocompromised hosts [9]. Some common causes of infective nodules include tuberculosis, nocardiosis, angioinvasive aspergillosis, cryptococcal infection, and atypical mycobacterial infection [1]. Miliary pattern, i.e., diffuse nodules less than 3 mm, can be seen in a number of infections. Septic pulmonary embolism should always be considered in cases of cavitary pulmonary nodules (Fig. 6.4). This condition results from embolization of infectious particles in the lungs, which block the peripheral pulmonary artery divisions, resulting in infarction and necrosis of the lung parenchyma. Common sources of septic emboli include infectious tricuspid endocarditis (especially in intravenous drug abusers), peripheral thrombophlebitis, infected central line, and cardiac pacemaker [10]. Although not a reliable sign, feeding vessels leading to the cavitary nodule can be demonstrated on CT images [11]. Ground-glass changes surrounding lung nodules can also be due to surrounding hemorrhage and have been described in viral infections, atypical mycobacterial infection, and candida infection [12, 13, 14]. Nodules with surrounding ground-glass changes and subpleural wedge-shaped opacities are highly suggestive of angioinvasive aspergillosis, in a context of severe neutropenia.\n",

The parenchymal focus called \u201cGhon focus\u201d usually resolves without any sequel on chest radiograph or less commonly heals by calcification or calcified granuloma [15, 16]. In a small number of cases, the infection progresses with enlargement of the parenchymal lesion and spread of infection along the lymphatics in the mediastinal lymph nodes. Majority of the cases of childhood primary tuberculosis in the endemic zones have dominant lymphadenopathy, a finding less commonly seen in adults. \u201cRanke complex\u201d is suggestive of previous tuberculous infection and compromises of Ghon focus with calcification in the hilar node. Pleural involvement is seen in few cases, usually the same side as the parenchymal disease [17].

Most cases involve more than one segment, in many cases even showing bilateral disease. Cavitation may be present in almost up to 50% of cases of post-primary tuberculosis. The endobronchial spread of the disease occurs when the caseous necrosis liquefaction communicates with the bronchial tree, resulting in nodular lesions distant to the cavity. This results in classical \u201ctree-in-bud\u201d opacities on CT scan, compromising of tiny centrilobular nodules, and branching linear opacities [19]. Tuberculoma can be solitary or multiple, round, oval, or elongated nodules and appear hyperdense or demonstrate frank areas of peripheral calcification. Pleural disease and chest wall involvement are less common and seen only in a minority of the cases.\n",

Nontuberculous mycobacterial infections can also be seen in non-HIV immunocompromised cases, like patients on chemotherapy, post-organ transplantation, and long-term steroids and patients with lymphoma or leukemia [27, 28]. Radiographic findings are limited to reticulonodular opacities, cavities, and lymphadenopathy.

It can also be seen in other cavity-forming conditions or less commonly in cystic bronchiectasis [2]. ABPA is a type of eosinophilic lung disease, usually seen in patients with long-standing asthma, cystic fibrosis, or Kartagener\u2019s syndrome. The disease has various clinical stages from acute stage to end-stage fibrosis, patients usually presenting with asthma-like presentation with a recurrent lung infection. Imaging features are included in the major diagnostic criteria of ABPA. Invasive aspergillosis is the commonest fungal infection involving the lungs [30], typically seen in immunocompromised patients with neutropenia. Angioinvasive aspergillosis is seen in severely immunocompromised patients (graft-versus-host disease following bone marrow transplant, late stages of AIDS, long-term corticosteroids, prolonged severe neutropenia). Clinical features are not reliable and early imaging is the key to identifying the pulmonary lesions. The diagnosis is confirmed only by histopathology evaluation. Mortality rates due to invasive aspergillosis can be as high as up to 70% [30]. Chronic aspergillosis is seen in patients with background chronic lung disease or diabetes and can present in cavitary or fibrosing forms [36, 37].",

These features include consolidation, small nodules with tree-in-bud opacities, cavitating nodules, enlarged lymph nodes, and pleural effusion. Diagnosis is confirmed by identifying the organisms in bronchoalveolar lavage, in sputum, or by monoclonal antibody testing.

Clinical presentations of most of these infections are similar, and the diagnosis is heavily reliant on the background picture, risk factors, and exposures [7]. Imaging is useful in identifying the pattern and extent of the disease, assessing response on follow-up and for diagnostic procedures. Chest radiographs are unremarkable or may demonstrate non-specific changes, like patchy ground-glass opacities, consolidations, effusion, or nodules. Although imaging features in bacterial and viral pulmonary infections show considerable overlap, CT may be useful by demonstrating few main patterns of disease (Table 6.12) [39]. Some viral infections are more common in specific scenarios with a particular imaging pattern. Ground-glass opacities, multiple nodules, or \u201cinterstitial pneumonia\u201d pattern in a patient with hematopoietic stem cell transplant is most commonly seen in cytomegalovirus infection.\n",

Mendelson syndrome is a form of acute chemical pneumonitis due to aspiration of acidic gastric content during general anesthesia usually for obstetric procedures. Imaging features are similar to noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. When aspiration occurs in a recumbent patient, the changes are seen involving the posterior segment of the upper lobes and the superior segment or posterior basal segments of lower lobes (Figs. 6.1, 6.24, 6.25, 6.26, and 6.27) (Table 6.13). Bilateral basal, lingula, and middle lobe involvement can be seen in otherwise ambulatory patients. Chronic/recurrent aspiration pneumonitis usually appears as small and large airways disease but may mimic fibrotic lung disease or even a lung mass.
