In such outbreaks, instead of serving as points where disease was controlled, health-care facilities became dangerous places for outbreak amplification among staff and patients and transmission back to communities. According to WHO, defective IPC practices during everyday health-care delivery also cause harm to hundreds of millions of patients worldwide every year.1, 2 The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control estimated that more than 2\u00b76 million new cases of health-care-associated infection occur every year in Europe, with a cumulative burden estimated in disability-adjusted-life-years that is higher than all other reported 32 communicable diseases.3 The burden of health-care-associated infections was also recently highlighted in southeast Asian countries.4 Many health systems fail to build strong foundations to reduce the risks and spread of health-care-associated outbreaks. They also tolerate an unacceptably poor level of IPC in everyday practice.",

Inevitably, the pace at which change can be achieved in countries will vary for historical, logistical, and financial reasons.

While efforts such as new drug development are certainly needed, IPC is a tried-and-true approach that is likely to be cost-effective and with the capacity to sustain or even potentiate successes gained through new drug development or improving antibiotic use.",
