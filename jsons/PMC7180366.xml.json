During this health care crisis it is important to weigh the risk of contamination related to breaking lockdown for treatment delivery against the risk of jeopardizing cancer prognosis by delaying any form of treatment. This consideration is of utmost relevance for patients with high-risk non\u2013muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) who require repeat visits to hospital for intravesical instillations of bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) to decrease the risk of recurrence and progression after transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB). The median age at initial diagnosis in this patient population is >70 yr [1] and it has recently been reported that almost 30% of patients older than 65 yr may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome after contracting COVID-19 [2]. Therefore, most NMIBC patients should be considered at high risk of presenting with severe forms of COVID-19 that might require admission to an intensive care unit for invasive ventilation.",

This could be associated with both more adverse side effects of BCG and/or more severe forms of COVID-19.

This is based on the epidemiological observation that older patients are at higher risk of COVID-19, especially severe forms, while younger patients could be protected by BCG vaccination providing childhood immunity that may last for approximately 20 yr [8]. In addition, preclinical studies in mice have shown that BCG vaccination could offer protection against various DNA and RNA viruses via induction of innate immune memory and heterologous lymphocyte activation [9]. Two randomized controlled trials are currently testing BCG vaccination for COVID-19 prevention in Australia (NCT04327206) and the Netherlands (NCT04328441). Arguably, intravesical instillations of BCG for induction of a local immune response with activation of macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer T lymphocytes [10] could help in preventing and/or controlling COVID-19, but this is only a hypothesis that cannot currently be used for clinical decision-making. Only post-crisis retrospective analyses of COVID-19 incidence among NMIBC patients treated with intravesical instillations of BCG during the pandemic will provide interesting insights into this view.",
