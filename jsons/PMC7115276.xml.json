Guidance for intensive care unit capacity has been published, ranging from a 20%-300% increase in bed numbers, depending on the type of incident.5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14 One option to meet capacity needs would be to implement a temporary negative-pressure isolation ward that could house a large number of patients. To date, there are few studies detailing the effectiveness of temporary isolation wards to be used during a surge. Rosenbaum et al demonstrated during a hospital disaster preparedness drill that multiple high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)\u2013filtered negative air machines placed in a physical therapy gymnasium produced the recommended pressure and AER for negative-pressure isolation.15 In another demonstration, a 3-unit temporary patient shelter was constructed out of plastic sheeting and ventilated using negative-air machines.16 Containment was estimated using fluorescent tracer particles, and very high levels of containment were achieved (>99%) with AERs of 15 ACHs.",

As expected, an overall reduction in supply flows was observed during the negative-pressure demonstration, but there was significant room-to-room variability. This variability resulted in 2 rooms within the ward (bedroom 1 and UTL) becoming neutrally or positively pressurized during the demonstration. In bedroom 1, the difference between the supply and return flow decreased from 186 to 89 m3/h during the pretest and demonstration phases, respectively. Interestingly, room-to-room variability in ventilation flow changes was not limited to supply flow changes, but often return flows increased and exhaust flows decreased when negative pressure was implemented. Despite our findings that airflow reversals were rarely encountered, they are possible, even when pressure gradients far exceed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines (as seen on the ward in bedroom 1 and UTL). Therefore, it is prudent for HCWs and visitors to wear airborne precautions (eg, N95 respirator) while residing on these wards, whether in patient rooms or common areas.",

Temporary patient housing options and gymnasiums also do not typically provide amenities found in hospital bedrooms, such as oxygen supply lines, various medical devices and equipment, and a bathroom with a toilet and shower. Because of these limitations, using existing hospital spaces and ventilation systems to establish a surge ward could be an improvement on previous negative-pressure isolation ward designs. Supplemental methods to increase surge capacity, such as reverse triage,29 reducing nonurgent hospital admissions,12 and delaying certain types of surgery,30 could provide the room availability needed to establish a surge ward in a functioning hospital.",

Close collaboration and cooperation involved numerous departments and disciplines, including infection control and prevention, nursing and hospice services, occupational health, environmental agents service, safety services, medical center leadership, and engineering services. The engineering and hospital infection control departments helped design the temporary ward plan, and input from nursing leadership on the ward was vital for determining what would be possible during the surge demonstration. Hospital leadership was briefed with the full plan in the weeks prior to the demonstration. When conducting such a project at a functioning hospital, it is essential to balance the needs of the patients, needs of the hospital staff, and requirements for a successful demonstration.",

Even though air pressure differentials well exceeded Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, airflow reversals still occurred. These reversals only occurred within the ward and not between the hall anteroom and the rest of the hospital, therefore still containing a possible outbreak. Accordingly, it is prudent for health care personnel to wear PPE when working on temporary negative-pressure isolation wards.",
