            "text": "Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63, NL63) was first described in 2004 in the Netherlands (van der Hoek et al., 2004). However, it was already isolated in 1988 (Fouchier et al., 2004), or even earlier (van der Hoek et al., 2006). NL63 has since been reported in more than 15 countries across the world and accounts for up to 9.3% of acute respiratory infections leading to hospitalization (Albuquerque et al., 2009, Arden et al., 2005, Bastien et al., 2005, Chiu et al., 2005, Dare et al., 2007, Ebihara et al., 2005, Esper et al., 2005, Gerna et al., 2006, Han et al., 2007, Koetz et al., 2006, Moes et al., 2005, Oosterhof et al., 2009, Smuts et al., 2008, Vabret et al., 2005). These findings suggest that NL63 has been widely circulating in the human population for decades. NL63 infection generally causes mild upper respiratory tract diseases, but may also cause more severe lower respiratory tract diseases, e.g. croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia in young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised people (van der Hoek et al., 2006). No vaccine or antiviral drug is currently available for NL63.",

S protein is anchored on the viral envelope, a lipid bilayer derived from the intracellular membrane during virus budding. S protein is a type I transmembrane protein containing a signal peptide, long N-terminal ectodomain, transmembrane (TM) domain, and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 1). The signal peptide directs the nascent S polypeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the signal peptide is cleaved and monomeric precursors are synthesized. The precursors are heavily glycosylated to yield 150\u2013200 kDa mature monomers, which are further oligomerized into trimers within the ER (Masters, 2006). S trimers interact with M protein through their cytoplasmic tails and are transported to the ER\u2013Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) where assembly and budding occur (Hogue and Machamer, 2008). This is in contrast to the assembly and budding of many enveloped viruses, e.g. HIV, that occur on the plasma membrane (Chen and Lamb, 2008).",

As such, the particular S1\u2013receptor interaction largely determines the host range, tissue and cell tropisms of coronaviruses. In addition, S1 is the major determinant for eliciting neutralizing antibody, which in turn blocks virion\u2013receptor binding and protects animals from infection (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001, Wentworth and Holmes, 2007). Many coronaviruses have variations in S1 that evade immune response. Amazingly, variations as small as one amino acid have been shown to change receptor usage, tissue tropism and pathogenesis (Ballesteros et al., 1997, Krempl et al., 2000). The S2 domain mediates membrane fusion during viral entry into host cells. It contains several conserved regions characteristic of class I viral fusion proteins: fusion peptide (FP), two heptad repeats (HRs), TM domain and several conserved cysteine residues in the cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 1). Each of these structural features has been shown to contribute to membrane fusion (Wentworth and Holmes, 2007).",

Although they use the same receptor for entry, these two viruses cause different clinical outcomes. In contrast to NL63 that generally causes mild respiratory diseases, such as croup in children (van der Hoek et al., 2005, Wu et al., 2008, Sung et al., 2010), SARS-CoV is highly pathogenic and is characterized by acute lung failure with high mortality (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003, WHO, 2004).",

            "text": "This contrast has generated wide interest in comparing the roles of S proteins of these two viruses in hACE2 binding and entry. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) has been mapped to amino acid residues 318\u2013510 for SARS-CoV (Wong et al., 2004), and 476\u2013616 for NL63 (Li et al., 2007, Lin et al., 2008). The RBDs of these two viruses bind to a largely overlapping region of hACE2 (Li et al., 2007), although the receptor-binding affinity of NL63 S is much less compared with SARS-CoV S (Lin et al., 2008, Mathewson et al., 2008). In addition, SARS-CoV S and NL63 S may cause differential downregulation of hACE2 level by induced shedding of its ectodomain from the cell surface (Haga et al., 2008, Glowacka et al., 2010). Downregulation of hACE2 is considered to be a leading cause of acute lung failure (Imai et al., 2005, Kuba et al., 2005). Finally, SARS-CoV S, but not NL63 S, is cleaved by endosomal cathepsin L, and such proteolytic cleavage is important for SARS-CoV entry (Huang et al., 2006). It should be mentioned that these studies were greatly facilitated by the utilization of lentivirus- or VSV-based pseudotype virus bearing coronaviral S proteins. These S-mediated pseudotype viruses have identical cell tropisms to the authentic coronaviruses, and their entry is also solely dependent on cellular receptors (Broer et al., 2006, Fukushi et al., 2005, Giroglou et al., 2004, Hofmann et al., 2004, Li et al., 2003, Li et al., 2005b, Moore et al., 2004, Nie et al., 2004, Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2009, Simmons et al., 2004). The use of pseudotype viruses not only provides a safe tool to analyze the entry process of highly pathogenic viruses under conventional biosafety condition, but also provides a unique system where the role of S protein in entry is not interfered by other viral proteins.",

To establish an efficient NL63 pseudotype virus entry system, we first needed to choose an entry-efficient S gene template. RNA viruses are well known to exist as quasispecies, a heterogeneous population that is composed of closely related sequence variants with minor nucleotide variation (Domingo et al., 2005). The ability to mediate virus entry may vary significantly among different variants. To obtain an S variant that is highly efficient in mediating virus entry, we cloned the RT-PCR products of the S gene into a pCAGGS vector and randomly picked 23 colonies. The plasmid DNA from each variant was co-transfected with a non-replicative HIV genome harboring a luciferase gene into 293T cells. The resulting pseudotype viruses were quantified and used to infect Huh-7 cells. Luciferase activity was measured as an index of entry level or infectivity, and was normalized to the highest observed level. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, variant No. 5 consistently showed the highest efficiency in virus entry. Twelve variants had an entry level less than 20% of No. 5 and 6 variants had <40% of entry level. Variant No. 5 was thus selected for further study and is referred to as wild type S (wt S) hereafter. Sequence analysis of this variant showed that it contained three amino acid substitutions (A685 \u2192 V, L853 \u2192 F and Q998 \u2192 K) compared to the reference standard sequence in GenBank (accession No. NC_005831).",

To understand the molecular basis of this dose-dependent effect, we measured the amount of S protein incorporated into pseudotype virus particles. Since the S protein with a C-myc epitope fused either at the N- or C-terminus failed to produce infectious pseudotye virus (not shown data), we purified soluble S1 protein and prepared a rabbit polyclonal antibody. This antibody was used to detect NL63 S protein hereafter. As a loading control, HIV-1 p24 protein was probed with a p24-specific antibody to confirm that similar amounts of pseudotype virus were used in each assay. The result revealed a positive correlation between the infectivity and amount of S protein incorporated into pseudotype virus particles (Fig. 2B and C).",

However, even the best deletion mutant, \u0394C18, was only about 1.5 times higher than wt S. Further deletions were deleterious to the infectivity as the entry levels of \u0394C29 and \u0394C38 were 75% and 3% of wt S, respectively.

Interestingly, the protein expression level of these mutants was higher than wt in cell lysate (upper panel in Fig. 3D). This was especially obvious for \u0394C18, \u0394C29 and \u0394C38, implying that the C-terminal 18 residues of S protein harbor inhibitory signal(s) for protein accumulation. This result also ruled out the possibility that the small amount of \u0394C38 S protein detected in virions was due to a protein expression defect. Since it is the S protein bound to the plasma membrane that is assembled into pseudotype virus, we checked the level of S protein on the cell surface using flow cytometry. The results showed that the expression level on the cell surface was positively correlated with the amount of S protein incorporated into virions (lower panel in Fig. 3D). Therefore, the entry defect of \u0394C38 is attributed to its defect in cell surface accumulation. This data also suggests that C-terminal 38 aa region of S plays an important role in anchoring to the plasma membrane. We also did an IP assay to test the receptor binding ability of these mutants. Based on the relative expression level (upper panel in Fig. 3D), we adjusted the volume of cell lysate in order to use similar amounts of S protein for the binding assay. The analysis revealed similar receptor binding ability among these mutants in three repeated experiments (Fig. 3E). This is expected since only the S1 domain of coronaviral S protein is involved in receptor binding while the S2 domain mediates membrane fusion during virus entry.",

Indeed, when we infected Huh-7 cells with same amount of these pseudotyped viruses (20,000 cpm/well in a 24-well plate), we consistently observed that VSVG mediated viral entry activity was about 100 times higher than that of SARS S and NL63 S (data not shown). Therefore, in order to compare the differences between NL63 S and SARS S and adjust the scales of VSVG mediated entry activity, we used 10 times less VSVG viruses (i.e. 2000 cpm/well) while the amount of NL63 and SARS viruses remained the same (20,000 cpm/well). Interestingly, we found that the viral entry of NL63-\u0394C18 was 2\u20133 folds higher than that of SARS S in Huh-7 cells (Fig. 4A).

These residues fall into three clusters that might represent three receptor binding motifs (RBMs) (Lin et al., 2008). Using the same method, Li et al. (2007) found that substitutions at 7 residues (G575, S576, N578, Y590, T591, V593, and G594) in a larger RBD (aa 301\u2013749) affected the receptor binding ability. Interestingly, these residues fall into the proposed RBM3. However, six of them were tested via a double-substitution strategy, i.e. they were combined in three mutants, G575/S576, G590/T591 and V593/G594. Thus, the contribution of individual residues to receptor binding remained unclear. Also, all of these residues were only tested in the context of RBD\u2013receptor interaction. To further define their roles in receptor binding and virus entry, we generated a total of 19 single substitution mutants mostly by replacing these residues with alanine in \u0394C18, a more physiologically relevant context (Fig. 1). Residues C497 and C500 were not tested since it was hard to uncouple their roles in receptor binding and maintaining proper structure by forming disulphide bonds. These S mutants were then tested for their S protein accumulation and abilities to mediate virus entry and receptor association.",

Based on the extent of entry level and receptor binding ability, mutants were placed into four categories. First, R530A behaved almost the same as \u0394C18 in every aspect we examined (Fig. 5A). Second, K501A and R518A showed a slight reduction in entry level (92\u201396%) and receptor binding ability (60\u201370%) (Fig. 5A). Third, N578 \u2192 Y enhanced the entry level (144%) and receptor binding ability (220%) (Fig. 5B). Fourth, the remaining 15 mutants experienced a more pronounced drop of entry level (<60%) and receptor binding ability (\u226440%). Therefore, in the context of a full-length S, 15 residues within RBD (Y498, V499, V531, G534, G537, D538, S540, G575, S576, E582, W585, Y590, T591, V593 and G594) were shown to be important for receptor binding and virus entry. They still form three RBMs, as found in the context of a minimal RBD (Lin et al., 2008). In addition, 8 mutants, W585R, G575A, V593A, G594A, V499L, D538A, E582A and T591A, also showed pronounced reduction of S protein in virions (\u226440%). In the former four mutants, the reduced S protein in virions may be due to the decreased cell surface expression; however, in the latter four mutants, their cell surface expression was not reduced, therefore the reduction may reflect a defect in virion assembly. These observations suggest that substitutions at these 8 sites may change the structural conformation of S protein and adversely affect its cell surface transportation/accumulation and/or stability.",

            "text": "In this report, we established an efficient NL63 pseudotype virus entry system. An S gene variant efficient in virus entry was chosen according to the quasispecies nature of RNA viruses (Fig. 2A). Amazingly, 18 out of 23 randomly selected variants had <40% of the entry level of the best variant. This reinforces the necessity to select an efficient S gene template for research. The infectivity of pseudotype virus was further promoted by truncation of the cytoplasmic 18 aa tail of NL63 S protein (Fig. 3). A similar phenomenon was observed in the pseudotype virus systems of SARS-CoV and TGEV (Fukushi et al., 2005, Giroglou et al., 2004, Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2009). However, compared to the 50\u2013100-fold enhancement of infectivity by C-terminal deletion in SARS-CoV (18\u201319 aa deletion) and TGEV (14 aa deletion), the maximum enhancement by 18 aa deletion in NL63 S was only 2 folds (Fig. 3B). This difference presumably reflects the nature of different S proteins. Virus infectivity was positively correlated with the amount of S protein in virions. Similar to the truncated S proteins of SARS-CoV and TGEV, NL63 mutants \u0394C8 and \u0394C18 were more efficient than wt full-length S in assembly into pseudotype virions (Fig. 3C), which should be due to higher expression levels on plasma membrane, the site of assembly and budding of lentivirus (Fig. 3D). But why did the removal of 18 aa from the C-terminus of S protein promote cell surface expression and overall protein accumulation in cell lysate? This may be related to the intracellular retention signals contained within the cytoplasmic tail region. Bioinformatics analysis reveals that the cytoplasmic tail of NL63 S contains a putative dibasic ER-targeting signal (KVHVQ) and a putative tyrosine-based endocytic signal (YYEF) at the very C-terminus (Lontok et al., 2004) (Fig. 3A). Such tyrosine-based endocytic signal allows membrane protein to be sorted from cell surface to endosomes and lysosomes for degradation (Bonifacino and Jackson, 2003). It has been demonstrated in infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) that the dibasic ER-targeting signal allows the S protein to be retained near the assembly site when expressed alone at low levels, but a high level of expression saturates the machinery and reaches to the plasma membrane (Lontok et al., 2004). Also in IBV, the endocytic signal was able to rapidly internalize the S protein from plasma membrane (Youn et al., 2005). SARS-CoV S protein does not have such an endocytic signal at its cytoplasmic tail, and is accordingly expressed on the plasma membrane. Introduction of this signal into SARS-CoV S protein caused it to be retained intracellularly (Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2004). The roles of these two signals have not been demonstrated for NL63, but they most likely function in a similar fashion to those in IBV and SARS-CoV mutant. This can explain why the absence of an ER-targeting signal and part of an endocytic signal (the critical tyrosine is still maintained) in \u0394C8 caused more protein accumulation on the plasma membrane and increased protein in cell lysate, while complete removal of these two signals in \u0394C18 further facilitated its plasma membrane translocation and protection from endocytosis and lysosomal degradation (Fig. 3A and C).",

This small region contains two cysteine residues conserved among all the coronaviruses.

Therefore, those residues (LSTGCCGCC) that are additionally deleted in \u0394C38 may participate in membrane anchoring. The exact boundaries of transmembrane (TM) domains of coronaviruses have not yet been experimentally specified. Different predictions include or exclude part of the cysteine-rich domains as part of the TM domain (Bosch et al., 2005, Broer et al., 2006, Chang et al., 2000, Godeke et al., 2000, Petit et al., 2007, Thorp et al., 2006, Ye et al., 2004, Zheng et al., 2006). According to TMpred, the strongly preferred TM model of NL63 S protein predicts a TM to be located between residues 1299 and 1316 (VWLIISVVFVVLLSLLVF), which does not include any cysteine-rich domains. This prediction was adopted for the TM boundaries used in this paper. However, based on SOSUI, another web-based prediction algorithm, the TM domain is located between residues 1303 and 1325 (ISVVFVVLLSLLVFCCLSTGCCG), which includes 7 residues that were deleted in \u0394C38.

These single residue mutants functioned differently (Fig. 5). Overall, their pseudotype virus infectivity was positively correlated with their receptor binding ability, although the infectivity of some mutants was interfered by their defects in plasma membrane translocation (e.g. W585R) or incorporation into virions (e.g. E582A). In terms of receptor binding, most of the mutants tested here functioned similarly between the context of a near full-length S and a small RBD. However, some residues that were important in the RBD (aa 476\u2013616) were not or of limited importance in \u0394C18. For instance, R530 \u2192 A abolished the RBD\u2013hACE2 association (Lin et al., 2008), but the same substitution in \u0394C18 had almost no effect on hACE2 binding and virus entry (Fig. 5). Likewise, K501 \u2192 A and R518 \u2192 A reduced the receptor binding ability by 100% and 90% in RBD, respectively (Lin et al., 2008), but same substitutions reduced the receptor binding by only 40% and 30%, respectively, and had very minor effect on virus entry (Fig. 5). Therefore, these three residues may be exposed on the surface of RBD but are partially or completely buried inside the S structure. This data is consistent with our previous finding that the minimum RBD had much higher receptor binding efficiency than S1 (Lin et al., 2008).",

            "text": "The crystal structure information of SARS-CoV RBD\u2013hACE2 complex and NL63-RBD\u2013hACE2 complex has significantly advanced our understanding of the molecular interaction between the S proteins and hACE2 receptor (Li et al., 2005a, Wu et al., 2009, Wu et al., 2011). The data obtained from the NL63 RBD\u2013hACE2 complex indicated that there are three receptor-binding motifs in the NL63 RBD (RBM1, 493\u2013513; RBM2, 531\u2013541; and RBM3, 585\u2013590) (Wu et al., 2009). These results are consistent with our previously published data suggesting that NL63 RBD may contain three receptor-binding regions (RI, RII, and RIII) (Lin et al., 2008 and Fig. 1). In addition, a panel of critical residues (such as Y498, G534, G537, S540, and W585) in the NL63 RBD that appears important for receptor binding may have direct contact with hACE2 receptor (Lin et al., 2008, Wu et al., 2009). Moreover, our current study has provided functional data demonstrating that some of the residues in RBM1 (Y498, V499), RBM2 (G534, G537, D538, S540), and RBM3 (G575, S576, E582, Y590, V593, and G594) may indeed play important roles in the viral entry (Fig. 1, Fig. 5; Wu et al., 2009). To further compare the molecular interactions between the SARS-RBA/hACE2 and NL63-RBD/hACE2, we had performed the structural modeling using several bioinformatics tools as described in Section 2 and identified a short homology domain between SARS-RBD and NL63-RBD (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, in SARS, this domain is within the receptor-binding motif (RBM) that is in close contact with hACE2. Among the 14 receptor-binding residues revealed by the structure model of SARS-CoV RBD\u2013hACE2 complex, 9 are located in this conserved region (underlined residues in Fig. 6A) (Li et al., 2005a). Among these residues, the importance of N479 and T487 has been demonstrated (Li et al., 2005b, Qu et al., 2005). More interestingly, this conserved domain in NL63 also contains 9 residues (underlined residues in Fig. 6A) that were experimentally shown to be critical for receptor binding and virus entry (Fig. 5). We therefore refer to the region as conserved binding motif (CBM). It has been shown that the RBDs of NL63 and SARS-CoV bind to a largely overlapping region in hACE2 (Li et al., 2007). Thus, it is possible that NL63 CBM may interact with hACE2 in a conformation similar to SARS-CoV CBM. To support this scenario, we used the structure model of SARS-CoV RBD\u2013hACE2 complex to explain the opposite activities of NL63 S mutants N578Y and E582A. The residue corresponding to N578 of NL63 in SARS-CoV is Y475 (Fig. 5A). Y475 is able to interact with three residues in hACE2, T27, K31 and Y83, among which, the interaction with Y83 is the strongest since they form a hydrogen bond (left panel in Fig. 6B) (Li et al., 2005a). After we mutated Y475 to N475, mimicking the site in NL63 (N578), it was no longer able to form a hydrogen bond with Y83 although it could still weakly interact with T27 and K31 through Van der Waals contacts (right panel in Fig. 6B). Conversely, if N578 of NL63 is replaced with tyrosine Y, a hydrogen bond is acquired. This model explains why N578Y showed enhanced receptor binding ability (Fig. 5B). It can also explain the drastically reduced receptor binding ability of E582A (Fig. 5A). The residue corresponding to E582 of NL63 in SARS-CoV is N479 (Fig. 6A). This residue is able to form a hydrogen bond with H34 in hACE2 (left panel in Fig. 6C) (Li et al., 2005a). However, if N479 is substituted with a glutamic acid residue, mimicking the site in NL63 (E582), a stronger RBD\u2013hACE2 complex is formed through a salt bridge (negative\u2013positive charge interaction) between E479 and H34 (middle panel in Fig. 6C). When this residue is changed to A, this interaction is lost (right panel in Fig. 6C).",

This viral system would also be useful for investigation of the effect of NL63-S on hACE2 expression and shedding, which may help determine whether the difference in pathogenicity is related to the effect on the hACE2 expression/shedding. Lastly, information obtained here not only provides insights into the studies of molecular mechanism of S\u2013receptor interaction and the function of NL63 S protein, but also provides important new information useful in development of effective vaccines, small peptides, and compounds or neutralizing antibodies to block NL63 infections.",

The underlined residues in SARS-CoV CBM represent those residues in contact with hACE2 revealed by the RBD\u2013hACE2 complex crystal structure of RBD\u2013hACE2 complex (Li et al., 2005a). The underlined residues in the NL63 CMB are those that were experimentally shown to be important for hACE2 binding (Fig. 4). (B) Structural basis for the enhanced receptor binding of N578Y. The left panel illustrates that residue Y475 of SARS-CoV forms a hydrogen bond with Y83 of hACE2 and has two weak Van der Waals interactions with T27 and K31 of hACE2. The right panel shows the loss of hydrogen bond when Y475 is changed to N475, mimicking the corresponding site in NL63 (N578), while the weak interactions with T27 and K31 are still retained. (C) Structural basis for the drastically reduced receptor binding of E582A. The left panel shows the hydrogen bond formed between N479 of SARS-CoV and H34 of hACE2. The middle panel illustrates that when N479 is changed to E479, mimicking the corresponding site in NL63 (E582), the contact between virus and receptor is strengthened by formation of a salt bridge that is stronger than a single hydrogen bond. The right panel depicts the loss of contact when E479 is changed to A479.",
