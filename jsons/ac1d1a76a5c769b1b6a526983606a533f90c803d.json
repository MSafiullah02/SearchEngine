            "text": "Cell signaling is accomplished via networks of transcriptional changes that lead to synthesis of distinct sets of proteins, which cause changes in growth, development, or metabolism. Treatments that elevate levels of hormones result in cascades of changes in gene expression driven by activation and synthesis of transcription factors which are required to turn on downstream genes. One approach to model these gene regulatory networks is to collect measurements of changes in abundance of gene transcripts across a time course. The expression of a gene encoding a transcriptional activator or repressor protein may signal to the next gene to either turn on or turn off downstream genes and their encoded proteins. Thus, time course transcriptomic data sets contain important information about how genes drive these changes in biological networks. Yet genome-wide transcript abundance assays examine tens of thousands of genes so identification of patterns or networks within these large data sets is difficult. It is also critical to filter the meaningful transcript changes in these data sets to remove genes whose responses are not above background or that are dissimilar due to biological or technical variation. Yet even though the bioinformatics community has developed statistical methods to filter the data [9] , additional approaches are needed to identify the networks and patterns in these large data sets.",

Rather, the method constructs a model over all of the data that uses each replicate as a source of information. The assumption is that at each level of the hierarchy there are commonalities in the data and parameters. Thus, the replicate data is not independent. Second, the addition of time series adjustment to improve the independence of the model's residuals gives these techniques stronger statistical foundations. Third, the combination of Bayesian model averaging with a cutting edge genetic algorithm provides rigorous estimates of posterior probabilities for edges. These computational modeling algorithms are derived using rigorous mathematical and statistical techniques and are computationally efficient. The models produced are easily understandable.",

Variations of Bayesian modeling can be found in [7, 11, 19] .

Earlier variations included computing posterior probabilities for a single replicate [11] and for multiple replicates with both hierarchical [18] and independent [17] structures. Over the course of this research, the search procedure has changed from Metropolis Hastings to genetic algorithms. Genetic algorithms' execution times are typically polynomial rather than the doubly exponential execution time, in terms of the numbers of time points and genes, of Metropolis Hastings. This variation also uses a Bayesian version of the Cross generational elitist selection, Heterogeneous recombination, Cataclysmic mutation algorithm (CHC) [6] . Genetic algorithms are motivated by the operators of selection, crossover, and mutation. The CHC variation does not allow the crossover of similar parents. Once the population becomes too homogeneous, then a cataclysmic mutation event regenerates the population from the current most fit parents. The Bayesian CHC (BCHC) implemented in this paper uses a hierarchical statistical construct (the Norris-Patton Likelihood) as the fitness function.",

This is usually due to the remaining influence of the previous time's response data. In complicated modeling situations (e.g., like ours where we need to obtain closed form likelihoods of DAGs within a hierarchical structure in order to produce posterior probabilities of edges), it is common to derive results as if there were non-correlated residuals, as we have done in previous work. Our previous work has shown utility both for simulated and biological data, but we now rigorously incorporate a time series adjustment into our model. This should result in substantially less correlated residuals and thus more accurate likelihoods for the DAGs. Since these likelihoods are the foundations for the edges' estimated posterior probabilities, these estimates should also be improved. Our time series adjustment is an integer autoregressive adjustment of order 1 in the commonly used family of Markov conditioning. It is a version of Kedem's and Fokianos' autoregressive model [12, page 184 ]. In our setting, this simply adds the child's data at the previous time as an additional regressor for the child's data at the current time. Thus, much of the child's data at the previous time's influence would be regressed out leaving less correlated, closer to independent, residuals from one time to the next.",

By incorporating time series adjustments into the modeling process, the residuals' independence is much improved; thus, yielding a less approximated, more accurate likelihood function. The continuation of this research includes four tasks. First, the computational networks have been sent to the Muday lab for biological investigation, confirmation and interpretation. Second, in this paper, we investigated the enhancement of times series adjustment on a next state one step model. There are two other time paradigms, next state one and two steps and cotemporal, each of which has a time series adjustment analogue and a corresponding Norris-Patton likelihood. Comparing and contrasting the computational results of these three distinct modeling methods-as well as their biological interpretations-are important in understanding the gene interaction models developed using this methodology. Third, we will further consider higher order autoregressive adjustment to continue improving the independence of the residuals. Fourth, effort is underway to implement nonuniform priors in the modeling techniques. This would permit construction of gene interaction models that reflect relationships found in the literature.",
