            "text": "China has been the epicenter of emerging and re\u2010emerging viral infections that continue to stir a global concern. In the last 20 years, China has witnessed several emerging viral diseases, including an avian influenza in 1997,\n1\n the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003,\n2\n and a severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) in 2010.\n3\n The most recent crisis was the outbreak of an ongoing viral pneumonia with unknown etiology in the city of Wuhan, China. On 12 December 2019, Wuhan Municipal Health Commission (WMHC) reported 27 cases of viral pneumonia with 7 of them being critically ill. Most of them had a history of exposure to the virus at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market where poultry, bats, snakes; and other wildlife animals were also sold.\n4\n On 3 January 2020, WMHC updated the number of cases to a total of 44 with 11 of them in critical condition. On 5 January, the number of cases increased to 59 with 7 critically ill patients. The viral pneumonia outbreak was not caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV), influenza virus, or adenovirus as determined by laboratory tests.\n4\n On 10 January, it was reported that a novel coronavirus designated 2019\u2010nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO)\n5\n was identified by high\u2010throughput sequencing of the viral RNA genome, which was released through http://virological.org. More significantly, the newly identified 2019\u2010CoV has also been isolated from one patient. The availability of viral RNA sequence has made it possible to develop reverse\u2010transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) methods for the detection of viral RNA in samples from patients and potential hosts.\n6\n As a result, 217 patients were confirmed to be infected with the 2019\u2010nCoV, and 9 patients died as of 20 January 2020. Several patients from Wuhan were also reported in Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Japan. High\u2010throughput sequencing of viral RNA from patients\u2019 samples has identified a novel coronavirus designated 2019\u2010nCoV by the World Health Organization. Currently, a total of 14 full\u2010length sequences of the 2019\u2010nCoV were released to GISAID and GeneBank.",

Our results show that the novel coronavirus sequence obtained from the viral pneumonia outbreak occurring in the city of Wuhan forms a separate group that is highly distinctive to SARS\u2010CoV. The SARS\u2010CoV first emerged in China in 2002 and then spread to 37 countries/regions in 2003 and caused a travel\u2010related global outbreak with 9.6% mortality rate.\n26\n More importantly, results from our analysis reveal a homologous recombination may occurred between the bat coronavirus and an origin\u2010unknown coronavirus within the viral spike glycoprotein gene. Sequence homology analysis of the partial spike glycoprotein genes (1\u2010783 bp) from the 2019\u2010nCoV was done through BLAST at the NCBI website. Interestingly, no similar sequence was found with known sequence in the database, suggesting that a putative recombination parent virus was still unknown. Previous study suggested that the recombination of SARS in the spike glycoprotein genes might have mediated the initial cross\u2010species transmission event from bats to other mammals.\n27\n Bootscanning plot analysis (data not shown) suggested that the major parents of the 2019\u2010nCoV originated from Clade A (bat\u2010SL\u2010CoVZC45 and bat\u2010SL\u2010CoVZXC21) but formed a monophyletic cluster different from them.
