In the early phase, the typical CT manifestations were multifocal bilateral or isolated round ground-glass opacity with or without patchy consolidations, prominent peripherally subpleural distribution and mainly in posterior part or lower lobe. In the progressive phase, the number, range and density of the lesions increased significantly, and the distribution moved from peripheral to central. In the recovery phase, the lesions gradually 6 absorbed, leaving a few cord like high-density shades [14] . Clinical cure was considered to be the recovery of temperature for more than 3 days, the obvious improvement of respiratory symptoms, the absorption of pulmonary imaging lesions and two consecutive negative RT-PCR results of respiratory samples at least one day apart [9] .

This result is consistent with previous reports [15, 16] .

Some patients who had at least twice negative nucleic acid tests and reached the discharge standard were found to be positive again during reexamination. There may be intermittent virus expulsion, leading to nucleic acid results positive again in patients 11 recovered from COVID-19 [20] . As time goes on, a large number of patients will enter the recovery stage and face discharge, and the monitoring of low viral load will be more frequent.

RT-PCR was conducted with primers and probes targeting the ORF1ab and N genes and a positive reference gene. Reaction system and amplification conditions were performed according to the manufacturer's specifications (Shanghai BioGerm Medical Technology Co. LTD, China). The result was considered valid only when the cycle threshold (Ct) value of the reference gene was \u2264 38. The result was considered positive when the Ct values of both target genes were \u2264 38, negative when they were both > 38. If only one of the target genes had a Ct value \u2264 38 and the other > 38, it was interpreted as a single-gene positive. ddPCR was performed via the COVID-19 digital PCR detection kit (TargetingOne, Beijing, China) and the TargetingOne Digital PCR System (TargetingOne, Beijing, China, Licensed by CFDA, registration number: 20170025; 20190097; 20192220517). The kit allows the detection of the ORF1ab gene, N gene, and a positive reference gene. The limit of detection was 10 copies/test.",

According to the RT-PCR results, 95 samples were positive, 67 were single-gene positive, and 161 were negative. The ddPCR results of the 95 positive samples were also positive, and the Ct value of RT-PCR was highly correlated with the copy number determined by ddPCR (ORF1ab, R 2 =0.83; N, R 2 =0.87). However, when the Ct value was between 34 and 38, there was no correlation or only poor correlation (ORF1ab, R 2 =0.08; N, R 2 =0.16) (data not shown). Among the 67 single-gene positive samples, 26 (38.8%) were negative in ddPCR and 41 (61.2%) were positive with copy numbers ranging from 11.1-123.2 copies/test (Figure 2B).
