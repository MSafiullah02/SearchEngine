More than two million people have been affected to date, with multiple health and socio-economic consequences. This infectious disease of poverty was first discovered in Uganda in 1947; only 15 cases were documented prior to 2007, and the disease remained in a state of dormancy until now [1]. It has been identified in more than 20 countries in South and Central America, the Caribbean, Asia-Pacific and Africa and some Pacific islands (Fiji, Vanuatu, Micronesia) have also reported sporadic outbreaks [2], [3], [4]. Arbovirus disease epidemics have the potential to worsen the global maternal\u2013child health burden in most vector-borne disease-prone countries [5] (Fig. 1\n).",

Zika is also part of the flavivirus family that also includes dengue, West Nile and yellow fever. Zika virus (ZIKV) can be transmitted through blood and other bodily fluids such as semen during sexual intercourse or mother-to-fetus transmission throughout pregnancy [2]. ZIKV disease outbreaks have been linked with pregnancy syndrome, newborn and child defects and premature deaths [1], [2]. Colombia has recoded 13,500 suspected cases and predicts 600,000 cases by the end of 2016 with significant social, health and economic impacts. In comparison, Brazil reported 4000 cases of fetal microcephaly during pregnancy yet had only 150 cases total in 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, of the 25,165 infected cases, more than 3177 pregnant women have been documented with the ZIKV in Colombia [6], [7]. There is an urgent need for innovative approaches and tools for early detection and rapid confirmation of ZIKV-linked microcephaly and early warning systems to provide timely evidence-based information to guide decision making policies and strategies including pre- and ante-natal counseling and strict abortion measures. We also need new methods for managing climate change, environmental and ecological systems in hospital and maternity settings and hygiene and sanitation efforts to interrupt any potential sources of transmission.",

Previous dengue epidemics have been documented but less virulent and localized than the ongoing widespread ZIKV epidemics. Nevertheless, there is still much to be learned regarding the full human impact of ZIKV compared to the pathophysiological and immunological consequences of dengue virus. ZIKV can be transmitted to humans by infected Aedes mosquito bites, infected mother-to-child trans-placenta bodily fluid diffusion, blood transfusion, unprotected sexual intercourse with an infected individual and perhaps breastfeeding. More short and long-term operational research is needed to further establish the risk factors and determinants and to confirm the association between Zika virus infections, microcephaly and related neurological aberrations suspected in fetal and childhood development (Table 1\n).",

Molecular diagnostic assay results from sophisticated and differential medical interpretations (e.g., ultrasonography, MRI, RT PCR assay) are not often available and accessible and are also expensive for vulnerable populations in remote rural and semi-urban settings. Other alternative solutions include providing advocacy and mitigation platforms against climate changes, urbanization and globalization approaches to reducing mother-to-child transmission, comprehensive antenatal and postnatal programs for women, sexual education and use of protective tools and measures, adherence and quality outcomes. Containing the current public health scourge of ZIKV and DENV diseases will require the integration of population-based mass drug administration and immunization interventions supported by robust evidence-based and integrated epidemiological, socio-cultural, climatic and environmental surveillance and information management to guide decision-making policy and rapid responses. Nevertheless, implementation of real time, contextual and practical laws and regulations focusing on positive social behavioral attitudes and perceptions is needed to strengthen health systems, nurture safe motherhood and childhood practices and foster evidence-driven community project ownership to accelerate recovery programs and activities in affected communities.",

Implementers require \u201cearly-warning systems\u201d to provide reliable, user-friendly and cost-effective programs to monitor progress, to foster evidence-based decision making and optimal resilient culture and integrated quality packages, including mosquito-borne disease awareness and health education campaigns, mitigation and recovery measures. ZIKV rates might be underestimated and could even be higher because confusion with other diseases with similar symptoms could be misleading due to acquired immunity to other tropical infections in ZIKV human reservoirs, which might also complicate the actual Zika cases.

Table 1 shows that Zika and dengue have similar structural characteristics including fear, discrimination and even stigmatization [2], [4], [10], [21]. Biologically, the viruses have similar host reservoirs, likely modes of transmission and spread in human populations, mainly through human-to-human behavioral spread [22], [25]. This includes exposure to bodily fluids such as blood and semen. Zika is mainly transmitted via unprotected sex and via semen during poor sanitary practices [15]; however, contact with infected bodily fluids is one route of person-to-person transmission [12], [21]. The incubation period of both viral diseases is short and varies between 2 and 23 days; progression to infectiousness is between 4 and 7 days [21]. Blood-fed Zika mosquito screening and monitoring of emerging viral diseases, especially in maternal and child populations, are needed. Unraveling Aedes vector competence and genetic evolution determinants could not only provide significant insights into sudden ZIKV outbreaks, but can also provide a better understanding of virus epidemiology and ecology, including water breeding containers, buckets, flower pots, tires or construction sites [14], [15], [22].",

Because most African countries have limited surveillance indicators to assess the threat of re-emergence, early warning disease alerts, community awareness outreach and education are essential. Both Zika and dengue are spread in a similar way, via body fluids, and they currently do not have an effective antiretroviral cure [8], [15], [21]. Infections caused by Ebola hemorrhagic fever have killed 50\u201370% of their victims; 70% of people living with Zika or dengue are in sub-Saharan Africa [3]. Although Zika can be highly lethal in the fetus during pregnancy, more so than dengue [23], [24]. The number of dengue-infected individuals globally is far greater than the number of Zika-infected individuals [3], [15]. Additionally, Zika and dengue are largely restricted to low-income countries affected by poverty, civil war, high maternal and infant mortality rates, low education levels and internal strife [16], [18]. The areas currently most affected by Zika include forest fringes and unstable African countries [20], [28], [29]. These areas have very weak health systems, which accounts for the re-emergence of these infectious diseases [15], [20]. Therefore, strengthening community health systems and fostering effective prevention and care delivery capacity are paramount. Tourists or mobile cross-border migrants in affected areas are at higher risk of a disproportionate burden, especially vulnerable newborns, children and mothers, who easily travel from one area to another [30], [31]. This can stretch the already fragile health systems of these affected settings and increase the vector or arbovirus transmission rates, which can spread unrecognized and from underdiagnosed reservoirs [16], [32].",

Implementation of effective and sustainable interventions such as community social engagement and participation outreach, prompt identification and case management, surveillance and preparedness systems, contact tracing, laboratory diagnosis, community mobilization, recovery systems for survivors, safe burial practices and behavioral changes (e.g., promotion of condom usage. abstinence, antenatal counseling) among ZIKV victims offer new opportunities to eliminate ZIKV, other sexually transmitted diseases (STIs) and dengue in the Western hemisphere, Pacific islands and some parts of sub-Saharan Africa [15], [21]. Maternal perinatal education and increasing household income in affected communities can have a significant impact in reducing child deaths and maternal vulnerability. Moreover, there is an emerging resurgence of dengue patterns and trend in poor countries and the Americas, likely related to climate changes, global warming and intense environmental perturbations. Strengthening the development of more effective and affordable early warning signals and surveillance indicators and tools, preventive and curative treatments to improve community care and wellness are needed [1], [5], [19], [21].",

For example, the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) is making robust strides in identifying and supporting research areas as part of its response. National governments and stakeholders should improve efforts to reduce inequality and implement fundamental reforms such as delaying pregnancy and limiting unnecessary travel [11]. Previous studies have shown that male circumcision, which is highly practiced in West Africa, is associated with a lower risk of ZIKV and other sexually transmitted diseases compared to other countries with low/no male circumcision rates [27], [28].

Early in the course of ZIKV and DENV research, the mysterious diseases were perceived as illnesses of forest regions [15]. Therefore, infected individuals were able to silently and unknowingly spread the infection for years [32]. In contrast, Ebola and HIV infections and related deaths are rapid and therefore more terrifying; however, dengue cases can be identified and isolated and patient contacts can be traced and monitored [15], [21]. As indicated in early arbovirus research, most healthcare workers and blood-transfused patients might be infected with Zika or dengue because of a lack of proper diagnostic capacities, poor elucidation of the routes of transmission, pathogenesis and spread. A similar effect was observed among dengue or ZIKV-infected health workers during the early history of the disease. In addition, lessons learned from the global dengue response should be extended to ZIKV in a timely manner [25]. Apart from that, Ebola virus requires more sophisticated isolation measures to contain the disease [21], [29] than does Zika or dengue.",

It is also important to expand the coverage of innovative high-impact interventions including existing immunization campaigns to limit threatening co-infections and ensure the survival of women and children [28], [29], [31], [32]. Addressing mosquito vector and viral surveillance challenges in the context of limited resources or urbanized settings is necessary for effective treatment and vaccine accessibility and availability to the most hard-to-reach remote areas and vulnerable populations. Also critical is addressing the shortage of trained field and community healthcare workers, weak health systems, weak community engagement, lack of participation in early identification, challenging diagnostics and self-reporting, stigmatization and weak prompt isolation/quarantine facilities [28], [31], [32], [33]. The burden faced by children and mothers highlights the importance of increasing access to community social mobilization and participation, health education and awareness programs, facilities and effective emergency responses, including delivery of palliative antiretroviral drugs to affected communities, tracking and tracing of suspected cases and sexual partners, monitoring of risk factors and determinants of ZIKV and DENV threats and epidemic resurgence [33], [34], [35]. Improving health systems in LIMCs against the transmission dynamics and spread of ZIKV and DENV and their overlapping characteristic signs and symptoms is challenging due to clinical and diagnostic limitations.",
