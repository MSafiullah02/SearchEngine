This vaccine concept is based on the identification of a minimal set of antigens that induce a competent immune response to a pathogen or neoplasm. Recognition of antigens occurs through the presentation of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the antigen, in the correct immunological milieu. In its minimal form, an IDV would contain only adjuvanated B cell and T cell epitopes in delivery vehicles such as liposomes. When these minimal components are packaged in an appropriate delivery vehicle, the complete package comprises an IDV.",

Because epitope-based IDVs are generally considered to be safe, when compared to other vectored or attenuated live vaccines, many have progressed rapidly from pre-clinical concept into clinical trials. In the cancer vaccine field, where epitope-based vaccines are well-established, many such vaccines are currently in Phase I/II clinical trials (Pietersz, Pouniotis and Apostolopoulos 2006).",

            "text": "The size of the immunome has been puzzling vaccinologists for decades. Certainly, there are examples in the literature that \u2018a single epitope protects.\u2019 For example, Crowe et al. (2006) recently found that immunization with a single Th epitope provided a one-log reduction in influenza viral titers early in infection. A single epitope has also been shown to protect against viral disease in woodchucks (Menne et al. 1997), and multiple single epitopes have protected mice against an array of pathogens (An and Whitton 1997 and Olsen et al. 2000). A more diverse set of T cell epitopes appear to be critical to immune response to vaccinia (in mice): 49 Class I MHC epitopes were shown to contribute to the large majority of the CD8+ T cell immune response (Moutaftsi et al. 2006). Remarkably, it was found that 49 of these predicted epitopes (derived from more than 175,000 candidates) represented over 90% of the vaccinia-specific CD8 T cell repertoire. How this number might be extrapolated to humans is unknown, but the result is relevant because 49 epitopes is few enough to be easily packaged and delivered in a vaccine. An epitope-based IDV for genetically diverse populations of humans will almost certainly require more than that number of epitopes, particularly if the vaccine is intended to protect against complex bacteria or viruses, or against solid tumors presenting variable antigenic profiles. Harnessing the power of immunoinformatics accelerates the tasks of defining the immunome and of identifying and developing new vaccines for human diseases.",

In the case of small viral genomes, it may be possible to include the entire genome in the search universe. In the case of larger bacterial and viral pathogens, the traditional vaccine targets include surface proteins and secreted proteins (which can easily be found using in silico screening programs), toxins (which can be identified through homology matching), and virulence factors (which can be identified through the use of comparative genomics).

However, conservation across species should not be confused with conservation within\nspecies variants. Sequence conservation within species variants is a highly desirable trait for vaccine components and one that the IDV approach is particularly well suited to harness. RNA viruses in particular (HCV, HIV, coronaviruses) are highly variable pathogens. In these cases, selecting epitopes that are conserved across variants or subtypes may allow for the development of a more broadly applicable vaccine. Alternatively, single proteins that are relatively well conserved, when compared to the balance of the target pathogen, can be selected as vaccine candidates. Recently, for example, one team has developed a hexon-epitope vaccine that may be effective against a range of adenoviruses, across serotypes (Leen et al. 2008).",

Several B cell epitope prediction tools, such as 3DEX and CEP, have been proposed and are in the process of being refined (Enshell-Seijffers et al. 2003; Schreiber et al. 2005; Kulkarni et al. 2005). Unfortunately, the computational resources and modeling complexity required to predict B cell epitopes are enormous. This complexity is due in part to the inherent flexibility in the complementarity determining regions (CDR) of the antibody and in part due to glycosylation, and other post-translational modifications can result in modification of B cell epitopes.",

When considering B cell antigens as potential subunit vaccines, it may be important to also consider their T cell epitope content since the quality and kinetics of the antibody response is dependent upon the presence of T help. B cell antigens, which contain a significant T help, may outperform B cell antigens lacking cognate help. And in some cases, an identified T cell epitope may contain a B cell epitope. Although different epitopes activate T and B cells, it has been widely reported that B cell epitopes have been shown to co-localize near, or overlap, Class II (Th, CD4+) epitopes (Graham et al. 1989; Rajnavolgyi et al. 1999).",

New approaches are emerging, which may improve the success rate and, indeed, the results from recent clinical trials prove the principle. One approach is to identify epitopes that are unique to the tumor (prostate, lung, colon) and to pre-screen the patient for response to the peptide. This approach, called personalized vaccination, takes into account the diversity of CTL epitope recognition among patients. Whereas the response rates to classical (non-personalized) peptide vaccines have been disappointing, responses to personalized vaccines (in a Phase I trial, conducted in Japan) have been as high as 11.1% in the advanced cancers and equal to or more than 20% in malignant glioma and cervical cancers, respectively (Itoh and Yamada 2006).",

            "text": "T cell epitopes are linear peptides that bind to MHC molecules. Binding is mediated by the interactions between the R-groups of the amino acids in the peptide ligand and the pockets on the floor of the MHC binding groove. Because the MHC:peptide interaction is well characterized, pattern-matching algorithms can be used to screen protein sequences for peptides that will bind MHC. The authors of this report currently use the EpiMatrix system, a suite of epitope-mapping tools that has been validated by more than a decade of use in selecting putative epitopes for in vitro and in vivo studies (see references (De Groot et al. 1997; Bond et al. 2001; Dong et al. 2004; McMurry et al. 2005; Koita et al. 2006). The EpiMatrix algorithm is based on a set of Class I and Class II HLA matrices wherein individual frequencies of all 20 amino acids (aa) in each HLA pocket position are applied to the prediction of overlapping 9- and 10-mer peptides. In a typical analysis, protein antigens are parsed into overlapping 9-mer frames where each 9-mer overlaps the last by eight amino acids. Each 9-mer is then scored for predicted binding affinity to one or more Class I or Class II HLA alleles. In order to compare potential epitopes across multiple HLA alleles, EpiMatrix raw scores are converted to a normalized \u2018Z\u2019 scale. Peptides scoring above 1.64 on the EpiMatrix \u2018Z\u2019 scale (typically the top 5% of any given sample) are likely to be MHC ligands. Since Class II epitopes can be promiscuous, our approach to the prediction of Class II epitopes is to estimate the binding potential of each frame with respect to each of a panel of eight common Class II alleles (DRB1*0101, *0301, *0401, *0701, *0801, *1101, *1301, and *1501). Taken together, these alleles \u2018cover\u2019 the genetic backgrounds of most humans worldwide (Southwood et al. 1998) and they also represent the predominant types of \u2018pockets\u2019 for the most common MHC.",

By correcting for the size and expected epitope density, the potential immunogenicity candidate vaccine antigens can be directly compared.

In our prospective evaluations, significant correlations were found between the IFN-gamma response to a given antigen and the iTEM scores for individual subjects (for data published in Koren et al.

In addition, Livingston et al. (2001) have tested a standard spacer sequence (-GPGPG-) for vaccine constructs consisting of MHC-II-restricted, Th-cell epitopes; the use of this spacer disrupts junctional epitopes that might compete for degradation or for MHC binding (both G and P are unusual carboxy-terminal anchors for a peptide that binds to Class II MHC). This approach has been used for constructs with up to 20 epitopes, in assays where responses were detected to the majority of epitopes (Livingston et al. 2001).",

A prototype vaccine containing only Class II epitopes has been tested in challenge studies in HLA DRB1*0101 transgenic mice. For this vaccine, the EpiMatrix algorithm was utilized to identify highly promiscuous T cell epitopes within the tularemia genome. Twenty-five Class II-restricted epitopes were selected, synthesized, and screened in vitro using a recombinant soluble HLA Class II competition-binding assay (described above). Peptides that bound with high affinity were then tested ex vivo in ELISpot assays with blood obtained from F. tularensissubsp. tularensis-exposed individuals. SearchLight analysis was also performed on supernatants derived from human cell culture stimulated with peptide using a panel of nine cytokines. Forty-two percent of peptides bound to DRB*0101 and are likely to bind to several other alleles (in that they were predicted using the ClustiMer algorithm). ELISpot assays showed positive IFN-gamma responses to 21/25 individual peptides and to peptide pools in nearly all of the 23 human study. The number of epitopes recognized per subject ranged from 1 to 17 and averaged 4 per subject; not every peptide was tested for every subject.",

In order to maximize immunogenicity across HPV subtypes, our strategy involves analyzing variant strains of HPV protein sequences, using (1) EpiMatrix to identify Class I and Class II HLA motif matches, (2) Conservatrix to identify those motif matches that are conserved, and (3) Epi-Assembler to weave together the conserved immunogenic sequences into a full immunogenic consensus sequence (ICS) antigen. A full ICS vaccine antigen would retain the fundamental structure of its naturally occurring counterparts; however, it will contain more and better epitopes than would occur in any such one counterpart. The authors have identified five conserved epitopes in E1 and E2, which have stimulated significant responses in ELISpot IFN-g assays. In the proposed vaccine, these epitopes and others will be incorporated in their natural context within the proteins, which could be delivered as DNA, proteins, or a prime-boost combination. By preserving the natural flanking regions surrounding our epitopes, we hope to retain, in large part, the natural processes surrounding HPV protein degradation, transport, and presentation as they occur during natural infections. The ICS approach described here is the same as that illustrated in Fig. 5, but extending over the full natural length of the protein. For a more in-depth review of a similar approach being pursued for influenza, see McMurry et al. (2008).\n\n",

Multiple antigen or epitope vaccinations such as the approach illustrated here could be one way to elicit the sort of strong TH1 response necessary to pathogens following infection, in the context of a therapeutic vaccine. This approach could also be useful for a wide range of pathogens for which genomes have been partially or completely mapped. As described in this chapter, our group is actively pursuing the development of epitope-driven vaccines for HIV (De Groot et al. 2005; Koita et al. 2006), Franciscella tularensis, Helicobacter pylori, and smallpox. We have progressed from genome-derived epitope mapping to challenge studies in less than one year for some of these vaccine development programs.",

One reason for the relative paucity of IDVs in clinical development is that the immunoinformatics tools for developing these vaccines have really only evolved in the last 10 to 15 years. The average length of time to develop a vaccine may be 20 years or more. While immunoinformatics tools are useful for accelerating the discovery and pre-clinical stage of vaccine development, testing vaccines in animal models and developing clinical trials is a lengthy process. It is likely that IDV and epitope-based IDV will begin to enter clinical trials and emerge on the market in greater numbers in 5 to 10 years.",

Mismatches with the selected epitope sequences are represented with the letter X. Right panel: Additional epitopes are then identified, which overlap with the natural N- and C-terminal flanking regions of the core 9-mer epitope. The overlap length requirement is decreased by one amino acid iteratively until reaching a minimum of three overlapping amino acids. If more than one suitable overlap is identified, the overlapping peptide with the higher overall EpiMatrix rank is selected. This process is repeated using the extended peptide as the new core sequence. The cycle can be repeated for the length of an entire protein or can be truncated when the peptide reaches a length that can be easily produced synthetically",
