Severity ranges from mild, all the way to severe excessive cough which can cause vomiting, urinary incontinence, and even rib fractures. The cough reflex serves a purpose, and that is to clear the airway from bacteria, debris, and secretions. The physiologic pathway that results in cough is rather complex. Humans have cough receptors in the respiratory tract, pericardium, diaphragm, pleura, esophagus, and stomach. There are chemical and mechanical receptors that respond to a variety of stimuli which results in an impulse that travels through the vagus nerve to the \"cough centre\" in the medulla. An efferent signal then travels down to the spinal motor nerves to the expiratory musculature, producing cough [2] . Despite serving a purpose physiologically, cough is an unpleasant symptom and proves to be the most common new complaint seen in primary care [3] . There are many possible causes for a troublesome cough. The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) suggests that assessing the duration of symptoms is the most useful first step in assessing patients who present with cough. Based on duration, cough is classified as acute (<3 weeks), subacute (3-8 weeks) , and chronic (>8 weeks). Duration of symptoms is key because acute, subacute, and chronic cough each has distinct etiologies [4] . Generally, patients with cough >3 weeks should be referred to their physician. Pharmacists play an important role in the assessment and management of patients with cough. They can identify patients who need urgent medical attention, those who are appropriate for self-care, and anyone in between. Cough assessment involves gathering a focused history from the patient, concentrating on clinical features, exposure history, presence or absence of red flags, and key patient-specific factors. Once the pharmacist has gathered the necessary information, he/she can move on to next steps such as prescribing an OTC medication or referral to the family physician or the emergency department.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 104, "end": 107, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 823, "end": 826, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 971, "end": 974, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1275, "end": 1286, "text": "(3-8 weeks)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1413, "end": 1416, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Acute cough is most commonly caused by viral infections, followed by exacerbations of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or pneumonia.
