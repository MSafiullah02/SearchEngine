Our model dynamics is expressed by a single prognostic variable in an integro-differential equation. All unknown parameters are described with a single, time-dependent variable \u03ba(t). We show that our model has similarities to classic compartmental models, such as SIR, and that the variable \u03ba(t) can be interpreted as the effective reproduction number R eff . The advantages of our approach are the simplicity of having only one equation, the numerical stability due to an integral formulation and the reliability because the model is formulated with the most trustable statistical data variable: the number of cumulative diagnosed positive cases 1 .

(which was not certified by peer review) : medRxiv preprint of COVID-19. Once this dynamic variable is calculated, other nondynamic variables, such as the number of heavy cases (hospital beds), the number of intensive-care cases (ICUs) and the fatalities, can be derived from it using a similarly stable, integral approach. The formulation with a single equation allows us to calculate from real data the values of the effective reproduction number, which can then be fitted. The extrapolated values of \u03ba can be used in the model to make a reliable forecasts, though under the assumption that measures for reducing infections are maintained. We have applied our model to more than 15 countries and results are available via a web-based platform [6]. In this paper we focus on the data for two exemplary countries, Italy and Germany, and show that the model is capable of reproducing the course of the epidemic in the past and forecasting its course for a period of two to three weeks with a reasonable numerical stability.",

The easiest approach is curve fitting of available data. In [1] the number of cumulative diagnosed positive COVID-19 cases P (t) was assumed to be an error function. This is true if the number of daily new cases P (t) can be described by a Gaussian distribution. As we will show, a symmetric distribution function P (t) corresponds to an effective reproduction number that converges rapidly to zero. This might be true for China data. In Italy and Germany we observed a final value for R eff between 0.6 to 0.8, leading to an asymmetric function P (t) with a long tail. Although the peak date has been predicted well in [1] , the predicted total cases and fatalities differ by more than 30%. Current deterministic models were developed with the aim of simulating possible scenarios and showing the effect of containment and mitigation measurements. They are \"bottom-up\" in the sense that they are based on the knowledge of epidemiological parameters, such as the basic reproduction number R 0 or the time between contacts T c , to name a few. Three reasons make it difficult to set up these complex models for forecasting: the epidemiological parameters are unknown and change in time;",

Also note that phases of different severity in mitigation measures lead to small intermediate plateaus for \u03ba(t). This behaviour of the data was also noticed in [9] , especially for fatalities.

We applied our model to many countries and gave a special focus on the data of Italy and Germany. After extracting the three parameters we have been able to model the course of the epidemic in both countries rather well. We found it astonishing how the parameters \u03ba 0 and \u03ba \u221e differ between the two countries -inviting us to interpret them in terms of effectiveness of measures, social organisation (in Italy elderly vulnerable people are more likely found to live with the younger part of the family) as well as organisation and quality of the health system.",

Only data before the vertical black line, i.e., before April 23, have been used to tune the model The number of daily and cumulative fatalities for Germany are shown in fig. 8. The course of fatalities was not well represented due to a sudden rise in case fatality rate about April, 15. We therefore re-tuned the model on April 24, setting the mean case fatality rate to\u03bc = 0.45. Other Variables. As stated before, once the number of cumulative COVID-19 cases P (t) are known, other variables can be derived from them, such as the number of cured individuals, hospital beds needed, intensive care units (ICU's) needed, active and closed cases",
