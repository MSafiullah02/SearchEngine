Lung function (FEV1 and FVC) and a panel of 15 inflammatory biomarkers (including cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, CRP and WBC count) from blood samples were analysed subjects aged 70 years (Kuhlmann et al. 2013). WBC count, CRP and VCAM-1 were found to relate to poorer lung function. A dose-related association was found for the combination WBC count and CRP towards FEV1 and WBC and VCAM-1 towards FVC. This indicates that combination of two biomarkers yielded more information than assessing them one by one when analysing the association between systemic inflammation and lung function.",

Increased concentrations of ROS in the lungs of such patients are reflected by elevated concentrations of oxidative stress markers in the breath, airways, lung tissue and blood. Traditionally, the measurement of these biomarkers has involved invasive procedures to procure the samples or to examine the affected compartments, to the patient\u2019s discomfort. Non-invasive approaches to measure oxidative stress have been investigated. The collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a non-invasive sampling method for real-time analysis and evaluation of oxidative stress biomarkers in the lower respiratory tract airways. The biomarkers of oxidative stress such as H2O2, F2-isoprostanes, malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, antioxidants, glutathione and nitrosative stress such as nitrate/nitrite and nitrosated species can be measured in EBC. Oxidative stress biomarkers also have been measured for various antioxidants in disease prognosis. EBC is currently used as a research and diagnostic tool in free radical research, yielding information on redox disturbance and the degree and type of inflammation in the lung. It is expected that EBC can be exploited to detect specific levels of biomarkers and monitor disease severity in response to treatment.",

Despite its prevalence, there are many challenges to proper diagnosis and management of pneumonia. There is no accurate and timely gold standard to differentiate bacterial from viral disease, and there are limitations in precise risk stratification of patients to ensure appropriate site-of-care decisions. Clinical risk scores such as pneumonia severity index (PSI) and CURB-65 (confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, age > 65 years), and blood biomarkers of different physiopathological pathways are used in predicting long-term survival in patients with CAP. In a prospective study, patients admitted with CAP were followed for 6 years and Cox regression models as well as area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) were used to investigate associations between initial risk assessment and all-cause mortality (Alan et al. 2015). Initial PSI and CURB-65 scores both had excellent long-term prognostic accuracy, with a step-wise increase in mortality per risk class. The addition of inflammatory (pro-adrenomedullin) and cardiac (pro-atrial natriuretic peptide) blood biomarkers measured upon hospital admission further improved the prognostic capabilities\nof the PSI.",

            "text": "Pathological changes in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) suggest that SARS sequelae are associated with dysregulation of cytokine and chemokine production. A study from Taiwan showed that cytokine or chemokine profiles in patients with SARS differ markedly from those in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and control groups (Chien et al. 2006). Serum levels of three cytokines were significantly elevated in SARS patients versus the CAP: Interferon-\u03b3-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), interleukin (IL)-2, and IL-6. Cytokine levels began to rise before the development of chest involvement and peaked earlier than did lung injury assessed by chest x-ray. Conversely, in CAP patients but not SARS patients or controls, levels of interferon-\u03b3, IL-10, and IL-8 were elevated, and rose in tandem with radiographic changes. A further difference between groups was the ratio of IL-6 to IL-10, at 4.84 in SARS patients versus 2.95 in CAP patients. However, in both sets of patients, levels of IL-6 correlated strongly with the severity of lung injury. The early induction of IP-10 and IL-2, as well as the subsequent overproduction of IL-6 and lack of IL-10, probably contribute to the main immunopathological processes involved in SARS lung injury and may be early biomarkers of lung injury. These findings differ from those observed in subjects with CAP.",

Higher levels of IL-8 and ICAM-1 independently predicted death (McClintock et al. 2008). In addition, lower levels of the coagulation marker protein C were independently associated with an increased risk of death. The association of lower protein C levels with non-survivors continues to support the role for disordered coagulation in ALI/ARDS. These associations exist despite consistent use of lung protective ventilation and persist even when controlling for clinical factors that also impact upon outcomes. The two biomarkers with an independent association with mortality, IL-8 and ICAM-1, need to be be studied further for their potential value in stratifying patients in clinical trials.",

Acute lung injury (ALI) precedes ARDS as severe respiratory illnesses progress. Both conditions can be life-threatening. In a large-scale, multicenter trial of patients with ARDS or ALI, higher levels of nitric oxide (NO) in urine were strongly associated with improved survival, more ventilator-free days, and decreased rates of organ failure (McClintock et al. 2007). The authors speculated that NO has a beneficial effect on ALI since it scavenges oxygen free radicals that are generated during oxidative stress. Since NO increases microcirculation, it helps to better perfuse tissue beds in the lungs. The investigators offered an alternative hypothesis to explain their findings: NO created inside the body may have a beneficial effect on organs other than the lung during ALI. It might help prevent further tissue damage by improving oxygen and nutrient delivery to the tissues, while helping to decrease the amount of toxic oxygen species. The authors also speculated that NO might have antibacterial effects that could be important in infectious conditions that predispose patients to ALI.",

Surfactant proteins A (SP-A)\nand D (SP-D) belong to the collectin family and play pivotal roles in the innate immunity of the lung. Pulmonary collectins directly bind with broad specificities to a variety of microorganism and possess antimicrobial effects. These proteins also exhibit both inflammatory and antiinflammatory functions. The collectins enhance phagocytosis of microbes by macrophages through opsonic and/or non-opsonic activities. The proteins stimulate cell surface expression of phagocytic receptors including scavenger receptor A and mannose receptor. Since the expression of SP-A and SP-D is abundant and restricted within the lung, the proteins are now clinically used as biomarkers for lung diseases. The levels of SP-A and SP-D in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, amniotic fluids, tracheal aspirates and pleural effusions reflect alterations in alveolar compartments and epithelium, and lung maturity. The determination of SP-A and SP-D in sera is a noninvasive and useful tool for understanding some pathological changes of the lung in the diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis, collagen vascular diseases complicated with interstitial lung disease, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome and radiation pneumonitis (Takahashi et al. 2006).",

Levels of placenta growth factor (PlGF), another angiogenic factor, are increased in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of patients with COPD and are inversely correlated with FEV1 (Cheng et al. 2008). Serum levels of PlGF in patients with COPD were more than double those in smokers and nonsmokers without COPD. These findings suggest that bronchial epithelial cells can express PlGF, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of COPD. Both PlGF and VEGF expression levels were increased in cultured bronchial epithelial cells exposed to pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u03b1 and IL-8. Although the mechanisms underlying the observed detrimental effects of PlGF remain to be clarified, persistent PlGF expression might have adverse effects on lung parenchyma by down-regulating angiogenesis.",

Primary bronchial epithelial cell models of rhinovirus infection were used to identify mediators of rhinovirus infection and responded to infection with rhinovirus-16 by releasing high levels of IP-10, RANTES, and IL-16, as well as smaller amounts of IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1. IP-10, perhaps in combination with TNF-\u03b1, might be a useful clinical marker to identify rhinovirus and other virus-induced acute asthma.

However, not all individuals respond to corticosteroids to the same extent and it would be an desirable to be able to predict the response to corticosteroid treatment. Several biomarkers have been assessed following treatment with corticosteroids including measures of lung function, peripheral blood and sputum indices of inflammation, exhaled gases and breath condensates. The most widely examined measures in predicting a response to corticosteroids are airway hyperresponsiveness, exhaled NO (eNO) and induced sputum. Of these, sputum eosinophilia has been demonstrated to be the best predictor of a short-term response to corticosteroids. More importantly, directing treatment at normalizing the sputum eosinophil count can substantially reduce severe exacerbations. The widespread utilization of sputum induction is hampered because the procedure is relatively labor intensive. The measurement of eNO is simpler, but incorporating the assessment of NO in an asthma management strategy has not led to a reduction in exacerbation rates. The challenge now is to either simplify the measurement of a sputum eosinophilia or to identify another inflammatory marker with a similar efficacy as the sputum eosinophil\ncount in predicting both the short- and long-term responses to corticosteroids.",

Furthermore, in patients with severe asthma, TNF-\u03b1 levels were positively correlated with both exhaled nitric oxide and circulating neutrophil counts. Cytokine levels were elevated even though the patients were on high-dose inhaled steroids. This finding might reflect the inability of these drugs to significantly suppress production of this cytokine by airway cellular sources including epithelial cells and inflammatory cells. In patients with severe asthma there may be an imbalance between IL-8 production and the blocking capacity of IL-8 autoantibodies.

A novel nanosensor can detect a possible asthma attack before it begins.
