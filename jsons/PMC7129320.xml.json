Children under 5 years of age are particularly prone, and it is calculated that, in this group, there are more than 700 million cases of acute diarrhea every year [2]. The mortality associated with gastroenteritis has been estimated to be 3-5 million cases per year, the majority of which occur in developing countries [3, 4, 5]. In the developed world, the impact of the illness is seen in its high morbidity and in the high incidence of hospitalization that this illness necessitates [6].",

The core is found inside the inner capsid, and encloses the rotavirus genome, composed of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA. Given the segmented nature of the RNA genome, co-infection of cells with two different strains of rotavirus may result in reassortant virus, with RNA segments from each of the progenitors [25].",

The first, a glycoprotein, determines the G-type specificity, and the second, the P-type specificity, owing to its protease sensitivity. At present, there are 15 G types [29], with G1, G2, G3 and G4 being the predominant ones throughout the world [6]. However, there have been reports of infections by unusual G types [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35], and recently there have been reports of the emergence of serotype G9 in several countries, such as Brazil [32], Malawi [35], the USA [36, 37], France [38], India [39], Argentina [40], the UK [41] and Australia [42].",

The mechanism that induces the production of diarrhea is not well understood, although it appears to be mediated by the relative decrease of villous epithelium absorption in relation to the secretory capacity of the crypt cells [24]. There is also a loss of intestinal permeability to macromolecules such as lactose, secondary to a decrease in disaccharidase in the intestine. The enteric nervous system is stimulated by this virus, leading to the induction of intestinal water and electrolyte secretion [45].",

The protein capsid is composed of 252 capsomers\u2014240 hexones and 12 pentones\u2014and structures called fibers that protrude to the outside. The hexones contain proteins II, VI, VIII, and IX, which participate in the stability and assembly of the viral particle. The pentone proteins (III and IIIa) have the function of cellular penetration, and the fibers are hemagglutinins and are responsible for binding the virus to receptors (Figure 1b) [52, 53, 54]. There are at least eight proteins making up the core [55]; these maintain the integrity of the genome, and participate in enzymatic activity. The genome consists of a linear molecule of double-stranded DNA that represents 15% of the viral mass [53].",

In recent studies, with the application of new assays such as EIA and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), our knowledge of the epidemiology of human calicivirus has changed, especially for Norwalk-type virus [76]. Thus, these viruses are recognized as the main agents responsible for outbreaks of non-bacterial diarrhea, and new estimates suggest that they represent the most common cause of illness with a food origin [143, 144, 145, 146, 147]. Similarly, recent studies investigating calicivirus in sporadic cases of gastroenteritis in children have found that Norwalk-type viruses comprise the second cause of viral gastroenteritis after rotavirus [119, 148, 149, 150].",

Another factor could be the attenuated nature of certain strains, frequently detected in neonates with symptomatic and asymptomatic infections [153, 155, 156]. During the first 2 years of life, repeated rotavirus infections occur, 50% of which are asymptomatic [157, 158, 159]. Several studies have also shown the asymptomatic elimination in feces of adenovirus and astrovirus, and it is calculated that about 50% of infections by calicivirus are asymptomatic [122, 133, 139, 141, 150, 154].",

Nosocomial infections by adenovirus and astrovirus also represent an important problem, as several studies have shown [69, 136, 167, 168]. There are fewer data on the incidence of nosocomial infection due to calicivirus, although in the studies published it is calculated to be high, following group A rotavirus in frequency [130, 167, 169, 170, 171]. The prevalence and transmission of nosocomial infection are accounted for by the many asymptomatic patients who eliminate the virus in feces [57, 172, 173] and the environmental contamination that accompanies the relative resistance of these viruses to normal disinfectants [174, 175].",
