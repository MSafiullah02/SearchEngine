However, with this shift in the limit of viability toward a lower gestational age, the task of protecting the more immature lung from injury becomes increasingly challenging. Extreme prematurity is one of the major risk factors for the development of chronic lung disease of prematurity or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).1 Preterm infants born between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation (ie, extremely preterm) have an immature pulmonary surfactant system, immature airway and vascular architecture, and an underdeveloped surface area for gas exchange (Fig. 1\n).2 Many very preterm infants require prolonged respiratory support to ensure survival, which further increases their risk of developing BPD.",

Stem cells exhibit varying differentiation potencies, and are typically categorized into embryonic and somatic stem cells. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are derived from the early blastocyst and represent the most potent of stem cells owing to their pluripotency (ie, ability to differentiate into cell types derived from all 3 germinal lineages: endoderm, mesoderm, or ectoderm) and their ability for indefinite self-renewal. By contrast, somatic stem cells (also termed adult stem cells [ASCs]) are cells that have assumed increasing degrees of fate restriction and are either multipotent (ie, can differentiate into a limited range of cell types) or unipotent (ie, can generate only one cell type).13 Residual pools of such multipotent or unipotent stem cells are hypothesized to reside in almost all adult organs, and have the ability to contribute to tissue repair and regeneration via repopulation during growth, injury, or disease.",

However, based on the techniques used, there has been some ambiguity regarding the lineage potential23, 31 and contribution of these cells to alveolar repair.32 McQualter and colleagues18 used a multiparameter cell separation strategy and an organotypic in vitro clonogenic assay to detect and characterize a rare population of multipotent adult lung epithelial stem cells that give rise to airway and alveolar epithelial lineages in vitro. More recently, p63-expressing cells in the bronchiolar epithelium have been shown to undergo rapid proliferation after H1N1 influenza virus infection and to radiate to interbronchiolar regions of alveolar ablation. These cells assemble into Krt5+ pods and initiate expression of markers typical of alveoli. Gene-expression profiles of these pods suggest that they are intermediates in the reconstitution of the alveolar-capillary network.33 The presence of such putative endogenous alveolar stem cell populations provides fresh hope of target-directed, regenerative therapies for alveolar diseases.",

Those cells isolated from the tracheal aspirates expressed the markers STRO-1, CD73, CD90, CD105, CD166, CCR2b, CD13, propyl-4-hydroxylase, and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, and were negative for CD11b, CD31, CD34, and CD45.55 Furthermore, these cells were shown to acquire a myofibroblast phenotype, which suggest that they could contribute to the profibrotic changes and arrested alveolarization in BPD.56 However, in contrast to tracheal aspirate MSCs, human bone marrow\u2013derived MSCs did not undergo myofibroblastic differentiation in response to transforming growth factor \u03b21, suggesting distinct properties between these 2 populations of MSCs.56 Indeed, it is possible that these reported resident lung MSCs are perturbed in BPD, as their cell phenotype is not analogous to the endogenous MSCs described by McQualter and colleagues41 in the absence of lung injury. Therefore, with the growing interest in harnessing the therapeutic effects of stem progenitor cells for neonatal lung injury, it is necessary to perform further thorough investigations to understand the behavior of MSCs from different populations (ie, lung, umbilical cord blood [UCB], bone marrow) in the presence and absence of lung injury, and how this could affect potential cell-based therapies for BPD.57\n",

Preterm ECFCs had an increased susceptibility to in vitro oxygen exposure than term ECFCs.58 Borghesi and colleagues59 reported that the number of ECFCs was lower in UCB of preterm infants who subsequently developed BPD, compared with preterm infants who did not develop BPD. In contrast to the findings of Borghesi and colleagues,59 Paviotti and colleagues60 recently reported no association between the number of EPCs at birth and the subsequent development of BPD. The apparent discordance between studies reporting EPCs in preterm infants highlights the importance of appropriately defining an EPC and establishing criteria similar to the \u201cminimal criteria\u201d for characterizing MSCs.61 Furthermore, assessing EPC function may be more revealing than assessing EPC number.",

Various types of stem/progenitor cells have shown benefit in experimental models of neonatal lung injury, with MSCs derived from both bone marrow and UCB being popularly studied, as well as CdM from these cells. However, before safe clinical translation of cell-based therapies is warranted, we must broaden our knowledge and understanding in this novel and exciting area of research. Strong emphasis must be placed on developing and standardizing techniques for stem/progenitor cell definition, isolation, expansion, and therapeutic administration. Experimental studies also need to focus on the long-term outcomes of such therapies. By identifying the most appropriate reparative cell(s) and its source, combined with understanding alternative mechanisms of action beyond cell replacement and assessing the short-term and long-term efficacy and safety, we can advance in the quest of providing therapeutic strategies to prevent and repair neonatal lung injury.",
