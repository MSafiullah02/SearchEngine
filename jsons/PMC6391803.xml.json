Despite active research in sepsis-induced immune dysfunction and immuno-therapy, there are several important gaps between our understanding and practice. First, the time of sepsis-induced immunosuppression remains controversial. Pro- as well as anti-inflammatory may cycle through each phase multiple times over the sepsis course [8, 9]. When the immune system alters during sepsis process needs a rational explanation. Secondly, immune status at the cellular level rather than inflammatory cytokine levels is lack of study, which might differ clinical outcomes. Lastly, the immune status\u2019 alteration after sepsis rather than a single value at a given time point matters [10]. Dynamic adaptive immune status monitor remains lack.",

Th1 cells release mainly proinflammatory cytokine interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 inducing phagocytosis and intracellular killing of microbes while Th2 cells drive specific responses for extracellular pathogens and resolute cell-mediated inflammation by secreting the mainly anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-4. In such cases, Th1 and Th2 cells cross-regulate one another and the balance is important for clearing the infection [11, 12]. The imbalance with Th2 dominant would lead to secondary infections, viral reactivations, and an inability to clear the initial infection, which has been proved in autoimmune diseases [13]. Predominating Th2 in patients with sepsis rather than non-sepsis was proved in Ferguso study [14]. However, the timing of Th2 cell subset predominance and the effect of its dynamic alterations on risk of infection and mortality remains unknown upon sepsis onset. Clarifying its alterations and the relationship with clinical outcomes in severe sepsis will help stratify patients when designing an adaptive immune-targeted therapy in a time-dependent manner.",

Comparisons of characteristics among cohorts, between 28-day survivors and non-survivors, among subgroups according to Th2/Th1 alterations were performed using unpaired t tests, Mann\u2013Whitney U tests, or Chi squared tests, as appropriate. All tests were two-tailed, and a value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Correlations between Th1 populations and plasma INF-\u03b3 levels, and Th2 populations and plasma IL-4 levels were analysed with Pearson correlation test and presented as R square, when R square is more than 0.64 with a p value < 0.05, it would be regarded as a significant correlation.",

Differentiation of surviving CD4 T cells from a pro-inflammatory Th1 cell phenotype to an anti-inflammatory Th2 cell phenotype, which is proposed to be a \u201cprotective\u201d phenotype [30\u201332], turned out to be an impaired antimicrobial response to invading pathogens. There was also a strong trend towards increasing secondary infections in persistently rising Th2/Th1 subgroups. It is possible that increasing susceptibility to secondary infections contributes to the higher mortality in patients with the persistent increase of Th2/Th1. These findings are particularly striking because the optimal host response to sepsis should be to avoid the Th2 cell shift during CD4+ T lymphocyte differentiation and thereby augment Th1 cells.",

Previous studies on INF-\u03b3 and IL-4 have shown elevated serum and plasma levels to be associated with the increase of peripheral Th1 and Th2 populations [33]. However, correlation of plasma levels of INF-\u03b3 and IL-4 and T helper populations of Th1 and Th2 was not apparent in our study, which might be attributed to that plasma cytokines originate from various immune cells. Despite of taking at least 7 h for Th1 and Th2 measurements by flow cytometry, it is a feasible method for evaluating T cell status. Particularly for septic patients with rapid and severe onset, it is worth evaluating T cell subpopulations and identifying which part the uncontrolled and imbalanced host response originates from. More than a single value at a given time point, the dynamic alteration of Th2/Th1 would be strongly recommended to predict risk of ICU-acquired infection and death.",

By including only community-acquired severe sepsis patients without past histories affecting the immune system in septic cohort, we aimed to avoid bias by chronically hospitalization or other underlying impacts on immunological phenotypes. Previous studies have demonstrated independent associations between immunological indicators and poor outcome [34\u201339], but most have largely neglected the potential role of time since sepsis onset. The time of diagnosis or enrolment does not equal to the onset, which might cover the interaction between sepsis process and immune status. To explore the effect of severe sepsis on T helper subpopulations upon its onset, we presented data from previously immunocompetent patients with recordable manifestation or laboratory findings of sepsis-induced organ dysfunction within 24 h, which guaranteed inclusion in the relatively early stage as possible. Unlike the hypothesis of the inflammatory response coming first and immunosuppression following [2, 32], this study with an imbalanced Th2/Th1 as an immunosuppression indicator in severe sepsis supports the concepts that immunosuppression could occur in early sepsis.",

Data collection was limited to variables available during usual care and resulted in an imbalance between groups. Besides, among 338 severe sepsis patients admitted to our centre during 2-year study period, most were excluded for hospital-acquired sepsis, diagnosis of tumour and receipt of chemotherapy or corticosteroid, resulting in enrolling 71 patients, which might bring enrolment bias. Another limitation of this study is that the exact time of severe sepsis onset could not be precisely determined, though we have defined the onset to be the time recordable manifestation or laboratory findings of sepsis-induced organ dysfunction, which was determined by the treating physician and may mask interpretation of timing in this study. Thirdly, T helper subpopulation at the cellular level could only reflect one aspect of immune system, which was focused on in our study and other immune cells like Th17 cells and indicators like related special transcription factors and cytokines might be included in the comprehensive strategy to evaluate the immune status regarding to sepsis.",
