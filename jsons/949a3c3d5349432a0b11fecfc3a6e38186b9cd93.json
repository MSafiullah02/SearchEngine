Again, past results help inform our expectations. The first severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2001-2003 was ultimately contained globally through widespread quarantine measures. During these efforts, longer durations of quarantine were associated with increased reports of distress, as well as symptoms of posttraumatic stress and depression 7 . Add to these effects the potential negative impact of the economic distress that has accompanied the widespread shutdowns during COVID-19, and the consequences for at-risk individuals may be particularly severe.",

Delivering adequate care during disasters and other large-scale traumas is especially challenging. Consider the example of Hurricane Katrina: 8 months after the storm, fewer than 50% of people who developed mood or anxiety disorders received any care; of those who did, 60% had discontinued treatment. Undertreatment was associated with a number of demographic factors, including age, marital status, racial and ethnic minority status, insurance status, and income. 9 This is the crisis we face. The anticipated surge in demand for mental health care could quickly overwhelm capacity, particularly in specialties (such as child psychiatry) or locales (such as rural areas) where an existing shortage of providers is known. Gaps in and barriers to care for many vulnerable populations (including those with serious mental illness, in under-resourced communities, in prison, or who are homeless) are known challenges with unknown solutions.",

Research to understand and improve engagement and continuity of care, including approaches to facilitate (re)connection to care for persons with serious mental disorders who experience disruption in services, is needed.
