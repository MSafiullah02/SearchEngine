            "text": "Population dynamics is a core matter in the modeling of ecological communities, genetics, and epidemics [1] [2] [3] . Combined with the increasing volume of available experimental (big) data, it constitutes a fundamental tool to shed light on the laws governing complex communities of living systems [4] . The traditional approach to population dynamics consists in the analysis of coupled deterministic equations describing the evolution of species abundances in a given community [5] . This procedure-whose outcome is not necessarily simple [6, 7] -is adequate in many cases. However, deterministic approaches neglect the effect of fluctuations, and these are now acknowledged to be both inherent and essential to the organization of communities of living systems [8] . On the one hand, the discreteness and finiteness of populations lead to demographic noise, which has been shown to be responsible for a wealth of nontrivial phenomena, such as the emergence of complex statistical patterns in neutral communities [9, 10] , quasiperiodic oscillations in prey-predator systems [11] , species formation [12] , and others [13] [14] [15] . On the other hand, populations are strongly affected by fluctuations in external conditions [16, 17] , which in most of the cases are highly unpredictable. This source of stochasticity, usually called environmental noise, can have important consequences for, e.g., ecosystem stability [18, 19] and evolutionary dynamics [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] , and fosters species coexistence [25] [26] [27] [28] .",

Owing to this, * hidalgo@pd.infn.it theoretical approaches have to be constructed beyond simple white-noise approximations, i.e., including \"colored\" (timecorrelated) noise [32, 33] . The question of how environmental colored noise affects population extinction has been widely studied in the literature, and there are contrasting positions on whether environmental fluctuations increase or decrease the risk of extinction, as this may actually depend on subtle differences of the underlying dynamics as well as the actual \"color\" of the fluctuations [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . Of particular interest for our analyses here is the remarkable work of Kamenev et al. [40] , who analyzed a logistic growth population-dynamic model in which birth and death rates fluctuate in time, showing that, depending on the interplay between the system size and the temporal scale of the environment, the model exhibits qualitatively different functional dependencies of the mean extinction time with the system size.",

To study this model we employ the so-called \"unified colorednoise approximation,\" which is exact in the limits of very large and very short correlation times [48, 49] , and study the resulting effective (white-noise) problem employing a standard path integral approach; analytical results are tested against direct computational simulations obtained employing a very careful numerical analysis scheme [50] . Using this combined approach, we scrutinize the model phase diagram and identify the parameters for which the population becomes extinct with certainty and those for which the population survives, as well as the threshold separating them, and how the resulting phase transition depends on environmental-noise time correlations. As we will show, the phase diagram becomes much richer in this case than in its noiseless counterpart.",

In the CP (see Fig. 1 ), nodes in a FIG. 1. Single-species dynamics with extinction. (a) A community of individuals grow under limited conditions with the dynamics of the contact process running on any given network. Each of the N nodes in the network can be either occupied by up to one individual (active node) or remain empty (inactive node). Individuals can reproduce at empty neighboring nodes at rate \u03bb and also die and be removed from the community at rate \u03bc. (b) The model exhibits different behaviors depending on parameter values: for low values of the reproduction rate, birth processes do not compensate deaths, and any population becomes extinct in the long term (absorbing phase). After a threshold value, population density exhibits a nonzero stationary value (active phase). Both regimes are separated by a critical point of a continuous phase transition. (c) However, any finite population eventually becomes extinct due to demographic fluctuations. Phases can be then distinguished looking at the scaling of the mean-extinction time with the system size, which is logarithmic in the absorbing phase and exponential in the active phase, while it becomes a power-law just at the critical point. (d) In the simplest scenario, the rate at which individuals reproduce (and similarly for the death rate) can be considered as a constant parameter (blue line).

Still, it is possible to characterize the phases of a finite population by the mean time to reach extinction, T , as a function of the system size, N . Different functional dependencies emerge for each of the phases of the CP [43, 55] (see Fig. 1 ): T scales logarithmically with the system size in the absorbing phase (\u03bb < \u03bb c ), while it increases exponentially in the active phase (\u03bb > \u03bb c )-meaning that extinctions become extremely rare for sufficiently large populations in the active phase-and scales as a power-law right at the critical point, \u03bb = \u03bb c . Thus, in a nutshell, the CP represents a prototypical paradigm to analyze single-species communities with extinction. Such a dynamics can be characterized by means of (i) the phase diagram, which describes the stationary state of the system as a function of the parameters, (ii) the critical point, representing the extinction threshold, and (iii) the scaling of the mean-extinction time with the system size, as a proxy for population stability. In the next section we analyze how time-correlated environmental noise changes each of these elements and how this depends on the environmental auto-correlation time.",

This last regime implies that when there are extremely long periods of adverse external conditions (as compared, using adequate rescaling units, with system size) the system reaches deterministically the absorbing state regardless its size. Let us notice that this situation is not accessible to our approach, as we set the system in the asymptotic limit of large N (where demographic effects can be neglected), and thus \u03c4 cannot be much larger than it.
