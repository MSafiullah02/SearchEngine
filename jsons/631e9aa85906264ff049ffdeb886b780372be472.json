A model of the bacteria-induced acute lung infl ammation was used to study its effect on lung metastasis in mice. Acute lung infection dramatically increased cancer cell homing to the lung and lung metastasis.

Antifungal drugs are often given prophylactically to patients with persistent fever, and are shown to decrease mortality rates (Johansen and Gotzsche 2014 ) . Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylactically administered before chemotherapy regimens has been shown to be effective in prevention of Pneumocystis pneumonia in children with solid tumors, leukemias and lymphomas (Caselli et al. 2014 ). However, caution in the choice of primary and secondary antifungal prophylaxis is recommended. The use of secondary prophylaxis may reduce systemic fungal infection frequency but at the same time increase the risk of colonization and infection with azole-resistant fungal strains (Gedik et al. 2014 ) . Since it has been demonstrated that prolonged duration of neutropenia is one of the risk factors for onset of invasive Aspergillosis, addition of granulocytecolony-stimulating factor into therapeutic and prophylactic protocols is recommended (van de Peppel et al. 2014 ).",

Despite the signifi cant advances in management of pediatric cancer and infl uenza, the epidemiology and outcomes of infl uenza in pediatric oncology patients have not altered over the past several decades (Carr et al. 2012 ) . Although infl uenza usually presents as a mild illness, children with hematological conditions and solid tumors are at increased risk for complications, which may lead to delay in anticancer therapy and increase in hospitalization and antibiotic usage (Ozdemir et al. 2011 ) . Though infl uenza is the most common viral infection , is only one on the long list of viruses, such as H1N1, rhinovirus, parainfl uenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human parechovirus, bocavirus, metapneumovirus, and human coronavirus occurring in about 30 % of neutropenic pediatric patients.

In light of these negative impacts together with rising antibiotic resistance, development of preventive approaches to preclude the almost inevitable infectious complications, especially in neutropenic patients, is highly desirable. Need for infection prophylaxis is also growing in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients. Due to overall improvement of this treatment during the last two decades the survival duration has increased but the incidence of post-transplantation infections, particularly those caused by respiratory viruses, has concomitantly increased with lifespan.

Both are comprised of two functionally distinct populations: cells promoting immunity and those sustaining immune tolerance. Within T cells the functional subtypes can be easily identifi ed as T effector and T regulatory (Treg) cells, respectively. Classifi cation of different subgroups among dendritic cells is much more complicated. Originally DCs were discovered as cells of myeloid origin with mainly antigen-presenting function and thus as cells which promote mechanisms in adaptive immunity (Steinman 1991 ) . Later it was recognized that depending on the DCs' maturation status (Steinman et al. 2003 ) , hematopoietic lineage of origin (Ma et al. 2012 ) and expression of co-stimulatory and MHC molecules they can play either immunostimulatory or tolerogenic, immunosuppressive roles (Hurwitz and Watkins 2012 ; Zhong et al. 2014 ). In addition, the change from immunostimulatory to tolerogenic status can be induced in DCs via different mechanisms by a number of malignancies. Also, it should be taken into consideration that over 60 % of malignancies arise in older populations, and hence the age-related decline in their hematopoietic cells' ability for self-renewal also contributes to an immunocompromised condition in cancer patients over 65 years old (Lipschitz 1995 ; Balducci et al. 2001 ; Shurin et al. 2007 ) .",

With the onset of malignancy complicated networks of expression in the ligand/receptor axis and changes in signal transduction lead to alteration of the functional profi les of the DC subpopulations. This has a twofold outcome. On one hand it is part of the tumors defense mechanism, protecting the malignant mass from immune reactions and allowing its unhindered growth. On the other hand, the tolerogenic function of the DCs leads to generalized immunosuppression , which contributes to the onset of infectious diseases . During the last decade new insights into particular mechanisms contributing to the tumor-induced changes in DC function and the resultant increased susceptibility to infectious diseases were reported. They include both local and systemic mechanisms employed by the tumor to affect the DCs functions. Collectively they result in the inhibition of the DCs differentiation from hematopoietic progenitors (Shurin et al. 2001 ; Tourkova et al. 2004 ; Hargadon 2013 ) and changes in their phenotype and function (Zhong et al. 2014 ; Aalamian-Matheis et al. 2007 ; Karthaus et al. 2012 ; Chao et al. 2015 ) .",

They could either be part of robust anti-tumor immunity (Esche et al. 1998 ; Iida et al. 2008 ) or they may play an essential role in tumor immune escape (Zhong et al. 2014 ; Wu et al. 2014 ; Dudek et al. 2013 ) . DC phenotyping is a valuable tool in defi ning their maturation and functional status. Multiple groups have reported data contributing to an optimal phenotyping panel of markers for tolerogenic/regulatory DC in cancer . It was shown that in prostate cancer expression of CD83, CD86 and CD40 co-stimulatory molecules are decreased (Aalamian-Matheis et al. 2007 ) . It was also reported that evaluation of the tumor-infi ltrating DCs should be performed utilizing a larger panel including not only S-100 and CD1a, but also DC-SIGN, and DC-LAMP markers (Karthaus et al. 2012 ). Detection of DC-SIGN is of importance because it is an intercellular adhesion molecule which can interact with carbohydrate structures on some cancer cells. This interaction leads to immunosuppressive responses in DCs via inhibition of their maturation (Chao et al. 2015 ) . Also it was suggested that different levels of expression of the MHC and co-stimulatory molecules have representative patterns for different subsets of regulatory DCs (Zhong et al. 2014 ) .",

Evidence is mounting in support of their contribution to the processes of oncogenesis. A growing number of cancers have been shown to possess the ability to utilize different mechanisms attracting Treg cells and utilizing them in defense against immune reactions in an affected individual. The role of the Treg cells in enhancing the morbidity in cancer -associated infections is via local and generalized immunosuppression mechanisms. The traffi cking patterns of the Treg cells can be altered by the tumorsecreted cytokines and chemokine molecules inducing their recruitment into the vicinity of the tumor and providing a malignant mass with 'a shield' that suppresses the anti-tumor immune responses. This allows for uninhibited tumor growth and also results in compromised anti-infection immunity. Among the list of this cohort of tumors are ovarian carcinoma (Curiel et al. 2004 ) , breast tumors (Gobert et al. 2009 ), mesothelioma (Hegmans et al. 2006 ) , Hodgkin lymphoma (Ishida et al. 2006 ) , myelodysplastic syndromes (Kotsianidis et al. 2009 ), gastric cancers (Mizukami et al. 2008 ; Ohtani et al. 2009 )., the malignant plural mesothelioma and effusions (Qin et al. 2009 ; Shimizu et al. 2009 ), and lung adenocarcinoma (Wald et al. 2006 ) . CCL22, CCR4, CXCL9, CXCR4, CCR5, CXCL12 and CCL17 are among the chemokine molecules with altered expression which were reported to contribute to distorted traffi cking patterns of Treg cells in cancer.",

The effectiveness of Treg cell depletion in the regression of oral fi brosarcoma with an increase in survival was demonstrated utilizing a mouse model. Anti-CD25 Ab administration resulted in depletion of the Tregs and a complete regression of tumor (Whelan et al. 2014 ). The following studies proposed further modifi cations in the use of anti-CD25 Abs. It was shown that targeting the CD25 Low subset assures the discerning depletion of the Treg cells among other CD25+ T cell populations (Weiss et al. 2012 ) . CD73 is a cell surface enzyme that suppresses immunity. The adoptive experiments in the Treg-defi cient mice have demonstrated that protumorogenic effects of Treg cells depend on the expression of CD73. In vivo blockade of CD73 with a selective inhibitor or anti-CD73 mAb reduced tumor growth and metastasis (Stagg et al. 2011 ) . Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and TGF-\u03b2 play a role in induction of Treg cells. Interrupting the TGF-\u03b2 and PGE2 signaling pathways was suggested as an alternative approach for reduction of the tumor protective function of Treg cells (Baratelli et al. 2010 ) . Interest in adaptation of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation for cancer therapy lead to the fi nding that migration of MSCs to the sites of tumor growth, which produced inhibition of Stat3 signaling, was associated with normalization of Treg numbers and dramatically reduced pulmonary and hepatic metastases (Ling et al. 2010 ) . Foxp3 is an X-linked nuclear transcription factor that is considered a defi ning marker for the Treg population (Sakaguchi 2004 ; Hori et al. 2003 ) .",

The mechanisms evoking the immunocompromised condition in cancer of both origins and those contributing to higher incidence and more aggressive course of infectious complications in this group of patients are complex and interconnected. The highest risk for onset of infectious complications and associated morbidity and mortality is seen in patients receiving chemotherapy for treatment of hematologic malignancies. A common occurrence for these patients is development of neutropenia, which is due to chemically induced suppression of hemopoiesis already compromised by malignancy. Ironically, in some cases the incidence of infections has concomitantly increased with a lifespan prolonged due to successful anti-cancer therapy. Thus, the ultimate goal of discerning the dichotomy of chemotherapy-mediated anti-cancer and immunosuppressive effects is of direct impact on management of infections in these patients. It is especially important in light of increased antibiotic resistance. New insight in the DC and Treg cell-mediated reactions leading to morbidity in cancer patients with infectious complications permits development of novel target-specifi c immunomodulatory therapeutic approaches.",
