The overall success of a digitized public-procurement function yields progress and economic growth for the nation. In this research, we analyze the potential of blockchainbased systems to enhance effectiveness, ease, and transparency in public procurement in the case of Nigeria and identify the current challenges facing public procurement, i.e., lack of trust and transparency among critical stakeholders in the procurement process, systems that only weakly support transaction recording and documentation, complex process structures, corruption in institutions involved in the procurement process. To address these issues, a blockchain-based framework is developed to enable interoperability of information-systems involved in the procurement process, increase citizen participation in eliciting project requirements and to enable a more transparent project monitoring and auditing. We apply the framework to a case study with respect to identifying onchain activities that enable system interoperability, e-participation and project auditability.",

These features render blockchains a veritable choice for a secured and trusted system in business applications. The framework is presented as a set of recommendations in Table 1 . Three recommendations are presented and each recommendation is associated to a problem category. The first recommendation addresses the issue of corruption in existing processes due to the absence of interoperability in the systems that support the current procurement process. The proposed framework recommends using blockchain-enabled smart contracts [18] to facilitate interoperability of current systems.

Once, the tender boards then approve the budget, a call for tender is placed in the news dailies for potential contractors. Otherwise, the budget is sent to the Bureau of Public Procurement. Once the latter receives the budget, they perform further reviews and approve if a budget is within their approval limits. Otherwise, the proposal is sent to the Federal Executive Council for further consideration and approval. Once there is an approval for the project to be executed, a call for tender is issued on national dailies and contractors are expected to submit their bids.

An indepth analysis reveals the underlying structural-and communication issues. On this basis, we recommend an implementation framework that aims at interoperability of all the silo systems of the involved organizations. Thus, all assets associated with crucial tasks are stored on a blockchain and accessed via the collaborating parties -creating more openness, transparency and trust. As a further outcome, we discover that the current procurement process does not adequately support citizen engagement. For this issue, we propose an additional on-chain activity so that citizens can vote on project requirements that are prioritized during the call for a tender stage. Finally, we seek to find answers to the important aspects of project monitoring, evaluation and auditability. Our respondents mention that most of the budgeted projects are only poorly executed, or not completed at all. With respect to this, we propose an additional on-chain activity that renders the evaluation of the completed projects more democratic and transparent -by giving citizens access to track projects based on the tender requirements and allowing them to give feedback about the success, or failure based on these requirements.",
