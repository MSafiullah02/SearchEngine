SARS coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV), a previously unrecognized coronavirus, was discovered by the etiological agent of the disease,1, 2, 3, 4 which encodes all the sequences of functional proteins required for viral replication and transcription. It is also known that the functional polypeptides are released from polyprotein by extensive proteolytic processing, primarily by the SARS coronavirus main protease (SARS Mpro). This protease, with a chymotrypsin fold, has similarity with the coronavirus main protease in sharing the cleavage specificity for glutamine at substrate P1 site.5, 6 For the functional importance of SARS Mpro in the viral life cycle, it becomes an attractive target in drug development directly against SARS disease.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 However, presently, neither a vaccine nor an efficacious therapy is available. So, it is still urgent to design the potential therapeutic agents against SARS.",

Since any mutation or deletion of these residues involving the interactions have resulted in an inactive enzyme,14, 19 these interactions are vital to maintain the active conformation of SARS Mpro dimer and might be the ultimate reasons for the activity differences between dimer and monomer, which can be treated as new targets for the drug design against SARS\u2010CoV.

The dihedral angle CA\u2010CB\u2010CG\u2010CD2 of His41 averages 73.4\u00b0 and the averaged distance between NE2 of His41 and SG of Cys145 is 3.72 \u00c5, indicating the presence of a weak hydrogen bond [occupancy of 36.4%, shown in Fig. 4(c)]. In the crystal structure, a water molecule entrapped by Asp187 and His41 shields Asp187 from the catalytic dyad of SARS Mpro [Fig. 4(a,b)]. However, an interesting phenomenon found in the MD simulation is that the distance between ND1 of His41 and OE2 of Asp187 averages 2.79 \u00c5, supporting the presence of a stable hydrogen bond with occupancy of 83.2% (Table I). Monitoring the orientation of the His41 flip by the dihedral angel CG\u2010CB\u2010CA\u2010N, it is shown that this angle remains nearly constantly around 58.2\u00b0 during the MD simulation of the dimer complex. In contrast to the angle of \u223c90\u00b0 in crystal structure, the imidazole ring of His41 turns toward Asp187. This turn helps to form a stable hydrogen bond between His41 and Asp187 [Fig. 4(c)]. So, it can be seen from the MD simulation that, in solution, when the active pocket of SARS Mpro combines with substrate, to bind substrate tightly and hydrolyze it efficiently, His41 might regulate itself to turn toward Asp187 and squeeze the water molecule out, thus converting the catalytic site from the dyad (His41 and Cys145) to a more efficient catalytic triad (His41, Cys145, and Asp187). Although it still has not been confirmed by experiment, it can be hypothesized that the catalytic efficiency of the SARS Mpro is regulated by substrate binding, which is in accordance with the results found in the MD simulations of SARS Mpro modeled by homology complexed with its designed substrate22 and is helpful in inhibitor design for SARS Mpro.",

This prevents His170 competing with His163 and forming H\u2010bond with Tyr161 and maintains the stable hydrogen bond between Tyr161 and His163. Furthermore, the N\u2010terminus of the counter monomer interacts directly with Phe140, making the conformation of the phenyl ring of Phe140 stable and stack onto the imidazole ring of His163. Just for these two interactions, the imidazole ring of His163 can maintain the conformation required for donating the proton to bind glutamine at the substrate analog P1 site. The N\u2010terminus of the counter monomer also forms a stable hydrogen bond with Glu166, which stabilizes the proper conformation of the side chain carbonate group of Glu166 required for accepting a hydrogen bond from glutamine at the substrate analog P1 site. His163 and Glu166 form the \u201ctooth\u201d conformation characteristics and result in the specificity for glutamine at the substrate P1 site. While in the monomer, because of the lack of the stabilization of the N\u2010terminus of the counter monomer to His163 and Gly166, the \u201ctooth\u201d conformation is destroyed, resulting in a destruction of the specific recognition of the glutamine of the substrate at the P1 site and the inactivation of monomer. Furthermore, it is the lack of the stabilization of the N\u2010terminus of the counter monomer to Phe140 that makes the loop 140\u2013146 move a lot toward the active site, which causes the collapse of the \u201coxyanion hole\u201d and leaves no space to accommodate glutamine at the substrate analog P1 site and a tetrahedral intermediate. Because of the loss of the salt\u2010bridge between the N\u2010terminus of counter monomer and domain III and the specific electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between domain III of monomers within the dimer, the conformation of domain III cannot be fixed. As a consequence, the loop 184\u2013197 becomes disorder and the S3 pocket collapses, leaving no space to accommodate the threonine at the substrate analog P3 site. The movements of loop 140\u2013146 and loop 184\u2013197 toward the active site induce the reduction of substrate\u2010binding pocket. As a consequence, the SARS Mpro monomer cannot bind the substrate. In the dimer, the distance between NE2 of His41 and SG of Cys145 averages 3.72 \u00c5, which agrees well with the experimental observations made by X\u2010ray crystallography.
