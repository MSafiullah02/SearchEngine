Two months after the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan city, the oil price triggered a spectacular fall by around 30% (20% for the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil), which is the largest slump since the Gulf war, after the unexpected decision of Saudi authorities to offer price discounts of 6$ to 8$ to their main customers in Europe, Asia, and the US. These two serious shocks have triggered the worldwide stock markets to free fall as a result of the oil price war and fears over the dramatic news of infections and patient deaths cases coming especially from Italy, France and Spain. The study by Aloui et al. (2011) found that countries with higher sensitivity to commodity-price changes tend to co-move closely with the US in both bullish and bearish markets. Thus, by analysis of the impact of COVID-19 and oil shock on the US market, we can provide useful insights for the contagion and spillover effect studies in other countries and regions, contributing to this large and important research area.",

It is a first endeavor to analyze the connectedness and the leadlag interplay between the COVID-19, oil price, EPU and stock market in the US within a time-frequency-based approach. To achieve this task, we resort to the wavelet methods. Specifically, we implement the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and wavelet coherence (WC) as well as the wavelet-based causality tests to recent US data. At least three foremost aspects arouse the use of the wavelets. First, the wavelet method allows us to analyze the association between the selected variables within the time-scales and frequency bands (i.e.",

Bad news may induce short-term traders to sell, while long-run traders may perceive the same news as a buying opportunity with the perception that such news would have a transitory bearing on the market (Chakrabarty et al., 2015) .",

Based on that, we hypothesize that the association between the novel COVID-19 pandemic news, oil price volatility, US stock market and EPU will vary across time-scales and frequency bands.

In a recent study using Google research data, Fetzer et al. (2020) unveiled a rapid increase of economic anxiety during and after the initial global spread of the Coronavirus. They report substantial nonlinearity in the COVID-19 spread and an overestimation of the mortality and its contagiousness effects. Here, we hypothesize the nonlinear effect which may be also attributed to the investors\" heterogeneous expectations across short and long-run investment horizons. Third, the timeliness of data is a critical practical issue. We acknowledge that this paper is one of the first studies on COVID-19, and only a short period of data can be collected. To estimate the current and the future time-frequency causalities between COVID-19, EPU, stock returns and oil researchers would need long period data to get high statistical inference from the used tests, which makes the majority of traditional econometrics techniques not appropriate for the current study. Therefore, in this paper, we use the wavelet method since it is not affected by the size of the data sample. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 discusses the prior research in this area used to build theoretical arguments of this paper. Section 3 explains the data and methodology employed in this study.

The GPR index is an index based on news related to geopolitical events. It mirrors outcomes taken from automated text-search of the electronic archives which captures eleven national and international newspapers selected by above authors. The number of words related to geopolitical risk are counted each day in each newspaper to calculate daily GPR index 9 . Afterward, the entire index is normalized by equating the average value corresponding to the 2000-2009 decade to 100 (for details, see Caldara and Iacoviello (2018) . At least three foremost aspects are motivating the use of the US-EPU and the US-GPR. First, using these indexes, we can assess the impact of the combined COVID-19 and oil prices on the US-economic policy uncertainty and the USgeopolitical risk within time-scales and frequency bands. Secondly, we deem that the GPR index is more relevant than the EPU index since the latter is more designed based on selected words related to US economic, uncertainty or others related to legislation or regulation. However, the GPR index includes words related to geopolitical tensions and other adverse geopolitical extreme events. Finally, using the two indexes, allows us to conduct comparative analysis in terms of responses to the oil and COVID-19 shocks.

The US market seems to react to bad news coming from Wuhan city, December, 31 st , the Chinese sanitary authorities announced the first patient death and a few days later, researchers identified the new unknown dangerous virus and the first death was recorded on January 11. At the same time, some infected cases were identified in South Korea, Japan and the US. Moreover, another high coherency area is identified on mid-February corresponding to some COVID-19 pandemic bad news such as the reported first patient death in the US on February, 28 th , the number of global cases raised to 87,000 and the high-level warning announced by the US authorities. The last substantial coherence is identified at the end of the sample period and may be mainly due to the combined effect of the sharp drop of oil prices and COVID-19 fears. Furthermore, arrows are mostly turned down and left which means that there is an anti-cyclic J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 14 effect between COVID-19 and US stock index where COVID-19 is leading. We identify a quite similar configuration in terms of islands of strong coherencies in Fig. 3d showing the coherence between the reported COVID-19 cases and the US EPU. However, we perceive that the COVID-19 outbreak has a greater effect on the US economic uncertainty. The red islands identified at the beginning and the end of the sample period correspond to lower frequencies (8 to 16 days-frequency bands) which means that it is expected to have a longterm negative effect on the US economic uncertainty. The uncertainty is primarily related to the long-term path of the US economy and how the Federal Reserve will react to the notable rise of uncertainty and bad news of the COVID-19. This is in addition to an adverse impact on the potential US output and unemployment rate that are quite independent from the monetary policy. ",

As for the connectedness between the US stock index and EPU, (Fig. 3c) The oil-EPU connectedness over time-scales and frequencies is shown in Fig 3f. , it is evident that the US economic policy uncertainty is strongly affected by the recent oil price. Indeed, a strong island of red color is identified starting from the beginning of March 2020 over the 16-days investment horizon corresponding to the unexpected price discount announced by Saudi Arabia. In addition, the arrows are mostly turned down to the left implying that there is an anti-cyclic relationship between US economic uncertainty and oil prices where economic uncertainty leading to lower oil prices. Fig. 3g shows the wavelet coherence plot between the US-COVID-19 and the GPR. The visual inspection of the wavelet shows the existence of huge zones of high coherence located at the beginning of the sample period over two frequency bands (4-days and from 8 to16days), matching with the onset of the new infectious disease and the arrival of bad news from China. Another two islands of red color are identified at the end of February over the 6-8-days and up to 16-days frequency bands. Indeed, at the last day of February, only 15 infected cases were announced by the US Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) but two weeks later, the country\"s testing capacity increased and more than 17,000 positive cases are identified during the first two weeks of march. When referring to the arrows, we perceive that most of them are turned right and down which implies that the causality is going from the Coronavirus pandemic to the US-GPR during the month of March. The tremendous spread of the COVID-19 has significantly affected the US-GPR levels. As for the dependence between the oil and US-GPR (Fig, 3h) , the wavelet plot is extremely edifying. We identify strong areas of strong dependence at the inception and at the end of the sample period. At the beginning of the sample period areas are covering the 4-8 days\" frequency while those located at the end of the period are over the 8-16 days.

From these results, we notice that unsurprisingly oil price volatility is causing the US stock index for all the selected frequencies. This result is in line with previous studies showing the substantial sensitivity of the US market to oil volatility shocks (see, among recent studies, Torun et al., 2020 and Wu et al., 2020) . The effect of the EPU on the US stock market is evidenced over very short-run investment horizons (D1 to D2). Furthermore, the wavelet-based causality is running from the COVID-19 pandemic to the US stock market and the EPU for only the D1 and D2 frequency domains. It is worthily noting that the COVID-19 is not causing the US-GPR risk levels over all the selected frequency bands, while it affects the US-EPU over only the D1 and D2 time-horizons. This result may be due to the US investors who perceive the COVID-19 outbreak firstly as an economic crisis rather that reverse geopolitical event. No significant effect of the COVID-19 is detected on the oil price volatility over the remaining frequency domains since the two exogenous shocks are independent.",

It is becoming clear that the COVID-19 pandemic is causing outcome disruption, an exceptional increase in the US economic policy uncertainty and unprecedented response of the stock market. While the oil volatility shocks may be sensed as a transitory risk that could be depressed through the OPEC+ deals, the COVID-19 crisis can further affect oil price due to the travel restrictions around the world during the pandemic. This result is important not only for oil exploration and production companies, but for companies in transportation and hospitality industries, as well as investors who have allocations in the stocks sensitive to the oil price and commodity derivatives. The US investors\" perceived risk inherent to the tumultuous spread of the COVID-19 as a systematic risk shaking the US stock market raising the economic policy uncertainty indexes to enormous levels. This result is consistent with a recent survey study outcome of the World Economic Forum (March, 2020) 10 . Therefore, the US government must avoid creating additional uncertainty by designing a coherent COVID-19 economic strategy that fosters J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f opening the markets. From an asset management perspective, our results show the strong short-term impact of COVID-19 on the US stock markets, however, we cannot exclude the possibility that investors might still expect that with the further government interventions, the US stock markets will be able to recover in the long-term. In the meantime, while the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing, asset managers and individual investors should know how to handle stock market volatility and systematic risk associated with COVID-19 spread. The used risk management framework should be reassessed to address the new and enhanced risks caused by the upsurge of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The CWT plot is in line with the time path of the EPU index reported inFig.1.

When inspecting to the US-GPR, we observe that the CWT plot is a mixture of the CWTs of oil prices and the US-COVID-19 counts, which indicates that the unprecedented increase of the geopolitical risk levels in the US is driven by the combined shocks of the novel infectious disease and the recent free fall of oil prices. Furthermore, we identify huge island of red color corresponding to a substantial volatility jumps by the end of February, 2020 when the US-GPR plunges from 559 points at the beginning of the month to go under 100 points and at the same date the oil prices dropped and the COVID-19 curve started its exponential trend, as it was demonstrated inFig.1.details seeCaldara and Iacoviello, 2018).",
