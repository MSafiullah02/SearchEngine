It has been a companion to the human species since our inception, before we started our long journey out of Africa 60.000 years ago, and has shaped our population, genetics, and behaviors like no other organism [1, 2] . Malaria presentation ranges from a mild febrile illness to a life-threatening disease with multisystem organ failure. Severe malaria belongs in the intensive care unit due to the multitude of potential complications, remaining a major cause of mortality worldwide. In the context of a globalized community and changing climate, borders' relevance is ever decreasing. Critical care providers familiar with this disease will be equipped to deliver timely and appropriate care in the face of this changing epidemiology.",

These motile sporozoites are inoculated, circulate to the liver, and actively infect hepatocytes, causing asymptomatic liver infection ( Fig. 13.3 ). Once they invade hepatocytes, they will mature over 7-10 days to produce schizonts. These schizonts rupture, releasing thousands of merozoites into the 1974 1976 1978 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 Year bloodstream that quickly invade erythrocytes, beginning the asexual erythrocyte stage ( Fig. 13.3 ). Merozoites develop into trophozoites that will become schizonts over a period of 48 h in the cases of P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. ovale, 72 h in the cases of P. malariae, and 24 h in the case of P. knowlesi. Schizonts will then rupture, causing hemolysis and releasing many merozoites with every cycle causing clinical illness. Some erythrocytic parasites will develop into sexual gametocytes. When taken up by the mosquito, a female and a male gametocyte have the capability of fusing to produce a zygote. After multiple steps, sporozoites are generated in the anopheline salivary glands, completing the cycle. P. vivax and P. ovale generate hypnozoites in the liver that can lead to recurrent disease months or years after the initial infection ( Fig. 13.3 ).",

Erythrocytes that are infected with more mature stages of this parasite remain within small tissue vessels, including the brain. This process is termed cytoadherence, and it is thought to be caused by the expression of Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (Pfemp1) in the erythrocyte membrane. Parasites avoid passing through the spleen where abnormal erythrocytes would be cleared while also being more likely to cause local tissue damage. This protein is member of the var family and continuously changes among more than 60 subtypes, impairing antigen recognition and host response [23, 24] . Moreover, subtypes of Pfemp1 may confer tissue specificity, as is the case with the affinity to endothelial protein C receptor and cerebral malaria [25] . The severity of disease is associated with both the increased parasitemia and a higher biomass of sequestered parasites [26] . Reinforcing a previously made point, P. falciparum's life cycle requires a yeararound transmission to survive, only possible in regions of the world with a high endemic rate. Given their capability to develop into hypnozoites, P. vivax and P. ovale can inhabit subtropical areas with marked seasonal patterns, remaining dormant until optimal conditions are met.",

However, thick blood smears do not allow identification of erythrocyte morphology, helpful in species diagnosis, and are difficult for those with limited training. Giemsa-stained thin blood smear offers an improved means of characterizing parasite morphology, but the process is much less efficient than for thick smears. As such, thick smear is standard of care in areas of high endemic burden, while thin are reserved for areas in which there is more trained personnel, with more time available to them.

Chloroquine quickly became one of the most important drugs ever developed against an infectious agent [40] . It is key to understand this in the context of the discovery of DDT and other vector control measures. Optimism was such that WHO launched an eradication campaign in 1955. Although we fell short and it had to be cancelled on 1969, the extraordinary impact that chloroquine had in vulnerable areas like the sub-Saharan Africa is undeniable [40, 41] . Its widespread use was not without consequence. P. falciparum initially found to develop resistance in the 1950s-1960s in foci in Colombia and Southeast Asia [42] . Resistance steadily spread during the 1960s, finally getting to Africa in the 1980s [42] .
