The EP field has witnessed rapid expansion in the number of therapeutic procedures treating a wide range of arrhythmias and in the new technologies available to perform these procedures. Because of the increasing complexity of equipment and procedures and an ever-expanding knowledge base, it was concluded that the field would benefit from a consensus document that would define the critical components and processes of a modern EP laboratory. To this end, the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) convened a multidisciplinary team to review EP laboratory design, ergonomics, personnel, equipment, occupational hazards, and patient safety, as well as clinical and ethical issues related to diagnostic and therapeutic EP procedures. The goal is to provide physicians, administrators, and regulatory personnel with the recommended requirements for building, staffing, and running a modern EP laboratory to optimize patient outcomes, minimize patient risk, and provide a safe and positive environment for physicians and staff.",

Clinical EP laboratories emerged in the late 1960s, and by the early 1970s, formal fellowships had been established and EP laboratories were taking shape. First-generation EP laboratories often shared space with cardiac catheterization laboratories and were typically subordinate to coronary angiographic and hemodynamic procedures. When a space was dedicated for electrophysiological testing, it was often small, and fluoroscopy was delivered with portable C-arm units. These laboratories were sufficient for diagnostic EP studies and electropharmacological testing. Second-generation EP laboratories developed in the 1980s with the introduction of catheter ablation and cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) to the electrophysiologist\u2019s armamentarium. Pacemaker implantation was shifting from the domain of surgery to that of cardiac EP. With increasingly complex procedures being performed in EP laboratories, more space was allocated to new dedicated laboratories and fluoroscopy equipment began to be upgraded to systems commensurate with those used in cardiac catheterization laboratories.",

Freestanding EP laboratories can be privately owned, and when owned by physicians, there may be concerns about conflicts of interest (as discussed in Section 12). This arrangement presents challenges that stem from the separation of the laboratory from vital hospital services. In the event of a life-threatening complication, such as pericardial tamponade2 or endovascular tear during lead extractions,3 an emergency response from certain hospital-based services such as cardiothoracic surgery can become necessary, and even possibly lifesaving. Performing EP procedures in freestanding EP laboratories on patients with clinical conditions that confer increased risk are relatively contraindicated. These include preexisting advanced heart failure and severe left ventricular dysfunction4; recent myocardial infarction, recent stroke, chronic kidney disease, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, and severe/morbid obesity5; and severe valvular dysfunction or prosthetic heart valve, CHD (including atrial septal defect repair), active oral anticoagulation, advanced age, and pediatric age. Procedures that necessitate lesion creation close to coronary arteries, such as aortic cusp ablation6 and epicardial ablation,7 carry a higher risk of intraprocedural myocardial infarction and should not be performed outside a hospital. As part of the consent process, patients should be informed that the procedure is being performed without on-site surgical backup. In order to ensure the safety of a patient undergoing a procedure in a freestanding EP laboratory, a functional and tested system must be in place to quickly transfer patients to a hospital with immediate surgical support in case of an unanticipated complication. The receiving program should be familiar with complications unique to the EP laboratory. There must be a standing agreement between the laboratory and the receiving hospital so that there is no unnecessary delay in the transfer process.",

A \u201cclosed EP laboratory\u201d is commonly present in academic institutions and limits physician practice to faculty members of the particular institution or university. In contrast, \u201copen EP laboratories\u201d allow credentialing and the participation of multiple physician groups, including those who do not hold faculty level appointments. Such laboratory structuring is common in community and private institutions and is also present in some academic settings. Whether an EP laboratory is open or closed is determined by the institution\u2019s leadership on the basis of economic, historical, political, and geographical factors that are often beyond physician control. An inherent difficulty in the open EP laboratory format lies in procedure scheduling for multiple physicians; a centralized scheduling structure that can arrange scheduling while organizing and prioritizing procedures on the basis of urgency and acuity is important to avoid conflicts and optimize patient care.",

Anesthesia support is desirable for the safe performance of potentially lengthy and complex procedures. The role of anesthesia services in the EP laboratory is detailed in Section 6. Surgery backup must be immediately present for lead extraction procedures in which a lead to be removed is older than 1 year (or require tools other than a standard stylet to be removed if younger than 1 year from implantation)8, and mapping/ablation procedures require pericardial access. Complex ablation procedures, such as atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation, should be performed only in hospitals equipped and prepared to manage these types of emergencies, with access to emergency surgical support when required. Finally, high-risk procedures in critically ill patients, such as ablation of VT in patients requiring hemodynamic support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, can only be safely performed in institutions offering comprehensive programs with active engagement from electrophysiologists, surgeons, and anesthesiologists. Although such collaborations were limited to advanced tertiary care institutions in the past, the increasing availability of institutional resources and support has expanded the range of facilities in which complex procedures are performed to include private institutions.",

The UPS may be integrated into the power for the entire suite, or individual UPS may be placed in line for each central processing unit. The main purpose of the UPS is to prevent the EP system, mapping system, or other critical imaging or monitoring system from going through a hard shutdown and full reboot procedure in case of a transient power outage or surge. Other important electrical components of the laboratory, such as the imaging train, should be connected to emergency backup power so that cases can be completed even if line power is lost. Power lines and data lines should be run separately and isolated from each other in different conduits to prevent EMI from power line wiring induced through data line wiring that could affect optimal performance of the EP equipment. If open cable trays are used above the ceiling, careful consideration should be given to the placement of power lines and other fixtures that can be sources of EMI. Although power lines used on these runs do not necessarily involve enough energy to induce heating, it is still a good rule to follow the specifications of Article 300.20 of the NEC Handbook as a reference.11 Adequate spacing of EP laboratory equipment in the procedural area should be followed.

The ability to support a heavy patient is one of the most important features of the modern EP procedure table, with tables capable of supporting more than 200 kg being commercially available. The length and width of the table are also important considerations. Although standard table lengths are usually sufficient to accommodate most patients, there is growing need for the increased width provided by bariatric surgical tables. Motorized tables with adjustable height and a tilting capacity of up to 20\u00ba have become standard. Tilting into the Trendelenburg position may be helpful in cases of difficult subclavian venous access or internal jugular venous access in ablation and device procedures. Reverse Trendelenburg positioning can be helpful for patients unable to lie flat because of musculoskeletal or respiratory difficulties. Table rotation up to 180\u00ba facilitates patient transport but more importantly provides better access to the table head in cases of emergency. This feature, as well as the ability to tilt sideways, may also be helpful for maximizing surgical exposure in hybrid OR laboratories. Given the need to perform both right- and left-sided procedures, having rails on both sides of the table is particularly useful for mounting equipment and tableside controls. Finally, given the length of some EP procedures, in which patients may lay supine for several hours, a comfortable and supportive EP table pad is important. Foam material is commonly used in EP table pads, but other materials are also available.",

Specific issues related to radiation and limiting exposure are detailed in Section 11. The complexity of procedures performed in the laboratory is the primary determinant of the specific fluoroscopy features needed. Both single- and biplane fluoroscopic systems are suitable for the modern EP laboratory, and the choice of the system is dictated by the specific needs of the laboratory. In basic EP laboratories designed primarily for device implantation, a single-plane system is usually sufficient. Biplane systems are often preferred in more advanced laboratories where ablation is performed, as these biplane systems can be converted to single-plane units for device insertion; however, the advent of 3D mapping technology has diminished operator reliance on biplane fluoroscopy.",

Digital flat panel detectors permit reduction in radiation and provide excellent image quality with a physically smaller and thinner detector. These systems allow greater temporal resolution and contrast ratio with less image distortion and veiling glare and allow the acquisition of high-quality still images. The latter feature is particularly useful for procedures depending on the imaging of vascular structures such as coronary arteries, the coronary sinus, and its branches. Floor- and ceiling-mounted units are available depending on the exact specifications and setup of the laboratory space. Some digital fluoroscopic systems offer advanced imaging capabilities, which may be useful in EP procedures including rotational angiography, rotational CT imaging, and multimodality integration of 3D magnetic resonance and CT images. These features are generally more suited for advanced laboratories performing complex ablation procedures. Three-dimensional reconstructed images from CT, MRI, and rotational fluoroscopy can guide ablation planning, catheter navigation, and catheter ablation.14 The pattern of myocardial scarring defined by delayed enhancement MRI scanning can influence the method of access (endocardial vs. epicardial), catheter type, and type of mapping technology.15 In the setting of atrial fibrillation ablation, a preprocedural 3D image can be helpful in cases of unusual atrial or pulmonary vein anatomy. Creation of a 3D map during the procedure using a mapping system can obviate the need for a preprocedural 3D image.",

Dynamic visualization of intracardiac structures, catheters, and other procedural devices is possible using ICE. The ability to use this modality in real time is an advantage that improves the work flow of the procedure compared with using other pre- or postprocedural augmentative imaging modalities. Using ICE to directly visualize and confirm the proper position of the transseptal needle on the atrial septum can minimize procedural complications, such as cardiac perforation. Pulmonary vein stenosis can be avoided by using ICE to confirm an ostial position of the lasso catheter during pulmonary vein isolation.20 Early detection of complications, such as pericardial effusion or intracardiac thrombus formation, can lead to earlier and more effective interventions.21 Fluoroscopic exposure and its associated risks can be minimized when navigation of catheters and procedural devices are guided by using ICE.22 The success of a procedure can depend on the recognition and successful navigation of challenging anatomy that can be detectable through ICE, such as a prominent Eustachian ridge during atrial flutter ablation, a crista terminalis ectopic tachycardia focus, or a ventricular arrhythmia involving the papillary muscles or aortic cusps.23 Contact of the ablation catheter with tissue can be verified before the delivery of ablative energy, and ablative effects on the tissue can be monitored by assessing morphological changes, including tissue swelling and increased tissue echogenicity.

Remote diagnostics are already a reality because of the growth of several networks that link various laboratories and facilities together. Physicians from a number of institutions can broadcast live and prerecorded procedures and perform real-time consultations with other participating facilities. Remote surgery has been demonstrated using the current generation of remote catheter navigation technologies and has been further bolstered by the addition of newer laboratory integration systems. While the requirements for remote surgery are similar to those of remote diagnostics, there should be much less tolerance for latency and system responsiveness as well as enhanced fail-safe measures and the ability for local override. Significant gaps in state, federal, and international regulations will need to be addressed before telemedicine can reach its full potential in this field.",

The administration of anesthesia varies among case types and among institutions, from anxiolysis or moderate procedural sedation by an Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS)/Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS)-certified nurse under the supervision of the cardiac electrophysiologist51, 52 to monitored anesthesia care or general anesthesia administered by an anesthesiologist or CRNA under the supervision of the anesthesiologist. The health care institution must require those administering or supervising moderate sedation who are not anesthesiologists to meet the requirements of the American Society of Anesthesiologists to obtain privileges.53 Credentialing for this privilege must be periodically renewed. If intravenous procedural sedation will be used, the physician must establish an American Society of Anesthesiologists classification and Mallampati score for the patient before the procedure.36 It is necessary to have these assessments done before the procedure so that, if necessary, alternate plans for sedation may be arranged to optimize patient safety and minimize procedural delays. Medications typically employed include etomidate, propofol, ketamine, fentanyl, midazolam, methohexital, and inhalational agents. Individual states regulate what medications can be administered by nonanesthesiologists. As the provision of sedation is a continuum and the depth of sedation may vary, best practice is that all patients receiving moderate or deep sedation be evaluated by continual observation of qualitative clinical signs, pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure monitoring, heart rate and rhythm, and monitoring for the presence of exhaled carbon dioxide to ensure the adequacy of ventilation unless precluded or invalidated by the nature of the patient, procedure, or equipment.51 Monitoring equipment should be in working order and have appropriate audible alarms. In pediatric cases, factors to be considered for the choice of sedation or general anesthesia include young age, preexisting medical conditions, presence of CHD, airway issues, physician or family choice, and the length and complexity of the procedure. The 2002 NASPE Position Statement on Pediatric Ablation delineated the types of anesthesia (conscious sedation, moderate sedation, and general anesthesia), and these remain applicable.54\n",

Catheters with more electrodes can facilitate rapid recognition of arrhythmia activation patterns and are particularly beneficial at sites such as the coronary sinus. Smaller electrodes and narrower interelectrode spacing detect a more local activation signal and can provide more precise activation mapping, but may be less maneuverable. Activation confined to a small structure or circuit, such as the His bundle or an accessory pathway, however, may be difficult to localize with narrow electrode spacing. The field of signal detection can be increased either by changing to a catheter with wider electrode spacing or by reconfiguring the electrode pairing. With this wider field of view, anatomical localization is decreased. Some diagnostic catheters are designed with electrodes in a specialized spatial configuration, such as circular/ring, basket, or star-shaped catheters. These catheters can enable rapid deciphering of an activation pattern even with a paucity of arrhythmia. The number of catheters and recording sites should be adequate to achieve the desired end points of the procedure, but not so many that vascular damage or obstruction or intracardiac entanglement could occur.",

Noise troubleshooting is a complex issue and involves many variables. It is necessary to be familiar with the basics of signal acquisition provided in Appendix 1 to correct noise issues. An inadequate signal-to-noise ratio will result in physiological signals being obscured by ambient noise with loss of critical information. At the onset of the procedure, steps should be taken to ensure that the signal quality is optimized for successful mapping. This should include the following: (1) choosing the appropriate electrode spacing, (2) setting the high-pass filter high enough to exclude low-frequency artifacts, such as respiratory drift, (3) setting the low-pass filter low enough to exclude high-frequency noise artifacts, (4) turning on the notch filter that excludes the 50\u201360-Hz bandwidth typical of electrical interference, and (5) gaining the signal appropriately to visualize low-amplitude signals of interest while minimizing the magnification of noise artifacts. It should be noted that using the notch filter on bipolar intracardiac signals can introduce ringing to sharp simple signals, making them appear fractionated. This is a particular concern when targeting fractionated potentials in cases of VT and atrial fibrillation. If the laboratory and equipment are properly grounded and the electricity in the laboratory is conditioned, there should be no 50\u201360 Hz noise on the intracardiac signals. Lower gain recording should be employed if the electrogram signals exceed the recording range of the amplifier. Efforts should be made, working with the facility\u2019s biomedical engineering personnel, to achieve the lowest noise signals possible. Steps toward this goal include appropriate equipment grounding and shielding of cables, scheduled maintenance of connecting cables with replacement if contact plugs lose continuity, maintaining the shortest distance traveled by all electrical cables, ensuring that cables are off the floor and removed from potential hazards such as wheeled carts and cleaning solutions, and maintaining separation between high-voltage lines, such as power cables, and low-voltage lines used for transmitting the patient\u2019s electrical signals.",

The guidelines for the implantation of cardiac rhythm devices in young patients and patients with CHD were last updated in 2008.76 Epicardial pacing is used for those in whom transvenous pacing is contraindicated, such as prosthetic tricuspid valves, right-to-left intracardiac shunts, and small patient size, or for those undergoing concomitant heart surgery. The majority of ICDs are implanted via the transvenous route, but this may not be possible in some individuals because of anatomical constraints. Because ICD leads are larger and prone to fibrosis, patient size limitations for transvenous systems are considerable.

Adult patients with CHD incur increased radiation exposure resulting from the electroanatomic complexity of cases and the need for multiple procedures. Strategies for radiation dose reduction as detailed in Section 11 should be aggressively implemented. The most significant complications in small children include pericardial effusion, pneumothorax, atrioventricular block, and death.79, 80 Animal and clinical studies have shown the potential expansion of scar tissue with maturation70 and the risk of late coronary artery injury79 potentially related to ablation location. The risk of atrioventricular block is increased by small patient size and septal pathways, presumably because of the smaller anatomical dimensions of structures. Smaller tip catheters, lowered RF energy, shorter lesion duration, and the use of apnea and pacing techniques may diminish risk.81 Cryoablation is perceived as being safer, but may have a higher recurrence rate compared with RF lesions.82 It is recommended that EP laboratories conducting procedures on pediatric patients have cryoablation capability.",

The highest exposure to patients has been observed with a median skin entrance dose of 7.26 rem (range 0.31-135.7 rem) at the ninth vertebral body. This dose is predicted to be associated with a lifetime excess risk of malignancy to the female breast, active bone marrow, and lung of greater than 700 cases per million undergoing routine catheter ablation. Operator exposure was highest at the left hand, waist, and left maxilla.91 Fluoroscopy equipment should report three parameters: fluoroscopy time; radiation dose (air kerma, in Gy), a measure of deterministic injury potential; and the dose-area product (in cGy\u00b7cm2), a measure of stochastic injury potential. Radiation exposure is a superior metric to fluoroscopy time; reliance on fluoroscopy time is discouraged.

            "text": "The predominant strategy for minimizing radiation exposure to patients is to minimize the radiation dose.86, 92 The most effective approach is to minimize fluoroscopy pedal time. Operators should develop the habit of tapping the fluoroscopy pedal rather than standing on the pedal for a long period of time. If the eyes stray from the fluoroscopy screen, the foot should come off the pedal immediately. Decreasing the fluoroscopy pulse rate will significantly reduce dose at the cost of temporal resolution of the image. Supplementation of fluoroscopic imaging with nonfluoroscopic electroanatomic guidance systems by using stored fluoroscopy loops rather than cine loops and using pulsed fluoroscopy will reduce the total procedural dose. As the X-ray tube gets closer to the patient, X-rays at the skin entry point increase and the risk of deterministic injury also increases; thus, the operator should position the table at a comfortable height with some distance between the tube and the patient. If the image intensifier is not positioned as close to the patient as possible, the image will be magnified but the radiation dose will be much higher. To magnify the image, use the appropriate magnification mode. Both geometric and electronic magnification increases dose to the patient. Doses may be limited effectively by collimation, limiting the field of view with shutters as much as possible. For example, reducing the diameter of the field of view by 29% will reduce the radiation dose by half. Steeply angulated projections should be avoided, and if used, the C-arm should be repositioned somewhat throughout the procedure to avoid delivering radiation to the identical skin entry site. Depending on which procedure is being performed, local shielding of the patient\u2019s thyroid and gonads can be employed.93\n",

Thus, aggressive limitation of fluoroscopy pedal time is desirable, but those efforts may be futile if the dose rate is high because of a high frame rate or employment of an old imaging train. It is now an accepted standard that fluoroscopy dose, not only fluoroscopy time, is entered in the permanent medical record for each fluoroscopic procedure.

Radiation scatter occurs as radiation from the generator tube enters the patient and is partially reflected or refracted by body tissues. Scatter from the patient is the main source of radiation exposure to the patient outside the imaging field and to the operator. The operator and laboratory personnel must be protected from exposure to the scatter radiation with shielding.

Shield extensions above the table rail and a contoured ceiling-mounted shield in contact with the patient\u2019s torso will substantially reduce operator exposure. Since radiation doses decrease with the square of the distance from the source, the operator should perform the procedure as far from the radiation tube as is practical.

This necessitates facial protection, such as surgical mask, eye protection, and/or face shield.

Droplets do not remain infectious over long periods of time and therefore do not require special air handling and ventilation. Airborne infection isolation precautions prevent transmission of infectious agents that remain infectious over long distances when suspended in the air (e.g., rubeola virus [measles], varicella virus [chicken pox], Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and possibly SARS coronavirus). If at all possible, EP procedures should be deferred in these patients unless a negative airflow procedure room is available.
