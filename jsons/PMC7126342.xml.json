            "text": "Acute bronchitis is associated with a generalized pulmonary inflammation infection, usually caused by viruses such as rhinovirus, corona virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, and adenovirus.19, 21\nBordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae are occasional causes of acute bronchitis. B. pertussis should be considered in any adult with a cough illness lasting more than 2 to 3 weeks.19 Acute bronchitis typically begins as an acute viral infection and manifests with cough and occasionally sputum production in the absence of tachycardia, tachypnea, significant fever (> 35\u00b0 C), or an abnormal chest exam. Productive sputum is not predictive of viral, bacterial, or noninfectious causes of cough such as asthma, postnasal discharge, or gastroesophageal reflux disease.38, 39 Causative roles of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae in acute bronchitis have not been demonstrated. Such roles are difficult to establish, because these organisms may colonize the normal respiratory tract.21, 38, 39 Acute bronchitis is a clinical diagnosis, and antimicrobial therapy in the uncomplicated host is not indicated. Bacterial cultures, sputum gram smears, and viral studies on respiratory secretions are not normally helpful and may be misleading.38, 39 A major exception is the adult patient with suspected pertussis in whom documentation of B. pertussis should be attempted. Culture, serology, and more sensitive and specific amplification methods (e.g., polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) are available in reference laboratories. Consensus recommendations for diagnosis of B. pertussis by PCR have been proposed and may become the \u201cgold standard\u201d for diagnosis of pertussis syndrome.12 Presently, however, there is no single, standardized PCR method available. Many laboratories also have the expertise and resources to provide culture and detection of organisms with direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) stains. DFA smears suffer inter-observer variability and lack sensitivity and specificity compared with culture. Calcium-alginate nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates should be submitted in appropriate transport media. The swabs should never be transported dry. The choice of transport medium depends on the time required for delivery of the specimen to the laboratory. Individual laboratories should be contacted for appropriate transport media and instructions. B. pertussis becomes progressively more difficult to culture over the course of the infection. In adults in whom the course may be protracted, supplemental studies may increase the diagnostic yield. If available, the combination of serology and/or PCR in conjunction with culture may be warranted.22, 23\n",

The role of comorbid conditions like underlying heart disease, chronic lung disease, or immunosuppression is important. Viruses, including influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, RSV, rhinovirus, and coronavirus, contribute to AECB.18\nS. pneumoniae and H. influenzae are found in at least half of the patients with AECB, but they may colonize patients with and without AECB. Their isolation rate does not increase during symptomatic episodes. B. pertussis is recognized as a potential contributor to exacerbation. Anaerobes and M. pneumoniae are not commonly found in AECB, while C. pneumoniae is associated with a mild form of disease characterized by cough lasting for weeks. Other bacteria such as beta-hemolytic streptococci, staphylococci, as well as the gram-negative enteric bacilli, rarely contribute to exacerbations and are found in only 10% to 15% of sputum cultures from patients with AECB. Because most of these organisms are commonly present in respiratory secretions in patients with bronchitis, bacterial cultures of sputum are of little value, and the isolation of potential pathogens does not confirm their role in AECB. Smears may delineate the presence of a predominant organism, but microbiological work-up of respiratory secretions rarely contributes to therapeutic decisions. Thus, when required, initial therapy should be directed empirically and should normally cover pneumococci, Haemophilus, and Moraxella. In certain clinical settings (such as the patient with protracted cough lasting more than 3 weeks), B. pertussis should be considered.41 There will be patients who need more microbiologic evaluation than usual, so clinical judgment is needed. Compromised hosts such as patients with multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and patients on long-term corticosteroid therapy are in this category. Recurrent AECB and pneumonia should raise the specter of underlying immunoglobulin deficiency as in acquired hypogammaglobulinemia.",

Extremes of age often have atypical presentations, with the elderly presenting with increased mental confusion.13, 27 The physical examination helps to distinguish noninfectious diseases from infection, for example, CHF, signs of underlying malignancy, signs of thromboembolic phenomena, and hypertension with pulmonary edema; however, physical examination rarely provides insight into specific infective causes. Signs of consolidation on chest exam include dullness to percussion, increased tactile fremitus, increased clarity of whispered or spoken vocal sounds, and bronchial (tubular) breath sounds with a shortened inspiratory phase and a prolonged expiratory phase. Inspiratory crackles are usually heard. The presence of a heart murmur makes infective endocarditis a consideration. Mental status changes should raise immediate concerns about meningitis.

These pathogens include Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), Legionella species, Pneumocystis carinii, some other fungi, and specific respiratory viruses such as influenza. These noncommensal organisms are often considered in certain hosts, and specialized, selective methods are required to identify them. Their isolation in patients with clinical pneumonia often establishes the specific cause of the pneumonia.

Unlike MTB, NTM are ubiquitous in the environment and are not transmitted person-to-person. They may be found in water, dust, soil, and even domesticated pets. With the exception of Mycobacterium kansasii, the clinical significance of NTM in respiratory secretions is problematic, because their presence may represent transient contamination.51 Certain NTM such as those in the Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) are increasing in frequency and involve younger people, many without apparent pre-existing lung disease.37 Women are infected with MAC more often than men and may have an indolent, progressive clinical presentation with cough, usually without weight loss or fever. Nodular, patchy, predominately lower lobe infiltrates that rarely cavitate may progress over months to years. The clinical laboratory will need to identify NTM isolates to species level.

Recently, influenza A infection has been closely linked to an outbreak of severe pneumococcal pneumonia in children.32 Additionally, the Hantavirus causing Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) was first recognized in the United States in New Mexico in 1993. Hantaviruses are zoonotic, infecting wild rodents (e.g., deer mice) and are transmitted to humans through aerosolization of dried excrement. Although the first Hantavirus found in the Four Corners area of the southwest (named Sin Nombre virus) remains the most important, other Hantavirus cases have now been documented throughout the United States.

Susceptibility studies of MTB against the primary antituberculosis agents isoniazid, rifampin, streptomycin, and ethambutol should be performed on all initial isolates and require only an additional five days using newer technology. Radiometric broth techniques for isolation and susceptibility testing and molecular probes for identification of MTB, MAC, and M. kansasii in cultures enable these changes.47 The introduction of high-pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC) methods to identify the mycobacteria by evaluation of the characteristic presence of long-carbon chain fatty acids (mycolic acids or mycolates) in the cell wall has allowed for the rapid and accurate identification of the NTM, as well as the MTB.",

From a clinical perspective, direct fluorescent antibody or EIA methods for detecting the presence of virus directly in cytocentrifuged specimens are most useful. These direct testing methods are particularly useful for viruses like RSV that lose viability when transported. Specimens most likely to yield positive viral results include nasopharyngeal (NP) aspirates, followed by NP swabs, and then throat swabs submitted in appropriate viral transport media.",

The abnormal host requires a different approach and, in general, the more compromised the host, the more aggressive the laboratory evaluation. A renal transplant patient with respiratory symptoms often follows the dictum that \u201ccommon things happen commonly;\u201d however, the clinician needs that extra level of assurance in this case. Some transplant patients may have respiratory illness caused by strongyloidiasis. Cystic fibrosis is another example of the need for a more comprehensive laboratory evaluation. Specialized selective media and additional susceptibility studies may be needed to evaluate isolates associated with exacerbation of symptoms in these patients. The clinical laboratory should be forewarned of any materials coming from invasive diagnostic techniques, so they can prepare and offer useful advice regarding specimens, transport, and follow-up. Microbiological laboratories are often most knowledgeable regarding what type of testing is appropriate. Direct communication with the laboratory is essential to assure the best patient care.",
