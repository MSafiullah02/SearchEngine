Although being identified in the early stages of the epidemic as being close to two other coronaviruses (SARS and MERS) [2], its epidemiological risks in terms of propagation and lethality were not known. Investigations reported by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) demonstrated that a new coronavirus was at the origin of this epidemic [3]. The retrospective analysis of the earlier transmission in Wuhan revealed that human-to-human transmission had occurred since the middle of December, and possibly earlier, through close contacts [4]. After a very rapid dissemination in the Hubei province, the disease has spread to all the other provinces in China. Currently, the epidemic seems to be getting under control thanks to strict control measures [5]. During its early spread in China, the virus also reached several countries in the world, in particular Japan where early measures enabled to control its spread relatively well [6] although restarts are now observed. Subsequently, by the end of February, several important new clusters broke out in South Korea, Iran and Italy. Beginning of March most of Europe was affected, to be followed by the United States. The epidemic is currently affecting the whole world [7].",

The simplest formulation comes from the early work by Kermack and McKendrick in the 1920s [8] and involves three classes: the first one for the people sensitive to the disease who are prone to contracting the disease, a second one for the infectious people who have contracted the disease and can infect susceptible people and a third one for the people outside this cycle because either they became immunised after recovering, or they left the study area, or they have died.",

Three main problems will be met in a modelling perspective of such a situation: (1) What are the relevant variables for a given epidemic? (2) What are the governing equations coupling these variables? (3) What are the parameter values of these equations? Also, in between these questions, two other very practical questions: (4) What observations do we have to build and constrain a model? And, as a corollary, (5) How to reformulate the governing equations based on the available observations? (see Suppl. Mat. 1 for a more detailed contextualisation).",

Their description and pre-processing are given with further details in Suppl. Mat. 3 (Fig. S1).

It is well adapted to the modelling and study of unstable dynamical behaviours: it enables to detect and extract the deterministic component underlying the dynamical behaviour; and, as a consequence, it can be a powerful approach to analyse dynamics which are highly sensitive to the earlier conditions and to detect chaos (see Suppl. Mat. 2). Another interesting aspect of this technique comes from the potential it offers to work even if important variables are missing, which is generally the case in epidemiology. Finally, it has proven to be a powerful tool to detect couplings between observed variables, and even, when all the dynamical variables are observed, to retrieve the original algebraic formulation of the governing equations in a compact and potentially interpretable form [16].",

            "text": "A great number of works have been based on chaos theory to study epidemiological behaviours [17\u201319] but a global modelling approach per se has rarely been applied to biological systems. The first replicable application was in ecology [20]. In epidemiology, it enabled to obtain an interpretable model for the epidemic of Bombay bubonic plague (1896\u20131911) by extracting the couplings between the human epidemic and the epizootics of two species of rats. Although obtained from observational time series without strong a priori model structure, it was found possible in the latter case to give an interpretation to all the model's terms [21]. A model was also obtained for the West Africa epidemic of Ebola Virus Disease (2013\u20132016) coupling the two observed variables made available with a regular sampling: the cumulated numbers of infected cases and deaths [22]. In the present study, this modelling approach is used to model the current COVID-19 epidemic in Asia (China, Japan, South Korea) and Italy and then to produce scenarios for 16 countries (several of these ones included) where the disease was introduced later and spread locally. Two general equation forms are considered in the present study: (1) the multivariate form1based on three observed variables. The aim of this structure is to retrieve the couplings between C1 the number of daily new cases, s1 the number of daily additional severe cases (positive or negative) and D1 the number of daily deaths and (2) the canonical form2based on a single observed variable \u2013 here C\u03a3 the cumulative number of new cases since the beginning of the epidemic \u2013 and its successive derivatives C1 and C2. The aim of this second structure is to analyse and compare the dynamical behaviours. This latter formulation was also applied to the cumulative number of deaths D\u03a3 with its derivatives D1 and D2.",

Three simulations were performed starting from slightly different initial conditions. These trajectories alternatively come closer and move away one to another but do not converge to a single temporal evolution, which illustrates the high sensitivity to the initial conditions. During the identification period (Day of Year (DoY) 20\u221225), the trajectories show a good consistency between the model (grey lines) and the observed data (plain black line). The agreement deteriorates after this period (dashed black line). The data show that the observed number of new cases C1(t) starts to decrease on DoY 37 after a peak of ~5000 cases per day has been reached, whereas the simulations continue rising until reaching a steady regime of much larger magnitude (>7000 cases per day). This discrepancy is explained as a result of the lockdown. Indeed, the lockdowns were set on in China from DoY 23 to 29 (Table 1). Considering the incubation period of 3\u20135 days, the model was thus obtained while the effect of the confinement was still partial, and while the disease was still under progress for contaminated people although contamination had been slowed down. The large oscillations observed in s1(t) (Fig. 1b) are reproduced by the model although they appear slower in the simulations. Finally, although underestimated by the model, the agreement with the data is obviously better for the daily deaths (Fig. 1c). Death is the result of the successive stages of the disease in which duration can highly vary from one patient to another. This generates a delay following the peak of new cases. The number of deaths will thus depend on the number of simultaneous cases s but also on the health system capacity, in particular on the number of ventilators available in a country. Exceeding the capacity can have a direct effect on the dynamical behaviour by generating a plateau rather than a peak for the number of severe cases and smoothing more or less the number of daily deaths depending on the degree of saturation.\n",

Interestingly, small parameter changes of model M2 give rise to a restart after a decreasing period (Fig. S4). This illustrates the possibility to withstand the peaks of the outbreak by controlling the proper parameters. It also reveals the capacity of the approach to obtain governing equations enabling a certain diversity of behaviours. Note that all these models (M1\u2212M5) could be obtained only for periods at the transition between the exponential propagation of the disease and the beginning of the decrease. Yet, while chaotic models can give rise to unpredictable trajectories, they rely on steady dynamics: their governing equations are invariant. Although lockdowns were applied in China during the period ranging from DoY 23\u221229, due to the incubation time the results of these measures started to become effective around 6 February 2020. It is why these chaotic models could be obtained only on a brief time window, revealing the tipping point from uncontrolled (and unbounded) behaviour to a controlled situation, by the early beginning of February (around DoY 37). And it is also why, soon after (around DoY 41), it became possible to obtain a canonical model (general equations form corresponding to Eq. 2) for the set of variables (C\u03a3, C1, C2) converging to fixed points (see model K1 in Suppl. Mat. S5, Fig. S7\u2013S8).",

The behaviour observed in China relies, for more than 83.5%, on the Hubei province whose population size is quite similar to that of Italy. Comparing with the evolution of the epidemic in Italy, this simulation is backing up the fact that the strict control measures applied by the Chinese authorities played an important role in the control of the epidemic. Very strict measures were taken in Hubei (total quarantine of Wuhan and of a part of Hubei province) while the number of daily new cases was around 140 per 10 M population in Hubei. Similar measures were taken in Italy (on 8 March 2020) and more recently in Spain (14 March 2020) but comparatively much later, when the number of cases reached around 3023 per 10 M population in Italy and 2202 in Spain. Details about the types and dates of control measures taken in the countries considered in the study are provided in Table 1. In France, the control measures enforcing confinement of all the French population based on voluntary basis but under government control were taken much later than in China but slightly earlier than in Italy and Spain in terms of number of cases (~1483).",

Considering the ability of the virus to propagate easily and silently in both Asia and Europe, and now everywhere in the world and at all society levels, a tremendous number of people will surely be infected by the SARS-Cov-2 in the weeks and months to come, requiring specific measures to slowdown the propagation of the disease.

To make the comparison between different sizes of population possible, before modelling, the time series were normalised for a population size of 50 million inhabitants. Examples of both the original and model phase portraits are shown in Figure S10 (see also Suppl. Mat. 7). The original and modelled phase portraits of these models are very consistent. These models were obtained at the end of the outbreak for the Chinese provinces and while the epidemic curve had started to decrease in Japan and South Korea; it is why all these models converge to fixed points: their regimes relate to dynamics that are not \u2013 or no longer \u2013 chaotic. These were used to perform scenarios for the outbreaks in progress in Europe, in the United States and even more so.

Despite early control measures taken in Belgium, the spread of the epidemic has significantly overtaken the Italian scenario in terms of cases. This may very likely result from a poor respect of the control measures by part of the population. Finally, the large dispersion of the control measures in the United States mostly reveals the geographic differences in tackling the outbreak with, in particular, late measures in New York where the epidemic started relatively early, and early measures taken in California, where the epidemic began comparatively later. Since, the epidemic is at present still at its beginning, the situation will very likely evolve towards more severe scenarios in the days to come.",

Because the model here obtained at China's scale is mostly based on a contribution at smaller scale (the Hubei, and more especially Wuhan), it was found to be relatively well applicable to Italy (even without population renormalisation, see Fig. 1). The daily deaths toll simulated by the model being even largely exceeded \u2013 and more and more \u2013 by the Italian observations, it shows that this model is characteristic of an even smaller \u2013 intra-province \u2013 scale. Indeed, most of the cases and deaths of the Hubei province actually come from the Wuhan district (on 16 March 2020, 73.7% and 79.7%, respectively [24]). As the epidemic could be circumscribed geographically by stringent \u2013 and generalised \u2013 measures in Wuhan, the model obtained for China finally appears more representative of the extremely smaller urban/suburban scale (~11 million inhabitants), a scale comparable to regions such as Lombardy in Italy (~10 M), or cities such as New York City (~5.80 M) and Los Angeles (~10.M) in the United States. Of course, the model cannot exclusively rely on a geographic scale, but also on the conditions in which it was obtained with early and stringent control. Such a severe scenario did happen at a suburb scale under stringent control. Without such a control, the scenarios can get much worse, even at this scale. Therefore, stringent measures similar to those implemented in China but exclusively focused on specific targets may not prevent the development of Hubei scenario types elsewhere. Without control, several scenarios of this type can happen at intra-province scale.",

What was observed in practice for the 16 countries of this study is a quick evolution of all the European scenarios from relatively light (Heilongjiang to Zhejiang) to moderate (South Korea scenario) and then to relatively severe (Hubei) situations and even much harder (the Italian scenario). We have thus reached a situation in Europe with multiple severe Hubei type scenarios at country scale and potentially much beyond in most of the cases. Since the dynamic observed in China is mainly representative of the suburban scale as explained before, several countries did experience multiple severe Wuhan scenarios inside its borders (such as in Italy, Spain or France).

Three variables are presented: the daily number of confirmed new cases C1 (a), and of additional severe cases variations s1 (b) and the daily deaths D1 (c). Note that a correction factor has been applied to the number C1 of confirmed new cases in Italy to make the comparison with China consistent (see Suppl. Mat. 2). Dashed brown lines correspond to simulations of a possible restart in China.",

For each model, an ensemble of five simulations was run starting from the observational initial conditions (black circle) from 2 April (DoY 93) to 6 April (DoY 97). The population size is taken into account but age, geographical distribution and society organisation are not. Correction factors were applied to each country to account for the inter-countries discrepancies between the cases and the number of deaths (see Suppl. Mat. 2). Four main scenarios have been kept: the Jiangxi (in yellow), the South Korea (in orange), the Hubei (in grey) and the Italian scenarios (in red). The other scenarios were rejected automatically.",
