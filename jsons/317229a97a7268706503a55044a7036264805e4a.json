Underpinning this problem was the underinvestment in microbiological research and testing capacity at the laboratories in Canada. While researchers in Hong Kong were able to correlate clinical and laboratory features of SARS with epidemiological data, the Canadian researchers were not able to do so. The latter were too busy with patient care and did not find time to do the required research. From an operational perspective, the state of emergency (Code Orange) was declared in Canada in March 2003. This threatened the Canadian health care system. Code Orange is part of the Uniform Emergency Codes which has been adopted by the Ontario Hospital Association in 1993. It indicates an external disaster which alerts hospitals to prepare for a rapid influx of patients being brought to hospital by ambulances. The code is intended to be applied to a specific area and to be used for a limited period of time. However, it soon appeared that the Code Orange was not the appropriate response for an infectious disease outbreak such as SARS. The code paralyzed the health care system because there was in fact no extraordinary number of incoming patients, as would be the case during natural disasters. In fact, the challenge in controlling SARS was to significantly restrict access to healthcare facilities. Moreover, Code Orange was not meant for such a broad geographic area and for a sustained period of time. As a consequence, many hospitals unaffected by SARS were forced to reduce their service level significantly. They delayed current procedures and thereby put critical patients at risk. The SARS case illustrates that an organization (the Canadian health care system) might be well-prepared for responding quickly to risks that are induced by the external environment (calculated risks). But the same organization finds it difficult to respond adequately to the indirect and unintended consequences that threatened the system self. Furthermore, procedures and codes (such as Code Orange) may seem reasonable in the eyes of disaster planners.

Network governance refers to interorganizational coordination that differs from market-and hierarchical coordination because they employ a wider set of coordination mechanisms (Grandori, 1999) . Most research focuses on existing networks with stable relationships, while we are interested in instantiating and emerging network relationships and coordination. In the case of emerging networks, social structure is conceived as an outcome and not as a starting point of repeated exchange relationships between participants of the network. For the SARS response network no existing social structure was available. Network structures had to be formed and instantiated in response to the threat of the highly infectious SARS virus. Denning (2006) recently coined the concept of Hastily Formed Network (HFN) which refers to multiple network organizations that are instantiated in response to disasters like earthquakes, terrorist attacks, hurricanes, global infectious diseases. HFN's can be classified according to the kind of events to which they have to respond and for which and organization/country can be prepared. The categorization concerns the relationship between network capabilities and the type of event. Eventually, the type of response gravitates to the availability of information about the event that disrupts our social and economic worlds (Table 11 .2).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 188, "end": 236, "text": "(Van Baalen, Bloemhof-Ruwward, & van Heck, 2005)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 415, "end": 431, "text": "(Grandori, 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 966, "end": 980, "text": "Denning (2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1591, "end": 1600, "text": "(Table 11", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Hastily Formed Networks"}, {"text": "Responding adequately to U-category events implies that a jump (ad hoc stretch) has to be made from an unprepared situation to tightly coordinated action in order to contain the rapid spreading of the SARS virus. Figure 11 .1 shows that, in order to respond adequately, preparedness should be connected to the capability to act. Relying on recent insights of Hagel and Brown (2005) about global process networks we argue that four elements are crucial for understanding SARS as an HFN's: dynamic specialization, connectivity and coordination, leveraged capability building, and network orchestration. In the next section we discuss these network elements, applied to the SARS case. Hagel and Brown (2005) use the concept of dynamic specialization to refer to the commitment to eliminate resources and activities that do no differentiate firms and to concentrate on accelerating growth from capabilities that truly distinguish the firm in the marketplace. In the world of health care systems can mean something different. The SARS case has demonstrated the indisputable role of scientific research and the role of medical labs. The need to specialize in different activities like diagnoses of infections, characterization of micro-organisms, reference services, and support to epidemiological surveillance and epidemic investigation. Acquiring deep knowledge into these different most important knowledge domains requires large investments in basic and fundamental research. However at the beginning of the outbreak of the corona virus there was no knowledge how to identify, diagnose and treat SARS.

The results of this global collaboration of the research labs were quite amazing. SARS was first identified in February 2003. The first scientific papers describing SARS were published already in March 2003 on the New England Journal of Medicine. They came from the research labs in Hong Kong and Canada. The following weeks, papers were published in high-ranked medical and scientific journals with traditionally long lead times like The Lancet, British Medical Journal, Science, New England Journal of Medicine, and JAMA -The Journal of the American Medical Association. In the period March -July 8 256 SARS papers were written by 38 countries (Chiu, Huang, & Ho, 2004) . Interestingly, only 17% of SARS-related papers resulted from international collaboration.

Hardly any modern communication tool was left unused to disseminate up to date information to health care workers, travelers, clinicians, health officials, researchers, etc. The first scientific papers were published online in order to get immediate access to the scientific findings about the corona virus. By setting up the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) in March 2003, the WHO had a potent role as key coordinator and interpreter of epidemiological information. The WHO decided to set up a secure web-site where each research lab could post its findings. Daily teleconferences were organized to discuss the research results and to share information. Because of the firm competition between research labs, the WHO guaranteed that research data would be kept confidential and the labs and re-searchers were not allowed to use someone's finding without prior permission (Abraham, 2004) .

It coordinated specialized knowledge from globally distributed research labs, and it ensured translation of this knowledge into global and local response.
