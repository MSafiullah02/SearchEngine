The entire autopsy area and its contents are designated a biohazard area and posted with appropriate warning signs. The ideal autopsy suite is well ventilated with a negative room pressure airflow exhaust system and contains a separate low-traffic isolation room. Whenever possible, postmortem examinations are carried out during normal working hours by adequate, well-trained staff. It is helpful to have a second autopsy assistant who remains \u201cclean\u201d to record weights, measurements, and other observations, as well as to circulate for any needed supplies. If multiple autopsies are to be performed sequentially, those with the greatest infective risk should be done first, before the staff becomes fatigued. All procedures are carried out in a way that reduces the risk of splashes, spills, droplets, or aerosols. All contaminated equipment, instruments, containers, and so forth should be confined to designated areas (autopsy table, instrument table, dissection area, sink). Paperwork leaving the autopsy suite must not be contaminated, and information from contaminated paperwork can be transferred out of the autopsy suite by photocopy or data-secure photographs.",

The frequency of hand injuries sustained while performing autopsy procedures can be reduced by several simple practices (Box 3-2\n). A pair of scissors can adequately substitute for a scalpel during most autopsy procedures, including evisceration. The use of blunt-tipped, rather than pointed, scissors for almost all autopsy tissue dissection is advisable. When dissecting with a sharp implement in one hand, one should apply countertraction on tissues by using a long-handled tissue forceps held in the opposite hand; do not hold tissues with the fingers of the noncutting hand. For high-risk cases or dissections, steel-link gloves or some other scalpel-resistant material can be used. Plastic or Kevlar cut-resistant gloves provide protection while still allowing relative dexterity, and we encourage their use whenever possible.Box 3-2Rules That Reduce Injury from Scalpels and Other Sharp Autopsy Instruments\nMinimize the use of scalpels for tissue dissection.Never use a scalpel to make blind cuts.Prepare a sufficient number of scalpels before beginning the autopsy to obviate the need for changing scalpel blades during the procedure.Remove blades only with a special safety scalpel blade remover.Allow only a single individual to use a scalpel at any given time, especially in a limited dissection area.Be mindful of where you rest scalpels and other sharp instruments; do not put them haphazardly on the dissection table, but rather place them back in clear sight on an instrument table.Never hand off scalpels directly; place the instrument on a flat surface for transfer.Announce in advance any movements that involve repositioning of a sharp instrument.\n",

A number of systems that use high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtering systems are commercially available. Bone surfaces should be moistened before sawing to cut down the dispersal of bone dust. To limit aerosols, screw cap containers are preferable to snap-top, rubber-stoppered, or cork-stoppered containers. When opening capped containers, cover the opening with a plastic bag to contain aerosols and splashes. Do not overfill a blood specimen vacuum tube by applying pressure through a syringe. When sterilizing tissue before obtaining a culture, be aware that searing tissue with a hot metal instrument can create splatter and a plume of smoke that may contain infectious agents. As an alternative, the organ surface can be sterilized by swabbing centrifugally with an iodine solution.",

Whether the specimen is fresh or fixed, a pan is used for cleanliness during transport of the organ to the photographic stand.

Instruments used for infective cases are immersed in an enzymatic cleaner or detergent, then rinsed and soaked in 2% aqueous glutaraldehyde or 1:10 solution of bleach for at least 10 minutes. Glutaraldehye is advantageous because, unlike bleach, it does not damage aluminum and steel. One should rinse work surfaces with hot water followed by a 1:10 solution of bleach. Several commercial products containing bleach are suitable. Splashing should be avoided.

By law, in many states, all bodies with known infective diseases must be labeled as such for the mortician and others who may come in contact with the remains. Usually this is indicated on the death certificate as well. Absence of this warning, however, should not be taken to mean there is no risk; all bodies should be handled with caution. We find it helpful to inspect bodies in storage on a daily basis to assess whether there has been any undue leakage of fluid into the body bag. Obviously, fluid accumulations should be carefully removed by aspiration or blotting. If necessary, place a warning on the outside of the body bag, alerting others to the possibility of leaking fluids.",

As usual, standard precautions are strictly enforced. Special safety and decontamination procedures are instituted as required. With proper precautions, overhead ultraviolet lights may be used for secondary decontamination.

For protection against diseases transmissible by aerosols, such as tuberculosis, N95 particulate masks (masks able to filter 1-\u00b5m particles in the unloaded state with a filter efficiency of 95%, given flow rates up to 50 L/min) or containment hoods or suits equipped with powered, air-purifying respirators with HEPA filters are used. Collecting body cavity fluids with a ladle or bulb syringe generates less aerosol than a hose aspirator connected to a sink faucet. Placing plastic bags over the head of the decedent during removal of the calvarium with a Stryker saw or saws equipped with HEPA filters within the vacuum system can also reduce the amount of aerosolization. Towfighi and colleagues designed a relatively simple tent-like device for reducing aerosal dispersion during brain removal.24\n",

A small but definite risk of electric shock exists when the detection lead of an ICD is broken or cut, resulting in a discharge of 25 to 40 J. Although shocks of this magnitude are unlikely to cause death, manufacturers recommend that the ICDs be deactivated before manipulation and that high-quality latex surgical gloves be used when handling the devices. Double gloving, with two layers of surgical gloves, provides more protection against shock and is recommended for autopsies with ICDs.34 In many cases, the autopsy prosector is aware of the presence of an ICD after review of the medical history of the deceased. Before the autopsy, cardiology personnel at most medical facilities can be asked to interrogate the device for antemortem information, deactivate it, and provide instructions regarding its proper disposition. At our institution, there is a \u201cdevice nurse\u201d on call for such issues. However, in cases in which history is incomplete or totally lacking, the pathologist encountering an implanted device during autopsy dissection should ascertain whether it is a pacemaker or an ICD before continuing with the autopsy. Biventricular pacemakers are also relatively large, so size alone cannot distinguish an ICD from pacemaker. The outside of the metal case usually has the manufacturer and model information etched into the surface, which can lead to helpful information with a quick Internet search. If an ICD is present, the pathologist should discontinue the postmortem examination until the device is properly deactivated (Box 3-8\n). Because ICDs may explode if incinerated, they should never be discarded without special attention, and the disposition should be guided by either cardiology personnel or the manufacturer.Box 3-8Safety Precautions for Autopsies on Patients with an Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD)\n1.Obtain medical history.2.Use universal precautions (gloves) and other insulating devices.3.Locate and identify all implanted electrical devices; avoid cutting leads.4.If ICD is present, do NOT proceed until deactivated.5.Call cardiology personnel or manufacturer.6.Wait for cardiology personnel to deactivate ICD, or follow manufacturer's instructions for deactivation.7.Request cardiology personnel to obtain electrophysiology information from internal memory of ICD.8.Do NOT discard ICD.9.Do NOT incinerate ICD.10.Ask cardiology personnel or the manufacturer about proper disposition of ICD.\nFrom Prahlow JA, Guileyardo JM, Barnard JJ.

Needle fragments are a potential hazard to pathologists performing autopsies on drug-addicted patients. Embolized needle foreign bodies have been discovered in soft tissues of the neck and even within internal organs.37, 38, 39 In high-risk cases, Hutchins and colleagues40 recommend preautopsy radiographic screening, reduced tissue manipulation during prosection, and delay of autopsy in human immunodeficiency virus\u2013positive cases, in addition to the standard recommendations for protection against injury from sharp instruments.",

Although cyanide may vaporize from other tissues, stomach contents containing ingested cyanide salts present the highest risk, because the gastric acid converts cyanide salts to volatile hydrocyanic gas. Therefore the prosector should open the stomach only in a chemical fume hood or externally vented biologic safety cabinet to reduce the risk of exposure to the toxic gas. Similarly, toxicology laboratory workers handling samples possibly containing cyanide should wear gloves and face and eye protection and manipulate the specimen only in a chemical fume hood.",
