            "text": "Trials to investigate pathogenetic, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of multiple sclerosis (MS) in animal models date back to the first half of the 20th century (Lindsey, 2005) (Fig. 1\n). Before, Louis Pasteur's rabies vaccination (Pasteur and Illo, 1996) gave first hints to the possibility that immunization of humans with xenogenic nervous tissue induces ascending paralysis. Specifically, inoculation of rabies patients with desiccated spinal cord of rabies-infected rabbits caused pareses of limb, neck and facial muscles resulting in gait, swallowing and breathing problems (Baxter, 2007). Conversely, it was shown by Koritschoner and Schweinburg (1925) and Stuart and Krikorian (1928) that injection of human spinal cord or sheep brain into rabbits leads to limb paralysis (clumsy gait and muscle weakness). Rivers et al. (1933) first demonstrated in monkeys immunized with rabbit brain or brain extracts that paralysis was associated with perivascular infiltrates and demyelination in the brain and spinal cord. He called the disease acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, a term that was later changed to experimental allergic or autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Since the frequency and severity of paralyses was correlated to the titer of anti-brain antibodies, researchers in subsequent trials boosted the humoral immune response with Freund's adjuvant (CFA) (Freund and McDermott, 1942), later complemented by pertussis toxin (Munoz et al., 1984). Thereby they could induce oscillatory symptoms and relapsing\u2013remitting courses of the disease accompanied by perivascular leukocyte infiltration in acute lesions and gliosis in chronic lesions both reminiscent of MS pathology (Wolf et al., 1947). Experiments were performed first in guinea pigs (Freund et al., 1947) and monkeys (Kabat et al., 1947, Morgan, 1947, Wolf et al., 1947) and later in various other species including mice (Olitzky and Yager, 1949) and rats (Lipton and Freund, 1952) enabling more extensive immunogenetic, histopathological and therapeutic studies. It turned out that the histopathology and the clinical course of the disease varied significantly reflecting in part the heterogeneity of its human counterpart dependent on the genetic background of the animals, the source of the antigenic material and the mode of application of the antigen (Hartung et al., 2005, Olsson et al., 2000, Wekerle et al., 1994).",

            "text": "to small encephalitogenic peptides (Eylar et al., 1970, Lennon et al., 1970) such as MBP1\u201337, MBP1\u201311, MBP1\u20139, MBP83\u201399, MOG55\u201375 and PLP139\u2013151, more reproducible EAE models became available that mirror different features of MS (Wekerle et al., 1994). More recently a variety of additional antigens have been supposed to be involved in autoimmune reaction in MS and EAE (Table 1\n). Some of them are myelin constituents such as neurofascin NF 155 (Mathey et al., 2007), others are expressed on myelin and axons such as contactin-2/transient axonal glycoprotein-1 (TAG-1) (Derfuss et al., 2009) and some are entirely non-myelin antigens such as the neuronal membrane protein neurofascin NF 186 (Mathey et al., 2007), the neuronal cytoskeletal protein neurofilament-M (Krishnamoorthy et al., 2009) and the astrocyte-typical Ca2+-binding protein S100\u03b2 (Kojima et al., 1997). The neurofascins NF 155 and NF 186 and the adhesion molecule contactin-2/TAG-1have been identified as putative MS auto-antigens by a proteomics-based screening approach of MS sera and were subsequently shown to promote the autoimmune pathogenesis of EAE in rat models (Derfuss et al., 2009, Derfuss et al., 2010, Mathey et al., 2007). Antibodies to neurofascins, in particular to NF 186, caused axonal injury without enhancing inflammation and demyelination in MOG\u2013EAE (Mathey et al., 2007). In contrast to MOG\u2013EAE, contactin-2/TAG-1-specific T cells induced inflammatory lesions preferentially in the cerebral cortex and the spinal cord white and gray matter (Derfuss et al., 2009). However, while these cells were unable to cause demyelination by themselves they opened the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) thereby allowing access of anti-MOG antibodies to the central nervous system (CNS) where they could trigger demyelination. The EAE variants induced by axonal antigens may reflect special features of MS subtypes, e.g. those characterized by cortical lesions or by histological patterns II and IV according to the classification of Lucchinetti et al. (2000). The schematic drawing in Fig. 2\nindicates the molecular localisation of currently known putative auto-antigens in EAE. Proteins, glycoproteins and lipoproteins possessing encephalitogenic epitopes may be exposed to the outer surface of ODCs (1) or myelin (2) or they may reside in the compact myelin zone (3), at the myelin\u2013axon interface (4) or the node of Ranvier (5). As to the last localisation the three adhesion molecules NF 155 and NF 186 contactin-2/TAG-1 are differentially expressed. Whereas NF 155 is localised at the paranodal myelin loop and interact with contactin-1/F3 and the contactin-associated protein 2 (caspr 2) on the axoplasm in a ternary complex (Charles et al., 2002), NF 186 is exposed in the non-myelinated part of the node of Ranvier and interacts with the neuron-glia-related cell adhesion molecule (NrCAM) and voltage-gated Na+ channels (Hedstrom et al., 2007). Contactin-2/TAG-1 is also expressed juxtaparanodal by both the myelin and axonal membrane forming dimers or molecular zippers (M\u00f6rtl et al., 2007, Shimoda and Watanabe, 2009). Whether lipids, glycolipids and phospholipids play also a role as auto-antigens in EAE and MS is not clear, although several evidences from experimental and clinical studies support such a role (Podbielska and Hogan, 2009). Candiate myelin lipid auto-antigens in MS and/or EAE are shown in Table 1. In a lipid microarray study of Kanter et al. (2006) co-immunization with sulfatides and co-application of sulfatide-specific antibodies worsened the clinical course of PLP139\u2013151\u2013EAE in SJL/J mice, and Quintana et al. (2008b) found auto-antibodies to lipids such as oxidized cholesterol derivatives in the serum of MS patients with the immunopathologic pattern II according to Lucchinetti et al. (2000). However, the oxidized cholesterol derivatives did not affect the specific humoral and T cell response in MOG55\u201375\u2013EAE.",

            "text": "Several studies have shown that actively induced EAE models can reproduce the typical temporal maturation of MS lesions from inflammation with or without deposition of immunoglobulin through demyelination and axonal damage to gliosis and partial remyelination. However, special phenotypes of MS pathology such as primary neuronal degeneration, shift of CD4+ T helper cells to CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and lesions in cortical areas are rarely reproduced by actively induced EAE models (Aktas et al., 2007, Gold et al., 2006, Herrero-Herranz et al., 2008, Linker et al., 2005, Pomeroy et al., 2005). Hitherto it is not clear to which extent cortical lesions account for the brain atrophy in MS. Merkler et al. (2006) could induce focal demyelinating lesions in the cortex of MOG\u2013EAE rats by stereotactical injection of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3). Corresponding to findings in MS the focal cortical lesions were rapidly remyelinated. Accordingly, in marmoset MOG\u2013EAE focal cortical lesions were not the major cause of diffuse cortical atrophy (Pomeroy et al., 2008). The potential pathomechanisms of CNS atrophy in MS are complex and may include several mechanisms of neuronal damage such as anterograde Wallerian degeneration, neuronal dying-back and neuronal soma and dendritic shrinkage (Dziedzic et al., 2010, Siffrin et al., 2010). Currently, disclosure of the exact mechanisms of axon damage is a major challenge of MS research, since it appears to be the main cause of clinical disability and may be the result of immune and/or non-immune attacks on neurons rather than a consequence of immune-mediated demyelination (Siffrin et al., 2010).",

A Chlamydia pneumonia-specific peptide sharing an immunodominant epitope with MBP-induced severe clinical and histological EAE (Lenz et al., 2001), whereas intestinal parasites conveyed resistance to EAE in EAE-susceptible Lewis rats (Zorzella et al., 2007). Also, human herpes virus type 6, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, measles virus and retroviruses have been implicated in the aetiopathogenesis of MS, but currently available experimental and clinical data are not convincing enough to justify anti-viral or antibiotic therapy in MS. However, experimental demyelinating diseases induced by Theiler's virus (Theiler, 1934, Ure and Rodriguez, 2005), coronavirus (Lavi, 2005) or canine distemper virus (Seehusen and Baumg\u00e4rtner, 2010) are suitable models for the investigation of some aspects of MS pathology.",

For example, even aggressive immunosuppression is not sufficient to treat progressive MS. Therefore, additional experimental models are needed, especially for the study of non-immune-mediated demyelination and axonal loss via ODC degeneration. For this purpose a toxic model of demyelination has been developed that is based on the selective toxicity for ODCs of the copper chelator biscyclohexanone oxaldihydrazone (cuprizone) (Blakemore, 1972, Carlton, 1966). If young mice are fed with cuprizone, focal demyelination occurs predominantly in the cerebellar cortex and peduncle. After withdrawal of the toxin spontaneous remyelination can be seen predominantly in the rostral regions (Skripuletz et al., 2010, Torkildsen et al., 2008). Thereby the cuprizone-model correlates well with histopathological features of MS, especially in the subtype or variant classified as histological pattern III according to Lucchinetti et al. (2000), which renders it a useful tool for MS research (Einstein et al., 2009, Kipp et al., 2009). Paradoxically, according to a recent report of Herder et al. (2009) cuprizone ameliorates Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis suggesting that it might have immunomodulatory and/or anti-viral properties in addition to its toxic effects.",

            "text": "Currently, the most common mode of EAE induction is based on the injection of an encephalitogenic peptide, mostly MOG35\u201355 or PLP139\u2013151, which is emulsified in CFA containing mineral oil and Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37RA, followed by intraperitoneal injections of pertussis toxin (Fig. 3\n). The resulting phenotype depends mainly on the antigen source and the genetic background of the animal species and strains used. For example, PLP139\u2013151 induces a relapsing\u2013remitting EAE in SJL mice, whereas MOG35\u201355 triggers chronic-progressive EAE in C57BL mice that are the most favored mice for transgenic experiments (Gold et al., 2006). Crossing of C57BL mice, which over-express MOG-TCR and MOG-specific B cells, resulted in a severe form of EAE that closely replicated Devic's variant of MS with inflammatory lesions of optic nerves and spinal cord (Bettelli et al., 2006). MOG-TCR transgenic mice backcrossed to SJL/J background develop a relapsing\u2013remitting form of EAE with episodes altering between optic nerve, cerebellum and spinal cord. Evolution of this model depends on an intact B cell compartment. Apparently, MOG-TCR transgenic T cells expand endogenous auto-reactive B cells that manufacture pathogenic demyelinating auto-antibodies to a conformational epitope on native MOG protein whilst not recognizing the T cell target MOG peptide (P\u00f6llinger et al., 2009). The authors claim to have generated the first spontaneous animal model for relapsing\u2013remitting MS. Current types of AT-EAE include those induced by Th17 cells suggesting that these newly detected effector cells may in part be responsible for the pathological heterogeneity of MS lesions (Afzali et al., 2007, Gold and L\u00fchder, 2008, Hofstetter et al., 2007, Hofstetter et al., 2009, J\u00e4ger et al., 2009, Korn et al., 2007, Quintana et al., 2008a, Reboldi et al., 2009). All EAE models are directly accessible to investigation of the immune and nervous system (Fig. 3), which interact during the pathogenesis of the disease and which are both targeted by established and experimental therapies.",

            "text": "Since MS appears to be a polygenetically determined disease, efforts have been undertaken by linkage and association studies to define chromosomal regions, quantitative trait loci (QTL), that control the susceptibility to the disease and to compare these QTL with the susceptibility loci in the animal model EAE (Serrano-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2004). The high frequency of intergenomic EAE/MS consensus genes supports the value of EAE for studying of MS features. Backcross (offspring-parent mating) and intercross (sibling mating) experiments with EAE susceptible and resistant animal strains of mice, rats, guinea pigs and hamsters revealed mainly MHC-linked QTL (Encinas et al., 1996, Olsson et al., 2000). Combined-cross analysis could enhance the detection of QTL with moderate effects in rats (Jagodic and Olsson, 2006). Genotyping of 150 microsatellite markers in F2 intercross populations of EAE-susceptible SJL/L mice and EAE-resistant C57BL/10.S mice identified QTL linked to increased latency of cortical motor evoked potentials in non-immunized animals, which correlated with earlier onset of the disease (Maz\u00f3n Pel\u00e1ez et al., 2005). This finding points to a role of myelin composition and synaptic transmission in susceptibility to EAE and provides a chance to detect individuals with high risk for autoimmune demyelination by QTL analysis before the disease is manifested. In MS, some immune response-related genes have been identified by genome-wide association studies using single nucleotide polymorphism analysis with microarray technique as being heritable risk factors of the disease, although their individual contribution is clearly modest with odds ratios for most not exceeding 1.2 (IMSGC, 2007). These genes include the interleukin (IL)-2\u03b1 and IL-7\u03b1 receptor genes on chromosomes 10 and 5, respectively, and some human leukocyte antigens (HLA) belonging to MHC class II molecules on chromosome 6 (Table 2\n) (Gregory et al., 2007, Hafler et al., 2007). More recently, the genes encoding the following proteins have been confirmed as novel MS risk genes (explanation of abbreviations in Table 2) (Aulchenko et al., 2008, Dabbeekeh et al., 2007, De Jager et al., 2009a, De Jager et al., 2009b, Hafler et al., 2009, Hoppenbrouwers et al., 2008, Hoppenbrouwers et al., 2009, Hafler et al., 2007, Johnson et al., 2010, Mero et al., 2010, Rubio et al., 2008, Sarrias et al., 2007):-EV15, CD58, KIF1B, RGS1 and RPL5 (on chromosome 1),-IL-12A (on chromosome 3),-PTGER4 (on chromosome 5),-OLIG3-TNFAIP3 (on chromosome 6),-CD6 (on chromosome 11),-TNFRSF1A (on chromosome 12),-IRF8 and CLEC16A (on chromosome 16),-CD226 (on chromosome 18), and-TYK2 (on chromosome 19).\n",

In contrast, genes related to antigen processing can also slow down disease progression as reflected by a milder course of the disease in MOG35\u201355\u2013EAE of congenic NOR/LtJ mice compared to the wild-type NOD mice (Mayo and Quinn, 2007). Similarly, congenic mapping of the rat genome confirmed that a chromosomal region homologous to a human MS susceptibility region confers protection against MOG\u2013EAE (Jagodic et al., 2001). Also, transgenic MOG35\u201355\u2013EAE mice over-expressing the TCR for MOG35\u201355 showed protective rather than pathogenic effects (Mendel et al., 2004). In contrast, transgenic mice over-expressing MBP-specific TCR developed high frequency spontaneous EAE (Goverman et al., 1993, Lafaille et al., 1994). The relevance of these findings for the human disease remains to be elucidated. Research in EAE also yielded hints for the existence of chromosomal loci that control disease susceptibility in dependence of age and season pointing to a role of chronobiology in autoimmunity (Teuscher et al., 2006). Moreover, EAE susceptibility can vary even between different colonies of the same animal strain as demonstrated for Lewis rats purchased from different animal facilities (Gould et al., 1994). Since the genetic background of these animals is almost identical, other mechanisms, preferentially those involving gene regulating, may be responsible for differences in disease susceptibility and progression. Transcriptome and proteome analyses are powerful new tools for the elucidation of those mechanisms (Elkabes and Li, 2007, Fernald et al., 2005, Goertsches and Zettl, 2007, Ibrahim et al., 2001, Ibrahim and Gold, 2005).",

The hereby included hypothesis-neutral gene expression studies are mainly performed with microarray technique (RNA profiling) and applied in MS patients to peripheral blood mononuclear cells or brain tissue and in EAE animals to lymphatic and nervous tissue (Goertsches and Zettl, 2007, Tajouri et al., 2007). They deliver an increasing wealth of data, which implies a great challenge for bioinformatic analysis that may include pathway analyses using background information from the Gene Ontology project and other data bases as well as data mining approaches. Results of gene expression studies are generally hampered by methodical problems such as the heterogeneity of the material from different individuals and the difficulties in defining a reasonable threshold for differentially expressed genes. Nevertheless, meaningful data have already been obtained from expression studies in EAE that point to new EAE-QTL and susceptibility genes, dissect new pathogenic and protective pathways and identify new therapeutic targets (Comabella and Martin, 2007, Jelinsky et al., 2005, Matejuk et al., 2003, Maz\u00f3n Pel\u00e1ez et al., 2005, Mix et al., 2002, Mix et al., 2006, Paintlia et al., 2004). As an example, the comparison of the EAE-resistant strain C57BL/10.S with the EAE-susceptible strain C57BL/6 in the MOG35\u201355\u2013EAE model strongly supported EAE-resistance to be an active process revealing new target genes for therapeutic intervention (Mix et al., 2004).

(2005) derived from the MOG35\u201355\u2013EAE model led to new conclusions such as(i)early non-specific BBB impairment (mainly neutrophil-related) secondary to immunization with CFA,(ii)transition from innate to adaptive immune responses before onset of EAE,(iii)identification of at least 3 discrete EAE phases (early EAE, peak EAE and early recovery) with characteristic gene expression patterns, and(iv)early neuronal damage.\n",

RNA profiling has also enabled researchers to identify genes which support maintenance of the hematopoietic stem cell niche synapse as a source for therapeutic mesenchymal stem cells that can ameliorate EAE (Pedemonte et al., 2007).

The same is true for the proteome approach (reviewed in Elkabes and Li, 2007, Linker et al., 2009a). In EAE, it has served to generate differential protein expression profiles (Duzhak et al., 2003, Liu et al., 2007), to monitor the diversity of autoantibody responses (Robinson et al., 2003) and to validate new therapeutic targets derived from laser-capture micro-dissections of MS lesions (Han et al., 2008).

            "text": "EAE models have considerably contributed to our understanding of immune regulatory processes in the pathogenesis of MS (Gold et al., 2006, Wekerle et al., 1994). While traditionally regulatory (suppressive) activity in autoimmune processes was primarily attributed to CD8+ T cells (Zozulya and Wiendl, 2008), more recently CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Yi et al., 2006) have attracted interest in this respect (Ephrem et al., 2008, Paintlia et al., 2008, Tischner et al., 2006). They seem to be important as antagonists of CD4+ Th17 cells (Afzali et al., 2007, Littman and Rudensky, 2010, Quintana et al., 2008a) that are supposed to be effector cells in EAE (Hofstetter et al., 2007, Huppert et al., 2010, Liu et al., 2010, Steinman, 2007) and MS (Gold and L\u00fchder, 2008). However, the pathogenic role of Th17 cells and of IL-17 in EAE is controversial. According to findings of Haak et al. (2009) in transgenic mice the in vivo function of IL-17 in the CNS may be redundant and the members of the IL-17 family IL-17A and IL-17F may contribute only marginally to the autoimmune pathogenesis of MOG35\u201355\u2013EAE. On the other hand, Huppert et al. (2010) found that IL-17A promotes breakdown of the BBB, a crucial step in the development of EAE. Moreover, findings of Nowak et al. (2009) point to a pro-inflammatory role of the Th17-derived IL-9 in MOG35\u201355\u2013EAE. Th17 cells are driven by IL-21 (Korn et al., 2007) and IL-23 (Langrish et al., 2005, McKenzie et al., 2006) and suppressed by IL-27 (Fitzgerald et al., 2007, Wang et al., 2008). Recently, the IL-7-IL-7R pathway has been implicated in the survival and expansion of effector/memory Th17 cells. Blockade of IL-7R rendered differentiated Th17 cells susceptible to apoptosis which led to attenuation of MOG\u2013EAE (Liu et al., 2010). Corresponding IL-17+ CD8+ Tc cells show impaired cytotoxicity and IFN-\u03b3 production, but may through their excessive IL-17 production contribute to inflammatory processes in EAE and MS (Huber et al., 2009). Recently, Sobottka et al. (2009) could demonstrate in brain slices of transgenic mice that myelin-directed CD8+ Tc cells cause extensive damage not only of the myelin sheath, but also of the axons. Consequently, these cells may contribute to axonal loss in EAE and probably also in MS with the immunopathologic pattern I according to Lucchinetti et al. (2000).",

Anti-myelin antibodies are supposed to be major components of the histopathologic MS pattern II according to Lucchinetti et al. (2000). A special role as targets for antibodies in distinct types of EAE and MS is ascribed to the myelin molecules MOG (Haase et al., 2001) and the axonal molecule neurofascin (Hohlfeld et al., 2008).",

Identification of reliable surrogate markers for diagnostic and prognostic purposes (responder detection for specific therapies, disease follow-up) will be a prominent task of the future. However, a consistent limitation for the translation of experimental results into the clinic is the different situation in EAE and MS concerning the timeline of detection of clinical signs and of therapeutic interventions (Fig. 5\n). Whereas in EAE pathological processes can be observed from the beginning and treatment approaches can be started at the early pre-clinical phase, in MS diagnostic measures will commonly not be initiated before first clinical signs are present and the intensity of treatment increases usually until late progression of the disease.",

Surprisingly, it turned out that copolymer 1 suppressed rather than induced EAE, most probably via stimulation of Th2/Th3-mediated anti-MBP immune response (Aharoni et al., 1997, Aharoni et al., 2008). Recent studies utilising sophisticated immunologic techniques point to a more complex mechanism of action of glatiramer acetate, including modification and killing of APCs, generation of regulatory T cells and turning the polyclonal CD8+ T cell response into an oligoclonal one (Racke et al., 2010).",

In IFN-\u03b2 treated EAE, interruption of therapy caused disease exacerbation (van der Meide et al., 1998). In an attempt to explore the influence of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy on the local immune response in the CNS, J\u00f8rgensen et al.

            "text": "In other therapeutic trials, two treatments have been combined in order to achieve synergistic effects and/or to reduce adverse side-effects of single agents. For example, combined application of MP and erythropoietin protected neurons and axons of retinal ganglion cells and optic nerve of rats with MOG-induced EAE from morphological and functional impairment, whereas monotherapy caused only isolated neuronal or axonal protection without clinical benefit (Diem et al., 2005). In a MBP-induced active rat EAE model, the anti-inflammatory, anti-demyelinating and neuroprotective effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitory statins could be improved by combination with the selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor rolipram (Paintlia et al., 2008, Paintlia et al., 2009) or the protein kinase A activating substance 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-\u03b2-d-ribofuranoside (Paintlia et al., 2006), even when the statin was applied in suboptimal doses. For rolipram alone, beneficial effects in the animal model could previously not be reproduced in the human system (Zhu et al., 2001). In actively induced chronic murine EAE a synergistic therapeutic effect of IFN-\u03b2 and the immunomodulatory drug laquinimod was observed (Runstr\u00f6m et al., 2006). In a patient study, the IFN-\u03b2-mediated up-regulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was enhanced by additive administration of the non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor pentoxiphylline (Weber et al., 1998). Pentoxiphylline also reduced side-effects of IFN-\u03b2 therapy such as myalgia, fever and injection site reactions (Rieckmann et al., 1996). IVIg decreased T cell apoptosis and liver damage, but increased ODC apoptosis in high-dose MBP-treated rats with AT-EAE induced by MBP-specific T cells (Weishaupt et al., 2002). But there are also perilous combination effects, which cannot always be foreseen and thereby prevented in the animal model as illustrated by the hazardous combination of IFN-\u03b2 with natalizumab (Hartung et al., 2009, Kleinschmidt-DeMasters and Tyler, 2005, Langer-Gould et al., 2005, St\u00fcve and Bennett, 2007) or statin (Birnbaum et al., 2008).",

            "text": "On the other hand, there are several examples of compounds which were quite effective in curtailing disease activity in the animal model but turned out to lack therapeutic utility or proved to generate inacceptable adverse effect in MS patients. These inconsistencies prompted Sriram and Steiner (2005) to consider EAE a \u201cmisleading model of MS\u201d. Examples for therapy failures in MS are given in Table 3\n. Reasons for the discrepant result obtained in the animal and human systems could be manifold. Their nature may be genetic (species differences, peculiarities of inbred animal strains), pathogenetic (individual variability between MS patients) or kinetic (different ontogeny and biorhythms, temporal differences of immune reactivity and response to therapy). Additionally, in MS the BBB may be insufficiently disrupted as compared to EAE thereby preventing therapeutic molecules to reach their target within the CNS. This seems to be relevant especially when targeting cytokines in MS. For example, the mAb to IL-12 p40 ustekinumab failed to improve relapsing\u2013remitting MS despite promising results in rodent and marmoset EAE (Segal et al., 2008; reviewed in Steinman, 2010). Other promising therapeutic principles revealed already in the animal model limited benefit or adverse effects precluding their use as MS therapeutics. Examples are:(i)the neuroprotective polypeptide hormone ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), which elicited an acute-phase response in rat liver (Dittrich et al., 1994),(ii)the anti-adhesion molecule mAb anti-CD54, which revealed no MRI effect in AT-EAE (Morrissey et al., 1996),(iii)the Na+-channel blocker phenytoin, which potentially protects demyelinated axons, but resulted in exacerbation of MOG\u2013EAE after withdrawal (Black et al., 2007),(iv)the phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor rolipram, while very effective in suppressing EAE, failed to suppress inflammatory activity as gleaned through magnetic resonance imaging in a pilot trial in patients with relapsing\u2013remitting MS (Bielekova et al., 2009),(v)the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A prevented BBB disruption and suppressed the development of EAE, but was classified as unacceptable for treatment of MS based on risk/benefit consideration due to low efficacy and frequent adverse reactions (Goodin et al., 2002, Kappos et al., 1988, Kieseier and Hartung, 2003, McCombe et al., 1999, Paul and Bolton, 1995).\n",

The most promising experimental therapies rely on gene transfer, stem cell transplantation, oral administration of small molecular weight disease-modifying drugs and intravenous or subcutaneous application of mAb targeting cells or molecules crucial in the pathogenesis of the disease (Aktas et al., 2010, Bielekova and Becker, 2010, Butti et al., 2008, Einstein et al., 2009, Hauser et al., 2008, Hawker et al., 2009, Hemmer and Hartung, 2007, Kieseier and Wiendl, 2007, Pluchino and Martino, 2008, Wynn et al., 2010). Table 6\nprovides a survey of experimental therapeutic approaches that are currently being investigated, some of which being already approved for phase I-III clinical trials. Table 6 also includes proposed mechanisms of action of the new therapies. Putative targets of established and experimental MS therapies with and without prior testing in EAE are indicated in Fig. 4. Other experimental approaches for MS are based on vaccination, e.g. with pathogenic T cells, TCRs, dendritic cells pulsed with antigen, DNA vaccine encoding MBP, axonal growth inhibitors associated with myelin or pro-inflammatory cytokines. These approaches are extensively reviewed elsewhere (Correale et al., 2008). Recently, a new therapeutic target for a more selective treatment of EAE and MS compared to available therapies has been proposed, i.e. the IL-7-IL-7R pathway that affects pathogenic Th17 cells, but spares regulatory T cells and unrelated immune cells (Liu et al., 2010).",

So far experimental trials have involved transplantation of neural stem cells, ODC precursor cells, Schwann cells and olfactory ensheathing cells and application of growth factors such as platelet derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor (Franklin and Ffrench-Constant, 2008). However, these trials are hampered by the fact that the demyelinating lesions are regularly wide-spread and dispersed within the CNS and that they, additionally, lack stimulating factors of ODC precursor cell recruitment and differentiation, or even contain inhibitory factors of remyelination like the neurite outgrowth inhibitor-A (Nogo-A) and its receptor component leucin-rich repeat and Ig domain containing-1 (Lingo-1) (Pernet et al., 2008). Therefore, current efforts to enhance remyelination in EAE and MS rely mainly on established therapies with remyelinating potency such as IVIg, especially polyclonal IgM (Bieber et al., 2000, Trebst and Stangel, 2006, Wright et al., 2009), glatiramer acetate (Aharoni et al., 2008, Arnon and Aharoni, 2009, Racke et al., 2010) and fingolimod (Miron et al., 2008, Miron et al., 2010) or on the application of antagonists of the remyelination inhibitors Nogo-A and Lingo-1 (Bourquin et al., 2008, Mi et al., 2007, Mi et al., 2009, Rudick et al., 2008, Yang et al., 2010).",
