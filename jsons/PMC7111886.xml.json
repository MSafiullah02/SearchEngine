Suspected cases were managed in negative pressure isolation units, and the institute implemented designated Ebola protocols and circuits for patients, medical personnel, healthcare materials, biologic samples and medical waste. In the institute, healthcare workers (HCWs), including but not limited to physicians, nurses and nurses' aides, receive yearly training on standard precautions, while during 2014, they were invited to participate in training on five specific Ebola-related topics, namely, correct use (donning and doffing) of personal protective equipment, protective measures, circuits for suspected Ebola cases, management of biological risk and case management.

This is, to a certain degree, a reflection of reality but is probably an overrepresentation of the actual risk as we also found that respondents reporting high perceived risks were more likely to be less informed about what Ebola is (P = 0.019) and about what treatment and prevention options are available (P = 0.033). A similar study conducted in Spain in 2016 reported that 48% of the nurses surveyed considered they would stand a very high risk of biological accidents if they were to care for suspected cases of Ebola infection.8 However, their study did not quantify risk perception on a continuous scale, but rather as very low through very high, and therefore, a direct comparison with our results cannot be performed.

The study performed by Olowookere et al. revealed radio (37.2%) and the internet (28.4%) as frequent sources of information on Ebola for HCWs in Nigeria,10 similar to the data seen in our study, where 33.1% of respondents cited the internet and 30.6% cited mass media as sources of information. This relatively low use of mass media in HCWs for information purposes (lower than the rate of 53.1% use of television and 45.5% use of internet for retrieving information on Ebola by the general population in Germany7) is probably due to the fact that most of our HCWs (81.5%) had already received pertinent information at the time of our survey from their employer, the Matei Bal\u0219 Institute. An encouraging finding was that those who had received various trainings on Ebola disease in the institute during the 2014 outbreak were 1.2\u20131.3 times more likely to correctly identify transmission routes 2 years later during our survey in 2016. Another important aspect is that respondents who did not correctly identify Ebola or its transmission routes in our survey self-reported 1.8 times more frequently that they felt the need for more information on prevention methods, suggesting that when there is a gap in knowledge, this is self-acknowledged and can thus be remedied promptly.",

However, our study does provide robust data in terms of Ebola preparedness and risk perception, and the fact that it has been applied after the end of the outbreak offers the unique advantage of providing reliable data, outside of the window of maximum emotional involvement. Therefore, the information can better be generalised and can also serve as a baseline evaluation for further panel surveys to assess the impact of interventions and trainings to be deployed in Romania in the following years.",
