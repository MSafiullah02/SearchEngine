Most patients who present with basal cell carcinoma pathology usually have a longstanding condition and are asymptomatic, or only mildly symptomatic, from their NMSC. In view of the real threat from the coronavirus, particularly in elderly patients and/or with comorbidities, including life-threatening conditions, their treatment with radiation should be deferred for at least 3\u20134 months, pending further review of the situation.\u2022Individual treatment centres should follow the recently published \u2018COVID-19 rapid guideline: delivery of radiotherapy\u2019 [1] and adapt their strategy based upon staffing, capacity and structure.\u2022COVID-19 priority levels in radiotherapy (1\u20135) [2].\u2022Departments should consider how they will deliver radiotherapy to NMSC patients who are COVID-19 positive or suspected on clinical grounds.\u2022Proposed changes to current treatment pathways should be discussed within skin or head and neck local or specialist multidisciplinary teams and any unforeseen consequences of COVID-19 effectively communicated with colleagues and patients.\u2022The Royal College of Radiologists' clinical oncology online forum and other professional forums should be used to seek advice from colleagues.\u2022All changes in standard management should be clearly recorded in the patient record and discussed with the patient/family/carers.\n",

These patients are generally elderly and should avoid hospitals wherever possible.\u2022Special consideration needs to be given to immunocompromised patients, including post-transplant, in whom the risk of contracting the virus and developing COVID-19 is substantial. The benefit of postoperative radiotherapy should be carefully weighed against the risk of exposure to the virus and deferred radiotherapy or close clinical monitoring should be considered, particularly in closely excised lesions.\u2022Omitting adjuvant radiotherapy should be considered where the benefit is likely to be limited and may be outweighed by the risks, e.g. patients with closely excised cSCC <1 mm or with minor risk factors who would normally have been considered at lower/intermediate risk of recurrence (priority 5).\u2022Patients with closely excised cSCCs at high risk of recurrence could have a clinical review by the referring surgeon/dermatologist in 3\u20134 months regarding the possibility of further surgery or adjuvant radiotherapy.\u2022Hypofractionated radiotherapy regimens should be considered to reduce the number of patient visits to hospital. This will reduce the risk of exposure to the virus for both patient and staff and reduces the overall burden to radiotherapy departments, e.g. 32.5 Gy in four fractions instead of 35 Gy in five fractions, 40 Gy in eight fractions instead of 45 Gy in 10 fractions, 50 Gy in 15 fractions instead of 55 Gy in 20 fractions.\n",

Single fraction or shorter fractionated schedules, depending on the clinical scenario, should be considered.\u2022Metastatic spinal cord compression is priority 2 (\u2018urgent palliative radiotherapy in patients with malignant spinal cord compression who have useful salvageable neurological function\u2019).\u2022The risk benefit of palliative immunotherapy or chemotherapy in patients with metastatic or recurrent NMSC should be carefully considered and discussed with patients on an individual basis. In some patients it would be reasonable to wait for a few months before starting cemiplimab or avelumab. However, in some patients with aggressive disease it may be necessary to start despite the risks, as the authors appreciate that a substantial number of patients get long-term control of their advanced cSCC or MCC.\u2022The need for systemic steroids in single agent PD1/PDL1 inhibitors is relatively low. The main risk is posed by repeated visits to hospital and a theoretical risk of an increased cytokine response to COVID-19 (no data currently available).\u2022For patients already receiving palliative immunotherapy or chemotherapy, stopping treatment or increasing the gap between cycles should be considered, given the risk of the virus infection and immune status of the patients. NICE guidance has recently relaxed the 12-week break rule, allowing patients who have a break of more than 12 weeks to restart their treatment [3].\u2022In some patients, best supportive care may be the most appropriate treatment given the circumstances.\n",
