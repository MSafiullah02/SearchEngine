The largest of these is the People\u2019s Republic of China (thereafter called China). In 2017 China reported no indigenous malaria cases for the first time since malaria became a notifiable disease in 1956 [2,3]. The country has experienced a major decline in the burden of malaria, from an annual incidence of 24 million cases (2961 cases per 100,000) in 1970 [4]. This reduction has been attributed to a combination of socioeconomic improvements and the scale-up of interventions to control malaria [5]. In 2010, China set out an ambitious plan for the national elimination of malaria by 2020 (the National Malaria Elimination Programme, NMEP). Elements of the plan included improved surveillance, timely response, more effective and sensitive risk assessment tools and improved diagnostics [6]. A key policy change implemented in 2010 as part of the NMEP was the introduction of the 1-3-7 system: aiming for case reporting in one day, which is then investigated within three days, with a focused investigation and action taken in under seven days [7].",

Large numbers of people move between China and malaria endemic countries, both from sub-Saharan Africa and from South East Asia [8,9], driven by tourism and Chinese oversea investment [10]. Concerns remain about re-emergence of malaria, which has occurred several times in the early 2000s as a result of importation and favourable climatic conditions for competent vectors [11]. Therefore, in order to achieve three consecutive years of zero indigenous cases (the requirement for WHO certification of elimination), a sustained and targeted investment in surveillance together with efficient treatment is necessary.",

The province shares borders with Myanmar, Vietnam and Laos and has a strong agricultural focus. Previous studies suggest that seasonal agricultural workers and farmers are at highest risk of contracting malaria in Yunnan, with rice yield and the proportion of rural employees being spatial factors positively associated with malaria incidence [17]. The border region of Myanmar and Yunnan is generally ecologically suitable for malaria transmission, has a large mobile population, with few natural geographic borders separating the two countries, as well as being a site of socio-political conflict and instability [18]. In this context, it can be unclear if there is any sustained local transmission or if all the observed cases are the result of short, stuttering transmission chains following importation into suitable areas. As the area of highest concern for re-emergence in China and the last to reach zero cases, we therefore sought to characterise the transmission dynamics of both Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum in the region as China approaches elimination certification.",

In near elimination contexts with strong surveillance systems, traditional metrics of malaria such as parasite prevalence are not appropriate due to small numbers and extremely sparse and spatiotemporally heterogeneous distributions of infections. However due to the strength of the surveillance system in China, detailed information is available about each individual case (including the time of symptom onset and location of residence), and case reporting is believed to be very high. By adapting and applying a diffusion network approach [22] within a Bayesian framework, we quantify case reproduction numbers [23], Rc, and uncertainty in these estimates for all P. vivax and P. falciparum cases of malaria recorded in Yunnan province between 2011 and 2016. We incorporate these estimates into geostatistical models and an additive regression model to estimate how Rc varied over space and time which we use to estimate timelines to elimination and likelihood of resurgence.",

The mean Rc value estimated for P. vivax during this period was 0.171 (95% CI = 0.165, 0.178) and 0.089 (95% CI = 0.076, 0.103) for P. falciparum cases (S1 Fig).

No Rc values above one were observed after 2014 for either species. These findings are consistent with varying levels of uncertainty about the serial interval distribution (S2 Fig).

The border area neighbouring Myanmar, where most cases were observed, had the lowest amount of uncertainty in the estimates. P. falciparum shows a decline in risk of Rc > 0 across the province, with the more isolated areas in the north of the province showing both the highest predicted risk but also the most uncertainty, due to a lack of cases observed there (S5 Fig). The main sources of uncertainty were small data sizes (Bernoulli observations) and clustered spatial locations. By 2016 all areas were estimated to have reached a low risk, although there is uncertainty in these estimates compared to P. vivax, due to the smaller sample size.",

Our results suggest that transmission in this province decreased rapidly between 2011 and 2016 as shown by a declining risk of Rc exceeding zero across the province. This decline is relatively robust to assumptions about the serial interval distribution. Extrapolating this trend produces an estimated mean Rc of 0.005 by 2020.",

However, as all data analysed was collected whilst the NMEP was in place, we cannot draw conclusions about the impact of scaling back interventions or consider other counterfactuals. There is also some uncertainty in our estimates of current and future Rc, although the 95% credible intervals of these estimates remain below 1. It is important to note that even with low Rc values it is still possible for locally-acquired cases to occur following importation, however the probability of sustained chains of transmission decreases as Rc decreases. There also is more uncertainty in our estimates of risk in areas that have not observed many cases. It is difficult to determine whether an absence of cases is due to a lack of detection, a lack of importation events occurring or a low underlying receptivity to transmission. However, it is worth noting that the greatest uncertainty in our spatiotemporal risk estimates of Rc>0 tends to be in areas of high elevation (elevation > 3000m), where there is unlikely to be transmission. Given the large numbers of imported cases, it is important to highlight these uncertainties and ensure control measures are maintained. Nonetheless, our findings are promising for China to meet their 2020 elimination goal. Our results highlight the success the country has had in malaria control and highlights the difficulty of elimination certification in contexts where both distant and local cross border importation is common.",

This is interesting to note, as the March/April increase in Rc would be expected to occur prior to an increase in incidence, however the second apparent peak in Rc is not reflected by an increase in incidence in the months following. This pattern could be an artefact of human movement, with both periods associated with seasonal movement and holiday periods\u2013the Chunyun period occurs in China for Chinese New Year and the holiday week of the National Day in October and is associated with intranational travel to visit family. During this time, there is often movement from cities to rural areas, and so in these contexts there may be more opportunities for infection to occur as more people are exposed to bites from suitable vectors. This is supplemented by our finding that these specific holidays are associated with small to moderate increases in Rc, however it is worth noting the very wide credible intervals and the great deal of uncertainty associated with these estimates, and therefore caution is required when interpreting this finding.",

For instance, the definition of importation used in case classification is defined by travel to any malaria-endemic areas outside China in the month prior to illness onset. This definition might include people who travelled abroad within the week prior to illness onset, but biologically their infection could not have been obtained during that time given the incubation period. However, in the absence of alternative information, travel history may provide a better indication of the likely importation status of a case than attempting to infer importation without this information, however there could be scope in future work to allow for incorrect travel history. As certification of elimination is now tolerant of introduced (first generation imported-to-local transmission) but not indigenous (second generation local-to-local transmission) cases, being able to differentiate between the two, and understanding how much transmission is indigenous versus imported or introduced is an important area of focus for future work.",

In contexts with a high level of asymptomatic infection contributing to transmission or with poor case detection and/or reporting, these approaches would not be suitable. However, in the context considered here there is good evidence of strong case reporting, investigation and response. The Ministry of Health (MoH) in China has been measuring the timeliness of the recommended protocol and ability to meet the 1-3-7 targets for surveillance, case investigation and management. It was found that the one-day target for case reporting was almost always met because this is required by law. In the years following the introduction of the 1-3-7 policy, the proportion of cases investigated within three days increased from roughly 55% in 2011 to almost 100% by 2013. However the programme took longer to achieve the seven day focal point investigation goals, with just over 50% of foci investigated and treated within seven days by the end of 2013 [7]. Nevertheless, by 2015, adherence to the 1-3-7 strategy improved and this figure increased to an estimated 96% [24].

According to China CDC, Yunnan has achieved full coverage of basic healthcare at village/community level, and local residents and migrants can easily and timely access to health services. Following the National Malaria Elimination Action Plan, hospitals/CDCs provide free antimalarials to cure both local and imported malaria cases found in Chinese residents, mobile populations or foreigners, and pharmacies and non-medical institutions cannot sell antimalarials. Additionally, since China launched the Malaria Elimination Action Plan in 2010, Yunnan Province has special fund to support enhanced malaria surveillance with a high sensitivity, as it was identified as a key province with endemic malaria. The healthcare units at township level are required to screen malaria in febrile patients, so that the possibility of missed diagnosis or underreports of malaria in the patients with fever is likely to be low. Due to the low levels of malaria in China, immunity is likely to be low and therefore asyptomatic infection is less likely. For those who do have no fever or mild symptoms, we assume they have limited capacity to transmit malaria as their gametocyte density is likely to be low. Given the low levels of asymptomatic parasitaemia one would expect in this context, it is unlikely that these infections are contributing much to ongoing infection and therefore affecting our estimates, especially as we do estimate and allow for unobserved sources of infection in our approach.",

According to China's National Malaria Elimination Technology Program (2011), the epidemiological history of each case has been investigated to check the source of the infection and the history of previous infection and relapse malaria. The individual-based data recorded electronically allow us to compare and find out the relapse malaria, but no relapse cases were found during the study. In addition, all malaria cases received free antimalarial treatment, and each case of P. vivax malaria was treated for radical cure. Nonetheless, there is still a small chance of some relapse cases. In our approach we jointly estimate unobserved sources of infection but are agnostic as to the specific cause of the unobserved source, relapses are considered as one of the potential unobserved sources of infection. Although large amounts of relapse are unlikely for the reasons outlined above, if there were very large amounts of relapse, the estimated reproduction numbers could be over-estimated. However, given we find such low reproduction numbers, even if this unlikely situation were the case, this does not impact our key findings and in fact would be stronger evidence of China achieving large reductions in malaria transmission between 2011 and 2016.",

Although contact tracing for indirectly transmitted diseases is more difficult, identifying if the likely source of infection is a breeding site near the home or a place of work is carried out through active case detection schemes, but often the resulting data are not made available alongside line list data. This information could be used to weight certain connections. Genetic data are also increasingly available, and provide useful information about movement of parasites [26,27], the likelihood of two cases being linked by transmission, and can provide useful information to help distinguish imported from local cases and chains of transmission resulting from importation from on-going local transmission [21]. Such data were not available in this context; however, a similar methodological framework or approach could incorporate information such as genetic distance.

In active foci more intensive RACD screening of a larger pool of neighbours and contacts is carried out using Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) for immediate detection, followed by PCR testing of blood spots to detect low-density infections.

            "text": "Taking a similar approach to our previously developed work [20] using a greedy algorithm to estimate the reproduction numbers of malaria cases in El Salvador, we defined a prior distribution of possible serial interval distributions for malaria which were then used in the algorithm. The serial interval distribution of treated, symptomatic P. falciparum malaria, previously characterised using empirical and model based evidence [30,31] was adapted to inform the prior distribution for the relationship between time and likelihood of transmission between cases in China. We analysed P. vivax cases and P. falciparum cases separately. The prior distribution was defined to be flexible enough to reflect both the biology of P. vivax and P. falciparum as well as the dominant vector species in Yunnan (recent surveys in Yunnan province have found Anopheles sinensis to be the dominant vector species in mid-elevation areas and rice paddies and Anopheles minimus s.l. the dominant species in low elevation areas [13,32] and to allow for possible variation in transmission dynamics, for example due to untyped infections or delays in seeking treatment. In addition, there is a possibility of a small number of asymptomatic or undetected and therefore untreated infections contributing to ongoing transmission, which will typically have a longer serial interval. We use a shifted Rayleigh distribution (a special case of a Weibull distribution), to describe the serial interval of both species, which can be varied by changing two parameters: \u03b1 and \u03b3. The parameter \u03b1 governs the overall shape of the distribution, and \u03b3 is the shifting parameter accounting for the incubation period between receiving an infectious bite and the onset of symptoms (Fig 1A). The \u03b3 shifting parameter was fixed at 15 days to account for the extrinsic incubation period within the mosquito and the minimum time between infection and suitable numbers of gametocytes in the blood to lead to symptom onset [33]. The prior for the \u03b1 parameter determining the shape of the distribution was given a Normal distribution with mean 0.003 and standard deviation 0.1 (illustrated in Fig 5), giving an expected time between symptom onset of one case and symptom onset of the case it infects of 36 days, with the parameter value in the 2.5 percentile of prior having an expected serial interval of 21 days and the equivalent parameter from the 97.5 percentile having an expected serial interval of 60 days. By comparison the expected values for treated P. falciparum from existing literature range between 33 and 49.1 days (95%CI = 33\u201369) [30,31]. Depending on how much uncertainty there is in the serial interval (SI) of malaria, the prior for \u03b1, the shaping parameter for the SI of malaria, may be varied. We explored the effects of different priors on the likelihood and posterior estimates. We used the same mean value for \u03b1 (0.003) but set the \u03b1 prior to standard deviation between 1 and 0.01. The results of considering different priors for \u03b1, the parameter shaping SI distribution on estimated Rc values over time is shown in S2 Fig.",
