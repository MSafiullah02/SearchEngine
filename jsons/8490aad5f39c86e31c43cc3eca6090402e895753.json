Polyhedrin and p10 are products from the AcNPV genome and highly accumulated in the late stage of infection [1] . Their transcription promoters allow overproduction of proteins in insect cells. Genes of interest are first inserted between one of these strong transcription promoters (polyhedrin or p10 promoter) and a polyadenylation signal (SV40 or HSVtk polyadenylation signal) in the transfer vector and then integrated into the engineered AcNPV genome. The engineered AcNPV genome containing genes of interest is transfected to cells of the caterpillar Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 or Sf21 cell line.

In the first case, both the linearized AcNPV genome containing a lethal deletion and the transfer vector are cotransfected into insect cells, and recombination occurs between the engineered AcNPV genome and the transfer vector. Because the transfer vector can rescue the lethal deletion of the engineered AcNPV genome, viruses that are generated from the genome fused with the transfer vector propagate. However, practically, this strategy might generate nonrecombinant viruses, which could apparently decrease virus titer (infection efficiency) and gene expression level. In such a case, a virus species with higher titer should be isolated from a single plaque by a plaque assay, which may require additional time and effort. This step can be bypassed when genes of interest are integrated to the engineered AcNPV genome in E. coli cells, applying the transposing reaction of the Tn7 transposon [2] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1031, "end": 1034, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The Tn7 transposon is a relatively large DNA segment (14 kb) from the Tn7 phage, which can be integrated into a specific position called the Tn7 attachment site (attTn7) in the E. coli genome with high frequency. Tn7 transposon encodes a Tn7 transposase complex, which catalyzes the insertion of DNA elements containing the specific sequences Tn7L and Tn7R into the attTn7 site of another DNA molecule. As the transfer vector containing Tn7L and Tn7R is introduced to specific E. coli strains with a copy of the engineered AcNPV genome containing attTn7 and a helper plasmid encoding the Tn7 transposase complex, the transfer vector is transposed to the attTn7 site of the engineered AcNPV genome in the E. coli cells. Because the attTn7 site in the engineered AcNPV genome is located in the middle of lacZ\u03b1, positive clones (i.e., E. coli cells containing the transposed AcNPV genome) are easily selected by standard blue-white selection in the presence of X-Gal and IPTG.

Differences in the expression level among individual subunits may result in the failure of homogeneous complex formation.

Therefore, donors can be retained in pir-negative E. coli strains only when they are fused with acceptors. Propagation of donors in pir-negative E. coli strains indicates that the donors are appropriately fused with acceptors. This is an important feature because E. coli cells can retain two or more independent (i.e., unfused) plasmids with distinct antibiotic markers simultaneously in the presence of the antibiotics.

Higher-resolution analysis of complex structures requires more homogeneous samples in terms of size, composition, and posttranslational modification and conformation, which typically require the removal of specific subunits and/or modification of the individual subunits by sitedirected mutations and/or trimming regions that are predicted or experimentally shown to be flexible or disordered.
