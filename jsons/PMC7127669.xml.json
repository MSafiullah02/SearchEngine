            "text": "Brucellosis is a zoonotic bacterial disease caused by the genus Brucella. It comprises twelve species, B. melitensis, B. abortus, B. suis, B. ovis, B. canis and B. neotomae, B. ceti, B. pinnipedialis, B. microti, B. inopinata, B. papionis and B. vulpis [[1], [2], [3]]. The disease was eradicated in several countries by the implementing eradication programs, disease surveillance and control of disease spread. However the disease remains enzootic in many regions around the world [4]. There are numerous methods to detect brucellosis in animals. Isolation, identification, and bio-typing of Brucella spp. is considered the \u2018gold standard\u2019 method, and is useful for epidemiological studies, genotyping and molecular characterization. Serological tests, such as agglutination tests, complement fixation test (CFT) and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are widely used for the diagnosis of animal and human brucellosis in several countries worldwide. These test are also used for international trading purposes [5,6]. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been used for the diagnosis of human and animal brucellosis and for direct detection of the pathogen in contaminated food products [7]. In addition, multiplex PCR methods have been developed to identify six classical species and subtypes isolated from marine mammals and some vaccine strains [8,9]. Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms PCR (RFLPs-PCR) has been used for typing Brucella spp. for taxonomic and epidemiological studies [9]. Real-time PCR has also been used for the diagnosis of Brucella spp. infection in humans and animals from blood, urine and embedded tissues in paraffin wax [10]. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has been used for the diagnosis of Brucella spp., in infected mouse organs and contaminated milk [11].",

For this reason, simple and rapid techniques are needed for the detection of Brucella in veterinary clinics. For establishment of successful control and eradication programs, reliable diagnostic techniques are needed for surveillance and investigation of disease outbreaks. Current bacterial isolation procedures and identification assays are time-consuming, require experienced technicians and put the laboratory personnel at risk [13]. Furthermore, current assays are affected by the number of viable bacteria in the samples and may be influenced by other bacterial and fungal contaminants [14]. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is an isothermal amplification method performed at temperatures between 37 and 42 \u00b0C. The assay can rapidly detect target nucleic acids without the need for sophisticated laboratory equipment. It can detect very low concentrations of pathogen-specific nucleic acid within 20 min [15].",

In addition, RPA has been developed to detect Brucella spp. in point-of-care diagnosis assays [17]. Additionally, the lateral-flow RPA has been developed to detect several pathogens. It is considered as a rapid and sensitive technique. This type of RPA does not need sophisticated instruments. Using lateral flow, dipstick strips could evaluate the sample after an incubation period of 10\u201330 min at fixed temperatures [18]. In this study, Real-time and Lateral Flow Dipsticks was used to develop an, RPA assay for the rapid detection of Brucella spp.\n",

The DNA polymerases extend and displace from 3\u2032-ends of the primers and cleaved probe to produce the minor amplicons (from the forward and reverse primers) and a displaced strand. The displaced strand combines with the labelled reverse primer, and leads to the production of a dual-labelled amplicon bound with FAM at 5\u2032 end and Biotin at 3'end (the major amplicon) also called FAM-Biotin linking amplicons [20]. Lateral flow dipstick strips are made of permeable membrane. It has sample pad to dip in diluted RPA product with appropriate buffer, this pad contains gold nanoparticles ligated with Anti-FAM antibodies. Upper to sample pad there is a line contains another immobilized antibody captures biotin, this forming the test line, and after the test line there is control line contain immobilized anti-species antibodies captures that antibodies ligated to gold nanoparticles. In positive reactions anti-FAM antibodies will bind to FAM in dual labelled amplicons, and then diffuse to test band line. In the test band line anti-biotin will bind biotin and form red line. The remaining gold Nano-particles will diffuse to control line to be captured by anti-species antibodies and form another red control line. In the positive result, test and control lines will be visible in LF-strip. In negative reactions the double-labelled products are absent, and will not bin with anti-FAM and anti-biotin in test line, and gold nanoparticles will diffuse to control line to form red band only in control line [19].

The reproducibility of the assay is shown in Appendix A (Fig. S3 A and B) and Appendix B (Tables S1 and S2). Regression analysis showed that the coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.8821 of the serially diluted plasmid and its respective time threshold values by RT- RPA-BP26. The mean R2 of the colony forming units and RPA threshold time values was 0.9892, exhibiting good correlation between the starting templates and threshold time values.

In addition, these samples should be from different species. The detection window of two assays should be determined by experimental models.

Despite the high cost of the test kits, this technique could be used in field and point of care with a short turn-around time and could be performed in laboratories that lack specialized instruments. In addition, the kits and instruments to perform RPA could be easily transported and used in the field as well as in mobile veterinary clinics. However, RPA reagents are expensive and are only produced by a single manufacturer [38]. Reducing the cost of the reagents will help increase the availability of the RPA kit to testing centers and veterinary clinics with limited budgets.",
