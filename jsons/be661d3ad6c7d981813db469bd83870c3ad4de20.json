Public sentiment reflects the ideas, attitudes, opinions and emotions that people express on certain noticed issues. Positive public sentiment is often a necessary prerequisite for political action, and vice versa; negative public sentiment may become a major obstacle for a correct decision (Burstein, 2010) . In this situation, public sentiment plays an increasingly important role in policy making processes in many areas such as public health, food safety, and large-scale projects where public perceptions can be misplaced (Jiang, Lin, & Qiang, 2016) . Typical examples include incidents like \"the adoption of the MMR vaccine has been opposed due to the publicity indicating an erroneous link between the vaccine and autism\" (Godlee, 2011) , \"China's milk powder industry had seriously declined due to the public sentiment of the Sanlu milk powder incident\" (Chen, 2009) , \"5G mobile phone masts have been vandalised caused by a false link with the coronavirus\", and \"Nuclear fuel processing project has been cancelled because of an anti-nuclear public sentiment in Guangdong province of China\" (Weiwei Li; .",

In the public health areas, several epidemiologic studies found that MMR vaccine was not associated with an increased risk of autism even among high-risk children whose older siblings had autism. Despite strong evidence of its safety, some parents are still hesitant to accept MMR vaccination of their children due to the fake scientific report and news (DeStefano & Shimabukuro, 2019) . To characterise and evaluate the dissemination of information to the community during a suspected TB outbreak, a model of effective information dissemination in a crisis was developed through a study of information dissemination during the incident (Duggan, 2004) . In the food safety area, Lyu identified and compared the crisis communication strategies that organizations used to respond to a congenetic melamine-tainted milk crisis and public opinion in two Chinese societies (i.e., Mainland China and Taiwan) and found that Sanlu (a Mainland China-based organization) and KingCar (a Taiwan-based organization) demonstrated inverse pattern of the strategy adoption (Lyu, 2012) . In the large-scale project area, Jeong used situational communication crisis communication theory and attribution theory to explain the public's responses to a corporation that caused an oil spill accident (Jeong, 2009 ). Sun investigated nuclear power in China from the perspectives of electricity preference and social perceptions and assessed the public Willingness-To-Pay (WTP) to prevent a local nuclear power plant. Research results indicate that the Chinese pay most attention to the development of nuclear energy when they are worried about nuclear accidents (Sun, Zhu, & Meng, 2016) . Following the anti-nuclear event in Jiangmen in Guangdong province, China, Li analyzed the causes and characteristics of nuclear public sentiment in depth and presented some relevant measures for preventing negative public sentiment in the era of new media (Weiwei Li; . Above all, most relevant studies include some significant ideas for our purposes. However, existing research methods are mainly qualitative rather than quantitative and post-mortem analysis rather than real-time decision-making.",

On the one hand, the original events (large-scale projects, major incidents or scandals) which trigger the relevant public sentiments occur with low frequency, and the triggered public sentiments are diverse and non-duplicated. Thus, the key parameters (such as \"posting rate of MicroBlog\") of prior knowledge (such as decision models and data) for describing or predicting the scenarios of public sentiment systems are difficult to obtain in time. On the other hand, interdisciplinary and dynamic original events lead to the features of feedback, nonlinearity and instability of the relevant public sentiment systems. This also means that the key parameters of the decision models are adjusted over time. Therefore, it is more difficult for policy makers to build a quantitative evolutionary model and make an effective response decision based only on previous decision methods.",

The SD methodology is used to develop some increasingly complex models to investigate the process of innovation diffusion and enhance insight in the problem structure and increase understanding of the complexity and the dynamics caused by the influencing elements (Maier, 1998) . A diffusion model is employed to extend commonly used epidemic models in the study on analyzing dynamics of intra-organizational innovation implementation processes. The SD modelling and simulation results of this study provides structural explanations and offers insights into why, given various intra-organizational networks, management policies can make different results on whether and how innovations are adopted in an organization (Wunderlich, Gr\u00f6\u00dfler, Zimmermann, & Vennix, 2014) . Furthermore, by applying system dynamics, Yu proposed a simulation model to study the public sentiment diffusion mechanism in dangerous chemical pollution water emergencies and discover effective response strategies (Yu Le-an et al. 2015) . His research shows that the SD modelling methods are useful for describing, understanding and simulating the complex public sentiment diffusion systems and for making relevant optimization policies. More importantly, compared with decision-making theories based on large amounts of historical data, SD has the advantage of being able to predict the future based only on system structure. Therefore, when one lacks historical data, most complex social systems can be described and analysed using SD method (Morgan, Howick, & Belton, 2017 ).",

Thus, the second bottleneck (dynamic of public sentiment evolution) may be resolved based on both PCM theory and SD method. After building and running the artificial SD simulation system parallel with the public sentiment system, evolutionary scenarios can be predicted and effective response policies can be provided by decision-makers. Therefore, a novel decision-making method \"Parallel Evolution and Response Decision Framework for Public Sentiment (PERDFPS)\" based on the theories of PCM and SD is proposed as a specific contribution of this paper. This method is structure-dependent rather than data-dependent and can be implemented in real-time, which makes it helpful to simulate, analyze and guide the evolution processes of dynamic public sentiment in the case of lack of historical knowledge on less-frequently occurring original events. The paper is organized as follows for achieving the contribution. Section 2 proposes the PERDFPS framework. And section \"3 Methodology\" is developed to abstract and present the PERDFPS methodology with a roadmap (Table 1) helping decision makers effectively use the novel method. Furthermore, the section \"4 Empirical research\" shows a whole case study to deduce the principle and verify the effectiveness of the PERDFPS method using the anti-nuclear mass incident in Jiangmen, China. Lastly, theoretical discussions, the limitations and future studies are presented in section 5.",

Moreover, within this framework (Fig. 1) , according to the \"scenario-response\"-based emergency management paradigm (Ba\u00f1uls, Turoff, & Roxanne, 2013) , the Public Sentiment System (PSS) can be divided into two subsystems: the Real Scenario System (RSS) and the Simulation Decision-making System (SDS). As the source of real-time information, real scenarios are the basis for decision-making as well as the targets of public sentiment control. The original events, sentiment disseminators and sentiment regulators are the essential elements of the real scenario system. The original events (such as public health emergencies, food safety scandals and large-scale projects) may easily trigger relevant public sentiment. Public sentiment disseminators include the media, netizens, and others. The media triggers and influences the processes of public sentiment propagation through reporting and directing the news. In addition, netizens use social networks to express and communicate their own opinions, which results in the continued diffusion and evolution of public sentiments. Because the collective behaviours of the netizens comprehensively reflect their attitudes towards source events, their support or opposition are essential factors for the government in making an efficient response decision. Generally, the government response departments dealing with the emergencies or large-scale projects assume the greatest responsibilities as public sentiment regulators. By taking measures such as holding lectures and seminars, press conferences on the events, and by releasing positive news, they supervise, guide and even control the development of the public sentiments.",

In the first step, using real-time perception (which includes the processes of information collecting, analysing and abstracting), the characteristic elements of the public sentiment system, including source events, sentiment disseminators and sentiment regulators, can be extracted from real scenarios. Based on the SD method, the Causal Loop Diagram model is suitable for describing the relationships between the elements of public sentiment systems. In addition, after setting the parameters and calculating rules, the Stock Flow Diagram model, which is based on the qualitative Causal Loop Diagram model, can be built to describe the dynamic system structure and simulate its functional mechanism quantitatively. In the second step, simulation results of public sentiment diffusion and evolution at a future time can be obtained by importing real-time status data perceived from real scenarios into the Stock Flow Diagram model and running it. Next, to keep simulation models consistently parallel with real scenarios, decision-makers should dynamically adjust the parameters and structures of the Stock Flow Diagram models by observing and analysing the running effect of models and the real-time status of the scenarios. In this way, the validity and reliability of the simulation results of the SD Stock Flow Diagram model can be gradually improved. In the last step, given a reliable SD model, different response strategies or policies can be tested, verified and optimized in the simulated environment.",

If there is a public sentiment scenario very similar to the current scenario through the perspectives of event type and system structure, the relevant simulation model of the scenario is chosen as the initial model \"1-generation SD Model.\" However, there are usually no extremely similar scenarios for a non-duplicated public sentiment event. In that situation, the parameters of the initial equations of the 1-generation SD model can refer to the developed models of historical cases which are similar with the current event in type, system structure and situation. Regarding the historical cases, it is very difficult to find the most similar one in an emergency situation. We can still improve and cultivate our models iteratively by adjusting them in parallel with the real-time scenarios even if the selected historical case is not identical to the current public sentiment event. Of course, the more similar a selected historical case is, the less iteration there will be, so the improved decision-making model will be obtained quickly.",

In the entire parallel controlling process, the real time information from the various stages of the real scenarios (from Scenario 0 to Scenario n) should be collected, integrated, and analyzed at a specific time-interval, \"\u25b3t\". At the same time, modifying processes such as parameter refitting and data updating can be used to continually improve the simulation models from \"1-generation SD Model\" to \"n-generation SD Model,\" ensuring that simulation results are consistent with the real scenario in the parallel evolution processes. Regarding the parameter fitting into the model cultivating process, we constructed the 1-generation SD model and the other n-generation SD models in different ways. Take the case shown in the empirical part of this paper as an example. On the one hand, most of the equations of the 1-generation SD model based on the literatures (Tian, 2011), (Weiwei Li; , (Zhang, 2012) and (Yu Le-an, Li Ling, Wu Jia-qian, 2015) are obtained using parameter fitting with the data of 36 similar cases such as the \"Sanlu milk powder incident\" from \"people.com.\" On the other hand, for the n-general models, we do not have to fit the parameters to improve the equations. Only real-time data needs to be collected to draw the curves of the key state variables such as \"Increment of posts\" and \"Increment of news\" during the time-interval (\u25b3t = 24 hours). After contrasting the simulation results of the n-generation model and the scenario n, the parameters of the equations are adjusted and the model is improved to approach the real scenario in an iterative and parallel way. When an n-general model and its simulation results are consistent with the real scenarios, it means that the model has passed reality testing and has become a cultivated model. optimal strategy can be obtained by adjusting the control variables. As shown in the stock and flow diagram model (Fig. 6) , the interactions between these system variables drive the evolutions and diffusions of public sentiments and decide the final results of the original events, as seen through the attitudes of people.",

The announcement of the result of the social stability risk assessment of the nuclear project is considered the source event of the media module of this public sentiment system. In addition, by choosing and analyzing the increment data of Baidu news and Xinlang Blog posts (Fig. 3) during July 5-19, 2013, and the relevant government response measures (Table   2 ), the key parameters of the initial stock flow diagram model and the initial data of the simulation process of public sentiment evolution can be extracted gradually. Due to the actual evolution cycle of public sentiment lasting only 15 days, it is too short to prepare enough data and develop a reasonable simulation trend. The simulation model is thus set for running 12 hours per day. Therefore, the simulation cycle is translated or expanded from 15 days to 240 hours. The main data used in this paper is collected from references and websites (Weiwei Li; CNSA, 2015) . Moreover, some variables or parameters of the model should be adjusted according to the demand of the actual simulation experiment. For example, some unstructured behaviour data, such as government response behaviours, should be ranked into the qualified and controllable variables Quantity of government response or Increment of government response. Note that the data shown in Figure 8 are considered unknown information at the beginning of the simulation experiment and will be revealed gradually during the simulation processes. In fact, this primary data is used to verify the reality and validity of our parallel simulation model by describing the real scenarios and comparing them with the artificial ones. Therefore, the decision problem of this case is structure-dependent and can be described and solved with the PERDFNPS method based on the 6 hypotheses proposed in section 3.

Professor Zhou also publicly declared that \"the whole nuclear fuel processing in the Jiangmen base project does not relate to the nuclear fission reactions\" (Weiwei Li; . However, due to the high threshold of nuclear technologies, it is very difficult for most people to quickly and effectively understand the safety of nuclear energy and accept nuclear projects. The blind worries regarding crises stemming from nuclear projects are one of the main reasons for triggering and spreading negative public sentiment and ultimately terminates potential projects.

Therefore, the evolution trend of the variable \"quantity of support posts\" impacted by the combination strategy E is compared with the trends impacted by the strategies R0, A4 and D4 respectively in Figure 10 . The comparison shows that the quantity of support posts increases significantly with the strategy A4 (much more times of government response) or the strategy D4 (much higher degree of popularity of nuclear knowledge). However, it can be seen in Table 3 that the percentages of support posts are still lower than percentages of support posts with the two single strategies separately in the end of simulation. However, the comparison also shows that the quantity of support posts increases much more significantly and rapidly using strategy E rather than A4 or D4. It can also be shown in Figure 12 that strategy E leads to a higher percentage of support posts than percentage of opposite posts, which presents a reversed public sentiment simulation result that the approval rating is higher than disapproval rating for this nuclear-related project. Therefore, the government is able to guide and control the evolution and development of public sentiments more effectively in such a scenario by using the combination strategies.",

Therefore, in the next step, more elements, features, and other details of public sentiment systems, such as opinion leaders and their impacts on the public sentiment, should be designed and simulated to make decision-making models more realistic and effective in practical response processes. Furthermore, due to the similarity of the system structures, the novel approach can be used in the public sentiment events not only in the nuclear related field but also in many other fields, such as food safety and healthcare. Once events break out, the public sentiment systems can be constructed rapidly using little initial data and improved on iteratively and dynamically with real-time data. Using this framework, decision makers are able to describe, rehearse and make the proper decisions to guide or control the evolution trends of the public sentiment effectively. Therefore, in future studies, the PERDFPS framework and the relevant SD models can be extended to some other social heat incidents with similar public sentiment system structures such as \"vaccination scandals\" and \"food-safety scandals.\"",

The public sentiment system can be divided into original events and three interactional modules according to the different roles of the sentiment disseminators (Yu Le-an, Li Ling, Wu Jia-qian, 2015): the media module, the government module, and the netizen module. Firstly, the media module: Once a food safety scandal, public health incident or large-scale project does happen, it is easily noticed and reported by (Internet) media. Media plays a major role in guiding public opinion and can influence the evolutionary processes of public sentiments by affecting the attitudes of netizens regarding the original events. At the same time, the media's behaviours are monitored by the government and influenced by the opinions or sentiments of netizens. Secondly, the government module: Most public health policies and large-scale projects are proposed or supported by governments. Then, once a large-scale project begins or a public health incident occurs, the relevant government departments should take effective emergency response measures (such as open information, popular science propaganda, releasing the official news, setting laws",

It also means these hypotheses are tenable. Otherwise, if a simulation result of the SD model is different from the real scenario, the simulation model should be improved by persistent parameter adjusting and contrasting.

To achieve the improvement process, the variables of the SD model are classified into two categories, including state and control variables. Most of the variables are uncontrollable state variables from the perspective of government, such as Increment of posts and news Increment. This kind of variable is used to show the current state and evolutionary trend of the public sentiment system. The other variables, such as \"times of government response\" and \"response time of government,\" are controllable.

The loops illustrate that, after the source event happens, the quantity of posts increases because of netizens' large-scale micro-blog posting behaviours. The increment of posts, which includes the increment of support of posts from project supporters, the increment of opposite posts from project opponents and the increment of neutral posts from neutral netizens, gradually contribute to the total quantity of the posts. In addition, under the influence of the combined effects of government response actions, the quantity of support posts increases with the accumulation of the increment of support posts, resulting in the accumulation of the total quantity of posts. Similarly, under the negative effects of social panic caused by potential nuclear safety problems, the quantity of opposite posts increases with the accumulation of the increment of opposite posts; as a result, the total quantity of posts increases. The accumulation process of the neutral posts is similar to the processes of the support and opposite posts. The increase in total quantity of posts also means an increase in the participation degree of netizens and the promotion of the heat rate of public sentiment, which also might lead to a further increase in the increment of posts.",

Once a nuclear event does occur, the government enhances their supervision and takes other effective measures, such as open information and popular science propaganda, to guide and control the situation. With this increase in government measures, the combined effects of government response increase, which leads to an increase in the increment of support posts, and a decline in the heat rate of public sentiment. With the combined effects of this negative feedback loop of the government module, the diffusion and evolution of nuclear public sentiments can be effectively guided and controlled.In the above causal loop diagrams, the government's emergency response measures are synthetically considered into the increment of government response. In addition, the variables in degree of government response, credibility of government and degree of popularity of nuclear knowledge also lead to weighted impacts on the combined effects of government response actions.Under normal circumstances, an obvious positive relationship exists among the three variables. The degree of government response comprises quantitative response actions, including supervision and intervention. Government credibility means public appeal and influence and reflects the people's trust in and satisfaction with their government's response. Thus, government credibility is affected by the degree of information transparency and the degree of response satisfaction in the causal loop diagrams.The degree of popularity of nuclear knowledge is used to describe the extent of people's basic knowledge regarding a nuclear accident, nuclear radiation and nuclear safety. Usually, government response actions are acceptable and have a positive effect if most local people have sufficient nuclear knowledge. Moreover, the degree of response satisfaction indicates the extent to which the result of the response actions is acceptable and satisfactory to local people.4.2.2 Stock and flow Diagram modelThe SD stock and flow diagram model of the nuclear public sentiment system",

In addition, the variable Degree of panic is decided by the variables Degree of viewpoint collision together with Positive and negative effects of posts. The functions describing the above variables and evolution rules are set as formulas (7-12). Additionally, as the accumulations of the above variables, the variables Quantity of support posts, Quantity of opposite posts, Quantity of neutral posts and Quantity of posts are defined as formulas (13-17). (3) Stock Flow diagram model of the government module. According to the articles and reports about this anti-nuclear mass incident (Weiwei Li; et al. 2015; CNSA, 2015), the government response measures, such as open information, popular science propaganda, releasing the official news, establishing laws and regulations and holding a press conference, can be considered as the decision-making control variable \"Times of government response\". The variable Increment of government response is decided by the variable Average degree of government response (formula 20). At the same time, due to the influence of delays in response time, it is subject to the variable Response time of government, so that the representation of the variable Increment of government response is defined as formula (18). As the accumulation of the Increment of government response, the variable Quantity of government response, which reflects the government's participation degree in this incident, is defined as formula (19). In addition, referring to the similar evolution mechanism of public sentiment (Yu Le-an, Li Ling, Wu Jia-qian 2015; Zhang 2012), the variable Combined effects of government response actions is decided by the combined variables Degree of popularity of nuclear knowledge and Credibility of government. Moreover, the variable Credibility of government, which is subject to the variables Response time of government, Degree of information transparency, Degree of panic and Times of government response, is described as formula (21). The variables of the SD model are classified into two categories: state, parallel cultivating control and decision-making control variables. Each type of variable has relevant functions in the model.
