Code stroke protocols were maintained, including neurointerventional procedures. Replacement of generators from nerve stimulators was also continued. Scheduled hospitalisations were suspended. 2) The neurology in-hospital consultation team was maintained. 3) Telephone consultations were implemented to replace conventional in-person consultations. Electronic prescribing was implemented. Patients with implanted nerve stimulators or drug infusion pumps received special follow-up. 4) Essential treatments continued to be administered at the neurology day hospital. Botulinum toxin administration was temporarily suspended. Immunosuppressive treatments were postponed in cases where the patient's situation allowed for this. 5) Contact was made almost on a daily basis with emergency department and inpatient ward staff responsible for patients with COVID-19 in order to determine the number of additional physicians needed.",

Clinical research has temporarily been suspended with the exception of special cases. Undergraduate teaching, which was suspended in February, has continued through the Virtual Campus of the Universidad Complutense de Madrid. These measures are similar to those implemented in other centres, even under different healthcare systems. 1, 2 In early April, we began to assess how neurological care can return to a situation of normalcy. This transition will probably have to be progressive and include teleconsultations (we are implementing a secure videoconferencing system to improve interaction with patients) as well as conventional in-person consultations. It will be necessary to reintroduce the suspended treatments, avoiding overcrowding of patients and ensuring proper protection, and to return to normal hospitalisation procedures.",
