The architectural models used for this are often designed to satisfy a managerial perspective and neglect more fine-grained issues such as compliance information of bill of materials (BOM) details. As a consequence, there is a mismatch between an architectural model that supports the management of FLOSS dependencies and the models we found in industry. This leads to costly integration operations to ensure license compliance. Many companies develop own tooling to merge documented license information and generate more comprehensive reports about the use of FLOSS in their products. The lack of consistent concepts in the underlining models also causes manual intervention in the dependency management and license compliance processes, which slows down production. The vast, and still increasing, amount of the commercially used open source components additionally complicates the process of license compliance.",

We also studied the ad-hoc solutions to these challenges in the context of the studied company. The main contribution of our paper is a systematic analysis of the challenges related to the tracking and documentation of open source components and dependencies in companies. As a result of our study, the following categories of challenges coupled with their point solutions emerged: -Data Gathering for the Compliance Process -Usage of FLOSS in Products -Custom Reports -SPDX Support -A Central System to Manage Products For each category, we report the current issues discovered in the course of the case study, as well as the solutions found at the studied company supported by the analyzed qualitative data through interview quotes and observatory descriptions. We suggest that the identified challenges and solutions can fit together into a conceptual model that we tentatively call the product (architecture) model, which we will investigate and evaluate in further research aiming for broader generalizability beyond this single-case case study.",

It was explanatory in presenting some reasons why certain issues in product architecture and open source software dependency documentation arise. When addressing the descriptive side of our study the main co-author visited the case study company for direct observation of the current practices in their real-life context. As for the explanatory aspect, we conducted interviews with five employees at the case study company to cover the breadth of issues faced by the people in different roles responsible for product architecture and FLOSS tracking and documentation. We interviewed employees with different views on the usage of FLOSS within the company. The first two were FLOSS compliance managers. The third person was a product owner and covered the role of a user of open source. The next person was a product manager. The last person was a developer and in his role responsible for the company's architecture model which was used for FLOSS compliance.",

The usage of only approved FLOSS components helps to avoid legal compliance risks introduced by unknown components.
