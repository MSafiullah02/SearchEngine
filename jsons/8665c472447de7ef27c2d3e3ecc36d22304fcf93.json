Since its discovery, SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread across the globe.

Nosocomial outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are thought to have played a crucial role in the amplification and spread of these viruses. For MERS-CoV, hospital outbreaks have been responsible for approximately 50% of confirmed human cases, of which around 40% were healthcare workers 5, 6 . Currently the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in health care settings is unclear, as well as risk factors associated with infection in health care settings. During the WHO-China Joint Mission on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 2,055 laboratory-confirmed healthcare workers from 476 hospitals were reported, mostly from Hubei province (88%). Most HCW infections were thought to have been infected within household settings rather than in a health care setting, although conclusive evidence was lacking 3 .",
