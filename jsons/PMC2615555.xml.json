The identification of the T and B cell immune response targets allows the design of antigenic formulations focused on selected epitopes, for instance, promoting more robust responses against subdominant epitopes contained in conserved sequences that do not easily tolerate mutants escape. In addition, it makes it possible to avoid the presence of inhibitory epitopes (Disis et al., 1996), allows the combination of many epitopes from different proteins or organisms (Sercarz et al., 1993) and the avoidance of immunopathogenic epitopes. Hence, immunomics offers a powerful approach to the rational design of vaccines (Sette and Fikes, 2003).",

Among those, ELISPOT offers many positive advantages with regards to characterizing the immune response (e.g. looking at different cytokines and/or subpopulations of cells), by offering some degree of automation, broader options for readouts (e.g., IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and IL-4), the screening of large number of peptides, and rapid results (Anthony and Lehmann, 2003). Although the length of the peptides used in ELISPOT assays can vary from 9 to 20 amino acids, libraries of 15 amino acids (15mers) with an offset of 11 amino acids seem to represent the best compromise between epitope coverage of a protein sequence and the ability to detect CD4+ and CD8+ responses (Kiecker et al., 2004).",

These factors can be highly affected by how the antigen formulations are prepared and presented to the host organism. Therefore, a high-quality characterization of an immunome must include the testing of multiple immunization protocols using antigens inoculated via different routes and doses, with the immune responses tested at different points in time (Assarsson et al., 2007). Since it is nearly impossible to test all the potential antigen formulations and screen all the peptides that might induce responses, it is important to include in the immunome study reductionist approaches that are subjected to fewer variables. One of the most commonly used approaches is the biochemical MHC\u2013peptide binding assay. The direct in vitro evaluation of peptides that can bind MHC molecules, as determined by competition assays, is likely to identify a larger pool of possible epitopes that would not actually bind in vivo, due to various processing and chaperone mechanisms, which are part of the immunodominant shaping mechanisms (Yewdell, 2006).",

Such software is intended to save time and money by allowing investigators to pre-screen the sequence of a protein or a list of peptides for the presence of possible targets for the immune response. Different mathematical models are used in the search for peptides that can bind to MHC molecules with high affinity. These models can be as simple as matrices of frequencies of individual amino acids in a given position in a peptide sequence or as complex as artificial neural network models; this topic has been reviewed elsewhere (Braga-Neto and Marques, 2006).",

The 17D, 17D-213, and 17DD, YF strains used for human vaccination are products of multiple passages of the virulent parental Asibi virus (Galler et al., 1997). The molecular basis of the attenuation has been identified, and all the vaccine strains have been shown to differ from the wild-type virus in a few amino acids (dos Santos et al., 1995, Galler et al., 1997, Jennings et al., 1993, Post et al., 1992). The strain 17D has been successfully used worldwide for more than 65 years. It has an extraordinary record of safety, conferring long-lasting immunity for up to 35 years in as many as 99% of those vaccinated (Poland et al., 1981, World Health Organization, 2003).",

It was recently reported that the YF 17D vaccine can infect dendritic cells (DC) (Barba-Spaeth et al., 2005) and is able to activate innate immune responses through toll-like receptors (TLR) (Querec et al., 2006).",

The peptides E329\u2013337, E331\u2013339, E333\u2013341, and E334\u2013342 were unable to elicit a significant response, as evidenced by the very low numbers or total lack of IFN-\u03b3 SFC after in vitro stimulation with the respective peptides (Figs. 4A, C, E, F). Peptide E330\u2013338, which induced a very strong stimulation after immunization with the 17DD YF vaccine, was less immunogenic when administered as a 9mer peptide emulsified in adjuvant (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the immunization with peptides E332\u2013340 and E335\u2013342 activated relatively higher numbers of IFN-\u03b3 SFC (Figs. 4D and G) then the immunization with E330\u2013338, to the in vitro stimulation with the respective peptides. Of note, peptides E332\u2013340 and E335\u2013343 were able to stimulate the secretion of IFN-\u03b3 in a cross-reactive fashion, in that both peptides could cross-stimulate the IFN-\u03b3 secretion in mice individually immunized with either one of them. Moreover, E332\u2013340 and E335\u2013343 were preferably recognized by splenocytes from mice immunized with the pool of 9mers, as well as those immunized with 15mer E329\u2013343 (Figs. 4H, I). The numbers of IFN-\u03b3 SFC obtained with E332\u2013340 were very high, even with the lowest in vitro concentration of 0.1 \u03bcg/mL (Figs. 4D, G\u2013I), paralleling the avidity curve previously obtained (Fig. 2D). These results further support the possibility that E330\u2013338 and E332\u2013340 are different epitopes and suggest that either processing of the peptides and/or post-translational modifications of the 17DD YF virus interfere with presentation of these epitopes.",

It is important to note that in our simulation, the use of either the list of 15mers or the whole sequence of the envelope protein rendered comparable results, possibly due to the high degree of coverage offered by the scheme of 15 amino acids overlapping 11 (Kiecker et al., 2004).",

However, other related 9mer adjacent peptides were also immunogenic. It has previously been demonstrated that peptides of 8 to 10 amino acids can bind H2b class I alleles (H2-Kb and -Db) (Moutaftsi et al., 2006), and likely this is also true for H2d class I alleles. The ELISPOT assays using decreasing in vitro concentrations of peptides may provide a measure of the avidity between the MHC\u2013peptide complex and the TCR (Hesse et al., 2001). At the same time, this approach can indirectly reflect the affinity of the TCR\u2013peptide interaction (Hesse et al., 2001), which can lead to distinct cell responses, as well as to different degrees of activation (Wilson et al., 2004). Our results showed that 9mer E60\u201368 not only induced the highest number of IFN-\u03b3 SFC but also had the highest dose\u2013response curve, indicating a very high avidity for the MHC\u2013peptide[E60-68]:TCR complex in 17DD YF vaccine immunized mice. Peptide E64\u201372 showed an intermediate level of avidity, while all the other 9mers had a very low avidity, supporting the conclusion that the results can be dependent on the in vitro peptide concentration used in the ELISPOT assays. However, a biological role for the responses that were observed only at high in vitro concentrations cannot be disregarded. The additional binding data showed that peptide E60\u201368 indeed bound the class I allele H2-Kd with very high affinity and that the adjoining peptides, E59\u201367 and E61\u201369, also had a high affinity for H2-Kd, despite the fact that they showed a low dose\u2013response curve in the ELISPOT assays.",

This peptide also failed to induce a strong immune response when used directly in immunization protocols, and its recognition was inhibited when the immunization was performed in the presence of other peptides covering the adjacent amino acid sequences (Fig. 5H). Moreover, E330\u2013338 also had a low affinity in the binding assay. On the other hand, peptide E332\u2013340, which activated about half of the number of IFN-\u03b3 SFC induced by E330\u2013338, showed a very high ELISPOT avidity curve in 17DD YF vaccine immunized mice and had very high affinity for H2-Ld, as determined in the binding assays. Furthermore, peptide E332\u2013340 was able to induce a very strong and dominant immune response when used directly in the immunization protocol with adjuvant (Fig. 4D). These results point out the benefits of performing ELISPOT assays with different concentrations of peptides, after a first round of screening.

Although YF and the dengue virus do not share complete amino acid identity in the 331\u2013339 region of the envelope protein, the presence of a class I epitope at the same position in the envelope protein in both viruses suggests a selective evolution of the immune system to target the same region.",

In fact, Zhao and colleagues have demonstrated that class II epitopes of the SARS coronavirus nucleoprotein are able to support the production of neutralizing antibodies against the virus (Zhao et al., 2007). It is possible that other cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-5 are also secreted in response to other peptides of the envelope protein. Furthermore, the CD4+ T cells activated by peptides of the envelope protein can help support CD8+ T cell cytotoxic clones that are important to the defence against the virus as well as contributing to the memory response (Supplemental Fig. 2) (Johansen et al., 2004, Sun et al., 2004).",

(D) ELISPOT results for the 18 9mers from the envelope of the YF virus tested with CD4-depleted splenocytes; PREDBALB/c was used to analyze the 18 9mer for the presence of class II (I-Ad and I-Ed) binders; all 9mers were tested in binding assays for class I molecules, and those showing an IC50 < 500 nM were considered possible binders. The intersection represents the number of peptides that were positive in two or three of the approaches.",
