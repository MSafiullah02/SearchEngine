            "text": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an invasive, gram-negative bacterium that is known to cause a wide range of acute and chronic infections [3]. P. aeruginosa rarely causes infection in the healthy host, yet it is an efficient opportunistic pathogen that can cause serious infections in patients who have weakened immune systems, e.g., individuals who are immunocompromised, and patients with malignancies or HIV infection [4]. P. aeruginosa is one of the most common nosocomial pathogens and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality for hospitalized patients [5]. It is responsible for approximately 10% of all hospital-acquired infections and has an estimated mortality rate of up to 50% [5, 6]. It is common in ICU patients with chronic disease and/or those who acquire ventilator-associated pneumonia [7\u201310]. Despite the availability of new classes of antibiotics, multidrug resistance to P. aeruginosa has doubled over the past 30 years [6\u201311]. Thus, new approaches are required to prevent and cure P. aeruginosa infections. Vaccination strategies that may confer long-lived adaptive immunity against multidrug-resistant, gram-negative bacterial infections have produced mixed results [12]. However, the investigational vaccine IC43 appeared to be promising based on the favorable safety and immunogenicity profile from previous phase 1/2 studies [13, 14]. In the phase 2 study, IC43 demonstrated a significant immunogenic effect in ventilated ICU patients without safety concerns. In addition, all-cause mortality was reduced versus placebo (more pronounced in patients with infections), although there were no significant differences in P. aeruginosa infection rates [13].",

The fact that there was no convincing signal concerning an effect of the vaccine evaluated on P. aeruginosa infections in the phase 2 trial in addition to the difficulties in interpreting over-infection led to the decision not to screen per protocol for infections in the phase 3 trial. Investigators documented P. aeruginosa infections (e.g., bacteremia, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, tracheobronchitis) or respiratory tract colonization. Organ function (SOFA scores) was assessed at all visits performed at the ICU. In addition, the length of ICU stay after the first vaccination and overall hospital stay were evaluated.

Other trials including critically ill patients observed mortality rates of about 25%, which are lower than the mortality observed in the cohort of this phase 2 study [19]. In this context, it needs to be stated that for sample size calculation of the present IC43 trial, both the differences in mortality rate and the predicted placebo mortality rate at the time point of primary endpoint assessment (day 28) were conservatively estimated lower than observed in the phase 2 study. The missing correlation between the observed mortality benefit and confirmed P. aeruginosa infections in the initial phase 2 trial required a phase 3 trial. In retrospect, probably another phase 2b trial performed in a more selected population at risk (or even colonized with P. aeruginosa) would have been more appropriate.

However, antibody responses were limited at day 7 (i.e., 16.6% SCR), before the second dose was administered. It is possible that the time course of antibody development, even at 2 weeks, is insufficient to influence clinical outcome in acute, critically ill patients. Furthermore, as stated before, the rates of patients with at least one DMC-confirmed P. aeruginosa infection did not differ significantly between the IC43 100 \u03bcg and the placebo group. Instead, there was even a statistically significantly higher rate of respiratory tract colonization in the vaccinated group compared to the placebo group. In the absence of any effect on P. aeruginosa infections, we assume this to be a chance observation, not unlikely given the number of statistical tests. The hypothesis that antibody titers elicited with the IC43 100 \u03bcg vaccine, particularly after the second vaccination, could result in a reduction of P. aeruginosa infections could not be confirmed.

Though the pre-specified nonbinding futility criterion was formally met, the DMC recommended continuation of the trial and the sponsor endorsed the decision. The attributable mortality of P. aeruginosa infection in mechanically ventilated patients is dependent on the severity of illness, susceptibility pattern, and appropriate antibiotic prescription, being estimated to be around 13% [21, 22]. Thus, a 10% reduction in mortality would have been very optimistic, a factor that had been taken into account for the decision to continue. In the second part of the study after the interim analysis, the trend was in fact overturned with higher overall mortality at day 28 in the active treatment group, resulting in an increase of 1.5% when compared to placebo at the final analysis. The absolute mortality rates observed in the interim analysis were well within the 95% CI limits of the mortality rates at the final analysis and were, therefore, not improbable. This is a common problem of phase 3 ICU trials where encouraging earlier analyses were reduced or abolished after larger trials in these complex study populations [23].",

The rationale for not providing antibiotic policies was chosen in order to show the effect of the vaccine on top of general practice antibiotic background therapy in this multinational trial and due to the heterogeneity of susceptibilities and mechanisms of resistance of the pathogen [24] which would require a personalized approach depending of different ICUs\u2019 (52 sites) predominant mechanisms of resistance.",

Furthermore, by including centers from different countries and additional centers than were included in the phase 2 study [13], some of which contributed only few subjects for analysis, it is possible that a change in enrollment of the patient type may have enhanced the variability of the ICU population pool. Heterogeneity of ICU populations is a recognized factor in interventional trials, and while the eligibility criteria were not altered during the current study, possible selection bias through different regional referral patterns may have led to a broader patient selection or earlier/later intervention. In line with these interpretations, the country of residence was shown to be a significant factor for survival/mortality in several regression models. Choosing a clinical and statistically significant improvement in all-cause mortality as the primary endpoint, which is of course very difficult to reach in clinical trials performed in intensive care patients, as well as the lack of an enrichment strategy in order to include a more selected ICU patient population at higher risk for P. aeruginosa may be considered, retrospectively, very challenging for the design of a study protocol.",

A large, randomized trial investigating an S. aureus vaccine administered weeks before elective cardiothoracic surgery failed to reach its primary endpoint [26]. It remains unclear whether vaccine candidates using other S. aureus antigens could be efficacious prophylactically; similarly, some subsets of patients exposed at high risk of P. aeruginosa, such as those requiring prolonged MV for elective surgery, could benefit from preoperative vaccination with other P. aeruginosa vaccine candidates. As stated above, the primary endpoint of the present study was chosen based on the results of the preceding phase 2 study. Clearly, achieving mortality reduction in a broad ICU population would have been interesting, as an impact on mortality is very difficult to demonstrate in critically ill patients. The main reason for continuing the trial after the formal, nonbinding futility criterion was met was that the observed absolute mortality difference of 4.5% represented a clinically important signal bearing the many negative previously performed ICU trials in mind.",
