            "text": "Increasingly, patent pools and clearinghouses are being considered as a tool to facilitate access to large numbers of inventions in the biomedical sector. The biopharmaceutical industry is slowly absorbing the idea that collaborative patent licensing models, such as pools and clearinghouses, could function as an interesting alternative to exclusive single-firm production, simple bilateral licensing or cross-licensing (Box 1, Box 2\n). These models could be particularly useful in situations where many related inventions are patented by many different organizations and where access to these inventions is essential for the development and commercialization of a (new) product. Such situations are commonly referred to as \u2018patent thickets\u2019 [1] in cases where it is cumbersome to safeguard one's freedom to operate (FTO) because the commercial production, marketing and use of a new product, process or service is likely to infringe many existing patent rights owned by many third parties (third party patent rights). To gain access to those third party patent rights, one will need to enter into a multitude of licensing negotiations often leading to an accumulation of royalties (royalty stacking). For some companies or researchers this might be a reason to redesign or completely stop a research project 2, 3, 4. However, others are taking up the challenge to experiment with licensing models that could overcome the negotiation hurdle.Box 1LicensingPatent owners (licensors) can grant licenses giving recipients (licensees) permission to exploit the patent and promising not to bring suit against the licensees for infringing the patent. A person who uses the technology protected by a patent must, provided this activity is not covered by a research exception or other type of exception, request a license. Licenses between two negotiating partners are often called bilateral licenses. It is common to distinguish between in- and out-licensing. In-licensing refers to situations where the organization concerned is the user of the patented technology, i.e. the licensee. Out-licensing refers to situations where the organization concerned is the owner of the patented technology, i.e. the licensor.A cross-license is a special form of bilateral license. In general, it is an agreement between two patent owners where the patent owners grant one another a license for exploitation of the subject matter claimed in the patents concerned. Both patent owners act as licensor and licensee. It can be regarded as a mutual pact not to sue for patent infringement. Cross-licenses are widely used in many technology fields in order to grant reciprocal access to patented inventions. Cross-licenses are often used to settle ongoing disputes, to prevent litigation or to ensure FTO. However, cross-licenses are only proper tools for transferring technology if both parties have \u2018licensable\u2019 objects to offer in return.Box 2Collaborative licensing modelsPatent pools and clearinghouses are often referred to as collaborative licensing models. The effective execution of these models requires the collaboration of many different players, including the licensing entity itself, its staff, patent owners and technology users. In general, bilateral licenses and cross-licenses only concern two contract partners and do not involve a separate \u2018hub\u2019 (the pool or clearinghouse).A patent pool consists of a set of agreements. First, patent owners license their technology to one another, often by way of a multiparty agreement between two or more patent owners. As a result, the pool is established. Second, licenses are bundled into one package license and licensed out by the pool to third party licensees on FRAND terms. The package license can be granted either by one of the patent owners representing the pool or through an independent licensing authority. Patent pools allow interested parties to gain access to all patents to use an invention with one single package license, sometimes called a \u2018one-stop-license\u2019, rather than obtaining licenses from each patent owner individually.Pools also include a \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 function that vets the patents that are pooled. This is needed to ensure that the patents are likely to be valid and enforceable. If there is no vetting procedure, then pool members could run the risk of expensive litigation procedures with an uncertain outcome.\nClearinghouses can be depicted as platforms or intermediaries bringing together owners and users of goods, services and information to lower transaction costs. There are many types of clearinghouses ranging from mere databases of information to technology exchange platforms and royalty-collecting organizations performing many functions 25, 26, 27. The clearinghouse operates as a neutral intermediary or platform for a wide variety of licensable technologies (a type of \u2018supermarket\u2019 for licensable technologies) with substantial expertise in licensing. It matches patent owners and licensees by delivering standard or one-stop-licenses. Licensors benefit from the visibility and expertise of the clearinghouse, save negotiation costs and maximize dissemination of their inventions. Licensees gain from clearinghouses through potential economies of scale in search costs and negotiation cost savings. Because licensees are making choices of what to license on a case-by-case basis, there might be lesser demand on a vetting process than in the case of a pool because the infringement liability risk falls on the licensee and not on the clearinghouse. Clearinghouses can also offer additional services related to monitoring, enforcement, royalty collection, royalty distribution and mediation or arbitration in the case of disputes.",

            "text": "For many years, numerous proposals have been made for collaborative licensing models in the life sciences, but most of these have not led to concrete steps. Recently, we have observed a number of endeavors in the life sciences to set up patent pools and clearinghouses. It is still uncertain whether all these projects will succeed because they are still in an early stage, but at least the organizations that drive these initiatives have taken a strong lead and companies seem more supportive of this type of endeavor than in the past. This might be related to a growing interest in open innovation (see Box 3\n) and a stronger push for corporate social responsibility with respect to biopharmaceutical companies, which is also reflected in calls for socially responsible patenting and licensing strategies (E. van Zimmeren, PhD thesis, University of Leuven, 2011) 5, 6.Box 3Collaborative licensing models for facilitating open innovationA trend towards open collaborative innovation appears to be emerging. Although some claim that open innovation is \u2018old wine in new bottles\u2019 [53], others regard open innovation as the new paradigm for fostering innovation in the life sciences [54]. Open innovation is defined as the use of inflows and outflows of knowledge to stimulate and accelerate innovation within firms and organizations, and to expand the markets for the exploitation of innovation by others 55, 56, 57. The central principle of open innovation is that firms can and should use external ideas as well as internal ideas and employ internal and external paths to market as they advance their technology 55, 56, 57.In the life sciences, organizational modes of open innovation are blossoming. Public\u2013private partnerships exemplify such open innovation organizational modes. Public\u2013private partnerships include the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) (http://www.imi-europe.org/), the Centre for Translational Molecular Medicine (CTMM) (http://www.ctmm.nl/) and the Diabetes Genetics Initiative (DGI) (http://www.broad.mit.edu/diabetes/). These examples indicate a growing willingness and openness of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to set up new forms of public\u2013private partnerships in order to make significant advances in the life sciences. Open innovation principles might catalyze commercialization and accelerate innovation in global health. These open collaborative initiatives require active involvement and knowledge spill-overs between companies, customers, suppliers, universities, research institutes, consortia and start-ups. Hence, there is a need for well-tailored IP strategies that support the open spirit of the collaboration, enable knowledge flows, allow for value appropriation and facilitate commercialization. In this respect, collaborative licensing models, operating as one-stop-licensing shops, might be a useful alternative for (one-by-one) bilateral agreements and might further facilitate open innovation.",

The first (known) project for a patent pool in the life sciences was the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pool [7]. The World Health Organization (WHO) set up a network of laboratories to control the disease. As various patent applications were filed by public and private organizations, a patent pool was proposed to prevent disputes, to enhance R&D and to advance the development of vaccines. The relevant (public and private) patent owners had been identified, and principal agreement on the pool had been gained between them. However, the SARS pool is no longer actively pursued because, with no further outbreaks, the economic drive for the formation of the pool has disappeared (J. Simon, personal communication, 21 January 2009). When the initiative was called off, the detailed arrangements for the pool's operation were not yet fully determined and the pool never worked in practice (Table 1).",

This pool would be set up as a separate legal entity to facilitate the manufacture of antiretroviral pharmaceutical products for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, in particular fixed-dose combinations and child-specific formulations, and to provide cheaper second-line treatments for patients who developed resistance to conventional therapies 8, 9, 10. The MPP is now operational. It is strongly supported by the WHO. In September 2010, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) set an important precedent by announcing that it was licensing patents and patent applications related to the protease inhibitor class of HIV medicines to the MPP [11]. Several commercial partners have also expressed their support for the pool. Hoffman-La Roche, Gilead, Sequoia Pharmaceuticals and ViiV Healthcare [a joint venture of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Pfizer] have taken the lead and have entered into negotiations with the MPP. These negotiations are still ongoing. By contrast, several other key patent owners have informed the MPP that, for now, they prefer to focus on their own longstanding efforts to improve access to HIV/AIDS medicines (http://www.medicinespatentpool.org/LICENSING/Company-Engagement); it might be difficult to convince these patent owners to participate.",

This proposal is part of GSK's Open Innovation Agenda, which is aimed at tackling challenges for improving global public health 12, 13, 14. The agenda favors a more flexible approach regarding intellectual property (IP) to overcome the lack of R&D in neglected tropical diseases 12, 13. A pool could boost R&D by enabling access to relevant patented inventions and related know-how. The pool would be restricted to neglected tropical diseases, which by definition do not appear in developed countries. Thus, the market for medicines for these diseases is quite small and not so competitive. This is a major difference with the MPP, which concerns patents related to HIV/AIDS medicines with all the associated risks of parallel importation of medicines produced under a pool license into the developed world. Given this fundamental difference, these pools will probably develop in very different ways.",

The administration of the Pool for Open Innovation against Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) has now been taken over by BIO Ventures for Global Health (BVGH). Hereinafter, the pool is referred to as the BVGH pool (http://ntdpool.org/). BVGH acts as the non-profit independent administrator of the pool offering a database with the available patents and know-how and conducting outreach to potential contributors and licensees. Pool contributors grant worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive licenses to (i) qualified participants with a concrete proposal, and (ii) in accordance with the \u2018de minimis\u2019 standards set by the pool for research, development, manufacture and export of therapeutics for the 16 major NTDs as identified by the US FDA*\nfor sales into LDCs\u2020\nas defined by the United Nations [15]. According to BVGH, these two standards are not intended to be exclusive but aim at safeguarding the quality of the research enabled by the pool. The exact criteria for qualification (e.g. potential licensee's scope of work, the nature of its resources and capabilities) are not public. It is important to reveal these criteria because a lack of transparency might be regarded by some as a way to discriminate certain actors, whereas the whole purpose of the pool is to broaden access and lower costs of access.",

Embracing this line of reasoning, MPEG LA, which administers patent pools in various fields (http://www.mpegla.com/), announced a molecular diagnostics licensing clearinghouse (\u2018licensing supermarket\u2019) in April 2010, now known as Librassay\u2122. Its aim is to aggregate patent rights for existing and emerging tests that could lead to personalized treatment (e.g. in relation to cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, neurological disorders and various hereditary conditions such as hearing loss), and to license those patents non-exclusively for diagnostic use. According to Larry Horn, President and CEO of MPEG LA, MPEG LA has received support for its diagnostic licensing supermarket from different sectors (L. Horn, personal communication, 13 January 2011). Agreements have been concluded with several initial anchor patent owners, and discussions are under way with others. MPEG LA offers three different packages to patent owners. Under the most advanced package, patent owners enter into a commitment to provide their patents or patents applications in the diagnostic field to Librassay\u2122 for a minimum of 5 years. MPEG LA assumes the cost for any enforcement actions that might be necessary based on the interests of the patent owners and licensees enrolled in the supermarket. Patent owners have the option of delegating to MPEG LA the responsibility and costs associated with patent maintenance fees and with continuing patent prosecution. All packages provide patent owners with the opportunity to retain rights for research, education and drug development carried out by, or on behalf, of the patent owner. MPEG LA aims at having the supermarket up and running in the first quarter of 2012 (L. Horn, personal communication, 22 May 2011 and http://www.mpegla.com/main/pid/mds/default.aspx).",

As long as these tests are not available for a reasonable price, the market for personalized nutrition will remain blocked. DSM is seeking partners for the formation of a consortium to finance the start-up of the clearinghouse but has encountered serious difficulties in doing so. Most industry partners are highly risk-averse and seem reluctant to engage in a model they do not know for a market (nutrigenomics) where any commercial success is still quite uncertain (E. van Zimmeren, PhD thesis, University of Leuven, 2011).",

However, it is doubtful whether voluntary participation in a patent pool will generate a critical mass of high quality patents, particularly outside a very specific area, such as neglected tropical diseases or HIV/AIDS [29]. These apprehensions also arise with respect to clearinghouses and they are even more prominent in a for-profit context. Concerns about the lack of a critical mass of high quality patents have also been confirmed as a major point of concern by the respondents in the survey, which will be described below [30]. These issues point to the need to offer additional incentives to patent holders to supply patents to pools in the life sciences. Most pools in the life sciences are initiated by the beneficiaries (the demand side) of the pool (licensees, non-governmental organizations, international organizations, patient groups, etc.). This situation differs from pools in, for example, consumer electronics and telecommunications, where most patent owners have a clear interest in initiating or collaborating with the establishment of a pool because they need licenses for the inventions of the other patent owners in the pool to legally pursue their own product development.",

This might be explained by the fact that many European biopharmaceutical companies are still relatively young and have not yet developed a licensing policy or because they are focusing on upstream research. With regard to the out-licensing profile, a relatively large part of the sample does not know to what extent their organization's patent portfolio is licensed out, 19.8% of the respondents indicate that their organization is not licensing out at all and 24.9% are licensing out no more than 10% of the patent portfolio. It is interesting to compare these results with the findings of Pressman et al. [38]. In their sample, approximately 70% of the patents had been licensed. Yet, their sample was limited to only 19 universities and only covered DNA patents. In this light, we emphasize that in the current survey 18.7% of the sample is indeed licensing out more than 30% of their patent portfolio, which can be considered a significant fraction (16.7% pharmaceutical companies, 30.4% universities and research institutes and 20.3% biotechnology companies).",

Furthermore, respondents from European universities and research institutes and even biotechnology companies tend to presume that their work is covered by a research exception. However, this might not be the \u2018safe harbor\u2019 they think it is: in Europe, the text of the research exception differs substantially from country to country, and, in most countries, there is no case law that clearly defines the scope of the exception [25].

Nonetheless, \u2018rational forbearance\u2019 by patent owners who want to maintain goodwill and ensure access to future inventions, in particular if the damages are likely to be very small, might result in a de facto research exception [38]. We doubt, however, whether this is a stable and sustainable basis for R&D in the life sciences, in particular in view of the fact that an increasing number of lawsuits are based on inventions resulting from academic research licensed out exclusively [45].

The survey does not show any significant difference among the types of organizations involved in pools. However, universities and research institutes appear to have significantly more experience with clearinghouses than biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. It is likely that universities, which primarily are net IP sellers, use clearinghouses to market their technology more effectively than they could do themselves. Universities that try to maximize the use of their patented technology by drawing on the services of intermediaries seem to act in line with the concept of open innovation (Box 3).",

Clearinghouses are rather thought to facilitate licensing out, to generate licensing revenue or to enable organizations to focus on their core activities. The relatively negative perception among part of the respondents largely stems from fears about the loss of control in the bargaining process in setting licensing conditions and the loss of exclusivity. These issues are also mentioned for patent pools, but for clearinghouses some additional weaknesses are stated. First, respondents point to the risk that clearinghouses would not contain valuable, key technologies (\u2018markets for lemons\u2019). It is claimed that patent owners would prefer to manage their valuable patented technologies themselves and leave the \u2018lemons\u2019 (e.g. low quality patents, unmarketable technologies) to clearinghouses.

Informing stakeholders about the features of such models and their benefits and shortcomings is essential to take well-informed decisions in setting up such collaborative licensing models. In this respect, further research on the compatibility of different institutional designs and licensing schemes with competition law and on their economic viability is desirable. In particular, research on the compatibility of exclusive licenses for very specific fields of use, customized licensing terms and qualification criteria with the obligation in competition law for pools to adopt non-exclusive, fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms (FRAND terms) would be worthwhile. Another interesting topic for research would be the proportionality of the costs of establishing and administering a pool or clearinghouse in relation to the perceived benefits of such models for the life sciences. In other words, to what extent should the patent landscape be fragmented in order to justify the cost and labor intensive establishment of a pool or clearinghouse? What type of additional incentives can and should be used to attract patent owners to participate in a pool or clearinghouse if they believe they can make more money by staying outside those models? In this respect, more detailed case studies of the newly developed pools and clearinghouses once they are more mature will be particularly interesting.",

In the same vein, policymakers and funding agencies (e.g. European Commission, NIH) involved in public\u2013private partnerships in these particular sectors could encourage their partners to apply these models in case of fragmented ownership of patent rights flowing from such partnerships, similar to what the WHO has done in several instances.",

Redesigning some conventional features of pools and clearinghouses might help. For example, the models could be reorganized in such a way that they give more freedom to patent owners to negotiate with licensees within the scope of the respective model, such as the BVGH pool.",

If one stretches the boundaries of the models too far, one might eliminate the significant pro-competitive transaction cost savings and undermine the purpose of the model in the first place. Moreover, one might encounter limitations imposed by competition law. One important issue is that typical one-stop pool licenses should comply with FRAND terms 47, 48, 49. In a pool model where patent owners have extensive freedom to impose qualification criteria and freely decide on the licensing conditions, the prohibition to discriminate in competition law could be particularly problematic. Instead of offering no standard terms at all, it might be better to propose customized menus of licensing terms tailored to the needs of different licensee profiles [50]. This would increase transparency and public trust in the patent pool.",
