Animal biotechnology has been practiced in one form or another since the beginning of the domestication of animals. Previously, the tools used for modification of desired products in animal breeding, genetics, and nutrition have played an important role in the selection, propagation, and management of desirable and economically important characteristics in livestock. Later, it developed some breeding strategies by phenotypic characters for improvement and selection of the desired traits in animals. However, the desired characters could not have been often achieved by such conventional means of breeding and selection (Madan 2005).",

In 2000, the first recombinant protein expressed in transgenic animal was marketed. A number of technical problems remain to be addressed before optimization of different systems for the production of various recombinant proteins (Houdebine 2000). However, the productions of transgenic animals became quite easy due to animal cloning technologies and other advancement in transgenic animal techniques, but the cost of production of such animals is still a major limitation. Different studies on transgenic animal production were performed in the last 15 years with limited transgene expression due to inappropriate construction of expression vectors (Houdebine 2000).",

Recently, animals are considered to develop almost all types of human proteins and proteins of industrial importance (Gottlieb and Wheeler 2011). Previously, assisted reproductive technologies (ART), such as artificial insemination (AI), superovulation (SOV), embryo transfer (ET), and in vitro embryo production (IVEP), contributed to animal breeding programs for faster development of desirable traits in a shorter period of time compared to classical approaches. The use of modern transgenic technologies along with ART to develop livestock with current genomes has played an increasing vital role in the genetic improvement and development of livestock with desired genetic materials. The stem cell technologies inclusion to the genetic \u201ctoolbox\u201d has further improved scientists\u2019 capabilities of livestock genome desired modification and physiology (Wheeler et al. 2010).",

The transgenic animal technology is potentially valuable to alter characters of economic importance in a rapid and precise way.

These alterations will make such products more valuable and desirable for patients suffering from cancer or heart diseases. Moreover, these products can also reduce risk of lethal diseases such as chronic heart disease and cancer with consumption of animal product lower in bad or higher in good fat contents. Some additional benefits can also be achieved along with safe consumption of fat products of transgenic animals such as increased shelf life, or storage of animal fat to avoid rancidity and oxidation. Future development may make it possible to introduce the transgenes, knockout, and knockin with more precision. Issues related to transgenic products still need attention and further improvement is required, such as large-scale production, cost-effectiveness, GMO regulation, and consumer choice.",

As previously mentioned, milk fats may increase the risk of cardiovascular disorders in humans (Soler et al. 2006). The change in major enzymes for fat production can modify the production of fat in the milk. The acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase is a major enzyme responsible for de novo synthesis of milk fat from acetate conversion inside the mammary gland. Almost 50 % of milk fat is synthesized by this method and modification in this enzyme can lead to alter the milk fat contents. The reduction in the quantity of this enzyme would lead to extreme reduction in the amount of fatty acids in milk. Similarly, it would reduce the requirement of dietary nutrition for the production of fatty acids in milk. However, the alteration in the \u03b1-lactalbumin would also be another strategy for modification in milk fat (Yom and Bremel 1993).",

Fat composition depends on the genetics, nutrition of animals, meat cuts, and fat trimming influences (Scollan et al. 2006). In animals, the fat is deposited and localized intramuscularly (marbling) and subcutaneously (Scollan et al. 2006). Oleic acid contributes the most prominent part of the fatty acids present in pig, sheep, and cattle meat, while palmitic acid is the most predominant saturated fatty acid (Scollan et al. 2006). Poultry rearing in free range systems does not produce meat with high fat value, while the poultry with high energy diet can achieve a significant level of fat contents. Breast meat of free range broiler has high poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and mono unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) content, while it is low in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) (Ponte et al. 2008). Poultry skin has more than 40 % fat, while dark meat has 10 %, and white meat has 4 % fat. Poultry meat contains 21 % PUFAs, 45 % MUFAs, and 30 % SFAs (Sayed et al. 1999; USDA 2008).",

The conjugated linoleic acid in milk has been recorded up to 2\u201337 mg g\u22121 , while cis-9 and trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid contents have also been recorded up to 53.7 mg g\u22121 of fatty acid and 51.5 mg g\u22121 of total milk fat (Javor et al. 2008). The concentration of conjugated linoleic acid in animal products has been improved with feed and diet such as fresh pasture, total mix ration contain fish oil or sunflower as feed additive. Furthermore, the breed, age, and lactation number also have little influence on the concentration of conjugated linoleic acid. Interestingly, the conjugated linoleic acid concentration improved after cooking or processing (Javor et al. 2008). Most recent significant discovery of animal fats and fatty acids is related to the conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in association with ruminant milk fats and meat. It has also forced authorities to reconsider the recommendations related to impact of animal fat on public health (Javor et al.2008). Linoleic acid is also a powerful naturally occurring anticarcinogen, antiatherogenic, and immunomodulatory. The National Academy of Science report on carcinogens and anticarcinogens in food declared linoleic acid as the only anticarcinogen fatty acid present in food (Javor et al.2008). In some previous studies, conjugated linoleic acid has successfully suppressed fore-stomach tumors in mice, aberrant cryptic colonic foci in rats, and rat mammary tumors (Javor et al. 2008). Many other saturated fatty acids are neutral inside the human body and do not increase the plasma cholesterol level. Moreover, it has a significant role to alter body fat composition and as a weight reducing agent with reduction in animal fat deposition in body by increasing the rate of lipolysis in adipocytes (National Research Council 1996; Javor et al. 2008).",

In addition, modern biotechnological techniques make this possible to put useful fatty acids in transgenic animals such as polyunsaturated fatty acids. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUAFs) contain 18 or more than 18 carbon atoms; and two or more than two double bonds. PUAFs two major groups are omega-6 (n-6) and omega-3 (n-3), on the basis of double bond near the methyl end of fatty acid. Polyunsaturated fatty acids n-3 and n-6 are important constituents of phospholipids in the tissues throughout the body. PUFAs n-3 is especially enriched in the retina and brain (DeFilippis and Sperling 2006; Simopoulos 2006). Mammals lacking in desaturase require the synthesis of linolenic acid (n-6) and alpha linolenic acid (n-3). Omega-3 fatty acid desaturase is also absent in mammals, as a result, n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids are not interconvertible in mammals. Polyunsaturated fatty acid n-3 and n-6 are essential fatty acids for mammals, which must be taken along with diet. The consumption of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid increased during the last one and a half century due to the use of vegetable oils of corn, sunflower seeds, cottonseed, and soybeans origin. The vegetable oil from such sources is much enriched with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, but n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are deficient in these sources. Recently, the consumption of n-3 poly unsaturated fatty acids is much lower due to less consumption of fish meat; and consumption of meat and egg produced from commercial feed enriched with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which is deprived of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (Simopoulos 2006). Previously, many potential useful effects of Omega-3 have been discovered and studied in many populations, large animals, primates, and swine. The major beneficial effects include antiatherosclerotic, reduction in the risk of cardiovascular diseases by reducing the triacylglycerol, cholesterol, and VLDL concentration; reduction in many inflammatory markers such as CRP, IL-6, E-selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM, 1IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1; reduction in platelet accumulation and thrombosis, downregulation of PDGF and triggered mononuclear cells; preventing ventricular arrhythmias (Prather et al. 2008).",

The product of this gene can convert n-6 into n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Some later investigations revealed resistance in these transgenic mice to certain diseases such as colitis, chemically induced hepatitis, prostate cancer, and melanoma (Prather et al. 2008). Human fat 1 gene was introduced into pig with somatic cell nuclear transformation, in a result, threefold increase the level of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids along with 25 % decrease in n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids by the efficient conversion of n-6 into n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (Lai et al. 2006; Li et al. 2006). This conversion reduced the n-6/n3 up to five folds in these transgenic pigs compared to control or wild pigs. The reduction of this ration of n-6/n-3 was observed in almost all tissues of transgenic pig in contrast to control animal (Lai et al. 2006; Li et al. 2006). Transgenic pigs were developed with plant gene insert (fatty acid desaturation 2 gene) for 12 fatty acid desaturase from spinach. In transgenic animal linoleic acid (18: 2n-6) in adipocytes was ten times more and white adipose tissue contained 20 % more linoleic acid than wild-type pig (Saeki et al. 2004). Previous findings such as expression of fatty acid desaturase gene insertion in mammals made this possible to alter the fatty acid compositions in domestic animals with modern recombinant biotechnology for production of more useful fats of animal origin for human consumption (Montaldo 2006). Bucher et al. (2002) suggested in 11 randomized meta analysis that the intake of omega-3 reduced mortality due to myocardial infarction and death due to chronic heart disease. The people consumption of omega-3 is 8\u201310 % of the recommended daily intake, while of omega-6 is 1000\u20132000 %. This imbalance can be improved with increased intake of omega-3 enrich diet such as fishes, salmons, eel, herring, sardines, omega-3 rich eggs of hens with modified diet. The omega-3 containing transgenic approaches are under consideration of many commercial companies (Lewis et al. 2000; Pulina et al. 2006). Scheeder et al. (2001) produced cow feed rich with omega-3 without any unpleasant effect on meat texture. Furthermore, omega-3 fatty acids gene can be introduced from fish or other sources to livestock to make transgenic animals rich in omega-3. Transgenic animals with omega-3 transgene or the transgene to convert omega-6 to omega-3 would produce valuable diets to balance the omega-6 in daily intake (Wheeler 2012).",

This catalysis provides nonesterified triglycerides and 2-monoacyl glycerol for tissue consumption.

However, transgenic animals reduce fat content on body but no serious effect was observed on the growth rate of the animals. Additionally, transgenic animals developed pathological conditions such as severe reduction in reproduction (Murray et al. 1999). In two other studies, transgenic pigs were produced with IGF-I and GRF, which expressed and incremented the IGF-I and growth hormone level. Transgenic pigs developed increased diameter of muscles and reduced fat contents without any serious undesirable or pathological effects (Neimann 1998). Some other genes were also attempted in the development of transgenic pig to change the meat or muscle growth along with metallothionein promoter to control their expressions. A chicken oncogene \u201cc-ski\u201d was introduced into transgenic sheep, mice, pigs, and cattle. This gene is primarily involved in hypertrophy of several muscles, while decreasing the fat deposition on the body. This approach has resulted in partial success although muscular hypertrophy has been obtained in a few pigs and cattle (Palmiter et al. 1982; Cameron et al. 1994; Murray et al. 1999; Wheeler 2012).",

Myostatin knockout mice has been developed with increased lean muscles mass, which enlarged the hip and shoulder of transgenic mice. Moreover, transgenic mice achieved incremental skeletal muscles mass all over the body without any gross abnormality. The homozygous animals of such knockout animals have achieved 2\u20133 times more muscle weight and 30 % more body weight compared to normal animals. This increase in the muscular growth was due to hyperplasia of muscles (Mcpherron et al. 1997). The myostatin knockout animals have some adverse effects on reproduction on transgenic animals such as dystocia. The animal welfare concern forced the researchers to overcome this health issue with postnatal inhibition of myostatin gene in transgenic animal (Grobet et al. 2003).",

The transgenic mouse with overexpression of prodomain segment presented 17\u201330 % more body weight and 22\u201344 % total carcass weight compared to wild or control animal. The pMEX-NMCS2 vector with a rat myosin light chain 1 (MLC1) promoter, an SV40 polyadenylation sequence, and an MLC enhancer were used for overexpression of prodomain segment into transgenic animal. In addition, the transgenic animals were not presented any defective phenotype, reproductive, and other undesirable health effects (Yang et al. 2001). The RNAi is a more suitable tool for inhibition of myostatin pathway. The site-specific RNAi molecule could provide more flexible, controlled, and site directed inhibition of this gene expression (Yang et al. 2001). Pirottin et al. (2005) has developed transgenic mice with site-specific Y-chromosome associated expression of such competitive inhibitor molecules, which successfully produced 5\u201320 % more carcass weight or skeleton muscles in male animals. The females were lacking transgene, transgene expression, and also growth characteristics due to absence of Y-chromosome. The inducible or postnatal expression combine approach would be more suitable to make transgenic bull for meat and elite dairy cow simultaneously. Moreover, the sex-sorting technology would enhance the application of this approach, because only bull contain such transgene and expression (Wall et al. 2009).",

The release of transgenic animal in wild condition could be a good option, but a reliable technique for 100 % sterilization of transgenic fish has not yet been established (Jube and Borthakur 2006). However, the transgenic technology solicited to develop large size fish with more than 11 times as control. In addition, transgenic fish has no major side effects and health problems. These \u201csuper fish\u201d are more resistant to disease, more adaptable to cold water, more sustainable in the wild condition compared to nontransgenic fish (Devlin et al. 1994; Du et al. 1992).",

            "text": "The additional characteristics along with growth rate can also be achieved such as antifreeze protein expression into plasma of transgenic fish. The ocean pout (Macrozoarces americanus) and winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus) has been previously developed with such proteins and successfully tolerated the freezing temperature of Atlantic Ocean (Davies and Hew 1990). The antifreezing proteins are characterized into two major types such as antifreeze proteins (AFPs) and antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGs). Antifreezing proteins and antifreezing glycoprotein could lower the freezing temperature of fish serum by attaching to ice surface, to avoid crystal formation. Four type of AFPs (AFP I, AFPII, AFP III, AFP IV) has been discovered, while only one type of AFGs has been identified (Davies and Hew 1990; Jube and Borthakur 2006). The species of fish with aquaculture importance, such as tilapia and Atlantic salmon, do not survive in the freezing temperature especially in Northern Atlantic coast regions. Therefore, the cage forming of such species are not possible in these regions of subzero temperature. The production and use of transgenic fish, especially salmon with antifreezing protein transgenes would expand the fish farming in the regions of subzero temperature along with reduction farming cost and price for consumers (Jube and Borthakur 2006). The flounder AFPs belongs to AFPs type I with two isoforms such as skin type and liver type. Skin type AFPs intracellular protein produced into several peripheral tissues in the form of mature protein, while liver AFPs produce in liver in immature form and need further modification before release (Hew et al. 1986; Jube and Borthakur 2006). Hew et al. (1999) reported transgenic salmons (Salmo salar) to introduce piscine antifreeze protein transgene, which produced liver-specific winter seasonal antifreeze protein. Initially, a single copy of liver type AFPs was injected into fertilized salmon egg, and a stable expression of antifreezing protein was achieved. The consistent expression was observed up to three generation with low concentration of antifreeze protein (250 \u03bcg/ml), which was normally present up to 10\u201320 mg/ml in winter flounders. This expression was insufficient to harbor the freezing temperature in transgenic salmon. Later, the high concentration was achieved with increase in transgenes copy number. This modification made capable to transgenic salmon in successfully harboring the winter freezing temperature. Similar study was performed on goldfish (Carassius auratus), and transgenic goldfish was successfully harboring the freezing water due to inference of piscine antifreeze protein transgene expression (Wang et al. 1995). Previously, the transgenic tilapia fish (Oreochromis niloticus) have been established with several salmonids genes constructs, but better results achieved with the Chinook salmon GH gene under the control expression of ocean pout antifreeze promoter (Rahman et al. 1998). The insertions of transgenes were achieved with fertilized egg cytoplasmic microinjection technique. The researchers achieved a successful genomic integration of transgene into founder (G0) tilapia, as well as in subsequent generations G1 and G2 of transgenic tilapia. Chinook salmon GH transgene expression into transgenic fish presented three times more growth rate compared to wild tilapia and 33 % more feed conversion ratio (Rahman et al. 1998). The farmer would be benefited with more body weight and lower feed consumption. In addition, the expression of this gene would also cause reproductive infertility, which is high desirable trait for the environmental release of transgenic fish (Rahman et al. 1998).",

It belongs to solute carrier protein family 2, which is involved in glucose transport across the cell plasma membrane (Mueckler et al. 1985). The constant glucose supply from blood plasma is required to erythrocyte for energy yielding. The human glucose transporter 1 protein increases the glucose supply to erythrocytes with facilitated diffusion, which is almost 50,000 times higher than translated transmembrane diffusion (Nelson and Cox 2008; Montel-hangen et al. 2008). The expression of human transporter 1 would increase with decrease in glucose level in blood and decrease with increase glucose supply. This transporter protein is very important for the uptake of basal glucose at very low level of glucose for sustainable respiration in all cells (Montel-hangen et al. 2008). In addition, this transported protein is also responsible for the vitamin C transport along with glucose supply in nonvitamin C producing mammals (Montel-hangen et al. 2008).",

The most commonly glucose is converted into glucose-6-phasphate, and the genes encoded hexokinase are found in different species domains such as bacteria, plants, animals, and human. Hexokinase II and glucose transporter protein 4 are most significant protein isoforms involved in the glucose phosphorylation and transport in glucose sensitive tissues such as heart, skeleton muscles, and adipose tissues (Burcelin et al. 1993). Hexokinase I and II can be associated with mitochondria outside of exterior membrane with specific binding of porin or voltage dependent anion channel. Mitochondrial attachments make this possible to gain ATP directly after synthesis, which is one of the two substrates for hexokinase. The tumor cell have almost 200 times higher or elevated level of hexokinases, compared to normal cells (Bustamante and Pedersen 1977). Krasnov et al. (1999a, b) has been reported the transgenic fishes with transgenes human glucose transporter 1 (GLUT 1) and rat hexokinase II. The successful expression of both transgenes improved glucose consumption in transgenic fish, which indirectly solicited in growth and performance of transgenic fish compared to control or wild animals. Similarly, many other enzymes genes from the glucose metabolism and other pathways may be future strategies to improve productivity of farm animals.",

Milk composition modifications in transgenic animals have different applications. Modified milk composition can make more suitable milk for infants to drink. In composition human milk is deficient with \u03b2-lactoglobulin, which has higher relationship of serum protein to caseins. Human milk has more lactoferrin and lysozyme compared to bovine milk. These are involved in transportation of iron and inhibition of bacterial growth in milk (Van-Berkel et al. 2002). Previously, transgenic cow was successfully developed with human lactoferrin gene and bovine milk with lactoferrin expression for human consumption (Reference). In addition, human lipase can also be expressed in the milk of the transgenic animals. Milk with human lipase is capable to digest the lipid content of milk more efficiently, especially in neonates. Lipase can stimulate the bile salt to increase the conversion of milk triglycerides into fatty acid and glycerol (Houdebine 1995).",

The reduction of lactose in the milk is also among the major desirable characters related to the consumption of bovine milk in people with lactose intolerance. According to an estimate, 70 % of people worldwide are suffering with lactose intolerance due to deficient level of lactase in their intestine. The lactose can be reduced into milk by expressing \u03b2-glactosidase into bovine milk or with removal of \u03b1-lactalbumin components from milk with modern biotechnological techniques (Montaldo 2006). Stinnakre et al. (1994) were reported \u03b1-lactalbumine gene inactivation from mouse.

In cow milk, four types of casein proteins such as \u03b1S1- and \u03b2-casein (10 g/l each), \u03b1S2-casein (3.7 g/l), and \u03ba-casein (3.5 g/l). The sequestering and binding of calcium and magnesium with in a spherical particle (micelle) is one of the major functions of the caseins. The outer surface of micelle is made up of \u03ba-casein, which can easily destabilize by chymosin enzyme to the form the curd and finally cheese from milk. The modification in chymosin cleavage sites of aS1-CN to peptide linkages for more efficient hydrolysis can also reduce curd formation time of cheese. Moreover, casein has little sulfur containing amino acids; the alteration in milk by increasing Met contents can improve the nutritional value of such milk. So, any alteration in casein in milk can directly affect the cheese yield from milk (Bawden 1994; Karatzas 2003). Therefore, modification in casein gene is also very helpful to alter and increase nutritive value, cheese yield from milk and other components of milk processing (Table 4.2). Previously, efforts were made to increase the copies of the \u03ba-casein gene into transgenic animals to decrease the size of micelles and to make more susceptible modified \u03ba-casein (References). These studies successfully demonstrated that extra copies of casein gene in mouse model successfully encoding two type of casein: bovine \u03b2-casein and \u03ba-casein. Modified milk collected from cloned transgenic animals with extra copies of casein genes were enriched with \u03b2- and \u03ba-casein, which increased the 30 % total milk casein and 13 % milk protein (Guti\u00e9rrez-Adan et al. 1996; Brophy et al. 2003) with such alterations change the physical properties of protein (Brophy et al. 2003). In another study, the transgenic cow was developed with modification in \u03ba-casein and an overexpression of this gene decrease the size of micelles in milk, which favor the cheese industry; while this milk was slightly more yellow in color and lower \u03b2-casein contents. Economic value of this milk still needs to be proven (Soler et al. 2006).",

The transgenic merino sheep was produced with improve construct, resulted in 12 % improvement in fleece production. In Poll Dorset cross-breed sheep, opposite results were observed such as reduction in wool contents in transgenic sheep contain ovine GH gene construct. The results explained a significant association of breed type with transgene expression and response (Adam et al. 2002; Wall et al. 2009). The wool produce from transgenic animal with ovine GH transgene expression were poor in quality such as larger but less desirable diameter of fibers. The ovine intermediate filament keratin transgene in wool follicle has also been expressed to improve the quality less desirable fibers (Adam et al. 2002; Wall et al. 2009). In sheep, harvesting at specific time is another problem for the farmers and labor intensive. The modern methods of transgenic technologies made this possible that sheep shed their wool fiber at specific time period (Hollis et al. 1983). The mouse epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been introduced in transgenic sheep under the influence of inducible promoter (Hollis et al. 1983). The infusion of Mouse epidermal growth factor (mEGF) induced follicular regression and fleece harvesting more rapid than previous depilatory agents without any anomaly, apart from sustained epidermal thickening. A spot in the wool fibers can be produced with successful expression of such a transgene and endorsed fleece to remove with hand pressure. This modification reduced the cost of metal shearers or clippers during wool harvesting. This cost effectiveness is really an advantageous for wool producers or farmers (Hollis et al. 1983; Wheeler 2012). This modification can also be applied to other wool producers such as camels, mohair goat, alpacas, and other wool producers (Wheeler 2012).",

The MxcDNA transformation and expression in 3T3 cell lines produce resistance against the lethal influenza virus infection (Staeheli et al. 1986). The transgenic piglets have been developed with cDNA construct encoding Murine Mx1 protein. The transgenic piglets were successfully developed resistance against lethal influenza virus infection (Muller et al. 1992). The transgenic piglet with over expression of Mx1 protein might have much detrimental effect on the piglets. Furthermore, the expression of Mx1 protein was eliminated with rearrangement of transgene insert in transgenic piglets (Muller et al. 1992). Mastitis is udder inflammatory disease of cattle \u2018as a result\u2019 animal loss productivity and milk yield.

Moreover, the transgenic pig was developed with transgenic extemporaneous expression of whey acidic protein. The mammary glands development was impaired in transgenic pig (Shammay et al. 1992). These studies are remarkable related to protein function, development and morphogenesis along with species-specific response. Wall et al. (1996) demonstrated that the transgenic sheep expressed the mouse whey acidic protein in all tissue except into lactating mammary glands. Some of the harmful effects are mentioned in Table 4.3.\n",

Poverty, malnutrition, disease, poor hygiene, and unemployment is widespread in the developing world and biotechnologies can play a vital role in this context. Some modified animal food products are developed with modern biotechnological tools. Such animal food items are economical and more useful in respect to health. The modern biotechnology implementation to alter animal products for fat and other characteristics is constrained by a number of factors. One of the major constraints on applying biotechnologies is the economic and wealth status of animal farmers. The major constrains to adopt modified food products with new technology in developing nations include the absence of an accurate database on livestock, biodiversity with animals, disease resistance, and nutrient utilization characteristics.",

These modifications need improvement in the desirable traits quantity, identification of markers linked to certain genes with specific characters or traits, selection of better animals, propagation of superior animals, practical and economically viable methods. The four things to be considered for animals in the transgenic approach for desirable traits are time period for commercial development, regulatory concerns and related issues, economic feasibility, and adoptability of these production methods (Prieto et al. 1999).
