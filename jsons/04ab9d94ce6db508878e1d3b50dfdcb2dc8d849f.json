Remarkable advances have been made in cancer therapy and the 5-year survival has increased for most patients affected by malignancy. There are growing numbers of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) and up to 20% of all patients admitted to an ICU carry a diagnosis of malignancy. Respiratory failure remains the most common reason for ICU admission and remains the leading causes of death in oncology patients. There are many causes of respiratory failure in this population. Pneumonia is the most common cause of respiratory failure, yet there are many causes of respiratory insufficiency unique to the cancer patient. These causes are often a result of immunosuppression, chemotherapy, radiation treatment, or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). Treatment is focused on supportive care and specific therapy for the underlying cause of respiratory failure. Noninvasive modalities of respiratory support are available; however, careful patient selection is paramount as indiscriminate use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is associated with a higher mortality if mechanical ventilation is later required. Historically, respiratory failure in the cancer patient had a grim prognosis. Outcomes have improved over the past 20 years. Survivors are often left with significant disability.",

The importance of expeditious diagnostic precision is reviewed in the context of the outcomes of respiratory failure. The increased use of high resolution computer tomography (HRCT) has greatly aided in narrowing the differential diagnosis of respiratory failure in oncology patients which leads to more efficient use of invasive diagnostic modalities. We will review some classic patterns on HRCT that suggest specific diagnoses with a high sensitivity and specificity. In terms of management, we review the literature on the utility and risks of invasive mechanical ventilation in immunocompromised cancer patients and further discuss the impact of current noninvasive ventilation strategies in this population. Finally, we will offer a general approach to diagnosis and management of respiratory failure in patients with active malignancy.",

These entities include: acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP), acute eosinophilic pneumonia, organizing pneumonia, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Confusion is commonplace as malignancy, chemotherapy regimens, and bone marrow transplantation may predispose to either ARDS or respiratory failure from an ARDS mimic [4, 128, 163] . In practice, one often cannot distinguish between them without aid of bronchoscopy or surgical lung biopsy.

The use of RT has increased, in part as it is tolerated well, generally with few side effects. The lung is radiosensitive and toxicity may occur as collateral damage with an incidence of up to 28%. The incidence is less frequent when radiation is used for treatment of breast cancer [115] . Clinically, the lung has two distinct pathologic responses to ionizing radiation. Radiation pneumonitis is an acute or subacute reaction which occurs within 6 months of thoracic radiotherapy. Risk for acute radiation pneumonitis depends on concomitant use of certain chemotherapy agents, prior radiation, total dose and field size, as well as host factors such as prior chronic lung disease [52] . Dyspnea, cough, and fever develop prior to radiographic changes. Pulmonary function tests demonstrate restrictive ventilatory defect. Reduction in the diffusion capacity (DLCO) is the most sensitive maker of acute and subacute radiation injury [126] . Depending on the degree of lung tissue damaged, the course may be self-limited or progress to severe acute lung injury and fulminant hypoxic respiratory failure [82] . CT correlation can be used to assess the severity of disease. Oxygen and concomitant chemotherapy may worsen the lung injury [168] . The areas of RP tend to develop fibrosis over time [49] .

The presentation is often subacute or chronic and insidious as opposed to acute. It is estimated that up to 20% of patients treated with cytotoxic drugs may develop respiratory symptoms [158] . Numerous drugs are associated with various forms of pulmonary toxicity and the diagnosis should be considered in any cancer patient with new respiratory failure and pulmonary opacities on chest imaging. Drug-induced damage may be dose dependent or idiosyncratic [131] . Databases such as Pneumotox (https://www. pneumotox.com/drug/index/) have been established detailing the many histopathologic and radiologic findings associated with numerous agents. These resources are invaluable in formulating a differential diagnosis and it is often useful to correlate a specific radiographic pattern to a drug in question. In terms of pathophysiological mechanism, bleomycin toxicity is well understood and serves as an archetype for our understanding of drug-induced pulmonary toxicity. Bleomycin damages capillary endothelium and type I pneumocytes leading to free radical damage and exaggerated inflammatory response. Given the release of free radicals, oxygen therapy may worsen the lung injury. This is an unfortunate paradox as the very supportive care used in hypoxemia may be detrimental [46, 168, 171] . The clinical and/or radiographic pattern is variable and not specific to any drug. Common features include: organizing pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, cardiac and noncardiac pulmonary edema, bronchoconstriction, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, radiation recall, and more [92, 148, 150] .

Clinically its manifestations are nonspecific and often overlap with infectious pneumonia. When no precipitating cause can be identified, it is referred to as cryptogenic organizing pneumonia [56] . Characteristic radiographic findings are included in Table 2 . There are many inciting causes including infection, autoimmune disease, vasculitis, immune deficiencies, and transplantation [43] . It has been reported after engraftment of in bone marrow recipients and is associated with acute and chronic graft versus host disease [4] . It may also occur in the context of lung cancer or hematologic malignancy including acute and chronic leukemias, myelodysplastic syndrome, t-cell leukemia, Evans syndrome, and Hodgkin disease [167] . It may also occur as a response to acute drug toxicity or even following radiation therapy [121, 170] . Diagnosis established definitively by lung or transbronchial biopsy but may be suggested on bronchoalveolar lavage. It is a particularly satisfying diagnosis to make as it demonstrates remarkable response to corticosteroid treatment. Relapses, however, are common following withdrawal of steroids [104] .",

Risk also increases with advanced stage of cancer and tumor type. Of the solid tumors, brain, pancreatic, and stomach cancers are most associated with thromboembolic disease. Of the hematologic malignancies, AML is the most frequent culprit of thrombosis [186] . Most pulmonary emboli originate in the proximal veins of the lower extremities. Pulmonary embolism may be classified as acute or chronic, by size, or by hemodynamic characteristics [95, 96] . Low molecular weight heparin is the agent of choice for treatment [96, 105] . In cases of massive pulmonary embolism with hemodynamic compromise, the American College of Chest Physicians suggests use of thrombolytics or catheter directed thrombolysis (Grade 2B and 2C recommendations) [96] . Use of thrombolytics is contraindicated in the stable patient [96] , though there is much debate if hemodynamically stable patients with high risk of deterioration (submassive PE) benefit from clot lysis [119] . Often patients with malignancy have contraindications to anticoagulation. These patients may benefit from placement of a filter within the inferior vena cava. However, recent evidence notes that in patients that can receive anticoagulation, the concomitant use of such filters may not prevent recurrence of pulmonary embolism [120] .",

Some studies quote a higher diagnostic yield of nearly 90% in the bone marrow transplant population [165] . More recent data suggest that bronchoscopy changes the course of management in only 18% of cases [15] . The procedure is not without risk although the complication rates of bronchoscopy are generally low and occur in less than 1% of patients. However, in the hypoxemic cancer patient, the risk of complications increases tenfold. Open lung biopsy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery may provide a specific diagnosis more frequently than bronchoscopy. Yet the complication rates may be even higher with a surgical approach. Often the critically ill cancer patient is of poor protoplasm for undergoing surgery with general anesthesia [168] . In essence, the moderate diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy (or surgery) must be weighed against the risk of complications. The primary concern is worsening hypoxemia to the degree requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. This complication is a near death sentence as mechanical ventilation in those with hematologic malignancy portends a mortality rate ranging from 44% to 100% [14] . Those with solid malignancy have improved outcomes undergoing mechanical ventilation compared to patients with hematologic disease. Given this risk, multiple simultaneous noninvasive modalities (echocardiography, computed tomography, etc.) should be considered prior to bronchoscopy. Noninvasive testing without bronchoscopy is noninferior to FO-BAL in identifying a cause of ARF in patients with cancer and may in fact identify the cause of ARF more quickly than FO-BAL [15] .",

In addition, those treated with NIV less often required escalation to mechanical ventilation [8] .

The population in this study was overwhelmingly comprised of patients with hematologic cancers. This study noted a 93% case mortality rate in those patients treated with oxygen alone. Over the subsequent decade, survival of cancer patients in the ICU improved, even among those undergoing mechanical ventilation. Along with this trend, fewer studies demonstrated benefit of NIV in hematology patients. Often the etiology of respiratory failure was not taken into account, nor was time on onset of ARF to trial of noninvasive ventilation controlled.

Eighty-six patients with homogenous baseline characteristics were enrolled and randomized to oxygen therapy only versus treatment with NIV. This population of patients was studied within the wards rather than intensive care unit. There was no mortality difference between the two groups, nor was there a difference in escalation to ICU level care or implementation of invasive mechanical ventilation [184] . Studies in patients without cancer presenting with hypoxic respiratory failure due to community acquired pneumonia and without associated organ dysfunction have shown benefit with the use of NIV [36, 72, 97] . This is not borne out in the cancer patient. In fact, data indicate that cancer patients with documented respiratory infection may do worse when subjected to NIV as first line therapy for hypoxemia [71] .",

Hypoxic respiratory failure de novo is often prolonged and not immediately reversible. In contrast to hypercapnic respiratory failure or type I respiratory failure from cardiogenic pulmonary edema, NIV without substantial inspiratory support does not reduce the work of breathing in most cases of hypoxia [103] . The inspiratory demand is increased in settings of hypoxia. This flow demand imparts more diaphragmatic inspiratory effort, ergo vast reductions in intrapleural pressure. Combining large negative pleural pressure with increased inspiratory pressures produces enormous swings in transpulmonary pressure and tidal volumes which may worsen diffuse lung injury [94] . In addition, many causes of type I respiratory failure are anatomically heterogeneous resulting in over distention of smaller, healthier sections of lung. Respiratory compliance is associated with the volume of this remaining functional lung. Recent data from a post hoc observational analysis of nine randomized trials have associated driving pressure (tidal volume divided by respiratory system compliance) as a surrogate marker of \"adjusted lung size.\" In this study, the relative risk of death increased in a near linear fashion with increasing driving pressures, even when tidal volume is kept within a \"lung protective\" window of 6 ml/kg ideal body weight [7] . Higher driving pressures in NIV are associated with patient intolerance, leak around the mask, as well as gastric over distention with possible aspiration [103] .",

Benefits in patients with cancer have been demonstrated in the palliative arena [67, 83, 106] . Yet the place of this modality of support is not firmly established. A randomized controlled trial reported survival benefit in type I respiratory failure when HFNC was used in lieu NIV or standard oxygen therapy [74] . This was not borne out in a 2017 study specifically examining the use of HFNC in patients with hematologic malignancy and solid cancers. In this group, HFNC reduced the likelihood of intubation but had no significant effect on mortality [17] . Currently the HIGH study is enrolling patients to evaluate the survival benefit of HFNC in immunocompromised patients. This will be the largest multicenter, randomized controlled trial to date evaluating HFNC in cancer patients. The study completion date is estimated December 2018 [18] .",

Aside from physiologic challenges of respiratory failure, anatomic difficulties are frequent in the cancer population. This is exemplified in the case of a patient with head and neck squamous cell cancer and acute upper airway obstruction. Such anatomical distortion needs to be considered to minimize potential complications and avoid a situation in which one cannot oxygenate nor ventilate. The rate of complications of airway management differs by clinical setting. Failed intubation happens rarely (1 in 2000) in elective surgical cases in the controlled arena of the operating theatre. This number is far more frequent in the emergency department and ICU setting and failed intubation may occur in one of every 50 ICU patients [53] . In every patient requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation predictors of difficulty anatomy and physiology should be sought prior to initiating rapid sequence intubation (RSI). Indeed, RSI may be detrimental to securing the airway in selected patients with severe hypoxemia, right heart failure, hemodynamic instability, or profound obesity [123] . For initial evaluation of the difficult anatomic airway, the mnemonic LEMON is often used. This approach has the clinician evaluate for anatomical difficulties by Looking externally for unusual anatomy, body habitus, scars, etc., Evaluating incisor distance, the length from hyoid to mentum, and the thyroid to mouth, and assessing jaw mobility and mouth opening. Next the Mallampati score is determined on the classic I-IV scale. Class III and above predict a difficult intubation. Obstruction sought out next, especially in the patient with head and neck cancer. Finally, impairment in Neck mobility also presents an anatomic challenge to successful first pass endotracheal intubation. Neck mobility in cancer patients may occur due to prior surgery or as sequela of radiation therapy. If the difficulty anatomic airway is predicted and time allots, it is prudent to seek airway expertise or consider an awake, fiber optic intubation.",

Three physiologically difficult characteristics have been described including hypoxemia, hypotension, and right heart failure. Hypoxemic patients are at risk for rapid desaturation during intubation. Tissue hypoxia implies impaired oxygen delivery or grossly exaggerated oxygen consumption, often both. In a patient with central obesity, the oxygen reserve or functional residual capacity (FRC) is reduced, and when this patient is struck with hypoxia, the time to desaturation during RSI is rapid. It is suggested that if time permits, every patient undergo a period of preoxygenation prior to intubation [172] , preferably with NIV [21] . Note that the indication for NIV in this instance is for preparation for mechanical ventilation. NIV has been shown to improve preoxygenation and end-tidal oxygen far better than standard oxygen alone [21, 164] . Once apneic, implementation of \"diffusion respiration\" or apneic oxygenation provides a buffer against hypoxia by providing a steady flow of oxygen though the upper airway which passively diffuses to the alveoli as oxygen is taken up into the blood stream [173] . HFNC is purportedly an ideal method of diffusion respiration [183] . While prolonged NIV and HFNC may not be appropriate therapy for hypoxemia, their place may be upheld in preparation for securing the airway for mechanical ventilation.",

This combination especially frequent and challenging in the cancer patient as hypotension is common. Side effects of chemotherapy predispose to volume loss by vomiting and dehydration [29] . Sequestration of intravascular fluid into the interstitium occurs later in disease as proteincalorie malnutrition becomes common. Sepsis, cytokine storm from novel therapy, pulmonary embolism, blood loss, and more may contribute to a state of poor perfusion which in turn imparts increased oxygen extraction and subsequent hypoxemia. Hypoxemia may contribute to tissue hypoxia and subsequent metabolic acidosis. This acidic milieu can impair the effect of native catecholamines and thereby worsen hypotension [30] . The negative intrathoracic pressure of spontaneous respiration acts to pull blood from the venous reservoir and increase venous return. Transition to positive pressure increases intrathoracic pressure and reduces this venous return. As such, a patient teetering on the brink may be subject to further hypotension as a result of commonly used induction agents or the implementation of positive pressure ventilation [75, 76] . As many as 30% of critically ill patients experience cardiovascular collapse following intubation [135] . This in turn contributes to longer runs of mechanical ventilation and increased ICU stay which can be detrimental to the immunocompromised cancer patient [75, 76, 86, 124] . Assessment of volume status and appropriate resuscitation and consideration of vasopressor infusion may be appropriate in the peri-intubation phase of the critically ill cancer patient requiring endotracheal intubation [123] .",

Such physiology may develop as a result of pulmonary emboli, pulmonary hypertension, or cor pulmonale from any cause of hypoxemia in the cancer patient. Much like the pulmonary circulation, the right ventricle is a low-pressure, high-compliance pump. However, it has limited ability to adapt to acute insult. Hypotension due to right heart failure needs careful evaluation prior to initiation of positive pressure ventilation as increased intrathoracic pressure also increases right ventricular afterload. Hypoxia from ARF induces pulmonary vascular vasoconstriction which places further strain on an ailing RV. Measures normally thought of to restore perfusion pressures such as volume resuscitation or vasoactive agents may further impede RV function and perpetuate poor LV filling and hypotension. If RV dysfunction is suspected prior to intubation, bedside echocardiography should be performed to evaluate for signs of RV failure. In this situation, avoidance of hypoxemia with preoxygenation and apneic oxygenation are a must, and consider \"blood pressure neutral\" drugs for induction. Initial ventilator settings should target a lower mean airway pressure (if possible) until further stabilization. If available prior to intubation, one may consider application of inhaled nitric oxide or inhaled epoprostenol to improve V/Q mismatch and augment RV unloading and LV filling [123] .",

A \"lung-protective\" strategy should be implemented with tidal volumes of 4-8 ml/kg ideal body weight, as well as selecting a modest level of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and making best efforts to limit plateau pressures (in a volume targeted mode of ventilation) to less than 30 cmH 2 0 [1] . Such remains the current standard of care despite studies over the last decade challenging this dogma. Once severe hypoxemia occurs, emphasis should be on providing adequate oxygenation while attempting to reduce or eliminate ventilator-induced lung injury. Whether pressure or volume targeted therapy is used, selection of appropriate PEEP may be especially important in the patient with suspected chemotherapy or radiation-induced lung injury as it may obviate the need for injurious levels of inspired oxygen [37, 80, 117] . While the three major studies in this area (ALVEOLI, LOV and EXPRESS) reported no survival benefit, they did demonstrate improvements in PaO 2 /FiO 2 . Many strategies to select PEEP area available, including incremental trial of PEEP, decremental selection of PEEP, and observation of the pressure-time curve during constant flow volume targeted ventilation (stress index) [80] . For simplicity, the ARDS Clinical Trial Network has created a table with suggested degrees of PEEP based on requirements for FiO 2 (Table 5) .",

Twenty years ago mechanical ventilation following bone marrow transplanted was associated with a mere 2-6% chance of survival. In this study from 1992, the authors elaborated that of 348 bone marrow transplant patients requiring mechanical ventilation, none survived if they required mechanical ventilation for more than 9 days [59] . Further studies in the early 1990s demonstrated high mortality rates of cancer patients in medical intensive care units [35, 151] . This perpetuated a mentality that admission of such patients to the ICU was futile care. Indeed attitudes toward the care of critically ill oncology patients vary by medical subspecialty [130] . Whereas intensivists may focus on organ failure and retain pessimistic notions of the outcomes of critically ill cancer patients [25] , oncologists emphasize aspects of cancer therapy and tend to overestimate survival of oncologic patients with acute respiratory failure [50] . Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach with frequent communication between ICU teams, oncology, and palliative care is vital to minimize misconceptions and clarify viewpoints of patient care. Such comprehensive multidisciplinary care is associated with improved survival in this population [101] . In the last 25 years, the morality rates of cancer patients admitted to the ICU have improved and approached that of the general population (30-65%) [61, [159] [160] [161] . The notion of cancer as a chronic illness should be upheld when considering admission of the oncology patient to the ICU. Excluding individuals with hematopoietic stem cell transplant, oncology patients requiring mechanical ventilation for ARF have a 40% mortality rate. For perspective, a 2004 study identified a 38% mortality rate for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for exacerbation of COPD [100] . Short term prognosis in critically ill adult oncology now depends on the nature of the acute illness rather than the stage of malignancy or by the complications of cancer therapy [27, 90, 116] .",

Highest rates of mortality is in those patients requiring mechanical ventilation [152] . When diagnosed with the acute respiratory distress syndrome, mortality rates may exceed 60% [16, 145] . Similarly, adult HCT recipients that require endotracheal intubation have mortality rates near 70% [6] . Variation between studies may be attributed to differences in indication for mechanical ventilation. However, several factors have been identified that portend an especially poor prognosis. These include respiratory failure from a poorly reversible cause [159] , underlying chronic pulmonary illness [24] , severe hypoxemia prior to intubation (PaO 2 <50 mmHg) [81] , and prolonged need for mechanical ventilation [69] . In addition, a small study including patients undergoing chemotherapy while intubated in the ICU revealed an 87% mortality rate [61] .",
