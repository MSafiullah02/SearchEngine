This approach has been used in numerous previous studies and has a strong theoretical basis in stochastic individual-based counting processes such as Hawkes process, the Erland Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model, and the Bellman-Harris process. To model the number of infections over time, we need to specify a generation distribution g with density g(\u03c4 ), (the time between when a person gets infected and when they subsequently infect another other people). The generation distribution is unknown, but we can approximate it by assuming it is the same as the serial interval distribution (time from onset to onset). We choose these to be Gamma distributed:",

These daily deaths are modelled using a positive real-valued function d t,m = E[D t,m ] that represents the expected number of deaths attributed to COVID-19. The daily deaths D t,m are assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution with mean d t,m and variance d t,m + dt,m \u03c6 , where \u03c6 follows a positive half normal distribution, i.e.",
