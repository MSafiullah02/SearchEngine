Due to the paucity of randomized studies some recommendations are based on literature review and a consensus of expert opinion.The GRADE nomenclature was used to evaluate levels of evidence and to assess the strength of recommendations. The GRADE criteria are specified in the BCSH guideline pack and the GRADE working group website.

It is suggested that these websites are reviewed directly to ensure that guidance is up to date (https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/seasonal-influenza-guidance-data-and-analysis; last accessed 1 November 2015). The recommendations provided by Health Protection Scotland are based on these recommendations (http://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/resp/seasonalinfluenza.aspx; last accessed 1 November 2015) and Public Health Wales also follows similar recommendations (http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sitesplus/888/page/43745; last accessed 5 July 2015). The current recommendations are 75 mg oseltamivir orally for 10 d once daily if the dominant influenza strain is of lower risk for oseltamivir resistance (e.g. A(H3N2). The recommendations provide lower doses for children <13 years of age. Ideally, therapy should be started within 48 h of exposure on the advice of a specialist. Inhaled Zanamivir (10 mg for 10 d once daily for adults and children \u22655 years of age; it is not licensed for children <5 years) is an alternative if the dominant influenza strain is likely to be resistant to oseltamivir e.g. A(H1N1)pdm2009. Ideally, therapy should be started within 36 h of last contact. The use of zanamivir relies on the ability of the adult or child to effectively use the inhaler. Intravenous or nebulized zanamivir is unlicensed but available for compassionate use on a named patient basis.",

Toxicities associated with the administration of aerosolized ribavirin include bronchospasm, cough, claustrophobia, nausea, rash, reduced pulmonary function, mucus plugging and conjunctival irritation (Shah & Chemaly, 2011). There is a potential risk that ribavirin is teratogenic and mutagenic so patients and staff should be made aware of the risks. These are documented in full in the summary of product characteristics (https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/866; last accessed 05 April 2015).

This retrospective study reviewed the outcome of all patients who had laboratory\u2010confirmed RSV infections from January 1996 to May 2009. Patients were treated with aerosolized ribavirin and/or IVIG at the discretion of the treating physician. The same group has subsequently published an Immunodeficiency Scoring Index based on the data from the 237 patients in the study who presented with URTI symptoms (Shah et al, 2014). Patients were stratified into low, medium and high\u2010risk groups based on a scoring system (see Table 4). Patients who scored 0\u20132 were classified as low\u2010risk, those who scored 3\u20136 were classified as moderate risk and those who scored 7\u201312 were classified as high\u2010risk (Shah et al, 2014). High\u2010risk patients were significantly more at risk of LRTI and mortality than moderate or low\u2010risk patients (P < 0\u00b7001). Patients in the high\u2010risk group also had the greatest benefit from ribavirin administered at the URTI stage. This scoring system has not yet been validated in a prospective cohort of patients.",

Twenty\u2010five patients received treatment with oral ribavirin with IVIG or oral ribavirin plus palivizumab (14 for URTI, 11 for LRTI). Oral ribavirin was administered at a loading dose of 10 mg/kg, which was then increased to 400 mg three times daily on day 2, and 600 mg three times daily on day 3. Four patients required mechanical ventilation and received IV ribavirin using the same dosing regimen. RSV\u2010attributable mortality was 18% (6/34).

Three patients (3/13, 23%) died of RSV\u2010related respiratory infection. All seven patients with URTI progressed to LRTI at the starting dose of 10 mg/kg/d but six subsequently responded at higher doses. The median duration of therapy was 25\u00b75 d (range 10\u201333 d). No patients developed haemolysis. Marcelin et al (2014) also recently reported on the use of oral ribavirin in a heterogeneous patient group of 34 patients including some HSCT recipients. No patients died of RSV infection but one developed haemolytic anaemia and lactic acidosis and another developed altered mental status (Marcelin et al, 2014). Although evidence is limited, oral ribavirin appears to be safe and cost\u2010effective for the treatment of URTI in HSCT recipients.
