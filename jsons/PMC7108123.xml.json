She was previously admitted in April with fungal peritonitis related to her peritoneal dialysis. Despite antifungal and antibiotic therapy, her respiratory function deteriorated. She became increasingly dyspneic and required supplemental oxygen. High-resolution computer tomography of the thorax revealed progressive bilateral consolidation. On day 5 of admission, she began to vomit, and episodes of four-limb twitching were documented. Within a few hours, she became confused and disorientated. Laboratory investigation showed electrolyte and blood pH values within the appropriate reference intervals and a static urea of 20 mmol/L. Seizures recurred despite phenytoin administration and became prolonged, lasting >30 min. Oxygen saturation decreased to 40%, requiring immediate resuscitation and intensive care support. She was ventilated and sedated with propofol, and valporate therapy was commenced.",

In this regard, it is interesting to note that coronaviruses have been implicated in demyelinating brain pathology (4). Arbour et al.(4) documented the presence of the seemingly harmless human respiratory coronavirus OC43 in the brain parenchyma of patients with multiple sclerosis. Murine hepatitis virus, another coronavirus, has been linked to chronic inflammation and demyelination of the central nervous system (5). Therefore, SARS-CoV infection of the brain is a distinct possibility. Our data thus suggest that a severe acute neurologic syndrome might occasionally accompany SARS. Further studies will be needed to demonstrate conclusively that SARS-CoV is indeed causative of neurologic manifestations such as those described here and to address the potential neuropathologic sequelae of SARS-CoV infection of the central nervous system.",
