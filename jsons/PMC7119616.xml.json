            "text": "The Caliciviridae are a family of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses comprising both human and animal pathogens (Clarke and Lambden, 1997). The four genera of the Caliciviridae, i.e. Norovirus, Sapovirus, Lagovirus and Vesivirus, have been classified on the basis of their genome organization and structure (Green et al., 2000). A fifth genus has been suggested following discovery of a bovine enteric calicivirus, which is genetically most similar to sapoviruses and lagoviruses, based on genomic organization of two open reading frames (ORF's) (Chen et al., 2006, Liu et al., 1999, Smiley et al., 2002, Sugieda et al., 1998). Noroviruses and sapoviruses are common causes of acute viral gastroenteritis in humans (Chen et al., 2006, Liu et al., 1999, Smiley et al., 2002, Sugieda et al., 1998), and are also found in swine, cattle, mice and possibly companion animals (cats and dogs) (Guo et al., 1999, Wang et al., 2005). Viruses in the genus Lagovirus infect lagomorphs (rabbits and brown hares) and the viruses in the genus Vesivirus are animal pathogens with a clearly broader host range (Radford et al., 2004).",

Infections with vesiviruses in humans have been reported to cause vesicular exanthema on hands after a laboratory incident, and on the face of a field biologist working with marine mammals. The strain recovered from the laboratory worker was related most closely to San Miguel sea lion virus (SMSV) serotype-5, which has several natural hosts (Chen et al., 2006, Smith et al., 1998a, Smith et al., 1998b). The zoonotic potential of some Vesivirus strains has further been suggested by reports of SMSV antibodies in humans (Chen et al., 2006, Smith et al., 1998a, Smith et al., 1998b). A high prevalence of anti-Vesivirus antibody together with Vesivirus viremia was observed among patients with hepatitis of unknown etiology in the USA (Smith et al., 2006). These findings indicate a potential for Vesivirus infection, and possibly illness, in humans. It was suggested that vesiviruses, with their broad host range, might manifest themselves by causing hepatitis and possibly other diseases in humans.",

None of the products formed were compatible with Vesivirus characteristics, based on melting curve analysis or expected product size of 501 bp by agarose-gel analysis.

Sequencing of these bands did not yield Vesivirus sequences when subjected to BLAST, but sapoviruses (n\n = 1), bacteroides spp. (n\n = 19) and the other products did not yield a sequence. The Sapovirus positive sample had two bands on gel, of which the upper band was approximately 500 bp. This sample was confirmed as Sapovirus using a Sapovirus-specific assay (Svraka et al., 2007). From the samples of patients with unexplained rash illnesses 16 generated a product of 300 bp. When sequenced, these products matched Staphylococcus aureus. One hundred and thirty-six samples (46%) from patients with unexplained respiratory disease generated non-specific products of 300 bp, of these samples 40 were sequenced and all of them matched S. aureus. Three stool culture isolates of unknown etiology from enterovirus surveillance generated a PCR product of 300 bp, when visualized on agarose-gel. The sequences of these products yielded a mammalian orthoreovirus 1.",

SybrGreen was used because development of a generic assay was aimed, which would be able to detect all (or almost all) Vesivirus isolates. It was not possible to design a generic probe, which would be able to detect all vesiviruses. Development of different probes for different strains of Vesivirus genus could be an option for this and will be considered.",

Furthermore, EAV was included in 533 fecal samples to measure the inhibition. These samples were tested for common gastroenteritis viral pathogens, in none of these samples inhibition was measured (Svraka et al., manuscript in preparation. Syndromic detection of acute viral gastroenteritis by use of random primers and internally controlled multiplex real-time PCR assays). Vesiviruses are known as animal pathogens, and infect a broad range of species causing different clinical syndromes. In addition, cross-species infections have been documented for several vesiviruses (Smith et al., 1998a). Recently, Smith and co-workers detected Vesivirus RNA by PCR in 9.8% (11 of 112) of serum samples from a group of blood donors in the USA, suggesting that such infections are widespread. Ten of the RNA positive serum samples originated from blood donors with elevated blood liver alanine aminotransferase levels. Smith et al. (2006) also found a high seroprevalence of anti-Vesivirus antibodies in patients with acute hepatitis of unknown etiology (5 of 26), and the highest seroprevalence was detected in patients with acute hepatitis associated with blood transfusion and dialysis (7 of 15). Furthermore, VESV and SMSV have been described in swine, sea lions, and other animals in the USA (O\u2019Hara et al., 1998, Sawyer, 1976, Smith and Akers, 1976, Smith and Latham, 1978, Smith et al., 1977). This may imply that these vesiviruses are endemic on the Northern American continent. In contrast, no reports on any vesivirus infection in either animals or humans in Europe have ever been published. In view of these findings, it was decided to assess the possibility of vesiviruses as causes of illness in the Netherlands. Therefore, unexplained hepatitis serum samples, stool samples of unexplained etiologies from patients with gastroenteritis, throat-swab specimens of patients with rash illnesses, throat-swab and nose-swabs of patients with acute respiratory diseases, and unexplained cultures from enterovirus surveillance were tested. No evidence of any Vesivirus involvement was found in these samples.",
