In the present study, I first classified the selected articles from Science & Education in different levels (details are presented below), which were later assigned a category, and finally in Chap. 10.1007/10.1007/978-3-319-67726-2_7, categories from different studies (Chaps. 10.1007/10.1007/978-3-319-67726-2_3\u201310.1007/10.1007/978-3-319-67726-2_6) are compared to facilitate conceptual understanding. This procedure can be summarized in the following steps: (a) Comparison of data sources (articles) to assign a level (I\u2013V); (b) comparison of these levels (presented later) which facilitated their classification in categories; and (c) comparison of categories from different studies to facilitate understanding and draw conclusions. Following guidelines were used while developing the different steps of the procedure (based in part on Charmaz, 2005, p. 528):Familiarity with the setting and topic of study in each of the selected articles.Evaluate classification of the selected articles to see if they are based on appropriate evidence.Systematic comparisons between the classifications and the categories.The need for the categories to represent a wide range of experiences represented in the classifications.Establish a logical and conceptual link between the classifications, categories, and arguments for the analyses.\n",

Drawing on the work of Longino (1990, 2002), Jim\u00e9nez-Aleixandre (2012) has explored the relationship between objectivity in science and explanatory plurality:Longino (1990) undertook an analysis of scientific knowledge with the goal of reconciling the objectivity of science with its social and cultural construction. Recently she has explored the epistemological consequences of the recognition of the social character of scientific inquiry in connection to pluralism, or the acknowledgement of explanatory plurality (Longino, 2002). For Longino (2008) knowledge itself is social, because what matters is what the scientific community comes to agree or disagree on \u2026. Viewing scientific knowledge as socially constructed has influenced both the design of science classrooms as communities of learners, and the ways of studying classroom interactions, in particular the discursive ones, as argumentation (p. 469, italics added).

However, it is generally agreed that at the lowest level, the level of species, there is significantly more reality or objectivity. No one, for instance, thinks that it is a matter of choice about whether Michael Ruse or Peter Takacs should be included in the group Homo sapiens, and that Toto the dog and Secretariat the horse should be excluded. The question now becomes that of wherein lies the objectivity or reality of species, as opposed say to genera (p. 23). Classified as Level IV.\n",

The same can be said of students, and their perceptions affect how they learn. Teachers who follow the inquiry approach to teaching, for example, have varying conceptions of what inquiry means. Thus, a theory adopted by different teachers can lead to contrary results.

Similarly, the approximations in Galilean equations are not less objective than the previously non-approximate ones.

For example, the statement that \u201cIsaac Newton was born on 4 January 1643\u201d is considered to be certain and an instance of objective knowledge.

In contrast, these authors suggest a proactive, philosophically pragmatic approach based on the work of John Dewey (1925/1983), according to which knowledge is achieved primarily through a process of inquiry that is characterized by its social, experimental, and fallible nature. Furthermore, inquiry begins for most people not with abstract puzzles but with concrete problematic situations. This approach neither avoids nor ignores controversy and thus goes beyond the narrow epistemological solutions generally presented in school science:In consequence, this means that narrow epistemological solutions will often be insufficient to resolve controversies in science education: it cannot be enough to prove a particular theory is \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cverified.\u201d Consider an example that illustrates this: the proponents of IDC advocate for a \u201cteach the controversy\u201d approach to teaching evolution.

Longino is widely considered to have undermined or dissolved the distinction between the epistemic and the social; (g) Pluralism remains as a step in the development of science and eventually gives way to consensus.

Finally, Carrier (2013) concluded that pluralism does not detract from scientific objectivity but is a means to achieving objectivity: \u201cScientific consensus formation is possible because, regardless of divergent epistemic inclinations and predilections, scientists have a fundamental commitment in common, the commitment, namely, to give heed to certain rules in debating knowledge claims.

Henry Fairfield Osborn, president of the museum based his curatorial work on the purported use of objectivity as a means to communicate the validity of the evolutionary theory. However, this was criticized by the Baptist pastor John Roach Straton by establishing a different type of objectivity based on pluralistic approaches to theories of origin that included both evolutionary theory and creationist account. Consequently, established as a common value, objectivity ceased to discriminate between scientists and non-scientists. Next, Homchick considers that both Daston and Galison (1992) and Gergen (1994) provide useful lenses to look at the Osborn-Straton debate. With respect to the historical origin of objectivity, Homchick (2010, p. 486) noted:Objectivity, often connected with the rise of Baconian science, came to be associated with a particular matrix of values in the nineteenth century. Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison in their article, \u201cThe Image of Objectivity,\u201d discuss the use of objectivity during and after the nineteenth century (Daston & Galison, 1992). They identify atlases as bearers of the concept of objectivity specifically because of the association between the visual and the factual embedded in this type of artifact. Additionally, the authors establish how objectivity is not only powerful through the visual content, but that the use of this concept actually represented an apparent superiority of judgment through a \u201cself-denying moralism.\u201d (Daston & Galison, 1992, p. 99)\n",

At the end of the citation, Matthews provides the well-known quote from Lakatos (1971), to the effect that if philosophy of science without history of science is empty, then history of science without philosophy of science is blind. Rest of the citation constitutes a preamble and even perhaps a guide to future research on the application of history and philosophy of science (HPS) to science education. It refers to the difficulties involved in recounting any historical episode, and hence the problematic nature of objectivity. Interestingly, he draws a parallel between the scientist\u2019s theory and a historian\u2019s theory, as both are theory-laden. It is not farfetched to suggest that in the case of a conflict between the two theories, it is the historian\u2019s responsibility to set the record straight. A good example of this conflict is the role played by Holton (1978a, b) in the oil drop experiment that helped to understand Millikan\u2019s handling of his published data. Matthews (1992) provides another facet of this conflict by referring to the case of Galileo, who was considered by nineteenth-century philosophers and scientists as an inductivist and empiricist. However, this picture changed in the twentieth century and Galileo came to be considered as a Platonist dedicated to rationalism and thought experiments.",

However, in their opinion it is not enough to say that objectivity can be equated with acceptance. Furthermore, in order to support their thesis of how objectivity cannot be equated with acceptance, Rowlands et al. (2011) provide the example of the 4-color theorem. This theorem was proven first by Alfred Kempe in 1879 and later by Peter Tait in 1880. However, 10 years later in 1890 it was found that both \u201cproofs\u201d contained fallacies. This episode led Rowlands et al. (2011) to conclude that consensus for proof (1880\u20131890) did not mean that the theorem was proved and hence objective. Despite the merit of this interpretation one could argue that it was the community that revealed the fallacies in the theorem and hence shows mathematics to be socially accepted knowledge, as suggested by Ernest (1991). This also illustrates Daston and Galison\u2019s (2007) thesis of the evolving nature of objectivity, which is socially conditioned by the scientific community.",

They used an historical account of the \u201chunt\u201d for the causative agent of SARS that was infused with several examples of theory-laden nature of observations. In one of the video clips they showed that immediately following the announcement on March 18, 2002, by a group of scientists from Hong Kong and Germany that the virus causing SARS was paramyxovirus, other research groups around the world quickly announced that they had also found evidence that paramyxovirus was the causative agent of SARS. Interestingly,However, only a few days later, on 22 March 2003, another group of researchers in Hong Kong announced that further evidence showed that coronavirus, rather than paramyxovirus, is the causative agent of SARS. Immediately after this announcement, several laboratories, including Rotterdam, Frankfurt and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, also confirmed the coronavirus theory. This episode illustrates the theory-laden nature of observation and shows how scientists\u2019 expectations or predictions influence what they see and how they interpret the data. Acknowledgement of the biased observation of data is in stark contrast to the usual school science curriculum portrayal of scientists as objective and impartial in interpreting data (Wong et al., 2009, p. 110, as part of a section entitled: \u201cObjectivity of scientists and theory-laden observation\u201d).

When Darwin developed his theory of evolution, he made liberal use of facts that had been gathered by his teleologically oriented predecessors, but he did not respect the valuations which those facts originally carried. In fact, Darwin\u2019s approach turned teleological biology on its head and initiated the destruction of the man-centered and goal-oriented biology then prevalent\u201d (pp. 53\u201354).

This, however, may constitute a dilemma for a science educator who believes that science and the values on which it is based are generally objective. Cordero (1992) resolves the dilemma in the following terms:The way in which science has forged the objectivity of its values is, I suggest, of particular interest to a certain type of person in the contemporary world. I have in mind a person who agrees that science is acceptably objective, and who cannot honestly take as legitimate any absolute truths or values, let alone ones that are imposed by mere authority.

We must develop more nuanced and sophisticated accounts of concepts such as \u201cbias,\u201d \u201cobjectivity,\u201d and \u201cscientific rationality\u201d that reflect the complex interactions between science and values (p. 1078).

Students in particular were prone to change their estimation of science because of what they perceived as an unholy alliance between the community of science and a military-industrial complex that developed and produced such weapons. The rhetoric of values neutrality and objectivity was not tenable when the science community having taken credit for such things as the Green Revolution now denied any responsibility for Agent Orange and Napalm. Science not only lost its luster, it lost its innocence (p. 431). Classified as Level III.\n",
