            "text": "Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are a great threat to public health worldwide. Around 60%\u201380% of human and mammal EIDs originate from wildlife, a typical example being henipavirus\u2010related lethal neurologic and respiratory diseases that originated from bat viruses (He, Zhao, et al., 2019; Li et al., 2018; Su et al., 2016). Nipah virus (NiV) is a deadly paramyxovirus which is naturally harboured by several species of bats belonging to the genus Pteropus. NiV disease first emerged in Southeast Asia in September 1998 and by December 1999, the epidemic had caused 283 human encephalitis cases and 109 deaths in Malaysia and 11 cases with encephalitis or respiratory symptoms and 1 death in Singapore (Chua, 2003; Chua et al., 2000). Since 2001, frequent outbreaks of NiV occurred in India, Bangladesh and the Philippines adding up to 666 human infections, 388 deaths and a mortality rate of around 60% according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and other recent reports (Arunkumar et al., 2018; Ching et al., 2015; Chua, 2003; Sourimant & Plemper, 2016). Of note, in February 2018, NiV infection was listed by the WHO as one of the priority diseases posing a public health risk. In May 2018, a NiV outbreak was reported in Kerala, India, with 23 identified human cases (18 laboratory\u2010confirmed cases) and 21 deaths, being the third NiV outbreak known to occur in India (Arunkumar et al., 2018). Unlike the initial outbreaks in Malaysia and Singapore, human\u2010to\u2010human transmission played an important role in the spread of NiV during the outbreaks in India, Bangladesh and the Philippines (Arankalle et al., 2011; Arunkumar et al., 2018; Chadha et al., 2006; Ching et al., 2015; Gurley et al., 2007; Luby et al., 2009). An epidemiological investigation on Bangladesh human cases of Nipah virus infection during 2001\u20132007 shows that more than half of human infections caused by human\u2010to\u2010human transmission (Luby et al., 2009). In addition to bats of the genus Pteropus, NiV also naturally infects animals more closely related to humans, such as pigs, goats, horses, dogs and cats (AbuBakar et al., 2004; Ching et al., 2015; Chua, 2003; Chua et al., 2000). This wide host range may be due to the two cell receptors for NiV, ephrin\u2010B2 and ephrin\u2010B3, which are highly conserved across many species (Bonaparte et al., 2005; Negrete et al., 2005, 2006; Xu, Broder, & Nikolov, 2012). Due to its high lethality, the lack of effective vaccines or treatments and the re\u2010emergence of deadly zoonotic NiV in South and Southeast Asia that suggested human\u2010to\u2010human transmission, greater outbreaks of NiV might be possible in the future.",

            "text": "Given the ongoing infections of humans, NiV is considered to have pandemic potential. When stablishing in a new host, NiV has to adapt to novel conditions, a process that provides strong selection pressure. Little is known about the NiV genomic changes required for its transmission to humans, in line with the lack of knowledge on common genetic \u2018host jump\u2019 rules from bats to humans or to other mammals. Here, we combined phylogenetic with selection analysis and structural biology to understand the role of different NiV lineages in interspecies transmission and the role of adaptive evolution during transmission from bats to new hosts in relation to structural and functional changes. Moreover, we investigate a possible increase in pathogenicity and the ability for human transmission and the genetic and evolutionary dynamics of NiV from the Bangladesh and Malaysia lineages.",

For G, we used the pdb file 3D12, which contains the structure of the ectodomain of NiV G protein (residues 71\u2013602) bound to the mouse ephrin\u2010B3 (residues 30\u2013170) (Xu et al., 2008) and the pdb file 2VSM which is the structure of G (residues 188\u2013606) bound to the human ephrin\u2010B2 receptor (residues 31\u2013170) (Bowden, Aricescu, et al., 2008). The prefusion structure of the F protein was visualized using the pdb file 5EVM (Xu et al., 2015). Since no post\u2010fusion structure of NiV F is available, we used the structure of F from the related paramyxovirus Newcastle Disease Virus (pdb file 3MAW) (Swanson et al., 2010), which has ~50% amino acid similarity with NiV F. Likewise, since no structure of L from NiV (or from any other paramyxovirus) is available, we used the structure of L from Vesicular Stomatitis virus (pdb file 5A22) (Liang et al., 2015) and identified the positively selected and adaptive sites by sequence alignment. Determination of the distance of a salt bridge was done with the measurement wizard tool of the PyMol software.",

The fixed effects likelihood (FEL), single\u2010likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC), fast unconstrained Bayesian approximation (FUBAR), mixed effects model of evolution (MEME) were the algorithms used to identify sites under selection. Significance level was set with p\u2010value threshold of 0.1 for FEL, SLAC and MEME and with posterior probability of 0.9 for FUBAR. A site detected by more than two algorithms was considered under selection. An adaptive branch\u2010site REL test for episodic diversification (aBSREL) was used to detect positively selected branches (Kosakovsky Pond & Frost, 2005; Murrell et al., 2013; Murrell et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2015). We also split the N, P, G, F, L, M genes into the Bangladesh and the Malaysian lineages and reconstructed the common ancestor amino acid sequence of each lineage independently. The ML method implemented in CODEML of PAML (version 4.8) was used to reconstruct the ancestral amino acid state. Potential adaptive sites were defined as changes which dominated in another (non\u2010bat) host, sequences that were different from other dominant amino acids in pigs and ancestral amino acids. The association of potential adaptive sites and phenotype (host jump) using counts of dominant amino acids in pigs and other host sequences was determined using the chi\u2010square test. The statistical significance was tested using the method described by He et al. (article In press).",

Ephrin\u2010B2 and ephrin\u2010B3 sequences from the Pteropus vampyrus bat (NP_001292125.1 and ABV44497.1) were aligned with the human ephrin\u2010B2 and the mouse ephrin\u2010B3 sequences, respectively.

Further analysis performed by SimPlot 3.5.1 indicated that the event was a false\u2010positive result (data not shown). Since there was no recombination event interfering the construction of phylogenetic trees, all full\u2010genome sequences and sequences of each gene were used to reconstruct ML trees. N gene tree has apparently more complex structure than full\u2010genome tree since more N sequences were used in the analysis. In both ML trees, NiV all could be divided into two main lineages: the Bangladesh and Malaysia lineages, and only NiV from the Bangladesh lineage circulate in India and Bangladesh while in Malaysia only NiV from the Malaysia lineage circulate (Figure 1), as reported previously (Lo et al., 2012; Lo Presti et al., 2016; Rahman et al., 2010). Analysis based on a large number of N coding sequences (Figure 1b) revealed human and bat\u2010derived NiV in Bangladesh lineage and a more complicated structure in the Malaysia lineage including viruses derived from multiple hosts (bat, swine and human), which is corresponding to the different transmission modes of two lineages (Av et al., 2018). Of note, NiV belonging to different lineages was observed in local bat population of Thailand and Cambodia, and this phenomenon in Thailand was previously reported while NiV from Cambodia bats was formerly thought to only belong to Malaysian lineage, which could be the result of the analysis of additional Cambodia bats sequences obtained in 2013 (Lo et al., 2012; Reynes et al., 2005; Wacharapluesadee et al., 2010, 2005, 2016). In addition, NiV could be divided into these two lineages based on ML trees reconstructed based on other coding sequences (Fig [Link], [Link]), which is similar to the results of previous studies (Lo et al., 2012). BaTS analysis revealed that the NiV p\u2010value of AI and PS was less than .05 (Table 1) and apart from the MC p\u2010value of Cambodia which was 1, the p\u2010values of other countries were less than .05.

The head region binds to the cellular receptor ephrin\u2010B2 or ephrin\u2010B3 (Bonaparte et al., 2005; Bowden, Aricescu, et al., 2008; Bowden, Crispin, et al., 2008; Negrete et al., 2005, 2006; Xu et al., 2008). It is currently believed that receptor\u2010binding transduces a signal to the stalk region which then activates the viral F protein leading to conformational changes that result in membrane fusion. In virus particles, G forms a tetrameric spike during intracellular transport and at the cell surface might interact with the F protein (Bose, Jardetzky, & Lamb, 2015). The amino acid locations, which vary between the Bangladesh and the Malaysia lineage of bat\u2010derived viruses and are neither adaptive nor positive selected sites are shown in Table S2 and Figure 3a as magenta sticks within the head domain of G (blue cartoon) bound to ephrin\u2010B3 (green cartoon). Most of them are located at the proposed interaction surface between G monomers and thus might contribute to oligomerization of G (Bowden, Crispin, et al., 2008). N481 is part of the used glycosylation site N481NT (Bowden, Crispin, et al., 2008), which is exchanged to D in all strains from the Bangladesh lineage and in three out of 13 strains from the Malaysia lineage which therefore lack a carbohydrate at this site.",

A loop in the structure of ephrin forms a shallow but extensive protein\u2013protein interaction surface that is buried deeply in a hydrophobic pocket on the G surface. These hydrophobic interactions are assisted by amino acids (shown as red sticks) which form salt bridges or hydrogen bonds with ephrin\u2010B3. Especially interesting in this regard is E501, which forms a salt bridge with R106 in ephrin\u2010B3 and Q388 and Y389 that form hydrogen bonds with D108 (Xu et al., 2008).

Alignment of the other mammalian and bat ephrin\u2010B3 sequences revealed two amino acid changes: S75 changes to N in bat and E85 is replaced by G in bat (labelled as red sticks in Figure 3b). Although these are non\u2010conservative changes, they are too far away from the part of ephrin\u2010B3 contacting G and thus are unlikely to affect virus binding. In ephrin\u2010B2, three conservative amino acid differences became apparent: T93 is replaced by S, I111 by V and K106 by R in the bat receptor (labelled as red sticks in Figure 3c, except K106 which is a purple stick). Especially, interesting is residue 106, which forms a salt bridge with E510 in G. This salt bridge is also present in the structure of G bound to ephrin\u2010B3, but here a K instead of an R is present. Both of these basic and positively charged amino acids are apparently capable to form a salt bridge with E501, but since the side chain of K is larger than the side chain of R, the distance of this salt bridge is shorter (2.8 \u00c5) in G bound to mammalian ephrin\u2010B2 compared with G bound to mammalian ephrin\u2010B3 (4.3 \u00c5). In the bat ephrin\u2010B2, the shorter R is present and thus the adaptive sites I384, K386 and especially T498 might modulate the interaction between G and ephrin\u2010B2 which might be required to facilitate the host jump from bats to humans.",

Moreover, different genotypes are associated with different fatality rates and transmission characteristics (Sharma, Kaushik, Kumar, Yadav, & Kaushik, 2019), but no study reported on genome differences between genotypes and whether adaptive evolution occurred during NiV spillover from bats to other mammals, especially to humans.

Interestingly, Thailand and Cambodia, as two countries locate between Malaysia and Bangladesh, different lineages of NiV were identified in local bat population. And epidemiological investigations on NiV in Philippines, Indonesia, East Timor, three countries which are close to Malaysia, also suggest the sequences of NiV that circulates in their counties are more similar to Malaysia lineage NiV, which is consistent with our results (Breed et al., 2013; Ching et al., 2015; Sendow et al., 2013). Bats, the second largest order of mammals after rodents, harbour more than 200 types of viruses, including many that are highly pathogenic for humans (e.g. rabies virus, Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV), Hendra virus (HeV). NiV circulates within bat populations via close mutual contact when bats crowd together. Moreover, bats can fly over long distances and thus can spread the virus from country to country. The bats of the genus Pteropod have long\u2010range flight capabilities, suggesting that neighbouring countries, such as China should also strengthen NiV surveillance (Figure S2).",

Thus, NiV is highly variable, which makes disease prevention, control and vaccine development difficult. Of note, we found a significant relationship between NiV and geography, except for Cambodia, which may be due to the limited number of available sequences from this region.

None of the G protein adaptive sites are in direct contact with amino acids of ephrin\u2010B2 or ephrin\u2010B3. However, adaptive amino acids were identified near the second interaction site which comprises a hydrogen\u2010bonding network between Q388 and Y389 in G and the negatively charged D108 in both ephrin\u2010B2 and ephrin\u2010B3 and a salt bridge between negatively charged E501 in G and a basic residue at position 106 in ephrin. Interestingly, the identity of the basic amino acid varies: in bats and other mammalians ephrin\u2010B3 and in the bat ephrin\u2010B2 it is an arginine, whereas in the mammalian ephrin\u2010B2 a lysine is present. Since the side chain of lysine is longer, the distance between E501 in G and the basic residue in ephrin becomes shorter and as a consequence probably the strength of the interaction increases. We speculate that for bat\u2010derived NiV to adapt to the human ephrin\u2010B2 receptor the adaptive sites at position 384, 386 and especially 498 might modulate the receptor\u2010binding affinity and might thus contribute to a host jump. Interestingly, the G protein of a henipavirus recently isolated from a bat in Africa does not contain this second interaction site since the amino acids at an equivalent position to Q388 and Y389 do not form hydrogen bonds with D108 in ephrin. As a consequence, the G protein of African bat henipavirus shows decreased ephrin\u2010B2 binding relative to the G protein of NiV (Lee et al., 2015). Thus, hydrogen bonds at the secondary binding site impart affinity and stabilize the receptor\u2010bound complex and even small differences in receptor\u2010binding can translate into significant differences in the efficiency of infection.",

Three of the adaptive sites we found in the G protein, residues 288, 384 and 386, are part of a known antibody epitope (White et al., 2005). NiV adaptation to humans probably depends on the stepwise accumulation of potentiating mutations that favour the emergence of a particular adaptive mutation, similar to the mutations described for the adaption of avian influenza virus to humans (Imai et al., 2018; Su et al., 2017). Therefore, the mutational panel provided here might be very useful as an early detection system for transitional stages in the NiV evolution before it acquires full pandemic potential. We also identified several amino acid changes between two virus lineages which may affect receptor binding and hence transmission. The application of these findings is invaluable not just for veterinarians/virologists but also for public health officers, as the threat of a more serious NiV pandemic is real.",
