            "text": "This paper explores an overly optimistic and tenacious claim in the literature that robotic process automation (RPA) will only free knowledge workers from mundane tasks and introduce more interesting work. We explore this claim and other consequences for knowledge workers using data from a sequential quantitative-qualitative, mixed-method study in Norway. 88 RPA users from different sectors and industries where first surveyed to identify differences in utilization and effects from RPA. Then, differences were explored in 24 in-depth interviews in the public and private sectors, including financial industry, manufacturing, and oil and gas. Results indicate that RPA is used to either layoff or not reemploy knowledge workers, but also to empower knowledge workers with more interesting tasks. Private sector was different from public sector in that private, financial companies have experienced the strongest reduction in the need for employment. RPA often lead to layoffs indirectly, and to reduced need for consultants, especially in financial companies. In contrast, public companies use RPA more for innovations in their service production from increased quality in data registration, handling of invoices, and data migration between systems. We conclude that RPA is maturing as a management tool motivated by cost reductions from reduced employment, and we suggest propositions for further research.",

For knowledge workers, the liberation from mundane tasks is especially important for their productivity [8] . As a result, this would lead to empowerment of knowledge workers who will contribute to companies through applying their convergent, divergent and creative thinking skills rather than being made obsolete. According to Drucker, the first requirement in increasing the productivity of knowledge workers is to find out what their tasks are, what they should be, and which tasks should be eliminated [8] . Since even knowledge workers have mundane and repetitive tasks, it seems reasonable then, to assume that they will also be subjected to lay-offs following automation.",

Following this definition, the result is reproduction of work done by humans by automating their tasks motivated by cost reductions, flexibility, increased speed and resource utilization, improved service capabilities and quality [17] . In the society, we see a growing number of examples of automation and RPA in many industries including the financial industry with banking, insurance and auditing [13, 18] , and in public and private healthcare [20] . This development of automation can be explained by Drucker [8] who claims that the biggest challenge for companies in the 21th century whether business or nonbusiness, will be to increase the productivity of knowledge work and knowledge workers (p. 79). Following Drucker [8] , six factors define not only knowledge work, but also knowledge workers and their productivity: their tasks can be defined, they are autonomous and responsible for their own productivity, they are continuously innovating and learning, not primarily measured on quantity but rather quality, and treated as \"assets\" rather than \"costs\". These factors, following Drucker, except quality, are almost the exact opposite of what characterize manual work and the situation of the manual worker [8] .",

The respondents pointed at the strategic focus on cost efficiency in their industry. Respondent 10 noted: \"Yes, there is a lot of [downsizing] in the finance industry. There are severance packages three times a year.\" The strong push for cost efficiency can be related to increased competition from new entrants with a strong focus on digital transformation of the industry and the society. This has opened up for new actors, such as Apple and Facebook, where Apple launched Apple pay that forces the incumbent actors to push for more efficiency and innovation in systems solutions and business models. Norwegian banks have therefore invested significantly in new IT technology, which has increased costs and resulting in payroll cost reductions. The largest Norwegian bank (DnB) aims to reduce costs by approximately \u20ac200 millions by 2020 using RPA as one of the tools. One respondent (10) noted that his employer did not reveal the full intension behind RPA: \"We got a percentage estimate of the workforce that would be replaced by this. My employer stated quite clearly that no one in Norway would be sacked as a result of this. It was a sales gimmick to make people positive.\" Another respondent (14) from another bank noted that the strategy of headcount reduction started before they implemented RPAbut that RPA has contributed to achieving these strategic goals: \"It was a strategic decision taken before we started with RPA [\u2026]. RPA has been a very important contributor to achieving these goals.\" Respondent 10 added that RPA has influenced recruitingthey do not hire new people; they employ RPA instead. Respondent 14 asserted: \"We have had a quite substantial reduction in headcount, and we process higher volumes than before we started the layoffs.\" Both respondent 10 and 14 argued that as RPA was more employed for layoffs, the attitudes among employees become more negative. Respondent 14 noted that \"People are afraid of losing their jobs [\u2026] . Those who [work in the processes] are not always the ones that are most willing to assist [with the RPA effort].\" The picture is not as dramatic in other industries. Cost reduction and efficiency were a major motivation but without significant effect on layoffs. For many companies, RPA is a way to manage growth and higher process volumes. The respondent from the energy sector noted that there was a push for both cost efficiency and digital transformation. He asserted: \"It has been a strong focus on innovation. [..] There has not been a lot of innovation in this industry [\u2026] but [we] are in a technology shift in relation to digitalization. This comes from corporate management.\" Respondent 5 from the manufacturing industry corroborated that digital transformation was a driver for change and noted: \"we have seen that we can achieve massive cost reductions from using digital technologies. [It implies] new ways of working.\" Respondent 9 from the energy industry commented on headcount reduction: \"No, it is not the goal with RPA. It is more value adding work, pleasurable, less 'mouse arm' and such that are the benefits.\" This was supported in the manufacturing industry where respondent 6 noted: \"We have not laid anyone off, and we have no intentions of doing that.",

One respondent from a municipality noted that cost efficiency was a major motivation for acquiring RPA as an inexpensive way to solve systems integration problems, and that RPA reduced the need for new employees with payroll cost reduction over time. Consequences for knowledge workers All companies interviewed pointed at positive consequences from more efficient work processes with fewer routine tasks, and at new and more important tasks for the company. These tasks were also more meaningful for the employees. Respondent 16 from the public sector asserts: \"It has been a change in tasks where those tasks we still do are those that need human judgement, but we have got rid of those boring tasks [\u2026] so we can concentrate on new and unsolved tasks\". Respondent 15 from a wholesale company adds: \"In our case, workers work more with sales tasks which leads to better market relations and increased salesthis is what makes a salesperson valuable\". Respondent 19 from a bank argues: \"They [workers] do other and newer tasks because it [RPA] frees up capacity to prioritize differently and learn from new insight into process and technology\". Respondent 18 from an energy company also point at learning: \"In those processes where we have had a full-time employee, we are working to find new alternatives for them. Out in the business units there are plenty of tasks to do, so business units are challenged to making sure that we learn to create value in new ways\". Similar stories are told across industries and sectors. Companies point at the increased efficiency created by the removal of routine task, which has created opportunities to take on new tasks and to learn new skills. This means that knowledge workers are freed from mundane tasks and given new and more meaningful opportunities. Still, this is not the whole story. Most companies were reluctant in admitting that knowledge workers could lose their jobs. Rather, they argue that they meet downsizing with automation or that retirement will not be met by recruitment, as respondent 24 from a bank asserts: \"We have removed tasks from the regional offices, which has made us downsize through retirement without laying people off\". Respondent 22 from an energy company points to other effects: \"We have some consultants in the company, so one alternative is not to hire so many of those and [thus] create more value per employee\".",

            "text": "Respondents from the public sector and across private industries point at the communication around potential layoffs as challenging. Informant 20 from a bank reports: \"Cutting costs can be done in many ways. Everybody thinks immediately that people will be fired as the only way of cutting costs. This is totally wrong because you might rather use their time to do tasks that you so far have not been able to do in the company, including new services and tasks that have been neglected for a long time. You can simply do more with the same workforce and thus save money\". The difficulty of talking about layoffs was further elaborated by respondent 23 from a public company: \"You cannot brag too much about how many positions you have saved up because you have to keep managers, workers and unions happy\". This research explored how RPA are used to transform work (RQ1) and what consequences are for knowledge workers (RQ2) in Norwegian organizations. We identified several interesting issues in the quantitative phase that was further explored in the interviews, and in a combined analysis. The main contribution of our work is to refute the assertion that RPA will not lead to layoffs among knowledge workers [14] . Our findings demonstrate no reason to believe that knowledge workers are exempt from the consequences of RPA. While RPA has mainly been seen as a tool for liberating knowledge workers from tedious tasks, we found that RPA is indeed used for layoffs among knowledge workers, particularly in the finance industry. This industry has longer experience with the RPA than other industries and the public sector in our data, and it is reasonable to assume that financial companies are among the most mature RPA users. The finance industry had significantly more reduction in headcount than the other industries. The interviews showed that the reduction came from reduced hiring and layoffs, even though RPA in one instance was sold in as not leading to layoffs, but indeed used in this way eventually. This contrasts case studies of Lacity, Willcocks and Craig [15, 16] and the assertion that RPA will not lead to layoffs among knowledge workers [14] . One might ask why the myth that RPA will not lead to layoffs for knowledge workers seems so persistent? Obviously, being open with the fact that knowledge workers risk losing their jobs would create socio-political resistance against RPA. Resistance from knowledge workers is probably more challenging than resistance from regular workers, and silence to avoid resistance, combined with the likelihood that reduced need for knowledge workers emerges over time, stand out as a potential explanation for the myth. Until recently, it was perceived that jobs susceptible to automaton were in the middle of the workforce skill spectrum [9] , leading to a decrease in jobs in this skill spectrum [10] . Technological development in cognitive IT technologies such as AI and machine learning enables automation of tasks that require human judgment [13, 17] . We argue that when RPA applications are programmed to access such cognitive IT applications, they can automate most knowledge worker assessments and reduce the need for most types of knowledge workers.",

The management of any organization will always be looking for ways to improve the bottom line, and we argue that RPA is a handy tool for reducing personnel costs. We further conjecture that RPA will enter the management's standard toolbox as organizations become more mature RPA-users, and RPA will be used to reduce personnel costs. For organizations needing to reduce costs and improve efficiency, like businesses in the finance industry, layoffs are relevant. Thus, we raise the following proposition: P1: As organizations gain experience with the RPA technology, they will use it more extensively for reducing personnel costs, including laying off among knowledge workers.",

It not surprising that RPA has been utilized for achieving cost reduction. We believe that the same logic applies for any industry with a low differentiation, and for companies with a cost-leadership strategy in any industry. We therefore argue that organizations or industries with little differentiation, and thus a strong focus on cost leadership, will find RPA attractive for reducing costs. We raise the following propositions: P2: Industries with little product or service differentiation will use RPA more for reducing personnel costs, including laying off knowledge workers. P3: Organizations with little product or service differentiation will use RPA more for reducing personnel costs, including laying off knowledge workers.",

RPA can be a valuable tool to improve public sector services, especially in public sector health enterprises struggling to cope with a growing need for elderly healthcare in Norway as in other industrialized countries. We saw that municipalities used RPA for reducing payroll expenses, and we argue that even if organizations in the short term may use RPA to free up knowledge workers for more meaningful tasks, RPA will eventually enter management's standard toolbox, and be used to cutting personnel costs among knowledge workers. Some benefits will be achieved by giving employees new job assignments, but we argue that knowledge workers are not exempt from economic reality and may become redundant. We expect that RPA will lead to layoffs of knowledge workers, and we forward the following propositions: P4: RPA will be used to improve service quality in the public sector. P5: RPA will lead to layoffs among knowledge workers in the public sector.",

These findings illustrate that operational tasks are the most important application area related to the creation of products or services. In the finance industry such processes could be loan application processing, and in the manufacturing industry it could be quality documentation processing. Further research should address how RPA is utilized in various functions and look at variations in the effects.",
