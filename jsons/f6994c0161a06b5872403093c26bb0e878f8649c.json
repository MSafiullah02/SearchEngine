These diseases can produce high morbidity and mortality. 1 There have been several incidents of emerging respiratory infectious diseases in the last hundred years, including the influenza pandemic of 1918 known as the 'Spanish flu', the 'Asian flu' pandemic in 1957, the 'Hong Kong flu' pandemic in 1968, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic in 2003, and the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic of April 2009. 2 All these events demonstrate the importance of having a surveillance system for respiratory infections that can detect new viruses rapidly and provide information to assess impact on the population and having operational preparedness plans. 3 Influenza, with its capability for mutational changes, is one of these major respiratory infectious diseases with a high potential of transmissibility among humans. 4 Influenza causes a wide range of clinical illnesses ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe hospitalized disease and death.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 203, "end": 204, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 565, "end": 566, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 808, "end": 809, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 975, "end": 976, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Humans, as well as viruses, can now easily circumnavigate the globe in less than 24 hours. 5 Influenza typically presents with sudden onset of fever accompanied by headache, sore throat, myalgia, malaise, anorexia and dry cough. Symptoms may be atypical in young children and the elderly. 6 The most common complication of influenza is pneumonia, which may be a primary viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia, most commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pyogenes. A wide range of other complications may occur less commonly, including neurologic, cardiac and musculoskeletal diseases. 7 Surveillance of influenza is important for determining the timing and spread of the virus, for tracking changes in circulating viruses to recognize the seasonal influenza vaccine composition, and as an alert mechanism for potential pandemic viruses. 5 Sentinel influenza surveillance focuses on the two extreme presentations of the disease: influenza-like illness (ILI) sentinel surveillance, which monitors persons with milder forms of the disease seeking outpatient care, and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) sentinel surveillance, which is aimed to identify persons with severe forms of the disease who have been admitted to a hospital for treatment. 8 Effective SARI surveillance includes the element of influenza sentinel surveillance, namely, the collection of data from a limited number of surveillance sites, complementing the routine surveillance. This approach enhances the quality of epidemiologic and laboratory data on influenza and strengthens a country's capacity for detection and prevention of severe cases of seasonal, novel and pandemic influenza. Improved epidemiological understanding of the influenza viruses and their seasonal trends is critical for effectively preparing for epidemics as well as pandemics. 9 The SARI surveillance system in Egypt is employed for suspected novel influenza viruses, pneumonia and avian influenza surveillance; the programme started in early 2006. It has been leveraged for the detection and testing of suspected cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). 10 It is important to mention that avian influenza is endemic in Egypt; human cases of influenza A (H5N1) have been reported annually since 2006, and a total of 346 human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1), including 116 deaths (case fatality rate-CFR: 33.5%), have been reported in Egypt up to December 2015. 11 This study aimed to describe the epidemiology of circulating viruses among SARI patients admitted to a sentinel site in Egypt during the study period and identify the symptoms associated with SARI cases among these patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 91, "end": 92, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 289, "end": 290, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 665, "end": 666, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 917, "end": 918, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1330, "end": 1331, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1907, "end": 1908, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2210, "end": 2212, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2519, "end": 2521, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "\u2022 Surveillance site: The data included in this study were collected from a major SARI sentinel site in Egypt during the period from January 2013 to December 2015. \u2022 Selected data: All SARI patients who were admitted to the sentinel site in Egypt during three consecutive years (2013, 2014 and 2015) and met the World Health Organization Case Definition for Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) within the same period of the study, were included in the data analysis process. \u2022 Case definition: Cases involved an acute respiratory infection with a history of fever or measured fever of \u2265 38\u00b0C and cough, with an onset within the last ten days and a requirement for hospitalization. 12 week and year against the number of SARI-positive cases over the study period to show the influenza peaks and seasonal variation and the influenza virus types and subtypes.
