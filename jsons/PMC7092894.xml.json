HCV E1 protein was chosen as a positive control, as it has been shown to be able to increase membrane permeability when overexpressed in E. coli cells [5]. As shown in Fig. 1\nA, expression of 3a and 3b proteins rendered no obvious effects on the growth of bacteria, compared with bacterial cells carrying the empty plasmid pET24a. Certain degrees of retardation of bacterial growth were observed in cells expressing the E, 6, and 7a and HCV E1 proteins (Fig. 1A).",

Fig. 1B shows the presence of protein bands with apparent molecular masses of 9.3 (lane 1), 32 (lane 2), 18.5 (lane 3), 14.8 (lane 5), and 21.7 kDa (lane 6), corresponding to the expected His-tagged E, 3a, 3b, and 7a and HCV E1 proteins, respectively. However, no band corresponding to the His-tagged protein 6 (8.5 kDa) was detected (Fig. 1B, lane 4). To confirm the expression and identities of these proteins, Western blot analysis was conducted using anti-His antibody. The 9.3-kDa E protein (lane 7), 32-kDa 3a protein (lane 8), 14.8-kDa 7a protein (lane 11), and 21.7-kDa HCV E1 protein (lane 12) were detected, confirming the expression of these proteins. However, the antibody fails to react with the 3b protein (Fig. 1B, lane 9). The reason for the failure to detect the His-tagged 3b protein is currently uncertain. Once again, no obvious band corresponding to protein 6 was detected (Fig. 1B, lane 10), indicating the expression of this protein at a very low level in the bacterial cells. As significant inhibition of the growth of bacterial cells carrying this gene was observed (Fig. 1A), it suggests that the protein may be highly toxic to bacteria. This protein was excluded in the subsequent studies. It was also noted that induction of the empty vector, pET24a, affects the growth of bacteria carrying the plasmid, compared with bacteria carrying pET24-3a and pET24-3b (Fig. 1A). This may reflect the fact that overexpression of the multiple cloning site-His tag region in pET24a might affect bacterial growth.",

When the cell membrane permeability is altered, it can translocate into cells to block cellular protein translation. Cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 15 min after addition of HB. Expression of SARS-CoV E protein allows the entry of HB to cells, as host protein synthesis was completely blocked (Fig. 2\nA, lanes 1 and 2). Similar inhibitory effect on host protein synthesis was observed in bacterial cells expressing the positive control protein, HCV E1 protein (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6).

To analyze the involvement of these cysteine residues in the oliogomerization of E protein, site-directed mutagenesis of these cysteine residues to alanine either individually or in combination of two or three was made to generate five mutants (M1\u2013M5). Mutant M1 contains mutation at the C1 position, M2 at C2, and M3 at C3. M4 contains mutations at both the C1 and C2 positions, and M5 contains mutations at all three positions. These mutants were then expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). As can be seen in Fig. 4A, expression of wild type E protein and mutant M2 showed obvious induction of membrane permeability, as significant inhibition of protein synthesis by HB was observed (lanes 1 and 2; and lanes 5 and 6). Expression of mutants M1, M3, M4, and M5 showed no obvious increase of membrane permeability to HB (Fig. 4A, lanes 3, 4, and 7\u201312), indicating that these mutations may abolish the function of E protein in its induction of membrane permeability in bacterial cells. These results demonstrate that C1 and C3 residues are crucial for the function of E protein.",

These proteins contain at least one transmembrane domain that interacts with and expands the lipid bilayer, and could form hydrophilic pores in the membrane by oligomerization, with hydrophilic residues presumably facing the aqueous lumen of the pore [4], [7]. The hydrophilic channels would allow low molecular weight hydrophilic molecules across the membrane barrier, leading to the disruption of membrane potential, collapse of ionic gradients, and release of essential compounds from the cell. Alterations in ion concentration, such as enhancing the intracellular concentration of sodium ions, in the cytoplasm of virus-infected cells at the beginning of viral protein synthesis would favor virus replication. This would promote translation of viral versus cellular mRNAs, as translation of mRNAs from many cytolytic animal viruses is fairly resistant to high sodium concentrations. In contrast, high sodium concentrations are inhibitory to the translation of most cellular mRNAs [4], [7]. Progressive membrane damage during viral replication cycles would also result in cell lysis, promote virus release, and facilitate virus spread to surrounding cells. Disruption of the function of viroporins would therefore abrogate viral infectivity, rendering this group of viral proteins suitable targets for the development of antiviral drugs.",
