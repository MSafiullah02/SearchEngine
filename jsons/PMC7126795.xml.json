            "text": "Particulate matter (PM) is documented as a significant threat to global health [1]. For the past few decades the concern has been steered towards ambient air quality. After the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and various avian influenza worldwide, there has been a speedy rush in studying the building-related factors which are linked to the risk in airborne transmitted pathogens and indoor air quality (IAQ). The increasing concern over IAQ has highlighted the need for ventilation strategies suitable to control pollutant concentrations in indoor environments of buildings. One major challenge is the control of indoor particulate matter (PM) concentration, which is governed by a complex set of engineering factors and physical processes [2], [3]. Indoor particles can be generated from either indoor or outdoor sources. Indoor particles may arise from sources such as office printers, occupant activity, combustion related activities such as stove cooking [4], and resuspension of deposited particles as a result of walking [5]. For residential buildings outdoor particles can enter buildings through penetration building cracks or window frames [6] whereas for commercial buildings, particles entry pathways are mainly through mechanical ventilation systems [7], [8], [9], [10]. In fact, the increase of indoor fine particles concentration is mainly affected by outdoor traffic condition particularly in urban district [11], [12], [13].",

For instance, researchers have identified the major indoor sources of PM contributing to elevated airborne particles level, as reviewed elsewhere [3]. Theoretical work has also been drawn to carry analysis of ventilation strategies for indoor dynamical particle sources [14] and dilution of PM coming from indoor or outdoor sources [15], [16], [17]. Even the current ASHRAE 62.1, \u201cVentilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality\u201d, suggests that the ventilation rate is determined by the number of people and the floor size of building [18]. Therefore ventilation requirement for floor area deals with the contaminants emitting from indoor environments.",

This has been an important energy conservation consideration for air conditioning engineers for past decades [19], [20]. Demand-controlled ventilation (DCV), which provides way in the control of fresh air rate with both IAQ and energy efficiency is taken into account [21]. The most common method is CO2-based DCV, which is particularly valuable in densely occupied environments such as offices, lecture theatre, and public buildings [22]. Based on the new standard ASHRAE 62.1, researchers have designed new implementation strategies of CO2-based DCV under this new standard [23], [24], [25]. It should be clear that fresh air supply will be increased with the number of occupancy in an indoor environment, and highly polluted atmosphere can make the low efficiency filters, which are widely used nowadays due to economical consideration, deemed insufficient for maintaining acceptable IAQ.",

We first conducted a series of full-scale environmental chamber experiments by modelling a ventilated built environment and an outdoor environment polluted by fine particles. Next, a state-space model for the dynamics of CO2 and airborne polydisperse particles recently developed by our group is applied to analyse the trend in the experimental findings. Afterwards, we performed an exhaustive case study using a new mathematical model. Both the experimental and the theoretical results support that the dilution of CO2 with either CAV or CO2-based demand-controlled VAV causes an undesirable increase in indoor particle concentrations. This intricate relationship between CO2 and particle concentrations will pose a serious challenge in the development of effective ventilation system for particle populated outdoor environment.",

The chamber represents a typical office room with a variable refrigerant volume (VRV) air-conditioning system. A CO2 tank with a regulator was used to mimic the exhalation process of human subjects inside the office, and a heater box was introduced to replicate the thermal load in the space. According to the ASHRAE Standard 62.1 [18], the average CO2 released by one sedentary person is 0.31 L/min; therefore, the CO2 generation was adjusted at a rate of 0.62 L/min for simulating an office with two persons inside. Usually, a lightly working or resting adult produces about 100 W of heat [27]. Therefore a heater box (0.6 m \u00d7 0.3 m \u00d7 1 m) with one 200 W light bulb was used in a simulation of a two-person working space. A fan was installed inside the heater box to ensure that the generated heat is evenly distributed within the box. A schematic diagram of the entire experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1\n. Before starting the experiments, leakage test was conducted. Differential pressure of 20 Pa was applied and measured by a manometer when CO2 was simultaneously injected to the room. Best-fitting of the CO2 decay plot yielded the leakage rate, which is approximately 0.1 ACH under the specified pressure difference of 20 Pa and can be ignored compared to the supply air rate.",

All other particles larger than 10.0 \u03bcm were also recorded in a separate bin. The unit recorded was in number per litre. The system parameters in this study were carefully chosen in order to best match the practical values. Two different ventilation rates were applied. A normal ventilation rate for a two-person office is 20 L/s, while 30 L/s was used for achieving a higher air quality. The choice of particle concentration is based field measurement at heavy traffic locations [28]; particle concentration recorded is nearly 9.0 \u00d7 104 particle/cm3. Therefore, 9.0 \u00d7 104 and 5.0 \u00d7 104 particle/cm3 were chosen to represent the worst and worse ambient cases, respectively. Four filters with different filtration efficiencies of 65% and a thickness of 150 mm was were tested herein, namely 150 mm thickness with 95% efficiency, 300 mm thickness with 95% efficiency, 150 mm thickness with 65% efficiency and 300 mm thickness with 65% efficiency.",

The summarized results are shown on Table 3, Table 4, Table 5\n. First of all, it should be noted that the CO2 concentration under three different particle concentrations is at the same level under the same fresh air flow rate because the efficiency of mechanical filter does not affect the CO2 concentration. The trend in the tables have also shown that high fresh air flow will trigger the room CO2 concentration to attain the steady state faster while lower ventilation rate delays CO2 concentration to reach steady state. As anticipated, the CO2 concentration is found to be inversely proportional to the ventilation rate, i.e. the higher the fresh air flow rate, the lower the CO2 concentration level was resulted.

Inferring from Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, for CAV cases under this ventilation rate, the maximum CO2 concentration level is around 1000 ppm while the 12 h average is 855 ppm. The other two ventilation rates 12.75 L/s/p and 17 L/s/p give the average CO2 concentration level of around 710 ppm and 635 ppm respectively. By inferring from the results, fresh air flow rate of 8.5 L/s/p would result in good class while the other two fresh air rates would fall into excellent class based on the HKEPD requirement. However, it should be noted that there will not have energy saving even during less people accommodated period under CAV fresh air supply.",

            "text": "For CAV cases, the particle concentrations of indoor air increases to steady level fairly fast within 1 h. Afterwards, these particle concentrations are maintained at the same level during the rest of the operation period. It is found that filtration efficiency significantly influences PM concentration. For instance, under outdoor air particle concentration of 50 \u03bcg/m3 and fresh air flow rate of 8.5 L/s/p, filters with 40%, 60% and 80% filtration efficiency gives the mean PM1.0-1.99 values of 11.4 \u03bcg/m3, 6.0 \u03bcg/m3 and 2.5 \u03bcg/m3 in 12 h, respectively. These results as mentioned above are all considered to be low. Nevertheless, when the filter efficiency is low, outdoor condition is adverse and fresh air flow rate is high, the indoor PM level cannot be ignored. Inferring from Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, when outdoor concentration is 100 \u03bcg/m3, two cases exceed the WHO guideline which occurs at the 40% filter efficiency and the highest ventilation rate. The trend as mentioned above suggests that high fresh air flow rate does not always give better IAQ. When the outdoor condition is worsened with PM concentrations of 200 \u03bcg/m3, five out of six results of two lowest filter efficiency cases exceed the guideline considerably. One may considers lowering the fresh air flow rate under this adverse condition, leading to an increase of CO2 level but in only marginal level. Another possible measure is to install filter with efficiency >80%. This will increase the air-conditioning running cost whenever the system is operating. In fact if the outdoor PM level is very high, in order to lower exposure, indoor cleaning devices, such as those install air filtration systems, can be an option. In fact this measure has been becoming more popular aiming at providing enhanced filtration during adverse ambient conditions [38].",

Under a fixed ventilation rate, the maximum CO2 concentration is the same as that of the CAV case. The average concentration is calculated in Table 3, Table 4, Table 5. Good class can still be obtained under 8.5 L/s/p and excellent class can be obtained when 12.75 L/s or 17 L/s fresh air flow rates are provided. However, slight difference can be observed and the trend is that VAV scheme would result in higher CO2 concentration. Besides, the temporal variation between CAV and VAV is obvious. Under the VAV scheme, the CO2 concentration is kept constant during the operation periods. This is because the fresh air is varied based on the number of people accommodated in the office space. The total fresh air is designed to dilute the exact CO2 which is generated by exact occupants. Therefore, the ventilation system seems like a CO2-based DCV operation. In this case energy saving can be achieved during less people accommodation period. On the other hand, the particle concentrations level varies due to variation of the total supply of fresh air. Less fresh air causes less particle concentration indoors. The calculated mean as shown in Table 3, Table 4, Table 5 shows that the particle concentrations mean values for CAV cases are consistently higher than those of VAV cases approximately 16%\u201324%. Besides the more the fresh air supplied, the more the energy is being consumed. By comparing between CAV and VAV cases, the energy impact in CAV case is quite obvious. It is because under the CAV the total ventilation air is kept at constant regardless of the people number. However, the energy supply for cooling and dehumidifying the hot and humid outdoor air is fixed. On the other hand, under the VAV case energy consumption is based on CO2-based DCV. Thus the energy demand is varied over operation period. It would result in less total energy consumption than that of the CAV case. Although it is not the scope of the present work, the energy consumption can be calculated by the ventilation air rate and its temperature different between outdoor and indoor temperature in terms of enthalpy.",

In this study, a state-space model was first validated by in-house experiments under both steady and unsteady ventilation rates. Good agreement between the experimental measurement and model prediction with respect to particle and CO2 concentrations were found. Twenty-seven case scenarios studies were conducted from both CAV and VAV cases to explore the relationship among filter efficiency, ventilation rate, outdoor PM level and modes of ventilation. Normal ventilation rate of 8.5 L/s/p can lead to CO2 concentration lower than 1000 ppm at CAV fresh air supply. Notwithstanding, the other two highest ventilation air flow rates results in even lower CO2 concentration, however, it does not always give better IAQ if ambient PM level is severe. The results support the existence of an interaction between PM and CO2 concentrations. It is shown that high efficiency filter plays a key role in the management of indoor PM concentration. In tackling those adverse ambient conditions, filter with efficiency >80% to be implemented is suggested. The result also shows that 16\u201324% less particle concentrations mean values were found in VAV cases than those in CAV cases. Our results also show that CAV and VAV systems, under low ACH situations, can meet the requirements of the particle and CO2 concentrations of WHO 2005 [36] and HKEPD [37] standards. This study confirms that a dilemma to be further studied may occur in heavily polluted cities: dilution of indoor CO2 concentration by introducing outdoor air probably import other pollutants outdoors, such as particles.",
