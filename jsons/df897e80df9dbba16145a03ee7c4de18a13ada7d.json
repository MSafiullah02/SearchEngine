In particular, nineteen diseases not listed in the previous diseases prioritization exercises have been identified and represent a major concern for cattle holders while not necessarily addressed by a national control program for now.Discrepancies between the vet survey (DS1) and laboratory data (DS2) for 13 diseases are mainly explained by the fact that they are usually diagnosed and treated in the field, on the basis of clinical signs. It is the case for the two diseases showing the most significant disease index but not coming out from DS 2 analysis (mastitis and interdigital dermatitis).Neosporosis and paratuberculosis did not show an increasing trend but are frequently suspected by the RVP. Furthermore, they are both part of a national control program with a mean of, respectively, 155,379 and 290,057 annual test requests (DS2). A real increase was therefore unlikely.Six diseases showed a significant increase through analysis of laboratory databases, but not from the RVP' point of view. Indeed, the number of tests requested over the last 3 years increased for BEL, leptospirosis, and bluetongue. Even though Belgium was declared as BEL-officially free in 1997(AFSCA, 2017a,b), it is still tested in parallel with brucellosis to maintain this status (CODA-CERVA, Riocreux Flavien personal communication) and do not represent a real increase of suspicions. Its classification as \"important\" could therefore be reconsidered. For both leptospirosis and bluetongue, the number of test requests increased significantly in 2015, despite a low frequency reported by RVP. This could be related to increased surveillance motivated by bluetongue outbreaks in France and suspected outbreaks of leptospirosis in Belgium. Indeed, for leptospirosis, a peak of abortions, with icteric syndrome, was observed during the first half of 2014, which led to increased testing(Delooz et al., 2015). In addition, subclinical infections are frequently reported with bluetongue(Brenner et al., 2010).We observed more than 25% of positive results for Bo-HV4 disease, Schmallenberg disease and cryptosporidiosis. These diseases were not listed as frequent, increasing or important by the RVP. Previous studies have confirmed the endemic status of Bo-HV4 in southern Belgium, along with a high seroconversion rate of cows(Delooz, Czaplicki, Houtain, Dal Pozzo, & Saegerman, 2016). Nevertheless, the relationship between Bo-HV4 and abortion is still subject to controversy and the disease might be underranked by the RVP due to the nonpathognomonic character of clinical signs. In order to further assess the role of Bo-HV4 in abortions, a recent study included the search of the virus in the abortion protocol already implemented in southern Belgium(Delooz et al., 2016;Delooz, Czaplicki, Houtain, Mullender, & Saegerman, 2012) and highlighted a possible association; specific awareness raising messages were F I G U R E 3 Reported trend score for the 24 diseases with a high or significant global score (N = 107).

Once the farmer has engaged into a behaviour change and is convinced of the efficiency and relevance of biosecurity, the introduction of additional measures will be accepted easily.
