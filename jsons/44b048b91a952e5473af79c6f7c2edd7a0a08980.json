In search for a platform with shorter turnaround time, we sought to evaluate the recently released Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 assay which is capable of producing positive results in as little as 5 minutes. We present here the result comparisons between Abbot ID NOW COVID-19 and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal swabs transported in VTM as well as dry nasal swabs for the Abbott assay. Regardless of method of collection and sample type, Abbot ID NOW COVID-19 missed a third of the samples detected positive by Cepheid Xpert Xpress when using NP swabs in VTM and over 48% when using dry nasal swabs.",

The initiative to expand and accelerate testing has eased the usual scrutiny that new assays would normally undergo prior to release. This obligates clinical laboratories to more carefully assess the overall performance of the various rapidly emerging testing platforms prior to implementation. Several Nucleic Acid Amplification tests (NAAT) platforms are currently available. Our laboratory uses two real time RT-PCR platforms, the Roche Cobas and the Cepheid GeneXpert. Both platforms perform comparably with similar limits of detection (LOD) of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA, 100-150 and 250 copies/mL, respectively. However, the assay run times of 3.5 hours and 45 minutes, respectively, are still too long for timely decision support in a variety or important clinical situations. (e.g. Emergency Department discharge). In search for a platform with shorter turnaround time, we sought to evaluate the recently released Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 assay. Abbott ID NOW uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification of the RdRp viral target with a claimed LOD of 125 copies/mL. The objective of our study was to evaluate the performance of the rapid Abbott-ID-NOW platform test by using the Cepheid-Xpert-Xpress SARS-CoV-2 test on the GeneXpert Dx as the comparator reference method.",

The specimens were collected, placed in VTM and run on the GeneXpert Dx. This platform automates and integrates sample preparation, nucleic acid extraction and amplification, and detection of the target sequences. The assay detects 2 nucleic acid targets, namely N2 (nucleocapsid) and E (envelope) wherein N2 is more specific for SARS-CoV-2. The lowest limit of detection (LOD) for this assay is claimed by the manufacturer to be 250 copies/mL. SARS-CoV-2 genomic load is assessed using the number of amplification cycles needed for a positive PCR test (i.e. the cycle threshold [Ct] value). Ct values have an inverse relationship to viral loads and thereby provide a surrogate measurement of the viral genomic load (7) . Consequently, the higher the viral load, the lower the Ct value of a particular specimen and vice versa.",

For this analysis, rather than using specimen dilution to simulate a series of decreasing viral loads, a set of 8 previously tested specimens in the Xpert Xpress assay were selected with increasing N2 Ct values ranging from 32.6 to 41.8. All samples were tested on the ID NOW platform and the results compared to those previously obtained on the Cepheid GeneXpert. 8 For all the comparisons mentioned above, all samples were nasopharyngeal swabs transported to the lab in VTM. In response to our findings of lower sensitivity of the ID NOW compared to the GeneXpert, Abbott communicated to us that despite the indications in the package insert, their assay was not optimized for testing nasopharyngeal swabs in VTM; the best performance would be from dry nasal swabs obtained at the point of care (POC). They indicated that they would be modifying their package insert to reflect this change (ID NOW COVID-19 Product Insert, IN190000 Rev.3 2020/04:6-8.). Since the Abbott ID NOW rapid results feature was regarded as a worthwhile advantage over our other assays in use, we compared dry nasal swab (both nares) tested on the Abbott platform versus NP in VTM tested on the Cepheid platform. Both samples were obtained in parallel from patients with suspected COVID-19, seen at the NYU Langone Health Tisch Hospital Emergency Department. Although Abbott indicated that the dry swab could be transported in the same sleeve in which the swabs were packaged, we considered the safety of this modality and chose a sterile tube instead. A total of 101 paired samples collected during 12 hour shifts over 3 consecutive days were included. Ninety-three percent of the samples were transported to the laboratory within 1 hour for testing, the remainder within 2 hours. Testing at the point of care was not practical.",
