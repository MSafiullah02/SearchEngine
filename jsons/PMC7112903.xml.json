            "text": "Upper respiratory tract infections are the most common cause of acute physical illness in the developed world and the observation that they are followed by acute asthma exacerbations has been known for a long period of time (Lambert and Stern, 1972, Sluder, 1919). However, it was only with the advent of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection methods that it was confirmed that the presence of Rhinovirus (RV) and other respiratory viruses may be associated with 80\u201385% of asthma exacerbations in children, and more than 50% in adults (Johnston, 1995, Nicholson et al., 1993). It is still unknown whether the remaining 15\u201350% cases are exclusively due to non-viral factors, or that there are still methodological issues in viral detection (Papadopoulos et al., 2003). Furthermore, upper respiratory tract infections in childhood are associated with complications such as otitis media (Chantzi et al., 2006), sinusitis (Pitkaranta et al., 1997), pneumonia (Tsolia et al., 2004) and acute bronchiolitis (Papadopoulos et al., 2002, Xepapadaki et al., 2004). Confirmation of a viral aetiology for respiratory infections is important both for clinical diagnosis as antiviral treatments are becoming available, and for studying respiratory viruses and their interaction with the respiratory tract (Hayden, 2004). Successful detection of a respiratory virus depends on many variables, including sampling for nasal secretions, which may considerably influence the detection rates (Ahluwalia et al., 1987, Barnes et al., 1989, Covalciuc et al., 1999, Frayha et al., 1989, Heikkinen et al., 2001, Heikkinen et al., 2002, Xiang et al., 2002). Several recent studies have attempted to compare different nasal sampling methods (usually no more than two), using mainly detection methods other than PCR, without reaching a clear conclusion (Ahluwalia et al., 1987, Barnes et al., 1989, Covalciuc et al., 1999, Frayha et al., 1989, Heikkinen et al., 2001, Heikkinen et al., 2002, Xiang et al., 2002). Furthermore, nasal sampling can be unpleasant, reducing cooperation especially in epidemiological studies that require repeated sampling; this aspect has not been studied before. We hypothesized that there might be significant differences between sampling methods in both virus detection rates and patient acceptance.",

In total, 58 patients (60% female, age range 7\u201389 years, median 35 years, mean 39.2 years) were enrolled in the study, after obtaining informed consent.

A total of 0.5\u20131 ml of mucus and 5 ml of sterile normal saline, used to wash all the material from the tubing, was obtained. (iii) Nasal washes were performed after 2.5 ml of normal saline were instilled in one nostril (older patients were asked to avoid swallowing).

In the Allergy Research Center, 2nd Department of Pediatrics, University of Athens, single pathogen RT-PCRs were performed for the detection of RV, Influenza virus and Adenovirus. RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Two-microliter aliquots of the isolated RNA were diluted in Tris\u2013Cl pH 7.5 and RNA yield, concentration and purity were determined spectrophotometrically using an Eppendorf BioPhotometer (Hamburg, Germany). Reverse transcription (cDNA synthesis) was performed in 20 \u03bcl reactions using 8 \u03bcl RNA, Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamers according to the manufacturer's instructions.",

PCR for RV was done with 6 \u03bcl cDNA and OL26 and OL27 primers (Papadopoulos et al., 2000). PCR for Influenza virus (serotypes AH1, AH3, B) was done in two rounds (nested-PCR); in the first round mixture 4 \u03bcl of cDNA were added and 2 \u03bcl of primary product were then transferred to 48 \u03bcl of the secondary amplification mixture using a second primer set internal to that of the first round (Stockton et al., 1998). PCR for Adenovirus was done with 4 \u03bcl of cDNA in a single round, according to Freymuth et al. (1997). Samples were amplified in a PTC-200 DNA Engine thermocycler (MJ Research, MA, USA), with an initial denaturation step at 94 \u00b0C for 2 min and then under conditions described in Table 1\n.",

In order to increase the detection rates, only patients with common cold symptoms participated in the study. The samples were paired, as the four techniques were applied to the participants in a single visit, at the same time-point of the disease. Two PCR techniques for viral detection were employed, conventional RT-PCR and a real-time Taqman multiplex assay, targeting 10 common respiratory viral pathogens. Viral cultures have been used in the past as the gold standard in viral detection; however adoption of PCR techniques is associated with higher virus detection rates (Freymuth et al., 1999, Xiang et al., 2002). Furthermore, the multicenter character of the present study allowed the evaluation of differences in the viral detection rates due to application of the sampling methods in different centers. With respect to this, aspirates and washes exhibited more homogeneity between centers and could therefore be preferable for multicenter studies. These two methods are more complicated, however their application is based on more standardised protocols.",

Among these, some found nasal aspirates and washes superior to nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs for the detection of respiratory pathogens (Ahluwalia et al., 1987, Covalciuc et al., 1999, Frayha et al., 1989, Heikkinen et al., 2001, Heikkinen et al., 2002). In contrast, other comparative studies obtained adequate viral yields from nasopharyngeal swabs and nasal brushes, for the detection of viruses using immunofluorescent assays and cultures (Barnes et al., 1989, Frayha et al., 1989). Furthermore, Heikkinen et al. (Heikkinen et al., 2001, Heikkinen et al., 2002) reported comparable viral detection rates between nasal swabs and nasopharyngeal aspirates (for all the viruses tested except RSV) using viral culture and immunofluorescent assays. A possible explanation for these discrepancies could be the use of immunofluorescent assays in these studies, in which pathogen detection depends on the number of cells obtained from the patient.",

In contrast, nasal brushes produced the lowest rates of viral detection and demonstrated the highest level of patient discomfort. Detection rates from nasal swabs and aspirates were lower than these of washes and higher than these of brushes, however differences were non-significant. This is in agreement with previous findings, which demonstrated comparable detection rates between nasal swabs, brushes and aspirates; though a larger sample size may be needed to define the significance of these slight differences.",
