The virus laden bio-aerosols like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1-A influenza generated by infected occupants through coughing or sneezing can be transported throughout the cabin and infect other occupants, as reported by Wilder-Smith [1] and Baker et al. [2]. In residential buildings and other indoor environments, people are continuously exposed to different air pollutants. Aerosol particles are regarded as major pollutant sources, and they are closely related to such adverse health effects [3]. Other pollutants, such as formaldehyde and volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) can increase the risk of chronic toxicity and even cancer due to prolonged and high-dose exposure [4]. Therefore, it is important to study mechanisms involved in spreading of airborne contaminants, in order to prevent transmission and make a quick respond for chemical and biological attacks in enclosed environments as well.",

            "text": "For airborne contaminant transport, turbulent Schmidt number (Sc\nt) which represents the ratio between turbulent kinematic viscosity and turbulent diffusion coefficient is a key parameter for contaminant concentration prediction in turbulent airflow. Previous researchers have investigated the effect of Sc\nt on predicted contaminant dispersion for different situations. Sc\nt values ranged from 0.6 to 0.9 in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for urban diffusion problems [[5], [6], [7]]. For jet flow simulations, Sc\nt values were suggested to be 0.2 for jet-in-cross flow [8] and 0.9 for free round jet [9]. Riddle et al. [10] reported reducing the Sc\nt from its \u2018\u2018standard value of 0.7\u2033 to 0.3 could improve the predicted ground level concentrations. From these studies, Sc\nt varies in value for different local flow properties, indicating its value should be performed based on the airflow structures. Shi et al. [11] proposed a new dynamic turbulent Schmidt number model based on local velocity gradient and density gradient, while their study focused on Sc\nt in the boundary layer. Mokhtarzadeh-Dehghan et al. [12] found Sc\nt should be associated with Richardson number in order to model the experimental spreading rates of heavier-than-air gases correctly in an atmospheric boundary layer. However, they didn't consider local flow properties based on the airflow structures.",

Some experimental studies were also conducted in aircraft cabins. Wang et al. [17] studied airborne contaminant transport using CO2 as a tracer gas inside an aircraft cabin. Sze To et al. [18] studied dispersion of expiratory droplets with mixing ventilation inside an aircraft cabin mockup. Zhang et al. [19] measured and predicted contaminant distributions in a cabin mockup. They used SF6 and mono-dispersed particles with diameter of 0.7 \u03bcm to simulate airborne contaminants. Li et al. [20] conducted an experiment for gaseous (SF6) and particulate (3 \u03bcm particle) contaminant dispersion in an actual functional MD-82 aircraft cabin. They stated that in narrow cabin space, source location and thermal buoyancy had a significant effect on airborne contaminant distributions. These research made a great contribution to understanding of contaminant transport in enclosed spaces, however, they did not analyze effect of different airflow structures on the Sc\nt value. Airflow in enclosed spaces is a kind of interaction of different flow structures, such as vorticity and deformation; therefore, the Sc\nt value should not be a constant number, but be varying based on airflow structures.",

The RNG k-\u03b5 model has been widely used for predicting indoor airflows with many successes [23]. The RSM turbulence model is more complex and more accurate with turbulent velocity fluctuations, but it needs more computing resource [24]. Martinho et al.

It should be noted that the data employed to develop the model were not used to validate the model. For the aircraft cabin, the data in the region <D> and <M> (Fig. 4) were used to improve the model, while all the data in CS3, CS4 and CS5 were used to validate the model. For the office room, the data in the two regions were used to develop the model, while all the data in poles P1-P5 were used to validate the model. Normalized concentrations for Source D from the simulation and experiment in CS3, CS4 and CS5 were plotted against each other in Fig. 7\n. The solid line represents perfect agreement, the dotted lines represent the region with errors ranging from \u221250% to 50%, and the error bars presented 95% confidence intervals. RRMSE and another index, correlation coefficient (r) were employed to quantify concentration data comparison. The correlation coefficient (r) [36] is defined as follows:(14)r=\u2211i=1n(Cexp,i\u2212Cexp\u00af)(Csim,i\u2212Csim\u00af)\u2211i=1n(Cexp,i\u2212Cexp\u00af)2\u00b7\u2211i=1n(Csim,i\u2212Csim\u00af)2where Cexp,iandCsim,i are experimental and simulated concentration at sampling point i. Cexp\u00afandCsim\u00af are averaging concentration of experiment and simulation. The correlation coefficient (r) describes the linear correlation of the experimental and predicted data. It ranges from \u22121 to 1, with \u22121 meaning strong negative relationship, 0 meaning no relationship and 1 meaning strong positive relationship. As shown in Fig. 7 and Table 2\n, for the aircraft cabin, the simulated result using the modified Sc\nt model was obviously better than that using the default Sc\nt, and it has a lower relative root mean square error and higher correlation coefficient.",

When comparing Table 1 with Table 2, it is found that the RRMSE of predicted velocity is smaller than that of concentration. This is because the species transport equation is solved based on momentum equations, and a little discrepancy for the simulated velocity fields will lead to large discrepancy for the predicted concentration distributions. Therefore, discrepancy for the simulated velocity fields may result in lack of improvement of the proposed procedure. Additionally, because pipe flow and air cabin flow significantly differed, application of the equation deduced from pipe flow may also result in some limited improvement. However the modified Sc\nt model was still better than that using the default Sc\nt, because the modified Sc\nt can compensate underestimation of turbulent diffusion in the RNG k-\u03b5 model to some extent.",

However, their study focused on flow and concentration fields on and around an isolated cubical building within the neutral turbulent boundary layer. Different with the turbulent core region in enclosed spaces, it is well known that, in the boundary layer, the turbulence is assumed to be anisotropic. In addition, some turbulence models, such as the v2-f model [38], were also proposed to predict anisotropic turbulence near the wall and solve overestimated turbulence fluctuation perpendicular to the wall.",

            "text": "\nFig. 9\nillustrated the modified Sc\nt equations and ranges of \u03bdt values for the selected different vortex structures in the aircraft cabin and office room. In these two spaces, most of the \u03bdt values fall within these ranges, but are not limited to these ranges. Because the equations of the modified Sc\nt are nonnegative and have specific physical meaning mentioned above, their effective ranges can cover all of the \u03bdt values in these two spaces. As shown in Fig. 9, equations of the modified Sc\nt are observably different for the aircraft cabin (Eq. (12)) and office room (Eq. (13)). We thought this may be caused by different airflow vibration frequencies. According to Prandtl's theory, vibration frequency is u'\u00af/l, where u'\u00af is mean fluctuation velocity, and l, per Shu's suggestion [39], should be the Kolmogorov scale as follows:(15)l=(\u03bd3\u03b5)14where \u03bd is kinetic viscosity, \u03b5 is turbulence eddy dissipation. As it is well expected that \u03b5 and u'\u00af is the highest at air inlet, where the vibration frequency should be also highest there, we use u'\u00afand\u03b5 at the inlet boundary to calculate vibration frequency. The inlet dissipation \u03b5 can be estimated as [26]:(16)\u03b5=c\u03bc34k32l'\n(17)k=32(u\u00afI)2where u\u00af is mean velocity, k is turbulence kinetic energy, I is turbulence intensity, l' is the turbulence length scale (m), equals to 0.07 d, d is the hydraulic diameter of the inlet plane and c\u03bc\u22480.09. For the aircraft cabin, mean velocity of its inlets is 1.87 m/s [28], and turbulence intensity is 40% [40]. For the room, mean velocity of its inlets is 0.76 m/s, and turbulence intensity is 10\u201315% [22]. Accordingly, vibration frequency of airflow in the aircraft cabin is 12678 Hz, while it is 92 Hz in the office room with an UFAD system. The remarkable difference of airflow frequency between the aircraft cabin and office room may lead to different modified Sc\nt expression functions. Higher frequency may result in stronger diffusion ability corresponding to a lower Sc\nt value, and the relationship between airflow vibration frequency and Schmidt number need further research. Nevertheless, the proposed modification method expressing Sc\nt values as a function of \u03bdt associated with vortex structures can improve contaminant concentration prediction in turbulent flow. For other researchers in the field, if the enclosed spaces which they investigated have similar airflow structures and frequencies with ours, they can refer to our new Schmidt number; otherwise they can still use our method to modify the turbulent Schmidt number for their research.",

This study was focused on gaseous pollutants, which are common in indoor environments. Three turbulence models were evaluated. The RNG k-\u03b5 model performed the best and was employed to modify Sc\nt. During the modification, different airflow vortex structures including deformation and vorticity were taken into consideration. Comparing with the experimental data, performance of the RNG k-\u03b5 model using modified Sc\nt was found to be better than that using default Sc\nt value in both the two enclosed spaces. For the aircraft cabin environment, the improved model reduced the relative root mean square error from 1.13 to 0.82, and increased the correlation coefficient from 0.32 to 0.65. For the office room with an UFAD system, the improved model reduced the relative root mean square error from 1.20 to 0.92, but no observable increase was found in correlation coefficient.
