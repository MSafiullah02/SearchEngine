International travel has facilitated the spread of COVID-19 throughout the world. As of March 13th, 2020, 118 countries, territories, and areas have reported COVID-19 cases, however, differences in patterns and intensity of transmission ranges were observed [2]. In February and early March in Korea, a sharp increase in the number of COVID-19 cases were observed, with most infections in specific clusters and geographical regions.",

With descriptive analysis of interim surveillance data, the data suggest that the patient outcome differed markedly between the geographic regions, highlighting the magnitude of surge of cases and access to hospitalization.

Triaging patients for hospitalization, social distancing (to reduce the number of contacts), and reporting the outbreak amongst vulnerable people in the population may have played a role in the recent decline in cases of COVID-19. However, in the initial response to COVID-19, quarantine, early detection, and isolation of suspected cases of COVID-19, may have contributed to lowering the wave of this epidemic in other parts of Korea. More severe cases were reported in the elderly with existing comorbidities, which warrants clear triage management and a high-risk approach in healthcare access prioritization.
