The epidemic in Italy started on January 30 and, following the spread of cases throughout the whole country, the Government declared the lockdown for several activities and a series of tight restrictions on March 13 to prevent the further worsening of the situation. As we write, in Italy we have not yet reached the peak of the contagion curve and more than 110,500 cases and 13,000 deaths have been registered.",

We want to endorse their comprehensive and honest description. It is remarkable the authors\u2019 aim of accurately describing the measures adopted by Italian IVF clinics to face this unprecedented situation to educate and provide guidance for those countries that must cope with it in the weeks ahead. Even though this emergency demands the precaution of postponing new treatments, each IVF center is also a tissue center; therefore, actions must be taken to preserve fertility in oncologic patients, but above all to ensure the proper maintenance of cryogenic banks.",

In the event that anyone in Group A (or B) comes into contact with an infected person, only Group A (or B) should be quarantined, therefore guaranteeing the possibility to continue the clinical activity.In accordance with what is established in the disaster plan, revise or implement novel emergency procedures and identify external equally skilled embryologists to replace the internal staff, in case all staff are quarantined.Minimize, if not even entirely prevent, contact with external personnel (clinicians, nurses, obstetricians, etc.).Avoid any contact with the patients and, if not avoidable, keep 1-m distance and use a proper face mask.Train the internal personnel (clinicians, nurses, etc.) how to refill the cryo-banks in order to safeguard the cryopreserved material in case of the lab staff being quarantined.In the absence of electronic witnessing systems, outline lean protocols to conduct the clinical procedures thereby minimizing the need for physical witnessing (e.g. external personnel properly equipped, telematic witnessing, etc.).Sanitize the environment, equipment and devices with appropriate detergents (solutions of quaternary ammonium) at the end of each procedure or after each access to the workplace.Plan an exceptional test of the alarm remote control system.",
