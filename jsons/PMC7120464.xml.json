Actinomycosis often occurs in patients with poor oral and dental hygiene. Lung involvement frequently includes fistulous involvement of pleural and chest wall soft tissues. Microscopically, the histologic findings are similar to those described in nocardiosis, but the organisms have a propensity to form larger macroscopic colonies in vivo that are identifiable in routinely stained sections as sulfur granules; these are indistinguishable from those seen more commonly in tonsils.\n\n",

Aspergillomas form in immunocompetent patients with underlying cavitary or cystic lung disease. ABPA affects patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis, and invasive forms of the disease occur in immunocompromised patients. Chronic cavitary aspergillosis is a progressive form of disease that has features intermediate between noninvasive and invasive forms of aspergillosis. It is characterized by radiologic progression and tends to occur in patients with underlying comorbidities, particularly chronic lung disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
