            "text": "The growing concentration of hazardous chemicals discharged from industries force the government organization to put a restriction on them to limit their discharge. Over a decade, the chromium (VI) is considered as significant contaminants causing health risks among living beings (Loryuenyong et al. 2014). The different source for the existence of hexavalent chromium includes leather tanning, chromate production, paint making and electroplating having discharge concentration ranging from 2000 to 5000 mg/mL but recommended permissible limit is only 2 mg/mL (Belay 2010). One solution to eradicate carcinogenic chromium (VI) is to convert into a non-toxic Cr (III) state, which is also an essential trace metal as human nutrition. The conventional chemical technique needs expensive reducing agents like ferrous sulfate, sodium hydrogen sulfite, sodium pyrosulfite and hydrazine hydrate. Also, they are harmful to living beings, human skin and release unwanted chemicals (Dhala et al. 2013). Table 1 lists the pros and cons of different conventional, existing and emergent techniques for removal of a pollutant from wastewater (Abdullah et al. 2019; Crini and Lichtfouse 2019; Burakov et al. 2018).",

            "text": "Recently, membrane separation has been widely used to treat wastewater. The low permeate flux with high operating pressure increases the cost in the case of reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF). Hence, ultrafiltration processes are preferred more as they work at low transmembrane pressures with lower operating costs. However, the use of membrane can only remove Cr (VI) ions from permeate and is acceptable according to environmental standards, but Cr (VI) concentration goes on increasing overtime at the retentate side and needs to be treated further before discharging to the environment. This problem intensifies more when the membrane recovery is below 50%. An alternative to the membrane separation technique is the use of highly efficient emergent technology (photocatalyst material) to treat wastewater in the presence of solar irradiation. The use of nanomaterial as photocatalyst is on demand due to its unique feature of having a high surface area to volume. However, the direct application of nanomaterial in suspended form for water treatments is inappropriate for recycling. From practical point of view, if the membrane surface is modified during synthesis procedure by incorporating photocatalyst material within the polymer matrix (Ramasundaram et al. 2016) to develop a hybrid material, coupling membrane separation and photocatalyst technology could present an integrated approach which not only eliminate Cr (VI) from wastewater but also reduce it to non-toxic Cr (III) form. Use of hybrid membrane (nanocomposite membrane), i.e., adding the highly photoactive nanomaterial (inorganic component) to the organic component led to their good performance. The use of nanocomposite membranes not only results in enhanced flux with high removal efficiency but also eliminates the fouling tendency of the membrane, increases the mechanical strength, thereby increasing the life span of membrane material (Nayak et al. 2016). At the same time, problem associated with poor recoverability of powdered material after treatment is also removed.",

However, being hydrophobic, the easy membrane fouling tendency affects the selective efficiency, and the chemical cleaning operations further increases its instability and deteriorates the sieving efficiency. The drawbacks can be eliminated by using different techniques including graft polymerization, chemical grafting, and surface coating membrane has been used to improve the surface hydrophilicity (Arif et al. 2019), but the weak interaction between polymer and additives affects the durability of the membrane (Salimi and Yousefi 2013). The incorporation of photocatalysis material into the polymer matrix is gaining interest. It is an effective approach to enhance membrane hydrophilicity, thereby improving the water flux and simultaneously antifouling and self-cleaning property (Mo et al. 2007). Among different types of nanoparticles existing, e.g., titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles (NPs) (Yang and Wang 2006), Al2O3 (Yan et al. 2009), carbon nanotubes (Brunet et al. 2011), ZnO (Zhang et al. 2014), nano-sized TiO2 is of high demand because of facile synthesis, excellent hydrophilicity and antibacterial property.",

            "text": "In this research, the effect of green route synthesized TiO2 loading on PVDF membrane efficacy was evaluated. The novelty of this study involves the first time use of an extract of Cajanus cajan (obtained easily from kitchen waste thus avoiding the use of a costly chemical reducing agent) to synthesize NPs. The synthesized particle will be used as a filler to enhance the property of polymeric membrane used for ultrafiltration application in terms of porosity, pore size, thermal stability, flux and separation efficiency. The presence of active substance terpenoids, aliphatic, and aromatic amines (active substance) in extract result in efficient stabilization and avoid agglomeration of NPs. Most of the literature reported the removal of Cr (VI) either using either a membrane or photocatalytic removal technique. Using a membrane as such leads to increases in Cr (VI) concentration on the retentate site; hence, further treatment is required to treat it before discarding, thus increasing the operation cost. In case of using photocatalyst material, the additional cost occurs because of difficulty in the recovery of photocatalyst material after the treatment. This study also includes the application of synthesized nanocomposite membrane to be used as bi-functional membrane for ultrafiltration application. The bi-functional membrane will not only reject but also reduce Cr (VI) leading to the potential recovery of non-toxic Cr (III) using same inorganic-polymer material and retaining its efficiency even after several runs, thus reducing the processing cost. Thus the membrane performance was defined in terms of chromium (VI) rejection and subsequently to retreat the concentrated chromium (VI) called retentate at the end of the filtration process to remove toxicity by reducing Cr (VI) to Cr (III) a non-toxic element.",

Thus, the antimicrobial activity of the synthesized PVDF/TiO2 membranes was studied and compared with pure PVDF to understand the effect of the addition of TiO2 NPs on the antifouling property of membranes. Two methods were reported in the literature to estimate the antibacterial activity: i) sterilization ratio calculation (Chong et al. 2017) and direct observation via FESEM (Chung et al. 2017). In this study, E. coli was used as the model foulant for the antimicrobial tests. Before the experiment, all the materials were autoclaved at 120 \u00b0C for 60 min to ensure sterility. E. coli was cultivated in a conical flask composed of 100 ml sterilized solution of nutrient broth kept in an incubator maintained at 37 \u00b0C for 1 day at 150 rpm to allow bacteria to grow fully. The overnight grown bacterial species were centrifuged for 15 min at 6000 rpm thrice to remove culture media and resuspended in sterilized DI water. UV-treated membrane pieces (0.01 m \u00d7 0.01 m) were taken and immersed in the cultivated E. coli suspension and placed in an incubator at 37 \u00b0C for 18 h. After that, the membranes were removed from the suspension, and 0.1 mL of the E. coli suspension was spread on an agar nutrient plate composed of 1.3 g of nutrient broth and 2.3 g of nutrient agar (NA) per 100 mL of distilled water and placed in the incubator for overnight.

The figure depicts that with increasing concentration of TiO2 there is a shift from the crystalline \u03b1 phase to \u03b2 phase, and maximum was achieved for PM3 membrane due to the incorporation of TiO2 NPs and also due to the interaction between polymer and inorganic filler (Vinoth et al. 2019) which is desirable because it has been reported in the literature that \u03b2 phase is considered as the thermodynamically stable form which results in the enhancement of toughness in nanocomposite materials (Lai et al. 2014).",

Figure 4a depicts that the membranes are thermally stable up to 300 \u00b0C and then degradation starts. The weight loss for the neat PVDF membrane (PM1) begins at 290 \u00b0C, and for PVDF/TiO2, it starts from 450 \u00b0C. It was also observed that the thermal stability of the PVDF/TiO2 is higher than the pure PVDF membrane and increases with an increase in the concentration of NPs. The significant weight loss was observed in the range from 400 to 500 \u00b0C which is assigned to the degradation of PVDF polymer. The weight loss decreases with an increase in TiO2 loading attributed to the interaction of TiO2 with the polymer matrix, and this interaction leads to delay in the diffusion of the volatile compound out of the polymer thereby enhancing the thermal decomposition temperature (defined as the temperature at 3\u20134% weight loss). Similar results were also reported in the literature (Shi et al.2013). For all nanocomposite membranes, a non-combustible residue that ensures the presence of the inorganic component (TiO2) was left behind.",

This increment is due to the excellent thermal property of TiO2 which will obstruct the decomposition of the polymer matrix by enhancing the rigidity in the PVDF chain. The interaction between the macromolecular chain of the polymer and TiO2 will restrain the state of PVDF chains, resulting in increases in the rigidity of polymer chains and restricting their thermal action; hence, the melting temperature of the composite membrane increases. The decreased value in the case of PM4 is due to agglomeration of a particle at high concentration reducing the surface-to-volume ratio; hence, contribution of interfacial effects will hinder the thermal characteristics (Nor et al. 2016).",

Similarly, De value for other PVDF/TiO2 membranes was calculated. It was well known that the composition of the casting solution strongly influences the kinetics of the membrane. At constant coagulation bath temperature, the solution viscosity increases with increasing concentration of TiO2; however, De value rises up to TiO2 loading 0.02 wt % and maximum value of 0.023 mm2 s\u22121 for PM3 membrane was achieved, and then, De value decreases on the further increase. The change in De with the TiO2 concentration was due to thermodynamic and rheological properties. The addition of TiO2 enhances the thermodynamic property due to an increased demixing rate. But at maximum loading (PM4-0.3 wt % TiO2), the increased viscosity creates a negative impact on De because of the increased viscosity slows down the exchange rate. Thus, it can be said that the rheological factor decreases De. Hence it can be concluded that the thermodynamic and the rheological factor show a trade-off relationship against one another. At low TiO2 concentration, the thermodynamic property becomes dominant, and at high concentration, rheological hindrance becomes prominent and influences the kinetics of membrane formation (Ya-nan et al. 2008). The trend of De and viscosity of PVDF/TiO2 hybrid membranes is shown in Fig. 6c.",

Figure 7a depicts that the observed contact angle of PVDF/TiO2 membranes is lower than the neat PVDF membrane. It is due to a high hydrophilic characteristic of TiO2 NPs. It was observed that the contact angle value declines from 94.9 to 77.2\u00b0 as TiO2 loadings increase from 0 to 0.3 wt %. Similar results were also reported by Arif et al. (2019). These results suggest that hydrophilicity is improved for the PVDF/TiO2 composite. The opposite trend to contact angle for porosity and pore size was observed (Fig. 7b, c). The porosity increases from approx. 74 to 85%, and the difference in porosity for PM1 and PM2 is more tangible compared to PM3 and PM4. It is due to a decrease in the rate of increasing porosity due to increased viscosity of the solution, which reduces the exchange of mass transfer rate between solvent and non-solvent, thus reducing the porosity and hence the pore size, with increasing inorganic TiO2 concentration. The results were supported by the kinetic study also. As already mentioned that inverse relationship exists between tortuosity and porosity. Figure 7d also shows a similar trend where tortuosity decreases with an increase in TiO2 loadings.",

            "text": "Figure 9a shows that with increasing TiO2 loading water, flux increases. It is due to the incorporation of hydrophilic TiO2 NPs and increased porosity, as shown in Fig. 7a, c also, but for the PM4 membrane, the flux declines due to decreased porosity attributed to delayed mixing rate with increased viscosity, which is also justified from the results shown in Fig. 6c. Figure 9b depicts the  % rejection for feed solution containing Cr (VI) for different membranes. It was observed that  % rejection was very less for pure PVDF membrane and increased with an increase in TiO2 loading, and nearly 85.59% chromium rejection was achieved. It is mentioned in various literature that separations are influenced by the presence of charge on the membrane, the concentration of solute, ionic interaction of inorganic filler with the membrane (Jyothi et al. 2017). Here the chromium removal is due to strong electrostatic interaction between TiO2 and Cr ions as Cr exists in its anionic form (Cr2O72\u2212,CrO42\u2212,and HCrO4\u2212), and amphoteric nature of TiO2 induces a positive charge (Ti-OH2+) on the membrane surface at acidic pH (6.1) (Jyothi et al. 2017; Kazemi et al. 2018). Hence, positively charged membrane will repel the cation and can adsorb the mentioned anions; hence, rejection occurs, which is not the case with pure PVDF membrane. The increased  % rejection with increasing loading is due to increased surface charge of on the membrane; also the presence of hydrophilic TiO2 NPs increases water flux but further increase in loading in case of PM4 membrane excess loading creates negative impact the on rejection percentage due to widening of pores (sponge-like pores) as mentioned in an earlier section and will also lower the flux due pore plugging and hinder diffusion (Jyothi et al. 2017).",

The  % reduction profile for the different membranes is shown in Fig. 9b; a maximum of 92% reduction was observed within 60 min at acidic pH (6.1) for the PM3 membrane. It is attributed to the generation of electrons into the interface of the polymer when illuminated with light leading to electron availability for Cr (VI) reduction. The electrons will be utilized by Cr (VI) to get reduced to Cr (III), where the acid environment will oxidize the hole produced in the valence band, thus avoiding the recombination possibility also (Jyothi et al. 2017). However, in the case of pure PVDF, the small change observed may be attributed to the adsorption phenomenon.",

The effect of different loading TiO2 results concludes that at optimal loading TiO2 (PM3- 0.02 wt %) maximum rejection of 85.59% and reduction 92% was achieved. The influence of TiO2 on membrane morphology was also studied by investigating the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. It was concluded that thermodynamic enhancement accelerated the phase separation with increasing TiO2 loading, thereby enhancing the porosity and water flux, but at maximum loading (PM4-0.03 wt %) the rheological hinderance becomes more prominent due to increased viscosity hence delaying the mixing rate and reducing the pore size formation; thus, there exists a trade-off relation between thermodynamic and kinetic parameter.",
