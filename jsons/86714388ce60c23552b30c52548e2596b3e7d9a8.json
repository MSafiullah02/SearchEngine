The commonest grouping is according to patient location at the time of acquisition of infection. Infections arising within a hospital setting may involve more drug-resistant pathogens compared to infections arising in the community. Within the grouping of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), further distinction is usually made according to whether the patient was on an intensive care unit, or intubated (ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP)) at the time of infection (Torres et al., 2017; Kalil et al., 2016) . A specific category of Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) was previously advocated as describing pneumonia developing outside a hospital setting that shared features of pathogenesis, causative pathogens and antibiotic resistance patterns with nosocomial (hospital-acquired) pneumonia. This category was never fully adopted internationally and the latest evidence does not support the continued use of this classification.",

These, and other microorganisms, are normally held in check by pulmonary host defenses. Disruption of these host defenses allow externally transposed pathogenic microorganisms to grow and displace the normal flora, or allow overgrowth of selected resident flora, leading to infection. There is growing interest in the role of antecedent viral respiratory tract infections as triggers for the disruption of the normal lung microbiome, providing an avenue for bacterial pathogens to take hold. The acute inflammation generated by the host immune response to infection results in an influx of inflammatory cells into the alveolar space, giving rise to the radiological pattern of consolidation (Fig. 2) . In most cases, the predominant inflammatory cell involved reflects the inciting pathogen; neutrophils in bacterial infections, lymphocytes in viral infections and granulomatous inflammation in Mycobacterial and fungal infections. The systemic cytokine response gives rise to many of the characteristic features of infection, such as fever, myalgia and a rise in C-reactive protein levels.",

A wide array of microbiological tests is available (Table 3) . However, even with the use of modern molecular-based microbiological investigations (e.g., PCR, antigen detection tests) in patients with CAP, a pathogen is identified in only 50-75% of cases (Jain et al., 2015) . In routine care where microbiology testing is still based mainly around cultural techniques (e.g., from blood and respiratory tract samples), a pathogen may be identified in only 5-10% of cases. Conversely, in patients with suspected VAP, extensive colonization of airways creates difficulties in the interpretation of positive microbiology results. The use of highly sensitive PCR techniques can compound the difficulty. Similar challenges confront the management of immunocompromised patients. In these instances, careful attention to the coherence of microbiology test results with the clinico-radiological pattern is necessary to distinguish colonization from infection. Sometimes, a diagnosis of pneumonia can only be confirmed or refuted following review of the subsequent clinical course of illness, including the clinical response to empirically initiated antimicrobial agents.",

Because LRTIs can be caused by a range of pathogens, singlepathogen specific technologies are less helpful.

A meta-analysis of individual participant data from 26 RCTs found that PCT-directed treatment in the management of acute respiratory tract infections (of varying types and severity, including CAP and HAP) was associated with a reduction in antibiotic exposure (5.0 vs. 7.0 days) composed of a decrease in both (a) the proportions initiating antibiotics and (b) the duration of antibiotics (6.0 vs. 8.0 days), as well as a reduction in 30-day mortality (8.6% vs. 10.0%) (Schuetz et al., 2017) .",

Severity assessment guides decisions around (a) place of treatment (whether in the community, in hospital, or in intensive care), (b) depth of investigations, (c) speed of treatment and (d) type of treatment, including the choice of antimicrobial agents and route of administration. Various severity assessment tools have been developed for the management of patients presenting with CAP. The two most widely validated and adopted tools are the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) and the CURB65 score. Both of these were developed to predict shortterm, 30-day mortality in patients presenting to hospital with CAP. Prognostic tools to predict ICU admission are not as widely used partly due to differences in ICU admission policies influencing the predictive accuracy of tools developed in one healthcare system and applied to a different healthcare system. Severity assessment tools for HAP are less well validated. This reflects the much broader diversity of factors influencing prognosis in patients with HAP, including type of hospital ward, reason for hospital admission, time from hospital admission, medical interventions, exposure to nosocomial pathogens and preceding antibiotic exposure. Similarly, there are no pneumonia-specific tools for assessing severity in immunocompromised patients. In these patients, the degree of immune compromise is often the dominating factor in severity assessment. Patients who are severely immunocompromised may lack many of the symptoms or signs associated with severe illness. A high degree of vigilance is therefore important. ",

In addition, and perhaps more importantly, is the development of newer conjugated vaccines and high-dose vaccines that promote stronger immune responses in older at-risk persons compared to previous \"standard\" influenza vaccines, hence offering greater protection. Influenza vaccines that are not strain-specific (so-called \"universal\" vaccines) and therefore less subject to mismatch are also being developed as are vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus.",

Efforts at reducing the burden of disease through vaccination have been rewarded with some success but continued innovation is required to maintain gains made so far. The rise of antimicrobial resistance threatens our ability to treat infections that occur, urging a more judicious approach than the empirical antimicrobial strategies that characterize much of current clinical practice. The future expectation is a shift towards targeted treatments supported by rapid diagnostics, thus enabling the use of non-antibiotic pathogen-specific therapies (such as anti-toxins) and promising the eradiation of inappropriate antimicrobial use. Immune-modulating agents may offer further benefits in relation to short-term recovery, and improved post-pneumonia care could translate into better longer-term outcomes.",
