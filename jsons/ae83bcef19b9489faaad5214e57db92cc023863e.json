The calculated lower and upper bound of patients (deaths) till 10 th June 2020 comes out to be 79496 (3835) and 241759 (7045), respectively. States like Delhi, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu are the spike states as suggested by the range of expected COVID-19 patients and deaths. Impact of return of stranded pilgrims from Nanded (Maharashtra) has also been looked into in the case of Punjab. It has been found that Punjab may see ~ 5 times increase in the lower bound of expected patients till 10 th June 2020 due to the return of pilgrims from Maharashtra. Our study provides an insight into the possible number of expected patients and deaths in near future that may be of importance for the respective governments to be ready with the appropriate preventive measures and logistics to put appropriate infrastructure and medical facilities in place to manage the spread of deadly virus and go down the flattening curve.",

So far due to this pandemic, the number of patients have risen to 4088848 and the death count risen to 283153 (mortality rate ~ 6.9%) [2] . The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March 2020 by looking at its spread and threat to human life on the earth [3] . In India, the first case of COVID-19 was recorded on 30 January 2020 in Kerala, after that the number of cases rose to 69307 and death count rose to 2282 till 12 th May 2020. It has been confirmed that COVID-19 transmits from person to person through touching, coughing, sneezing [4] , therefore, social distancing, isolation, and self-quarantine of suspected and infected patients are a must to avoid its spread. To control its transmission, lockdowns and curfews are implemented in various countries. In India the lockdown was implemented by the Government of India in the early stages of this pandemic in a country that restricted its fast exponential growth as has happened in China, USA, Italy, Spain, etc. [5] [6] . However, the lockdowns and curfews are not the permanent solution of this pandemic and cannot be implemented for longer periods of time especially for a country like India, because of huge economic cost impacting vulnerable sections of the society, daily wage earners and large migrant labor. Beyond Lockdowns, every individual has to take his/her responsibility to maintain social distancing, use masks in public, avoid social gatherings, and avoid unnecessary movements to control its spread in the near future until its vaccine is discovered.",

This is the reason behind the exponential rise in cases of this pandemic worldwide despite the measures that have been taken to prevent its spread on war footing. The forecast of this pandemic based on the real-time data provides a way to help the governments and the concerned authorities to make the policies to minimize the infection of COVID-19 and halt it at the earliest with the participation of public at large. By anticipating the expected growth of patients, it is likely that governments provide required interventions such as COVID-19 health facilities, quarantine centers to screen suspected persons, dedicated COVID hospitals for infected cases and chalk out strategies to let the economic activities continue.",
