However, previous studies suggested that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted within family and hospital-associated populations,3\n,\n11\n,\n12 indicating that this virus spreads mainly through close contact and infected respiratory droplets rather than through aerosols. In our study, the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in any of the 44 air samples, indicating that the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by aerosols is yet to be confirmed. An air sampler that could force larger volumes of air should be required to detect low concentrations of the virus in the clinical environment in further studies.13 Conversely, in the designated hospitals for COVID-19, strict measures for air purification had been taken. The most important measure was to open windows to promote ventilation. If mobility could increase air exchange and reduce the virus concentration, then the probability of infection is greatly reduced.14\n,\n15 Previous studies have shown that ultraviolet light could kill the coronavirus effectively.16 For rooms with poor ventilation in the designated hospital, an ultraviolet air disinfection machine with 24-h ultraviolet disinfection filtration was devoted to sterilize the air.",

Current guidelines suggest gloves, gowns, respirators, and eye protectors as PPE during COVID-19 patient care. There is also need for more careful and comprehensive procedures for putting on and removing PPE.20 In addition, the basic environmental hygiene and disinfection measures should be put in place.21 The environmental cleaning and disinfection regimes during the COVID-19 epidemic were similar in all areas: surface cleaning and disinfection using chlorine-based disinfectants were conducted twice per day. There were some limitations in the process of environmental disinfection in the designated hospital. First, environmental surface disinfection was implemented by spraying a chlorine-containing disinfectant. However, spraying cannot cover the surface evenly, such as the corners, and the effect of disinfection cannot be guaranteed without the wiping process. Moreover, spraying disinfectants may lead to harms to patients and health-care workers, thus spraying disinfection should not be recommended. Second, the cleaning work in the designated hospital was mostly done by volunteer cleaners during this special period. They received the necessary training without professional experience. Third, all samples were collected under emergency conditions around 8:00 am before routine cleaning and disinfection. The result may indicate that the usual frequency of disinfection did not meet the demand.",
