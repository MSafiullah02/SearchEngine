Most studies that evaluate risk factors of mortality due to pneumonia are from developing countries with limited resources for prevention and therapeutic measures. Young age, the presence of certain underlying medical conditions, as well as dyspnea, hypoxemia, and lower hemoglobin concentrations, were reported to be associated with mortality. Neither specific pathogens nor laboratory data seem to correlate with mortality. [10] [11] [12] [13] A study from Paraguay used an adult severity score (PIRO scale) for pneumonia in children which accurately predicted the probability of mortality in children who presented to the hospital with CAP. 14 A handful of studies have developed or modified other severity scores such as the Respiratory Index of Severity in Children (RISC) 10 and the modified Wood's clinical asthma score for pneumonia. 15 In addition, several guidelines also include recommendations and severity parameters, some of which are used to predict admission to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). 16, 17 In the US, respiratory rate, temperature, altered mental status, heart rate, age, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio were the most important individual predictors of severity. 18 However, there are still no universally accepted severity scores for pneumonia in children, and similar scores have neither been validated nor developed for children in the developed world, where advanced monitoring and therapeutic modalities are available in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) setting.",

The population in the region is composed of two ethnic groups: the Jewish population, generally comparable to a Western population, and the Bedouin population, in transition from semi-nomadism to settlement, generally comparable to a low socioeconomic status population. In 2011, 36,200 children under five years old were Bedouins, and 35,800 were Jewish. Social contacts between these groups are limited, especially between children. Hospitalization rates for respiratory infectious diseases and especially for CAAP are higher among the Bedouin population. 19, 21, 22 This study was approved by the institutional and national Ethics Committees and was All children <5 years visiting the Soroka University Medical Center ED with radiologicallyproven CAAP were included. Children hospitalized in the PICU (PICU-CAAP) were compared with two groups: 1) children treated in the ED and subsequently discharged (ED-CAAP); and 2) children who were hospitalized in the general pediatric wards (Hosp-CAAP).",

In the present study also, younger age and underlying medical conditions (e.g., congenital heart defects, chronic lung disease, and prematurity) and signs of respiratory distress and tachypnea characterized children with CAAP who were hospitalized in the PICU. This is possibly related to the predisposition of younger children, mainly those who were born prematurely, to acquire a more severe disease.

First, although, nasal pharyngeal aspirate is a procedure that is general protocol in the pediatric department for all children, viral samples were not taken from all patients (especially those who were admitted on weekends or holidays) and usually not from those discharged from the ED. However, since the study included relatively large numbers of CAAP episodes where nasal washes were obtained, the results can still be valid. Second, the study included data mainly from the pre-pneumococcal conjugated vaccine era and only the first year after the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was included in the national immunization program. Thus, similar studies should be repeated after PCV implementation. 31 Another limitation was that the bacteriological survey was limited to isolates from blood. However, this limitation is not unique to this study and is also inherent as a limitation in other studies. Even though numbers of positive isolates were relatively low (an underestimation), higher bacteremia and pneumococcal events were still found to be higher in PICU-CAAP children when compared to the other groups.",

Overall, respiratory viruses were detected significantly more often in nasopharyngeal PICU-CAAP (61.2%) than ED-CAAP (24.3%).

Regarding other viruses, human metapneumovirus (HMPV) was significantly less prevalent in the PICU-CAAP (1.0% vs. 5.6% in the Hosp-CAAP and 6.7% in the ED-CAAP), whereas parainfluenza was detected in 7.0% of the PICU-CAAP vs. 4.3% in the Hosp-CAAP and 1.9% in the ED-CAAP, although the differences were not statistically significant.",

Data from developed countries regarding the characteristics of children hospitalized in PICU because of CAAP are scarce. Other than the PIRO scale, 14 no severity scores have been developed and validated in the developed world. Araya et al showed that the use of the PIRO scale was accurate in predicting mortality in children with CAP. Variables associated with mortality were the presence of apyrexia, tachypnea, leukopenia, pleural effusion, renal injury, acidosis, hypotension, and change in consciousness.",
