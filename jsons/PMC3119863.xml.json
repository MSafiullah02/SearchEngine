            "text": "Viral infections affect wheezing and asthma in children and adults of all ages. In infancy, wheezing illnesses are usually viral in origin, and children with more severe wheezing episodes are more likely to develop recurrent episodes of asthma and to develop asthma later in childhood. The etiology of the viral infection affects the long\u2010term prognosis, and preschool children who wheeze with human rhinoviruses (HRV) are particularly likely to subsequently develop asthma. The other major risk factor for asthma in this age group is the early onset of sensitization to respiratory allergies. In older children and adults, most viral respiratory illnesses are relatively mild and yet contribute to acute and potentially severe exacerbations in patients with asthma. In fact, there is considerable evidence that viral respiratory infections and respiratory allergies are the two most significant risk factors for exacerbations leading to acute care visits or hospitalization. These findings underline the importance of understanding the synergistic nature of allergic sensitization and infections with HRV in infants relative to the onset of asthma and in children and adults with respect to exacerbations of asthma. In this article, we review clinical evidence of virus\u2013allergen interactions and discuss experimental evidence and theories relating immunologic responses to respiratory viruses and allergic airway inflammation to the pathogenesis and disease activity of asthma.",

Data from studies using molecular diagnostics in the US (1, 2, 3, 4), Australia (5, 6), Asia (7, 8), and Europe (9) demonstrate that there are at least 60 more HRV strains than had been previously appreciated (10). Analysis of full genome sequences of these newly identified HRV indicates that the majority belong to a unique species now designated HRV\u2010C (11). Like several other newly discovered respiratory viruses, HRV\u2010C do not grow in standard tissue culture, and this characteristic explains why their discovery required the development of molecular diagnostics.",

The viral capsid is composed of four proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3, VP4) that assemble into protomers, and each capsid contains 60 protomers. Variations in the structure of these proteins (particularly VP1 and VP2) accounts for the large number of viral serotypes and strains. The capsid binds to specific proteins on the surface of airway cells. Of the 99 HRV serotypes, 84 bind to intercellular adhesion molecule\u20101 (ICAM\u20101) and the others bind to members of the low\u2010density lipoprotein receptor. Analysis of a limited number of genomes suggested that HRV\u2010C probably binds to unique cellular receptors (11). Recently, HRV\u2010C have been grown in vitro by culturing sinus mucosal biopsy specimens in organ culture, and this system was used to demonstrate that HRV\u2010C viruses bind to receptors that are distinct from those used by other HRV (12).",

The HRV polymerase directs RNA replication, and both single\u2010 and double\u2010stranded viral RNA are present in the cell during this process.

For example, the 2A protease cleaves eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma (eIF4G) in the ribosomal protein complex; this prevents the translation of capped RNA (the majority of cellular mRNA). In contrast, the HRV genome has an RNA structure known as the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) which binds to the ribosomal complex independently of eIF4G, and so translation of HRV RNA is unimpeded. The 2A protease also cleaves nuclear pore proteins which impedes communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm. One consequence of these activities is that cellular RNA levels may not reflect protein synthesis. HRV infection also inhibits transcription of cellular RNA but not viral RNA. Like many other viruses, there is evidence that HRV has developed mechanisms to inhibit antiviral responses by cleaving proteins such as RIG\u2010I and IPS\u20101 that are involved in virus recognition pathways (13, 14), and transcription factors related to the antiviral and chemokine responses (e.g. OCT\u20101) (15).",

Transmission of HRV infections between adults generally requires prolonged contact (16, 17); infants and young children are the most effective vectors and readily transmit HRV infections within families (18). Respiratory symptoms typically develop after 1\u20132 days in inoculation studies. Early signs of a cold include sore or scratchy throat and malaise, followed by a thin mucoid discharge, sneezing, congestion, and thicker nasal secretions with increased mucus during the peak of the cold. Uncomplicated HRV infections usually peak 2\u20134 days after inoculation and are resolving by 1 week after inoculation. Infections that last 2 weeks or longer or those that seem to be improving and then worsen again represent either serial infections with different cold viruses (19) or else a secondary bacterial infection following an initial viral infection. HRV infections are often detected in asymptomatic infants and less commonly in adults. Viral detection without symptoms can represent the beginning or end of an infection or true asymptomatic infection.

HRV\u2010C viruses have been closely associated with wheezing illnesses in infants and pneumonia in young children in a number of clinical studies (1, 5, 8, 20, 21). In addition, HRV\u2010C viruses are frequently detected during exacerbations of asthma in children, and there is some evidence that HRV\u2010C can cause more severe wheezing episodes compared to HRV\u2010A and \u2010B (1, 22). HRV epidemiology is complex: up to 20 strains of HRV circulate through a community during a single season, and the prevailing HRV strains differ according to season and location, and shift almost completely from year to year (23). The complexity of HRV epidemiology and the large number of HRV strains indicate that long\u2010term population\u2010based studies will be required to determine whether HRV\u2010C are indeed more virulent than other HRV strains.",

Virus\u2010induced damage to the epithelium can disturb airway physiology through a number of different pathways. For example, epithelial edema and shedding together with mucus production can cause airway obstruction and wheezing. Furthermore, HRV infections can inhibit processes associated with epithelial repair (24). In addition, viral replication initiates innate immune responses within the epithelial cell including induction of interferons (IFNs), antiviral effectors, and chemokines that recruit inflammatory cells into the airway (25, 26, 27, 28, 29). The recent development of rodent models of infection with HRV and related picornaviruses will provide systems to test theories about immunopathogenesis in vivo (30, 31, 32).

The majority of the cells recruited to the airway during acute colds are neutrophils, with smaller numbers of mononuclear cells and in some studies, eosinophils. Products of neutrophil activation are likely involved in obstructing the airways and causing lower airway symptoms. For example, the release of the potent secretagogue elastase from activated neutrophils can upregulate goblet cell secretion of mucus (35). In addition, changes in neutrophils in nasal secretions have been related to respiratory symptoms and virus\u2010induced increases in airway hyperresponsiveness (enhanced bronchoconstriction in response to irritants), a key feature of asthma (36, 37). These findings suggest that one strategy to reduce the severity of viral illnesses might be to moderate neutrophilic inflammatory responses. Moreover, mononuclear cells are recruited into the upper and lower airway during the early stages of a viral respiratory infection, and serve to limit the extent of infection and to clear virus\u2010infected epithelial cells. This is consistent with reports of severe viral lower respiratory infections in immunocompromised patients (38).",

Interestingly, boys are more likely to develop moderate to severe HRV illnesses during early childhood (39). There has been considerable interest in defining the relationship between patterns of antiviral responses and illness outcomes, especially IFNs and factors related to atopy and asthma. These relationships are discussed in detail later in the review. Finally, environmental and lifestyle factors associated with more severe common colds include pollutants, smoking, characteristics of the immune responses, stress, and diet.

The more severe end of the illness spectrum is known as bronchiolitis and includes many clinical features of acute asthma, including wheezing, rapid breathing, and sometimes hypoxia and hypoventilation. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is particularly likely to cause lower respiratory tract infection, and accounts for about half of the cases of bronchiolitis in the winter months. Interestingly, although some respiratory viruses are more or less likely to cause severe illnesses, the clinical manifestations of infection (rhinitis, cough, and in some cases wheeze) are pretty similar.

            "text": "Recent studies using molecular diagnostics have demonstrated that HRV are common causes of lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children. This recognition of HRV as a lower airway pathogen is a departure from its original characterization as a virus that exclusively causes the common cold. Soon after its discovery in 1956, HRV was found to replicate best at relatively cool temperatures (33\u201335 \u00b0C), and so it was assumed that infections were limited to the upper airway. Although lung parenchyma is at core temperature (37 \u00b0C), airways are considerably cooler, and temperatures in large and medium sized airways are ideal for HRV replication (44). In fact, HRV has been detected in lower airway fluids and cells and after experimental infection of the upper airway (45, 46, 47). Furthermore, there is considerable clinical evidence linking HRV infections to lower respiratory infections in children, including those who are hospitalized for pneumonia (48, 49, 50, 51). A recent year\u2010long population\u2010based study of children <5 years of age found that HRV was detected in 26% of children hospitalized for respiratory symptoms or fever (49). HRV\u2010related hospitalization rates were especially high for infants, and children with asthma. These findings suggest the possibility that infections with HRV, like RSV and other respiratory viruses, can directly injure airway tissues during the acute infection. One feature that distinguishes HRV from other respiratory viruses is the large number of distinct strains, including 100 traditional serotypes, and an estimated 60 HRV\u2010C species viruses that are grouped by genotype (10). As a result, HRV infections occur frequently in young children, and children prone to wheezing with respiratory viruses can experience recurrent episodes of wheezing with distinct HRV strains.",

            "text": "About a third of infants who have an acute wheezing illness go on to develop recurrent wheezing, leading to the speculation that viral respiratory illnesses in early life promote asthma. A causal role for viruses in asthma seems plausible because the lungs and the immune system are growing and developing during infancy, and might be especially vulnerable to pathogens during this period of time (52). Alternatively, it is also possible that the relationship is not causal, and that virus\u2010induced wheezing episodes instead reveal a preexisting tendency for asthma secondary to impaired lung physiology or antiviral responses. In fact, immunologic and lung\u2010specific risk factors for more severe viral respiratory illnesses have been identified and are discussed in detail later in this chapter. This theory suggests that some children are either born with or soon acquire abnormal lung physiology, and then infection with a respiratory virus, such as HRV, presents the first noxious stimulus to provoke wheezing. A third possibility, which combines elements of the first two, is a \u2018two hit hypothesis\u2019 in which viral infections promote asthma mainly in predisposed children (53, 54). For example, infants who are predisposed to have poor antiviral responses would develop more severe illness during infections with respiratory viruses. These more severe infections could lead to increased damage of the lower airways during a particularly important growth phase of the lungs. According to this hypothesis, recurrent lower respiratory infections could hinder proper lung growth and development, leading to changes in airway structure (e.g. fibrosis) that promote asthma.",

            "text": "This line of reasoning is supported by experimental findings that infections with viruses such as RSV and HRV in vivo and in vitro increase the synthesis of factors that can influence lung growth, development and repair (27, 52, 55, 56, 57, 58). The pathophysiology of asthma is closely related to airway remodeling, a collection of features that reflect structural changes in the airway that promote acute and chronic airway obstruction. These structural changes include hypertrophy of airway smooth muscle, increased fibrosis, reduced barrier function, increased number of mucus\u2010secreting cells and proliferation of airway vasculature within the epithelium (59). These changes in airway structure are not present in most wheezing infants but appear to develop in childhood (60, 61). In addition, acute infections with HRV or other viruses can induce the synthesis of factors that regulate airway growth, angiogenesis, fibrosis, and repair (\nTable 3\n). Furthermore, viral infections can upregulate neurotropins that regulate the development of the airway neural network (62). This effect on neural mechanisms could affect bronchoconstrictive responses to non\u2010specific irritants, including future viral infections. In fact, increased sensitivity to inhaled irritants (a.k.a. bronchial hyperresponsiveness) is a key feature of asthma. How single or repeated bouts of virus\u2010induced overexpression of these regulators of lung development and remodeling affects the ultimate lung structure and function is not known, but is of interest regarding the long\u2010term effects of viral infection on lung function and asthma. These questions may be best addressed in animal models, and models to study effects of HRV infections in the mouse have been published (30, 31), as well as methods for serial passage of mouse epithelial cells for propagation of HRV (63). In addition, mengovirus, another member of the Picornaviridae family, is a natural rodent pathogen that causes systemic infections that resemble poliovirus. This virus has been attenuated to replicate, but not kill, epithelial cells, and when inoculated into the airway, replicates for several days and causes a mild respiratory illness that resembles HRV infection in the human (32).",

This risk is further increased by a family history of asthma, the development of allergic diseases such as allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis, blood eosinophilia, and male gender (54).

Several studies suggest that infants who wheeze with HRV may have an especially high risk for subsequent asthma. For example, a case control study conducted in Finland demonstrated that infants hospitalized with HRV\u2010induced wheezing were found to have a particularly high risk for subsequent asthma, and this relationship persisted at least through adolescence (69, 70). This finding is further supported by the results of two birth cohort studies. The Childhood Origins of Asthma (COAST) study is a high\u2010risk birth cohort study in which families with at least one parent with allergies or asthma were enrolled prenatally, and both immune development and respiratory illnesses were prospectively evaluated (53). Through the use of PCR\u2010based diagnostics, viral etiologies were identified in 90% of wheezing illnesses. Notably, moderate to severe HRV infections (with and without wheezing) during infancy were a significant risk factor (odds ratio = 10) for persistent wheezing at age 3 years (71). Moreover, HRV wheezing illnesses in the first 3 years of life were significantly associated with the development of asthma at age 6 years (72). The combination of allergic sensitization and HRV\u2010induced wheezing by age 3 years was associated with the highest risk of developing asthma. Similarly, in an Australian birth cohort study, Kusel and colleagues (73) enrolled 198 babies and compared viral respiratory illnesses in the first year of life to subsequent respiratory outcomes. Wheezing illnesses with either HRV or RSV in infancy were associated with asthma at age 5 years. Interestingly, these associations were only significant in the children with early onset (by age 2 years) allergic sensitization. Collectively, these results highlight the role of virus\u2010induced wheezing in infancy, and HRV in particular, in determining the risk for subsequent asthma.",

In most instances, exacerbations are caused by multiple factors. Accordingly, HRV inoculation of volunteers with stable asthma does not usually provoke acute asthma symptoms (80, 81). Other factors that commonly contribute to exacerbations of asthma are allergy, allergen exposure, indoor pollutants (e.g. tobacco smoke, NO2), outdoor pollutants (e.g. particulates, ozone), stress, and other infections (e.g. sinusitis). In addition, lack of use of an asthma control medication for persistent asthma is associated with increased risk of exacerbation. Some of these factors are also associated with increased severity of colds in the absence of asthma (\nTable 1\n), suggesting the possibility that they may enhance viral replication or amplify the effects of virus\u2010induced inflammation.",

Children who had HRV infection detected in combination with either eosinophilia or a positive radioallergosorbent test (RAST) to common aeroallergens had the strongest odds of wheezing (82, 83). In addition, a recent study performed routine sampling of nasal secretions in children with asthma during periods of peak HRV prevalence, and approximately two\u2010thirds of these children also were sensitized to respiratory allergens (23).

Similar findings were reported in a case\u2010control study of adults; the combination of sensitization, high exposure to one or more indoor allergens, and viral detection considerably increased the risk of being admitted to the hospital with asthma (odds ratio 8.4, 95% confidence interval 2.1 to 32.8; P = 0.002) (85).

In addition to provoking acute exacerbations of asthma, HRV infections can also increase lower airway obstruction in individuals with other chronic airway diseases such as chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis (87). Whether allergy also plays a role in exacerbations of these disorders has not been determined. Traditionally, it has been observed that viral URI or LRI commonly precede bacterial infections, and mechanisms for viral infections to promote secondary bacterial infections have been described. More recently, the converse mechanism has received a lot of attention: can bacterial infections (or colonization) increase susceptibility to viral respiratory infection and illness? Interestingly, individuals with COPD require very small amounts of virus to induce moderate colds after experimental inoculation (88). Moreover, new genomic techniques have disproved the longstanding assumption that the lower airway is sterile, and two recent studies indicate that there are unique features of lower airway flora in asthma (89, 90). Finally, colonization of the upper airway with bacterial pathogens in the first 3 months of life has been related to virus\u2010induced wheeze and increased risk for subsequent asthma (91). Collectively, these findings suggest that viruses and bacteria may interact in determining the risk for onset of asthma, and in the causation of acute exacerbations in children and adults with established disease.",

It has been demonstrated that other cells may become infected during viral infections.

In tissue culture, HRV appear to replicate at least as well or perhaps even better in epithelial cells derived from either upper versus lower airway (106, 107). In addition, HRV has been detected in lower airway cells and secretions by RT\u2010PCR, in situ hybridization, and immunostaining of mucosal biopsies after experimental inoculation (45, 46, 47). Following experimental inoculation, about one\u2010third of adults have levels of virus detected in sputum that are equal to or exceed virus detected in nasal secretions, whether or not asthma is present.

Considering that little\u2010to\u2010no replication of HRV has been observed in airway macrophages or blood monocytes (129, 145), the signaling pathways are likely to vary considerably from epithelial cell signaling, which is thought to rely heavily on viral replication. Compared to the elaborate signaling mechanisms that have been elucidated in epithelial cells, signaling in monocytic cells has not been extensively explored, and have been exclusively performed with major group HRV (see \nFig. 2B). We have observed that CCL2 protein release from primary monocytic cells is linked to the activation of the transcription factor NF\u2010\u03baB and phosphorylation of the transcription ATF\u20102 (146). NF\u2010\u03baB activation, but not the p38 MAPK, has been reported to be involved in HRV\u2010mediated TNF\u2010\u03b1 release by monocytic cells (145). Furthermore, HRV16 induces a significant increase in IFN\u2010\u03b1 release and STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation in human monocytes, and neutralization of the type I IFN receptor or inhibition of JAK or p38 MAPK activity strongly attenuates HRV16\u2010stimulated STAT1 phosphorylation and CXCL10 release (28).

In addition to the release of IFNs, epithelial cells produce a large array of cytokines, chemokines, and other inflammatory mediators to induce the influx of leukocytes and cause respiratory inflammation. To facilitate HRV\u2010mediated signaling, the expression of certain signaling molecules and transcription factors from epithelial cells is induced in response to HRV. Additionally, exposure of epithelial cells to HRV also induces the release of growth factors, which can serve to prolong the life of infiltrating leukocytes, and may contribute to airway remodeling seen in the lungs of asthmatics.

Furthermore, exposure of leukocytes to HRV also modulates the expression of surface adhesion receptors, which alters leukocyte migration (150, 151, 152, 153). Concentrations of CCL2, a chemotactic factor for monocytes, T lymphocytes, and basophils are markedly elevated in BALF from asthmatic individuals compared to BALF from control individuals (154). Moreover, levels of the cytokine CXCL10, a chemotactic factor for CXCR3+ cells such as NK cells and T lymphocytes, have been associated with HRV\u2010induced pathology in asthmatics (97, 155). Interestingly, we have observed that monocytic cells (i.e. peripheral blood monocytes and BALF macrophages) are able to robustly release CCL2 and CXCL10 upon HRV\u201016 treatment (28, 146), supporting the notion that these phagocytes are a source of these chemokines during a natural cold. In an atopic asthma model, experimental HRV inoculation of BALF macrophages induces the expression of mediators (i.e. Arginase\u20101, Ym\u20101, Mgl2) that are indicative of a less inflammatory, more fibrotic, macrophage population, supporting a more Th\u20102 dominant environment (113).",

The close proximity of epithelial cells and macrophages in vivo suggests that intercellular interactions between these two cell types would likely enhance antiviral responses to HRV infection. In support of this hypothesis, HRV\u2010mediated VEGF induction from bronchial epithelial cells is enhanced in the presence of HRV\u2010treated mononuclear cell supernatants (158). Furthermore, co\u2010culture of human monocytic and bronchial epithelial cells promoted a synergistic augmentation of CXCL10 and CCL2 protein release following HRV16 challenge (159). Transfer of conditioned media from HRV16\u2010treated monocytic cells to epithelial cultures induced robust CXCL10 release by the epithelial cells, which was attenuated by type IFN receptor blocking antibodies and could be recapitulated by IFN\u03b1 addition.

The use of BEC is highly relevant as these cells are the primary site for a HRV infection in the lower airway. Using this model, Wark et al. (148) found HRV\u201016 replication was increased and IFN\u2010\u03b2 responses were diminished in BEC from asthmatic patients. The addition of IFN\u2010\u03b2 to the HRV BEC cultures from asthmatic subjects reduced virus replication. Paralleling these observations with IFN\u2010\u03b2, Contoli et al.

This concept could also apply to pollutants, and explain why exposure to toxic agents (e.g. tobacco smoke, NO2) also increases the risk of viral wheeze (171, 172).

Recent mechanistic studies have provided evidence of antagonistic relationships between allergic inflammation and antiviral immunity (174, 175).

DCs can also play a key role in allergic sensitization, by directing the development of naive T cells into Th1 versus Th2 cells; the latter secrete cytokines that lead to IgE production (i.e. IL\u20104, IL\u201013) and eosinophilic inflammation (e.g., IL\u20105). Thymic stromal lymphopoeitin (TSLP) is an epithelial\u2010derived cytokine that acts on DCs to promote Th2 differentiation (176), and this cytokine can be induced by HRV infection through a TLR3\u2010dependent mechanism (177). Furthermore, TLR\u20103\u2010induced secretion of TSLP is enhanced by IL\u20104, suggesting that virus infection in allergic airways could intensify Th2 inflammatory responses (177). Interestingly, TSLP and IFN\u2010\u03b2 responses in epithelial cells may be reciprocally regulated (178, 179), suggesting that high levels of TSLP in the airways could potentially impair antiviral responses. Finally, allergic inflammation and viral infections synergistically enhance mucus secretion in mice (180); excess secretion of mucus can lead to plugging and closure of the airways in asthma.",
