For this review, an international Epi-Aid was defined as one that occurred in countries or territories other than the United States and Puerto Rico. An Epi-Aid that occurred in multiple countries or locations but was linked to a single etiology was counted as a single investigation and was attributed to the location where the problem was first identified. We excluded investigations linked to travelers returning ill to the United States from a foreign country or cruise ships because the investigation began in the United States and not the foreign country.",

An EISO investigated a cancer cluster; however, the results were inconclusive (CDC, unpublished data, 1966). In 1971, an outbreak of rubella in Bermuda investigated by EISOs ended 19 days after a vaccination campaign was implemented (23). Before 1971, the island had not conducted any mass campaigns for rubella vaccine (23). Investigation of the Lassa fever outbreak in Sierra Leone was notable because fewer deaths occurred than in previous outbreaks in Nigeria and Liberia; a proportion of the population apparently had evidence of prior infection with Lassa fever virus (24). During this investigation, both nosocomial transmission and person-to-person transmission occurred among families.

A nurse was implicated in the deaths, but the cause of the epidemic was inconclusive. This investigation demonstrated the link between forensic science and epidemiology. The return of an American tourist to the United States from Cancun, Mexico, with cholera resulted in an Epi-Aid examining whether cholera was a problem in the community where the tourist had stayed during vacation (30). Testing revealed non-01 Vibrio cholerae isolated from 22 samples of 134 stool and rectal swabs, 92% of sewage samples (58/63), 86% of untreated well-water samples (12/14), 1 home storage tank, and 21% of raw seafood samples (5/24).

One bakery closed immediately after persons became ill, which led investigators to test the flour and other items and to confirm parathion contamination. One key recommendation based on this investigation is that countries establish laws to regulate the shipment and use of such toxic pesticides as parathion.

An additional Ebola outbreak occurred in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1995 (42). Injections were not identified as a major risk factor for transmission, as was the case in the 1976 outbreak. Instead, transmission was primarily associated with person-to-person contact. Of note, this was the fourth major outbreak of Ebola documented and the first to occur in a large population center. Recommendations arising from this investigation again called for use of personal protective equipment by health care workers, development and implementation of improved surveillance for infectious diseases, better communication between hospitals and public health officials, and quick action to control diseases associated with high case-fatality rates (42).",

Cardiovascular disease now accounts for approximately 30% of deaths in low- and middle-income countries each year and is accompanied by critical economic repercussions. Building public health infrastructure and health systems with the capacity to implement programs to address cardiovascular disease and other chronic disease risk will be required. These programs should consist of evidence-based prevention strategies, including behavior modification and health policy interventions developed for chronic diseases (e.g., heart disease, diabetes, and obesity) and unhealthy behaviors (e.g., smoking) (58).",

In addition, we might have underestimated the number of international investigations conducted by EISOs because field investigations and requests for technical assistance can be processed through means other than the Epi-Aid mechanism used for acute responses. Although we might not have captured all of the international activities performed by EISOs during the 60-year period, this review clearly demonstrates the depth and breadth of their response efforts globally.",

Since 1980, approximately 40 countries, with support from CDC, have established Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETPs) and FELTPs (59); all were modeled on CDC\u2019s EIS Program (60, 61). Figure 1 indicates that FETPs have developed in each region in which Epi-Aids have been conducted. FETPs/FELTPs help to improve global public health capacity by developing a trained cadre of public health professionals in low- and medium-income countries. Similar to the EIS Program, FETPs and FELTPs provide training in core public health competencies, including epidemiology, biostatistics, public health surveillance, laboratory practice, communication, computer technology, management and leadership, and prevention effectiveness (62\u201364). CDC continues to provide financial support and technical assistance to 18 programs in 34 countries (includes regional programs) with FETPs and FELTPs (59). Six other countries (Zimbabwe, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Brazil, and Egypt) were once supported by CDC but now have self-sustaining programs managed by the host country (59). FETPs also exist in developed countries (e.g., Australia, Canada, Germany, and Spain).",
