Pooled, cell-free supernatant from respiratory samples was examined using a random polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Amplified PCR products were separated, ligated to a vector, and introduced into Escherichia coli. Clones were sequenced and evaluated through an automated protocol and compared against known sequences. The majority of the clones were determined to be human or recognized bacterial and viral pathogens. Of the remaining sequences, a parvoviruslike sequence was identified with no known correlation to recognized human parvoviruses. Phylogenetic analysis showed this to be a novel parvovirus most closely related to bovine parvovirus and canine minute virus (Fig. 1\n). It is now named the human bocavirus.",

The resulting amplicons were subcloned into a plasmid vector, sequenced, and compared with genome entries on GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis of HBoV-2 shows that it is most closely related to HBoV-1. The amino acid identity of HBoV-2 to HBoV-1 is 78%, 67%, and 80% for the NS1, NP1, and VP1/VP2 proteins, respectively. There is significant divergence of the genomic targets used for detection of HBoV-1, which explains why HBoV-2 has remained unidentified to this point.",

Similar to the methods used in discovery of HBoV-1 and HBoV-2, Arthur and colleagues13 digested filtered fecal samples with nucleases, then pelleted virions and evaluated using degenerate oligonucleotide primed\u2013PCR. During these investigations, the group simultaneously discovered HBoV-2 and a third species of bocavirus, HBoV-3. Analysis of the genome shows close homology to HBoV-1 in the nonstructural protein encoding regions (NS1, NP1), but HBoV-3 is more similar to HBoV-2 in the structural protein encoding regions (VP1/VP2). This finding suggests that HBoV3 may be the product of recombination between HBoV1 and HBoV2. Arthur and colleagues identified a recombination site that supports this hypothesis. As with HBov-2, the HBoV-3 genome is divergent enough from HBoV-1 to explain lack of detection using currently published primer sets (Table 1\n). Clinical presentation, seasonal distribution, and prevalence of HBoV3 have yet to be characterized in full. Further analysis of the phylogenetic relationships will be required to determine the correct taxonomy of this virus family.",

Parvoviruses are single-stranded DNA viruses with a small genome size between 4 kilobases (kb) and 6 kb that have three open reading frames that encode two nonstructural proteins, NS1 and NP1, and the structural VP1 and VP2 proteins. The HBoV genome does not encode a polymerase and depends on host cell DNA polymerases for replication. Parvoviruses have unenveloped capsids with icosahedral symmetry.16 Based on electron micrographs, HBoV-1 appears structurally similar to other members of the Parvoviridae family and is approximately 25 nm in diameter.17\n",

This region, referred to as the VP1 unique region, plays a critical role in virus infectivity in some parvoviruses.18 In several parvoviruses, VP3 arises from posttranslational proteolytic cleavage of VP2 proteins. It remains unclear if VP3 exists in human bocavirus. The capsid of parvoviruses consists of about 60 copies of each viral capsid protein. The role of NS1 and NP1 proteins in human bocavirus species remain unknown. Zhi and colleagues19 created an infectious clone of the related parvovirus B19 to determine the functions of these genes. Their findings showed that NS and VP1 knockout mutants abolished the viral infectivity. The NS protein also seemed to be vital in genome transcription and to play a role in the regulation of capsid gene expression.",

To answer this several studies have compared the presence of HBoV-1 in asymptomatic control groups to symptomatic individuals.34, 35, 36, 37 All but one found HBoV-1 more often in symptomatic children than in healthy controls. In the remaining study, asymptomatic carriage of HBoV-1 was as frequent in asymptomatic infants as those who had acute respiratory tract disease. In a recent report by Allander and colleagues15 HBoV-1 DNA is also present in the serum of acutely ill patients suggesting that dissemination of this virus is possible. These findings provide support for HBoV-1 as a cause for respiratory illness. When in vitro culture systems and animal models are available, a better understanding of the role of HBoV-1 in human respiratory disease can be established.",

The presence of HBoV-1 failed to achieve statistical significance, supporting the hypothesis that HBoV-1 may not be a cause of acute gastroenteritis.13 The authors note that the lack of HBoV-1 in symptomatic individuals may be because symptoms may appear before viral particles are shed in stool. Similar findings were made for astrovirus and adenovirus, which are widely accepted causes of gastroenteritis.13 Also, HBoV-2 was significantly found more often in patients with gastroenteritis. Because of the low incidence in this study, the clinical significance of HBoV-3 remains unclear. Further data on higher viral load in stool samples corresponding with active disease would support causality.",
