Despite this, there are currently no approved vaccines and no parasite-specific drugs to treat the disease in either humans or livestock in the US. The only Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for treating cryptosporidiosis in humans is nitazoxanide [4]. However, the efficacy of nitazoxanide against Cryptosporidium in immunocompetent humans is marginal and the drug has no treatment benefit against the parasite in AIDS patients [5\u20137]. The clear need for more effective parasite-specific drugs has increased the need for refined, reliable animal models of cryptosporidiosis for therapeutic efficacy evaluation.",

            "text": "Neonatal calves can provide an excellent acute clinical model for both human and bovine cryptosporidiosis. During the 10\u201314-day-old age period most often used, neonatal calves are functional monogastrics and remain so up to 4 weeks of age [8, 9]. Clinical symptoms and diarrhea severity and duration following experimental infection in calves closely mirror what is observed in humans [8, 10]. Further, the anatomic distribution of infection in the GI tract and lesions are essentially the same as those observed in humans [8, 10]. Given these observations supporting the validity of calves as a useful clinical model most closely approximating human cryptosporidiosis, multiple methodologies and experimental designs for evaluation of therapeutics in the model have been published. The most commonly used calf models differ mainly in (1) frequency of fecal collection, (2) type of calf housing used (elevated stalls, or box stalls/pens), (3) whether total daily fecal volume excreted is collected, or a ~10\u201315 mL fecal sample is obtained per rectum once or twice daily, (4) methods used for determining diarrhea severity (quantitative or semi-quantitative), (5) methods used for evaluating oocyst shedding (quantitative, e.g., qPCR or hemocytometer enumeration of the total number of oocysts shed in total daily fecal collections, or various semi-quantitative measures, e.g., acid-fast stain or immunofluorescence assay on fecal sample smears and microscopic scoring, or qPCR on fecal samples collected every 12\u201324 h), (6) trial duration and (7) C. parvum isolate used (field vs characterized) [11\u201316]. Total daily fecal collection is required to unequivocally determine diarrhea severity and total number of oocysts produced and requires housing in elevated stalls [11\u201313]; these measurements are not possible with box stall or pen housing in which a ~10\u201315 mL fecal sample is collected daily per rectum [14\u201316]. Model designs vary between investigator and institutional factors (e.g., housing facilities and equipment availability, investigator preferences, staffing resources and abilities, budgetary constraints) and can influence the accuracy of results for efficacy parameters. Therefore, the experimental design used in a particular calf model study should be considered when interpreting efficacy results of a given therapeutic and when making comparisons between studies. For example, in one calf model of cryptosporidiosis, treating calves with nitazoxanide reduced the duration of C. parvum oocyst shedding and diarrhea severity [14], while in another calf model, nitazoxanide had no therapeutic or prophylactic efficacy against clinical disease caused by C. parvum, and in some C. parvum-infected calves nitazoxanide treatment actually prolonged and exacerbated diarrhea [15]. In a calf model similar to the preceding, paromomycin demonstrated prophylactic efficacy against C. parvum challenge and proof of concept, but the drug dosage required was determined to be cost prohibitive for veterinary use [16]. While there is no universally applicable design for the calf model given geographic, institutional, and laboratory constraints, we have used the acute model described here to consistently replicate data demonstrating therapeutic efficacy for multiple bumped kinase inhibitor (BKI) drugs for further study, as well as to consistently replicate data demonstrating lower, clinically less satisfactory efficacy for other BKIs to eliminate from further study [11, 17] (M.W. Riggs and D.A. Schaefer, unpublished).",

            "text": "The model described here is quite labor-intensive and demanding on personnel compared to some other calf models for evaluation of therapeutics and requires housing calves in elevated stalls for total fecal collection. However, the increased labor and demands are justified because the method yields the most accurate efficacy data using defined, quantitative outcome parameters. Determining total daily fecal volume and consistency for each calf provides an objective and unequivocal direct measure of diarrhea severity. Total daily fecal collection is also the preferred practice in human challenge studies to evaluate the efficacy of candidate anti-cryptosporidial preparations [18]. In addition, total daily fecal collection allows accurate determination of total number of oocysts produced per day as an unequivocal measure of treatment effect on parasite replication, and also avoids potential error resulting from diurnal variations in oocyst shedding we have observed in this model [11] (see\nNote\n1). Reduction of oocyst shedding is an important treatment outcome when considering the epidemiologic importance of the environmental parasite burden and exposure risk to both humans and livestock [19]. By 8 or 9 days post infection (DPI), most untreated control calves are beginning to resolve diarrhea in this model [11, 17]. Therefore, we end the experiment at 10 DPI to conclude initial efficacy determinations.",

This allowed individual calves to be housed in larger box stalls. However, fecal collection bags invariably leaked or became detached and failed completely, despite emptying up to three times daily. Emptying the bags also required manual restraint of calves and resulted in visible distress. Given all of the above, housing of calves in elevated stalls in this acute model design is thus scientifically and ethically justified and is approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The method presented here is completed in the following major sequential steps or procedures to evaluate therapeutics in this calf model of cryptosporidiosis: (1) procure isolated Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and age-matched (within 12 h) newborn pathogen-free Holstein bull calves for therapeutic efficacy evaluation, (2) manage husbandry of calves housed in elevated stalls, modified to accurately evaluate clinical health parameters, diarrhea severity, parasite production and urine production, (3) infect calves with C. parvum at 36\u201348 h of age and administer candidate therapeutic agents per the appropriate dosage and treatment regimen commencing at 2 DPI, (4) collect and process feces to determine total daily fecal volumes and total daily oocyst counts, (5) complete terminal procedures and euthanize calves at 10 DPI, and (6) analyze data for significant treatment effects on clinical health, total fecal volume (diarrhea severity), total oocysts produced (parasite replication), total urine volume (an additional index of hydration), and body weight gain or loss.",

            "text": "\nDecide on the C. parvum isolate to be used and obtain purified oocysts from a source production laboratory. We routinely use the Iowa C. parvum isolate [23, 24] because it is well characterized and is maintained by monthly propagation in newborn Cryptosporidium-free Holstein bull calves in our laboratory [25, 26] (Cryptosporidium Production Laboratory; https://acbs.cals.arizona.edu/crypto). Other established laboratories and commercial sources exist for obtaining purified C. parvum oocysts in the numbers required for calf trials including Bunch Grass Farm (Deary, ID; bunchgrassfarm@gmail.com). Alternatively, use the method described here to propagate C. parvum oocysts in calves and isolate oocysts from feces using published methods. Store oocysts in the saline/antibiotic solution the source laboratory ships them in (4 \u00b0C) for up to 60 days, but ideally use oocysts within 30 days of isolation for calf infection. All procedures involving C. parvum must be performed at Biosafety Level-2 (BSL-2) in an approved BSL-2 laboratory.Immediately prior to administration to calves, disinfect oocysts with 0.5% peracetic acid (4 \u00b0C) to inactivate any possible contaminant bacterial or viral pathogens [23, 27] (see\nNote\n2). Peracetic acid is the preferred disinfectant as treatment of oocysts with diluted sodium hypochlorite (bleach) has been shown to promote spontaneous excystation at 37 \u00b0C [25, 27]. Use of hypochlorite-disinfected oocysts could potentially result in excystation in the abomasum of experimental calves and sporozoite killing by acidic conditions, effectively reducing the intended infectious dose [25]. In contrast, peracetic acid disinfection does not promote spontaneous excystation. All disinfection steps are performed at 4 \u00b0C. Centrifuge oocysts previously stored in saline/antibiotic solution (8000 \u00d7 g, 7 min, 4 \u00b0C), remove saline/antibiotic solution, resuspend the oocyst pellet in PBS (4 \u00b0C) and wash oocysts with PBS twice. Then resuspend the pelleted oocysts thoroughly in 1\u201310 mL 0.5% peracetic acid (stock peracetic acid diluted in DI water to 0.5% vol/vol). Incubate resuspended oocysts at 4 \u00b0C for 3 min, inverting once each min. The 3 min timing period starts immediately upon addition of peracetic acid. After 3 min treatment, immediately pellet oocysts (8000 \u00d7 g, 7 min, 4 \u00b0C), remove peracetic acid and wash 4\u00d7 with PBS as described above. Keep oocysts at 4 \u00b0C at all times post-peracetic acid treatment until immediately prior to inoculation of calves.Following disinfection, determine percent oocyst excystation as a viability index and adjust the challenge dose if necessary (see\nNote\n3). To determine percent excystation, resuspend a disinfected oocyst aliquot (~106 oocysts) in 250 \u03bcL excystation medium (1.5% taurocholic acid, 0.5% trypsin in PBS, pH 7.2\u20137.4) and place in a shaking water bath (1.5 h, 37 \u00b0C). At the end of the incubation, count the number of intact unexcysted oocysts and oocyst shells (fully/partially excysted oocysts) using a hemocytometer and phase microscopy. Divide the number of oocyst shells by the total number of oocyst shells plus intact oocysts and multiply by 100 to determine % excystation. Excystation is typically >95% for oocysts stored properly for up to 30 days following isolation and disinfection.\n",

            "text": "\nTrained veterinary staff obtain age-matched (born within a 12 h period) Holstein bull calves from a closed herd USDA-licensed dairy production unit, preferably the same source unit for all studies. Cohort size will vary depending on the investigator\u2019s facility capacity for ABSL-2 calf isolation and source dairy average daily calving numbers. The minimum cohort size desired is six calves (three treated, three control) (see\nNote\n4). With two such cohorts completed, data for six treated and six control calves are obtained, allowing potential exclusion of up to one calf per group without compromising statistical analyses in most cases. Occasionally such exclusions are required because of inadvertent coinfection with one or more other enteropathogens, need for euthanasia because of disease severity before completion of the study or other confounding variables. Trained laboratory staff manually assist birthing of calves for delivery onto a 10 mil plastic sheet barrier to minimize possible exposure to other enteropathogens or Cryptosporidium isolates or species (see\nNote\n5). Because newborn calves are wet and difficult to securely hold, use clean thick cotton terrycloth towels to grasp calves during delivery. Calves from cows which experience dystocia or prolonged calving, or twin calves are not accepted. Weigh and perform a physical exam on each calf, including careful examination for congenital anomalies such as imperforate anus, cleft palate, and limb abnormalities. Calves weighing \u226538 kg and having normal physical exam findings are the most suitable for use in the method described here; calves weighing <38 kg are excluded (see\nNote\n6). Place acceptable calves into a previously disinfected wheelbarrow for transport to a pre-disinfected designated concrete area. Disinfect the wheelbarrow between use for each calf. Wash any body parts, especially the muzzle and head region, with 7% iodine scrub and warm water if necessary to remove any exogenous material, then dry with a clean towel. Clean both sides of one ear with 7% iodine scrub and rinse, then apply a numbered ear tag to enrolled calves to serve as the calf\u2019s identifying number. Record date and time of birth. Dip the navel in 10% iodine solution (not scrub), again after colostrum replacer is fed, again on arrival at the ABSL-2 facility and again 24 h after arrival. Orally administer to each calf Ecolizer (Clostridium perfringens Type C antitoxin and anti-Escherichia coli antibody, Novartis, Larchwood, IA) and CalfGuard vaccine (attenuated bovine rotavirus and coronavirus, Zoetis, Kalamazoo, MI) within 20 min of birth, and 1 h prior to feeding colostrum replacer per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Commencing 1 h after administration of the preceding antibodies and vaccine, feed enrolled calves commercial colostrum replacer from a single lot by nipple bottle (see\nNote\n7), continuing until 6 h after birth at twice the manufacturer\u2019s recommended calf dose reconstituted in 2 L of water (see\nNotes\n8 and 9). Record actual time and volume of colostrum replacer intake hourly to confirm optimal full dosing is achieved within 6 h after birth. If a calf will not voluntarily consume the full amount of colostrum replacer within 6 h of birth, attempt to nipple bottle-feed the remainder within 9 h of birth (see\nNote\n10). If a calf will not voluntarily consume the full amount of colostrum replacer within 9 h of birth, carefully feed the remainder using an esophageal tube feeder [28] (see\nNote\n11).Place calves into disinfected transport crates (crates for 90\u2013125 pound dogs) with autoclaved straw bedding for transport by cargo van to ABSL-2 Facilities. Disinfect calf rooms and allow them to air dry for at least 3 days prior to and after each experiment to inactivate any residual Cryptosporidium or other microbial agents. Upon arrival, assign calves to either treatment or control groups using a randomization method such as Microsoft Excel Random Number Generation Tool, then place calves into individual elevated calf stalls (Wenke Manufacturing, Pender, NE), equipped with coated slat flooring material (9 gauge flat expanded metal with rubberized coating and diamond-shaped openings) (see\nNote\n12). House treatment and control groups in separate ABSL-2 rooms. Facilities will vary between institutions but we house two to three calves per room (~3 m wide by ~5 m long), allowing placement of elevated stalls such that the calves face each other for environmental enrichment but at distances that do not allow direct contact between calves. In instances when only a single calf is housed per room, place a mirror at eye level on the wall in front of the calf for environmental enrichment.Using a nipple bottle, feed calves non-medicated milk replacer (crude protein ~22% [bovine whey and milk-derived], crude fat ~20%) twice daily commencing at 12 h of age (volume equivalent to 10% of birth weight total per day divided into 2 feedings, 12 h apart through 5 days of age, increased by 25% at 6 days of age and increased again by 25% at 8 days of age) until the end of the experiment at 10 DPI (see\nNote\n13). Allow 25\u201330 min per feeding for calves to consume the entire volume of milk replacer. Record the actual quantity of milk replacer consumed at each feeding. If a calf does not voluntarily consume any milk replacer, carefully feed the calculated volume of replacer using an esophageal tube feeder [28] (see\nNote\n14). Clean and disinfect all nipple bottles, buckets, and utensils used for replacer reconstitution and feeding after each use.At 24 h of age administer vitamin E/selenium supplement (3 mL/45 kg) subcutaneously. Collect a blood sample by venipuncture (~10 mL), isolate the serum fraction, and test serum to verify adequate passive transfer of colostral IgG using a rapid method such as serum refractometry to semi-quantitatively assess serum IgG levels [29, 30] (see\nNote\n15).At 36 h of age, perform another physical examination on each calf prior to final clearance and admittance into the study. Remove any unhealthy calves from the study (exclusion criteria: fever >103.0 \u00b0F, diarrhea, respiratory distress, inappetence, or inability to rise on own). Prior to experimental infection, examine fecal smears from each calf for the potential presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) [31]. Remove any calves from the study that are positive for inadvertent field acquired Cryptosporidium infection.\n",

            "text": "\nChoose an optimal time for personnel to infect calves such that at the time of inoculation no calves in the cohort are younger than 36 h of age and no calves are older than 48 h of age. Following acclimation, at the chosen time between 36 and 48 h of age (defined as DPI 0), orally administer disinfected oocysts (see Subheading 3.1) to calves as follows. While the calf is standing, allow each calf to suckle milk replacer (250 mL) from a nipple bottle to close the esophageal (gastric) groove and thus bypass the rumen for delivery of the inoculum directly into the abomasum [28]. Immediately thereafter, orally administer to each calf 5 \u00d7 107 viable, peracetic acid-disinfected C. parvum oocysts previously enumerated using a hemocytometer and prepared as follows. Prior to use, keep the oocyst inoculum for each calf in ~5 mL PBS at 4 \u00b0C in a 15-mL centrifuge tube. Immediately prior to inoculation, allow the inoculum to gradually reach room temperature over a ~10 min period to avoid thermal shock, then vortex the tube to resuspend oocysts. Immediately draw up the inoculum into a 50 cc blunt-ended catheter tip dosing syringe, equipped with a 15 cm Nalgene tube (~2 mm inside diameter) to facilitate recovery of the entire inoculum. Rinse/vortex the oocyst tube once with 5 mL PBS and draw up the rinse into the same 50 cc syringe. Finally, draw up ~20 mL milk replacer (at room temperature) into the syringe and mix by inversion immediately prior to calf inoculation. For clarity, this is the final inoculum for one calf. For each additional calf, the inoculum is identically prepared using a new disposable dosing syringe. Administer the inoculum immediately following the closure of the esophageal (gastric) groove as described above by orally inserting the dosing syringe so that the tip is at the base of the tongue, while the calf is still in the suckling response. With the head elevated to optimize the delivery of the entire inoculum, allow natural suckling of the syringe contents, facilitated by gradual manual expulsion. Administer the inoculum at a rate that does not allow any dripping from the calf\u2019s mouth (see\nNote\n16). Reload the syringe once with ~25 mL milk replacer as a rinse and repeat the administration procedure. Immediately thereafter, feed each calf the calculated volume of milk replacer to meet daily dietary requirements as described above (Subheading 3.2, step 3) and to ensure that the full inoculum reaches the abomasum. Examine fecal samples for oocysts by IFA daily following infection to determine pre-patent and patent periods.Initial administration of a given therapeutic candidate begins on DPI 2, at which time untreated C. parvum infection is established and nearing completion of one round of the life cycle at the infection dose used [19]. The candidate therapeutic must be prepared according to the institution\u2019s Standard Operating Procedures for Preparation of Compounds for Use in Animals and be approved by the IACUC prior to administration. The dosage and frequency of dosing for most candidate therapeutics in the calf model can be initially based on mg/kg extrapolation from the most efficacious dosage regimens identified in C. parvum-infected mice, allometric modeling in mice and rats, and ultimately pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic studies in uninfected and infected newborn calves [11]. Preliminary Pharmacokinetics/Absorption-Distribution-Metabolism-Elimination studies may be performed on treated calves in a given trial to evaluate a candidate therapeutic, if additional stress can be minimized, and control (vehicle only) calves are identically sampled. Of potential relevance to desirable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of candidate chemotherapeutics, it was recently shown that intestinal (vs systemic) exposure is essential for the efficacy of bumped kinase inhibitor drugs against C. parvum in mouse models [32]. Treat control calves identically for the regimen selected with vehicle alone. Code by label the therapeutic (in vehicle) being evaluated, and vehicle alone, to blind the treatment and control preparations. Just prior to each treatment, allow each calf to suckle milk replacer (~475 mL) from a nipple bottle to close the esophageal (gastric) groove. Then feed each calf by nipple bottle the candidate therapeutic in vehicle, or vehicle alone, mixed well with milk replacer in a final volume of ~475 mL. Following each treatment, feed each calf the calculated volume of milk replacer to meet daily dietary requirements as described above (Subheading 3.2, step 3). Record all treatments with the therapeutic or vehicle alone. Make potable water available to all calves by bucket ad libitum for the entire experiment. At the earliest onset of diarrhea, make an oral electrolyte solution available to each calf by bucket for the remainder of the experiment. At each feeding, record the quantity of water and oral electrolytes consumed from buckets since the previous feeding, clean both buckets, and fill each with fresh water or electrolytes.\n",

            "text": "\nOnce the study has commenced, collect diarrheic fecal samples from each calf (~30 mL/calf) and have them examined for the presence of enteropathogenic bacteria (K99+ E. coli, Clostridium spp. and Salmonella spp.). Perform these tests on fecal samples collected after two consecutive episodes of diarrhea. Immediately remove from the study and exclude from analyses any calves found positive for other enteropathogens which would confound interpretation of the experimental results. Collect additional fecal samples from all calves at the completion of the experiment and reexamine for presence of the enteropathogens above. Exclude any positive calves from analyses (see\nNote\n20).Commencing 3 DPI, for the duration of the experiment, have trained veterinary clinical staff assess clinical health parameters on each calf twice daily (every 12 h) and assign an objective numerical score for each parameter. Blind personnel involved in the study as to the identity (treatment or control) of calves (single-blind study). Assign and record individual scores to each calf for (1) fecal consistency, (2) willingness to rise, (3) stance when up in stall, (4) appetite, (5) attitude, and (6) hydration status [11, 12, 33] (see\nNote\n21). Determine the mean daily clinical health score using individual parameter scores for each calf. Determine rectal temperature once daily. Contact the attending veterinarian on call if any of the following are observed: (1) pain and/or distress (grinding teeth, grunting, kicking at abdomen, abnormal vocalizations), (2) severe watery profuse diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, (3) moderate or severe dehydration, (4) high fever (>103.5 \u00b0F) or hypothermia (<96 \u00b0F), (5) weight loss exceeding 10%, (6) depressed mental state, minimally responsive or otherwise appearing in extremis, (7) inability to stand, or (8) inability to suckle. In such cases, the attending veterinarian makes all decisions on appropriate supportive treatment(s) or whether euthanasia is required. Treat fever (\u2265103.5 \u00b0F) and/or symptoms of pain with palliative therapy such as injectable flunixin meglumine under direction of the attending veterinarian (see\nNote\n22). Treat moderate dehydration at its very earliest onset with parenteral rehydration under direction of the attending veterinarian to prevent progression to severe dehydration (Table 1). Record the use of any concomitant medications and parenteral fluid therapy in the records for each calf.As an additional index of hydration status, measure total daily urine output by each calf 3\u201310 DPI. Based on estimated volume in the urine collection bin for each calf, pour all urine into the appropriate size graduated cylinder to determine the actual volume of both AM and PM collections separately. Combine the volumes to determine the total daily urine volume for each calf and record the values. Disinfect and rinse the urine collection bin, then dry and place the bin back under the stall, positioned as previously.On 3\u201310 DPI, measure and evaluate total daily fecal volume (mL) and consistency for each calf to accurately determine diarrhea severity and oocyst numbers produced daily (see\nNote\n23). When caring for calves at AM and PM time points, complete fecal collection and assessment of clinical health parameters prior to feeding (see\nNote\n24). Calves typically rise and stand prior to feeding, which facilitates fecal collection and clinical assessment (see\nNote\n25). Measure the total daily fecal volume (combined AM and PM collections) just prior to the PM feeding as described in Subheading 3.6. Thoroughly clean and mop calf room floors with quaternary ammonium-based disinfectant after procedures are completed each AM and PM.Accurately quantify the total number of oocysts shed per day (3\u201310 DPI) from each calf as follows. Using a commercial grade blender, thoroughly blend the total daily fecal collection from each calf to homogeneity and to ensure the release of oocysts trapped in any clumps of excess mucus (detailed in Subheading 3.6, step 3). Once homogenized, collect a 50 mL sample, representative of the total volume, and store at 4 \u00b0C for oocyst quantitation as described below (Subheading 3.8). Transport fecal samples from the ABSL-2 facility to the BSL-2 laboratory for analyses in a closed container labeled with a biohazard sticker.\n\n",

Blend on the low speed setting for 5 min with the blender lid locked on securely. Place the blender on the floor undisturbed for ~5 min before unlocking and removing the lid to reduce aerosol risks. If the total daily fecal volume for any calf is near or greater than the 4 L blender capacity, split the volume in two and blend each separately as described above. After blending, then thoroughly mix the two using two 4 L size buckets and pouring back and forth at least five times. Immediately following completion of blending/mixing steps, collect a representative ~50 mL fecal sample from the mid-point of the container using a ladle, and place the sample into a fecal specimen container (urinalysis cup) pre-labeled with date and calf #. The blending and mixing processes create aerosols. Take extreme precautions to avoid zoonotic infection.Wash the blender thoroughly with hot water and dish detergent followed by disinfection and rinse well between processing feces from each calf.\n",

Add InhibitEx buffer, incubate at 95 \u00b0C (5 min), then perform 5 freeze-thaw cycles. Quantify total DNA in the sample by Nanodrop\u00ae ( Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE).

            "text": "\nDiurnal variations were observed in ten neonatal Holstein bull calves we used previously for oocyst propagation/isolation, obtained, maintained, and housed as described above and identically infected with 5 \u00d7 107\nC. parvum oocysts (Iowa) at 36\u201348 h of age [11]. In these propagation calves, total AM and total PM feces excreted by each calf were collected separately each day, to prioritize and exclude any potential low count collections from laborious oocyst purification procedures. Using the oocyst quantitation methods described in Subheading 3, but before we adopted the use of a blender to homogenize feces, we observed that oocyst counts per gram of feces in AM and PM collections from an individual calf could vary by ten-fold or more on some days, up to 46-fold in one calf (Fig. 2a, b). We also observed grossly that calves produced highly variable amounts of mucus in feces. We observed microscopically that large numbers (wall to wall sheets) of oocysts were entrapped in mucus in such cases, while more watery fecal components were often only sparsely populated with oocysts. Whether the observed oocyst count variations in AM vs PM collections represent true diurnal variation or skewing of oocyst counts by entrapment of oocysts in fecal mucus produced by some calves is unclear. Nevertheless, based on these observations, we have since used uniformly blended total daily fecal collections (AM and PM combined) to obtain a representative sample for accurate oocyst quantitation. An industrial grade blender is used to ensure that oocysts trapped in clumps of mucus are released and that daily fecal collections from each calf are thoroughly blended to homogeneity before taking a representative sample for oocyst quantitation (# oocysts/mL) and back calculation using total fecal volume (mL) to determine the total number of oocysts shed per day. Peracetic acid is highly toxic and explosive. Follow all precautions stated in the MSDS.Use % excystation to adjust the number of oocysts in the inoculum to deliver 5 \u00d7 107 viable oocysts/calf. For example, if percent excystation is 94%, adjust the oocyst inoculum dose/calf from 5 \u00d7 107 to 5.3 \u00d7 107.Occasionally, the desired number of age-matched calves for a cohort cannot be obtained (such as six calves total to provide three calves each for the treatment and control groups). If only 3\u20135 age-matched calves are obtained, the cohort can proceed, as long as one calf is a control (vehicle alone).Dairy facilities vary in their willingness to allow laboratory personnel to manually assist delivery of calves on-site because of biosecurity and/or liability concerns for potential personal injury. In such cases, accept only calves for which dairy personnel have manually assisted delivery onto the plastic sheet barrier, then placed into a disinfected wheelbarrow for transport to the designated disinfected concrete area where laboratory personnel can determine acceptability and process acceptable calves further. If there is any inadvertent minimal soiling of otherwise acceptable calves, calves are thoroughly cleaned with 7% iodine scrub and towel dried.Calves have room to rise/lie down and move/maneuver within the stall and may be able to turn completely around and reverse their position in the stall. This is most likely to occur if smaller calves <32 kg are used, during the first few days acclimating to stalls, prior to infection and onset of diarrhea. If calves turn themselves around in the stall such that their posterior is at the front of the stall, reposition them properly. However, in such cases, most of the feces excreted during the previous 12-h period will have ended up in the urine collection bin. If the feces are normal or loose but not diarrheic, urine tends to float on top of the feces. In such cases, carefully pour or aspirate off urine to allow fecal collection. If the feces are diarrheic, there is mixing with urine and the collection is essentially lost for evaluation and noted in the record as such. However, we have rarely (~1 in 50 calves) observed calves turning around in the stall when larger calves \u226538 kg are used, and this is the primary reason calves <38 kg are excluded. Needless to say but stated to ensure absolute clarity, never use the headlock between 12-h periods to prevent calves from turning around in the stall. This would be grossly inhumane and constitute animal abuse, prevent the calf from laying down, and result in death from asphyxiation if the calf is unable to stand. Also never use the front head gate bars to headlock a calf for more than ~5 min, if at all. The headlock is intended strictly to facilitate brief restraint for blood draws, etc.Some calves suckle so intensely that a vacuum may form in the bottle during nursing, eventually precluding additional ingestion. Only use nipple bottles that incorporate a ~1 mm diameter air release valve port at the nipple base to allow air to enter the bottle as the calf is nursing, thus precluding vacuum formation. If necessary, massage or press next to the valve port to release any vacuum. After feeding is completed verify that the valve is not plugged due to inadequate cleaning and is working properly. Colostrum replacer powder does not go into solution easily. To thoroughly reconstitute and solubilize colostrum replacer, gradually add the specified amount of powder per calf (twice the manufacturer\u2019s recommended dose, or 2 packets totaling 940 g powder) to a 6-L bucket containing 2 L of clean tap water at 110\u2013120 \u00b0F using a manual whisk. It is critical to whisk the preparation during reconstitution until no visible clumps remain. Following consumption of the full dose of colostrum replacer, add ~250 mL clean warm water to the same nipple bottle, swirl vigorously to rinse residual colostrum replacer, and feed this to the calf to ensure complete dosing.Bovine colostrum contains variable titers of antibody reactive with C. parvum, acquired from natural exposure or previous infection. However, no significant neutralizing antibody is present following previous infection as normal colostrum-fed calves are readily infected with C. parvum. Nevertheless, while expensive, commercial colostrum replacer is used to eliminate this variable in entirety. A commercial colostrum replacer such as the one we use has been formulated to replace maternal colostrum and negate lot to lot and inherent variability found in source dairy-acquired colostrum (bovine IgG colostrum replacer, Land O\u2019Lakes, Shoreview, MN). Frozen whole colostrum acquired from most source dairies varies substantially in antibody content, quality, and microbial contamination load, and should be avoided.Calves are born agammaglobulinemic. They require colostral antibodies following birth for passive transfer of immunity against the major enteropathogenic bacteria and viruses responsible for neonatal diarrhea and mortality for which commercially available maternal vaccines exist (there is presently no commercially available maternal vaccine for Cryptosporidium). The newborn calf\u2019s ability to absorb ingested colostral antibody decreases linearly over the first 24 h of age during the process of gut closure. By 12 h of age, the reduction is substantial and by 24 h of age, the gut is essentially closed to absorption of colostral antibody and other macromolecules. For this reason, ensure that calves suckle the majority of the recommended colostrum replacer dose, preferably within 6 h after birth but no later than 9 h after birth. Feed any colostrum replacer remaining at 9 h after birth by esophageal intubation.Feeding colostrum replacer by esophageal tube should be used as a last resort due to the fact that intubating (unlike suckling) does not stimulate the esophageal (gastric) groove closure reflex and thus delivers replacer into the rumen instead of the abomasum [28].Adjust the width of the stall\u2019s front head gate bars to allow only the head to have free access through the bars. This will allow calves to easily access water and/or electrolyte buckets, while also preventing a calf from jumping through the front of the stall and potentially getting trapped or injured. This potential problem is uncommon and typically occurs only if smaller calves <32 kg are used and the head gate bars are improperly positioned. We have never observed this problem using calves \u226538 kg with head gate bars positioned properly. Other than bruising acquired by two small 30\u201332 kg calves jumping through the front of the stall, we have also never had a calf acquire any injury being housed in elevated stalls. Nevertheless, it is important after assembling newly purchased stalls to file down any sharp or jagged edges on the framing or exposed hardware. Periodically inspect stalls for the same and to ensure that all hardware fasteners are securely tightened to maintain stall stability. Periodically inspect the rubberized flooring for wear and deterioration from use of harsh disinfectants and replace when necessary.Similar to colostrum replacer, milk replacer powder does not go into solution easily. Use warm (110\u2013120 \u00b0F) water and a whisk to thoroughly reconstitute replacer until all clumps are fully dissolved.Feed milk replacer via esophageal tube as a last resort measure for calves which will not consume any of the calculated volume of replacer in a ~25\u201330-min feeding period. The suckle response resulting in esophageal (gastric) groove closure is voided by tube feeding, delivering milk replacer into the rumen. Additionally, in our experience, calves which are tube fed more than ~3\u20134 times are reluctant to feed from a nipple bottle subsequently.Failure of passive transfer (FPT) of maternal immunoglobulins is rare if commercial colostrum replacer (at twice the label dose) is suckled within 6-9 h of birth. However, if FPT occurs, but the calf is otherwise healthy at 24 h of age, treat it by intravenous transfusion of commercially available adult bovine plasma (Lake Immunogenics, Ontario, NY) administered under supervision by a veterinarian.We have never experienced a calf not receiving the entire oocyst inoculum using the method described, but it could potentially happen (leakage, expectoration). If this occurs, note in the records the estimated volume of inoculum not received and that data from the calf may not be suitable for use in final analyses.It is potentially possible that some urine may enter the fecal collection bins, voiding accurate fecal volume determination. This possibility is largely eliminated if the plastic diversion sheet is stretched tightly against the bottom at the rear third of the stall and properly secured with reinforced waterproof industrial strength adhesive tape. This ensures that urine flows only in one direction, toward the front of the stall and into the urine collection bin. This is also a secondary reason calves <38 kg are excluded, as smaller calves can move back and forth in the stall to a greater extent and make accurate placement of the plastic diversion sheet difficult, especially for calves <32 kg.Calves infected with C. parvum in this model shed extremely large numbers of oocysts, especially the untreated controls. A single experimentally infected newborn calf may shed >1012 oocysts in feces during the peak days of diarrhea [11, 13]. Thus, personnel caring for calves are at high risk of zoonotic infection unless appropriate precautions are taken and adequate personal protective equipment is used while in calf rooms, minimally (1) disposable double gloves, (2) mid-calf high plastic or rubber boots over disposable plastic shoe covers, (3) Tyvek coveralls with elastic cinched ankle and wrist cuffs, (4) N95 respirators, (5) disposable hair bonnets, completely covering all hair (long hair must be tied back into a bun), and (6) goggles, safety glasses, or full face shields.An institutional protocol should be in place for evaluation of any calf personnel which develop nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea during or after a trial to determine the etiology and appropriate treatment. We use the University\u2019s Occupational Health Division for independent assessment of ill personnel and compliance with HIPPA. If C. parvum is identified as the etiologic agent the experimental protocol should be carefully reviewed to determine where the breach leading to zoonotic transmission likely occurred so that it can be addressed. Despite the precautions described here, we have had at least one documented case of zoonotic transmission.Adhering closely to the methods described here for calf procurement, we have never had a calf inadvertently infected with a field isolate of C. parvum, and have had only four calves in the last ~100 used inadvertently infected with field acquired enteropathogenic bacteria.We use a standardized daily AM/PM form for each calf that has all health evaluation parameters listed along with the scoring scale for each to record consensus scores; rectal temperature; amount of milk replacer, water and/or oral electrolytes consumed; date and actual AM/PM times (h, min) data were recorded, and calf ear tag #, with a signature box for each of the two attending staff involved (Daily Health Observation Record). Standardized forms are also used for all other information described in methods for which it is stated that records are made (Newborn Calf Record, Cryptosporidium Infection Record, Daily Fecal Volume Record, Test-Therapeutic Dosing Record, Concomitant Treatment Record, and Condition(s) Requiring Examination by the Attending Veterinarian Record).The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug flunixin meglumine should be used sparingly, and only when absolutely needed. No more than three doses total during a trial period should be administered to a given experimental calf to avoid nephrotoxicity and gastrointestinal toxicity. Toxicity is of greatest concern when administered to dehydrated calves.Fecal dry matter percentages may optionally be determined on total daily fecal collections as an additional index of diarrhea severity. However, in the model presented here, we found previously that fecal dry matter percentages added little to fecal consistency scores and total daily fecal volumes in determining diarrhea severity and have since discontinued percent dry matter determinations.Calves with diarrhea are prone to cutaneous scalding in the perianal and tail base regions. Use human infant sanitary wipes or warm wet paper towels to gently clean these regions as needed. If indicated, apply generic human infant diaper rash ointment liberally after cleaning the region. In such cases, this should be done prior to feeding or taking rectal temperature, both of which stimulate defecation.When calves are reluctant but able to stand for evaluation and feeding, rapidly and repeatedly stroke the hair coat from the hip region toward the shoulders. This is usually effective in getting the calf to stand. Alternatively, grasp the hip region and gently rock the calf back and forth laterally to stimulate initiation of the standing motion.The drugs used for sedation and euthanasia are controlled (scheduled) substances. A DEA license is required to obtain these. If the investigator does not have a DEA license, obtain the drugs through the attending veterinarian and comply with all record keeping and other requirements.\n\n",
