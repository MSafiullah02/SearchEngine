It has become increasingly clear that changes in the existing health care system will not be sufficient to maintain and improve our health at this historical juncture. Both our extensive knowledge on what creates health as well as the exponentially rising rates of chronic disease, obesity, and mental health problems indicate that we need to shift course and apply a radically new mind-set to health and health policy. This is what we mean by policy innovations for health. The boundaries of what we call the \"health system\" are becoming increasingly fluid and health has become integral to how we live our everyday life. Health itself has become a major economic and social driving force in society. This shifts the pressure for policy innovation from a focus on the existing health system to a reorganization of how we approach health in 21st century societies. The dynamics of the health society challenge the way we conceptualize and locate health in the policy arena and the mechanisms through which we conduct health policy. They also redefine who should be involved in the policy process. This concern is beginning to be addressed within government through Health in All Policy approaches and beyond government through new partnerships for health. Most importantly, the role of citizen and patient is being redefined -a development that will probably lead to the most significant of the policy innovations for health in the 21st century.",

John Gapper [1] Innovation for the authors of this book is about applying a radically new mindset to health and health policy with the goal of addressing the determinants of health and involving citizens in their health in new ways. This explains our choice of terminology: policy innovations for health. We start from a perspective that considers both health and innovation to be central driving forces in 21st century societies, and we maintain that their prominent role reflects major societal shifts that are under way. The consequence is not only a changing role of health in modern societies but also a new perception of innovation in relation to health.",

The shift from the industrial society of the 19th and 20th centuries to the knowledge societies of the 21st century is as ground-breaking as was the shift from the agrarian to the industrial world -and they are similar in their deep impact on health, this increases the need for innovation. The changes in our way of life are shaping our lifestyles and have created a situation where many of the patterns of everyday life -for example, our eating and food shopping patterns -and new forms of social stratification -for example, new forms of social inclusion and exclusion -endanger our health. This means that we need to understand that the health challenges and the diseases that come with this change are of a larger societal, not an individual nature.",

The authors of this book are focused on the second challenge and the policy mechanisms that are needed to address it. The need for change is vast. First, there is hardly a policy sector that can be excluded: health, education, agriculture, transport, industry, consumer affairs, and sports -all are essential to support health. Second, in a consumer society the role of business is critical and consumers themselves must express their demand. Finally, communities must act for their health interest and individuals are required to support their individual health and that of their families in new ways. To do so they need to be able to negotiate and navigate an increasingly complex health and care environment.",

            "text": "A recent analysis concerned with innovation and high performing health systems [2] underlines that there are two goals of innovation in relation to health: improving the affordability, quality, and efficiency of the health care system and improving the health of populations. Ideally the two would be fully complementary -in the real world they are not. Usually when we speak of innovation in the context of health the automatic assumption is that we mean the expansion of therapeutic possibilities -we associate new medicines, new technologies, and increasingly the potential of biomedicine and genetics. Sometimes we think of new approaches to the organization and financing of the medical care system, then we typically speak of \"health care reform\" -a term that is now linked almost exclusively with efficiency, effectiveness, and cost saving. The words innovation and health policy do not by and large sit very well together because the notion of \"newness\" and \"better\" that is at the core of innovation has been overshadowed by many short-term reorganizations of health care systems that seem to lack in vision and long-term perspective. And, if innovation is considered in terms of radical innovation only then we experience a clear tension between the drive for innovation and the constant challenge to keep down health care expenditures. A recent Health Innovation Survey by the OECD [3] typically focuses on the \"question how to encourage and foster innovation which addresses health needs and priorities, maximizes access to benefits, and manages challenges and risks in a way that is beneficial to both innovators and health systems.\" Innovation in this case is also mainly related to innovations in biotechnology and the key challenge is how OECD countries are able to cope with introducing such technical and product-based innovations into their respective health care systems. This focus on financial pressure has led -through a range of new assessment mechanisms -to a reinforcement of a binary understanding of innovation as being either radical or incremental and a focus on medical rather than social value.",

I argue that we now live in a health society which is characterized by two major social processes: the expansion of the territory of health and the expansion of the reflectivity of health [4] . The creation of the health society of the 21st century has been a process long in the making, beginning from about the mid 17th century onward. Health is integral to modernity and our modern societies would not be possible without the health gains achieved in this 250-year period [5] . During this time the balance of power between the four domains of the health systempersonal health, public health, medical health, and the health market -has shifted continuously. The domains of personal health and public health dominated the 18th and 19th centuries, while during the 20th century the medical health domain gained increasing strength both in terms of its power over the social definition of health and the dominance of its organizational and governance infrastructure; this process of dominance has been referred to as medicalization. As a consequence, in both political and public perceptions, the social organization of health resides in what we have come to call the health care system and concerns over how to ensure the long-term financial sustainability of this system dominate the health policy debate.",

In this health is similar to innovation, which is also increasingly defined as being fluid, an issue that will be reflected upon later in this chapter. Indeed the expansion and liquidity of boundaries is a major characteristic of what the sociologist Zygmunt Bauman calls \"liquid modernity\" [6] . This changes the health policy debate because it means that health is everywhere: every policy decision a government makes also impacts on health and at the individual level every behavioral choice also has a health consequence. This was always the case -but now it is part of reflective modernity. Most discussions on health policy do not yet take this deep seminal change into account -they still focus on tinkering with a well-defined functional system of health governance, where through a process of defining the evidence base, they aim to ensure clear boundaries, define interventions, and prioritize medical rather than social solutions. The authors of this book are of the opinion that we clearly need a policy approach that responds more adequately to the new environment of 21st century health.",

This is due to the fact that health itself has become a major economic and social driving force in society [7] and that good health outcomes are increasingly important for a range of societal goals. The Conference Board of Canada [2] suggests understanding innovation \"as a means by which societies, systems or organizations achieve social or economic value (e.g. increasing positive health outcomes)\"; they maintain that innovation occurs only when new value is created. Our focus in this book is to explore what kind of policy innovations for health are required to achieve better population health, in terms of both its social and economic value. We argue though that the issue at stake is not just another reorganization/improvement of the health care system or a better mechanism of integrating scientific progress into existing heath care systems but a reorganization of how we approach health in 21st century societies. In this we follow Peter Drucker's understanding of innovation as creating a new dimension of performance [8] .",

Witness the similarity of the statements from the public health perspective as voiced by Wilkinson and Marmot [9] , two of the most respected researchers on social determinants of health Good health involves reducing levels of educational failure, reducing insecurity and unemployment and improving housing standards. Societies that enable all citizens to play a full and useful role in the social, economic and cultural life of their society will be healthier than those where people face insecurity, exclusion and deprivation and as expressed in a recent publication commissioned by the European Commission [10] ...improving the health status of a population can be beneficial for economic outcomes at the individual and the national level. There is indeed much evidence to suggest that the association between economic wealth and health does not run solely from the former to the latter. An immediate, if general, policy implication that derives from this conclusion is that policy-makers who are interested in improving economic outcomes (e.g. on the labour market or for the entire economy) would have good reasons to consider investment in health as one of their options by which to meet their economic objectives.",

In view of new epidemiological developments -for example, the increase of overweight and obesity, early onset of diabetes, and an increase in mental health problems -the generation of children born at the turn of the 21st century could be the first to have a lower health and life expectancy than their parents.

Disease has boundaries; health does not. The new health challenges make this blatantly obvious. Within government the stakeholders in the response to obesity are not only the health ministry, but, for example, the ministries of transport, education, agriculture, trade, and consumer affairs. Outside of government the producers of unhealthy food and drink products are as much in focus as are the settings of everyday life where they are consumed (such as canteens), global marketing and advertising practices, the media messages, and the role model celebrities to name but a few. Smoking acts regulate not only who can buy tobacco products, where, and at what price but they define where it is permitted to smoke; in consequence, owners of bars and restaurants, retailers, and the management of airports and railway lines to name but a few, all need to be concerned with health in ways they were not before. Consumers and voters as well as a wide array of health action groups and patient organizations make their preferences heard. This infinite nature of health has consequences for all four domains of the health system. It is specific to the health society that all four domainspersonal health, public health, medical health,and the health market -not only continue to change and expand but -and this is critical -that the balance between the systems is shifting [28] . The health sector -consisting of the public health domain and the medical health domain -struggles to include more health, in the form of strengthening public health, health promotion, and prevention. Yet, this approach is falling short in many countries, in particular for lack of political support, except where the measures are clearly medical, such as expanding screening or strengthening predictive medicine. While the new paradigms in preventative medicine are gaining increasing acceptance, public health measures are considered unduly paternalistic and are seen to impinge on the individual freedom of choice. Structural measures addressing the determinants are also not politically popular, as they usually impinge on one or the other economic interest. There have been excellent policy documents such as the Wanless Report in England [29] that have proposed to embark on an organizational shift within the health sector toward public health, driven in particular by the fear generated by the relentless growth of the medical health domain. They argue that more money needs to be invested in prevention, health promotion, and public health; otherwise, our societies will not be able to afford the constant expansion of the medical health system. So far within the health sector very few policies, institutions, organizations, and funding streams have clearly differentiated between investing for health and the expenditures for providing medical care. Durand-Zalesky makes this point in great detail in the contribution to this book and she underlines how important the political innovation environment is for a public health agenda focused on determinants -in the case of policy innovation for health the different perceptions of the role of the state, the market and the individuals are critical.",

The perception of open innovation now means to involve a broad range of partners in order to find innovative solutions, particularly in the form of innovation clusters. As used to be the case in business, the functional and hierarchical approach in the medical and the public health domains do not usually allow for this. There are therefore very few policy mechanisms that allow decision makers to consider both health determinants and health impacts in an integrated manner and to approach the new health challenges with joined up policy responses, initiatives, and interventions. Usually each policy (sub) domain works to its own logic and intentions without regard for the impact on other areas of society or its global impact.

In order to achieve the targets it became clear that policies in the health sector needed to be complemented by other sectors of government and that they in turn needed to be supported by policy commitments at different levels of government and in the private and nongovernmental sector. The Wanless report calls this the fully engaged scenario [31] .

I have described Health in All Policies as an innovative policy strategy that responds to the critical role that health plays in the economies and social lives of 21st century societies. It introduces better health (improved population health outcomes) and closing the health gap as shared goals across all parts of government and addresses complex health challenges through an integrated policy response across portfolios. By incorporating a concern with health impacts into the policy development process of all sectors and agencies, it allows government to address the key determinants of health in a more systematic manner, while taking into account the benefit of improved population health for the goals of other sectors [35] . Some countries have tried to reflect such an approach by creating a ministerial mechanism for the focus on health rather than disease; for example, Canada for a while had a minister for public health with cabinet rank, and England and Sweden both have junior ministers for health.",

One such example \"Berlin's health care market\" is described in this book in more detail by Henke and Martin. Another example is the \"MyHeart\" project -which brings 33 partners from 11 countries together to develop \"intelligent textiles\" in order to prevent heart disease [36] or the innovations in the area of functional foods. Of particular interest as a policy innovation for health is the proposal to establish \"The Nordic region as a global health lab\" [22] . It is proposed that the Nordic countries form an innovation cluster so that the Nordic region will become \"a global market leader for prevention solutions.\" They further state that \"the booming global market for health related products and services speaks in favor of joint initiatives, where knowledge and experiences produced within a research framework can be used to develop products and solutions attractive to the Nordic as well as the global market.\" They then go on to define the nine components that will give such an initiative a global competitive edge:",

A good example is the European Platform on Diet, Physical Activity and Health initiated in 2005 by the DG Sanco of the European Commission, which allows the commission to work with a wide range of players across the public, private, and nongovernmental sectors [37] . The stated intent is to create a platform for concrete actions designed to contain or reverse current trends, platform members must commit to action. As underlined in the White Paper on Strategy for Europe on Nutrition, Overweight and Obesity Related Health Issues, the Commission considers that the development of effective partnerships must be the cornerstone of Europe's response to tackling nutrition, overweight and obesity, and their related health problems. In such platforms the members agree to monitor and evaluate the performance of commitments in a transparent, participative and accountable way; the EU Platform, for example, works to a founding member's statement, has a monitoring framework and produces progress reports. The visibility and legitimacy conferred through such alliances is gaining increasing importance as a policy mechanism as are a myriad of public-private partnerships. Actors and issues gain prominence through media presentation and public debate as the health society is also a media-driven society. These platforms constitute a new political space for health and network governance, particularly for very controversial issues. The European Commission, for example, uses a multistakeholder platform to address alcohol issues through an \"Alcohol and Health Forum,\" bringing together civil society and businesses pledging to take action to reduce alcohol-related harm in Europe [35] .",

The sociology of innovation describes the innovation paradox, which postulates that in the knowledge society the role of the producer and the role of the consumer move ever closer together -health as well as innovation therefore need to be considered as coproduced goods [24] .

On the one hand it is particularly difficult for the health care system to accept participation, because it has been defined by a very strong hierarchy between the professional physician, other health professionals, and the patient. Yet the management of chronic disease and the adherence to prevention regimes can only be achieved with full participation of the individual concerned. The overlap of unmet medical needs and unmet social needs can only be addressed jointly between patients, providers, and the social support system -patient input is a prerequisite to developing the kind of integrated disease-management models that most health systems still do not provide because they are out of step with the epidemiological and social development. The unmet medical and social need has led to the creation of a wide range of highly active patient organizations and self-help groups who act as the experts on \"their\" disease. The same applies to prevention and health promotion -the active participation of the individual, social groups, and communities is needed to engage in successful initiatives [39] .",

Consumers want simplicity, convenience, speed, and a good price [41] . Increasingly the two expectations meet as health systems become increasingly market driven and as patients want more say and have higher expectations. New products and technologies can only develop their full potential if they meet processes and structures that allow them to do so. This implies new forms of information, communication, and integration processes. The Conference Board of Canada in its recent analysis [2] defines three dimensions of high performing health systems: people and culture, technologies, and structure and processes. This is also reflected in the more recent literature on innovation which speaks of a paradigm shift toward a \"fluid identity of innovation\" [42] . This means the \"old\" debates as to what constitutes a radical innovation and an incremental innovation is considered less and less relevant. This is often much more obvious in other, less regulated areas than the health sector.",

Similar questions arise in relation to medicines and medical technology which with the rise of chronic disease fulfill more than their primary medical function -they cannot cure any more so they will seek to reduce pain and the progress of disease, lengthen life, improve mobility, ensure independence, be easy to use, etc. The innovation process around medicines for HIV/AIDS is a typical case in point -every small improvement in the lives of AIDS patients counts and it continues to be driven not only by medical innovation but a very strong demand from influential user and advocacy groups.",

This knowledge-based value creation willas Sakellarides states -probably be the most relevant health policy innovation in the next decade. Health Consumer Powerhouse regularly publishes a ranking which indicates in which countries consumers and patients have the most rights and the most opportunities for participation [43] . A recent German survey showed that most citizens would like to see a ranking of physicians and would like to see their medical bills. [44] .

While the health society offers many opportunities of empowerment, it can also be prescriptive and exert social control through health [47] . Within a health society there has to be constant democratic dialog about the societal value we attach to health, a debate that has barely begun. Providing access to information on health and new health products and services including e-health is only a small part of the issues at stake as Sakellarides points out in his chapter.
