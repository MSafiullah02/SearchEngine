            "text": "One of the biggest challenges in vaccine development is their inability to stimulate efficient immune responses in the targeted host. This drawback led to improvement of various approaches for DNA and protein/polypeptide delivery into cells (Kardani et al. 2019a, b). Some of these approaches are electroporation (Sardesai and Weiner 2011), nebulization (Rajapaksa et al. 2014), liposomes (Schwendener 2014), cationic polymers (Bolhassani et al. 2014), polyethyleneimine (PEI) (Ma and Yang 2010), gold nanoparticles (Dings et al. 2018), carbon nanotubes (Hasnain and Nayak 2019), and cell penetrating peptides (Bolhassani et al. 2015). Among them, cell-penetrating peptides could deliver different types of cargoes including DNA, proteins, liposomes, and inorganic particles in a safe way, and enhance the induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses (Kardani et al. 2019a, b; Bolhassani et al. 2015; Motevalli et al. 2018). Recently, various unnatural CPPs were prepared such as amphipathic peptides (e.g., Cady and Pep) (Kurzawa et al. 2010), highly positive charge proteins (e.g., supercharged green fluorescent protein: scGFP) (Motevalli et al. 2018; Shahbazi et al. 2018), and polyarginine peptides (e.g., HR9) (Crosio et al. 2019) for nucleic acid, protein or polypeptide delivery. Their cellular uptake is through direct penetration or endocytic pathways (Kardani et al. 2019a, b). It has proved by numerous studies that positively charge density of carriers enhanced their endosomal escape (McNaughton et al. 2009). For example, the scGFP has a theoretical net charge of + 36 (+ 36 GFP) by replacement of anionic amino acids in enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) with cationic residues (e.g., Arg and Lys) (Motevalli et al. 2018; Brock et al. 2018). It is interesting to know that the supercharged CPPs are available in nature, as well. Several supercharged proteins exist in the capsids of different viruses including yellow fever virus (YFC) with a net charge of + 52, Dengue virus (DENV) with a net charge of + 42, and West Nile virus (WNV) with a net charge of + 46 (Freire et al. 2013; Freire et al. 2015b, a). Simeon et al. discovered a novel supercharged CPP known as B1 protein which has 244 residues in length and also a net charge of + 43 at neutral pH originated from a frameshifted eGFP. It was reported that B1 protein could deliver non-covalently nucleic acid cargoes and genetically fused proteins (Simeon and Chen 2013; Simeon et al. 2013).",

            "text": "Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) caused by human immunodeficiency virus type- 1 (HIV-1) is a problem of public health (Cluck and Underwood 2018). The genome of HIV-1 comprises of structural (env, gag and pol), regulatory (rev and tat), and accessory (nef, vpu, vif and vpr) genes. The HIV-1 genes encode 16 viral proteins in total (Li and De Clercq 2016). The absence of a potent vaccine against hypervariable HIV-1 led to novel design of regimens and approaches. One of these strategies is the use of immune-informatics tools to find highly conserved and most immunogenic T-cell epitopes, and develop an effective multi-epitope vaccine (MEV) (Cluck and Underwood 2018; Li and De Clercq 2016; Kardani et al. 2019a, b). In our previous study, two multi-epitope-based vaccine candidates consisting various immunogenic T-cell epitopes of HIV-1 proteins (Nef-Vif-Gp160-P24 and Nef-Vpu-Gp160-P24) were designed against both human and mouse MHC molecule alleles (Kardani et al. 2019a, b). In the current report, the supercharged B1 CPP was generated in bacterial expression system, and its ability was evaluated to deliver both multi-epitope-based vaccine candidates in vitro and in vivo and enhance immune responses for the first time. Herein, the potency of different immunization modalities including DNA prime/DNA boost, DNA prime/multi-epitope peptide boost, and multi-epitope peptide prime/multi-epitope peptide boost were evaluated and compared to effectively induce cellular immune responses.",

The flow cytometry results were indicated by the percentage of protein expression using B1 reporter marker. The results showed that the mean of cellular uptake for B1 protein, B1/pEGFP-nef-vif-gp160-p24 nanoparticle, and B1/pEGFP-nef-vpu-gp160-p24 nanoparticle was ~ 60.19%, ~ 35.64% and ~ 32.63%, respectively. It was previously observed that the transfection efficacy was ~ 53.72% and ~ 66.85% for the TurboFect/pEGFP-nef-vpu-gp160-p24 and TurboFect/pEGFP-nef-vif-gp160-p24 complexes, respectively (Kardani et al. 2019a, b). In addition, the transfection efficiency of TurboFect/pEGFP-N1 and TurboFect/pEGFP-B1 was ~ 95.69% and ~ 68.55%, respectively. Regarding these data, B1 protein could penetrate efficiently and also enhance DNA delivery in the cells. On the other hand, B1 protein was expressed successfully instead of eGFP using TurboFect transfection reagent. Western blot analysis validated the permeability of pEGFP-N1/TurboFect, pEGFP-B1/TurboFect, B1 protein, pEGFP-nef-vif-gp160-p24/B1, and pEGFP-nef-vpu-gp160-p24/B1 using an anti-His-tag antibody (Fig. 7). Our data indicated a single band of ~ 32 kDa in the cells treated with the pEGFP-nef-vif-gp160-p24/B1 and pEGFP-nef-vpu-gp160-p24/B1 nanoparticles, and a single band of ~ 27 kDa for eGFP and B1 proteins as compared to untransfected cells.",

            "text": "The non-viral delivery of DNA cargoes into mammalian cells is critical for therapeutic applications (Akinc et al. 2010). The delivery vehicles usually bind to negatively charged components of cell membranes, and then uptake into the cells (Wadia et al. 2004). Several delivery systems were offered to increase the induction of immune responses in vivo such as cationic polymers, virosomes, liposomes, nanoparticles, and cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) (Jorritsma et al. 2016; Suschak et al. 2017). Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) penetrate into the cells to deliver biologically active cargoes. CPPs are short peptides (less than 30 amino acids) which are divided into cationic, amphipathic and hydrophobic categories based on their physicochemical properties (Kardani et al. 2019a, b). On the other hand, the engineered proteins involving cationic regions were developed to penetrate into the cells such as a penta-mutant GFP containing a patch of five arginine amino acids (Fuchs and Raines 2007). Moreover, the supercharged green fluorescent protein (scGFP) is a type of highly positively charged proteins which could deliver various cargoes in vitro (Motevalli et al. 2018; Shahbazi et al. 2018). In several studies, different variants of supercharged GFP were developed to transfer efficiently cargoes into mammalian cells (McNaughton et al. 2009). For instance, Lu et al. produced a series of supercharged GFP proteins ranging from \u2212 30 to + 48 net theoretical charges which were able to deliver nucleic acids (Lawrence et al. 2007). Herein, B1 as one of the scGFPs was used to deliver DNA cargoes efficiently into mammalian cell lines. Previously, Simeon et al. demonstrated that B1 can be localized in the nucleus (Simeon and Chen 2013; Simeon et al. 2013).",

            "text": "In the current study, the levels of cellular and humoral immune responses were evaluated by various immunization strategies using two different multi-epitope constructs (Nef-Vpu-Gp160-P24 and Nef-Vif-Gp160-P24 antigens), and B1 cell-penetrating protein as a delivery system. At first, B1 protein was expressed efficiently in E.coli Rosetta expression strain, and purified under native conditions. In contrast, Simeon et al. could express the B1 protein in E.coli BL21 (DE3) strain (Simeon and Chen 2013; Simeon et al. 2013). However, protein-specific features such as temperature and time of induction can affect the yield of protein expression (Thompson et al. 2012). Moreover, our study indicated that B1 protein could form the stable nanoparticles with the nef-vpu-gp160-p24 and nef-vif-gp160-p24 multi-epitope DNA constructs at certain N/P ratio of 1:1. The B1 protein alone and in complex with multi-epitope DNA constructs was non-toxic at certain dose. We showed that B1 protein (+ 43 GFP) is stable in the presence of serum, and increases the serum half-life of plasmid DNA with which it is complexed. Indeed, a variant of + 43 GFP could mediate DNA transfection, enabling plasmid-based gene expression. This result was observed for DNA delivery using + 36 GFP (McNaughton et al. 2009). It was reported that superpositively charged proteins including + 36 GFP could penetrate into the mammalian cells with high potency in comparison to modestly cationic engineered proteins or cationic peptides (McNaughton et al. 2009). Recently, Bolhassani et al. confirmed that + 36 GFP can penetrate into cells efficiently in vitro and in vivo (Vahabpour et al. 2019). Moreover, Castanho et al. showed that the Dengue virus (DENV) capsid protein with a net charge of + 42 was able to deliver functional nucleic acids into mammalian cells (Freire et al. 2013). Our data demonstrated that B1 protein has notable efficiency to deliver both multi-epitope DNA constructs into HEK-293T cells. The flow cytometry results showed that the percentage of nef-vif-gp160-p24 and nef-vpu-gp160-p24 DNA expression was about 35.64% and 32.63%, respectively. These percentages were approximately 53.72% and 66.85% for TurboFect/pEGFP-nef-vpu-gp160-p24 and TurboFect/pEGFP-nef-vif-gp160-p24, respectively. In addition, the transfection efficiency of TurboFect/pEGFP-N1 and TurboFect/pEGFP-B1 was ~ 95.69% and ~ 68.55%, respectively. Indeed, eGFP replaced by B1 (pEGFP-B1) indicated that B1 can be expressed successfully in mammalian cells. On the other hand, B1 protein could penetrate into the cells about 60.19% without any transfection reagent. Thus, it is suitable to use B1 protein for delivery of other cargoes. The western blot analysis confirmed the potent transfection of both DNA constructs using B1 at N/P ratio of 1:1 as clear bands of about 32 kDa in vitro.",

Recently, it was reported that the heterologous prime-boost immunization strategy could enhance both humoral and cellular immunity in various laboratory animal models (Kardani et al. 2020, 2016; Stachyra et al. 2017; Vald\u00e9s et al. 2019). Our data demonstrated that groups administrated by the DNA/B1 nanoparticles induced notably higher levels of IFN-\u03b3, IL-5 and Granzyme B as compared to groups receiving the naked DNAs. Moreover, the levels of IFN-\u03b3 and Granzyme B were significantly higher in groups immunized with different regimens of Nef-Vif-Gp160-P24 than groups immunized with the same regimens of Nef-Vpu-Gp160-P24. On the other hand, the levels of IgG2a and IgG2b in groups administrated by the heterologous DNA + B1 prime/multi-epitope peptide + Montanide boost were enhanced similar to the homologous multi-epitope peptides + Montanide as compared to other groups. In our previous study, immunization of BALB/c mice using the heterologous DNA + HR9 or MPG CPP prime/multi-epitope peptide + CyLoP-1 or LDP-NLS boost modalities for both constructs could significantly increase the levels of IgG2a, IgG2b, IFN-\u03b3, and Granzyme B directed toward Th1 immune responses as compared to homologous prime/boost with multi-epitope DNA or peptide constructs (Kardani et al. 2020). On the other hand, mice immunization with human papillomavirus (HPV) E7 protein/ + 36 GFP nanoparticles induced a higher Th1 cellular immune response with the predominant IgG2a and IFN-gamma levels than those induced by E7 protein, alone. It was observed that the E7 DNA/ + 36 GFP and E7 protein/ + 36 GFP nanoparticles similarly protected mice against TC-1 tumor challenge (~ 67%) as compared to E7 DNA and E7 protein (~ 33%) (Motevalli et al. 2018). Herein, we showed that B1 protein could induce Th1 cellular immune responses in heterologous DNA prime/multi-epitope peptide boost immunization. However, B1 protein could enhance the secretion of IgG1 and IL-5 in DNA immunization. Indeed, our data showed a mixture of Th1 and Th2 responses directed toward Th1 response especially in heterologous prime-boost regimens.",

Our data demonstrated that B1 protein complexed with both constructs drives T cell responses towards a Th1-type without side effects. These stable nanoparticles (DNA/B1 protein) with a lower dose of DNA plasmids (2 \u00b5g versus 50 \u00b5g of the naked DNA) increased the uptake of DNA constructs, and subsequently stimulated both humoral and cellular immune responses in immunized mice. However, further studies are required to determine its mechanism in vitro and in vivo as well as its efficiency in a challenge model.",
