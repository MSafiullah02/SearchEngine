Egyptian scholars recognized that local inflammation was responsible for fever. In 1868, Billroth (1829-1894) attempted to confirm this ancient observation by injecting pus into animals, thereby producing a febrile response. In 1943, Menkin carried out similar experiments and isolated a product termed \"pyrexin\" [1] . Beeson in 1948 isolated a fever-inducing substance from a leukocyte, leukocyte pyrogens, which later became known as endogenous pyrogen (EP). Interleukin-1 (IL-1) was first identified as a cytokine by Gery and Waksman and proved to be identical with EP [2] .",

The resulting temperature increase continues until body temperature approximates to the temperature of the elevated set point. The cations Na + and Ca 2+ as well as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp) may also contribute to the alteration of body temperature, although their exact role is not yet clear. The raised set point is reset back to normal if the concentration of IL-1 falls or if antipyretics are administered, which blocks prostaglandin synthesis. Recently, the peptide angiotensin 11 has been shown to lower body temperature at the final step of fever [9] .
