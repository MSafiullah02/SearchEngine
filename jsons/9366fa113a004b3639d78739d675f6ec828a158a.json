As of this writing, the slope of the upward portion of the logarithmic curve of cases and deaths in the US is unclear and much is unknown about the virology and epidemiology of the disease. Furthermore, the short-and long-term impact of this pandemic on the medical community and society, at-large, is yet to be understood. Nevertheless, it is becoming clearer, however, that we are settling into a new and dynamic reality as a medical specialty. If leveraged well, the operational efficiencies realized in response to current challenges will be an asset. However, we must be mindful of taking steps that don't inadvertently lead us all towards a less optimal future.",

Of these 18 patients, four had received systemic therapy within the past month and the other 12 were in follow-up. The authors conclude that cancer patients are at higher risk -perhaps not surprising -and that greater attention should be paid to intentional postponing of care and constructive exploitation of disease surveillance as a partial mitigation strategy to flatten the curve via the protection patients and health care workers alike.

The rollout of such platforms can be immensely useful, both in the short run for permitting physicians to continue to care for their own patients, but perhaps in the future in helping institutions broaden their catchment, especially in rural areas. What if much of the E&M portions of care could be transitioned to a telemedicine platform, especially for patients living at distance from the hospital? When coupled with increasing utilization of hypofractionation, such technologies could allow our facilities to reach even more patients than ever before.

How can we further improve patient flow, setup, and on treatment care to minimize their risk for infection, and ours? Virtual visits in department, texting appointment updates, and other creative all are being tested. We must share best practices well through formalized, sharable electronic means (e.g. ASTRO board) that are accessible to all.

We unfortunately won't be able to truly quantify the excess risk for each patient for COVID exposure, at least for some time while observational data mature. But we do have much better data for the risks delaying individual patients might have on local control and survival. \"Do no harm\" is not as simple as minimizing COVID exposure risk, as some recent commentaries have suggested (3) . Each team of physicians locally needs to start developing triage paradigms (4), similar to the surgical world, for which patients are high, medium, or low risk from a cancer perspective, and develop workflows to get them in for treatment promptly, and safely. Indeed this has begun. One strategy is outlined in Table 1 . We suggest considering high risk patients as those with intact tumors (e.g. CNS, head and neck, lung, cervical, some pediatric, palliative) or those with aggressive histology (e.g. whereby a delay in treatment is likely to comprise outcomes). Perhaps counterintuitively, patients receiving chemotherapy should be prioritized; though risks of COVID disease may be higher, so too is the risk of treatment delay. Medium risk patients could be those where an objective local control benefit is risked by delay, but there is no known survival decrement (e.g. many GI sites, sarcoma, some GU cancers). Lower risk are those were outcome risk is lower and there is more room for pragmatism (e.g. most early breast, low or favorable intermediate risk prostate, T1 non-small cell lung cancer, and/or indolent lymphoma).",

Certainly the risks and benefits should be part of a shared decision making conversation between doctor and patient. As well, the ability to function well with less (fewer onsite staff, more distributed/remote resources) might mean future job challenges for much of our technical staff as administrators could question their future cost, necessity, and value, especially in a future bundled care era. We must keep all departmental enterprises functioning at a high level of output, in some cases creatively repurposing personnel for special projects. Departments must develop robust staffing plans, but also be pragmatic about testing, minimizing quarantine restrictions, and maintaining a viable workforce to continue uninterrupted operations. Our services are essential, and in most cases not elective, and our plans must reflect this.",

Now is a time to show that we are real doctors and always have been. If we are called to help, let's help, and let's establish our value within the hospital. We may suffer personal harm, but this is our responsibility. New and innovative opportunities for our future work and partnerships may emerge as a result. The entrepreneurs amongst us must develop new tools, both physical and electronic, during this time to care for patients. Though there is much fear amongst our patients and staff, and perhaps even ourselves, we must let equanimity under duress prevail (5) and provide much-needed tangible leadership that will benefit our current and future patients.
