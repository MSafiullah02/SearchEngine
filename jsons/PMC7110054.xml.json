            "text": "\nStreptococcus suis infection of swine is recognized as the leading cause of highly invasive diseases such as meningitis, septicemia, arthritis, and even sudden death, and has spread over 20 countries, resulting in great economic losses in pig-industries each year (Staats et al., 1997; Huang et al., 2005). Streptococcus suis is also a notorious zoonotic agent responsible for more than 200 cases of severe infections in humans worldwide since its first discovery in Denmark in 1968 (Staats et al., 1997). Thirty-five serotypes of S. suis have been determined based on differences among their capsule antigens (Staats et al., 1997). However, Hill (2005) recently suggested that the two serotypes (serotype 32 and serotype 34) may be excluded from S. suis species and redesignated as Streptococcus orisratti. Virulence varies greatly among the serotypes and can be divided into three groups: highly pathogenic, hypovirulent, and avirulent (Staats et al., 1997). Streptococcus suis 2 (SS2) is the most prevalent serotype isolated from both diseased piglets and patients worldwide and is often associated with severe clinical syndrome (Staats et al., 1997). In particular, two large-scale outbreaks of lethal SS2 infections with a hallmark of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) emerged in China (one in Jiangsu Province, 1998, and the other in Sichuan Province, 2005), posing a great global concern to the public health (Tang et al., 2006). As it is known that human SS2 infections have been documented for several decades, the molecular mechanism underlying the high pathogenicity of this bacterial agent is still poorly understood (Staats et al., 1997; Gottschalk et al., 1999). Several bacterial components have been previously implicated in S. suis virulence, but the exact role remains unclear (Staats et al., 1997; Gottschalk et al., 1999; Gottschalk & Segura, 2000). So far, the virulence-associated factors identified include components of capsule polysaccharide (CPS) (Smith et al., 2000), extracellular factor (EF) (Smith et al., 1993; Staats et al., 1999), muraminidase-released protein (MRP) (Staats et al., 1999), suilysin (Allen et al., 2001; Lun et al., 2003), adhesions (Tikkanen et al., 1996; Brassard et al., 2004), 38 kDa protein (Okwumabua & Chinnapapakkagari, 2005), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) (Okwumabua et al., 2001), fibronectin-binding protein (FBP) (de Greeff et al., 2002; Wang, 2006), hayluronate lyase (King et al., 2004), sortase A (srtA) (Osaki et al., 2002), arginine deiminase (Gruening et al., 2006), etc. In some instances, the virulence determination of some S. suis strains was still ambiguous, indicating that the virulence of S. suis is a complex interplay between the pathogen, its host, and the environment (Gottschalk et al., 1999). Considerable efforts to control severe SS2 infections have still been hampered greatly by the limited knowledge of S. suis pathogenesis (Staats et al., 1997; Gottschalk et al., 1999; Gottschalk & Segura, 2000; Haesebrouck et al., 2004).",

            "text": "It is widely accepted that the cell-wall-exposed proteins/outer surfaces of pathogenic bacteria are of great importance to understanding their pathogenesis (Navarre & Schneewind, 1999; Cabanes et al., 2002). Not only are surface-associated components implicated in bacterial defense machineries but also they are involved in virulence-related behaviors (e.g., adhesion) (Navarre & Schneewind, 1999; Maione et al., 2005). Thus, for vaccine development against pathogenic bacteria, current interest has shifted from the CPS antigen to surface proteins with robust immunogenicity (Navarre & Schneewind, 1999; Cabanes et al., 2002; Maione et al., 2005; Li et al., 2006). Whole genome-wide screening was carried out to search for a universal Group B Streptococcus (GBS) vaccine (Maione et al., 2005). These surface proteins containing a C-terminal cell wall anchoring motif (LPXTG) have been found in a variety of pathogenic microorganisms, and suggested to execute key steps during the process of infection, which range from colonization to invasion (Navarre & Schneewind, 1999; Cabanes et al., 2002; Osaki et al., 2002; Maione et al., 2005). In S. suis, MRP belongs to this type of surface protein (Smith et al., 1992). More recently, Li (2006) reported a novel surface protein, surface antigen one (Sao), from S735 strain of SS2, and evaluated its potential as a vaccine. Although it failed to protect piglets against SS2 infection completely, it was not determined whether or not this protein played any role in S. suis infection.",

During a genome-wide in silico screening for surface-exposed proteins or cell wall-associated proteins, a mutant of sao was accidentally found, in which 270 bp of repeated sequences at the 3\u2032-terminus was deleted. In light of this unexpected observation, it was attempted to examine the prevalence in various serotypes of S. suis, and test its possible genetic variation or molecular polymorphism. Thus, PCR screening was undertaken to test more than 50 different S. suis strains comprising 34 kinds of serotypes (except for S. suis 12). It was found that Sao proteins exhibit obvious polymorphisms with considerable genetic variation. Furthermore, it was possible to classify Sao into three groups and the proteins were also characterized via a range of biochemical techniques. Immunological data from Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) also demonstrated that Sao-M, the most common type of Sao, has strong immunogenicity. Sao-M has been successfully developed into an effective ELISA method for monitoring S. suis infection in both pigs and humans. Therefore, Sao may serve as a useful marker for clinical surveillance of S. suis infection.",

More than 50 different S. suis strains covering nearly all of the serotypes were cultivated for isolation of genomic DNA. The results of PCR screening yielded three distinct sao amplicons (Fig. 1a). Among those strains tested, the following conclusions could be drawn. First, sao is relatively common in different serotypes and/or strains of S. suis. Although PCR-negative results were obtained in several isolates such as Denmark strains 6704, 4417, 22083, etc. (Table S1, Fig. 2), this was largely in agreement with the Western blot results described by Li (2006). Second, according to various lengths of genes, sao could be referred to as sao-L (\u223c2.0 kb, L: long), sao-M (\u223c1.7 kb, M: middle), and sao-S (\u223c1.5 kb, S: small) (Fig. 1a). These data also suggested that sao-M is the most prevalent variant comprising about 80%, followed by sao-L, and sao-S is detected at no more than 6% (Fig. 2).",

The conventional strategy to control S. suis infections is overly dependent on prophylactic and therapeutic antibiotics, which has led to the isolation of antibiotic-resistant strains in recent years (Huang et al., 2005; Tang et al., 2006). Also, a lack of data describing the virulence factors contributing to the pathogenesis of S. suis has greatly hampered the development of novel vaccines and pharmaceutics against S. suis infections (Staats et al., 1997; Gottschalk et al., 1999). Thus, there is currently considerable interest in identifying and characterizing surface-exposed virulence factors of S. suis. Recently, a promising candidate called Sao has been described. Sao is a novel C-terminally anchored surface protein identified from S735, a virulent Holland strain (Li et al., 2006).",

Based on the search, a deletion mutant of sao could be identified that had 270 bp of repeated sequences missing from its 3\u2032-terminus. Then, 34 serotypes of S. suis were examined and three forms of sao genes were found among the different strains. Although sao genes could not be amplified from several S. suis strains (e.g., 10581, 2726, 865191, etc.), the absence of sao genes might have been caused by the considerable variation during the evolution of these serotypes. This was also validated by the result of a Western blot described by Li (2006). Although the existence of sao genes in a few strains (e.g., 4417) could not be detected despite positive results at the protein level (Li et al., 2006), other approaches will be attempted to determine the reasons for this discrepancy. The most frequently observed form of the sao gene was sao-M, which is the medium-sized version at \u223c1.7 kb. The results resemble those reported by Smith (1993). In that study, the authors also found EF, a derivative of EF* lacking the repeat units at its C-terminus, and was correlated with increased virulence (Smith et al., 1993). Therefore, it would be of interest to determine whether or not the present deletion variants in Sao proteins have any correlation with their pathogenicity of the organisms. The aberrantly larger apparent MW of Sao-L and Sao-M proteins, can be surmised to be due to the poor binding of SDS, which gives less charge density to the fragments than to the standard proteins and hence a higher apparent MW.",

In the case of avr in plant pathogenesis, this gene is associated with a hypersensitive response of the plant towards the pathogens (Yang et al., 2000). As such, several questions regarding Sao variants require further investigation. These are (1) is there an analogous host R protein binding to the Avr-like repeats of Sao? (2) Is a type III secretion system involved? (3) Does Sao function as a superantigen similar to what occurs with Staphylococcus aureus (Banks et al., 2003) and Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) (Alouf & Muller-Alouf, 2003)?",
