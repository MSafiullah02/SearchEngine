As of April 29, 2020, COVID-19 has been confirmed in more than 3 million individuals in 185 countries and regions, with an overall mortality rate of more than 6%.1 Severe disease involves bilateral interstitial pneumonia requiring intensive care unit (ICU) ventilatory support and can evolve into adult respiratory distress syndrome with high mortality. The largest study of 1591 ICU patients from Italy reported a median age of 63 years, with only 203 patients (13%) younger than 51 years.2 Common comorbidities are hypertension, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and, more rarely (42 [4%] of 1043), obstructive pulmonary disease. Similar data have been reported from China.3\n",

News reports and communications from the US Federal Government had emphasised that COVID-19 was a particular problem for older people, and a resistance to social distancing and sheltering in place by younger people might have been informed by this idea. However, as the pandemic hit the Johns Hopkins Hospital in late March, 2020, younger patients began to be admitted to our ICU, many of whom were also obese. An informal survey of colleagues directing ICUs at other hospitals around the country yielded similar findings. At this time, news editorials were noting obesity as an underappreciated risk factor for COVID-19.4 This risk is particularly relevant in the USA because the prevalence of obesity is around 40%, versus a prevalence of 6\u00b72% in China, 20% in Italy, and 24% in Spain.5\n",
