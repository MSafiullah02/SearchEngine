In this scenario, different centers worldwide are facing financial issues and dedicating all their resources and health care workers to the treatment of COVID-19 patients. As a consequence, clinical practice not related to pandemic control, such as surgeries and oncological follow-up, have become a challenge for patients and physicians. Therefore, different groups have published recommendations regarding the best approach for oncological patients during the current pandemic [2]. For instance, the recently published European Association of Urology (EAU) Robotic Urology Section guidelines describe the management of different urological cancers and recommend actions to minimize viral infection among oncological patients and health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic [3].",

However, follow-up and treatment plans for patients with masses > 4 cm may be more challenging. Of note, difficulties in defining proper management for patients with large renal masses mainly arise from the limited possibility of predicting how long this pandemic will last and for how long is it safe to postpone surgery for this group.",

However, a period longer than 6 mo may negatively affect overall survival [5]. Stec and colleagues [8] reported on the impact of surgical delays in a cohort of 722 patients. For a period of up to 6 mo, the authors found no difference in overall survival between the \u201cearly\u201d and \u201clate\u201d surgical intervention groups.",

As supported by the GORRG, renal surgery should be postponed by 6 mo when clinical harm (progression, metastasis, loss of renal function) is very unlikely within the next 6-mo period [5]. However, the data available and the level of evidence in the literature regarding delays in surgical treatment for locally advanced kidney cancer are still poor. Therefore, patients with a tumor \u2265 4 cm, stage progression, growth kinetics > 5 mm/yr, or deterioration of their clinical condition should be considered for surgery if possible [9]. In addition, patients with bleeding tumors with a hemodynamic impact, tumors with renal vein and vena cava thrombus, or large tumors causing compression of adjacent organs may be considered as surgical candidates during this period.",

We believe that patients suitable for AS should be offered this protocol with telemedicine or telephone follow-up to minimize viral exposure during hospital consultations. Surgical treatment for these patients can be postponed until conditions are favorable. However, for patients with high-risk and locally advanced tumors, such as the ones mentioned in this article, surgery should not be delayed because of a higher risk of tumor progression and life-threatening complications.",
