            "text": "A new strain of a novel infectious disease affecting millions of people, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Currently, several clinical trials are underway to identify specific drugs for the treatment of this novel virus. The inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease is necessary for the blockage of the viral replication. Here, in this study, we have utilized a blind molecular docking approach to identify the possible inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, by screening a total of 33 molecules which includes natural products, anti-virals, anti-fungals, anti-nematodes and anti-protozoals. All the studied molecules could bind to the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 protease (PDB: 6Y84), out of which rutin (a natural compound) has the highest inhibitor efficiency among the 33 molecules studied, followed by ritonavir (control drug), emetine (anti-protozoal), hesperidin (a natural compound), lopinavir (control drug) and indinavir (anti-viral drug). All the molecules, studied out here could bind near the crucial catalytic residues, HIS41 and CYS145 of the main protease, and the molecules were surrounded by other active site residues like MET49, GLY143, HIS163, HIS164, GLU166, PRO168, and GLN189. As this study is based on molecular docking, hence being particular about the results obtained, requires extensive wet-lab experimentation and clinical trials under in vitro as well as in vivo conditions.",

WHO, on 30 January 2020, declared this outbreak as Public Health Emergency of International Concern and later on 11 February 2020 named it as ) events as they happen,\" 2020). According to the data of WHO (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports), currently (as on 24 th April 2020), more than 2.6 million COVID-19 cases have been confirmed globally, and the number of death toll rose to 1,81,938 which are increasing exponentially. To date no specific medications have been developed, and therefore considering the risk factors associated with this disease, there is an urgent need for a treatment method to treat this disease in order to limit the transmission (Enayatkhani et al., 2020) . Among all the treatment strategies, the uses of already known viral medications have great advantages as the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety profiles of these drugs have already been established. This drug repurposing strategy has gained significance as they are expected to be faster with less investment (Fitchett et al., 2014; Law et al., 2013; Pant et al., 2020; Park, 2019) . Preliminary studies revealed Lopinavir/ritonavir combined therapy as a potential inhibitor of the virus. Along with these two drugs, many other antiviral drugs have also been screened (Lu, 2020; Xu et al., 2020) . Recently, anti-malarial drug chloroquine (M. and hydroxychloroquine (Gautret et al., 2020) have been reported to have certain curative effect on COVID-19. Due to diverse bioactivity and less toxicity, naturally occurring bioactive flavonoid molecules have also been screened for their potential therapeutic effects (Khaerunnisa et al., 2020; Thuy et al., 2020) . Numerous reports to identify the potential inhibitors of novel coronavirus have recently been published using computational methods (Aanouz et al., 2020; Elmezayen et al., 2020; Gupta et al., 2020; Muralidharan et al., 2020; Sarma et al., 2020) . The transcription of the genomic RNA inside the cell generates a polypeptide which is proteolytically cleaved by the main protease (M Pro which is also known as 3CL Pro or chymotrypsin-like protease) at 11 different sites to produce proteins necessary for the replication of the virus. Inhibition of the activity of the main protease is expected to block the viral replication as no human proteases are known having similar cleavage specificity (Boopathi et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) . Therefore M Pro is one of the most explored drug target among the corona viruses that plays a major role in the translation and replication of new generation viruses from the viral genomic RNA (Morse et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2006) . Many crystal structures of M Pro of SARS-CoV-2 have already been submitted to protein data bank (PDB) which are in both liganded and unbounded form (Jin et al., 2020; Owen et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) . The 3 D structure of SARS-CoV-2 M pro (PDB ID. 6Y84), is made up of three domains, where domain I, II and III spans across 8-101, 102-184 and 201-306 amino acid residues, repectively. Domain I and II mainly consists of b-barrels while domain III mainly consists of a-helices (S. A. . The substrate/active site of binding is located at the cleft of domain I and II, which consists of two catalytic residues, namely, HIS41 and CYS145 ( Figure 1 ).",

Ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, penciclovir and lopinavir are known drugs that have been screened for the treatment of COVID-19. The reason for them being used as control drugs in the study is that, as mentioned earlier, lopinavir/ritonavir combination, and anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine has recently been found to be a potential inhibitor of the virus, while penciclovir could also inhibit the virus to some extent (M. . Considering the diverse pharmaceutical properties of the natural products including anti-viral properties (Jo et al., 2020; Thayil & Thyagarajan, 2016; Zakaryan et al., 2017) , a total of 17 compounds: curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, (-)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), (-)-epigallocatechin, (EGC), hesperidin, myricitrin, puerarin, scutellarin, rutin, quercitrin, capsaicin, ursolic acid, glabridin, apiin, rhoifolin, glycyrrhizin, and vitexin were screened for their inhibitory potential against SARS-CoV-2 M pro . Azidothymidine, indinavir, tipranavir, and saquinavir are the well-known anti-viral drugs (De Clercq & Li, 2016) , while diethylcarbamazine, primaquine, mepacrine, artemisinin and niclosamide are the anti-nematodes (Panic et al., 2014) and emetine, an anti-protozoal drug (Akinboye & Bakare, 2011) , which have also been screened for their inhibitory potentials. Further, two anti-fungals, namely, fluconazole and itraconazole (Vardakas et al., 2005) were also docked to the main protease of COVID-19. This study is focused on the repurposing/identification of compounds with a sole aim to expedite the identification of specific drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.",

Figure 2a shows that penciclovir binds firmly through three conventional hydrogen bonds with residues HIS41, CYS44 and GLU166 besides other interactions such as carbon-hydrogen bonds (ASN142 and MET165) and van der Waals interactions. Ritonavir binds to the active site of SARS-CoV-2 with different types of noncovalent interactions, as depicted in Figure 2b . Ritonavir stabilizes in the active site through hydrogen bonding with THR25 and SER46, p-sigma with THR26, alkyl hydrophobic with MET165, p-alkyl hydrophobic with LEU27, CYS145 and PRO168, and van der Waals interactions with other residues as depicted in the 2 D plot. Hydroxychloroquine, a promising candidate for the treatment of the current pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2 (Gautret et al., 2020) , has been found to bind within the active site of the protease through p-sulphur interaction with MET165, p-sigma with GLN189, alkyl hydrophobic with LEU167 and PRO168, and van der Waals interactions with other residues as shown in Figure 2c . Similarly, lopinavir interacts with the residues in the active site through hydrogen bonding with THR26, p-sulphur interaction with CYS145 and alkyl hydrophobic with PRO168, besides van der Waals interaction with other residues as depicted in the 2 D plot (Figure 2d ). The fullfitness score along with the estimated free energy (DG) of binding of the above mentioned drugs are listed in Table 1 . If we compare in terms of the DG value, we can see that ritonavir has the most negative DG value with -9.52 kcal/mol followed by lopinavir, then hydroxychloroquine and finally penciclovir. This can be directly correlated with the number of non-covalent interactions that these drugs undergo with the surrounding residues within the active site of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the stability of a particular drug within the active site is also associated with the number of p-interactions that it undergoes with the surrounding residues (Arthur & Uzairu, 2019) . The electrostatic surface potential of the binding site along with the simultaneous presence of the four drugs are shown in Figure S2 .",

On comparison of the DG value, which gives the estimated free energy of binding, we can infer that the binding affinity of the natural products towards SARS-CoV-2 protease follows the following order rutin (\u00c09.55 kcal/mol).> hesperidin (\u00c09.02 kcal/mol) > apiin (\u00c08.74 kcal/mol) > puerarin (\u00c08.43 kcal/mol) > Rhoifolin (\u00c08.37 kcal/mol) > scutellarin (\u00c08.32 kcal/mol) > quercitrin (\u00c08.26 kcal/mol) > curcumin (8.15 kcal/mol) > capsaicin (\u00c08.12 kcal/mol) > EGCG (7.96 kcal/ mol) > demethoxycurcumin (\u00c07.87 kcal/mol) $ myricitrin (\u00c07.85 kcal/mol) $ ursolic acid (\u00c07.84 kcal/mol) $ vitexin (\u00c07.82 kcal/ mol) $ glycyrrhizin (\u00c07.81 kcal/mol) > glabridin (\u00c07.59 kcal/ mol) > EGCG (\u00c07.30 kcal/mol). The electrostatic surface potential of the binding site along with the simultaneous presence of the 17 natural products is shown in Figure S3 .",

It can be seen that the drugs bind to the active site of the SARS-CoV-2. Diethylcarbamazine ( Figure 6a ) interacts with LEU27, MET49 and CYS145 through alkyl hydrophobic interactions and van der Waals interaction with other residues. Primaquine (Figure 6b ) forms hydrogen bond with CYS44 residue along with p-sulphur interaction with CYS145 and van der Waals interaction with other residues. Mepacrine (Figure 6c ) undergoes alkyl hydrophobic interactions with CYS145 and MET165 residues, p-alkyl hydrophobic interactions with HIS163, MET165, MET49, and van der Waals interaction with other residues. Similarly, artemisinin ( Figure 6d ) undergoes alkyl hydrophobic interaction with MET49 and CYS145 residues along with p-alkyl interactions with HIS163. Niclosamide (Figure 6e) , forms a hydrogen bond with GLY143, p-sigma and p-sulphur interactions with GLN189 and MET165, respectively, alkyl hydrophobic interactions with LEU167 and PRO168, p-alkyl interaction with CYS145. The anti-protozoal drug, emetine undergoes attractive electrostatic (salt bridge) interaction with GLU166, alkyl hydrophobic interaction with MET49, and Met165, p-alkyl interaction with PRO168 ( Figure 6f ). On comparison of the estimated DG values from Table 1 for the five anti-nematodes and one anti-protozoal, we observe that emetine has the most negative DG value (\u00c09.07 kcal/mol), followed by mepacrine (\u00c07.80 kcal/mol), primaquine(\u00c07.45 kcal/mol), artemisinin (\u00c07.15 kcal/mol) and finally niclosamide (\u00c06.77 kcal/mol). The electrostatic surface potential of the binding site along with the simultaneous presence of the six drugs is shown in Figure S6 . Herein, the blind molecular docking studies carried out for a total of 33 compounds under different categories reveal that they might act as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs, as these molecules bind to the active site of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 M pro . Inhibition of this enzyme/protease is essential for blocking the viral replication . This inhibitor binding site within the protease of SARS-CoV-2 consists of residues HIS41, MET49, GLY143, CYS145, HIS163, HIS164, GLU166, PRO168, and GLN189 as evident from the recent study on the a-ketoamide inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 main protease . We observe from the blind docking study of all the 33 molecules with the SARS-CoV-2 protease that the molecules are generally surrounded by the above mentioned residues, which clearly suggests that this molecule can prevent the viral replication of SARS-CoV-2. The distance of the ligands along with the change in accessible area of the two important catalytic residues (HIS41 and CYS145) within the active site of the protease is shown in Table 2 . Although the blind docking studies indicates that all the molecules can act as potential agents for COVID treatments, but from the estimated free energy of binding (DG) values (Table 1) , we can infer that rutin with the highest negative minimum DG value (\u00c09.55 kcal/mol) among all the studied compounds can be the best possible SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor, followed by ritonavir (\u00c09.52 kcal/mol), emetine (\u00c09.07 kcal/mol), hesperidin (\u00c09.02 kcal/mol), and indinavir (\u00c08.84 kcal/mol).",

In recent years, molecules that influence the life cycle of viruses have been identified, and a broad range of anti-viral agents have been proposed, which includes inhibiting the entry and stopping of viral replication or targeting intracellular signal transduction pathways (Elfiky & Azzam, 2020; Hasan et al., 2020) . In this context, repurposing of already known drugs and molecules is an essential concept (R. J. , especially in the pandemic that has resulted due to the novel coronavirus, as it is cost-effective in terms of research and development of new novel drug molecules. Sir James Black, the recipient of the 1988 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine, had famously stated that \"The most fruitful basis for the discovery of a new drug is to start with an old drug\". In addition to the FDA approved drugs, here we observed that rutin and hesperidin, two dietary polyphenols have significant potential to function as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M pro . Dietary polyphenols have low systemic toxicity and are highly beneficial for human health (Cory et al., 2018) . Rutin, also known as vitamin P, has several pharmacological properties including anti-viral activity (Ganeshpurkar & Saluja, 2017) . Similarly, hesperidin has also been observed to act as an anti-viral compound (Parvez et al., 2019) . Therefore, this finding also indicates a promising potential for the use of dietary polyphenols for the treatment of COVID-19.",

We observe that the studied bind within the active site of the 6Y84, the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, which is essential for preventing the protein mutarotation of the virus by inhibiting the viral replication, and further spread of the infection. The estimated free energy of binding varied in the range of -6.57 to -9.55 kcal/mol, suggesting the molecules can spontaneously interact within the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 M pro . Among all the molecules, the inhibition activity of rutin was found to be the highest as its DG value (\u00c09.55 kcal/mol) is the minimum, followed by ritonavir (\u00c09.52 kcal/mol), emetine (\u00c09.07 kcal/mol), hesperidin (\u00c09.02 kcal/mol), and indinavir (\u00c08.84 kcal/mol). As this study has been carried out using computational methods, therefore being particular about these results would require further wet-lab experiments to be carried out under in vivo as well as in vitro conditions.",
