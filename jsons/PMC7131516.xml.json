Furthermore, the study of natural bioactive compounds obtained from marine organisms is a relatively new field of research (since the \u201990s), with enormous scientific potential (Cakmak et al., 2014, Mehadi et al., 2015). Given that oceans cover three quarters of the Earth\u2019s surface, these marine organisms are of potential interest not only as ingredients for the production of food but also as practical and necessary metabolites with medical and technological properties, such as lipids, enzymes, biomass, polymers, toxins, pigments, and clean fuel, which can be produced, concentrated, and successfully isolated from these small but efficient \u201cmarine bioreactors\u201d. These organisms are a viable and economical source for the production of these substances, and are in great demand in the nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, chemical, food, and cosmetic industries because of their moisturizing, antioxidant, and regenerative properties (Batista et al., 2013, Devi et al., 2008, Rani et al., 2013). The possibility of an efficient and sustainable use of marine resources offers an important way of providing staple food, animal feed, pharmacological products, functional ingredients, and medical solutions for a global population that is rapidly increasing.",

The algae group is divided into multicellular organisms, MACROALGAE or seaweed, and unicellular organisms, known as MICROALGAE (measuring from 1 \u00b5m to several cm). Macroalgae are often fast-growing, reaching sizes of up to 60 m in length. A standard classification has been established, dividing seaweed organisms into three groups on the basis of their pigmentation: i) brown seaweed (Phaeophyceae); ii) red seaweed (Rhodophyceae) and iii) green seaweed (Chlorophyceae). Seaweeds are mainly used for the production of food and the extraction of hydrocolloids. On the other hand, microalgae are microscopic bodies that normally grow in suspension, some with features characteristic of bacteria. These algae grow in seawater, in the region where light penetrates (photic zone), basically up to a depth of 200 meters. Diatoms (Bacillariophyceae), green algae (Chlorophyceae), and golden algae (Chrysophyceae) are the most important microalgae in terms of abundance, but blue-green algae (Cyanophyceae) are also classified as microalgae (e.g. Spirulina) (Guedes et al., 2011).",

France, Ireland, Canada, and the United States are particularly active in introducing seaweed into local cuisine, and the movement is spreading to cookery books that include recipes with algae as the main ingredient (FAO, 2012). Consumers have a good perception of algae as \u201cnatural products\u201d, like lettuce, chard, or broccoli, with well-known, accepted health benefits (Honkanen, 2009). Humans have certainly been consuming algae for years: pet foods, baby foods, dairy products, instant soups, meat coatings (cooked ham), and many others commodities are clear examples of the presence of seaweed in our daily diet. Nowadays, most of these algae ingredients correspond to EU labeled additives E-406, E-401, E-402, E-403, and E-404 (Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008).",

In this field, algae take a high position among the raw materials proposed as alternative protein sources, together with soy, beans, grains, and, recently, insects (FAO, 2016). Algae protein quality has been considered superior to that of other plant sources, such as wheat, rice, or beans, but poorer than that of animal protein sources, such as milk or meat (Mendes, Lopes da Silva, & Reis, 2007). However, interest in marine proteins might be directly correlated not only with intact protein but also with the possibility of generating bioactive peptides. Small peptides are generally considered to be the most ancient antimicrobial agents because of their ubiquity and simple molecular structure. In general, bioactive peptides comprise relatively small molecules (<10 kDa, or 12\u201350 amino acids) that do not present any bioactivity prior to being released from the intact parent protein. However, in various processes such as digestion or in vivo hydrolysis, or as a result of application of technological treatments such as high pressure processing, these peptides demonstrate many physiological functions, including antioxidant, antihypertensive or ACE inhibition, anticoagulant, and antimicrobial properties (Ngo, Wijesekara, Vo, Ta, & Kim, 2011). Antimicrobial peptides are recognized as being divided into three groups: (i) linear \u03b1-helical peptides; (ii) cysteine-rich peptides; (iii) certain amino-acid-enriched peptides. Critical factors affecting the antibacterial activity and modes of action of antimicrobial peptides are size, charge, conformation/secondary structure, hydrophobicity, and origin (animal/plant or marine) (Aneiros & Garateix, 2004).",

The antimicrobial activity of lectins obtained from red algae against some clinical microorganisms was also observed by Alves-Vasconcelos et al. (2014). Although the way in which lectins act against bacteria is not well defined, Paiva et al.

Polysaccharides are some of the most important constituents of seaweed (Kraan, 2012). Phaeophyta, or brown algae, are specifically rich in polysaccharides, including alginates, laminarins, fucans, and cellulose. Chlorophyta, or green algae, are mainly composed of ulvan. The principal polysaccharides found in Rhodophyta, or red algae, are agars and carrageenans. These polysaccharides obtained from algae have been related to positive effects on gut microbiota, acting as prebiotics, a prebiotic being a \u201cselectively fermented ingredient that allows specific changes, both in the composition and/or in the activity of the gastrointestinal microflora, that confers benefits upon host well-being and health\u201d. Reduction of enteric infections in pigs and cattle is possible by means of administration of prebiotic compounds in the diet which promote the activity and proliferation of beneficial gastrointestinal microflora to the detriment of pathogenic bacteria (Uyeno, Shigemori, & Shimosato, 2015). The use of marine algal prebiotics as sources to control and reduce pathogenic bacteria and to improve animal and human health is another possibility that this line of research offers (Promya & Chitmanat, 2011). The polysaccharide ulvan is easily extracted from Ulva rigida, and could be hydrolyzed to produce bioactive oligosaccharides (Mi\u0161urcov\u00e1, \u0160krov\u00e1nkov\u00e1, Samek, Ambro\u017eov\u00e1, & Mach\u016f, 2012).

Additionally, some operations such as ultrafiltration processes are added to enhance selectivity. Other methods use ethanol in a first step to precipitate protein, followed by a second stage extraction with hexane, butanol, or ethyl acetate. Recent studies show that it is possible to use ternary mixtures of solvents (ethanol\u2013hexane\u2013water [77:17:6]) to form a homogeneous solution, with the advantage of significantly increasing the extraction yield and purity of the compounds extracted by a single stage, based on the high solubility of the compounds in the extractant mixture (Parniakov et al., 2015). The antimicrobial potential of algae extracts is dependent on the capability of the solvent to extract certain bioactive compounds, and also dependent on the sensitiveness of bacteria or fungi to these selective extracted compounds (Al-Saif et al., 2014, Cakmak et al., 2014). In general, these traditional extraction techniques, such as Soxhlet, solid\u2013liquid extraction (SLE), or liquid\u2013liquid extraction (LLE), are time-consuming procedures that use high volumes of solvents and obtain low extraction yields.",

Moreover, according to the studies of Wang et al. (2009), antimicrobial activity from A. nodosum phlorotannins (PTs) against various rumen microbes was observed, and it affected ruminal fermentation. In 2009 they published a new research work in which the bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects of PTs from A. nodosum were evaluated against E. coli O157:H7, and were then compared with the antimicrobial potential of other tannins from terrestrial plant sources. An MIC of 25 \u00b5g/mL was required to inhibit growth of E. coli O157:H7 strains (EDL933 and E318 N) for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C. PT bacteriostatic concentrations of 25 \u03bcg/mL or higher, and a bactericidal concentration \u2265 50 \u03bcg/mL, were required against the E. coli O157:H7 strains studied. According to Ngo et al.

C. linum methanolic 500 \u03bcg/mL extract resulted in a 27 mm inhibition zone against this foodborne pathogen. The total phenolic content (TPC) of the methanolic C. linum extract was determined by means of the Folin\u2013Ciocalteu method, yielding a TPC value equal to 672.3 mg GAE/100 g extract, related to significant antioxidant activity (as ascorbic acid equivalents). The higher scavenging activity of C. linum may be attributed to the structure of phenolic compounds, specifically to hydroxyl groups. Accordingly, it could be said that the antimicrobial potential exerted by this methanolic C. linum extract is closely related to its antioxidant activity as measured by the DPPH method, with the antioxidant potential of the extract being dose-dependent, with an IC50 value of 9.8 \u03bcg/mL.",

Dried algal biomass was sonicated and extracted with 95% methanol and 95% acetone. Extracts were prepared in DMSO for evaluation of antimicrobial activity. Algal extracts from Nostoc spp., Microcystis spp., Scenedesmus spp., and Oscillatoria geminata revealed antifungal activity, and the methanol extract of Nostoc (50 mg/mL) was the most effective one against A. niger, with an inhibition zone diameter of 22 mm. Acetone extract was also effective against A. niger (30 mg/mL), with a 21 mm inhibition zone diameter. An acetone extract of T. conoides also exerted a mild antimicrobial capability against A. niger, with an inhibition zone diameter close to 3 mm (Manivannan et al., 2011). Extracts of Trichodesmium erythraeum (hexane and ethyl acetate 5 mg/disc) were also effective against A. niger and A. flavus. In a comparison of the hexane and ethyl acetate extracts, the latter had a higher antifungal potential than the hexane algal extract. Ethyl acetate extract of T. erythraeum inhibited growth of A. niger and A. flavus at 1000 \u00b5g/mL (Thillairajasekar, Duraipandiyan, Perumal, & Ignacimuthu, 2009). Both extracts are rich in myristic, oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids. There is an established relationship between the richness in polyunsaturated fatty acids (lauric, palmitic, linoleic, linolenic, stearic, and myristic) of algal extracts and the antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal potential exerted by them (El Shoubaky & El Rahman-Salem, 2014).",

            "text": "However, with regard to preservation there is scarce literature about validating the functionality of these ingredients as antimicrobials in real food matrices (Gupta et al., 2010, S\u0103l\u0103gean et al., 2015). Although some researchers are making efforts to introduce raw algae and processed materials in the formulation of innovative meat-derived products (e.g. sausages and hamburgers), some aspects such as quality and organoleptic acceptance of the final formulation still need to be analyzed in depth. With regard to the validation of the antimicrobial potential of algae in meat products, a noteworthy study has recently been published by S\u0103l\u0103gean et al. (2015). Among the main advantages that the introduction of algae in meat-formulated products aims at are the following: (a) the introduction of a protein source of vegetable origin, (b) lower content of cholesterol, calories and fat in the finished products, and the associated (c) beneficial bioactive compounds present in algae-derived ingredients. According to the results obtained by S\u0103l\u0103gean et al. (2015), in the formulation of half-smoked sausages (75% first-quality beef, [10\u201315]% animal fat, and brown algae [10\u201315]%) the addition of algae in the formulation led to a final product with higher quality (physicochemical and organoleptic), with improved functionality resulting from the antimicrobial potential of brown algae against S. aureus and E. coli (storage 7 days, 10\u201312 \u00b0C). Furthermore, a recent industrial patent has been obtained for the introduction of algae in meat-derived products. According to Cofrades et al. (2011), a new method for the formulation of healthier meat products has been developed, incorporating less than 5 wt.% of Himanhatalia elongata brown alga. Brown algae are more suitable for meat formulations than red or green algae, not only because of their nutritional profile but also because of the color balance between animal tissue (cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, horses, poultry) and these pigmented algae. The result shows a reduction in sodium levels and an improvement in the lipid profile of the final product (Cofrades et al., 2011).",

According to S\u00e1nchez-Ortega et al. (2014), the addition of edible algae films and coatings on meat products had the following main advantages: reduction of lipid oxidation, increase in stability of red meat color, prevention of moisture loss, reduction of spoilage and pathogenic microorganism load, and partial inactivation of deteriorative proteolytic enzymes on the surface of the coated meat. The development of red algae films applied to bacon impacted positively on the microbiological quality of the product reducing E. coli O157:H7 by 0.45 log CFU/g and L. monocytogenes by 0.76 CFU/g with respect to the controls. The application of edible coatings from algae to cheese also reduced E. coli O157:H7 and L. monocytogenes populations by 1.21 and 0.85 log CFU/g, respectively, compared with the control after 15 days of storage (Shin et al., 2012, S\u00e1nchez-Ortega et al., 2014).

The promising results of bacterial growth inhibition and inactivation by raw and purified algal compounds, and the lack of studies carried out in real food matrices open a research niche with high application at food industrial level. A valuable relationship could be established between the antioxidant potential of algae and their antimicrobial capability.
