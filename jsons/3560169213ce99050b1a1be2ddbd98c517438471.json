In our initial calculation of sample size, we postulated that a minimum sensitivity of 80% would be adequate in some contexts. For example, if an influenza pandemic occurred, throat swab specimens could be rapidly obtained by personnel with minimal training, and the 83% sensitivity of testing of throat swab specimens that was demonstrated in our study would likely be considered to be adequate. It is unfortunate that the yield of testing of saliva specimens was !80%, because saliva specimens could be obtained at home by parents or, in the case of older children, by the individuals themselves. This would prevent the need for physician visits for patients with milder illness and would decrease the chance of influenza being transmitted in physician offices or emergency departments, while still leading to appropriate use of antiviral medication in the majority of cases.
