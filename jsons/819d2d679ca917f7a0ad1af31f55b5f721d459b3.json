Conventional perfusion analysis performs a deconvolution of the measurements and thresholds the perfusion parameters to determine the tissue status. We pursue a data-driven and deconvolution-free approach, where a deep neural network learns to predict the final infarct volume directly from the native CTP images and metadata such as the time parameters and treatment. This would allow clinicians to simulate various treatments and gain insight into predicted tissue status over time. We demonstrate on a multicenter dataset that our approach is able to predict the final infarct and effectively uses the metadata. An ablation study shows that using the native CTP measurements instead of the deconvolved measurements improves the prediction.",

Due to the reduction in perfusion, neuronal functioning is impaired and if perfusion is not re-established, brain tissue becomes irreversibly damaged. Acute treatment aims at reopening the blocked artery through treatment with intra-venous trombolytics and/or mechanical thrombectomy. Since both treatment options entail considerable costs and side effects (e.g. increased risk of haemorrhage), selection of patients who might benefit is important. In early studies, patient selection was mainly based on the time since stroke onset; e.g. intravenous trombolysis with tPA is shown to be beneficial within 4.5 hours (Hacke et al., 2008) . Recent studies typically select patients based on both time parameters and advanced neuroimaging, allowing patient-specific assessment of the benefits and risk of treatment.",

            "text": "One commonly used imaging modality for acute stroke diagnosis is CT Perfusion (CTP), which consists of a series of 3D CT scans acquired after intra-venous injection of contrast agent. The resulting 4D image shows the passage of contrast agent through the brain: in each spatial voxel we have a time-attenuation curve showing the variation of intensity due to the contrast agent. Much research has gone into the quantification of these images, particularly aiming at the estimation of perfusion parameters such as cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV) and Tmax. The most used approach for perfusion analysis works as follows (Fieselmann et al., 2011) . First the time-attenuation curves are converted to time-concentration curves that show the concentration of contrast agent over time. In CTP, there is a linear relationship between the change in attenuation and the concentration. Then an arterial input function (AIF) is determined: this is the timeconcentration curve in one of the large feeding arteries of the brain. Subsequently, the time-concentration curve in each voxel is deconvolved with the AIF, resulting in deconvolved timeconcentration curves. These curves correspond to what would have been measured if the contrast bolus was infinitely short and infinitely concentrated in the feeding artery -indeed, these curves are impulse response functions (IRF). As such, the deconvolved time-concentration curves are no longer influenced by the contrast injection protocol or the cardiac system of the particular patient. Finally, under some reasonable assumptions, the perfusion parameters can be derived from these curves. For example CBF \u221d max t IRF(t) and Tmax = argmax t IRF(t).",

            "text": "The deconvolution operation plays a central role in current perfusion analysis. However, deconvolution depends crucially on the accurate selection of an AIF. Additionally, deconvolution is a mathematically ill-posed problem and that is problematic given the low signal to noise ratio of perfusion images (Fieselmann et al., 2011) . Perfusion analysis software accounts for this by preprocessing the images and by regularizing the deconvolution. The preprocessing mainly aims at reducing the noise through motion correction, temporal and spatial smoothing, and possibly spatial downsampling. The regularization of the deconvolution suppresses the high frequency signal in the reconstructed impulse response function. This can be done in singular value decomposition (SVD) based deconvolution by regularizing the singular values, e.g. using Tikhonov regularization. Nevertheless, the deconvolution-based perfusion parameters remain noise sensitive and research for improved algorithms (Boutelier et al., 2012) or even deconvolution-free summary parameters (Meijs et al., 2016) remains ongoing.",

The infarct growth rate differs between patients (Wheeler et al., 2015; Guenego et al., 2018) . It depends on factors such as the location of the thrombus and the patient's vascular connectivity: there is considerable inter-subject variation in the amount of vascular redundancy and hence in the amount collateral blood supply to the affected region (Liebeskind, 2003) . Knowledge about the growth rate of the core is of clinical importance, as it allows assessment of the relevance of transferring a patient to a comprehensive stroke center depending on transport time. Hence it is valuable to not only predict core and penumbra from an acute CTP scan, but also how the core would evolve over time. Additionally, not every mechanical thrombectomy procedure achieves complete reperfusion. Although a more complete recanalization is arguably always bet-ter (Kleine et al., 2017) , it is interesting to take this into account in the model as it might give interventional radiologists information about the added value of an additional attempt after a partial recanalization.",

The prediction takes into account not only the CTP measurements, but also the treatment parameters such as the time-to-recanalization and the completeness of recanalization. Once the network is trained, it can make predictions for new patients based on hypothetical treatment schemes. This allows to predict the ischemic core at baseline (i.e. the predicted final infarct in case of an immediate perfect recanalization), the perfusion lesion (i.e. the predicted final infarct in case of no recanalization) or any intermediate scenario. The latter can be relevant if e.g. we first need to transfer the patient and achieve recanalization at a particular later time point. This provides clinicians with additional information on the impact of potential treatment options. We show that our method takes this information effectively into account resulting in better predictions.",

            "text": "Various works have suggested to use more advanced machine learning techniques to predict core and penumbra. Most of them use MR imaging which usually consists of two modalities: MR Perfusion, which is similar to CTP, and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) (Wu et al., 2001; Scalzo et al., 2012; McKinley et al., 2017; Nielsen et al., 2018) . The latter modality gives a clear signal regarding the viability of tissue and is considered the golden standard to identify ischemic tissue, making the prediction of final infarct easier than using only perfusion information. With the advent of mechanical thrombectomy, accurate determination of the time of recanalization became possible and this parameter was introduced in models. D'Esterre et al. (2015) investigated the influence of the time between onset and imaging and the time between imaging and recanalization, finding that the former does not and the latter does influence the optimal perfusion parameters thresholds to determine the final infarct. Kemmling et al. (2015) proposed a multivariate generalized linear model that predicts the final infarct in a voxelwise fashion based on CTP perfusion parameters and clinical parameters including a binary recanalization status and the onset-to-recanalization duration. It was trained and crossvalidated on 161 subjects that underwent CTP imaging and mechanical thrombectomy. In a similar vein, the ISLES 2016 & 2017 challenges (Winzeck et al., 2018) invited researchers to evaluate methods that predict the final infarct based on acute DWI and MR Perfusion imaging. The organizers provided publicly available training data and a blinded test set for the validation. The challenge showed the competitive advantage of deep neural networks.",

            "text": "All approaches discussed so far depend on deconvolution as a first step, but there has been some work to avoid explicit deconvolution. On one hand we can distinguish alternative perfusion parameters that do not require deconvolution, such as the first moment of the time-concentration curve (Christensen et al., 2009 ). On the other hand, we see approaches that aim at replacing the traditional deconvolution analysis with a learned alternative (Ho et al., 2016; Hess et al., 2018) . However, this approach seems to beg the question, since during training the ground truth perfusion parameters are provided by deconvolution analysis. In our approach -starting from the native images and optimizing the network for the best final infarct prediction -the optimal features and how to calculate them is inferred directly from the data. The disadvantage of this approach is that those features no longer have a clear physiological interpretation such as the perfusion parameters have, but depending on the application, this might be a price worth paying. Recently Pinto et al. (2018) proposed a method for the ISLES 2017 challenge that uses, apart from the DWI image and the perfusion parameters, also the native MR perfusion measurements to predict the final infarct. They show that their method benefits from the native measurements, but the obtained results are not as good as other state-of-the-art approaches that did not include native measurements, making it hard to assess the added value of the native measurements. The method did not take the reperfusion status or other treatment data into account, presumably because the dataset was fairly homogenous, consisting of mostly early reperfused patients.",

During preprocessing, we account for both aspects, aiming to reduce the unnecessary variation that the network need to cope with. First, if the CTP was acquired with gantry tilt, the CTP images are resampled to an orthogonal grid that has the same x-y plane and an orthogonalized z-axis. Second, the CTP scan is motion corrected by rigidly aligning the volumes with the first volume. Registration is performed using Elastix, optimizing for the sum of squared differences. Finally, the images are spatially downsampled to 1.5 x 1.5 x 4 mm 3 and temporally resampled to one image per two seconds. The rationale is that the original high spatial resolution might help the registrations, whereas for the perfusion analysis, which has a notoriously low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), a high resolution would only slow down processing. If the CTP was acquired in shuttle mode, i.e. with the patient continuously moving back and forth in the scanner resulting in variable scan times per CTP volume, we account for this and resample the time series such that each volume corresponds to a single time point.",

This input is fed into a pathway consisting of 6 convolutional layers: three layers with 48 filters of 3x3x1 and three layers with 64 filters of 3x3x3. The second input is the downsampled CTP. The image is downsampled with a factor 3 in plane, resulting in voxels of 4.5 x 4.5 x 4 mm 3 and which provides the network a wider spatial context to base its prediction on. This second input's pathway has the same architecture as the first one and is followed by an upsampling operation to recover the original resolution. The third input is the arterial input function (AIF), which is a one dimensional vector. This pathway consists of 2 convolution layers, each with 48 filters of 1x1x1, and an upsampling operation.

However, this has no influence on the actual tissue perfusion status or the viability of the tissue. If the concentration of the iodine in the contrast agent were a fraction higher or lower, the concentration curves would change with the same fraction. But again, this has no impact on the tissue status. Hence, we augment our training dataset by applying a random time shift (earlier or later) and a random scaling of the attenuation variation. The shift is randomly chosen between -4 and 6 time points (since our measurements are discrete) and the scaling has a log normal distribution between with \u00b5 of 0 and \u03c3 of 0.3.",

This is not an image segmentation task, where all the relevant information is contained in the input, but a prediction problem with a ground truth that is defined on images acquired several days later. For example, the ISLES 2017 challenge (Winzeck et al., 2018) has a similar goal, namely predicting the final infarct from acute DWI and MR perfusion imaging, and reported a mean Dice score of 0.32 the best result. Of course, a direct comparison between these values is not possible since the ISLES challenge had different modalities (with especially the DWI imaging being very informative compared to perfusion imaging) and a different population (mostly early successful early recanalization, which results in small lesions and hence lower Dice scores), but it illustrates the difficulty of the problem. Table 1 shows the mean Dice, soft Dice and absolute volume error of the proposed method and of the various ablated variants. It shows a gradual decrease in performance, both for removing the spatial context as for working on the deconvolved data. The beneficial effect of taking context into account is expected. Perfusion imaging is a noisy modality and suffers from artifacts which results in -often visually -erroneous predictions. In some clinical studies, the results given by the conventional voxelwise perfusion analysis are manually corrected. We hypothesize that a human rater is able to do so, because she takes spatial context into account. By providing spatial context, the network is able to do this as well, which greatly improves results: the mean Dice score more than triples and the volume error drops almost 20%.",

It can be argued that, if we have a correct physical model, there is no need to re-learn that model a second time from our own limited training data. From the perspective of physics, deconvolution is the right way to approach the problem. However, the way that deconvolution should be regularized is not dictated by physics. We hypothesize that a neural network can do deconvolution better as it has a learned model of the noise and concentration curve shape. We showed this earlier on simulated data and see this now confirmed on real data: using the native data instead of the deconvolved data improved the mean Dice score significantly from 0.42 to 0.48.

However, if the AIF is an input to the network, it becomes possible to let the network learn to select the AIF from an input patch and have the AIF selection optimized in an end-to-end fashion, such as was explored by Hess et al.

(2017) report that between these time points the median infarct volume increases from 42 ml to 64 ml and more than half of the subjects witness more 30% relative growth. This means that there is variability on our ground truth, purely due to the moment of follow-up acquisition. Part of this volume increase is likely due to genuine delayed tissue death and part is due to edema, which is most pronounced at 3 to 5 days after the stroke. Finally, the brain edema increases the volume of the final infarct, and hence might result in overestimated core and penumbra volumes even though we tried to correct for this by non-rigid registration and CSF exclusion.",
