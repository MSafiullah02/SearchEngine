Given the lack of effective antivirals, we investigated the potential for immunotherapeutic intervention, using adoptively transferred T cells. Thus, we characterized the cellular immune response to the virus and identified F, N, M2-1, M, and P as immunodominant target antigens. Reactive T cells were polyclonal (ie, they expressed CD4 and CD8), T-helper type 1 polarized, and polyfunctional (ie, they produced interferon \u03b3, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and granzyme B), and they were able to kill autologous antigen-loaded targets. The detection of hMPV-specific T cells in HSCT recipients who endogenously controlled active infections support the clinical importance of T-cell immunity in mediating protective antiviral effects. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of developing an immunotherapy for immunocompromised patients with uncontrolled infections.",

Adenovirus has also proven susceptible to this approach [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, it is increasingly apparent that infections with other seasonal viruses, such as human metapneumovirus (hMPV), are clinically problematic, result in prolonged hospitalization, and can be fatal, such as when the virus progresses from an upper to a lower respiratory tract infection. Hence, the goal of the current study was to explore the potential for targeting hMPV with an immunotherapeutic approach.",

There are currently no approved preventive vaccines nor antiviral drugs, and although the nucleoside analog ribavirin (with or without intravenous immunoglobulin) has been used therapeutically, results have been inconsistent, with considerable associated toxicities (eg, hemolytic anemia and cytopenias) [23, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] .",

Furthermore, we show that T cells reactive for these immunogenic antigens can be readily expanded ex vivo, exhibit a polyclonal, T-helper type 1 (Th1)-polarized profile, and can kill antigenexpressing targets.

Thus, we exposed PBMCs from 29 healthy individuals (age range, 21-59 years; mean age [\u00b1SEM], 32 \u00b1 1.6 years) to a mastermix of the hMPV peptide libraries and allowed reactive T cells to expand for 9-11 days. Overall, we achieved a mean fold-increase (\u00b1SEM) 4.3 \u00b1 0.2 in total cell numbers (n = 29; Figure 2A) , and the expanded populations comprised CD3 + T cells (91.7% \u00b1 1%), with a mix of cytotoxic (CD8 + ) T cells (29.5% \u00b1 2.3%) and helper (CD4 + ) T cells (61.8% \u00b1 2.3%; Figure 2B ), with no evidence of regulatory T-cell outgrowth, as assessed by CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + staining (Supplementary Figure 1) Figure 2B ). To next determine whether we had enriched for hMPV-reactive cells, we assessed specificity by the IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT assay, and, as shown in Figure 3A , we were readily able to expand populations that were specific for all antigens except M2-2. The fold enrichment achieved is summarized in Figure 3B . These data suggest that hMPV-specific T cells reside in the memory pool and can be readily amplified ex vivo. We then sought to identify a hierarchy of immunodominance based on (1) the number of donors who positively responded to each antigen (\u226530 SFCs/2 \u00d7 10 5 cells) and (2) the magnitude of the response (based on the absolute number of IFN-\u03b3-producing SFCs per 2 \u00d7 10 5 input cells; Table 1 ). F was recognized by 28 of 29 donors screened (97%) and induced the highest frequency of specific cells (mean [\u00b1SEM], 300 \u00b1 52 SFCs/2 \u00d7 10 5 input cells), followed, in descending order, by N (218 \u00b1 28; n = 25), M2-1 and M (167 \u00b1 21 and 154 \u00b1 24, respectively; n = 23 for both), P (130 \u00b1 24; n = 20), L (125 \u00b1 21.7; n = 13), and G (62 \u00b1 18; n = 9). Reactivity against SH was detected in only 1 donor screened (34 SFCs/2 \u00d7 10 5 input cells), whereas M2-2 was not immunogenic. Notably, the majority of donors screened recognized \u22655 of the expressed antigens ( Figure 3C ). Thus, for subsequent functional studies, we chose to focus on the top 5 immunogenic target antigens (F, N, M2-1, M, and P).",

For all 5 antigens, specificity, as determined by production of either cytokine, was detected predominantly in the CD4 + T-cell compartment, with a minor CD8-reactive component. Figure 4A shows fluorescence-activated cell-sorting data from a representative donor, while Figure 4C summarizes data from all 14 donors studied. Production of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and effector molecules has been reported to correlate with enhanced cytolytic function and improved in vivo activity. Thus, we comprehensively explored the functional profile of our expanded VSTs and found that the majority of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells ( Figure 5A ) also produced TNF-\u03b1 (detailed results from 1 donor are shown in Figure 4B ; data for 14 donors are summarized in Figure 4D ).

Since her symptoms had resolved by day 5 before transplant receipt, her myeloablative transplantation proceeded on schedule, but hMPV remained detectable by RVP PCR until day 45 after transplantation. To assess whether reconstituting hMPV-specific T cells contributed to viral clearance, we collected blood specimens before and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks after HSCT receipt and measured specific T-cell activity. As shown in Figure 6C , this patient exhibited strong T-cell activity as early as 3 weeks after transplantation, which subsequently declined coincident with viral clearance. We were able to detect similar patterns of T-cell activity in 3 additional transplant recipients with confirmed hMPV infections that were cleared.

            "text": "In this study, we characterized the T-cell immune response against all 9 virally encoded hMPV antigens and, based on both the frequency of responding donors and the magnitude of reactive cells, were able to define a hierarchy of immunodominance, with F being the most immunogenic, followed in descending order by N, M2-1, M, P, L, G, and SH; M2-2 was not immunogenic. Reactive T cells could be readily enriched in vitro and were polyclonal, Th1-polarized, polyfunctional (producing IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, GM-CSF, and granzyme B), and able to kill autologous antigen-loaded target cells. Finally, the potential for clinical benefit following the adoptive transfer of such cells was inferred by the detection of reactive T-cell populations in the peripheral blood of allogeneic HSCT recipients who successfully cleared active hMPV infections. The lack of effective treatments for hMPV in immunocompromised patients led our group to investigate the potential for using adoptively transferred donor-derived T cells to prevent and/or treat hMPV infections, given the success of this approach against other clinically problematic viruses, including cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, BK virus, human herpesvirus 6, and adenovirus [9] . Thus, we first sought to identify appropriate hMPV antigens against which an effector T-cell response might be generated. Prior to the current study, there was limited information on immunity to hMPV, although there is some evidence to suggest the importance of cell-mediated over humoral antiviral activity. For example, in immunocompromised individuals (eg, human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients and steroid-treated HSCT recipients), hMPV infections can be severe and sometimes fatal [23, [34] [35] [36] , and treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin has not proven beneficial [23, 30] . In murine studies, Kolli et al intranasally infected BALB/c mice with a laboratory strain of hMPV (CAN97-83) or exposed animals to UV-inactivated hMPV and demonstrated that the depletion of either CD4 + or CD8 + T cells compromised the animals' ability to control/clear the viral challenge [37] . Similarly, Hastings et al vaccinated HLA-A2 transgenic C57BL/6 mice with either an hMPV M-derived CD8 + T-cell epitope or irrelevant control, challenged them with a live hMPV strain (TN/94-49), and demonstrated that the viral load in the lungs of vaccinated animals was significantly lower than that for control mice [38] . Finally, Herd et al demonstrated that T cells with an effector profile, characterized by production of both prototypic Th1 cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, GM-CSF, and interleukin 12) and proinflammatory chemokines (macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3-inducible protein 10), were able to accumulate at the lung following hMPV infection [39] . However, since immune studies of human viruses performed in animals do not always faithfully recapitulate studies performed in the natural host, we sought to analyze the T-cell response to hMPV in healthy human subjects and hMPV-infected HSCT recipients. We initiated our studies in healthy adults and discovered that the frequency of circulating hMPV-reactive T cells was at or below the threshold of our detection assay (IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT). However, reactive cells could readily be expanded to numbers that were clinically relevant [7, 9, 40] with a single in vitro stimulation.",

Finally, to establish the feasibility of using adoptively transferred T cells as a prophylactic or therapeutic approach in immunocompromised patients, we demonstrate that hMPV-reactive T cells with a Th1-polarized effector profile can be successfully expanded to clinically relevant numbers in vitro by means of manufacturing approaches compliant with good manufacturing practice. Taken together, these studies support the development of a future clinical trial of adoptively transferred hMPV-specific T cells specific for either prophylactic or therapeutic use in immunocompromised patients.",

PHA (1 \u03bcg/mL) and staphylococcal enterotoxin B (1 \u03bcg/mL) served as positive controls for VSTs and PBMCs, respectively, while unstimulated cells served as a negative control. Each condition was run in duplicate, and results were considered positive if the frequency of reactive cells was \u226530 spot-forming cells (SFCs; defined as our potency threshold). After 20 hours of incubation, plates were developed as previously described, dried overnight at room temperature in the dark, and sent to Zellnet Consulting (New York, NY) for quantification. SFC and input cell numbers were plotted.The hMPV-specific T-cell cytokine profile was assessed using the Milliplex High Sensitivity Human Cytokine Panel (Millipore, Billerica, MA) per the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 2 \u00d7 10 5 VSTs were stimulated using N, P, M, F, or M2-1 pepmixes (200 ng/pepmix/well) overnight. Subsequently, supernatant was collected, plated in duplicate wells, incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with antibody-immobilized beads, and washed and plated for 1 hour at room temperature with biotinylated detection antibodies. Finally, streptavidin-phycoerythrin was added for 30 minutes at room temperature. Samples were washed and analyzed on a Luminex 200 (XMAP Technology), using xPonent software.",
