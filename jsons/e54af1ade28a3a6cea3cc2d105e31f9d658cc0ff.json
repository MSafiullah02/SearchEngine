In Chap. 7, we explained that limited resources need to focus on high-risk groups and locations to achieve the best possible results. However, as we showed in the sex workers, who are the source of almost 80% of HIV infections, a negligible amount of funding for HIV/AIDS is targeted at this group. The mismatch between the most affected group and the allocation of funding in Ghana highlights the importance of matching funding to prevailing prevalence and transmission patterns in a given country or region. As we saw in Chap. 2, an HIV prevalence rate above 1% is a key threshold for an HIV epidemic to run out of control unless funding for prevention efforts is targeted at high-risk groups, such as commercial sex workers, men who have sex with men, injection drug users and prisoners. However, in Chap. 8 we saw that PEPFAR -the largest bilateral donor of funding for HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries -prohibits the use of funding for programs for commercial sex workers and needle exchange programs. In Chap. 3, we saw that African-Americans make up 54% of HIV/AIDS patients, even though African-Americans account for less than 15% of the US population. Moreover, black men who have sex with men (MSM) have the highest rates of unrecognized HIV infection, HIV prevalence and incidence rates and AIDS mortality rates among MSM in the United States. In five US cities, 46% of African-American MSM are infected with HIV. HIV and AIDS prevalence rates have affected black MSM disproportionately since the beginning of the epidemic. Black MSM are the only group in the United States with HIV prevalence and incidence rates that are comparable to those in the most affected developing countries. However, the vast majority of HIV prevention intervention for African-Americans does not target homosexual men and for homosexual men does not target black MSM (Millett and Peterson 2007) . Thus, the need to focus prevention efforts on the most vulnerable groups remains an issue not just in developing countries.",

The resources for prevention need to be focused according to the specific nature of the epidemic in different settings, as we showed in Chap. 2. Figure 9 .2 shows the source of new HIV infections by region. Table 9 .2 summarizes the coverage levels of several essential prevention strategies and Fig. 9 .3 shows their deployment by region. It is important to emphasize that prevention and treatment are mutually supportive and need to be addressed simultaneously. Access to treatment supports prevention by reducing risky behaviors, increasing disclosure of HIV status, reducing stigma and reducing infectiousness (Global HIV Prevention Working Group 2007) .

The effectiveness of these strategies varies. The promotion of condoms has been largely successful with respect to commercial sex and casual sex, but condom use remains low within marriage. As we noted in Chap. 4, increasing life expectancy, in areas where it is low due to diseases like malaria, is a cost effective strategy for enhancing behavioral change to lower the risk of HIV infection. A survey by the WHO, on behalf of the Global Fund, reviewed anti-malaria operations in Ethiopia, Ghana, Rwanda and Zambia. In Ethiopia, childhood malaria declined by 60% and the death rate was cut in half within 2 years of the beginning of the mass distribution of mosquito nets. Within a single year, both cases and deaths dropped by twodeaths by a third. In many cases, the distribution of free nets was accompanied by free drugs based on artemisinin, a substance to which the malarial parasite has yet to develop widespread resistance, and spraying DDT inside people's houses. free nets and malaria drugs would bring malaria under control in most of Africa at a cost of USD 10 billion (Economist 2008) .

PEPFAR guidelines also undermine HIV/AIDS prevention by further stigmatizing sex workers and prohibiting funding of needle exchange programs, despite evidence that such harm reduction programs are effective. The PEPFAR approach assumes that vulnerable groups do not interact with the rest of society. PEPFAR is perhaps the best example of ideological, non-scientific restrictions on the use of donor funding, although it also serves as an example of two of the other significant barriers to HIV prevention, due to its promotion of stigma and discrimination against vulnerable groups and the percentage of funding that it allocates to prevention.

However, Glaxo extended the life of these patents to 2016 by combining the two drugs into one pill (called Combivir). While the new combination reduces the number of pills that a patient needs to take, it did not involve the invention of any new chemical entities. The patent history of zidovudine has been cited as a classic case of \"evergreening\" -the use of the patent system to extend drug monopolies far beyond the term of the original patent (Hamied 2005). Box 9.3 discussed evergreening. Zidovudine was originally synthesized in 1964, as a potential cancer treatment. Research in 1984 showed that it was effective against HIV/AIDS, which formed the basis for Glaxo's 1984 patent application. Following clinical trials, the US FDA approved zidovudine in March 1987 for advanced HIV disease in adults and the patent for zidovudine as a treatment for HIV/AIDS was granted in February 1988 (Cochrane 2000) . While zidovudine alone only extended life by a matter of months, once it was combined with two other classes of HIV/AIDS drugs, it extended life for years. The FDA expanded zidovudine approval in 1990 to include",

This ruling will make many existing patents more vulnerable, make it harder to gain approval for new patents and make evergreening more difficult in the future. If the patent claim extends to what is obvious, it is invalid. For example, a patent's subject matter can be proved obvious if there existed at the time of invention a known problem for which there was an obvious solution encompassed by the patent's claims. The Supreme Court noted that, \"granting patent protection to advances that would occur in the ordinary course without real innovation retards progress and may, in the case of patents combining previously known elements, deprive prior inventions of their value or utility.\" It is worth quoting in full the Court's description of the reason that patents are only granted for non-obvious innovations:",

The most famous documented case of evergreening occurred in the WHO guidelines for ARV treatment regimens provide a basis for a range of treatment protocols in individual countries. In individual countries, factors such as prices, drug efficacy and side effects are also taken into account. Stavudine (d4T) recommended that d4T no longer be used, due to toxicity. Instead, countries should switch to tenofovir (TDF) or zidovudine (AZT). Of these two, TDF is preferable, because of its efficacy and safety and because it can be taken only once a day. emtricitabine (FTC), in one, triple-combination pill that can be taken once a day. Patients are more likely to adhere to this once-a-day regimen, thereby reducing AZT and TDF, compared to d4T, has delayed the shift to the new regimen in many below), the Clinton Foundation HIV/AIDS Initiative (CHAI) has negotiated price reductions for several HIV/AIDS drugs for use in 27 low-and middle-income countries (see Table 9 .6). The Clinton Foundation is discussed in Chap. 7. As of May 2007, 750,000 people were benefiting from medicines purchased under CHAI agreements in 50 countries (CHAI 2007). Table 9 .6. First, the prices are generally higher for middle-income countries than for low-income countries. Thus, the pharmaceutical companies are pursuing a price discrimination strategy across different markets, selling drugs at a price that the markets can bear. Therefore, there is clear room for generic products in these markets, especially for the low-income countries. Compulsory licensing is a distinct possibility (see, however, our discussion in Chap. 6 about the difficulties many developing countries faced importing drugs under compulsory license from Canada). Some companies have used the World Bank's country income index or the Human Development Index as their criteria for setting prices. In Chap. 6, we developed a much more comprehensive index that takes into account not just the level of development of the country but also level of prevalence of HIV/AIDS explicitly. Second, the price of HIV/AIDS drugs in many cases in many developing countries is not necessarily lower than in developed countries. For example, in Guatemala, between 2000 and 2003, prices of most HIV/AIDS drugs were consistently higher than in the United States (Hellerstein 2003).",

Medical care for people with HIV/AIDS in developing countries costs about USD 1,000 a year, in drugs and support facilities. The Economist estimated that it would cost USD 6-7 billion a year to provide treatment for the 6-7 million people with HIV/AIDS in low-income countries that were in need of treatment in 2006. However, expanding treatment means that fewer people will die. Moreover, millions more will become infected, and even more so if prevention efforts are not improved. Thus, universal treatment in lowincome countries could cost USD 40 billion by the end of the next decade. This highlights the need to ensure that external funding is both increased and sustained and the importance of prevention in making universal access to treatment affordable (Economist 2006).",

To date, antibody-based HIV-1 vaccines have only succeeded in neutralizing a minority of the copies of the virus that are found in a given patient. HIV-1 antibodies target the mechanism that HIV-1 uses to bind itself to the host immune cells in order to prevent HIV-1 from entering the cell. However, HIV-1 uses shielding mechanisms to prevent the antibodies from recognizing the virus, including a dense coating. Current HIV-1 vaccine research therefore seeks to find vulnerabilities in these shielding mechanisms, but this requires research for multiple genetic subtypes of HIV-1 (Montefiori et al., 2007) . For example, one recent study identified a place on the outside of the human immunodeficiency virus that could be vulnerable to antibodies that could block it from infecting human cells, which might be targeted with a vaccine aimed at preventing initial infection (Dunham 2007) .",

In that case, it will generate USD 10 100 = USD 1,000 profits by selling the vaccine to all 100 people. The other possibility is the following. The company sets a price of USD 100 for the vaccine. In that case, no person of type L will buy the vaccine ex-ante (as their expected benefit before HIV/AIDS strikes is USD 10 but the cost is USD 100). The only people who will buy the vaccine will be of type H. Since there are ten of type H, the profits will be USD 100 10 = USD 1,000. Thus, in either price strategy, the profits of the company will be USD 1,000. Therefore, the profits of the company are bigger in the case of the development of drug D instead of the vaccine V.

As we showed in Chap. 2, each of these issues must be considered in the context of specific countries or regions, in order to take into account variations in cultural values, affected groups, infection rates, legal systems, economic resources and human resources. In this chapter, we have analyzed prevention and treatment issues in greater detail. The preceding discussion shows that great progress has been made on these two fronts and that greater progress is possible. Our analysis of prevention issues in particular has shown the need to integrate prevention, treatment and human rights strategies. The primary reason that human rights need to be addressed is because discrimination keeps people away from both prevention and treatment programs (Gruskin et al., 2007) .",

Under inheritance laws, property remains in the man's family after he dies. Thus, if a woman wants to leave an abusive husband or her husband dies, she cannot take any property with her, leaving women economically dependant upon their husbands or, as widows, their families. New laws have created inheritance rights for dependants, but are ignored by the man's family and not enforced. As a result, women and children widowed and women must either rely on their in-laws for support or become commercial sex workers (Kelly 2004) .

The Guidance Note's strategy of reducing demand for sex work has been criticized as implicitly supporting the criminalization or repression of sex work, which can increase the risk of HIV infection by driving sex work underground, limit sex workers' choices regarding working conditions and clients and increase stigmatization. The Guidance Note was further criticized for not advocating enhanced human rights protection for those engaged in sex work -as women, men, transgender persons and workers. The process used for preparing the document was criticized for not meaningfully engaging sex workers. UNAIDS' response to criticism of this document -to withdraw it as a public document and restrict it to internal use -was also criticized (Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network 2007b) The United Nations International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights recommend that criminal law prohibiting sexual acts (including adultery, sodomy, fornication and commercial sexual encounters) between consenting adults in private should not be allowed to impede provision of HIV prevention and care services and should be repealed. With regard to adult sex work that involves no victimization, the International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights recommend de-criminalizing and legally regulating occupational health and safety conditions to protect sex workers and their clients, including support for safe sex during sex work. More generally, criminal law should not impede provision of HIV prevention and care services to sex workers and their clients and should ensure that children and adult sex workers who have been coerced into sex work are not prosecuted for such participation but rather are removed from sex work and provided with medical and psycho-social support services, including those related to HIV (United Nations 2007).",

In early 2004, there were four syringe exchange facilities in Saint Petersburg -one mobile service (a bus) and three fixed facilities. However, the most important source of sterile syringes for injection drug users was drug stores. Human Rights Watch found that state-supported impediments to access to both needle exchange points and drug stores were important barriers to HIV prevention, including: (1) police patrols of drug stores, which deterred injection drug users from purchasing syringes; (2) police patrols of needle exchange bus stops; and (3) arrests, fines or bribes for possession of syringes, even though carrying syringes is not illegal in the Russian Federation. However, while police interference with the syringe exchange bus was a problem in the late 1990s, it lessened in the early 2000s. Humanitarian Action, an NGO that delivers syringe exchange services in Saint Petersburg, visited with police chiefs to talk about the importance of syringe exchange for HIV prevention and organized a training session in 2003 for police officers that included the participation of former drug users and people living with HIV/AIDS. However, due to past incidents, the fear of apprehension by the police kept some drug users from using fixed as well as mobile syringe exchange facilities (Human Rights Watch 2004) . Table 9 .7 shows the dramatic increase in HIV prevalence among injection drug users in Saint Petersburg from 1998 to 2001. A 2005 survey of 500 injection drug users (IDUs) in New York City found that 65% had obtained a syringe from an exchange program in the previous year, 49% at a pharmacy, 10% from a medical provider, 53% from a friend or sexual partner and 25% from a drug dealer. The self-reported HIV prevalence rate in the group was 21%. IDUs who obtained syringes from sterile sources (exchange, pharmacy or provider) were less likely to share syringes than those who obtained them from non-sterile sources (friends, relatives or the street). Those who obtained syringes from exchange programs were significantly less likely to share syringes. Nevertheless, 19% of IDUs had shared a syringe at least once in the previous 12 months and 53% had engaged in unprotected sex. IDUs that had shared a syringe were 2.5 times more likely to engage in unprotected sex (NYC Health 2007).",

Thus, the criminalization of HIV transmission may have the effect of increasing, rather than reducing, HIV transmission. One possible response is mandatory HIV testing in health care settings (that is, testing without the informed consent of the patient).

In some cases, courts have applied existing criminal laws to cases involving HIV, where the laws themselves do not refer specifically to HIV. In this context, law reforms could come from the legislature, through amendments that clarify the application of relevant criminal laws to cases involving HIV, or through the evolution of precedents in the courts. The United Nations International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights recommend the reform of criminal laws and correctional systems to ensure that they are consistent with international human rights obligations and are not misused in tization of the judiciary, in ways consistent with judicial independence, on the legal, ethical and human rights issues relative to HIV, including through judicial education and the development of judicial materials (United Nations 2007). Criminal laws should not include specific offences against the intentional transmission of HIV but rather should apply general criminal offences to these exceptional cases. Such application should ensure that the elements of foreseeability, intent, causality and consent are clearly and legally established to support a guilty verdict and/or harsher penalties (United Nations 2007) .",

In R v. Cuerrier (1998) the Supreme Court of Canada established that there is a duty to disclose one's HIV status before engaging in any activity that poses a \"significant risk\" of HIV transmission. Failure to do so legally invalidates a sexual partner's consent to sexual intercourse. The lack of consent to have intercourse with a partner that is HIV-positive converts the sexual intercourse into a criminal assault. In that case, the complainants did not become infected with HIV as a result of the unprotected sex. However, if the complainants believe that their partner is HIV-free and the accused puts the complainants at significant risk to their health, failure to disclose HIV status vitiates consent to sexual intercourse. 9 The Way Forward Prevention, Treatment and Human Rights There have been numerous cases in which criminal laws have been applied to the context of HIV/AIDS (United Nations 2007).

The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the defendant was not guilty of the act itself, but rather the consequences of the act. Because it was likely that the defendant had infected the complainant before he learned of his HIV status, it could not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he had endangered the life of the complainant. However, the defendant was guilty of attempted aggravated assault for continuing to have unprotected sex with the complainant after having learned of his HIV status. The court ruled that there is sufficient criminal intent for a conviction on a sexual assault charge if a person acts \"recklessly\". In Canadian law, a person acts \"recklessly\" if they know that their conduct risks committing a crime but they commit the act nevertheless. In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that criminal recklessness is established once an individual becomes aware of a risk that he or she has contracted HIV, but continues to have unprotected sex without disclosure of HIV status, thereby creating a risk of further HIV transmission. In this case there was no evidence before the court regarding the defendant's awareness of the risk that he might be HIV-positive, prior to 15 November 1991, other than the fact that he had been asked to take an HIV test. This aspect of the ruling raised the issue of whether there is a duty to disclose the mere awareness of a risk that one might be HIV-positive before having unprotected sex. The court also suggested that an HIV-positive person might be held criminally liable for failure to disclose HIV status before having unprotected sex with another HIVpositive individual, where this results in the transmission of a different strain of HIV or a drug-resistant strain of HIV.",

More generally, the use of criminal law to prevent HIV transmission has been criticized for stigmatizing all HIV-positive people because of the conduct of a few individuals, for discouraging those most at risk from seeking testing and for being unlikely to stop people from having risky sex or sharing needles and syringes. Moreover, all of the HIV-related criminal prosecutions in Canada have occurred in the context of heterosexual intercourse, rather than homosexual intercourse or injection drug use, creating a perception of discriminatory application (or non-application) of the laws (Betteridge 2007).",

Unlike highly contagious diseases with short incubation periods, such as SARS, cholera and plague, HIV transmission can be prevented through safe sex and safe drug injection, which can be used by both the infected and the non-infected to prevent transmission. There is no evidence to support the assumption that both the infected and the non-infected will engage in unsafe practices. As a result, the presence of HIV-positive individuals, by itself, does not pose a risk to public health. In addition, travel restrictions are not effective in preventing the entry of HIV-positive individuals, since HIV tests do not detect the virus in newly infected people and nationals that are returning from travel abroad (who may have been infected while outside the country) are not subject to HIV/AIDS-related travel restrictions and are not prevented from entering their own country. Moreover, travel restrictions can undermine HIV/AIDS-related public health initiatives by increasing stigma and discrimination and mislead the public into thinking that HIV/AIDS can be or advice from the WHO.

In January 1991, the CDC again proposed that only active tuberculosis remain on the list of excludable conditions. Religious leaders campaigned to maintain the ban and the US House of Representatives opposed removing the HIV ban (AIDS Treatment News 1991) . In August 2007, Democratic Representatives Barbara Lee and Hilda Solis introduced the \"HIV Nondiscrimination in Travel and Immigration Act\". The proposed legislation would restore the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to determine whether HIV status is a communicable disease of public health significance. The decision to maintain or remove the ban would then be based on public health analysis instead of a formal ban made by Congress (Latino Commission on AIDS 2007). In November 2007, the US Department of Homeland Security proposed a new rule that would allow short-term visas to be granted to HIV-positive people by US consulates in their home countries. However, applicants would have to agree to conditions, including ceding the right to apply for longer stays or permanent residency in the United States. Democratic members of the US House of Representatives objected that the changes would only shift decision-making authority to local consular officers, who may lack the appropriate medical expertise.
