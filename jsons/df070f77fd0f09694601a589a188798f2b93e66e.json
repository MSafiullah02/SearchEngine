The consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic will affect vascular surgery worldwide for a long time period, and probably longer than expected now. Many of the postponed elective and semi-acute operations will have to be performed later on, in a secondary overwhelming wave of challenges. Paradoxically, a high death toll among the oldest in our populations may somewhat reduce the need of vascular surgery, and counteract this effect.",

While we did not ask for this turmoil, even the most devastating cyclone has a windless eye. One major drawback of the vascular registries in this particular situation is the fact that most of them only register patients who were operated on.",

The global scientific community has stood up to the highest standards. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the organisation of healthcare. Many hospitals and countries struggle with shortages of drugs, ventilators, and personal protective equipment, putting both patients and staff at risk.

Managing patients who are sick with Corona virus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is a significant challenge. The management of vascular patients with threats to both life and limb, when resources are limited, while protecting them from Sars-cov-2, has become a new clinical routine for many of our colleagues. Furthermore, personal protection, while working in the clinical environment, has become a high priority. Data suggest that healthcare professionals treating patients with Covid-19 are at a higher risk of developing a more severe infection, and high death tolls among doctors and nurses have been reported from China and Italy. Whereas the exact risks associated with operating on infected patients are still unknown, many surgical societies are issuing preliminary behavioural guidelines recommending full personal protective equipment for all operations (e.g., the UK Intercollegiate General Surgery Guidance on COVID-19).",

Most of the previous \"natural history\" studies stem from the early or middle 20th century, or are based on small cohorts of patients with severe comorbidities. For instance, we know the (low) risk of rupture among patients with small AAAs with a diameter of 40 -54 mm thanks only to the historical work of previous generations of vascular surgeons.5 But there are novel data from the UK AAA screening programme suggesting that contemporary risk of rupture may be even lower,6 and we know very little about the rupture risk above the diameter of 54 mm. Is this observed lower risk explained by changes in medication or smoking habits? The RESCAN study showed that the risk of rupture was twice as high among active smokers, 7 but can smoking cessation or medication decrease the risk of rupture while awaiting postponed surgery? The current pandemic offers unique scientific opportunities to address these questions. Similarly, what is the risk of deterioration and amputation in different subgroups of patients with chronic limb threatening ischaemia (CLTI)? We know that most patients benefit from an expedited management, but maybe there are subgroups of patients who can be managed less urgently, maybe even without invasive treatment? The global vascular guidelines on the management of CLTI have established the possibly underestimated importance of infection. 8Hopefully, the vascular registries have adapted their variables to the WIfI and GLASS classifications, as now may be the time to establish an up to date database to inform future treatment prioritisation.",
