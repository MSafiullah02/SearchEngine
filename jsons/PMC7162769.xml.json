In the last month, the Unit of Vascular Surgery of the teaching hospital S. Matteo, in Pavia, one of the hub centers for COVID-19 in Lombardy, the Italian region most affected by the pandemic, was requested to perform 30 compression ultrasound scans of the venous system, of both lower and upper limbs, of COVID-19 non-ICU patients with signs or symptoms suggestive of DVT, and 16 of them had positive results; 6 more had no DVT but superficial thrombophlebitis or upper limb lymphedema. The most frequent localization of the thrombus was the iliac-femoral-popliteal axis, followed by the brachial-axillary veins and the calf veins (Table\n). Four cases developed from a central vein catheter placed in the femoral vein. Although the numbers are too small to perform statistical analysis, the same period in 2019 could provide a term of comparison: in March 2019, the same unit performed 24 compression ultrasound scans on the whole hospital and found only 5 cases of DVT.",

A relationship was found between DVT and acute respiratory distress syndrome in influenza A H1N1, for which an enhanced leukocyte adhesion to the vein walls due to the production of inflammatory molecules was hypothesized, and empirical anticoagulation was proposed in all patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.3 Production of procoagulant factors, such as D-dimer and tissue factor, is another possible mechanism that has been well outlined in other community-acquired pneumonias, although no relationship with DVT has been established; a similar procoagulant stimulation can also occur in COVID-19 infection.4 A third possible favoring element that could also explain the upper limb involvement is the use of a continuous positive airway pressure ventilator, which is often tied in a way that can compress the superficial or deep vessels of the upper limbs; all patients with involvement of the upper limbs, in fact, were receiving continuous positive airway pressure therapy.",
