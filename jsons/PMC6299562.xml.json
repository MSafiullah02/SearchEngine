In a previous study, we estimated that the population-attributable fraction of ICU mortality due to CMV reactivation was 23% in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [7]. In a subsequent study among patients with septic shock, we found an effect of CMV reactivation on ICU mortality only in patients with concurrent Epstein\u2013Barr virus reactivation [8]. Although multiple studies point toward a causal relationship, definitive proof that CMV reactivation worsens clinical outcome is lacking, as most data are also compatible with a scenario in which CMV reactivation is merely a marker of immune suppression in this patient group.",

Markers reflecting impaired functioning of natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells were predictive of CMV reactivation [10, 11]. Furthermore, bacterial sepsis and corticosteroids have been identified as clinical risk factors for CMV reactivation [9, 12, 13]. However, less is known about the reverse association and thus the effects of CMV reactivation on the immune system. Direct cytotoxic effects of CMV on organs have been observed primarily in immunocompromised hosts [14] but also in previously immunocompetent patients in the ICU [15]. Moreover, indirect immune-modulating effects are assumed to play a role in the pathogenicity of CMV [13, 16\u201318].",

Observational clinical studies yielded conflicting results comparing levels of multiple inflammatory markers in patients with and without CMV reactivation [1, 11, 20]. However, these studies analyzed biomarker responses only immediately upon ICU admission and thus could not assess potential immunological effects due to the onset of CMV reactivation. Nevertheless, cytokine levels were used as a primary (surrogate) endpoint in a recent placebo-controlled randomized control trial in which prophylactic antiviral treatment with ganciclovir failed to reduce interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels [21]. Hence, definite proof of immune-modulating effects induced by CMV remains to be demonstrated. Naturally, such an effect can be demonstrated only after onset of CMV reactivation. Therefore, this longitudinal study aimed to investigate whether the temporal course of seven host response biomarkers, including both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, in previously immunocompetent ICU patients with sepsis differs between patients with and without CMV reactivation.",

Second, we matched patients with reactivation in a 1:1 ratio to CMV seronegative patients without CMV viremia (further referred to as \u201csecondary comparison\u201d). This secondary comparison was intended mainly to confirm results of the primary comparison; the rationale was that any finding suggestive for an effect of CMV reactivation should also become apparent when compared with seronegative patients who are not at risk for CMV reactivation. Matching criteria to reduce confounding were length of stay until reactivation (determines t = 0), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at t = 0 (\u00b1 2 points), age (\u00b1 10 years), sex, and high-dose corticosteroid use during 4 days prior to t = 0 (that is, more than 250 mg hydrocortisone or equivalent). Patients were also matched on hospital and calendar day of ICU admission (\u00b1 365 days) in order to reduce possible influences of variation in sample workup and biobank storage duration [22].

Subsequently, CMV load in blood was measured weekly, and for intermediary days, on which quantitative polymerase chain reaction was not performed, we estimated viral loads by log-linear imputation (see electronic supplementary materials of [7]). CMV viremia was defined as at least 100 international units (IU) per milliliter. This cutoff value was similar to the ones used in previous studies [7, 8]. Results of CMV viral load measurements in plasma performed for this study were not made available to the treating physicians, and none of the included patients received anti-CMV treatment. To map the immune response, we measured a panel of host response biomarkers in samples derived from five time points: day of viremia onset (t = 0), 2 days prior (t = \u22122), and after viremia onset at day 3, 7, and 10 (sample availability depended on length of stay in the ICU). A multiplex luminex immunoassay was performed by using EDTA plasma and included the following proteins: IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), IFN-\u03b3\u2013induced protein-10 (IP-10), neutrophilic elastase, granzyme-B, IL-1 receptor antagonist (RA), and IL-10.

Of note, in this pilot run, CMV reactivation was not associated with detectability of the four excluded biomarkers.",

A priori we chose to model the established immune markers IL-6 and IL-10. Based on the observed divergence in the symmetric percentage differences over time between groups, we conducted the multivariable analyses also for the pro-inflammatory chemokine IP-10 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1RA. Since not all CMV reactivation patients were included in both comparisons, we performed separate mixed model analyses for the primary and secondary comparisons. Thus, in total, eight models were built (for each of the four biomarkers in each of the two comparisons). For each model, SOFA score at t = 0 (that is, the day of reactivation) and age were included as confounders since we used a range (instead of an exact value) as matching criteria for these co-variables. For the fixed part of th emodels a polynomial term for time was evaluted (that is, quadratic time effect). Furthermore, a random intercept and a rondom slowe were evaluted for each model. Restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML) was used to generate unbiased variance estimates for the final models [25].

Proposed mechanisms of such indirect pathogenicity are autoantibody production, enhanced inflammation, vascular damage, and CMV-induced immunosuppression [17]. Based on this hypothesis and an observed association between plasma markers and mortality in patients with ARDS [26], IL-6 was used as a surrogate endpoint in a recent randomized controlled trial that evaluated the safety of preventive antiviral treatment in ICU patients [16]. Our finding that CMV reactivation is not associated with modified IL-6 dynamics questions the suitability of IL-6 as an endpoint in clinical trials evaluating preventive therapy for CMV reactivation in ICU patients.

First, to our knowledge, this is the first study with serial measurements of the immune response following (instead of prior to) CMV reactivation. Second, our study design included two matched control groups. Because of the used matched cohort design, we could include only 45 out of 63 patients with CMV reactivation but this loss was compensated by the ability to include controls that were more comparable to those patients. Sepsis patients in the ICU are known to be very heterogeneous [27, 28]; thus, the matching reduced in theory both confounding and unwanted variation by extraneous factors. Third, by using mixed model analyses, we accounted for correlation of measurements performed within one patient by the use of random effects, which increased the statistical power to identify differences between patient groups. Moreover, this type of analysis takes into account the considerable loss to follow-up of patients and allowed us to estimate an average trend over time based on available data.",

We chose a lower P value threshold of significance in order to decrease the risk of spurious findings due to multiple testing, but false-negative findings remain an accessory risk to keep in mind also when considering our study sample size. Unfortunately, a formal sample size calculation for this kind of statistical analysis was not possible. Nevertheless, we postulate that possible immunomodulating effects of CMV reactivation seem at most to be rather limited in these patients because no large differences in biomarker levels between matched groups were observed. Second, we analyzed host response biomarkers as standalone markers, which is probably a simplification of the complex immune response. However, large sample sizes are required to perform more advanced network analyses, and the integration of time series in such analyses, to our knowledge, has not been conducted before. We also measured only the plasma concentrations. Since CMV pneumonitis could be an important mediator of the pathological effect of CMV reactivation in critically ill patients, bronchoalveolar lavage samples may be additionally informative but were not available [16, 29]. Finally, we did not evaluate all potentially relevant biomarkers for CMV reactivation; thus, future studies are needed before an immunomodulating effect of CMV can be ruled out with certainty as an important pathological mechanism in previously immunocompetent ICU patients.",
