            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) belongs to the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, and genus Alphacoronavirus, and is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded positive RNA genome. It contains four structural proteins-spike (S), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), and envelop (E)-responsible for viral infectivity and the induction of immune response (Duarte and Laude, 1994, Duarte et al., 1994, Kocherhans et al., 2001). PEDV causes enteric disease, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality in neonatal pigs, and has been reported as a major source of substantial economic losses in most swine producer countries (Chen et al., 2010, Chen et al., 2013, Chen et al., 2012, Cima, 2014, Song and Park, 2012, Takahashi et al., 1983). In 2014, a less pathogenic PEDV strain was reported in the United States and several other swine producer countries (Chen et al., 2016, Vlasova et al., 2014, Yamamoto et al., 2015). This new strain presented insertions and deletions on the amino terminal region of the S protein. On the basis of differences in the S gene and virulence, emerging PEDV strains can be divided into non-S-INDEL (S gene insertions and deletions) and S-INDEL strains (Vlasova et al., 2014). PEDV pathogenesis is strain-specific, and pathogenesis studies in neonatal pigs have demonstrated that the PEDV non-S-INDEL strain is more pathogenic than the PEDV S-INDEL strain (Chen et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2016, Yamamoto et al., 2015). PEDV pathogenesis is also inversely correlated with the age of the animals. In adult pigs, PEDV infection is self-resolving regardless of previous PEDV immune status. Moreover, PEDV S-INDEL was shown to be clinically relevant in neonates, but clinical disease could not be reproduced in pigs older than three weeks (Annamalai et al., 2015, Chen et al., 2016).",

This interaction triggers the interferon regulatory transcription factor (IRF3/7) and activates NF-\u03baB, which modulates the expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Type 1 interferon alpha/beta (IFN\u03b1/IFN\u03b2) are the two essential cytokines that can control viral infections (Kawai et al., 2005, Seth, 2005, Xu et al., 2005). Within nidoviruses, acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) can evade the host immune system by interfering with the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (DeDiego et al., 2014, Matthews et al., 2014), and the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) inhibits the phosphorylation of kinases that are necessary to activate downstream signaling cascades (Chen et al., 2013, Devaraj et al., 2007, Kint et al., 2015a, Sun et al., 2012, Zhou, 2007).",

The canonical pathway includes the recruitment of the myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), containing the toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain for eventual activation of NF-\u03baB and induction of type I interferons (Kawai and Akira, 2007, Kawai and Akira, 2010, Thompson and Locarnini, 2007). In addition, endosomal receptor TLR3 contains exclusively TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-\u03b2 (TRIF) adapter proteins that interact with TRAF6, which induces IRF3/7 similar to the MyD88 pathway (Yamamoto et al., 2003, Zhengfan, 2004;). Finally, both the MyD88 and TRIF pathways activate NF-\u03baB and induce expression of the antiviral type I interferons (Thompson and Locarnini, 2007). The non-canonical pathway is TLR-independent, and NF-\u03baB can be modulated by RIG-I-TRAF3 mediated through IRF3 (Devaraj et al., 2007).",

It has been demonstrated that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of PEDV, during infection of HEK-293T cells, inhibited IFN-\u03b2 production by annexing the vital interaction between IRF3 and TBK1 (Ding et al., 2014b). Other in vitro studies in porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) determined that PEDV infection impeded the production of IFN-\u03b2 by inhibiting the RIG-I pathway and hampering the activation of IRF3 (Cao et al., 2015a). Studies in Vero cells showed that PEDV infection degraded STAT-1 and disrupted the IFN response (Li et al., 2016). Hence, it has been shown that PEDV can regulate different immunological pathways in vitro; the main regulatory effect of PEDV on mucosal innate immunity and its strain-dependence on viral pathogenicity is still unknown.",

The modulatory effect of pro-inflammatory interleukins and IFN genes is the result of a long-elaborated pathway that includes the activation of PRRs and downstream mediators, including MyD88 and TRIF, via NF-\u03baB activation. We evaluated whether the differential modulatory effect observed in PRRs and downstream mediators in response to infection with the PEDV S-INDEL versus the non-S-INDEL strain was also translated into a differential modulation in the expression of gene coding for pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons. Neither infection with PEDV S-INDEL nor non-S-INDEL was demonstrated to have a modulatory effect on local production of IL-6 (Fig. 6A). The local expression of IL-12 was not affected at 3 dpi regardless of the PEDV strain. However, a positive modulatory effect on IL-12 gene expression was exerted by PEDV S-INDEL at 7 dpi (Fig. 6B). The PEDV non S-INDEL strain showed a transient negative modulatory effect of the TNF-\u03b1 gene at 3 dpi, returning to basal control levels by 7 dpi. However, the PEDV S-INDEL strain consistently up-regulated the expression of the TNF-\u03b1 gene during the study (Fig. 6C).

Intestinal mucosa are composed of a variety of specialized cells that play specific functions during the disease process (Kawai and Akira, 2006, Kumar et al., 2009). Collectively, intestinal epithelium, dendritic cells, M cells, immune cells in the lamina propria, and peyer patches (e.g., lymphocytes and macrophages) play a role in the intestinal mucosa immune response against pathogens. PRRs are constitutively expressed in all cell populations referred to above and may have differential roles in each cell type and component of the intestinal mucosa. Initial PRR-induced responses are critical in controlling infectious agents, but are also tightly regulated through time-, location-, and cell type-dependent mechanisms. Positive and negative modulation interaction of signaling pathways is the main mechanism for maintaining inmate immune homeostasis. Interferon production, especially type 1 interferon and anti-viral cytokines, is important for host protection against viral invasion. Many viruses can evade the host immune system by regulating signaling pathways, resulting in the blockage of cytokine production (McCartney and Colonna, 2009).",

PEDV S-INDEL was shown to be clinically relevant in neonates, but clinical disease could not be reproduced in pigs older than three weeks (Annamalai et al., 2015, Chen et al., 2016). The molecular mechanism of innate immune modulation has only been evaluated in vitro, and thus available information is scarce (Cao et al., 2015a, Cao et al., 2015b, Ding et al., 2014a, Gao et al., 2015, Xu et al., 2013). However, it has been demonstrated that in vitro studies are highly dependent on virus strain and cell type, and are not valid for the evaluation of innate immune response against low-virulent strains (Kint et al., 2015b). Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the differential modulation of intestinal mucosa PRR signaling mounted against PEDV non-S-IDEL and S-INDEL in piglets from PEDV-na\u00efve sows. The use of an in vivo model further allowed the observation of the natural TLRs and signaling pathway homeostasis regulated by the intestinal microbiota.",

            "text": "There is limited information about the role of antiviral innate immunity in the pathogenesis of PEDV infection. However, it is well known that viral infections are usually detected by cell membranes and endosomal-associated TLRs (e.g., TLR4 and TLR3, TLR7/8) and cytosolic RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), such as RIG-I and MDA5. Activated TLR and RIG-I/MDA-5 signaling pathways initiate effective antiviral innate immune responses, in particular inducing type I INFs (Thompson and Locarnini, 2007). Previous in vitro studies demonstrated that PEDV strain CV777 infection of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) modulates the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway through up-regulation of TLR2, TLR3, and TLR9, but not RIG-I (Cao et al., 2015a). However, our results showed that in vivo, PEDV S-INDEL infection up-regulated the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway through TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, and RIG-I, resulting in increased expression levels of TNF-\u03b1. Although no statistical significance was found, increased levels of IFN-\u03b1 gene expression were also observed. Interestingly, both PEDV CV777 and PEDV S-INDEL strains belong to genogroup 1, and both are associated with mild clinical disease. Therefore, the differential modulation observed in the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway could be more associated with in vivo-related conditions than genotypic characteristics of the virus strain used in this study. Conversely, PEDV non-S-INDEL down-regulated the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway through a negative modulatory effect of TLR4, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9, resulting in final attenuation of pro-inflammatory TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b1 gene expression. Moreover, RIG-I gene modulation after PEDV non-S-INDEL remained unaffected. In a previous study, it was demonstrated that PEDV non-S-INDEL had a significantly higher replication rate compared to the less virulent PEDV S-INDEL strain (Chen et al., 2016). Our study demonstrated that the ability of PEDV to induce type I IFNs is strain-specific. Thus, type I IFNs may play an important role in PEDV replication and pathogenesis.",

            "text": "The signaling pathway during ligand binding of single-stranded and double-stranded viral RNA involves the cytoplasmic membrane TLR4 receptor and endosomal TLR7/8 and TLR-9, all of which are used as signaling pathway mediators, (MyD88 and TRIF) for eventual activation of NF-kB (Kawai and Akira, 2007, Kawai and Akira, 2010, Thompson and Locarnini, 2007). However, endosomal receptor TLR3 (Alexopoulou et al., 2001a) contains exclusively TRIF-adapter proteins that interact with TRAF6, which induces phosphorylation of IRF3/7 similar to the MyD88 pathway (Yamamoto et al., 2003, Zhengfan, 2004). Finally, both MyD88 and TRIF pathways activate NF-kB and induce expression of the antiviral type I interferons (Thompson and Locarnini, 2007). In this study, PEDV non-S-INDEL infection had a negative gene modulation on membranes and endosomal TLRs. This negative modulatory effect was translated into a down-regulation of cytoplasmic mediator MyD88 and TRIF genes. In vitro studies demonstrated that silencing TRIF and MyD88 but not RIG-I inhibited PEDV-induced NF-kB activation, suggesting that the TLR signaling pathway is involved in PEDV-induced NF-kB activation (Cao et al., 2015b). In addition, MyD88 is a required component of the innate immune response to mouse-adapted SARS-CoV infection in vivo (Totura et al., 2015). Although PEDV S-INDEL induces NF-kB activation, TLR pathway mediators TRIF and MyD88 were not significantly affected by the positive modulation of the cytoplasmic membrane and endosomal TLR genes in response to infection with PEDV S-INDEL. These contradictory results suggest that TRIF- and MyD88-independent pathways might be involved in NF-\u03baB activation after PEDV S-INDEL infection.",

The absence of TRAF6 resulted in enhanced viral replication and a significant reduction in the production of type I IFNs after infection with the RNA virus (Konno et al., 2009). Activation of NF-kB and IRF7, but not IRF3, is normally TRAF6-mediated. In this study, we observed that both PEDV S-INDEL and non-S-INDEL showed a negative modulatory effect on TRAF6, which was translated into a significant down-regulation of the IRF7 gene only in PEDV S-INDEL-infected animals. TRAF6 induced activation of IRF7, while TRAF3 is thought to activate both IRF3 and IRF7 (Konno et al., 2009). However, due to the differential modulation of IRF7 observed in this study, the role of the TRAF6-dependent pathway cannot be fully elucidated, and perhaps IRF3 plays a more important role in type I IFN production in PEDV infection. The role of TRAF3 was not explored in this study but may likely play a role in IRF7 and IFN-\u03b1 gene modulation. In addition, the down-regulatory effect observed in TRAF6 gene expression for both PEDV strains did not have the same modulatory effect on NF-kB gene expression. This study showed that NF-kB gene expression was PEDV strain-dependent. Although it may need further confirmation, the up-regulation of NF-kB gene expression observed in response to PEDV S-INDEL infection could be linked to the up-regulation of RIG-I gene expression induced after infection with the PEDV S-INDEL strain.",

Modulation of NF-kB family members (hetero-dimer p50-p65) is affected through th TLRs, which unbound the inhibitory IkB proteins and allowed activation of the NF-kB canonical pathway (Wietek and O\u2019Neill, 2007). We observed that PEDV non-S-INDEL exerted a down-regulatory effect on the p50-p65 hetero-dimer. The result observed during PEDV non-S-INDEL infection is in agreement with a previous in vitro study that demonstrated that PEDV-encoded nucleocapsid (N) protein can impede pro-inflammatory cytokine and type I interferon production by direct interaction with TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), resulting in inhibition of transcription factors, such as IRF3 and IRF7, causing final NF-\u03baB interference (Ding et al., 2014b). Moreover, it has been reported in vitro that PEDV non S-INDEL nsp1 protein induced NF-\u03baB suppression (Zhang et al., 2017). Inhibition of the p50-p65 hetero-dimer blocks activation of the NF-\u03baB canonical pathway and inhibits early TNF-\u03b1 response (Wietek and O\u2019Neill, 2007). Our results demonstrate that PEDV non-S-INDEL could use this strategy to evade the host immune system in addition to exhibiting an IFN-\u03b1 down regulatory effect. Although in this study we observed that PEDV S-INDEL down-regulated the p65 gene, the NF-\u03baB pathway was up-regulated. It has been demonstrated that inhibition of the p50-p65 hetero-dimer or the p50 homo-dimer can be compensated for by the p52-RelB hetero-dimer, resulting in the activation of the NF-\u03baB non-canonical pathway (Wietek and O\u2019Neill, 2007). In vitro studies demonstrated that PEDV protein E is capable of inducing p65 in intestinal epithelial cells and the activation of the NF-\u03baB non-canonical pathway (Xu et al., 2013). Moreover, further studies demonstrated that during PEDV CV777 infection, NF-kB p65 was found to be translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and PEDV-dependent NF-kB activity was associated with viral dose and active replication. In addition, the same study corroborated that upon PEDV N protein overexpression in transfected IECs, p65 was detected in the nucleus (Cao et al., 2015b).",

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is associated with improving humoral and mucosal immune response (Meng et al., 2013). In this study, IL-6 mucosal gene expression was not affected by PEDV infection. IL-6 expression levels are not necessarily correlated with the positive gene modulation of other pro-inflammatory cytokines. IL-12 is the major type I cytokine produced by macrophages and dendritic cells. IL-12 is believed to be responsible for enhancing Th1 and S-IgA response at the mucosal level (Boyaka et al., 1999). In this study, we observed that IL-12 was up-regulated at 7 dpi by PEDV S-INDEL. This modulatory effect is in agreement with a previous in vitro study, which also evaluated a low-virulent strain of CV777 (Gao et al., 2015). In this study, we observed a positive TNF-\u03b1 gene regulatory effect likely associated with the up-regulation of NF-KB in response to PEDV S-INDEL infection. We speculate that this might be the result of the RIG-I non-canonical pathway of NF-\u03baB, perhaps through the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and TRAF3 (not evaluated in this study) (Bowie and Unterholzner, 2008). Other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV, also showed a positive modulatory effect of TNF-\u03b1 through the activation of NF-KB. Conversely, PEDV infection with the high-virulent non-S-INDEL strain induced a down-regulation effect on TNF-\u03b1 gene expression. This negative modulatory effect on TNF-\u03b1 could be associated with the severe pathological response characteristic of PEDV non-S-INDEL strains.",

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both within the genus Betacoronavirus, do not induce significant IFN response in respiratory cells in vitro. However, transmissible gastroenteritis epidemic virus (TGEV) within the Alphacoronavirus genus induces a high level of IFN-\u03b1 in newborn pigs. PEDV also exists within the Alphacoronavirus genus; however, we found virus strain-related differences in IFN-\u03b1 gene modulation. Although no significant IFN-\u03b1 gene modulation was observed after PEDV S-INDEL infection, there was an increment consistent with previous reports on TGEV. The down-regulation observed in PEDV non-S-INDEL is more consistent with the effect observed with other members of the Betacoronavirus genus.

Our results suggest that PEDV S-INDEL infection induces pro-inflammatory cytokines through the non-canonical NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by activating the RIG-I receptor (Fig. 7). Meanwhile, PEDV non-S-INDEL infection suppresses the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type 1 interferon production by down-regulation of the cytoplasmic membrane and endosomal TLRs, as well as TLR downstream-signaling molecules (canonical NF-\u03baB pathway) (Fig. 7). These data present novel in vivo evidence supporting the notion that the evasion strategy of the PEDV non-S-INDEL strain might provide important insights into the pathogenesis of this strain. Based on our results, both low-virulent PEDV S-INDEL and high-virulent PEDV non-S-INDEL cause differential modulation on innate immune response pathways, which could be translated into differences in pathogenesis and clinical outcomes normally observed after PEDV infection.",

Significant difference between PEDV S-INDEL PEDV non S-INDEL and control group are expressed with their p values. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.",

            "text": "Fig. 7: Differential gene modulation of pattern-recognition receptor TLR and RIG-I-like, and downstream mediators on intestinal mucosa of pigs infected with PEDV non S-INDEL and PEDV S-INDEL strains. This figure present differential gene modulation at day post-infection (dpi) 3. PEDV non-S-INDEL infection suppressed the induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and type 1 interferon production (IFN- \u03b1) through the down regulation of the cytoplasmic membrane and endosomal TLRs (TLR4, TLR7/8, TLR9), and TLR-downstream signaling molecules (MyD88/TRIF and TRAF6). Although the expression levels of both p50 and p65 were down-regulated after infection with the PEDV non-S-INDEL strain, the down-regulatory effect on MyD88 and TRIF gene pathways did not negatively affect the expression of NF-\u03baB (Image 1). Contrary, PEDV S-INDEL infection induced a positive modulatory effect on TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7 gene expression. However, no significant modulatory effect was observed in the levels of TRIF, and MyD88, genes. PEDV S-INDEL infection induced the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, and interleukin (IL)\u221212 through the non-canonical NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by the activation of the intracytoplasmic RIG-I receptor (Image 2).",
