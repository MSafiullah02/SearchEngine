Over the course of the next ~20 years, an additional seven serotypes of human astroviruses were discovered.

            "text": "Based on the tenets of Koch's postulates [ 17 ] , the ability to grow a virus was long held as an essential step in its identi fi cation. However, enteric viruses have been notoriously dif fi cult to grow in culture and in fact this has been the biggest ongoing challenge for the last 40 years in the human norovirus fi eld [ 11 ] . The successful cultivation of some enteric viruses has depended on the inclusion of additives to the cultures (trypsin, pancreatin, bile, etc.) and/or serial blind passages in culture [ 3, 6, 49 ] . Even so, the ability to cultivate a virus does not inherently lead to its identi fi cation and characterization. In fact, visualization of viruses by electron microscopy (EM) was long used for the initial characterization of viruses that had been grown in culture or those present in stool samples from patients with diarrhea. In the 1970s, these methods were used to identify viral causes of diarrhea. The four families of viruses most commonly associated with diarrhea ( Rotaviridae, Caliciviridae, Astroviridae, and Adenovirus ) were all identi fi ed using EM [ 10, 18, 26, 34 ] . The identi fi cation of human astrovirus 1 was based on the observation of 28 nm virus particles present in stool from a child with gastroenteritis [ 34 ] . While these methods led to major advances in our understanding of the causes of diarrhea, they have limited our ability to detect a large number of viruses due to the fact that many viruses do not grow well, or at all, in cell culture and due to the relatively low sensitivity of EM studies. It is often dif fi cult to classify a virus based on EM observations because many viral families exhibit similar morphologies under the microscope and also only 10% of astrovirus particles exhibit the classical star-like morphology [ 37 ] . Furthermore, the use of serological assays to determine the identity of an unknown virus is limited by the need for the unknown virus to cross-react with speci fi c reagents for an already recognized virus. The use of serological assays is also hampered by the requirement for a priori knowledge of the possible identity of the unknown virus since there are currently no pan-viral serological assays available.",

            "text": "The age of molecular biology has had an impact on virology just as it has on many other fi elds. In particular, the invention of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the 1980s made it easy to detect viral genomes. If the appropriate sequences are available, it is quite easy to design primers to detect a given virus of interest. Analogous to the use of primers that target 16S ribosomal genes of bacteria for identi fi cation and classi fi cation of bacterial species, primers can often be designed to highly conserved regions of the genomes of viruses from a particular family or lower taxa. Such PCR assays can be used to identify novel viruses which happen to be closely related to existing viruses. Various computational strategies have been described for the speci fi c design of consensus PCR primers to use for novel virus identi fi cation [ 24, 45 ] . The breadth of PCR assays is limited to interrogating a single taxon, which can be a limitation when there is no information to focus the efforts towards a particular group of viruses. However, there are numerous examples of viruses discovered in this fashion, with two notable instances being the identi fi cation of sin nombre virus [ 40 ] and human coronavirus HKU1 [ 53 ] . As will be discussed later in this chapter, PCR assays that were designed after the discovery of novel astrovirus MLB1 were used to identify additional novel astroviruses.",

            "text": "Dideoxy sequencing or Sanger sequencing, fi rst described in 1977 [ 46 ] , was the dominant DNA sequencing technology used for nearly 30 years. The typical sequence read length for Sanger sequencing can reach ~750-800 bp. Sanger sequencing is carried out individually for each sequence, so the number of sequences that can be generated for a single sample is simply a function of cost and time. This technology was the cornerstone of all signi fi cant sequencing projects up until ~2005, including the sequencing of the human genome. Starting in 2005, multiple new sequencing technology platforms (\"NextGen\") emerged that have now far surpassed conventional Sanger sequencing in terms of increased total sequence production capacity and decreased cost. With NextGen platforms, sequences can be modi fi ed to encode speci fi c strings of bases that serve as barcodes for individual samples, such that many samples can be combined into a single run on the NextGen machines. The NextGen platform that has been most widely used for virus detection and sequencing is 454 pyrosequencing [ 44 ] . At the time of the studies described in this chapter, one 454 sequencing run produced ~400,000 sequence reads of an average read length of ~250-400 bp [ 35 ] . Both Sanger sequencing and 454 pyrosequencing have been used in the discovery and sequencing of novel astroviruses.",

            "text": "Human rotaviruses and noroviruses are the leading causes of viral diarrhea [ 9, 42, 52 ] while human astroviruses have been associated with up to ~10% of sporadic cases of viral diarrhea in children [ 19, 51 ] and with 0.5-15% of outbreaks [ 2, 33, 48 ] . However, the cause of approximately 12-41% of the cases of sporadic diarrhea and gastroenteritis outbreaks remains undetermined despite extensive testing [ 25, 33, 48 ] . One hypothesis for the cause of such a diagnostic gap is that there are unidenti fi ed pathogens contributing to the burden of disease. This was the guiding principle of the initial study that led to the identi fi cation of Astrovirus MLB1 (AstV-MLB1) [ 12 ] . Stool samples from children with cases of acute, sporadic diarrhea were subjected to \"micro-mass sequencing\" meaning that only limited sequencing was done (384 sequences) per sample in contrast to the typically tens of thousands of sequences generated per sample using NextGen sequencing platforms that were used in studies described later in this chapter. One of the most interesting fi ndings of the study was the detection of sequences, within one sample collected in 1999 from a 35-month-old child, that were most closely related to human astroviruses. These sequences were highly divergent from canonical human astroviruses 1-8, suggesting that a novel virus might be present. There were seven unique sequence reads derived from two loci that displayed 42-61% amino acid identity to human astroviruses. The sequence reads overlapped such that they could be assembled into two contiguous stretches of sequence referred to as contigs. RT-PCR was used to con fi rm the accuracy of the assembled contigs and subsequent sequencing of the amplicons con fi rmed the presence of the contigs in the original RNA extract. One contig was ~800 bp long and mapped to ORF1a, the serine protease, of the astrovirus genome and the other one was ~500 bp long and mapped to ORF1b, the RNA polymerase. Phylogenetic analysis of the two contigs yielded trees that demonstrated that these sequences in fact represented a novel astrovirus ( Fig. 7.1 ).",

            "text": "This novel astrovirus was named Astrovirus MLB1 (AstV-MLB1) because it was identi fi ed in a stool sample from a child in Melbourne, Australia. In the follow-up study, the complete genome of AstV-MLB1 was sequenced to an average of >3X coverage [GenBank: FJ222451] and the virus was further characterized [ 14 ] . The AstV-MLB1 genome is organized like that of other astroviruses in that it is predicted to encode three open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2) and contain both 5 \u00a2 and 3 \u00a2 nontranslated regions (NTR), as well as a poly-A tail. AstV-MLB1 has a shorter genome than other astroviruses with only 6,171 bp (excluding the poly-A tail) compared to the range for the other astroviruses of ~6,400-7,300 bp [ 37 ] (Table 7 .1 ). This is in large due to two deletions, totaling 57 amino acids, located within a highly conserved 144 amino acid motif near the carboxyl terminus of human astroviruses 1-8. The motif has been mapped as an immunoreactive epitope in human astroviruses [ 36 ] and is located in the nonstructural protein p38 [ 28 ] , a protein reported to be involved in replication [ 20 ] and particle release [ 38 ] . The effect this deletion has on the replication of AstV-MLB1 has yet to be determined. Another difference between AstV-MLB1 and the canonical human astroviruses arises in the 3 C-like protease motif in the putative substrate binding residues. The canonical human astroviruses share the conserved residues RTQ whereas AstV-MLB1 is identical to ovine astrovirus with the residues ATR. Again, the meaning of this difference is yet to be explored.",

The 5 \u00a2 nontranslated region (NTR) is only 14 nucleotides long which is more comparable to the 5 \u00a2 NTRs of avian astroviruses (~10-20 nt) than to the 5 \u00a2 NTRs of human astroviruses 1-8 (80-85 nt long, 37 ) (Table 7 .1 ). Furthermore, human astroviruses 1-8 contain a 120 nt region at the junction between ORF1b and ORF2 that is highly conserved with a 52 nt core region that is 99-100% identical among the human astrovirus serotypes [ 50 ] . It is hypothesized that this sequence serves as a regulatory element of the sub-genomic RNA that encodes the capsid. AstV-MLB1 is only 61.5% identical to other human astroviruses in the 52 nt core region. This is similar to the level of identity (44-59.6%) shared between the known animal astroviruses and the human astroviruses.

It is thought to interact with viral and cellular proteins needed for RNA replication and to be quite important because (1) it is also found in some other RNA viruses and (2) compensatory mutations that restore base pairing are often seen when there are mutations in the conserved motif [ 39 ] . AstV-MLB1 not only lacks this conserved nucleotide motif but it also has the shortest 3 \u00a2 NTR reported to date for an astrovirus. It is not clear the importance of any of these differences in the coding or noncoding regions of the AstV-MLB1 genome compared to other astroviruses, but these may be interesting avenues of research in the future.",

The samples tested negative for enteric parasites, bacteria, and viruses so they were subjected to high-throughput pyrosequencing and Sanger sequencing by two different groups that reported their fi ndings together [ 16 ] . Unique sequences were detected in two of the samples by pryosequencing: 313 sequences in one sample and 1,017 sequences in the other. Astrovirus-like sequences were assembled together into contigs of 6,376 nucleotides (nt) and 6,026 nt from the two samples.

When the two contigs were assembled together they generated a contig of 6,581 nt in length. The Sanger sequencing that was done simultaneously also resulted in the detection of unique astrovirus-like sequences in the same two samples: 3 in one sample and 69 in the other. Further RT-PCR ampli fi cations and 5 \u00a2 RACE (rapid ampli fi cation of cDNA ends) reactions were used to determine that the full length of the virus is 6,586 nt, excluding the poly-A tail (Table 7 .1 ).

            "text": "With these exciting discoveries of new astroviruses come many challenges. One of these challenges is what to name these new viruses and how to decide if they represent new species. Previously, astroviruses were named for the species they infect (human, turkey, etc.). The classic human species consists of eight closely related serotypes which are named 1-8. In a similar fashion, the HMO astrovirus names are derived from their relationship to human, mink and ovine astroviruses. On the other hand, AstV-MLB1, AstV-VA1, and AstV-PS are named for the site that the sample originated from. A more uniform and instructive naming system needs to be put in place. Kapoor et al. have suggested a naming scheme in which human astroviruses 1-8 are renamed HAstV-1 with a letter (a-h) following the name to denote each serotype and then naming the novel astroviruses described in this chapter HAstV-2-HAstV [ 27 ] . This issue of nomenclature is currently being addressed by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) study group for Astroviruses. Additionally, how to de fi ne a new species needs to be addressed. There are currently no speci fi c rules in place.",

There is a major gap in our understanding of the causes of diarrhea, given that ~40% of all cases are of unknown etiology [ 25, 33, 48 ] . While astroviruses are known to cause diarrhea, they have generally been associated with at most 10% of both sporadic and outbreak cases of acute diarrhea. The initial identi fi cation of fi ve novel astroviruses in human stool samples over the course of a 2-year period hints that astroviruses may have a larger role in causing human diarrhea than previously believed. Prior to 2008, there were eight known human astroviruses that are all genetically very closely related. It is possible that this paradigm will be upheld for each of the newly described astroviruses in that each one could represent a whole new cluster of astroviruses. As technologies advance and more samples are screened from all over the world, it is likely that other novel astroviruses will be discovered.",

However, the identi fi cation of these novel viruses is surely only the beginning of the story for these viruses. There are many questions that have been raised regarding each virus' tropism, epidemiology, and potential link to disease. Answering these questions will require many years of further investigation, using the available tools of biology and medicine. While all of the recently discovered astroviruses described in this chapter were fi rst identi fi ed in stool samples, some have now been detected in other biological specimens or in stools from people without diarrhea. These fi ndings are in no way conclusive, but they do reveal the possibility that astroviruses may be associated with other diseases in humans. The major questions for all of these viruses are (1) Are they truly human pathogens? and (2) If so, what diseases do they cause? These questions are dif fi cult to answer short of doing human infection trials. However, the studies described in this chapter have begun to address these questions.",
