The system covers national notifiable infectious diseases for all 31 provinces in mainland China. We analysed data for the decade from 2008 to 2017. All types of health facilities in China are covered in the CISDCP, including hospitals, Centers for Disease Control (CDCs) at each level, community health centres, township health centres, and village clinics. Supplementary figures S1 and S2 present the national coverage rates of CISDCP network reporting and its geographical variations by year from 2008 to 2017 for township level and for county level and above. The national average coverage rates of CISDCP remained stable during this decade, ranging from 85.1% to 95.4%. In 2017, web based reporting covered 87.2% national health facilities. The national coverage rates for health facilities at county level and above were higher than that at the township level (ie, in 2017, county level and above was 95.8% and township level was 85.5%). Coverage was also higher in the eastern regions than in the western regions in each year (ie, in 2017, coverage in the eastern region was 95.1%, central region was 94.5%, and western region was 81.6%).",

Hepatitis C was classified within an extended category of sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne infections and hepatitis E similarly for zoonotic infections. The revised categories were quarantinable; vaccine preventable; gastrointestinal and enteroviral; vectorborne; zoonotic; bacterial; and sexually transmitted and bloodborne (see table 1). Medical staff confirmed all patients with a clinical diagnosis by clinical standards and laboratory tests based on national uniform standards (see supplementary appendix).

The same models were used to test the differences across regions and sex-age subgroups. Joinpoint regression analysis identifies time points in which trends significantly change (ie, joinpoints), using calendar year as the timescale.23\n24 To determine the location of the joinpoints, we used the grid search method. This creates a grid of all possible locations for joinpoints at each survey year and tests the sum of squared errors for each point to find the best fit.22\n25 Joinpoint regression assumes normal distribution of disease incidence. If this assumption does not hold, data transformation is recommended. In our data, some infectious diseases had Poisson distributions and required a logarithmic transformation to approximate a normal distribution. The resulting log-linear models were easier to interpret in the joinpoint regression analysis. Under a log-linear model, rates change at a constant percentage each year, calculated in our study as a fixed APC, whereas in a linear model, the rates change at a constant amount each year. When comparing trends in different categories or for specific infectious diseases or across provinces, the rates are different. The advantage of a log-linear model is that the APC can be compared across widely different scales. For example, rare and common infectious diseases might change at the same annual percentage each year, but it is unlikely that they would change at the same fixed amount each year. With this approach, infectious diseases were assumed to change at a constant percentage of the rate of the previous year. For example, if the APC was 1% and the rate was 50 per 100 000 in 2007, then in 2008 the rate was 50\u00d71.01=50.5, and in 2009 the rate was 50.5\u00d71.01=51.005. Rates that change at a constant percentage every year change linearly on a log scale. The P value for a two sided test that the true APC is zero was calculated based on a t distribution. If the APC was non-significant (P\u22650.05), we regarded trends as stable, otherwise, it increased or decreased for each infectious disease from 2008 to 2017.",

            "text": "China still, however, faces challenges in responding to infectious diseases in children and adolescents. Firstly, rapid urbanisation and industrialisation and changing patterns of interactions between people and pathogens have altered the pattern of infectious diseases,15 a feature of the covid-2019 outbreak. Geographical disparities raise questions around access to healthcare, other medical and educational resources, public health programmes, and infrastructure in rural and remote areas. Not surprisingly, the western regions of China with poor resources and a special geographical environment and culture face a burden from multiple infectious diseases, with Qinghai, Tibet, and Xinjiang having higher incidence of vaccine preventable diseases, bacterial infections, and sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne infections. However, the epidemiological characteristics of infectious diseases are also affected by densely populated urban regions,55 which might contribute to higher rates of sexually transmitted diseases and viral gastrointestinal infections, at least in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. Different factors apply in rural and remote areas, where livestock based lifestyles increase the risk of zoonotic infections and where climate might be an additional factor, particularly for vectorborne diseases. Seasonal variation in infectious diseases, with the example of peaks of influenza and rubella, measles, and scarlet fever in winter and spring suggests the high vulnerability of Chinese children to infections transmitted by aerosol droplets. Furthermore, the rapid increase in HIV/AIDS, especially in adolescent males, requires a much wider set of social and educational responses than for less sensitive behaviours and stigmatised diseases. The resurgence of some diseases that were previously under control (eg, scarlet fever, mumps, syphilis, and brucellosis) and imported cases (eg, Zika virus infection, Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, and Ebola) have put greater pressure on the public health system, as has been seen with the current covid-2019 outbreak that began in Hubei province, China. Although in most cases of covid-19, mortality appears to be higher in older people,10 although the immediate impact of this on children and adolescents is nonetheless immense. A global pandemic of covid-19 could bring about multiple impacts, such as economic recession, food crisis, price fluctuations, constraints on resources, which will have immediate or indirect negative effects on children in the near or long term. In addition, the exact impact has not yet been determined in further studies, but there could be physical and psychological effects on children who have been deprived of concentrated effort of care as a result of the guardian\u2019s illness, which need further studies post-covid-19.",

Under regulations from the China Centers for Disease Control\u2019s (CDC) China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP), health facilities are required to report all cases of notifiable infectious diseases through the web based system, with the validity of the surveillance system being continuously monitored. In terms of system coverage, although CISDCP has not yet reached all health facilities in China, all types of health facilities are covered, including hospitals, CDCs, community health centres, township health centres, and village clinics. Total coverage is at least 85% throughout the country with more than 95% coverage of county level and above facilities each year (see supplementary fig S1). Among 69 881 facilities with reported case information in 2014, the participation levels were 3597 CDCs (100%), 13 764 hospitals (97%), and 37 494 township level clinics (89%).56 Despite this, the national coverage of CISDCP remains biased to some extent. The coverage within some provinces, particularly in the less developed provinces in western China, such as Tibet (18.6%), Qinghai (66.8%), and inner Mongolia (58.5%), was lower than in eastern more developed regions (95.1%). Furthermore, coverage of township level health facilities in rural areas remained less than that in urban cities with facilities above county level. It is therefore likely that we have underestimated infectious diseases in western less developed regions, and in remote towns and rural areas of China (see supplementary fig S2).",

            "text": "A second consideration is the validity of the surveillance system and accuracy of diagnosis. Generally, although suspected cases, pathogen carriers, and confirmed cases are all entered into CISDCP, in the present study we only analysed patients with a diagnosis confirmed by both uniform clinical standards and laboratory tests (ie, examination of, for example, pathogen, serology, imaging; see supplementary table S5 and the appendix). Decisions about diagnosis are overseen by professional trained specialists from the CISDCP, which ensures a high level of accuracy within this sample. For example, the diagnosis of HIV/AIDS is based on laboratory serum testing for HIV antibody and the detection of pathogens, combined with clinical symptoms and epidemiological data. However, under-reporting will be variable, most likely for people with subclinical and asymptomatic infections being managed at home, especially for seasonal influenza; hand, foot, and mouth disease; and infectious diarrhoea, particularly in remote areas. In contrast, serious infections that are highly contagious and might result in outbreaks or epidemics (categories A and B in China\u2019s domestic notifiable infectious diseases classification; see supplementary table S4) will have high sensitivity and specificity. This includes the plague, cholera, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis A, tuberculosis, dysentery, and measles. It is possible that variable clinical expertise and technical expertise influences the number of confirmed cases in any setting. However, all 44 notifiable diseases in CISDCP have well established case definitions and diagnostic pathways, incorporating clinical features identification, laboratory confirmation, reporting procedures, and determination of specific pathogens. Nearly all of the 44 notifiable diseases had consistent case definitions and diagnostic criteria across the decade. Considering the consistent geographical variations in CISDCP coverage and the definitions and diagnostic criteria, and the stability of pathogenicity of most pathogenic agents, the likelihood of variation over time for subclinical and asymptomatic cases in the 44 notifiable diseases over the past decade is unlikely to have affected the trend analyses reported here. We note that estimates of the burden of death might vary between countries for mortality from seasonal influenza. For example, in China the use of estimates from death certificates that specifically list influenza will underestimate the burden of influenza, whereas the mathematical model to estimate the number of influenza deaths such as used in the United States could result in overestimation.57 Clearly, new challenges for the surveillance system are posed by emerging infectious diseases with an unclear disease course, such as covid-2019.",

As we excluded children and adolescents who were not studying, we are unable to comment on the epidemiology of infectious diseases in preschool children.58 Given the free nine year compulsory education system in China, it is likely that the data for the younger student population will be broadly representative of this age group. The estimate bias in our study is likely to be higher with age (see supplementary fig S11), which might lead to underestimation of the actual burden of infectious diseases in adolescents, particularly for HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne infections. Because of the social stigma around some sexually transmitted diseases, and lack of health service use for milder gastrointestinal infections, we could have underestimated the burden from these diseases.59 Although more males than females in each age group were not included in the analysis, the percentage of girls not included was larger (17.0% v 19.8%). As a result, although we underestimated the number of boys with notifiable infectious diseases nationally, the rates of underestimation were probably higher among girls who completed school early after nine year compulsory education (see supplementary fig S12). Both the number and the rates of underestimation of infectious disease burdens among children and adolescents of all occupations in this age group could be high in several provinces with large populations and high floating or mobile populations and low educational participation, such as Guangdong (non-students rates of 22.6%), Henan (24.9%), and Sichuan (20.0%; see supplementary fig S13).",

Beyond maintaining the gains, the priorities for the coming decade include reducing regional inequalities; scaling-up vaccination for mumps, seasonal influenza, and hepatitis B; preventing further escalation of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases; and redoubling efforts around persisting diseases, including tuberculosis, rabies, and scarlet fever. Different responses will be needed by region and by age across childhood and adolescence, while the newer emerging disease epidemics will require rapid and targeted responses. Seasonal variation in respiratory infections and in gastrointestinal and enterovirus diseases reflect the high vulnerability of children and adolescents.
