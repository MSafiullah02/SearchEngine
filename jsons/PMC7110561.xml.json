In healthy individuals influenza is generally self-limiting, but can often cause complications.1, 2 There are 3 types of seasonal influenza viruses \u2013 A, B, and C. Influenza A causes moderate to severe illness and affects individuals of all age groups. Influenza B can cause disease of similar severity as influenza A, and even though the morbidity is higher in children, all age groups can be affected.3, 4 The influenza B virus is more stable than influenza A, with less antigenic drift and consequent immunologic stability, and does not undergo the process of antigenic shift. Influenza C is rarely reported as a cause of human illness, probably because most cases are subclinical.5 Both influenza A and B cause annual epidemics worldwide and are estimated to result in 3\u20135 million cases of severe illness, and 250,000\u2013500,000 deaths.6\n",

Until the 2012\u20132013 influenza season, use of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines, containing two influenza A strains (A[H1N1] and A[H3N2]) and one influenza B lineage (B/Yamagata or B/Victoria) was recommended for use in immunization programs by the World Health Organization (WHO).6 As influenza viruses undergo frequent changes in their surface antigens, new influenza vaccines are designed annually to match the circulating virus subtype expected for the next influenza season.7 The selection of the influenza B lineage is considered critical in determining the effectiveness of vaccination programs.7 Unfortunately, the correct prediction of the predominating circulating B lineage is quite difficult, often leading to inaccuracies in prediction, causing a mismatch between the recommended vaccine lineage and the circulating influenza B lineage. Prior studies have raised concerns that mismatches can result in lower vaccine effectiveness, due to the absence of cross-protection between antigenically distinct influenza B lineages, leading to more influenza cases,8, 9 and an increase in influenza-related medical resource utilization and costs.2, 10 In addition to this, Matias et al.11 have found that influenza B-associated mortality could serve as a surrogate marker of disease severity.",

Importantly, the extent to which the vaccine recommended influenza B virus lineage matches the influenza virus lineage circulating in the population during an influenza season is known to impact the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination programs.14 Data on laboratory surveillance of the influenza B virus in Brazil are limited, specifically data on the burden of disease and circulation patterns of influenza B lineages.

We referred to international data sources to check WHO recommendations on the vaccine composition in the Southern hemisphere,18 and information on circulating influenza lineages for Brazil, the South America region and globally from the WHO/FluNet database which provides data through its network \u2013 Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) laboratories.19 Consolidation of available national epidemiological information on Influenza in the Epidemiological Bulletins of the Brazilian MoH was also performed. Bulletins available from 2009 to Epidemiological Week 35 of 2014 were considered.15 In Brazil, two types of surveillance exist: Sentinel surveillance of ILI and Universal Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) surveillance. ILI is defined as fever followed by cough or sore throat and symptoms onset within the last seven days. SARS is defined as fever followed by cough or sore throat and experiencing dyspnea, requiring hospitalization. Oxygen saturation levels lower than 95%, respiratory distress, or respiratory rate increase, are also considered in SARS. The sentinel ILI surveillance, which has a network of units distributed throughout the country's geographic regions, is used in the identification and characterization of circulating respiratory viruses in viral isolations. The universal SARS surveillance, which was implemented post-identification of the influenza A(H1N1) 2009 pandemic strain (pdm09), monitors hospitalized cases and deaths. In both systems, data are collected by means of standardized forms and entered into the online information systems: Influenza epidemiological surveillance system called SIVEP-Gripe for ILI cases, and the National Information System for Notifiable Diseases known as SINAN Influenza Web for SARS cases. Results from tests performed at the 27 Public Health Central Laboratories (\u201cLaborat\u00f3rios Centrais de Sa\u00fade P\u00fablica, Lacen\u201d) are routinely included in these systems. The diagnostic kits currently available identify the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viral strain (determined by WHO), influenza A(H3N2), influenza A not subtyped, and influenza B virus. The antigenic characterization of the circulating influenza virus lineage is performed by three laboratories in Brazil (\u201cInstituto Evandro Chagas\u201d \u2013 Par\u00e1, \u201cInstituto Adolfo Lutz\u201d, S\u00e3o Paulo and \u201cInstituto Oswaldo Cruz\u201d, Rio de Janeiro).

Influenza virus circulation demonstrates a seasonal pattern with highest occurrence from April to June, while RSV circulation showed more intense activity in the first months of the years. Influenza B follows similar seasonal trends; however it seems to occur slightly later than influenza A. During the seasons of 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, influenza A and RSV predominated followed by influenza B. In the year 2013, the absolute numbers of influenza B typed samples in ILI cases was higher (n\n = 727; 36.2% [2013]) compared to the previous years (n\n = 128; 21.0% [2009], n\n = 213; 46.3% [2010], n\n = 191; 34.5% [2011], n\n = not available [2012]) and 2014 (n\n = 150; 12.7% [2014, up to epidemiological week 35]).

Even though this observation was restricted to only one year with 90% mismatch it is in line with previous reports wherein influenza B has been reported to affect more schoolchildren and the appearance of the new B lineage reinforced this pattern.4 An implication of this finding is that children and adolescents might benefit the most from the addition of a second influenza B lineage to the seasonal influenza vaccine. Moreover, it could be useful for the entire population as it is widely considered that vaccinating children can reduce influenza illness in family members and other susceptible populations in the community by reducing the risk of exposure and subsequent influenza infection and related complications.47 A similar finding by Heikkinen et al.10 reports a substantial population-level impact of outbreaks resulting from mismatched seasons in Finland with this impact predominating in children and adolescents.",

In the same year, 85 deaths due to influenza B were registered. This occurrence could have been due to an outbreak of SARS caused by influenza B. It was demonstrated by Matias et al.11 that influenza B-associated mortality could potentially be a valid indication of disease severity.

Other studies confirm that the B/Yamagata was the major circulating lineage until the 1980s, when B/Victoria lineage viruses appeared; since then, drift variants of both influenza B lineages have been co-circulating worldwide.49, 50 As influenza B viruses can co-circulate during an epidemic allowing the re-emergence of old lineages due to re-assortment between the different strains,4, 48 there is a need to improve influenza laboratory-based surveillance in Brazil. Importantly these data also highlight the unpredictability of influenza B circulation, making it difficult to consistently predict which B lineage will predominate during a given influenza season.",

This burden could, in particular, be substantial during an outbreak. To avoid this additional burden, a plausible option would be to switch from the use of trivalent influenza vaccines to quadrivalent vaccines in national campaigns.51 Quadrivalent influenza vaccines are expected to offer broader protection against influenza B disease. The WHO recently updated recommendations beginning with the 2013\u20132014 influenza, now recommending the use of a quadrivalent vaccine composition with the addition of a second influenza B lineage as well as the two influenza A strains and one influenza B lineage contained in the trivalent vaccines.6, 52\n",

Besides the inherent limitations of each of the studies included in the literature search and abstracts, there are other important limitations. Statistical and quality analysis of the articles was not performed. Also, the interpretation of data is constrained by the gaps in laboratory surveillance in which there were no influenza B data available for many years with respect to age, severity, and seasonality. As we present data over many years through which the surveillance system has gradually improved, the number of positive samples is still small, and the more recent years are likely to be over-represented. Additionally, sentinel surveillance data cannot be truly representative for the whole population as the system of sentinel units involves different levels of care. Moreover, there is no standard protocol for patient selection for sample collection which may have led to a selection bias of certain age groups. Despite these limitations, the surveillance system for influenza and other respiratory viruses which has improved over the years has proven useful to describe influenza B circulation patterns for Brazil and demonstrate that influenza B epidemiology is changing in line with observations reported from other countries.4\n",

The findings from this integrative data review provide evidence of the unpredictable nature of influenza B circulation in Brazil, the increasing frequency of co-circulation of both influenza B lineages, and mismatch between the circulating influenza B lineage and the composition of the seasonal influenza vaccine for the region. This data is suggestive of the additional benefit that quadrivalent influenza vaccines, containing both influenza B lineages (B/Yamagata and B/Victoria), could offer over the use of the currently available trivalent vaccines for the prevention of seasonal influenza in Brazil.",
