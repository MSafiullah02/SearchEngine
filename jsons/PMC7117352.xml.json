They are enveloped viruses possessing a single-stranded positive-sense approximately 30 kb RNA genome with a 5\u2032 cap and a 3\u2032 polyadenylated tail (Lai et al., 2007). The virions are composed of a nucleocapsid (N) protein and three or four membrane-associated proteins, the peplomer or spike (S), membrane (M), hemagglutinin-esterase (HE), and a minor small envelop (E) proteins, present in a lipid-containing envelope (Lai et al., 2007). On the basis of serological and genotypic criteria, coronaviruses are divided into three distinct groups 1\u20133, which are members of the new order of Nidovirales together with the Arteriviridae family (Cavanagh, 1997, Spaan et al., 2005).",

            "text": "Coronaviruses have a limited host range and tissue tropism, which is determined by the interaction of the viral S glycoprotein with a receptor protein on the surface of susceptible cells (Bosch et al., 2003, Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001). A variety of cellular receptors for coronaviruses, which include carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and aminopeptidase N (APN), have been identified (Delmas et al., 1992, Li et al., 2003, Williams et al., 1991, Yeager et al., 1992). Most members in the group 1 coronavirus, human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E), feline infectious peritonitis (FIPV), canine coronavirus (CCoV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), use the APN of their natural host species as a functional receptor for virus entry (Delmas et al., 1992, Kolb et al., 1998, Li et al., 2007, Tresnan et al., 1996, Yeager et al., 1992). APN, also known as CD13, is a 150-kDa type II glycoprotein that belongs to a membrane-bound metalloprotease family (Kenny and Maroux, 1982, Lendeckel et al., 2000, Look et al., 1989). The APN glycoprotein is predominantly expressed on the surface of epithelial cells of the kidney, small intestine, and respiratory tract, where the protein can be cleaved by trypsin into two N-terminal (95 kDa) and C-terminal (50 kDa) subunits (Kenny and Maroux, 1982, Lendeckel et al., 2000). In addition to its use as the major receptor for group 1 coronaviruses, APN serves as a zinc-dependent protease mediating the cleavage of the N-terminal amino acids from active peptides through the HELAH motif for enzymatic activity (Jongeneel et al., 1989, Lendeckel et al., 2000).",

Both viral pathogens commonly replicate in the differentiated enterocytes of the small intestine and accordingly, cause similar clinical symptoms with lethal watery diarrhea and dehydration in piglets (Pensaert and Yeo, 2006, Sanchez et al., 1992). Furthermore, they are both known to use porcine APN (pAPN) as a cellular receptor to gain virus entry (Delmas et al., 1992, Li et al., 2007). Despite using the same receptor, strikingly distinct cultured cell lines are employed for virus growth in vitro: PEDV could be adapted and cultivated in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells but could not be grown in swine testis (ST) cells that weakly express native pAPN, while TGEV can be propagated in ST cells (Delmas et al., 1992, Hofmann and Wyler, 1988, Li et al., 2007). Although the mechanism underlying this notable discrepancy has not yet been deciphered, it is tempting to speculate that the expression level of pAPN may be involved in PEDV infection.",

However, the cell culture system to propagate each virus is noticeably distinct in that attempts of PEDV infection in the porcine cells, including TGEV-susceptible ST cells, have been unsuccessful (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988). Thus far, our understanding of this observation is still poor, but the pAPN expression level on the surface of ST cells has been suggested to be involved in PEDV infection. In order to study the role of receptor density on PEDV infection, the sub-lines of ST cells were generated to overexpress wild-type recombinant pAPN or six histidine tagged-pAPN under the control of a retroviral LTR promoter. The established cell clones (ST-pAPN) were first subjected to RT-PCR to detect pAPN expression at the mRNA level followed by nucleotide sequencing. We failed to amplify the full-length native pAPN from normal ST cells, but were able to identify a pAPN gene of approximately 3 kb from the ST-pAPN cell clones (data not shown). Next, pAPN expression at the protein level was confirmed by western blot and consequently, one ST-pAPN cell line that highly expressed pAPN was chosen for subsequent experiments. We identified the constitutive overexpression of the 150 kDa pAPN in ST-pAPN and its increased expression level with time, demonstrating high level expression and accumulation of pAPN (Fig. 1A). The ST-pAPN cell line was further examined for the cell surface expression of pAPN by FACS analysis and immunofluorescence. As with the previous study, the normal ST cells exhibited minimal expression of the endogenous surface pAPN protein (Fig. 1C). In contrast, a significantly high level of pAPN expression on the plasma membrane was observed in ST-pAPN cells when compared to the control and even normal ST cells (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, the specific cell surface staining was clearly evident when ST-pAPN cells were incubated with the polyclonal anti-pAPN antibody without permeabilization, whereas no fluorescence was observed in normal ST cells, confirming the stable high-level surface expression of the pAPN protein (Fig. 1B). All the cells consistently showed specific fluorescent signals, indicating a homogenous population of cells expressing pAPN. In addition, the ST-pAPN-His cell lines stably expressing his-tagged recombinant pAPN were constructed to confirm the importance of the pAPN density for PEDV infection and subsequently, the high-level expression of the his-tagged protein was demonstrated by the same methods as described above with both anti-pAPN and anti-his tag antibodies (data not shown). We also created an ST cell line (ST-Neo) with the empty retroviral vector pFB-Neo and found the same expression property of pAPN that resulted in nonsusceptibility of ST-Neo cells to PEDV as confirmed in a normal ST cell line (data not shown). In subsequent studies, thus, the normal ST cells were used as a negative control.",

In normal ST cells, PEDV inoculation did not produce any visible CPE, confirming the absence of virus infectivity (Fig. 2A). In contrast, similar to virus-infected Vero cells, visible CPE appeared in ST-pAPN cells infected with PEDV at 2 days post-infection and became predominant by 3 days post-infection (Fig. 2A, upper panels). The specificity of CPE was confirmed by RT-PCR to amplify the PEDV N gene and by immunofluorescence using the N-specific MAb (Fig. 2A and B). At 2 days post-infection, N-specific staining was shown in many cell clusters indicating infection and the spread of the virus to the neighboring cells (Fig. 2A, middle panels). Next, virus infectivity was further demonstrated by western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2C, newly synthesized viral S and N proteins were clearly detected in PEDV-infected ST-pAPN cells (lane 6), indicating permissiveness to virus replication due to pAPN overexpression. The yield of the virus produced after PEDV infection in ST-pAPN cells was also assessed using the plaque assay. Upon PEDV infection, a typical titer was determined to be 1.5\u20134 \u00d7 104\n PFU/ml in ST-pAPN cells. To obtain further evidence on the involvement of cellular receptor density in productive virus infection, we attempted to test PEDV infection in ST cells constitutively expressing the his-tagged recombinant pAPN (ST-pAPN-His). Likewise, the ST-pAPN-His cells were also demonstrated to be fully permissive to the growth of PEDV as evidenced by the detection of the vial genome and proteins (Fig. 2). In contrast, other stable ST cell lines that express low levels of pAPN showed inefficient virus production and peak viral titers did not exceed 100 PFU/ml in those cells that was more than 2 logs lower than those observed in ST-pAPN cell lines highly expressing pAPN. These results indicate that the density of pAPN is a critical factor for PEDV replication. Interestingly, while typical CPEs with syncytia formation due to cell fusions were observed in the infected Vero cells in the presence of trypsin, virus infection in stable ST-pAPN cell lines induced obviously distinct CPEs with accumulation of the lytic cells (Fig. 2A, upper panels). Taken together, our data demonstrated that exogenous introduction of recombinant pAPN truly makes non-permissive ST cells susceptible to PEDV infection.",

In order to address this question, we tried to construct the enzymatic site-null mutant pAPN (pAPN-H383/387Q) by using PCR-directed mutagenesis to change the two histidines of the motif HELAH to glutamines at amino acid positions 383 and 387 of pAPN. Using the resulting construct, an ST cell line stably expressing a mutated form of pAPN was established and named ST-pAPN-H/Q. To identify the mutant pAPN expression at the mRNA level, RT-PCR and nucleotide sequencing were conducted by using the generated ST-pAPN-H/Q cell clones. The results showed successful introduction of the mutated pAPN into ST cells (data not shown). Overexpression of the mutant pAPN-H383/387Q protein was further confirmed by western blot analysis with polyclonal mouse antiserum to pAPN. As shown in Fig. 3A, the expression level of the mutated protein in ST-pAPN-H/Q cells was almost equal to the wild-type pAPN in ST-pAPN cells (lanes 1 and 3). The immunofluorescence assay further exhibited the strong cell surface signals of the enzymatic motif-null pAPN protein (data not shown). Thus, these data indicated that mutations in the enzymatic motif did not alter the expression density and the cellular localization of pAPN.",

Non-involvement of the enzymatic activity during PEDV infection in ST-pAPN cells was thus assessed using three blockers of membrane-bound APN, bestatin, 2,2\u2032-dipyridyl, and 1,10-phenanthroline. Bestatin is a small inhibitory molecule that binds competitively to the catalytic site of APN (Rich et al., 1984, Yeager et al., 1992). The remaining two inhibitors of APN activity, 2,2\u2032-dipyridyl, and 1,10-phenanthroline, are known as zinc-chelating agents that alter the confirmation of the APN epitope, thereby preventing virus attachment (Vallee and Auld, 1990, Yeager et al., 1992). The inhibitory effect of individual compounds on virus replication was examined in the infected cells in the presence or absence of each blocker by immunoperoxidase staining using the N-specific MAb. As shown in Fig. 5A, efficient production of the infectious virus was again demonstrated in ST-pAPN cells infected with PEDV without drug treatment. In comparison to untreated infected cells, however, the number of N-specific staining-positive cells representing PEDV replication was dramatically reduced in cells treated with the drugs 2,2\u2032-dipyridyl, and 1,10-phenanthroline, showing efficient inhibition of viral infection (Fig. 5C and D). In contrast, many clusters of PEDV-specific staining as seen in untreated infected cells were still retained in the bestatin-treated infected cells, suggesting no inhibitory effect of the drug on virus replication (Fig. 5B). Altogether, the data indicated that only the compound that effectively blocked the active site of APN was unable to display the ability to prevent virus production, demonstrating that APN enzymatic activity is non-essential for the process of infection.",

The presence of a specific receptor(s) on the host cell surface is thus a major factor that determines the species specificity and tissue tropism of viruses. Although evolutional diversities exist among different hosts or virus strains in the same virus family, employment of the viral receptor to enter the host cell seems to be selectively preserved. In contrast, members in the coronavirus family tend to show a variety of receptor usages depending on viral groups and species. Most group 1 coronaviruses use the host APN as a functional receptor to gain entry into cells (Delmas et al., 1992, Kolb et al., 1996, Tresnan et al., 1996, Yeager et al., 1992). HCoV-NL63 in group 1 and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in group 2 recognize human ACE2 to mediate virus entry (Hofmann et al., 2005, Li et al., 2003). In group 2 coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) utilizes CEACAM1, whereas HCoV-OC43 and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) use N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid as a cellular receptor determinant (Williams et al., 1991, Schwegmann-Wessels and Herrler, 2006). Therefore, coronaviruses appear to adopt various strategies to recognize the appropriate receptor for attachment to the natural host.",

            "text": "The group 1 coronavirus contains two swine-specific enteropathogenic coronaviruses, TGEV and PEDV, which utilize pAPN as the major receptor for gaining virus entry. However, the cell culture system to support virus propagation is absolutely distinct since porcine cell lines including ST cells, which can be infected by TGEV, generally do not permit PEDV replication. The pAPN protein was originally identified as a functional receptor for TGEV in the ST cell extract, indicating pAPN expression in ST cells and thereby demonstrating the pAPN receptor usage of TEGV to enter ST cells (Delmas et al., 1992). Thus, because of the presence of pAPN on the ST cell surface, nonsusceptibility of ST cells to PEDV infection has been thought to be remarkably unusual. Since pAPN expression is known to be relatively weak in nonpermissive ST cells, one potent theory to explain such an observation that was applied in this study was that efficient virus replication seems to be associated with the expression level of pAPN on the cell surface. The current study was therefore conducted to investigate the role of the PEDV receptor density in virus infection. To do so, stable cell lines overexpressing the recombinant pAPN protein were first established using ST cells, which express a low level of native pAPN. Our experiments showed that constitutive overexpression of pAPN is capable of rendering nonpermissive ST cells permissive to efficient PEDV infection. Furthermore, ST cell lines highly expressing pAPN mainly used in this study exhibited more efficient virus production compared with other cell lines that express relatively low levels of pAPN but higher levels than the normal ST cells. Theses data provide evidence that high pAPN receptor density beneficially contributes to the efficient production of infectious viruses. However, Delmas et al. (1995) have previously reported the contrary observations in the same cells infected with TGEV. The results of the previous study indicated that overexpression of pAPN in ST cells impairs the production of TGEV particles, whereas Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells expressing low or large amount of pAPN fail to produce infectious particles. In contrast, the other study revealed that MDCK cells transiently expressing pAPN are capable of supporting PEDV infection (Li et al., 2007). Thus, it appears that the presence of other undetermined cell-specific factor(s) may reflect an inverse function of the pAPN expression level observed in TGEV-infected ST-APN cells. The characteristic CPE observed in Vero cells infected with PEDV in the presence of trypsin consists of vacuolation and formation of syncytia with up to 100 nuclei (Pensaert and Yeo, 2006). However, ST-pAPN cells infected with the virus produced cytopathology markedly distinguishable from that of infected Vero cells. Although the exact reason for this result remains undetermined, the striking difference in CPEs appears to be due to the induction of cell lysis by PEDV multiplication in specific cell type(s) such as ST cells in the absence of trypsin that became susceptible to virus infection by high-level expression of recombinant pAPN on their surface.",

It is expressed on the epithelial cell surface of various tissues at different levels. More generally, APN is abundantly expressed in the brush border membrane of the small intestine and the kidney, whereas its expression is detected to a lesser extent in the liver, lung, and colon (Kenny and Maroux, 1982, Lendeckel et al., 2000). Remarkably, the aminopeptidase represents about 8% of the total protein content of the differentiated enterocytes in the small intestine mucosa (Delmas et al., 1992, Kenny and Maroux, 1982). As for natural PEDV infection, viral multiplication occurs in the cytoplasm of villous epithelial cells throughout the small intestine (Pensaert and Yeo, 2006). Moreover, the PEDV-induced histopathological lesions in piglets are only restricted to the small intestine (Pensaert and Yeo, 2006). The pathology of PEDV is thus noticeably consistent with the tissue distribution of pAPN. In the present study, the amounts of pAPN expressed in the established ST-pAPN cell lines are presumably similar to in vivo situation and consequently appear to be sufficient to lead to the growth of PEDV as with natural infection. It is also shown that in infected pigs, the site of TGEV multiplication is matched to tissues mainly distributing the receptor, such as the small intestine. However, ST cells that minimally express pAPN are known to be fully permissive to the growth of TGEV in vitro. Unlike PEDV, therefore, TGEV infection seems to be much less confined by the pAPN receptor density at least in vitro. Nevertheless, in addition to the virus\u2013receptor interactions, the receptor density on the plasma membrane of target cells could be another factor contributing to virus tropisms.",

Another set of experiments was thus performed to examine whether the protease activity of pAPN is relevant to PEDV infection. We generated an ST cell line constitutively expressing the mutant pAPN, which was stripped of its enzyme activity by mutating the metalloprotease active motif. It was confirmed that the catalytic site mutation had no effects on the expression level and subcellular distribution of the pAPN protein. As with wild-type pAPN, the mutant enzyme activity-null pAPN was still able to retain the receptor activity. Furthermore, our data demonstrated that the only inhibitor blocking the APN active site was incapable of preventing PEDV replication, indicating that the proteolytic function of pAPN is non-relevant to the receptor activity in PEDV infection. This conclusion was somewhat expected since similar results have been obtained in previous studies with other coronaviruses, HCoV-29E and TGEV, which have also shown non-interference of the APN enzymatic activity in viral replication (Delmas et al., 1994, Yeager et al., 1992). Otherwise, it is interesting to note that small compounds inducing conformational changes in pAPN were found to be unfavorable to mediate virus entry. This finding further implicates the potential usefulness of these drugs as antiviral agents to treat acute PED infection.",

            "text": "In the present study, we cannot rule out a possible mechanism to explain the growth of PEDV on the monkey kidney-derived Vero cells. Shibata et al. (2000) have showed that PEDV is able to efficiently replicate in cultured cells directly prepared from the porcine kidney, where high pAPN density has been reported. Given the strict host tropism of PEDV for pigs, however, it has been unexpected that the virus could infect the monkey kidney cells. It is noteworthy that this cell line also permits replication of SARS-CoV through the specific binding of the viral S protein to the receptor molecule ACE2 on Vero cells (Ksiazek et al., 2003, Li et al., 2003). It is unclear if monkey APN (mAPN) is expressed in Vero cells and can be used as a functional receptor for PEDV infection. Although feline APN (fAPN) has been known to serve as a receptor for several group 1 coronavirus, the interaction between their S protein and the pAPN receptor generally acts in a species-specific manner (Tresnan et al., 1996, Wentworth and Holmes, 2001). For example, pAPN serves as a receptor for the porcine coronaviruses but not for HCoV-229E and vice versa (Delmas et al., 1994, Kolb et al., 1996). Furthermore, pAPN has only 78% amino acid identity to mAPN with the introduction of five gaps, whereas human APN (hAPN) shares 96% similarity to mAPN with one deletion residue. It is therefore unlikely possible that the PEDV S protein can recognize mAPN on Vero cells to gain virus entry. Rather, it hints at the presence of additional factors such as unidentified receptors or receptor-independent infection that may contribute to the permissiveness of Vero cells to PEDV infection.",

Additionally, the current study revealed that the function of pAPN as a protease is irrespective of the process of PEDV infection. From this observation, we deduced that the molecular determinants necessary for the PEDV\u2013receptor interaction appear to reside within a pAPN domain distinct from the catalytic site. However, more detailed studies are needed to dissect pAPN domains in order to determine the specific region that binds to the S protein during the PEDV\u2013pAPN interaction. An alternative approach can be devised to construct a truncated soluble form of pAPN that may also interfere with viral replication. Finally, the insights obtained from this work will facilitate identification of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the PEDV S protein that can induce potent neutralizing antibodies. These next tasks will undoubtedly provide promising data to enable the development of antiviral agents and an effective and safe subunit vaccine for the prevention of PEDV infection.",
