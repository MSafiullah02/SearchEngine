The genome of SINV consists of an approximately 11.7-kb single-stranded RNA molecule of positive polarity, which is capped at its 5 \u2032 end and polyadenylated (polyA) at its 3 \u2032 end [3] . Early during infection, the polymerase complex uses the plussense genomic RNA to synthesize a full-length minus strand complement. The minus strand in turn is used as the template for the synthesis of daughter full-length plusstrand (49S) mRNA. In addition, the minus strand is used as template for the transcription of a smaller or subgenomic (26S) mRNA. Transcription of the 26S mRNA initiates at an internal site, known as the subgenomic promoter (SP) [4, 5] . This subgenomic mRNA is identical to the 3 \u2032 third of the genomic RNA that encodes the virus' structural proteins [3] , which are required for progeny virion production.",

Two elements spanning positions -40 to -20 and +6 to +14 were found to be required for full promoter activity, and they act synergistically to enhance transcription [7] .

However, no cytopathic phenotype was observed in BHK-21 cells infected with RNA transcripts from pBR-XJ11 or pBR-XJ21 with an SINV minimal SP (-19 to +5). To further examine the effects of the designed promoter on the propagation of XJ-160, growth curves of the recombinant viruses were constructed in BHK-21 cells. As shown in figure 2 , compared with XJ-160 virus, slightly higher titers of XJ-12 or XJ-13 virus were detected at 8-48 h p.i. In contrast, lower titers of XJ-14 or XJ-15 virus were consistently detected during infection. The growth curve from XJ-21 to XJ-25 virus carrying GLUC and designed SPs had similar characteristics to that of the XJ-11 to XJ-15, respectively (data not shown). In addition, the growth tendencies of the mutant viruses were similar to that of XJ-160 virus. For evaluating the difference between the wild-type virus and mutant viruses, significant differences were performed using the oneway ANOVA analysis function in the SPSS software package (release 12.1; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Ill., USA). Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. These results indicate that the minimal SINV SP had no activity in XJ-160 virus, and that substitution of the T for A at -18 had no marked effect on the secretion of replicated virions, and slightly enhanced the propagation capacity of XJ-160 virus. In contrast, the differences between the mutant viruses with mutation at +40 (XJ-14 and XJ-15) and XJ-160 virus were statistically significant at all indicated time points (p < 0.05), suggesting that deletion or substitution of the T at +49 significantly decreased viral propagation capacity.",

Specific green fluorescence was observed in BHK-21 cells transfected with XJ-12 to XJ-15 virus, while no EGFP expression was observed following transfection with pBR-XJ11 ( fig. 3 a) , confirming the nonfunction of the SINV minimal SP in XJ-160 virus. In BHK-21 cells infected with XJ-12 or XJ-13 virus, continuously enhanced fluorescence could be seen 24-72 h p.i.; the EGFP expression peak was found at 48 h p.i. On the passaging of XJ-12 to XJ-15, EGFP expression was observed in cells infected with repeated passages of XJ-12 or XJ-13 virus, while no specific green fluorescence was observed after XJ-14 or XJ-15 virus had been passaged three times (data not shown). Similarly, continuously high luciferase activity was detected in BHK-21 cells infected with repeated passages of XJ-22 or XJ-23 virus, while only background levels of luciferase were detected after XJ-24 or XJ-25 virus was passaged However, passage 1 of XJ-24 or XJ-25 virus exhibited significantly higher GLUC activity than the following passages of the corresponding virus (p < 0.05). These results further demonstrate the distinct effects of the two T nucleotides in the 26S mRNA promoter on the infectivity of XJ-160 virus. For some positive-stranded RNA viruses, including picornaviruses and flaviviruses, genomic RNA is the only viral mRNA synthesized in infected cells. For many other positive-stranded RNA viruses, including alphaviruses and coronaviruses, one or more subgenomic RNAs are also synthesized in infected cells. Two distinct mech-anisms for generating subgenomic RNAs have been identified. First, subgenomic RNA synthesis by coronaviruses involves discontinuous RNA synthesis [11] . The second is the initiation of transcription at an internal site called an SP on the minus strand of the genomic RNA. The second mechanism is the most clearly established in alphaviruses [6, 12, 13] and the plant virus brome mosaic virus (BMV) [14, 15] . Thus, binding between RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) and SP may be a major contributor to the transcription of 26S mRNA. nsP4, which has been identified as the Sindbis viral RDRP, is highly conserved in the genus Alphavirus , and plays a major role in viral RNA replication [16, 17] . nsP4 also recognizes the SP, and the specific amino acid sequence in nsP4 responsible for recognizing SP is [18] . Substitution of the T for A at -18 had little effect on the activity of the SP or the characteristics of XJ-160 virus. One explanation for this is that RDRP is able to tolerate sequence changes at this position.",

Since the +49 mutation is positioned next to the initiation codon of the reporter genes, it is likely that the translatability of the second mRNA is altered by the change at the position of +49. To confirm the contribution of +49 to promoter function, virus-specific RNAs synthesized by the recombinant virus both in passage 1 and 3 were analyzed as described previously by Hertz and Huang [19, 20] . As shown in the figure 4 , all the mutant RNA transcripts produce a genomic and two subgenomic mRNAs at passage 1. Compared with XJ-11 with the substitution at -18, the levels of virus-specific RNAs from the RNA transcripts with the +49 mutation are obviously decreased at passage 3, including XJ-14, XJ-15, XJ-24 and XJ-25. Especially, two subgenomic mRNAs are hardly detected in the BHK-21 cells infected with RNA transcripts with the +49 mutation, suggesting that the contribution of +49 mutations to promoter function may be related with the translatability of the second mRNA.",

The analysis of subgenomic mRNA promoter function using a full-length cDNA clone of SINV is problematic. First, the clone is somewhat cumbersome to manipulate because of its large size and lack of unique restriction sites around the junction region. The second, and more serious, impediment is that the open reading frame of the nonstructural protein nsP4 overlaps with the initiation site for subgenomic RNA synthesis. Full-length pBR-XJ160 is 14,625 bp, and no reasonable unique restriction sites for the construction of a recombinant clone with two promoters have been found. Two unique restriction sites, a Kas I site at the 3 \u2032 -terminal end of the E1 gene and a Xho I site at the 3 \u2032 terminal of the polyA tail, were used to construct the desired clones in this study. These were generated by three long-fragment fusion PCRs and two ligation reactions. In addition, the designed SPs were placed upstream of the reporter genes, which avoided the effects of nsP4 overlap on the subgenomic mRNA promoter. In this way, we constructed competent viruses expressing EGFP or GLUC, such as XJ-12, XJ-13, XJ-22 and XJ-23. These represent a powerful tool for studying the replication strategy and pathogenetic mechanisms of alphaviruses. and 3 from the cells and were denatured and separated through 1% agarose. The gel was treated for fluorography and exposed to film. The genomic RNA (big arrow) and the two subgenomic mRNAs (small arrows) were detected.",
