The virus infection leads to 245,922 confirmed cases and 10,048 deaths worldwide as of March 20, 2020. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are lethal zoonotic viruses, highly pathogenic in nature, and responsible for diseases ranging from common cold to severe illness such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans for the past 15 years. Considering the severity of the current and previous outbreaks, no approved antiviral agent or effective vaccines are present for the prevention and treatment of infection during the epidemics. Although, various molecules have been shown to be effective against coronaviruses both in vitro and in vivo, but the antiviral activities of these molecules are not well established in humans. Therefore, this chapter is planned to provide information about available treatment and preventive measures for the coronavirus infections during outbreaks. This chapter also discusses the possible role of supportive therapy, repurposing drugs, and complementary and alternative medicines for the management of coronaviruses including COVID-19.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses belonging to the subfamily Coronavirinae and order Nidovirales . CoVs have a common genome organization and are commonly categorized as alpha CoVs, beta CoVs, gamma CoVs, and delta CoVs on the basis of genomic structures and phylogenetic relationships. In these CoVs, transmission of alpha CoVs and beta CoVs is restricted to mammals and induces respiratory illness in humans, while gamma CoVs and delta CoVs are known to affect birds and mammals (Song et al. 2019) . Even though, most CoV infections are mild, but the outbreaks of the two beta CoVs, i.e., Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), have caused more than 10,000 combined cases and 1600 deaths in last 20 years (Skariyachan et al. 2019) . The incubation period of MERS and SARS is given as 2-13 and 2-14 days, respectively, the progression of infection is rapid with MERS-CoV as compared to SARS-CoV, and the reported mortality rates were 34% and 10%, respectively Rasmussen et al. 2016) . CoVs are zoonotic in nature, which means these viruses are transmitted between animals and humans. In the same way, SARS and MARS were reported to transmit in humans from civet cats and camel, respectively (Shehata et al. 2016) . Human-to-human transmission of SARS and MARS is also reported via close personal contact with infected patients. In 2012, MERS emerged as global heath challenge in countries near the Arabian Peninsula. As of July 31, 2019, 2458 laboratory-confirmed MERS cases and 848 deaths were reported where around 80% of these cases have been reported only in Saudi Arabia (Zheng et al. 2019) . In 2003, SARS-CoV was originated in southern China and transmitted to Hong Kong and 29 other countries with high human morbidity, leading to 8098 confirmed cases and 774 deaths (Hui and Zumla 2019) .",

The virus infection leads to 245,922 confirmed cases and 10,048 deaths worldwide as of March 20, 2020 (ProMED-mail 2020 . SARS-CoV-2 and SARS are clinically similar, and recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV (Kumar et al. 2020) . The cause and spread of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak are still unclear. Preliminary research has found positive samples for WN-CoV in the wholesale market of Huanan seafood in Wuhan City, but some patients confirmed by the laboratory have not reported visiting this area (Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) 2020). Evidence is still emerging; however, information to date shows that transmission from human to human occurs. SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients leads to pneumonia-like symptoms such as fever and difficulty in breathing with radiographs showing invasive pneumonic infiltrates in few cases. The evolution of novel CoVs has been shown to be associated with RNA recombination with the existing CoVs (Andersen et al. 2020) . The coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, MERS, and SARS) infection initially spreads in adults, and the reported symptoms are fever, headache, vomiting, chills, dyspnea, nausea, sore throat, coughing up blood, shortness of breath, myalgia, diarrhea, and malaise (Table 10 .1). Severe infection leads to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sometimes multi-organ failure (Paules et al. 2020) . Coronavirus infection leads to thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and leukopenia with elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase and liver enzymes (Arabi et al. 2014 ).",

Some of these drugs are also in clinical trial for SARS-CoV-2 (Li and De Clercq 2020). In the past 2 months, drugs from various classes such as nucleoside analogs, protease inhibitors, and host-targeted agents have been tested to discover an authorized antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 10 .2).

Although, various therapeutic alternatives have been given for the management of infection such as antiviral drugs (ribavirin, lopinavir, and ritonavir), convalescent plasma, corticosteroids, monoclonal antibodies, intravenous immunoglobulin, and repurposing of existing clinically FDA-approved drugs (Totura and Bavari 2019) . The effectiveness of these drugs is not well established and given as symptomatic treatment to control the severity of infection. However, a retrospective analysis reported that ribavirin alone or in combination with interferon-alpha (IFN-\u1f00) or lopinavir or ritonavir showed increase in survival compared to patients taking supportive care and corticosteroids against MERS-CoV infection (Falzarano et al. 2013; Chu et al. 2004; Chiou et al. 2005; Loutfy et al. 2003 ). In the same way, several studies have reported that ribavirin in conjugation with fluoroquinolones and corticosteroids did not demonstrate efficacy in patients with SARS-CoV infection (Table 10 .3) (Al-Tawfiq et al. 2014; Omrani et al. 2014; Spanakis et al. 2014; Leong et al. 2004; Muller et al. 2007; Ward et al. 2005; Zhao et al. 2003) . Nevertheless, it is concluded that ribavirin alone or in combination with other drugs fails to improve patient outcome against both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections and is associated with adverse effects such as decreased hemoglobin levels, hemolytic anemia, hypoxemia, and metabolic abnormalities. In addition to ribavirin, interferons are also associated with psychiatric disturbances, neutropenia, and systemic adverse effects (Al-Dorzi et al. 2016). Drug repurposing is an eye-catching alternative approach for discovering newer drugs during the virus epidemics for a number of viral infections because various measures are typically skipped during the initial phase of drug design. Recently, researchers have investigated the antiviral potential of various approved drugs as first-line of defense against the newly emerging infectious agents. Repurposing of pharmaceutical agents could be an effective arm to develop potential therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV infection (Dyall et al. 2017 ). The drugs from various classes such as antidiarrheal agents, antimalarial agents, cyclophilin inhibitors, interferons, kinase inhibitors, neurotransmitter inhibitors, anticholinergics, nucleic acid synthesis inhibitors, protease inhibitors, protein synthesis inhibitors, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and sterol metabolism inhibitors have demonstrated in vitro and in vivo antiviral efficacy against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection (Table 10.

The spike (S) protein present in CoVs acts as a viral antigen and responsible for host-receptor binding and virus internalization and induces robust humoral and cell-mediated responses in humans during infection. The S glycoprotein has been shown to involve in the internalization of other CoVs like SARS by binding to its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The S-protein functions in the receptor binding and membrane fusion make it the ideal target for the production of vaccines against CoVs (Wang et al. 2016) . Recent experiments have shown that the S-protein vaccine can trigger antibodies to resist virus binding, fusion, and neutralization of SARS-CoV infection. Recently, Sprotein-based vaccines such as DNA vaccines, modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA)based chimeric virus vaccines, subunit vaccines, and virus-like replicon particle (VRP)-based chimeric virus vaccines have been developed, and they demonstrate protective effect against both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections in animal models (Schindewolf and Menachery 2019).",

Similarly, studies have demonstrated that traditionally used medicinal herbal extracts such as Cimicifuga rhizoma, Coptidis rhizoma, Phellodendron cortex, and Meliae cortex are also shown to inhibit CoV replication in cell culture model (Kim et al. 2008 ). Emodin, a chemical constituent of genus Rheum, and Polygonum are also shown to block the binding of SARS-CoV S-protein to ACE2 in a dosedependent manner (Ho et al. 2007 ). In the same manner, Artemisia annua, Lycoris radiate, Lindera aggregata, lycorine, and Pyrrosia lingua also showed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV (Li et al. 2005 ). In addition, saikosaponins are natural triterpene glycosides (A, B 2 , C, and D) and were tested against HCoV-22E9, and it is found that saikosaponin B 2 inhibits virus attachment and penetration stage to the host cells (Cheng et al. 2006 ). In the same way, myricetin and scutellarein act as inhibitor of SARS-CoV helicase. Similarly, theaflavin-3,3-digallate (TF3) is a natural polyphenolic compound and demonstrates antiviral activity via targeting 3C-like proteases of SARS-CoV . Eupatorium fortune is a herbal medicinal plant belonging to Korea, China, and Asian countries with antibacterial and antioxidant activities and anticancer activity. Recent studies have reported that eupatorium fortune can inhibit a number of RNA viruses including human coronaviruses (Choi et al. 2017) . As these herbal drugs demonstrated potential antiviral activity against CoVs, there is an urgent need to establish their effectiveness in humans and approve in a dose-dependent manner from various organizations like Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In the absence of specific antiviral agent or vaccine, the use of complementary and alternative drugs may found to be beneficial during humanitarian emergencies.",

The risk of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks depends on the characteristics of the virus, including the ability of the virus to transmit among humans, the seriousness of the disease, and the medical or other interventions available to prevent the transmission of virus, such as vaccines or drugs. Although, ribavirin along with corticosteroids and interferons has been tested in patients with SARS and MARS-CoV infections, but the effectiveness and associated severe adverse effects of this regimen is still not yet confirmed. In addition, a large number of drugs from different classes have been used for the management of symptoms associated with the infection and reported to have antiviral activity against both SARS and MARS-CoV infections in animal and cell culture model. However, the antiviral potential of these repurposing drugs are need to be validated in clinical trials in order to developed broad-spectrum therapy for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MARS-CoV infections.",

In the absence of specific therapeutic agent, the study of pathogenesis of infection is imperative to identify newer targets for designing of novel therapeutic agents for future outbreaks.
