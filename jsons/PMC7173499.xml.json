Group B Streptococcus is the most frequent cause of early-onset pneumonia.2 Early-onset infection due to group B Streptococcus, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, and other gram-negative bacilli can cause severe respiratory distress resembling hyaline membrane disease, usually as a part of a widespread systemic infection. Prenatal and perinatal risk factors, including preterm delivery, maternal chorioamnionitis, and rupture of membranes >18 hours, increase the risk for neonatal pneumonia.

Rhinoviruses have been recovered from culture in 22% to 27% of cases of childhood pneumonia.7 Although influenza, RSV, and hMPV are significantly associated with CAP in children, the roles of other viruses such as parainfluenza viruses, enteroviruses, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses and bocavirus are difficult to ascribe owing to dual virus detections in illness, detections in well children, and extended durations of shedding.23a In a case-control study, the latter viruses were negatively associated with CAP.24 Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), CMV, and HSV typically cause LRI in immunocompromised or very young immune-na\u00efve children. Cases of LRI due to human parechoviruses (HPeV types 1\u20134) have been reported, but a substantial role awaits description. LRI viral infections mirror general seasonality: RSV, hMPV, and influenza (winter), parainfluenza (spring and autumn), and rhinoviruses and adenoviruses (throughout the year).25\n",

Cultures of nasopharyngeal specimens are not reliable. Tracheal aspiration is useful for culture if performed with direct laryngoscopy.

Quantitative culture performed on a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimen is useful when the isolate colony count is >104/mL.

During the late 1990s in Utah, S. pneumoniae serotype 1 emerged as a virulent agent of complicated pneumonia.85 In the mid-2000s, before the introduction of PCV13, serotypes 1, 3, 7F, and 19A were detected in other areas of the US in more than half of cases of empyema in children.132, 143, 144 In many cases, S. pneumoniae was detected by PCR in fluid or blood and not by culture, especially in patients pretreated with antibiotics. In a recent study from Greece, one third of 15 children with S. pneumoniae serotype 3 pneumonia and pleural effusion had been immunized with PCV13 after 12 months of age (with the then recommended 2 doses); no case occurred in children whose immunizations began in infancy and included all 4 recommended PCV13 doses.145 Universal childhood immunization against Hib has made Hib a rare cause of parapneumonic effusion. CA-MRSA is an important cause of complicated pneumonia146, 147; in southeast Asia, S. aureus is the most common cause.148 Less frequently, group A Streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, mixed anaerobic pathogens, Mycobacterium spp. and, rarely, fungi and parasites can be the etiologic agents.149 Although effusion can accompany pneumonia due to M. pneumoniae and common viruses, they seldom are large enough to require intervention.149, 150 Parapneumonic fluid, other than in S. aureus infection, frequently is sterile, especially if the patient has received antibiotics or when the infection is caused by fastidious organisms.132, 143, 146 In such situations, PCR testing often can confirm the etiology.",

When this balance is disturbed, fluid accumulates. Transudate occurs when there are changes in the hydrostatic forces with normal capillary permeability, whereas exudate results when there is increased capillary permeability and lymphatic obstruction.152, 153 Pleural mesothelial macrophages contribute to the innate local defense against infection.154 Pathogens can gain entry into the pleural space by direct extension from the alveoli, by hematogenous spread from the skin surface through a penetrating injury, from rupture of the esophagus, or from an intra-abdominal site through the diaphragm.155 Direct extension from the alveoli is by far the most common. Certain pathogens such as S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and S. pyogenes demonstrate tropism for the pleural surface for reasons that are not well understood but that likely include virulent factors such as exotoxins, endotoxins, or attachment molecules. Exposure of the pleural mesothelial cells to lipopolysaccharide, thrombin, or bacteria can incite an innate and adaptive inflammatory response causing pleural mesothelial macrophage dysfunction.156, 157 Vascular endothelial growth factor is released, which potentiates endothelial injury, increased capillary permeability, and extravasation of pulmonary interstitial fluid into the pleural space.158 Mesothelial cells recruit neutrophils and monocytes and secrete large amounts of chemokines, including interleukin-8 (IL-8), into the pleural fluid that, when inhibited by bacterial proteins, results in an acidic, purulent fluid (i.e., empyema).159 Acidic environment of the pleural fluid both suppresses bacterial growth and interferes with antibiotic activity. With disease progression, more inflammatory cytokines are released, and there is activation of coagulation leading to deposition of fibrin.",

Blunting of the costophrenic angle, thickening of the normally paper-thin, pleural-shadow, and a subpulmonic density all suggest pleural effusion (Fig. 34.3\n). Compression of the lung, with shift of the trachea away from the effusion, may be seen when the effusion is large, usually \u22651000 mL.161 Lateral decubitus films can differentiate free effusion from loculated collections, pulmonary consolidation, and pleural thickening. Chest radiographs, however, cannot differentiate between a parapneumonic effusion and an empyema.149 Ultrasonography is the imaging modality of choice because it is portable, inexpensive, and involves no radiation exposure; differentiates parenchymal from pleural space disease; helps localize and estimate the size of an effusion precisely; identifies the best site for thoracentesis and chest tube placement; and is superior to computed tomography (CT) in detecting early loculation and septation.162 Quality of ultrasonography is dependent on level of experience of the operator. Although CT is not necessary routinely to differentiate simple parapneumonic effusion from empyema, CT may be indicated to evaluate parenchymal disease (necrotizing pneumonia or lung abscess), to determine noninfectious causes, or to aid the surgeon before thoracotomy or thoracoscopy.16\n",

Children with small, uncomplicated effusion can be managed as outpatients with an empiric antibiotic regimen as for CAP. In most hospitalized patients, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime given intravenously is recommended as empiric therapy to adequately treat S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Vancomycin is added if the patient is very ill appearing or CA-MRSA or hospital-acquired MRSA is considered a potential pathogen. In areas where CA-MRSA is highly clindamycin susceptible, clindamycin could be an adequate addition. Vancomycin has poor pharmacokinetics for infections in the lung. Other agents with good MRSA activity include linezolid, telavancin, ceftaroline, and quinupristin-dalfopristin; these agents are considered second-line treatment for patients who do not respond to vancomycin therapy. Daptomycin should not be used because it is inactivated by surfactant. In patients with suspected pneumonia aspiration, clindamycin can be used instead of vancomycin to cover anaerobic bacteria. In cases in which atypical pathogens are suspected, a macrolide (for children <7 years) or doxycycline (for children >7 years) may be added. When a specific pathogen is detected, or when the clinical course and microbiologic screening cultures make Staphylococcal infection highly unlikely, the antibiotic spectrum should be narrowed. Duration of parenteral therapy and total treatment is individualized on the basis of clinical response and adequacy of drainage. It is common practice to replace parenteral therapy with oral therapy when substantial improvement occurs and the patient has good oral intake, with continuation of antibiotics for a total course of 2 to 4 weeks for empyema.41 The treatment may be prolonged when drainage is delayed and systemic manifestations are protracted. In circumstances in which the effusion persists and the microbial etiology is unknown, it is important to remember that even with optimal antibiotic therapy, fever, anorexia, and toxicity can be due to a prolonged inflammatory response. Additions or changes in appropriately selected antibiotic therapy should be avoided.",

It is important not to drain fluid too rapidly because reexpansion pulmonary edema can occur, causing increased morbidity and even mortality.175 The course is observed over 48 to 72 hours. Many patients improve. If the patient does not improve or worsens, ultrasonography is performed to determine the extent of reaccumulation. If fluid has reaccumulated, continuous drainage is required; if not, an antibiotic regimen is reconsidered. For patients with a large effusion or patients with respiratory compromise, a chest tube is placed as soon as possible for continuous drainage. A small bore chest tube is preferable for patient comfort and was associated with shorter hospital stay and found to be superior to surgical stiff drains in two studies.176, 177 Chest radiography is repeated to verify chest tube placement and to exclude the development of pneumothorax during placement. Complications of chest tube placement include bleeding or infection at the exit site, persistent atelectasis, development of bronchopleural fistula, or (very rarely) laceration of the lung.178\n",

Duration of therapy is based on clinical response and usually is 4 weeks, or at least 2 weeks after the patient becomes afebrile and has clinical improvement. In most cases, parenteral therapy is initiated. Two randomized clinical trials in adults found clindamycin to be superior to penicillin for the treatment of anaerobic lung abscess.123, 212, 213 A randomized clinical trial for treatment of children with aspiration pneumonia found no difference between these two drugs. Ampicillin-sulbactam has an excellent spectrum of activity against organisms in aspiration lung abscesses.214 Parenteral clindamycin is appropriate empiric therapy in children with complicated lung infection possibly due to S. aureus or CA-MRSA. Vancomycin is an alternative in patients with allergy or where clindamycin resistance of S. aureus is prevalent. Other antistaphylococcal medications, such as linezolid, could be used in case of allergy or poor response to vancomycin or clindamycin.215 Combination therapy with ticarcillin or piperacillin and a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor (e.g., tazobactam) with or without an aminoglycoside may be considered when necrotizing pneumonia follows aspiration in a hospitalized child or in a child for whom an Enterobacteriaceae (e.g., E. coli, Klebsiella spp.) or P. aeruginosa infection is suspected or has been identified from a percutaneous lung aspirate. Metronidazole would be effective treatment for \u03b2-lactamase\u2013producing anaerobes in lung abscess after aspiration but cannot be used alone without an agent active against aerobic and microaerophilic streptococci.216\n",
