            "text": "In 2001, The Journal of Asian Studies published an article titled \u201c Peking Man and the Politics of Paleoanthropological Nationalism in China\u201d by Barry Sautman. It attempted to divert scholarly attentions on Chinese nationalism in post-Mao China from the focus on \u201c\u2018high politics\u2019 or the foreign policy of party-state elites\u201d to more cultural and social trends by examining a state-sponsored discourse that adapted a body of complex scholarship of both the archeology and the anthropology of the Stone Age to identify the Chineseness personified by Peking Man. Sautman\u2019s research played a pioneering role in the discussion by establishing some key arguments and analytical concepts. He agreed with some scholars\u2019 preliminary observation that in a time of racial nationalism\u2019s retreat in most major states, Chinese nationalism had shown more \u201cofficial efflorescence\u201d expressed in the concept of blood ties. As he stated: \u201cOfficial PRC paleoanthropology undergirds a Chinese patriotism that resonates with a folk taxonomy that understands \u2018 race\u2019 as an evident, natural, fundamental, pervasive, omni-historical, and biologically significant division of the world\u2019s people.\u201d The so-called \u201cpolitics of paleoanthropological nationalism\u201d was its manifestation. Sautman defined this politics of paleoanthropological nationalism in the Chinese rejection of the internationally accepted Out-of-Africa theory regarding the monogenetic origin of modern humans by insisting on a polygenetic origin to support an independent progenitor of H. sapiens in China. Behind this nationalist assertion of a native origin was a bolder \u201c Sinocentric evolutionary theory\u201d held by some Chinese scholars. Sautman\u2019s data were mainly drawn from scholarly discussions, media reports, and talks by high-ranking leaders\u2019. Sautman convincingly revealed a strong consciousness among Chinese scholars of the political sensitivity attached to the discussion on fossils, and he dialectically portrayed the nationalist Peking Man narrative as \u201ca kind of reverse teleology, in which the present-day nation is projected as the inevitable consequence of evolution\u201d ( Sautman 2001, p. 104). For Sautman, this Chinese discourse was a pronounced case of racial nationalism, which \u201cholds that each of us can trace our identities to a discreet community of biology and culture whose \u2018essence\u2019 has been maintained through time\u201d ( Sautman 2001, p. 95).",

Such a political agenda in the PRC established a human identity free from the influence of the Christian creation myth and folk religious superstitions regarding the origin and evolution of mankind, and helped to promote socialist ethics that exalted physical work by using Peking Man\u2014believed to have been able to use tools\u2014as an example of what Frederick Engels argued in his The Part Played by Labor in the Transition from Ape to Human. This official effort in popular science to some extent led Schmalzer to arrive at the conclusion that it was in the early years of the PRC that Peking Man\u2019s status as the national ancestor was officially established, despite the fact that prior to 1949 some propagandists of the Nationalist regime had ventured to do so out of nationalist political agenda.

In tracing the construct of the discourse of a historical China in lineage and space to define and defend China as a legitimate nation state against the odds of a historical complex of changing and often ambiguous territorial and ethnic lines, James Leibold engages Peking Man in his articles \u201cCompeting Narratives of Racial Unity in Republican China: From the Yellow Emperor to Peking Man\u201d (2006, \u201cCompeting Narrative\u201d hereafter) and \u201cFilling in the Nation: The Spatial Trajectory of Prehistoric Archaeology in Twentieth-Century China\u201d (2012, \u201cFilling in the Nation\u201d hereafter). They involve the late Qing dynasty and the PRC, but focus on the Nationalist era, a time critical to the transition from a multi-ethnic empire to a modern nation state. This transition was notably disrupted by Japan\u2019s encroachment and invasions in the 1930s, which made Peking Man a timely and meaningful discovery for Chinese nationalism. Leibold\u2019s interpretation gets more to a reading of a racial national identity that Peking Man was appropriated to establish.",

In the 1930s and 1940s, many Chinese nationalist scholars had suggested that Peking Man was the common progenitor of all the peoples in China.

The driving force of this paradigm shift was the discovery of more early hominid evidence in Asia and had nothing to do with Chinese nationalism, but its result was read and exploited by the latter which helped to construct a national identity with racial implications.

First, it emphasizes that since the 1990s, Peking Man\u2019s assumed ancestorship of the Chinese people has been further valorized as a symbol in state-sanctioned patriotic mobilization, instead of a mainly paleoanthropological interpretation in nationalist discourse. Evidence points to a deep-seated consciousness existing even among the top leaders of the Chinese being the most evolutionarily advanced human species among the world\u2019s populations. Second, it focuses on Chinese discussions on genetic challenges to this ancestorship and sets the challenge in the historical context of China\u2019s participation in the international Human Genome Project (HGP) in the late 1990s and early 2000s to give an understanding of the provocation of the debate as well as the actions taken by the Chinese state and scientific community. Third, while acknowledging the archeological ground for the China-origin Chinese (COC) theory, the chapter nonetheless reveals in detail the academic debate between the two theories regarding the origin of people. While geneticists in general hold a belief in Africa-originated Chinese (AOC), anthropologists continue to defend the COC theory. The debate has carried and enhanced political sensitivity as a result of the discourse strategies employed. In other words, the issue is scientific (there is indeed archeological evidence in favor of the COC theory), but the way it is addressed in many situations reads in a political way. Fourth, the chapter shows how lay supporters of both the AOC and COC theories fully understand the nationalist implications immersed in such a professional debate and have engaged each other in a public discussion through various media channels. This new phenomenon reflects the sociopolitical impact of scientific debates in a time of mass media and social media, and is analyzed in light of a broader national ideological divide between ultranationalists and liberal-oriented groups. Chinese society\u2019s more diverse attitude towards Peking Man, as Schmalzer emphasized, now includes a potent internationalist antidote to the nationalist stimulant.",

The fact that society scientifically accepts the AOC theory cannot obscure the fact that the COC theory still serves the nationalist agenda. On the contrary, the coexistence of the two facts only enhances the tension within Chinese nationalist politics, and forces COC advocates to seek a more effective discourse strategy that often appeals to concepts and terminologies that are more racialized or simply racist when judged by international standards. Inspired by international studies of similar discourses dubbed such as H. europaeus, H. alpinus, and H. israelensis, which constructed various imagined ancestors who bequeathed essentialized communal traits to their posterity, this Chinese discourse can be called \u201cH. sinensis,\u201d with a much more prehistoric and therefore biological root to it. Mystifying its association with the land, this H. sinensis collaborates with the rising racial nationalism expressed in pop music introduced and analyzed in the previous chapter which epitomizes Chineseness with explicit racial taxonomies.

It has risen in defiance of a cutting-edge scientific challenge in the context of China\u2019s participation in the Human Genome Project (HGP) that enhanced the debate between geneticists and anthropologists with public repercussions. The HGP was launched in 1990 by the United States and comprised four developed nations. By decoding and mapping all the genes in the human genome, this post-Cold War global collaboration had an immense impact on the determination and preservation of human genetic distinction and diversity, therefore its results can also be read as \u201ca history book\u2014a narrative of the journey of our species through time\u201d (National Human Genome Research Institute 2012). This \u201chistory book\u201d opens with a single African-origin H. sapiens as the ancestor of all modern humans and goes on to provide genetic interpretations (including migration and interbreeding, among other factors) for the racial and ethnic differences of all peoples in the world.",

Key to this affiliation was Tan Jiazhen, a founding figure of Chinese genetics who studied at Caltech in the 1930s with Thomas Hunt Morgan, the father of modern genetics. In the 1950s, after returning to China, Tan resisted Soviet criticism of genetics\u2014especially Morgan\u2019s theory\u2014as Western bourgeois science and strove for the survival of the science in China.3 He urged the Chinese state to join the HGP in the 1990s by using his contacts among Chinese leaders,4 and succeeded in getting Fudan\u2014his home institution\u2014to become the southern center for China\u2019s genomic research. He also helped to connect China\u2019s young geneticists to the international scientific community. Among those scholars, the most important figures include Jin Li, a geneticist trained in the United States and a research scientist at the Human Genetics Center, University of Texas-Houston (HGUT) in the late 1990s; Chu Jiayou, from the Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, who was also a visiting scholar in the United States in the 1990s; and Su Bin, a postdoctoral fellow at HGUT in the late 1990s. Their international connections made them more aware of the relationship between the Out-of-Africa theory and the HGP, and they also knew that the data supporting that theory did not cover China.5 Intrigued by the contradiction between this international mainstream science and their nationalist belief, they saw Chinese participation as an opportunity to test both.",

Branches of the social sciences and humanities have also felt the impact with nationalist and ethnic nationalist implications. One such field is that of linguistics. Quentin Atkinson\u2019s hypothesis that the phoneme roots of many native languages can be traced back to Africa\u2014an evolutionary linguistic school inspired by the Out-of-Africa theory\u2014is echoed among Chinese linguists in their search for the origin of the Chinese language (Yao 2010). Ethnography has become more prominent in ethnic studies as molecular anthropology has become more popular, diverting attention from textual and material culture analysis to lab results of population genetic surveys, leading to the reinterpretation of the origin and migration of many ethnic minority peoples and their relations with the Han and the Han-dominated state (Jin and Chu 2006, pp. 227\u2013240). One intriguing result is the discussion on the demic-diffusion model of Han expansion in southern China\u2014as opposed to the traditional cultural diffusion model, i.e., Han expansion resulted from non-Han peoples\u2019 adoption of more civilized Han culture\u2014which shows a predominant pattern of a DNA mix of Han-males and non-Han females in southern China\u2019s Han population. This result was also first published by (Wen et al., September 16, 2004). By interpretation, this could suggest a tantalizing concept of a longue dur\u00e9e internal gender-based colonization.",

Most COC advocates such as Pei Wenzhong (the discoverer of the first Peking Man skull in 1929), Jia Lanpo, and Yang Zhongjian (coordinator of Zhoukoudian\u2019s excavation in the 1930s), were trained on site by Western anthropologists and then became elders in the IVPP.

Wolpoff and the Australian Alan G. Thorne (1939\u20132012) ( Wolpoff et al. 1984). Wu has since maintained that \u201cfour main races in the world all linked to a more archaic human species in their respective locations, all native born\u201d (Wu 2003). Wu told the newspaper that fossils were the most direct evidence while DNA was indirect and fragmentary.7 As he stated, \u201cOver the last 50 years, Chinese archaeologists have found many sites of paleoanthropological fossils and more than a thousand locations of Paleolithic culture remains. [They show] that there were no discontinuities between H. erectus, represented by Peking Man, and the modern Chinese, and [the evolution was] an \u2018expansion like a river network with small amount of interbreeding\u2019\u201d (Huashengbao, June 15, 2000). Three months later in an article titled \u201cIs Peking Man Still Our Ancestor?\u201d Wu reiterated the possibility of an incidental interbreeding between African-originated and China-evolved H. (Wu 2000). This referred to some anatomical features of H. sapiens found in China, such as round-shaped eye sockets and a projecting occipital bone, which appeared more common in Europe (Wu 2003). This revisionist reconciliation with genetics is yet to be supported by critical evidence, although geneticists have recently begun to suggest a similar scenario in regard to Neanderthal Man (Green et al., May 7, 2010; P\u00e4\u00e4bo 2014). As he was opposed to a phylogenetic tree concept of both H. erectus and H. sapiens with Africa as the common root, Wu accepted the former but insisted on his \u201criver network [meaning a multiple source of origin] with a small amount of interbreeding\u201d hypothesis for the latter\u2019s global evolution. With a multiregional evolution with incidental mixing, rather than a single African-origin mutation and replacement, Wu\u2019s model for H. sapiens has been the COC\u2019s theoretical paradigm.",

They also call attention to the difficulty in determining the relatedness between two human groups simply by matching facial and skull resemblances, which could be subject to the existing perception of the observers. More importantly, they point to a breakage of archaeological evidence in the assumed evolutionary continuity found in China. This breakage is an absence of evidence of fossils and cultural remains for the time between one hundred thousand years ago and forty thousand years ago, a key stage in which H. sapiens (early modern humans) evolved into H. sapiens sapiens (the complete modern human). As Jin Li and others have explained, this breakage is not an accident but was created by the quaternary glacier which caused the extinction of many species globally, and following which a new H. sapiens migrated from Africa and spread all over the world (Jin and Chu 2006, pp. 234\u2013235). To this, anthropologists have argued that the climate in some parts of East Asia during the Ice Age was relatively milder and because primitive humans there had been able to make fire, they might well have been able to survive the cold. Therefore the fire made in the Zhoukoudian caves once again set the ancestors of the Chinese apart from their peers elsewhere, a technical plausibility moralized in the drama. Since the debate started, the main task of anthropologists has been to find the missing link evidence that will testify to the survival of Peking Man\u2019s descendants throughout the Ice Age.",

Song is known for his role in the state-sponsored efforts to establish a credible chronology for Xia, Shang, and Zhou, the three earliest Chinese dynasties. Traditional Chinese historical chronology only recognized the year 841 BCE as the beginning of the documented history of China, established in Sima Qian\u2019s (the first and most influential figure in Chinese historiography, who lived from the second to the first century, BCE) Shi Ji (The Grand History). This year falls in the middle of the Zhou dynasty. Despite the fact that the existence of Xia and Shang as Chinese states predating Zhou had been generally accepted by historians, the specific dates of Xia, Shang, and the starting date of Zhou had remained undetermined with a very vague estimate of the twenty-third century BCE for Xia. During a state visit to Egypt, where the chronology of ancient civilization is documented with specific dates, Song was impressed and felt an urgency to do the same for Chinese history, a civilization believed to be comparable to Egypt in its antiquity. Song campaigned for an interdisciplinary effort to determine the earliest dates of those dynasties and secured millions of Chinese yuan in funding. Named the Xia, Shang, and Zhou Dynasty Chronology Project, it was completed and preliminary results were produced around 2000, which pushed back the credible time table for Chinese history to some eight hundred years earlier than that determined by Sima Qian ( Song 2009).\n",

Li, a member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee and the Chairman of the Central Spiritual Civilization Steering Committee (both 2002\u20132012), published an article under his pen name of Yong Chun in the Guangming Daily in 2012. Li\u2019s article was a result of his inspection tour to Nihewan (Yangyuan County, Hebei Province), a site of some of the earliest Paleolithic remains found in China. Before Li\u2019s visit, Liu Yunshan, the minister of the DPCCP and a member of Politburo, had visited the site and emphasized its importance for nationalist education, believing that the site shows how ancient human evolved in the \u201cEast.\u201d   (Wang, X. 2014. P. 214) With the title \u201cSome Philosophical Thoughts Regarding Human Evolution,\u201d Li started with a short explanation of the multiregional and Out-of-Africa theories regarding the origin of humans, and acknowledged the latter as the current mainstream theory. Li claims that he \u201cknows nothing about archaeology nor anthropology,\u201d but following Marxist dialectical materialism, Darwin\u2019s natural selection, and especially Lamarckian use and disuse theories, he stated his belief in the multiregional theory and strenuously argued for an evolutionarily most advanced status for the Chinese based on his analytical comparisons of the physical characteristics of the world\u2019s races. He started with an answer to the question of why the Chinese are less hairy. Early anthropoids had thick and dense hair to keep their naked bodies warm, but as they became more civilized, they came to be aware of the shame of their nudity so they began to use animal furs and tree bark and eventually textiles to cover their bodies. As a result, the function of the body being kept warm by hairs was replaced and led to its gradual loss,Therefore we can come to the conclusion that the race of the least hairy is the race of the evolutionarily most advanced. Among modern humans, white people are the most hairy, blacks next, followed by brown people, yellow people the least, and the Chinese with the least of the least. So, the Chinese must have been the racial group [\u79cd\u7fa4] that started human evolution earlier than the others. Of course, there are some groups in China who are more hairy [than others], that is perhaps the result of racial mixing.\n",

This change enabled the human body to stand upright on two legs, unlike animals that walk on four limbs. Li continued,So we can come to the conclusion that [among human races] the less protruding the buttock, the earlier upright walking started. Compared with other races, the Chinese buttock is flatter.

As anthropoids came down to the ground and used tools to work, their forelimbs were released from making heavy physical movements resulting in degenerated and shorter forelimbs. His conclusion is that the human race groups whose forelimbs are shorter started evolution earlier than those whose forelimbs are longer. Modern human\u2019s forelimbs are in general shorter than their hind legs, but different races exhibit different proportions. Then he ranked racial groups based on a comparison of the lengths of their forelimbs and hind legs, \u201cThe lengths of forelimbs and hind legs of black and brown races are the closest, the white race is next, and the yellow race is the least close.

According to some data, among the Han Chinese, only about 4% of them have armpit sniffing, while the percentage is much higher among Westerners and Africans.

In a very recent interview, Li Hui, one of Jin Li\u2019s colleagues and director of the Key Laboratory of Modern Anthropology at Fudan University, said that in 2013 Jin Li and his team collaborated with scientists from Harvard University and discovered a gene mutation that at a critical time influenced the evolution of human races. Li said, \u201cthe ancestors of our East Asian peoples entered the land of Zhonghua [today\u2019s China] from Yunnan [China\u2019s southernmost province] and they were the descendants of prehistorical human groups in West Asia. Perhaps in order to adapt to the then hot and humid climate there, a radical mutation happened in their body\u2019s EDARI [a type of gene unit]. It is an important gene that controls ectoderm.\u201d Li explained that this mutation in EDARI not only led to changes in the shape and color of hair, which later characterize East Asians, but also differentiated East Asians from Europeans in terms of perspiration. The skin tissue (determined by EDARI) of East Asians enables them to radiate body heat more through sweating, therefore East Asians often sweat more than West Asians and Europeans do. Li went further, suggesting that the result of this gene mutation can be used to explain why Westerners like to drink cold or even ice water even in winter, partly because cold water can directly lower their body temperature while East Asians like to drink hot water, regardless of the season, because it helps them to sweat. He said that when East Asians have a fever, as long as it is not very high, they can lie down and cover their body with a heavy quilt to force themselves to sweat\u2014sweating helps lower body temperature\u2014but this practice doesn\u2019t work for Westerners. Li believed that this is the reason for today\u2019s \u201cprecision treatment,\u201d a treatment considering human genetic differences and rejecting a standard or indiscriminate treatment for all types of peoples (Wu 2016).",

Rather, they merely describe different evolutionary results determined by natural circumstances, rather than being shaped by the species\u2019 conscious and goal-oriented efforts. Also, his interpretation does not suggest a relationship between the evolutionary characteristics of the species and its social and cultural traits. More importantly, in the same interview, Li stated, \u201cthe Chinese civilization did not begin to appear until 12,000 years ago when the last Ice Age ended, the climate began to turn warm, and agriculture started to develop.\u201d Therefore the evolutionary results of explaining racial differences are not read from an apparently cultural and social perspective for the purpose of constructing a unique national character and attesting to its advanced status in the human evolutionary process.",

Mao jumped into the discussion and claimed his faith in indefinite divisibility and made it clear that it was the scientific foundation for his theory of continued revolution under socialism.

Yang Jintao, an editor and popular history author for the History Channel (one of the top web portals), wrote an article about changes in perceptions of \u201cour ancestor\u201d since the late nineteenth century. He told the reader that for quite a while many late Qing and early Republican conservative intellectuals, including Liu Shipei and Zhang Taiyan (two influential anti-Qing scholars who aspired to a great Han nation), embraced a hypothesis of a Western origin for the Chinese created by Terrien de Lacouperie, a nineteenth century French orientalist. According to Lacouperie, the ancestors of the Chinese are the Babylonians. These intellectuals were fascinated by this Western-created theory of a Western origin for the Chinese, a seeming contradiction given their staunch cultural conservatism because it boosted their ethnic and racial confidence: we were descendants of the white race while the ruling Manchu were barbarians. Now, the Chinese believe that their ancestor is independent and native. Leaving the answer to the question of the AOC vs. the COC to further scientific research, Yang nonetheless suggested that changes in the perception of ancestorship reflect a change of national mentality that resulted from different circumstances of Chinese nationalism: \u201cin the late Qing, people built up their [national] confidence through seeking evidence for their Western origin, but today they hope to prove an independent origin of the Chinese\u201d ( Yang 2016).",

To promote Peking Man\u2019s archaeological site as a base for national patriotic education and commemorate those Chinese anthropologists as patriotic heroes purposefully ignores the internationalist spirit of those foreign scientists who committed themselves to Chinese archaeology and anthropology, as well as China\u2019s international prominence in these fields. Davidson Black, the leading anthropologist and chief administrator of the Zhoukoudian site in the early 1930s from whom Peking Man took its name, was so devoted to the job that he ignored the heart condition he was born with and died on site while working on the fossils (Jia 1990, p. 1). Despite the profound gratitude Chinese anthropologists hold for these foreigners, the official narrative of Peking Man, whenever unavoidable, refers to these foreigners\u2019 contributions as scientific but rarely internationalist.

Nevertheless, technical difficulties and uncertainties unsolved by the discourse aside, especially regarding how to identify Jews (who is and who is not) under different historical circumstances, Abu El-Haj argues that DNA analysis cannot be directly converted into an identity construct. The barrier between historically formed human consciousness and human bodily facts is epistemological. Abu El-Haj effectively shows how the Israeli discourse has played with genetic data, leaving behind unanswered questions reflecting ambiguity, elusiveness, and an ever-shifting emphasis caused by ignoring such a barrier. Her analysis on the problematic use of genetics in Israeli nationalism therefore provides a comparative perspective as well as a methodological tool in the critique of the use of paleoanthropological science by Chinese nationalism ( Abu El-Haj 2012).",

Huang Weiwen, a paleoanthropologist at the IVPP and an ardent supporter of Yuanmou Man\u2019s status as the ancestor of the Chinese people, visited the archaeological sites in Miyagi prefecture before the scandal was debunked. His remarks not only agreed with Fujimura\u2019s discoveries but also showed a sign of the possible collaboration between Chinese COC scholars and those Japanese anthropologists in search of an independent East Asian origin of modern humans. As he put it, \u201cthe progresses of the Chinese research and the Japanese research are like two wheels of a vehicle. We can expect that the chronology [of human evolution] based on the African-origin theory will certainly be changed in near future\u201d (Ng 2010, p. 91). Huang is a very active researcher and popular science writer. Following a suggestion by Japanese scholars, his book on Peking Man (published in 2005, after Japanese Man was debunked) is titled (\u5317\u4eac\u539f\u4eba) instead of the common Peking Man (\u5317\u4eac\u733f\u4eba). The pronunciations of \u5317\u4eac\u539f\u4eba and \u5317\u4eac\u733f\u4eba are precisely the same in the Chinese language, but the former renders the meaning of the \u201coriginal man of Beijing,\u201d thus indicating the status of ancestor and lineage while the latter literarily means \u201cthe ape man of Beijing.\u201d Interestingly, Japanese Man also literarily meant \u201c Japanese Original Man\u201d in the Japanese language as well (translated into Chinese as \u65e5\u672c\u539f\u4eba) when it was believed to be true (Huang 2002).\n",

However, the political appropriation of the COC theory shows that some classical and prototypical racial thinking persists with little alteration. Among recent discussants of racial nationalism and the myth of a unique ancestor, Maurice Olender reveals \u201ca nostalgia for old Aryanistic themes\u201d in (New School), a French school of classics, in recent decades, which can also provide a comparative perspective. Despite the notoriety of Nazi propaganda regarding the Aryan race, the attributes to the origin of Western European civilization a \u201cperfect Aryan genius\u201d of the \u201cIndo-Europeans\u201d since the Neolithic era, manifested in such traits as \u201cabstraction and metaphysics,\u201d \u201creflection,\u201d and particularly \u201ca constant tendency to subordinate the natural by integrating it into the political\u201d (Olender 2009, pp. 47, 68). A moral portrait of such a creature is also implied. These echo the Chinese discourse of ancestral genius, implied in the comprehensive behavior model, and praise of ancestral valor and virtue in anthropological and artistic languages. On the national ideological spectrum, many scholars were leaning towards \u201cvarious currents of the \u2018New Right\u2019.\u201d In China the most outspoken COC lay supporters are ultra-nationalists for whom defending a purely indigenous origin is a political cause.\n",

Similar efforts to essentialize and mystify particular human groups can also be found in the discourse about , a Swiss alpine peasant myth of \u201ca strong, healthy, hardworking, patient, perseverant, good natured but autonomous human type\u201d (Sommer 2012, p. 120).\nAbu El-Haj also dubs the Israeli construct of a pure-blood and single-ancestor Jewishness ( Abu EI-Haj 2012, pp. 99\u2013108). While these discourses involve a relatively recent time in which human civilizations had begun, the Chinese discourse dates back at least half a million years, sunken deep into pre-human natural history. \u201c ,\u201d a term invented by this author to refer to the parallel is therefore more of a legitimate name for the assumed prehistorical and transhistorical human stock with a more biological than cultural connotation.\n",

            "text": "The nationalist interpretation of the COC theory cannot be dismissed as a wild ramification of an already zealous and insular nationalism embraced only by a handful of hardcore, out of touch conservatives with its influence being inflated by social media. It is a neoracial rhetoric rooted in modern China\u2019s nationalist tradition and has collaborated with the racial discourse expressed in the popular music analyzed in the previous chapter. To conclude, Peking Man\u2019s ancestorship facilitates the national identity politics in China\u2019s rise and a racialized Chineseness as a most cohesive force. Anthony Smith\u2019s concise analysis on archaeology\u2019s role in legitimating the ethnic nation is a ready tool for a brief final analysis. All concepts in favor of \u201cthe nationalist ideal of the distinctive, territorial nation\u201d backed up by archaeology\u2019s presentation of the material culture of the past such as uniqueness, essentialism, rootedness, authenticity, indigeneity, or more tangibly, soil, lead to a construction of the \u201chistorical homeland\u201d ( Smith 2001). The political appropriation of the COC theory has extended the application of these concepts from the ethnic/cultural (measured in thousands of years) to the evolutionary/biological (measured in hundreds of thousands of years). Cultural continuity has been transformed into racial genealogy. A Chinese identity finds its ultimate origin not only in an H. erectus ancestry but also in an asserted harmony between this hominid and the natural setting. The two fuse into a habitat alien to foreigners from which \u201cmotherland/fatherland\u201d (the land is ancestrally \u201cours\u201d) and \u201cChinese territory since antiquity\u201d acquire absolute legitimacy. In the final analysis, a racial myth of a million-year-old exuberant bioenergy, called the \u201cvigorous vitality and incomparable creativity,\u201d as the current Chinese President reiterated, has become a catchphrase that distinguishes the superior Chinese from Others (Xi 2014).",
