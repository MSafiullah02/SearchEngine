The efficacy of ICIs is generally greater in cancer types with higher median numbers of somatic mutations1, which can generate neoantigens that are targets for specific CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells2. Evidence indicates that CD4+ T cell responses to MHC class II (MHC II)-restricted antigens are required for robust responses to ICIs3 and that neoantigen vaccines can enhance CD4+ T cell responses2. To develop effective neoantigen vaccines, it is essential to identify neoantigen epitopes (neoepitopes) that will bind to MHC II molecules and be presented to CD4+ T cells. Whereas the presence and expression of neoantigen proteins can be identified through sequencing of the tumour exome, the neoepitopes presented by MHC II molecules must be either discovered empirically using expensive and time-consuming mass spectrometry (MS) techniques4 or predicted using software-based estimations of peptide\u2013MHC II binding affinity.",

Racle et al.5 developed MoDec, a motif deconvolution algorithm with conceptual similarity to convolutional neural networks, to identify MHC II-binding motifs, binding core offset preferences and peptide cleavage motifs from large MS-based peptidome datasets encompassing HLA-DR, HLA-DQ and HLA-DP alleles. The deconvoluted peptidomic datasets were then used to train a prediction algorithm, MixMHC2pred, which returns an MHC II binding score for a given peptide sequence and HLA-D allele. When tested on known MHC II-binding epitopes and decoy epitopes, both the MARIA and MixMHC2pred algorithms had significantly improved predictive accuracy compared with SMN Align (P <1 \u00d7 10\u22125) and NetMHCIIpan (P <0.001), respectively5,6, which are two commonly used MHC II-binding prediction algorithms.",

However, the algorithms have different advantages. For example, MARIA incorporates tissue-specific gene-expression levels, in order to account for effects of the abundance of protein on the likelihood of peptide presentation by MHC II molecules, whereas MixMHC2pred does not. MixMHC2pred, with MoDec, used a larger training dataset (~100,000 peptides compared with ~50,000 for MARIA), encompassing more cell types, and enables the identification of peptides that bind to the different MHC II isotypes (encoded by the HLA-DR, HLA-DP and HLA-DQ genes), without retraining, whereas the MARIA benchmarks were established using versions of the algorithm trained independently for different MHC II isotypes.",

Similarly, MARIA successfully identified patient-specific neo epitopes with reactive CD4+ T cells in two of three patients with mantle cell lymphoma6. Although these datasets are small, they indicate that both algorithms can accurately predict peptides that can stimulate CD4+ T cells. One remaining hurdle, however, is that only a minority of predicted MHC II-binding peptides induced CD4+ T cell responses (8.3% (5 of 60) with MixMHC2pred and 10.8% (20 of 185) with MARIA)5,6. Notably, in the majority of previous studies, <5% of potential neoepitopes were found to stimulate T cells, even after preselection for MHC binding8. However, the absence of a T cell response should not be automatically attributed to the production of false-positive predictions by an algorithm. MHC II-binding peptides can fail to activate T cell responses for several reasons. First, the development of immunity to an MHC II-bound antigen is dependent on the presence of T cells bearing a cognate T cell receptor (TCR). T cells are able to recognize a large pool of antigens9, made more numerous by cross-reactivity10; however, with the 20 proteinogenic amino acids, 4.10 \u00d7 1015\u20133.28 \u00d7 1019 peptides comprising 12\u201315 amino acid residues (MHC II-binding peptides can contain 9\u201325 residues) could potentially exist, exceeding the number of T cells in the human body (estimated to be <1013). Therefore, few or no reactive T cells might exist for some peptides, resulting in the absence of detectable CD4+ responses. Second, the assays used to test peptide immunogenicity usually involve several million T cells, at most, meaning that T cell clones with a very low abundance might not be represented or their activity might not be detectable above background levels. Finally, neoantigen-specific Treg cells have been detected in patients with cancer11, and these cells could potentially suppress the activity of and thus prevent the detection of neoantigen-specific effector CD4+ T cells in the typical enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) immunogenicity assays. Therefore, factors other than MHC II-binding might dictate CD4+ T cell responses to predicted MHC II-binding peptides, including \u2014 but not limited to \u2014 deficits in the TCR repertoire or suppression of T cells.",

Therefore, both algorithms are usefully improved tools for identifying MHC II-binding neoepitopes, as long as the low rate of CD4+ T cell response is taken into account and a sufficient number of peptides to induce a response are included in any experimental vaccines. Historically, neoepitope-based vaccines have demonstrated clinical benefit as single agents, mostly in the adjuvant or prophylactic setting2. The limited efficacy of cancer vaccines in the treatment of unresectable metastatic disease has been largely attributed to tumour-mediated immunosuppression. Combinations of neoepitope vaccines with ICIs that reduce immunosuppression have, however, shown promise in the treatment of non-resected aggressive cancers in mice12; this combination strategy is currently being tested in multiple clinical trials (for example, NCT03532217, NCT03568058, NCT03639714, NCT03970382 and NCT03597282). Neoepitope vaccines could potentially also be combined with adoptive T cell therapies. Specifically, neoepitope vaccination of patients is being used to promote the expansion of neoepitope-specific T cells in order to facilitate the cloning of patient-specific neoepitope-specific TCRs, with subsequent ex vivo genetic modification of large numbers of autologous non-tumour-reactive T cells to express the neoepitope-specific TCRs before they are returned to the patient to attack the tumour (NCT03412877 and NCT03970382).",
