But spending all this time at home, without any of those \"things\" has made me realize how completely unnecessary nearly all of those \"things\" truly are. Things and stuff are no longer available. I cannot get my nails done or get a haircut or grab lunch with a friend. Yet, I am surviving. We all are surviving. In fact, without all these things and the staff and supply chain resources needed to provide them, right now, we are saving lives. We are doing our part to flatten the curve by staying home and curtailing unnecessary spending that places demands on an already sensitive supply chain. I have also learned how carefully we must protect the very young and the geriatric population plus those who are immunocompromised, during this challenging time.

The US has had the most deaths (47,684) followed by Italy (25,085) and Spain (22,157). 1, 2 Dr. Andrew Kornstein said, \"How often in our lives are we fortunate enough to identify a person or experience that becomes a prevailing current for the rest of our lives-a soulmate, a financial windfall or disaster, spiritual enlightenment, stardom, working as part of a unit (eg, in the military), or finding a calling, such as medicine?\" 3 Years from now, we are likely to reflect and realize this pandemic changed the course of our lives. That is the focus of a new Editorial in the Aesthetic Surgery Journal by Dr. Mark Jewell and co-authors who discuss practice management during a pandemic and the issues affecting plastic surgeons. 4 Thousands of plastic surgeons have been forced to close their practices and furlough their loyal staff without any promise of when they might return. We are in unprecedented times, and we're in it together. Dr. Lorne Rosenfield serves as Section Editor for 'Second Thoughts on First Thoughts' that launched recently in this journal. He wrote an Editor's Note 5 that talks about the learning curve we are experiencing right now and how it is only after the fact can we connect the seminal dots of our past and truly understand what we lived through. We are still learning, but we are also innovating, growing, improving, and hopefully heading toward the peak of COVID-19 and a completely flattened curve.",

I've found myself attending charity Zoom events and donating to causes that are directing funds to those in need right now, and it feels good to help in this small way. With millions of workers furloughed or unemployed because of the pandemic, a change how we do things is inevitable. This is a time for innovation. The Aesthetic Society recognized the need to help its members and to ensure consistent and accurate messages were being distributed. They started running a COVID-19 webinar series to help aesthetic surgeons navigate the pandemic and offer critical tools, resources, and advice. The Aesthetic Surgery Journal launched ASJ Virtual Grand Rounds on Friday, April 3, 2020-an educational webinar featuring leaders in our field presenting on topics in aesthetic surgery. And on April 21 it launched ASJ GEMS (Global Educational Meetings) focusing on learning from and teaching our international colleagues. Both series have been very well attended. Since many doctors have extra time right now, residents, fellows, and other attendees are gaining from the benefit of their wisdom and are engaging with them during the Zoom calls. We are banding together in a way I haven't seen since September 11, 2001. And as if social media does not already play a big part in our lives, we are now relegated to celebrating important events such as birthdays,anniversaries, etc. digitally. Zoom is our new reality. Even grandparents are doing it. Doctors are using Telehealth to offer virtual consults and continuity of care patient care and continue to connect, educate, and engage with them through videos on Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, and Facebook.
