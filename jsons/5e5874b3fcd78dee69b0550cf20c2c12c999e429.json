In contrary to this idea, as time goes on, we understand that this problem is not a short duration crisis. It is not logical to deprive patients of life-saving treatment like radiotherapy (RT). As we all know, delaying RT in some patients will lead to reducing the benefit of this treatment and affected patient survival, as well as, it can cause a high mortality rate for patients and also a higher financial burden on health systems after the COVID 19 era. Therefore canceling or too much delay in available treatment options does not seem to be logical. In this regard, in Iran Cancer Institute, we have reached a consensus based on the evidence available in the literature, and according to the available facilities.",

Another good examples are the hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation (8) or accelerated partial breast irradiation for eligible candidates. For prostate cancers that radiation of the whole pelvis is not intended, we can use stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), an abbreviated course, or a single 19-Gy-fraction of high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy (9, 10) . In cases in which we are desperate to use a conventional schedule, we could opt for techniques with less time-consuming fractions to minimize patients' exposure and staff work-load at all possible. For example, when there is minimal difference between 3D conformal RT and IMRT, we prefer 3D. For palliative radiation, a single 8-Gy-fraction or four 5-Gy-fractions for bone and brain metastasis, respectively, are encouraged.",
