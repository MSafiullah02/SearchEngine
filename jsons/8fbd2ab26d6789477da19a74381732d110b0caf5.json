            "text": "pandemic disease referred to as coronavirus disease . 23 Hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin combination therapy is currently tested for curing 24 Covid-19, with promising results. However, the molecular mechanism of action of this 25 combination is not established yet. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations we show 26 that both drugs act in synergy to prevent any close contact between the virus and the 27 plasma membrane of host cells. We reveal unexpected molecular similarity between 28 azithromycin and the sugar moiety of GM1, a lipid raft ganglioside acting as a host 29 attachment cofactor for respiratory viruses. Due to this mimicry, azithromycin interacts 30 with the ganglioside-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This binding site 31 shared by azithromycin and GM1 displays a conserved amino acid triad Q-134/F-135/N- 32 137 located at the tip of the spike protein. We also show that hydroxychloroquine 33 molecules can saturate virus attachment sites on gangliosides in the vicinity of the 34 primary coronavirus receptor ACE-2. Taken together, these data show that azithromycin 35 is directed against the virus, whereas hydroxychloroquine is directed against cellular 36 attachment cofactors. We conclude that both drugs act as competitive inhibitors of SARS- 37 CoV-2 attachment to the host cell membrane. This is consistent with a synergistic 38 antiviral mechanism at the plasma membrane level, where the most efficient therapeutic 39 intervention probably stands. This molecular mechanism may explain the beneficial 40 effects of hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin combination therapy in patients with Covid- 41 19. Incidentally, our data suggest that the conserved Q-134/F-135/N-137 triad could be 1. Introduction 53 The emergence of the novel pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is 54 responsible for a global pandemic disease referred to as coronavirus disease 19 (Covid- The very first step of human coronaviruses replication cycle is the attachment to the 77 plasma membrane of target cells, which is mediated by a membrane protein receptor, i.e. 78 angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) in the case of SARS-CoV-2 [11]. Moreover, 79 coronaviruses are also dependent upon sialylated membrane components such as 80 gangliosides that act as attachment cofactors within lipid raft membrane platforms [12- 81 14] . As ACE-2 is localized in lipid rafts [15] , SARS-CoV-2 infection requires specific 82 targeting to these plasma membrane microdomains, where multivalent interactions 83 between the spike protein and raft components can take place. In line with notion, lipid 84 raft disruption through cholesterol depletion resulted in a significant reduction of human 85 coronavirus SARS-CoV infection [15] . The recent identification of a potential 86 ganglioside-binding domain in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike 87 protein, and its potential role in membrane recognition [10], prompted us to study the 88 molecular relationship between this domain, gangliosides, ATM and CLQ-OH. To this 89 end, we used our molecular modeling strategy that has been successfully applied for 90 unraveling the molecular mechanisms of protein binding to raft lipid components 91 including gangliosides [16, 17] and cholesterol [18, 19] . The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trimer in the prefusion conformation was obtained from 95 pdb file # 6VSB [20] . Hydroxychloroquine (CLQ-OH) is (RS)-2-[{4-[(7-chloroquinolin-96 4-yl)amino]pentyl}(ethyl)amino]ethanol. CLQ-OH was generated by hydroxylation of 97 chloroquine (CLQ) and validated as previously described [10] . CLQ was retrieved from 98 pdb file # 4V2O (CLQ co-crystallized with saposin B) [21] . Azithromycin (ATM) is (2R,3S,4R,5R,8R,10R,11R,12S,13S,14R)-11-[(2S,3R,4S,6R)-4-100 (dimethylamino)-3-hydroxy-6-methyloxan-2-yl]oxy-2-ethyl-3,4,10-trihydroxy- [(2R,4R,5S,6S)-5-hydroxy-4-methoxy-4,6-dimethyloxan-2-yl]oxy-3,5,6,8,10,12,14-102 heptamethyl-1-oxa-6-azacyclopentadecan-15-one. The 3D structure of ATM was 103 obtained from pdb file # 5UXD (ATM co-crystallized with macrolide 2'-104 phosphotransferase) [22] . (http://molexus.io/molegro-molecular-viewer) as described previously [16] [17] [18] [19] 23] . (Table S1 ). Schematically, the binding site is formed by two discontinuous regions of the 200 protein, including the QFN triad with additional C-136, D-138, R-158 and S-161 residues 201 (Figures 4 and 5) . These seven amino acid residues accounted for almost 90% of the 202 whole energy of interaction (Table S1 and Figure 5 ).",

Among the potential solutions currently under investigation, a 57 combination bitherapy consisting of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine with 58 antibiotic azithromycin has received special attention. Following initial reports from 59 China indicating a potential effect of chloroquine (CLQ) [2], a preliminary clinical trial 60 was implemented in France on a small cohort of COVID-19 patients [3]. A significant 61 viral load reduction was observed in the 20 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine 62 (CLQ-OH) [3], a CLQ derivative with increased solubility in water and decreased 63 toxicity [4]. With the aim of preventing bacterial super-infection, six additional patients 64 of this trial also received azithromycin (ATM) for five days. All these patients had 65 undetectable viral load after 6 days [3]. Thus, although these promising data need clinical 66 confirmation with more patients, CLQ-OH/ATM combination therapy already appears 67 superior to CLQ alone as a first line-treatment for COVID-19.",

However, several reports indicate that CLQ could also 74 prevent virus attachment through a direct effect on host cell surface molecules [9,10].",

            "text": "1. Molecular mimicry between ATM and ganglioside GM1152The chemical structure of ATM is shown inFigure 1a. The molecule contains two sugar-153 like pyranyl rings, one with nitrogen-containing group (N-pyr), the other with an acetyl 154 group (Ac-pyr). The remaining part of the molecule is cyclic, so that its overall 155 conformational flexibility, although significant, is restricted to a limited spatial volume of156 2082 \u00c5 3 (Figure 1b). Interestingly, this volume is almost the same as the one of the 157 saccharide part of ganglioside GM1 (2293 \u00c5 3 , Figure 1b), a lipid raft ganglioside that 158 plays a critical role in the binding and endocytosis of respiratory viruses [26], including 159 pathogenic human coronaviruses [27]. Beyond their similar spatial volume, the 160 saccharide part of GM1 and ATM also share some analogous chemical features including 161 sugar rings and a solvent-accessible surface dotted with several CH and OH groups 162 (Figure 1b). This molecular similarity is further illustrated in Figure S1 where ATM is 163 superimposed on the saccharide part of GM1. 164 Given that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein displays a ganglioside-binding site at the tip of 165 its NTD [10], we considered the possibility that ATM, as a \"ganglioside mimic\", could 166 also bind to this site. The structural features of the SARS-CoV-2 spike in the prefusion 167 conformation [20] are shown in Figure 1c. It consists of three interdigitated spike proteins 168 that provide the virus its typical corona like shape in electron microscopy images. In each 169 subunit, the most distant part from the viral envelope is divided in two separate domains, 170 the NTD and the receptor-binding domain (RBD). The NTD has a flat surface available 171 for ganglioside binding [10], and this process is independent from the ACE-2 receptor 172 recognition which occurs at the tip of the RBD [11,20]. When seen from above, the viral 173 spike has a typical triangle shape, with a ganglioside-binding domain at each apex. Thus, 174 the spike central area is devoted to ACE-2 binding, leaving three peripheric flat surface 175 areas available for ganglioside attachment. Such dual ganglioside/receptor binding is 176 commonly used by pathogenic viruses such as HIV-1 [28-30] and bacterial neurotoxins 177[16]. By combining the high affinity for a single protein receptor with multiple low 178 affinity attachment sites, these pathogens have selected a very efficient pathway to gain 179 entry into host cells.",

Characterization of an ATM binding site at the tip of SARS-CoV-2 spike 182 protein 183 When ATM molecules were merged with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a very good fit 184 was evidenced for one particular pose at the tip of protein (Figure 2). All other docking 185 attempts on the NTD or the RBD of the spike protein were unsuccessful (Figure S2) as 186 they did not satisfy the minimum cutoff values. Not surprisingly, their trajectories started 187 destabilizing before 10 ns. In contrast, ATM #1 (colored in yellow in Figure S2) 188 remained bound to the spike protein throughout the simulation process (Figure 3). It is 189 interesting to note that a significant movement of the drug was observed from its docked 190 pose to stable MD pose (dock-to-MD transition), especially during the first 10-ns of 191 simulations (Figure S3). A stable complex association was then reached after 10 ns. We 192 noticed that three amino acid residues, referred to as the \"QFN triad\", exhibited 193 significant conformational rearrangement during the binding process: Q-134, F-135 and 194 N-137 (Figure 3). The principal moves consisted in a significant reorientation of the 195 aromatic ring of F-135, from suboptimal stacking to stabilized T-shape CH-\u03c0 interaction, 196 and a concomitant retraction of the Q-134 side chain.

These new data 209 confirmed and extended our previous results obtained with isolated gangliosides [10]. 210 Indeed, cholesterol and sphingomyelin appeared to stabilize the typical chalice-shaped 211 GM1 dimer which serves as a landing platform for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Figure 212 6). Moreover, the histograms of Figure 5 show that all amino acid residues of the spike 213 protein that are involved in ATM binding, including the QFN triad, are also essential for 214 GM1 binding in the lipid raft environment (Table S1 and Figure 5). Taken together, these 215 data suggest that the NTD of the viral glycoprotein may indeed display a common 216 ganglioside/ATM binding site, in agreement with our working hypothesis. Sequence 217 alignments revealed that this common binding site, including the QFN triad, is totally 218 conserved among clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 from various geographic origins 219 worldwide(Figure 7). It is also conserved in bat RaTG13, which further illustrates the 220 close relationship between this bat coronavirus and the SARS-CoV-2 strains that are 221 currently circulating around the world.

            "text": "Synergistic antiviral effects of ATM and CLQ-OH 227 Overall, these molecular modelling studies are consistent with the notion that ATM might 228 inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection through direct binding to virus spike and subsequent 229 neutralization of the infection process which requires spike protein recognition and 230 attachment to gangliosides. This mechanism of action is illustrated in Figure 8. By 231 comparing the models in Figure 8a and 8b, one can see that both ATM and gangliosides 232 bind to the same site of the spike protein, centered on the QFN triad. Thus, in presence of 233 ATM, the virus spike would be unable to reach gangliosides on the host plasma 234 membrane (Figure 8c). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that such a 235 mechanism of action is proposed for explaining the antiviral effect of ATM. 236 Then we looked at CLQ-OH and its interaction with GM1. We recently published a 237 model describing a complex formed by one GM1 and two CLQ-OH molecules [10]. For 238 the sake of comparison, we applied to this model the same molecular modelling 239 approaches as for ATM (i.e. in presence of surrounding raft lipids). We obtained a stable 240 complex formed by a ganglioside dimer, each monomer being associated with two CLQ-241 OH molecules (Figure 8d). The stability of this complex is reinforced by a rearrangement 242 of CLQ-OH molecules which, while interacting with the saccharide part of GM1, also 243 interact with each other. Consequently, the surface of the ganglioside is almost 244 completely masked, so that the ganglioside dimer can no longer be recognized by the 245 viral spike (Figure 8c). In presence of both ATM and CLQ-OH, virus-ganglioside 246 interactions are efficiently blocked, preventing any close contact between the virus and 247 the plasma membrane of host cells. The molecular details of this synergistic antiviral 248 effect are worth mentioning. As shown in Figures 5 and 8e and",

Molecular modelling 278 approaches allowed us to get around this difficulty by studying whole gangliosides in 279 membrane-compatible conformations[16,32,33]. The MD simulations performed in the 280 present study were done on gangliosides surrounded by cholesterol and sphingomyelin, 281 which mimic a lipid raft environment.282To date, there are several structural data of the SARS-CoV-2 protein in the prefusion 283 conformation or bound to its primary receptor ACE-2[11,20]. However, ACE-2 is in 284 lipid rafts and raft disruption induces a marked decrease of virus infection[15]. Thus, it is285 likely that the virus interacts with the raft surface through multivalent contacts involving 286 both ACE-2 and gangliosides. The fact that the RBD and the ganglioside-binding domain 287 belong to distinct parts of the trimeric spike is consistent with this notion. Such a 288 complex network of virus-host cell membrane interactions is consistent with previously 289 characterized virus infection strategies. Indeed, the HIV-1 fusion process driven by gp120 290 and gp41 envelope proteins involves a receptor (CD4), a coreceptor (chiefly CCR5) and 291 glycosphingolipid cofactors [39]. Like SARS-CoV-2, the pentameric capsid protein of 292 SV40, and polyoma viruses display three distinct binding sites for gangliosides, which 293 serve as critical receptors for these non-enveloped viruses in lipid raft domains [40]. 294 Our MD simulations suggest that both CLQ-OH and ATM may block SARS-CoV2 295 binding to gangliosides via mirror competitive mechanisms. ATM, which has some 296 molecular similarity with GM1 sugar, can thus occupy the ganglioside-binding domain of 297 the spike protein and neutralize virus binding to lipid rafts. CLQ-OH covers the . Each of these drugs might be efficient alone to block virus 300 attachment, ATM through virus binding, CLQ-OH through ganglioside binding. Since 301 both drugs interfere with the same mechanism but with distinct molecular targets, they 302 are expected to work together in synergy, as suggested by recent clinical data [3]. 303 The posology of the combination therapy for Covid-19 is 600 mg CLQ-OH and 250 mg 304 ATM per day [3,34]. This ratio corresponds to a molar ratio of five CLQ-OH for one 305 ATM. Our in silico calculations indicate a binding ratio of four CLQ-OH for one ATM, 306 which is close to the posology. Furthermore, since ATM shares structural similarity with 307 the saccharide part of GM1, one should ask whether ATM could bind to CLQ-OH and by 308 this way reduce the potential effectiveness of this combination therapy. However, since 309 ATM and CLQ-OH have been reported to synergistically decrease SARS-CoV-2 load in 310 infected patients [3], drug cross-neutralization is very unlikely. Consistently, we could 311 not evidence any stable ATM-CLQ-OH complexes by our molecular modelling 312 approaches.",
