The viral infection causes a series of respiratory illnesses, including severe respiratory syndrome, indicating that the virus most likely infects respiratory epithelial cells and spreads mainly via respiratory tract from human to human. However, viral target cells and organs have not been fully determined, impeding our understanding of the pathogenesis of the viral infection and viral transmission routes. According to a recent case report, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in a stool specimen, 1 raising the question of viral gastrointestinal infection and a fecal-oral transmission route. It has been proven that SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE Q8 ) 2 as a viral receptor for entry process. 2 ACE2 messenger RNA is highly expressed and stabilized by B0AT1 in gastrointestinal system, 3,4 providing a prerequisite for SARS-CoV-2 infection. To further investigate the clinical significance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces, we examined the viral RNA in feces from 71 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection during their hospitalizations. The viral RNA and viral nucleocapsid protein were examined in gastrointestinal tissues from 1 of the patients.",

As shown in Figure 1 , the mucous epithelium of esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and rectum showed no significant damage with H&E staining.

Because viruses spread from infected to uninfected cells, 6 viral-specific target cells or organs are determinants of viral transmission routes. Receptormediated viral entry into a host cell is the first step of viral infection. Our immunofluorescent data showed that ACE2 protein, which has been proven to be a cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal, and rectal epithelia, supporting the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells. ACE2 staining is rarely seen in esophageal mucosa, probably because the esophageal epithelium is mainly composed of squamous epithelial cells, which express less ACE2 than glandular epithelial cells.",

Recently, we and others have isolated infectious SARS-CoV-2 from stool (unpublished Q12 data), confirming the release of the infectious virions to the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, fecal-oral transmission could be an additional route for viral spread. Prevention of fecal-oral transmission should be taken into consideration to control the spread of the virus.",

He was admitted to the negative-pressure isolation room in the Department of Infectious Diseases at our hospital as a suspected case of SARS-CoV-2 infection. On admission, the physical examination showed a body temperature of 37.5 C, blood pressure of 105/56 mm Hg, pulse of 67 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute with oxygen saturation of 97%. On physical examination, auscultation indicated rhonchi and cracks on bilateral lungs. Initial arterial blood gas analysis showed the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 )/fraction of inspiration oxygen (FiO 2 ) was 176. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens tested positive by rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Chest computed tomography Q15 presented with multiple ground-glass opacities, coinciding with previous reports, 1,2 showing evidence of pneumonia in both the left and right lungs. The patient's wife and daughter tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and were admitted to the hospital on January 18, 2020.",

Empiric antimicrobials with oseltamivir and moxifloxacin was given during this period of time. On hospital day 4, the patient developed severe respiratory distress, with the PaO 2 /FiO 2 decreasing to 130 and was immediately transferred to the intensive care unit, receiving an intubation and mechanical ventilation. Along with sedation, proneposition mechanical ventilation was applied for 12 hours per day, and low tidal volume was set. The PaO 2 /FiO 2 increased to 350 immediately after intubation but decreased gradually again in the following several days to the lowest level of 70 at 10 days after admission. Meanwhile, the chest radiograph showed extensive bilateral consolidation; emergent veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was applied at the same day. On day 10, coffee ground gastric contents were observed from the gastric drainage tube and fecal occult blood tested positive, indicating upper gastrointestinal bleed. Gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed to determine the exact location of bleeding. Mucosa damage in the esophagus was observed under endoscopy. Biopsy samples were taken from esophagus, gastric, duodenum, and colon for histopathologic and immunofluorescent staining. One day after treatment with octreotide and esomeprazole, gastrointestinal bleeding stopped. As of February 12, 2020, the patient remained hospitalized. The vital signs were stable with mechanical ventilation, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and low-dose vasopressors. There is no obvious evidence of other organ dysfunction.",
