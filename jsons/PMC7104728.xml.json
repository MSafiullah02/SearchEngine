In August 2017, the disease relapsed again, being refractory to immunomodulatory agents (thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide), bortezomib, and alkylators (melphalan, cyclophosphamide), as well as the SLAMF7-targeting antibody elotuzumab at that time. Daratumumab monotherapy (16 mg/kg) was initiated as seventh line of treatment. After 2 infusions, she presented with fever. History and physical examination revealed no signs of infection. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures were negative for microorganisms. Chest x-ray showed no pulmonary infiltrates. She was treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotics, amoxicillin/clavulanate, for 1 week, and the peripherally inserted central venous catheter was removed. No pathogens were cultured on the tip.",

Repeated laboratory examinations showed no abnormalities, and there was no evidence for mycobacterial disease or respiratory viruses (influenza virus A/B, metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus [types 1-4], rhinovirus, and coronavirus). A computed tomography scan of the chest and abdomen, as part of the diagnostic workup of fever of unknown origin, revealed no explanation for her symptoms. Meanwhile, her clinical condition deteriorated with the development of night sweats, anorexia, weight loss (5 kg), and fatigue. At this time, her platelet count (131 to 53 \u00d7 109/L) and hemoglobin level (8.0 to 6.3 mmol/L) decreased in the absence of neutropenia. Upon the development of chills, 3 weeks after she first reported fever, she was admitted to the hospital. Repeated cultures of blood, urine, and sputum remained negative for microorganisms. Given the persistence of fever, her immunocompromised status, and, at this point, inconclusive workup, we analyzed the potential reactivation of viral infections. Epstein-Barr virus DNA was not present in blood samples. However, high levels of CMV-DNA were detected in blood by quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay (> 100.000 copies/mL) indicating a symptomatic CMV infection. There was no CMV end-organ disease such as pneumonitis or hepatitis. She reported abdominal discomfort and diarrhea coinciding with the onset of fever, suggesting a possible CMV-colitis. However, because she refused endoscopic evaluation, this diagnosis could not be confirmed. Importantly, serologic antibody tests in 2010 already showed positivity for CMV-specific IgG, indicating CMV reactivation and not primary infection in the current situation.1 Treatment with intravenous ganciclovir 5 mg/kg twice daily was initiated, resulting in normalization of her temperature within 24 hours. After 48 hours, the CMV-DNA load decreased to 58.000 copies/mL. She was discharged with continuation of valganciclovir orally 900 mg twice daily, and 2 months after diagnosis, the CMV-DNA load was repeatedly below the detection limit (< 500 copies/mL) and eventually became negative. Her symptoms did not recur, while at the same time, platelet counts and hemoglobin levels returned to baseline values and her diarrhea resolved.",

In prospective studies, the incidence of CMV-DNAemia without CMV-related symptoms post-ASCT ranges from 14.7% to 42.3%. Given the low rate of patients with CMV-DNAemia that develop a symptomatic CMV infection, prospective monitoring of CMV titers in these patients is not recommended.3 When CMV-DNA quantification was performed on clinical indication, the rate of symptomatic CMV infection post-ASCT ranges from 0.7% to 30.7%.3 Bortezomib-containing induction regimens are associated with a higher incidence of CMV reactivation post-ASCT.3, 6, 7\n",

There was no CMV-DNAemia in these patients. Altogether, routine screening of CMV does not seem beneficial in patients treated with daratumumab. However, the possibility of a CMV reactivation should be taken into consideration in case of unexplained fever or bone marrow suppression, such as occurred in our patient, or signs suggestive of CMV end-organ disease.",

We currently do not recommend routine screening for CMV in patients with MM during daratumumab treatment. However, CMV reactivation should always be considered in patients with MM treated with daratumumab or other novel agents with immunosuppressive effects, who develop fever or other complaints that cannot be otherwise explained.",
