These herbs have been wildly used as traditional medicines in many countries, especially in eastern Asia. Currently, a number of researchers are focusing on the pharmacological effects of this compound. Previous reviews have summarized the anticancer and antiinflammatory properties of emodin (Shrimali et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2013). In the last 3 years, there have been many reports on the anti\u2010tumour and antiinflammatory effects of emodin. Furthermore, emodin has been demonstrated to possess a wide spectrum of pharmacological effects, such as antiviral, antibacterial, anti\u2010allergic, anti\u2010osteoporotic, anti\u2010diabetic, immunosuppressive, neuroprotective and hepatoprotective activities. Moreover, the laxative property of emodin has been its primary mechanism of action for promoting weight loss (Matsuda et al., 2008).",

The antiinflammatory effect of emodin has been associated with the inhibition of the pro\u2010inflammatory transcription factor NF\u2010\u03baB. Gao et al. elucidated the antiinflammatory active components of Jiashitang scar removal ointment, including saffiomin, emodin, salvianolic acid, tanshinone and triterpenoid saponin derivatives. Among these active ingredients, emodin was predicted to exert NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010inhibiting effects through the mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase (MAPK), PI3K/AKT and NIK\u2010IKK pathways (Gao et al., 2014). In a collagen\u2010induced arthritic mouse model, emodin exhibited its anti\u2010arthritis effects through inhibition of the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway and pro\u2010inflammatory mediators (Hwang et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2013). Moreover, emodin could improve the corneal structure and reduce corneal injure by suppressing the activation of NF\u2010\u03baB, c\u2010JunN\u2010terminalkinase (JNK) and the expression of ICAM\u20101 (Kitano et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2009a, 2015a). In a severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) model group, emodin treatment significantly decreased the expression of Bip, inositol\u2010requiring\u20101\u03b1 (IRE1\u03b1), TNF receptor\u2010associated factor 2 and ASK1 and inhibited phosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAPK by inhibiting ER stress transducers IRE1\u03b1 and its downstream molecules (Wu et al., 2013).

The results suggested that emodin might be considered as a potential lead therapeutic agent in the treatment of SARS (Ho et al., 2007). Dang et al., for the first time, demonstrated that emodin had a weak but long\u2010lasting inhibitory effect on HBV replication in vivo (Dang et al., 2009). In vitro experiments showed that exposure of HepG\u20102 cells to emodin resulted in time\u2010dependent and concentration\u2010dependent inhibition of hepatitis B virus DNA replication and hepatitis B surface antigen secretion (Dang et al., 2006). Similarly, emodin reduced Coxsackievirus B4 entry and replication on HepG\u20102 cells in a concentration\u2010dependent and time\u2010dependent manner. The results implied that emodin might act as a biological synthesis inhibitor against Coxsackievirus B4 infection rather than directly inactivating the viruses or blocking their absorption to the susceptible cells (Liu et al., 2013). In a biochemical assay, emodin specifically inhibited the nuclease activity of herpes simplex virus\u20101 UL12 alkaline nuclease.

To assess the anti\u2010allergic activity of emodin, an in vivo passive anaphylaxis animal model and in vitro mouse bone marrow\u2010derived mast cells were used to investigate the mechanism of its action on mast cells. The results demonstrated that emodin attenuated the mast cell\u2010dependent passive anaphylactic reaction in IgE\u2010sensitized mice. Therefore, emodin inhibited mast cell activation and thereby the anaphylactic reaction through the suppression of the receptor\u2010proximal Syk\u2010dependent signalling pathways (Lu et al., 2011).",
