            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a coronavirus that was initially identified in 1978 (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978) and is endemic mainly in Asia. In 2010, a PEDV outbreak emerged in China and then spread to other countries in Asia and North America (Li et al., 2012; Vlasova et al., 2014). The PEDV genome consists of a single-stranded positive-sense RNA molecule. Its structural proteins include the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and the nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The S protein, which is responsible for virus attachment, receptor binding, cell membrane fusion, and entry, can induce neutralizing antibodies in the host (Lai et al., 2007). A phylogenetic analysis based on S gene alignment indicated that PEDVs can be categorized into two genotypes: genotype 1 (G1) and genotype 2 (G2). These genotypes each consist of two subgroups: G1a and G1b for G1, and G2a and G2b for G2. Isolates of G2 are usually more pathogenic than those of G1 (Lee, 2015). G1 PEDVs include classic strains such as CV777 and DR13. G2a isolates have been found in Asia. Notably, G2b isolates were responsible for the recent pandemic outbreaks in North America and Asia, which were characterized by high mortality in piglets (Huang et al., 2013; Vlasova et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016). Although inactivated and attenuated vaccines based on the classical CV777 strain have been widely used in China, porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is still not controlled effectively (Wang et al., 2016). The low-to-moderate effectiveness of the current CV777-based vaccines may be attributed to antigenic differences between the S protein of the vaccine and those of field epizootic strains (Lee, 2015). Currently, a commercial vaccine against G2b strains remains unavailable. The isolation of PEDV in cell culture has proven fastidious, and a successfully isolated virus may still be incapable of retaining its infectivity upon further in vitro passage (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988; Oka et al., 2014). This laboratory hurdle makes the production of an efficacious vaccine challenging.",

Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a promising viral vector for expressing foreign antigens, which are capable of potently stimulating host humoral and cellular immune responses (Roberts et al., 1998; Tan et al., 2005). In the present study, a highly attenuated recombinant VSV with triple amino acid mutations in the M protein (\u0394M51, V221F, and S226R) (VSVMT) was used to express the S protein of PEDV, with the aim of developing a mucosal vaccine against the predominant epidemic isolates of G2b (Fang et al., 2015). Our data indicate that, when 19 amino acids of its cytoplasmic domain were deleted, the S protein could be efficiently incorporated into VSV particles and lead to the generation of a recombinant VSV (VSVMT-S\u039419) with high efficiency. Our in vivo studies revealed that VSVMT-S\u039419 could effectively induce anti-PEDV immunity in pigs via intramuscular, but not intranasal, immunization. Notably, the administration of VSVMT-S\u039419 in sows stimulated robust passive immunity in neonatal piglets, which could resist a lethal-dose challenge by a virulent homologous PEDV strain. Thus, together with the advantages that VSVMT-S\u039419 can replicate in BHK21 cells at titers above 108 PFU/ml and that BHK21 cells can grow in suspension in disposable bioreactors at cell concentrations of higher than 1 \u00d7 107 cells/ml, our findings indicate that recombinant VSVMT could be a promising platform for rapidly developing vaccines against emerging or reemerging epidemic strains of PEDV.",

We initially constructed the rVSV plasmid with the full-length PEDV S gene; however, no replication-competent rVSV was rescued. Next, we generated rVSV plasmids encoding C-terminal-truncated versions of the SH2012 S protein (deletions of AA 19\u201326) (Fig. 2\nA and B). However, only the resulting plasmids, pVSVMT-S\u039419, which encodes the full-length PEDV S protein except for the C-terminal 19 amino acids, was found to be capable of rescuing rVSV. The resulting virus caused typical cytopathic effects in freshly prepared BHK-21  cells and was named as VSVMT-S\u039419. To further confirm the recovery of VSVMT-S\u039419, RNA was extracted from a plaque-purified rVSV clone, and an RT-PCR assay was performed to amplify the S gene, which was identified via DNA sequencing (data not shown). To confirm that the S protein was indeed expressed and incorporated into VSV particles, VSVMT-S\u039419 was purified by ultracentrifugation and then analyzed by western blotting. Using convalescent sera from a PEDV-infected pig as the primary antibody, the \u223c200 kDa PEDV S protein was detected in purified VSVMT-S\u039419 but not in VSVMT. In the positive control PEDV strain CV777, in addition to the S protein (\u223c200 kDa), the N protein (\u223c55 kDa) was also detected (Fig. 2C). Using convalescent sera from a VSV-infected mouse as the primary antibody, typical bands of VSV structural proteins L, G, N/P, as well as M were detected as previously reported (Roberts et al., 1999) in both VSVMT-S\u039419 and VSVMT but not in CV777 or mock control (Fig. 2D).

As shown in Fig. 3\n, no virus-specific antibody was detected in the control mice and pigs. However, when emulsified with Freund's adjuvants, VSVMT-S\u039419 could induce PEDV- and VSV-specific immunity via the IM route in both pigs and mice in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In the IM high-dose mouse group, the PEDV-specific VN titers peaked at 1:100 at 10 days after the second immunization, whereas the VSV-specific VN titers were 1:1200 (Fig. 3A). Notably, although PEDV-specific VN antibodies could not be induced via the IN route by either high or low-dose live VSVMT-S\u039419 in mice, VSV-specific VN antibodies could still be detected in inoculated mice, with peak titers of \u223c1:2000 in the high-dose group at 10 days post-booster vaccination (Fig. 3A). The humoral immune responses elicited by VSVMT-S\u039419 in pigs were examined by ELISA and neutralization assay.

As with mice, VSV-specific, but not PEDV-specific, antibodies could be detected in pigs immunized with VSVMT-S\u039419 via the IN route (Fig. 3B).

To formulate a clinically useable vaccine with VSVMT-S\u039419, the following three commercial adjuvants were tested: MONTANIDE\u2122 IMS 1313 VG NPR adjuvant (IMS 1313); MONTANIDE\u2122 ISA 206 VG adjuvant (ISA 206), and MONTANIDE\u2122 ISA15A VG adjuvant (ISA15A). IMS1313 is a nanoparticle adjuvant, ISA206 is a Water-Oil-Water emulsion, and ISA15A is an Oil-Water emulsion. Purified VSVMT-S\u039419 was separately mixed with each of these adjuvants. Each pig was intramuscularly inoculated twice, 10 days apart (days 0 and 10), at a dose of 107 PFU. As shown in Fig. 3C, PEDV- and VSV- specific neutralizing antibodies were effectively stimulated in pigs. After the first immunization, the PEDV-specific VN titers in the ISA15A and ISA206 groups were 1:10 and 1:40, respectively, whereas those in the IMS1313 group reached 1:80. The PEDV-specific VN titers in the ISA206 group eventually peaked at 1:200 at 30 days after the second immunization and then declined rapidly; in contrast, the PEDV-specific VN titers in the IMS1313 and ISA15A groups each reached 1:200 and maintained this level until 30 days after the second immunization. Sera IgG levels in pigs vaccinated with VSVMT-S\u039419 emulsified with IMS1313 were positive at only 10 days after the first immunization, with an S/P value that was significantly higher than those of the other adjuvants (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3C). In addition, no adverse reaction was observed at the injection sites when IMS1313 was used as the adjuvant, whereas adverse effects on the skin occurred in some pigs when using ISA206 or ISA15A as adjuvants (data not shown).

All the piglets were monitored daily until 10 days post-challenge (dpc) for clinical symptoms, fecal grade, body weight, and mortality. PEDV RNA was extracted from daily rectal swabs of piglets and assessed by RT-qPCR. As shown in Fig. 5\n, following the challenge with SH 2012, the body weights of piglets from mock-vaccination sows dropped \u223c30% at 4 dpc, to a level that is significantly lower than that of the other two groups (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5A). Severe watery diarrhea with vomiting could be observed in these animals, with clinical scores reached as high as 4. Virus shedding in their feces was confirmed by RT-qPCR, with the Ct values reaching as low as 12 at 2 dpc and remaining less than 15 at 4 dpc; these levels were also significantly lower than those in the other two groups (Fig. 5D) (p < 0.01).

Not surprisingly, no watery diarrhea was observed in the mock-challenge piglets; their average clinical scores were less than 1, and their Ct values were above 30. Challenged piglets from vaccinated sows had mild diarrhea beginning at 2 dpc, with clinical scores around 2.5. However, at 9 dpc, no watery diarrhea was observed in these animals (Fig. 5C). Additionally, reduced virus shedding was observed in piglets from vaccinated sows following oral challenge, with the mean Ct value increasing from 15 to 30 between 2 and 10 dpc (Fig. 5D).

            "text": "Presently, one of the major hurdles for PEDV vaccine development is that isolating PEDV in cell culture has proven fastidious and time-consuming, and an isolated virus may still be incapable of retaining infectivity upon further in vitro passage. Because of these issues, Gerdts et al. claimed that research on next-generation vaccines, such as subunit and viral-vectored approaches, is critical for the prevention of future outbreaks of emerging coronavirus diseases (Gerdts and Zakhartchouk, 2017). Hain et al. has developed a recombinant parapoxvirus as the vector to express S protein (Hain et al., 2016). Recombinant VSV is a promising vaccine vector for expressing foreign antigens, and has been used as the platform for construction of human vaccines, such as the well-known VSV-based Ebola virus vaccine (Regules et al., 2017). It has been shown that the cytoplasmic tail of coroanvirus spike protein can play key roles for its incorporation into VSV particles (Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2009). In our study, full-length S gene of SH2012 was initially cloned into genome of highly attenuated VSVMT, with the aim of making mucosal vaccine based on replication-competent VSV for pigs. However, no rVSVMT-SFL recovery was observed. Both PEDV and TGEV belong to Alphacoronavirus genus within the Coronaviridae family. A tyrosine-based motif (YxxI) within cytoplasmic tail of TGEV spike protein can lead to its intracellular retention and thus interfere with its incorporation into VSV particles (Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2004). Deletion of the YxxI motif results in successful recovery of recombinant VSV pseudotyped with truncated TGEV S (S\u039414) (Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2009). It is noteworthy that there is a conserved dibasic motif of KxHxx within PEDV S cytoplasmic tail (KVHVQ), which can also lead to retention of S protein to the endoplasmic reticulum\u2013Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Shirato%20K%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=21840351, Shirato et al., 2011). As shown by Hou et al., the YxxI and KxHxx motifs within PEDV S tail can synergistically regulate its expression on cell surface (Hou, et al., 2019). Consequently, as with TGEV S, the failure of full-length PEDV S incorporation into VSV particles might also be due to its intracellular retention, rather than presence at the plasma membrane, where VSV should be assembled by a budding process. Thus\uff0cto remove the YxxI and KxHxx motifs, we generated rVSVMT plasmids expressing S mutants with 19\u201326 AA of the cytoplasmic domain deleted (Fig. 2A and B). The resulting plasmid pVSVMT-S\u039419, which encodes S except for its C-terminal 19 amino acids, achieved successful rescue, whereas the other constructs (S\u039420-26) failed. The results suggested that, some structural features within the truncated S protein, such as an optimal length of the truncated cytoplasmic tail, might also be essential for its incorporation into VSV particles even though the intracellular retention signals have been removed. However, the detailed mechanism still need clarification in future study. Notably, although inserted with a large-sized foreign protein, VSVMT-S\u039419 still could replicate as efficiently as its parental virus VSVMT\nin vitro, with the maximum titer exceeding 108 PFU/ml in BHK-21 cells. Together with the advantages that BHK21 cells can grow in suspension in disposable bioreactors at cell concentrations higher than 1 \u00d7 107 cells/mL (Genzel, 2015), recombinant VSV could be an ideal platform for conveniently preparing vaccines against emerging or reemerging PEDV. At present, it is still difficult to construct recombinant PEDV using reverse genetics. However, with helps by VSV-based PEDV S protein, epitopes, especially conformational epitopes on S protein might be mapped accurately, even to the level of single amino acid. In addition, the role of S protein in loss of cross-protection between G1 and G2 genotypes isolates might also be identified with the technique.",

            "text": "Foreign antigens delivered by live VSV vector via IN route of immunization have been shown to be capable of inducing mucosal immunity against enteroviruses, like enterovirus coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), in mice (Wu et al., 2014). However, the induction of mucosal immunity in this manner has not yet been confirmed in a natural host of VSV, such as pigs. Here, we hypothesized that VSVMT-S\u039419 could also stimulate PEDV-specific gut immunity in pigs when administered via the IN route. Our observation of robust VSV-specific humoral immune responses following immunization suggest that the administered VSVMT-S\u039419 replicated in the nasal mucosa. However, to our surprise, PEDV-specific humoral responses could not be detected. The reason for the failure of VSVMT-S\u039419 to stimulate PEDV-specific antibodies when administered via the IN route still needs clarification; it is possible that the S protein was not expressed in tissue cells or not successfully presented to host antigen-presenting cells, thus failing to stimulate the production of PEDV-specific antibodies. Similar results were found in a recombinant parapox virus-based PEDV vaccine, which was reported to stimulate PEDV-specific immunity when administered via the IM route but not the transcutaneous route, which is the natural infection route of parapox virus (Hain et al., 2016). In addition, it was demonstrated that PEDV-specific immune responses could be stimulated effectively in sows immunized via the IM route with VSVMT-expressed PEDV S protein. Notably, among the adjuvants tested in our present study, the nanoparticle adjuvant IMS1313 was the most potent for formulating a VSV-based PEDV vaccine. Neutralization antibody titers, as well as serum IgG, against PEDV were positively detected as early as 10 days post-primary immunization. Furthermore, the passive transfer of antibodies from immunized sows to piglets was observed, as PEDV-specific neutralization antibodies were detected in the serum of piglets born to immunized sows following their ingestion of colostrum and milk.",
