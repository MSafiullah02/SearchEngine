The virus was first detected in Wuhan, Hubei province, China (30.5928 \u00b0N, 114.3055 \u00b0E). Wuhan is the biggest city in central China with a humid subtropical climate, an area of 8494 km2, and population of about 11 million. COVID-19 has been officially declared as a universal pandemic by WHO on 11 March 2020 as it swept into more than 114 countries and killed more than 4000 person. Within one month from the declaration date, the confirmed cases and deaths have been dramatically increased and reached more than 1 million confirmed cases and more than 100000 deaths as reported by WHO on 10 April 2020. Within less than one month, the number of confirmed cases and deaths were duplicated; more than 2 million active cases and more than 200000 deaths were reported by WHO on 1 May 2020. Numerous scientific articles from different countries are published on a daily basis (Pan, 2020; Salzberger et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020).",

The incubation period for COVID-19 is ranged between one day to two weeks. This long incubation period causes a high risk of infection from asymptomatic persons. The virus spreads through droplets from the sneeze or cough of infected persons. About 6.98 % (reported by WHO on 1 May 2020) of confirmed COVID-19 cases have died which is lower than other viral infections as shown in Fig. 1. The total number of COVID-19 cases is not exactly known as it depends on the conducted tests, so the actual total cases is higher than the reported confirmed cases. Each country established its own rules to avoid spread of COVID-19. Travel to infected countries has been prohibited by many countries. Therefore, expecting the number of infected persons and the critical cases is a crucial issue.",

Egypt has banned all flights from China to Egypt on 26 January 2020. The first confirmed case in Egypt was officially announced on 14 February 2020 for a Chinese person. The patient has been sent to a quarantine station. On 28 February 2020, the Egyptian cabinet officially denied any confirmed Egyptian cases. On 1 March 2020, the second COVID-19 case has been officially announced. The first Egyptian case died from COVID-19 was reported in 20 March 2020 after twenty days from the first died case reported in Egypt (for a German person). All schools/universities and mosques have been closed from 7 March and 21 March, respectively. To alleviate the epidemic impact, the Egyptian government has imposed different forms of lockdowns. The daily officially reported cases are shown in Fig. 2\n. Many scenarios could be occurred as COVID-19 epidemic may decline in spring or summer or may become the world's worst pandemic. Healthcare workers are at extreme risk to be infected during COVID-19 epidemic. Most of Egyptian hospitals have been prepared to face COVID-19 cases to overcome shortages of medical supplies and staff.",

The correlation between COVID-19 outbreak in Indonesia and different meteorological parameters such as relative humidity, temperature, and amount of rainfall has been explored using Spearman rank correlation method (Tosepu et al., 2020). The spatial spread of the COVID-19 outbreak in China was statistically analyzed using Moran's I correlation algorithm (Kang et al., 2020). The reported data on platelet count in COVID-19 cases has been statistically analyzed to figure out its effect on mortality rate (Lippi et al., 2020). Spatial effects of COVID-19 in China have been explored using the spatial panel models (Guliyev, 2020). In another study, a conceptual model has been developed to model COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China considering some important factors of the 1918 influenza outbreak in London, United Kingdom (Lin et al., 2020). (Al-qaness et al., 2020) presented a new forecasting model to forecast COVID-19 cases in China. The model consists of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system integrated with enhanced flower pollination algorithm and salp swarm algorithm. The proposed model was used forecast the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the upcoming ten days using the confirmed cases recorded in China.",

Monitoring the responses of a certain phenomenon as a function of time and forecasting of its future responses is a critical issue that may help the decision makers to establish future polices and plans to overcome different problems faced human beings. Both statistical and artificial intelligence based methods have been reported in literature as forecasting tools for time series problems (Lauret et al., 2017; Nury et al., 2017; Tealab et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2018). To analyze this kind of data and to forecast further responses as a function of time, statistical-based methods such as ARIMA are usually employed. Artificial intelligence-based methods have been also reported to analyze this kind of data with better forecasting capabilities compared with statistical based methods. These artificial intelligence methods have been widely used for predicting the responses of different engineering systems (Babikir et al., 2019; Elaziz et al., 2019; Elsheikh et al., 2020; Oliva et al., 2019; Shehabeldeen et al., 2020; Shehabeldeen et al., 2019).
