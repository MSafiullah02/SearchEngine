Most of the patients in the module hospital are elderly people (over 50 years old), and some of them had chronic primary diseases. Therefore, the combined use of the Chinese and Western medicine, use of multiple Chinese patent drugs, or combined use of Chinese patent drugs and Chinese herbal decoctions are common. Most of the doctors participating in the diagnosis and treatment in the module hospital were Western medicine doctors; hence,it may be necessary for the pharmacists of the clinical pharmaceutical care group to actively participate in evaluating drug compatibility, interactions, and adverse reactions to ensure the safety of the patients. Taking Jianghan module hospital as an example, possible problems of drug compatibility are summarized in Appendix 1. The module pharmacy was placed in a clean area. After the doctor processed the order on the computer, the order information was immediately transmitted to the pharmacy. Pharmacists examined electronic prescriptions and checked with doctors when a prescription was called into question. About 20,000 electronic orders of the doctors were reviewed online by clinical pharmacists, which reduced the irrational drug use and minimized the risk involved. After reviewing the prescriptions, the qualified drugs were dispensed, packaged, and handed over to the patients by the pharmacists in the designated areas. To reduce and avoid the severe adverse drug reactions or events (ADR/ADE), the clinical pharmacists informed and educated the patients about reasonable and safe medication. When ADR/ADE was observed in the patients, the doctors or nurses consulted with the clinical pharmacists and filled in the adverse drug reaction report on the ADR/ADE online reporting platform within time. Make full use of the information technology and new media to provide patients with medication consultation and personalized pharmaceutical care in a timely manner Considering the particularity of the COVID-19 infection, making full use of the information technology to provide pharmaceutical care can not only reduced direct contact with the patients and avoided unnecessary cross infections, but also saved resources such as protective clothing, so that limited resources can be used in places of great need.The emerging media platform WeChat has the following characteristics: group/private chat, text/voice message, remote online video call/voice call, and other functions, which can meet the needs of different patients and facilitate pharmacists to remotely view patients' conditions, medication status, and possible adverse reactions. We set up the WeChat group of medication consultation and paste the QR code in each ward of the module with the help of the nurses to facilitate the patients to join the group by scanning the QR code and provided medication consultation for patients. There was one QR code and one WeChat group for every 150 beds. Patients were free to join or quit the WeChat group. More than 20 clinical pharmacists joined all the WeChat groups, and were quickly divided into groups according to their specialties, provided medication consultation anytime and anywhere, answered patients' different kinds of questions, and appeased patients' anxiety.Figure 3shows pharmacists in the module hospital using WeChat to provide medication consultation to the patients. Amongthem, Figure 3-1 shows the WeChat QR code pasted to the module ward, and Figures 3-2 and 3-3 show that the pharmacists provided personalized one-on-one medication consultation services for the patients.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": "Providing medication consultation for patients using WeChat)Establish a module radio station to broadcast the knowledge about rational drug use Since most patients were elderly people, who tend to use smartphones and new technologies less frequently, the knowledge about rational drug use was distributed in a timely manner by a community module radio station to relieve the patients' panic and tension about the COVID-19 disease. Pharmacists of the clinical pharmaceutical care group oversaw the module radio station, which informed all the patients in the module about the medication, rational nutrition and diet suggestions for the new coronavirus pneumonia, and self-protection and medication guidance after discharge.The series \"rational medication to fight against the epidemic\" of Jianghan module radio station's information emission covered the following subjects: (1) Education about the antiviral drugs, antibacterial drugs, Chinese patent drugs, and symptomatic treatment drugs (antipyretic, antitussive, etc.) at the module hospital; (2) Nutrition and diet for the prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus pneumonia and living habit suggestions; (3) Self-management and medication guidance after discharge.
