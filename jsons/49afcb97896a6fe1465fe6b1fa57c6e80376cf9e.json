A new model is proposed using 2-D cellular automata (CA), which extends the traditional definition of CA and establishes whole transition rules for malware propagation in WSN. Meanwhile, the validations of the model are proved through theoretical analysis and simulations. The theoretical analysis yields closed-form expressions which show good agreement with the simulation results of the proposed model. It is shown that the malware propagation in WSN unfolds neighborhood saturation, which dominates the effects of increasing infectivity and limits the spread of the malware. MAC mechanism of wireless sensor networks greatly slows down the speed of malware propagation and reduces the risk of large-scale malware prevalence in these networks. The proposed model can describe accurately the dynamic behavior of malware propagation over WSN, which can be applied in developing robust and efficient defense system on WSN.",

Khayam and Radha [10] apply signal processing technique to model space-time propagation dynamics of topologically-aware worms in a sensor network with uniformly distributed nodes. They integrate physical, data link, network and transport protocol characteristics into the proposed model of worm propagation and obtain a closed-form expression of the infected population. De et al. [11] model and analyze the node compromise spreading process and identify key factors determining potential outbreaks of such propagations. In particular, they perform their study on random graphs precisely constructed according to the parameters of the network. However, the random graph model is homogeneous, which conflicts with the characteristic that sensor nodes relate closely to the location in WSN. Therefore, the spreading models based on random graph model are not suitable for investigating the propagation over WSN. Afterwards, the authors of Ref. [11] , in their another paper [12] , point out that the analytical model of [11] , based on random graphs, fails to capture the temporal dynamics of the comprise propagation and only succeeds in capturing the outcome of the infection. Furthermore, the authors propose an epidemic theoretic model for evaluating broadcast protocols in wireless sensor networks. However, the model assumes that the number of neighbors that can be infected by any infected node is proportional to all susceptible nodes in the network (see in Eq. (2) and (3) of [12] ). The assumption results in an inaccurate evaluation on spreading speed in the process of malware propagation.",

Since the transmission power of a wireless radio is attenuated in a squared or even higher order with the distance, multi-hop routing will consume less energy than direct communication. The attackers take advantage of the broadcast mechanism to propagate malicious codes such that malware spreads quickly to the entire network [21] . We assume that infected nodes adopt multi-hop broadcasting strategy to spread malware to their neighbors. Furthermore, the adopted broadcast protocol ensures that each infected node broadcasts the malware to its neighbors only once for the purpose of preventing broadcast storm.",

We pay more attention to 4 factors impacting on the malware propagation, which include MAC mechanism, node's relative density \u03c1 , infected rate \u03b2 and the From Fig. 8 , we can see that, the time evolution of the proposed CA model agrees perfectly with the theoretical analysis. The malwares show an exponentially increasing transmission from the initial time until reaching approximately 80% infected population, then show a slow transmission until the malwares spread to the whole network. Also we can find that, the MAC mechanism results in a competition between adjacent sensor nodes to access to the shared wireless channel, so MAC mechanism greatly slows down the speed of malware propagation and reduces the risk of large-scale malware prevalence in these networks.",

A reasonable explanation is that, ODE model assumes that the number of infected neighbors is in proportion to the fraction of all susceptible nodes in the network, which results in an inaccurate evaluation on spreading speed in the process of malware propagation. In fact, the malware propagation in WSN has the chacteristic of local spatial interaction. And the presence of neighborhood saturation dominates the effects of increasing infectivity and limits the spread of the malware. Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 show the wireless sensor network evolving patterns in the 2-D cellular space under different time t. The key difference between Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 is that the former neglects the impact of MAC mechanism, whereas the latter is more concerned to the impact of MAC mechanism. From the evolution snapshots ( Fig. 10 (a)-(d) and Fig. 11(a)-(d) ), one can see that the epidemic diffuses continuously from infected source toward outside and the propagation goes along a circular front which is spatially bounded. Specially, in our model, the adopted broadcast protocol ensures that each infected node broadcasts the malware to its neighbors only once for the purpose of preventing broadcast storm. So, those infected nodes that have transmitted packets of malware can not send malware propagation any more. In fact, an infected node inside of the circular has also no chance to infect other susceptible nodes that lie outside of the circular for the reason that interactions among nodes are distance-dependent.",
