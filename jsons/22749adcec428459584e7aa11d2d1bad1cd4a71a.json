Such asymptomatic cases complicate the tracking of the epidemic, and prevent reliable estimates of transmission, tracing, and tracking strategies for containing an epidemic by isolating and quarantining. This has been a significant concern for the current COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple reports have quoted the reproduction number to be 3; this is the number of cases estimated to be infected by an index case in a susceptible population. 1 Some modelling experts doubt this low R0 could explain the global exponential spread we have observed. Using data from 13 countries they have estimated the number could be as high as 15.4 (range 5. 5-25.4) if asymptomatic carriers were incorporated in the equation. 2 The possibility of asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 cases was first raised by a case report in China where a traveler from Wuhan was presumed to have transmitted the infection to 5 other family members in other locations while she remained asymptomatic for the entire 21-day follow-up period. 3 Subsequently a number of other reports confirmed not only the possibility but began quantifying the potential proportions. For example, the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship 4 demonstrated a significant proportion of asymptomatic cases once widespread testing of those on board the ship had been undertaken. A recent review by the Centre for Evidence Based medicine in Oxford 5 found a range of estimates of asymptomatic COVID19 cases which ranged from 5% to 80%. However, many of the identified studies were either poorly executed or poorly documented, making the validity of these estimates questionable.",

First, our search focused on published and pre-print articles, and may have missed some public health reports that are either unpublished or only available on organisational websites. Second, the design and reporting of most of the studies had a number of important deficits that could impact their inclusion or our estimates. These deficits include the poor reporting of the sample frame, the testing and symptom check, and the follow-up processes. Such reporting would have been considerably aided by a flow chart of cases (as Lavezzo et al does) of identification, testing, and follow-up including missing data. A further important limitation was the poor reporting of symptoms, which was often simply dichotomised into symptomatic versus asymptomatic without clear definitions and details of possible mild symptoms. The included studies did not report sufficient data to examine the impact of age and underlying comorbidities on the asymptomatic rate. Finally, all included studies relied on RT-qPCR, hence some cases might have been missed due to false negative result. 19 If the tests missed more asymptomatic cases, then the true prevalence of asymptomatics could be higher than our estimates.",

In four of the studies the asymptomatic cases were not retested for RT-qPCR status, and none tested for IgG and IgM antibodies. A recent USA seroprevalence study 20 reported that based on antibody testing, the infection was potentially more widespread than the inference from the number of confirmed cases. With the majority of symptomatic cases developing detectable IgM and IgG antibodies between day 12 and 14 after disease onset respectively, 21 follow-up of asymptomatic cases may need to be extended to prevent incorrectly labelling a person as a case or infectious. The estimated sensitivity and specificity of IgG and IgM tests and PCR tests may only apply to study populations that exclude asymptomatic cases. Without repeated PCR tests and follow-up with antibody tests our infection prevention strategies for asymptomatic cases remain uncertain.",
