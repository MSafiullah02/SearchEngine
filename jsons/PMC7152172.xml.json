            "text": "GI hemorrhage in dogs and cats can be the result of a primary insult to the GI tract or may be secondary to a systemic disease process. It may originate in the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine. As such, a number of pathologic processes have been associated with GI hemorrhage. In general, these can be divided into three broad categories: diseases causing ulcers, diseases causing coagulopathies, and diseases associated with vascular anomalies. Some diseases are difficult to classify into one of the above categories, and animals may have single or multiple predisposing causes.1, 4 Diseases associated with GI ulceration and/or GI hemorrhage in dogs and cats are listed in Box 119-1\n.Box 119-1Diseases Associated with Gastrointestinal Ulceration and Hemorrhage in Dogs and CatsDrug Administration\nNSAIDsGlucocorticoids\nSystemic and Metabolic Diseases\nHepatic diseaseUremiaPancreatitisHypoadrenocorticism\nIschemic Events\nGDVMesenteric volvulusMesenteric thrombosisIntussusception\nNeurologic Disease\nHead traumaIVDDMucosal traumaForeign bodies\nFungal Infections\nPythium\nHistoplasma\n\nBacterial Infections\n\nSalmonella\n\nClostridium spp.\nCampylobacter\nHelicobacter (controversial)\nParasitic Infections\nHookwormsWhipwormsCoccidiaRoundworms\nViral Infections\nParvovirusCoronavirus\nAlgal Infections\nProtothecosis\nSystemic neoplasia\nMastocytosisGastrinoma\nGastrointestinal Neoplasia\nLymphomaAdenocarcinomaLeiomyomaLeiomyosarcomaHemangioma\nStress of Critical Illness\nMajor surgeryHypovolemiaSepsis\nMiscellaneous\nIBDPolypsIdiopathic eosinophilic massesHGE\n\nGDV, Gastric dilatation-volvulus; GI, gastrointestinal; HGE, hemorrhagic gastroenteritis; IBD, inflammatory bowel disease; IVDD, intervertebral disk disease; NSAIDs, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.",

There are no veterinary studies to conclude which gastroprotectants or combination of gastroprotectants is most efficacious in the management of GI ulcers. However, a study demonstrated that famotidine (0.5 mg/kg IV q12h), omeprazole (1 mg/kg PO q24h), and pantoprazole (1 mg/kg IV q24h) significantly suppressed gastric acid secretion in dogs, but ranitidine (2 mg/kg IV q24h) failed to show significant gastric acid suppression at the dosage evaluated.26 In cases of NSAID toxicity, misoprostol may provide additional benefit (see Chapters 76 and 161).",

In cases in which GI mucosal barrier compromise is not believed to be a factor (i.e., idiopathic immune mediated thrombocytopenia) and there is no evidence of sepsis, supportive therapy and addressing the underlying cause supersedes the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
