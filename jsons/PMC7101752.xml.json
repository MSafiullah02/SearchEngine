The differences in incidence and severity of CLD between premature and term newborns with ARF and similar underlying pathophysiology suggest that there may be maturational differences in the susceptibility to lung injury(2). Postnatal adaptation in both term and preterm infants is associated with changes in gene expression. In premature subjects, Minoo et al.(3) have shown that most genes are activated in a\u201ctermlike\u201d manner, whereas others, such as the SP-A gene, appear to respond aberrantly. Thus there appears to be a molecular basis for the unique vulnerabilities of the premature infant.",

            "text": "Lung inflammation is presumed to have a role both in the pathogenesis of HMD and its evolution to CLD(4\u20136). Inflammatory cell infiltrates and expression of proinflammatory cytokines have been described in lungs of premature infants with HMD. For example, IL-1\u03b2 has been detected in BAL from infants with HMD from d 1 through 2 wk of life(7). Levels of IL-1\u03b2 in that study correlated with the number of inflammatory cells in BAL and the days of oxygen/ventilator therapy(7). A recent article described elevated levels of C5a, leukotriene B4, and IL-8 in lavage fluid from infants with HMD(8). The authors concluded that preterm infants at risk for development of CLD have an enhanced pulmonary inflammatory reaction(8). Likewise, elevated levels of IL-6 in lungs of infants with HMD have been suggested to be predictive of CLD(9). Additional support for the hypothesis that inflammation contributes to the risk of CLD comes from the success of dexamethasone therapy in improving pulmonary function, decreasing ventilatory requirements, and shortening the period of intubation(10). Dexamethasone has also been shown to decrease TNF-\u03b1 levels in lavage fluid from infants with HMD(11), and may improve survival with a decrease in the incidence of CLD(12). Thus, there are convincing data that inflammation contributes to lung injury in premature and term infants.",

TNF-\u03b1(13\u201317), IL-1\u03b2(18\u201322), and IL-8(23\u201326) are proinflammatory cytokines important in the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells. In particular, IL-8 is a potent neutrophil chemotactic factor which causes increased expression of neutrophil \u03b22 integrin adhesion molecules. IL-10, in contrast, is an antiinflammatory cytokine that in part acts to decrease the expression and function of these proinflammatory cytokine signals(27). IL-10 has been shown to inhibit production of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor by macrophages and monocytes(27, 28). IL-10 also increases synthesis of the IL-1 receptor antagonist and inhibits macrophage killing via suppression of toxic metabolite synthesis(29). In addition, IL-10 has immunoregulatory functions, inhibiting macrophage stimulated lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine synthesis (IL-2, IFN-\u03b3)(30, 31).",

This report describes the decreased production of IL-10 in the lungs of preterm newborns with diffuse alveolar damage and lung inflammation as compared to term newborns with similar illness.

These results suggest that preterm newborns with lung inflammation may be unable to activate expression of IL-10 compared with term newborns with a similar profile of lung inflammation.

We did not observe lymphocytes on the BAL cell cytopreps for the preterm and term newborns in this study.

In addition, a limited screening was performed on the BAL cell suspensions from three term and three preterm newborns included in this study. By flow cytometric analysis, the BAL cell populations were negative for the lymphocyte markers CD3, CD4, and CD45 (data not shown).

The processes of cell adhesion,trans-endothelial migration and chemotaxis must all occur to explain an influx of inflammatory cells(19). The expression of proinflammatory mediators, including cytokines is also an integral component(14\u201316, 19\u201322, 26). Our results suggest that these mechanisms are largely intact, including the inflammatory cell surface expression of \u03b22 integrin adhesion molecules (data not shown), a crucial component for cell entry into a site of tissue inflammation(19, 21, 22).

Consistent with the absence of IL-10 transcripts in their BAL-derived cells, the preterm newborns did not have appreciable IL-10 protein levels in their lavage fluid. While 13 of the 16 BAL cell samples from five term newborns contained detectable IL-10 transcripts, only three of these five term newborns had elevated levels of IL-10 in their initial lavage fluid. In addition, only one of the term patients continued expressing elevated IL-10 levels out to 72 h. The most likely explanation for these findings is that different mechanisms may regulate IL-10 expression at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels.

It is also possible that cytokines such as IL-10 can act on an intercellular basis in the absence of detectable protein in the surrounding fluids. The absence of IL-10 mRNA in the preterm BAL-derived cell suspensions suggest that IL-10 transcription may not be taking place. Another possibility is rapid nuclear metabolism of IL-10 transcripts in immature lung inflammatory cells. Alternatively, the appropriate signals that trigger IL-10 expression may not be present in preterm newborns with HMD compared with term newborns with MAS. The mechanisms which control IL-10 expression under conditions of inflammation are not clearly understood; however, the cellular and proinflammatory cytokine profiles were similar in our BAL samples from both the preterm and term newborns.

Because the absence of IL-10 may signal a partial inability to control inflammation, these findings may help explain a predisposition for CLD in preterm newborns with HMD. The persistence of neutrophils and elevated IL-8 levels in the BAL samples from these preterm newborns, and the absence in these same samples of IL-10, establishes an environment that is theoretically conducive to chronic lung inflammation. Because we found IL-10 protein in some but not all of the BAL supernatants from term infants in this study, this may explain in part the variable incidence of CLD in term infants with ARF. Persistent inflammation associated with characteristic patterns of cytokine expression in the lung may contribute to the pathophysiology of neonatal CLD, as it does to other chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma(42) and fibrotic lung diseases(43\u201348).",

Cells obtained from the lungs of preterm and term newborns may provide an opportunity to study how development can influence the expression of IL-10. Further insight into these processes may provide new therapeutic options aimed toward controlling lung inflammation in immature hosts.",

The total numbers of cells are higher in the BAL samples from the term newborns at the initial (p = 0.085) and 24-h sample times (p = 0.013). These differences are largely due to the numbers of red blood cells (RBC) found in the BAL from the term newborns, although neutrophil numbers are also higher in the term BAL samples initially (see Fig. 3). These same samples from the term patient group show an increase in the percentages of both neutrophils and macrophages as RBC decrease. In the BAL samples from preterm newborns the percentage of neutrophils remains stable over the 96-h sample period, whereas their BAL cell population becomes enriched with macrophages. The percentage of RBC (p = 0.07) and macrophages(p = 0.03) is higher in the term samples at the initial sample time. There are no other significant differences in the percentages of each cell type at any sample time. Data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD.",

IL-8 and IL-1\u03b2 were initially higher in the term BAL samples and then began to decline by 48 to 96 h, respectively. In contrast to the term BAL samples, levels of IL-8 remained constant in the preterm BAL samples. At the same time, IL-10 levels were undetectable in the BAL supernatants obtained from preterm newborns. Although IL-10 protein levels were low in the majority of samples from both patient groups, elevated IL-10 levels were found in a select few of the BAL supernatants from term newborns at the first three sampling points. There was no significant difference in BAL cytokine protein levels between the term and preterm groups even at the initial and 24-h sample times due to the number of patients studied. It is noteworthy that TNF-\u03b1 levels were increasing in the term BAL samples at 48-96 h, whereas IL-8 and IL-1\u03b2 were declining. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD.",
