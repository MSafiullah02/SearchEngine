Despite these continuous advancements for COVID-19 screening, many concerns remain about model reliability when used in a clinical setting. Much has been published, but with limited transparency in expected model performance. We set out to address this limitation through a set of experiments to quantify baseline performance metrics and variability for COVID-19 detection in chest x-ray for 12 common deep learning architectures. Specifically, we adopted an experimental paradigm controlling for train-validation-test split and model architecture where the source of prediction variability originates from model weight initialization, random data augmentation transformations, and batch shuffling. Each model architecture was trained 5 separate times on identical train-validation-test splits of a publicly available x-ray image dataset provided by . Results indicate that even within model architectures, model behavior varies in a meaningful way between trained models. Best performing models achieve a false negative rate of 3 out of 20 for detecting COVID-19 in a hold-out set. While these results show promise in using AI for COVID-19 screening, they further support the urgent need for diverse medical imaging datasets for model training in a way that yields consistent prediction outcomes. It is our hope that these modeling results accelerate work in building a more robust dataset and a viable screening tool for COVID-19.",

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is an assay commonly used to test for COVID-19, but is available in extremely limited capacity [2] , [3] . In an effort to offer a minimally invasive, low-cost COVID-19 screen via x-ray imaging, AI engineers and data scientists have begun to collect datasets [4] and utilize computer vision and deep learning algorithms [5] . All these efforts seek to leverage an available medical imaging modality for both diagnosis and, in the future, predicting case outcome. Clinical observations have largely propelled AI research in computer vision for screening COVID-19, and these reports cite differentiable lung abnormalities of COVID-19 patients from chest CT [6] ,",

P-values of the McNemars chi-squared test statistic were used to estimate the prediction behavior consistency (in the test set only) between all models for the binary classification task of detecting COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19. With the null hypothesis, a low p-value suggests that the two models in question have inconsistent prediction behaviors. A large portion of model comparisons show low p-values and therefore high prediction inconsistency ( Figure 5B ). Similarly, low p-values were common when comparing models having identical architectures ( Figure 5C ). If prediction behavior were largely consistent between models, distributions shown in Figures 5B and C would have large spikes near 1.0, instead the distribution of p-values is more uniform than expected. Given that our experimental design controlled for the TVTS and model architecture across all experiments, it is expected that a high quality dataset would produce a distribution of p-values indicating similar behavior between models with identical architectures (Figure 5C ). McNamers test suggests that several architectures have reliably inconsistent behavior. The most apparent differences are between Mobilenet-v2 v. Wideresnet-101, Resnet-152 v. Wideresnet-101, and Resnet-152 v. Wideresent-50 ( Figure 5A ). Mobilenet-v2 was found to have the least inter-and intra-model differences, which could be explained by its relatively small number of tunable parameters making a more \"general\" model fit. Predictions from Densenet-121 models had the most consistency, on average, with all other trained models including those with identical architecture. Models sharing the Wideresnet-101 architecture had the most intra-model differences followed by ResneXt-101. Comparisons between Mobilenet-v2, densenet-121, and Resnet-18 indicate that these architectures had the most similar prediction behavior ( Figure 5B ), and their false negative rate (FNR) values fall in the middle of the pack. Conversely, models with deeper architectures were responsible for the highest FNR values (Table III) . Using the ensemble of models trained during this study, the FPR and FNR become 0.009 and 0.20, respectively. The ensemble predictions were carried out by simply summing the output from the last layer (softmax) of each network for a given image in the test hold-out set. The model ensemble offers no improvement over best performing models in FNR or FPR but improves the F1 score and multiclass accuracy to 0.640 (from 0.625) and 0.894 (from 0.884), respectively.",

[29] , which contained images from 1296 COVID-19 patients allowing for a larger hold-out test size than what is currently available in x-ray (127 images at the time of this study) [29] . While CT scans provide enhanced screens, they are less accessible, more expensive, and less efficient than the chest x-ray due to the preparation time and scan time required. Consequently, CT falls short as a COVID-19 screening tool due to limitations including the complex mechanics and calibrations required for 3D geometrical renderings. Furthermore, only 25 CT scanners exist in the United States per million population (approx.) [31] , and COVID-19 screens place an increased demand on top of existing demand for CT scans. Not only that, but an increased infection risk is an unfortunate corollary for non-COVID-19 patients requiring CT scans [3] , especially due to the amount of CT essential equipment that interfaces with the patient compared to that for chest x-ray: not to mention the increased exposure for clinicians and technicians. If COVID-19 screens are needed en masse, the chest x-ray is a promising, low-cost service that requires no moving parts and could be modified to meet a spike in demand.",

The results of this study, though limited to specific neural network architectures, suggest that transfer learning provides an efficient means to achieve high accuracy in detecting COVID-19. However, models remain highly dependent upon model architecture and vary depending on initial conditions and data augmentation steps. To better quantify the reliability of AI predictions in this context, our next goal is to implement segmentation techniques [36] and carry out a cross-validation protocol for each architecture and use a richer dataset. Model accuracy metrics indicate that more advancements are necessary before using AI for COVID-19 screening via x-ray. In our opinion, clinicians should not rely on solutions derived from architectures that have high (and high variability) FNR. Furthermore, inconsistent behavior in predictions between models with identical architectures injects doubt into its efficacy, which is unlikely to resolve until dataset limitations are worked out. Without a more abundant dataset, we do not expect deep learning approaches for COVID-19 screening to gain the reliability needed for clinical implementation.",

We expect these model weights to provide significant improvements in model training efficiency as these public datasets continue to grow and evolve.
