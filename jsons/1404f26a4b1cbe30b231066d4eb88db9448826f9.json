At this point WHO called on governments to change the course of the outbreak by taking urgent and aggressive action. By the end of April, the number of cases was in excess of 3 million with 211,350 deaths worldwide. Covid-19 is related to previous pandemics -SARS-CoV-1 (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) 2 and it can be asymptomatic or result in mild to severe symptoms. Unlike influenza it can be contagious before symptoms are apparent 3 . Due to the highly contagious nature of the disease, rapid and reliable diagnosis is critical. Medical imaging has valuable roles in the diagnosis and management of the Covid-19 patient and radiographers have already started to share their experiences with imaging it 4 5 6 7 8 . Chest computed tomography (CT) has diagnostic value 9 , though presents challenges including CT availability, the complexity of imaging patients who may be on ventilators and the time taken to decontaminate the CT scanner and room after a Covid-19 patient has used it. For these reasons mobile chest radiography (CXR) has become the most commonly utilised imaging modality for the radiological follow up of lung abnormalities 10 .",

Three factors informed the rationale for creating this information source. First, not all countries were able to provide detailed information to their radiography workforce about protection against contracting Covid-19. Second, with an emphasis on mobile CXR, there was limited information available within the public domain to reskill and/or upskill the workforce which was being redeployed to undertake these examinations. Third, there was potential for a massive amount of replication to occur at hospital, regional and national levels to address this information deficiency; it was estimated that tens of thousands of radiographer hours would be directed away from caring for patients and instead invested in creating training opportunities for staff about Covid-19 and CXR.",

National input also came from colleagues across the world, this included the Italian Federazione della Associazioni Scientifiche Radiologia (FASTeR), who had a good deal of relevant experience to share. Several content teams were established around topics and they read widely and drew on personal experiences to create website materials. Teams tended to be multinational and given the restricted development timeframe, time zones created a few communications problems; also, team members often didn't know one another and that too created a few challenges. Content teams contained a broad range of subject experts, including a virologist, academic / clinical radiographers with varying areas of expertise, medical practitioner, eLearning design specialists and microbiologists. We only wanted people to work on this project who were authorities on their subjects, this was because time was severely limited and the luxury of allowing contributors a chance to start learning new fields from scratch was lacking. Web programmers uploaded and organised web content, then added functionality; a graphics artist drew or redrew images as needed; and new videos were created with a professional camera man taking and then editing video shoots.",

Web platforms that were used to house the contents included ISRRT eLearning platform (https://www.elearning.isrrt.org/) and e-LfH platform. Four e-LfH sessions have been developed using the web content from the collaboration's work, this includes ensuring safe practice for radiographers, their families, colleagues and the wider community and secondly to provide detail of how to produce and evaluate diagnostic quality chest radiographs. The sessions are: 'Minimising Risk during Mobile Radiography' 11 ; 'Mobile Chest Radiography' 12 ; 'Image Evaluation for the Diagnostic Quality of Chest Radiographs including Covid-19 cases' 13 ; 'Radiographic Practice' 14 . Links, using URLs, exist between the platforms. ISRRT / EFRS platforms will be used for webinars in due course. ISRRT eLearning platform and e-LfH eLearning resources went live on 22 nd April 2020, 18 days after the concept was proposed.",
