The current pandemic COVID-19 causes suspicious cases flocking into hospitals. The detection of COVID-19 by traditional reverse-transcription diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests is time-consuming and depends on the reliability of laboratory techniques. Several PCR-based rapid tests have been recently approved and only require less than 30 min. Chest computed tomography (CT) has been suggested as an alternative and reliable tool for the detection of COVID-19 in symptomatic patients in China [2]. However, the American College of Radiology recommended against the use of CT as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19 on March 11, 2020 [3]. To validate this recommendation, we performed a systematic review with meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic value of chest CT in COVID-19.",

Two investigators independently extracted data for pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratio [LR(+) and LR(\u2212)] with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated by midas command in Stata 15 (StataCorp LLC., College Station, TX, USA).

We further used Fagan\u2019s Nomogram to calculate the post-test probability of diagnosed COVID-19 by chest CT (Fig. 2). Our analysis revealed that, regardless the levels of pre-test probabilities (25, 50, and 75%), the post-test probabilities were only slightly changed.\n",

Our results from Fagan\u2019s Nomogram analyses suggested very little diagnostic value of using chest CT as the primary tool for COVID-19. One shortcoming of using chest CT is that patients are exposed to unnecessary radiation. The other shortcoming is that CT-scanning may increase the risk of nosocomial infection due to potential contamination of the environment.",
