            "text": "Healthcare workers caring for patients with possible or confirmed COVID-19 have to be protected against contamination. In Europe, in normal circumstances, the `respiratory protective devices' (in short, respirators) used by these healthcare workers have to comply with the standard EN149+A1:2009 [1] . Most respirators used in hospitals are single-use. As a result of theCOVID-19 outbreak, an exceptionally large demand for these respirators has arisen and shortages has occurred. Authorities have published recommendations to overcome shortages of these respirators [2, 3] . In Europe, national authorities have indicated that during the COVID-19 crisis the restriction of solely using CE certified respirators no longer applies [4] . As a consequence, the European market is flooded with respirators of unknown or uncertain quality [5] . Nevertheless, it is imperative that the safety of the healthcare workers is ensured. Therefore, the Catharina hospital developed a protocol that would allow local (in-hospital) verification of the quality of these respirators before clearance for use by staff. The protocol was developed through an interdisciplinary project team comprising a pharmacist, bio-medical engineer, infection preventionist, project manager and a physicist. The protocol includes verification of the documentation accompanying the respirator, a visual inspection of the respirator and finally the testing of full filter efficiency of the respirator. The filter efficiency is compared with the values of a premium CE-marked respirator that complies with EN149+A1:2009 [1] .",

These percentages indicate the maximum number of particles that may `leak' through the respirator during testing. The test should reflect the practical use of the respirator. The Dutch `National Institute for Public Health and the Environment' (RIVM) recommends the use of the FFP2 type when nursing and treating COVID-19 infected patients, during aerosol generating procedures [6] . Apart from the FFP2 respirator there are two other types of certified respirators on the worldwide market that have comparable properties. These are the `N95'-and `KN'95'-qualified respirators. Both types of respirators have been introduced in Dutch hospitals due to the shortage of FFP2 respirators.",

The test-rig is laid out to facilitate testing of the full or complete filter of the respirator (figure 2b), with a channel diameter of 0.16 m. The total length of the test channel is approximately 2.30 m, with 1.30m between the respirator and the open end of the channel, a Perspex mould to house the respirator, and a `clean' area of approximately 1m between the respirator and the closed end of the channel. For each respirator brand and type, a dedicated mould is constructed (e.g., Figure  2c ). The moulds were constructed by the technical department of the hospital. Figure 2d displays the particle counters (type 3016, Lighthouse worldwide solutions, Fremont, CA, USA). One particle counter measures the `dirty' area before the filter, the other measures the clean area after the filter, (figure 1). The unexpected and immediate situation of shortage of masks forced the hospital and project team to build a test rig with equipment that was available at short notice. To ensure that the measurements were valid, a premium and CE certified mask was used as reference. The results of the measurements with this mask demonstrated that the method of measuring was compliant with the EN149+A1: With the low flow velocity and a stabilisation time of one minute before particle measurements are started, the flow in the channel is assumed to be a laminar flow. The velocity of the air flow, measured in the axial centre are in the order 0.5 m/s depending on the load in the channel. The average velocity can then be calculated with \u0305 = [10] , and is in the order of 0.25 m/s. This is in the orders of the flows as specified in the standard EN149+A1:2009 [1] .",

For example, the flow through the respirator is a constant flow, and while, in the standard, breathing is mimicked, the flow applied in the test-rig is higher than the flow of a human being. The constant and higher flow is more challenging than the `human breathing' flow. The environmental conditions during the tests meet the requirements in the standard. However the breath of a human is specified in the standard on 37 _ 2 _C and the RH at 95 %. It can be argued that a moist respirator is more difficult for particles and air to penetrate than a dry respirator. It is therefore assumed that the tests in the test-rig are more challenging for the respirator. To ensure that no pathogens can come through the filter material via the moisture, the IfU of masks specify the duration of use. This duration of use may vary per masks. The Dutch authorities recommend a duration of three hours. In the Catharina hospital this duration of use is limited to two hours to increase safety [12] .",

The particles coming with the flow into the channel are measured at two locations with two separate particle counters (Lighthouse Hand-held 3016, Fremont CA, USA, figure 2d), one before and one after the location of the respirator. Additional to the iso-kinetic measurements system of the particle counters, the sampling for particle counting is performed via a horizontally placed Pitot tube. This ensures that the sampling is in the axial opposite direction of the air flow. The black dots between the mould and channel represent a seal to exclude air-leaks into the channel. To exclude the possibility of accumulating static electric charge in the channel wall, the metal channel is grounded to earth.
