            "text": "Within one to two days of infection with an influenza A or B virus, influenza disease most commonly manifests with the sudden onset of characteristic respiratory and systemic symptoms (Treanor, 2010). Respiratory symptoms, such as dry cough, pharyngitis, and nasal congestion and discharge, are often similar to those observed in other viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs). The systemic symptoms of influenza, including fever and chills, headache, myalgia, lethargy, and anorexia, develop early in the course of disease. Fever generally ranges from 100 \u00b0F to 104 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C to 40 \u00b0C), but may be as high as 106 \u00b0F (41 \u00b0C), with peak temperatures on the first day of symptoms and decreasing over three to eight days thereafter (Treanor, 2010). The prominent presence of systemic symptoms is often said to differentiate influenza from other viral URTIs. However, considerable syndromic overlap exists among these viral illnesses, particularly in the elderly; thus, the phrase \u201cinfluenza-like illness\u201d (ILI) is often employed to describe clinically indistinguishable viral URTIs (Widmer et al., 2012, Woolpert et al., 2012, Haas et al., 2013). In typical uncomplicated influenza, systemic symptoms generally resolve earlier than respiratory symptoms like cough and sore throat, which may persist for several days to a week after systemic symptoms abate (Treanor, 2010).",

Clinically, primary influenza viral pneumonia initially manifests like a typical uncomplicated URTI, but the acute infection rapidly progresses to the lower respiratory tract, accompanied by signs and symptoms of pneumonic involvement like cough, dyspnea, and hypoxemia. In contrast, secondary bacterial pneumonia occurs subsequent to a typical influenza URTI. After an initial clinical improvement lasting four to 14 days, recrudescence of fever, dyspnea, and cough with sputum signals the onset of bacterial pneumonia, particularly caused by staphylococcal or streptococcal species (Treanor, 2010).",

Though primary viral pneumonia occurs rarely overall, women in late pregnancy or the early post-partum period, the elderly, and those with comorbid cardiovascular or lung disease are at a higher risk of developing this complication (Treanor, 2010, Mertz et al., 2013). Influenza pandemics, while relatively infrequent, usually result in higher morbidity and mortality than seasonal epidemics. Pandemic influenza viruses arise from reassortment, the creation of a genetically and antigenically new virus by \u201cmixing-and-matching\u201d viral genes from human and/or animal influenza viruses. These \u201cantigenic shift\u201d events introduce an immunologically novel influenza virus into the human population, which has no pre-existing immunity to it. During recent pandemics, including those of 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009, younger people have been disproportionately affected by lower respiratory tract disease requiring hospitalization, relative to inter-pandemic years (Murata et al., 2007, Lapinsky, 2010, Treanor, 2010). Theories to explain the unusual morbidity and mortality of pandemic influenza among the young include an immunopathology specific to this age group (such as an antibody-dependent enhancement of disease in persons with particular, previous exposures to other seasonal influenza virus strains) and, conversely, immunoprotection in older adults (for example their exposure, many decades before, to influenza viruses that induced cross-protective immune responses that are not present in those who had yet to be born at that time) (Taubenberger and Morens, 2006).",

            "text": "The kinetic course of influenza virus replication in and then eradication from the human respiratory tract is often inferred from influenza challenge studies, in which human volunteers were experimentally inoculated with influenza viruses and then observed for symptomatic and virological measures of disease. A meta-analysis of human challenge studies (Carrat et al., 2008) found that, on average, viral shedding in nasal secretions begins within the first 24 h after inoculation, peaks on day 2, and ends by day 8 or 9 post-infection. Overall, only 66% of experimentally inoculated subjects developed disease; however, viral shedding could be detected even in asymptomatic persons. Average symptom scores peaked at three days post-infection (dpi), indicating that viral shedding precedes the development of disease by approximately one day (Carrat et al., 2008). The findings of this meta-analysis were echoed in a recent human challenge study (Y. Huang et al., 2011), in which 17 healthy volunteers were experimentally inoculated with influenza A/Wisconsin/67/2005 [H3N2], but only 9 (53%) developed symptomatic influenza. Infectious virus could be isolated from half of the asymptomatic volunteers, although viral shedding from symptomatic subjects was of greater magnitude and longer duration. Similar to the meta-analysis findings, in this study symptoms appeared, on average, between 1 and 2 days post-inoculation (range, 22 to 60 h). Changes in messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were quantified by microarray every 8 to 24 h throughout the course of the study, in order to describe for each subject a specific gene expression signature in response to influenza virus infection. Interestingly, symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects displayed characteristic yet dissimilar molecular transcriptional responses. These data suggest that, in humans, the absence of influenza symptoms does not signal an immunologically \u201cpassive\u201d state, but rather that transcriptionally different but equally \u201cactive\u201d host immune response programs are stimulated by influenza virus infection in symptomatic and asymptomatic hosts (Y. Huang et al., 2011).",

            "text": "There is still much that is unknown about the transmission of influenza viruses among humans. There are two main modes of transmission, contact and airborne, by which influenza and other respiratory viruses are thought to spread from person to person (IOM (Institute of Medicine), 2011; Pica and Bouvier, 2012). Contact transmission occurs by two routes, direct and indirect. In direct contact transmission, a susceptible person's hand becomes directly contaminated with infectious virus \u2013 perhaps by shaking the hand of an infected person, or by wiping a sick child's nose \u2013 and then the susceptible person inoculates himself by transferring infectious virus from his hand to his nose. Indirect contact transmission occurs when infectious virus is transferred from an inanimate object, or fomite, (such as a doorknob, telephone, or computer keyboard touched by an infected person) to the hand of a susceptible person, who then inoculates her own nasal mucosa by rubbing or touching her nose. In both cases of contact transmission, however, a contaminated hand or other body part plays a role in bringing infectious virus to the respiratory mucosa. In contrast, airborne transmission occurs when infectious virus inoculates the respiratory tract directly from the air, without a contaminated hand or other physical intermediate mediating its transport to the respiratory mucosa. It can occur by two modes: In droplet spray transmission, an infected person coughs or sneezes, expelling respiratory droplets, containing contagious virus particles, which impact directly on the nasal mucosa of a susceptible person. Aerosol (also called droplet nuclei) transmission occurs when water- and virus-laden respiratory droplets that are exhaled by an infected person desiccate, becoming light enough to remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours; these infectious aerosols can then be inhaled into the respiratory tract of a susceptible person to initiate infection (Pica and Bouvier, 2012).",

These experiments suggest that humans can be infected by both airborne- and contact-based transmission modes, but that contact modes may require a higher infectious dose. Observational studies of influenza outbreaks (Buxton Bridges et al., 2003) imply that both contact and airborne routes can play a role in the human-to-human transmission of influenza viruses. Recent reviews of the literature (Brankston et al., 2007, Tellier, 2009) have reached conflicting conclusions regarding the relative importance of airborne, droplet, and contact-based spread among humans, and uncertainty remains on this issue, having significant implications for infection control and public health planning (IOM (Institute of Medicine), 2011).",

During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, observational studies estimated secondary attack rates ranging between 4% and 51% among household contacts of index cases with influenza, with an average of 10\u201320% (France et al., 2009, Morgan et al., 2009, Cauchemez et al., 2009, Yang et al., 2009, Carcione et al., 2011, Glatman-Freedman et al., 2012). Although the method of case ascertainment, clinical or virological, affected secondary attack rate estimates, the presence of children within households did as well, with higher rates of infection in children than in adults (Glatman-Freedman et al., 2012). For 2009 pandemic influenza, the serial interval, the time that elapses between the infection of an index case and subsequent transmission of disease to a secondary contact, has been estimated in most studies to fall in the range of two and a half to three days (France et al., 2009, Morgan et al., 2009, Cauchemez et al., 2009, Yang et al., 2009, Donnelly et al., 2011). In these studies, the majority of secondary transmission events occurred just before or just after the onset of influenza symptoms in the index case (Cauchemez et al., 2009). Altogether, these data indicate that influenza viruses have an incubation period of one to two days in humans, with secondary transmission to a subsequent host occurring within another one to two days.",

In a study of healthy adults, a similar amount of airborne respiratory droplets, on average, were produced by counting aloud from 1 to 100 as by coughing 20 times (Xie et al., 2009). Whether the same would be true in influenza virus-infected people is unknown, although influenza virus infection does enhance the generation of cough aerosols (Lindsley et al., 2012). In a small qualitative study, influenza virus could be detected in the exhalations of infected persons during normal tidal breathing or talking but not during coughing (Stelzer-Braid et al., 2009). More recent quantitative studies have assessed the production of respiratory particles by influenza patients while breathing or coughing, but not both maneuvers side-by-side (Lindsley et al., 2010, Lindsley et al., 2012, Milton et al., 2013). Thus, the transmission of influenza viruses among humans is likely affected, in small or large part, both by host physiology and by host immune competence overall, and by immune control of influenza viruses in particular.",

However, the nonspecific innate immune response, while effective, can be locally destructive if not appropriately contained. Certain influenza viruses, such as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A/H5N1 strains, can trigger an overly inflammatory innate immune response, often called \u201ccytokine storm\u201d (de Jong et al., 2006, Peiris et al., 2009). Certain persons seem particularly susceptible to developing cytokine-driven clinical syndromes like sepsis and acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS), suggesting a potential genetic basis for the immune dysregulation that is thought to be a major factor in severe human influenza (Oshansky and Thomas, 2012, Tisoncik et al., 2012). The role of local inflammation in influenza pathogenesis in humans is not entirely clear, however (Oshansky and Thomas, 2012). Mouse studies have demonstrated that the local inflammatory milieu in the influenza virus-infected respiratory tract can differ greatly from the cytokine profile elaborated in PBMCs. Human cytokine responses to influenza have been mainly assayed in PBMCs, not in the respiratory tract, and the majority of human studies have been observational, which can provide correlations between peripheral cytokine profiles and clinical outcomes in influenza disease but cannot show causality or provide mechanistic details. Thus, while the pathogenesis of severe influenza is thought to result from a dysregulated innate immune response in both mice and men, confirmatory data in humans are scarce (Oshansky and Thomas, 2012).",

In humans, B-cell production of influenza virus-specific antibodies, particularly those directed at the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA; the receptor-binding protein) and neuraminidase (NA; the receptor-destroying enzyme) has been shown to confer protection from influenza virus infection or pathogenicity. Non-neutralizing antibodies, such as those directed at the highly conserved matrix 2 (M2) protein and nucleoprotein (NP), can aid in the immune response without providing sterilizing immunity, although the mechanisms in humans require further elucidation (Oshansky and Thomas, 2012). In a process called antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), the variable region of an influenza virus-specific antibody binds to viral proteins expressed on the surface of an infected host cell, while its Fc region interacts with CD16, an Fc receptor on the surface of NK cells; the subsequent NK cell activation initiates lysis of the infected cell (Hashimoto et al., 1983a, Hashimoto et al., 1983b, van de Sandt et al., 2012, Jegaskanda et al., 2013). Humanized mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against the immunodominant but genetically labile HA \u201chead\u201d region, where receptor binding occurs, are less potent inducers of human NK cell activation, and thus ADCC, than are neutralizing antibodies directed against the HA \u201cstalk\u201d region, which is less immunogenic but more highly conserved among influenza A subtypes (DiLillo et al., 2014). In mice, antibodies can also act as opsonins, enhancing the ability of phagocytes to engulf and present antigens to T lymphocytes, though this mechanism has yet to be convincingly demonstrated in human influenza (Oshansky and Thomas, 2012, Bodewes et al., 2013).",

            "text": "The cellular immune response to influenza virus infection includes activation of virus-specific T lymphocytes (van de Sandt et al., 2012). CD4+ T cells coordinate and regulate the immune response against influenza virus infection by recognizing viral peptide epitopes bound to MHC class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The concurrent cytokine milieu directs effector CD4+ T cell differentiation into T helper 1 (Th1) or T helper 2 (Th2) cells. Th1 cells produce IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2, which stimulate cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses that eradicate virus-infected cells and promote viral clearance. Th2 cells secrete cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, which are involved in the activation and differentiation of B cells to produce and refine virus-specific antibody responses. CD8+ T cells recognize viral epitopes bound to MHC class I molecules on APCs that have migrated from the site of infection into the draining lymph nodes. Activated CD8+ T cells then migrate back to the site of infection to identify and lyse influenza virus-infected cells, thereby curtailing viral replication (van de Sandt et al., 2012). Although only minimal indirect evidence exists for the role of CTLs in the human immune response against influenza viruses, activation of T lymphocytes appears to induce the formation of memory T cell pools in both mice and humans, which enable a more potent and rapid adaptive immune response in future influenza virus infections (Oshansky and Thomas, 2012, van de Sandt et al., 2012).",

Upon infection with certain influenza virus strains, mice display marked anorexia and demonstrate behaviors consistent with physical discomfort or lethargy, such as huddling, hunching, and fur ruffling from lack of grooming and dehydration. Unlike humans, though, mice have been reported to become hypothermic upon influenza virus infection, rather than mounting a febrile response (Bouvier and Lowen, 2010). Importantly, influenza in mice characteristically manifests as a primary viral pneumonia, which is demonstrated clinically by labored breathing and cyanosis and post-mortem by severe pulmonary histopathology (Tripp and Tompkins, 2009, Bouvier and Lowen, 2010, Fukushi et al., 2011).

Thus, a few mouse-adapted virus strains are frequently used in the mouse model, including two influenza A/H1N1 isolates from the 1930s and an influenza B virus isolated in 1940: A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR/8), A/WSN/1933 (WSN), and B/Lee/1940. Studies requiring an influenza A/H3N2-subtype virus are often carried out with X-31, a 6:2 genetic reassortant encoding the HA and NA genes of an A/H3N2 virus isolated in 1968, in a backbone comprising the six internal genes of PR/8 (Bouvier and Lowen, 2010). These antiquated mouse-adapted viruses are not necessarily genetically or antigenically representative of influenza viruses currently circulating among humans. The WSN strain in particular causes disease manifestations not typically seen in human influenza, such as a highly pathogenic neurotropism attributable to the plasminogen-binding activity of its NA protein (Goto et al., 2001). Primary human virus isolates typically have to be serially passaged through mice before they will productively infect and cause disease in this species (Tripp and Tompkins, 2009); however, notable exceptions include the 1918 H1N1 pandemic strain; most highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A/H5N1 viruses and selected low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) subtypes; some H7 subtype viruses, including the novel influenza A/H7N9 virus that emerged in China in 2013; and the 2009 pandemic influenza A/H1N1 (\"H1N1pdm09\") strain (Bouvier and Lowen, 2010, Hai et al., 2013).",

Over the years, the descendants of the original \u201cSwiss mice\u201d were dispersed widely to researchers and commercial breeders around the world, becoming the founding stock of many of the in- and outbred mouse lineages used in scientific research today (Chia et al., 2005). Eaton's experiments comprised eight intranasally inoculated Swiss mice, co-housed in large glass jars with eight uninfected contact mice. Inoculated mice usually died within a week, but contact mice rarely succumbed to infection. Instead, after 10 to 11 days, they were necropsied for evidence of lung consolidations characteristic of influenza pneumonia, which would imply that infection via transmission from the inoculated mice had occurred. Eaton reported highly efficient transmission of PR/8 and WS viruses in his model; depending on the experimental conditions, as many as 88% or 100% of contact mice (for PR/8 and the WS strain, respectively) would display typical influenza lung pathology. Transmission of these influenza virus strains was also observed among Swiss mice obtained from seven different breeders. In general, Eaton found that mice inoculated with higher doses of PR/8 or WS viruses were more likely to transmit to na\u00efve contact mice; that peak transmission efficiency was achieved when contact mice were exposed to inoculated mice between 24 and 48 h post-inoculation for at least 72 h of contact time; and that older mice were more susceptible to infection than newly weaned pups (Eaton, 1940).",

Finally, in the 1960s, Schulman and Kilbourne succeeded in establishing a murine transmission model with CFW (\u201cCarworth Farms White\u201d) (Schulman and Kilbourne, 1963b, Schulman and Kilbourne, 1963a) or MF-1 (\u201cManor Farms 1\u201d) (Schulman, 1967a, Schulman, 1967b) mice, both commercially bred stocks derived from the Rockefeller Swiss mice (Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, 1966, Lyle and Jutila, 1968, Chia et al., 2005). Schulman studied influenza virus transmission between infected and susceptible mice not only when they were physically commingled in the same cage, as Eaton had done, but also when infected and susceptible mice were separated on either side of a 3/4-inch (1.9 cm) thick wire-mesh partition, through which air could flow but no direct contact could occur (Schulman and Kilbourne, 1962, Schulman and Kilbourne, 1963a). Similar to Eaton's method, transmission to na\u00efve mice could only be confirmed after necropsy. Schulman, however, verified that viable influenza virus could be re-isolated from the lungs of the exposed mice, by inoculating lung homogenates into embryonated hen's eggs (Schulman and Kilbourne, 1963a).",

The mouse-adapted influenza B/Lee/40 virus also transmitted poorly in this model, with only 10% efficiency (Schulman, 1967a). However, many influenza A/H2N2 isolates, which had begun to circulate in the human population after the 1957 \u201cAsian flu\u201d pandemic, transmitted among mice with comparative efficiency, including the mouse-adapted strains A/Japan/305/1957 (62.5% transmission rate), A/Rockville/1957 (40%), A/Ann Arbor/1960 (55%), and A/Bethesda/10/1963 (35%). Even the human H2N2 isolate A/Rockefeller Institute/5/1957, which had not been previously mouse-adapted, transmitted with 30% efficiency among mice (Schulman, 1968). In this mouse transmission model, Schulman made many prescient observations regarding the mammalian transmissibility of influenza viruses, some of which confirmed Eaton's earlier findings and some of which have been subsequently observed in other animal models. For example, rapid airflow and high humidity reduced the efficiency of airborne influenza virus transmission among mice (Schulman and Kilbourne, 1962); transmission occurred most efficiently when inoculated and susceptible animals were together during the time period of 24 to 48 h after inoculation (Schulman and Kilbourne, 1963a); older mice were more susceptible to being infected by transmission than were younger mice (Schulman and Kilbourne, 1963b); transmission efficiency in mice depended more on the inoculated animals being \u201cgood transmitters\u201d than on the exposed animals being particularly susceptible to infection, even though \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad transmitters\u201d demonstrated equivalent viral loads, infection kinetics, and lung pathology (Schulman and Kilbourne, 1963b); transmission efficiency was higher in the winter than in the summer, even when transmission experiments were conducted in temperature- and humidity-controlled environments (Schulman and Kilbourne, 1963b); and a virus that transmitted well could be sampled from the air surrounding infected mice at higher titers than could a virus that transmitted poorly, even though the two strains demonstrated identical lung titers and pathology in the infected mice (Schulman, 1967a).",

Induced levels have been shown to differ according to the strain of mouse, as demonstrated by PR/8 infection of inbred DBA/2J and C57BL/6 mice (Srivastava et al., 2009). The cytokines and chemokines IL-1\u03b1, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12, G-CSF, CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL3 (MIP-1\u03b1), CCL5 (RANTES), CXCL1 (KC), CXCL2 (MIP-2), CXCL9 (MIG), and CXCL10 (IP-10) were found at higher levels in the BAL fluid of DBA/2 compared to C57BL/6 mice, correlating with the DBA/2 strain's increased susceptibility to infection and to lung pathology. As in humans (de Jong et al., 2006, Peiris et al., 2009, Tisoncik et al., 2012), it has been proposed that an overly inflammatory innate immune response results in immune-mediated lung pathology in mice, and the DBA/J strain appears particularly susceptible to cytokine storm (Srivastava et al., 2009)",

PB1-F2, an accessory protein that is expressed from an alternate reading frame in the PB1 gene in some but not all influenza A viruses, has been associated with greater pathogenicity in mice (Gocnikova and Russ, 2007). The 1918 pandemic influenza strain A/Brevig Mission/1918 [H1N1] encodes an N66S polymorphism in the PB1-F2 protein, which has also been observed in HPAI H5N1 strains. When BALB/c mice were inoculated with either the 1918 pandemic strain or a point mutant in which the serine at position 66 was reverted back to the more typical asparagine residue, the 1918 S66N mutant was less infectious and pathogenic than the wild-type 1918 virus. The pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1 were detected at significantly lower levels in the 1918 S66N mutant-infected mice (Conenello et al., 2007), suggesting that this polymorphism plays a role in inducing high cytokine levels in mice infected with the 1918 pandemic strain.",

The authors suggest that the 1918 HA protein is responsible for stimulating this particular cytokine profile, which induces macrophage activation and neutrophil chemotaxis that may subsequently lead to acute lung injury (Kobasa et al., 2004). In BALB/c mice, a human seasonal influenza A/H1N1 virus encoding the 1918 HA and NA proteins induced a severe inflammatory pathology, consisting primarily of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils (Tumpey et al., 2005b). Mice infected with the 1918 HA/NA-expressing virus displayed significantly higher lung levels of the pro-inflammatory markers IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, CCL3 (MIP-1\u03b1), and CXCL2 (MIP-2) than did mice infected with the seasonal virus itself. Compared to control mice, mice depleted of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils prior to infection demonstrated significantly lower levels of these cytokines and IFN-\u03b1, as well as higher viral titers in the lungs and viral spread to the brain (Tumpey et al., 2005b). Together, these data suggest that the HA and perhaps NA proteins of the 1918 influenza virus induce high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the mouse lung, with alveolar macrophages and neutrophils playing a critical role in their production. While this inflammatory response is important for controlling viral replication and extrapulmonary spread, it also results in immune-mediated acute lung injury in the infected mouse.",

            "text": "Functional genomics has also provided a comprehensive overview of the effect of influenza infection on global host mRNA levels (Fornek et al., 2007). BALB/c mice were infected with the mouse-adapted WSN strain, or two WSN-based reassortants, one expressing the 1918 influenza HA and NA, and the other expressing the HA and NA of the recent seasonal human influenza isolate A/New Caledonia/20/99 [H1N1] (Kash et al., 2004). Both WSN and the 1918-HA/NA:WSN reassortant induced severe histopathological changes in infected mouse lungs, while the New Caledonia-HA/NA:WSN reassortant was relatively attenuated in the mouse model. Gene expression profiling performed on lungs harvested from infected mice revealed that, at early time points, mice infected with the virulent WSN and the 1918-HA/NA:WSN reassortant viruses demonstrated increased activation of genes involved in inflammation, lymphocyte activation, and stress response, relative to the gene expression in the lungs of mice infected with the New Caledonia-HA/NA:WSN recombinant virus (Kash et al., 2004). Similar studies with reassortants between the 1918 influenza virus and the recent human influenza isolate A/Texas/36/1991 [H1N1] showed variable histopathology in the lungs, with the 1918 virus causing the most severe damage and Texas/91 the least, with the various reassortants causing an intermediate phenotype (Kash et al., 2006). This differential pathology was mirrored by the expression of immune-related genes; the 1918 virus again induced the most significant and earliest expression of immune-related genes, followed in timing and magnitude by the reassortants and then by Texas/91 itself. Many of the genes that were significantly upregulated in 1918-infected mouse lungs were involved in inflammatory responses and cell death pathways. Thus, the rapidity and enhanced virulence of 1918 influenza virus infection in mice correlated with an increased expression of inflammatory response genes (Kash et al., 2006). These studies and others demonstrate that, in influenza virus infections, innate immune gene expression correlates with the severity of pulmonary pathology, implicating the regulation of the immune response in disease outcomes in influenza.",

Inoculation of ferrets with human isolates of seasonal influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B viruses generally results in an upper respiratory tract infection featuring fever, nasal congestion, malaise, and anorexia, similar to uncomplicated influenza in humans. Sneezing is a prominent clinical sign often observed in influenza virus-infected ferrets (Tripp and Tompkins, 2009), but less so in people. A dry cough is more typical of human influenza (Call et al., 2005, Treanor, 2010), while sneezing occurs frequently with common cold viruses like rhino- and coronaviruses (Turner, 2010). As in complicated influenza in humans, both the reconstructed 1918 pandemic influenza virus and HPAI A/H5N1 strains cause more severe disease and associated histopathology in the ferret lower respiratory tract. This differential disease pattern may, in part, be attributable to receptor distribution in the human and ferret respiratory tracts (Shinya et al., 2006, van Riel et al., 2006, van Riel et al., 2007, Bouvier and Lowen, 2010).",

            "text": "In ferrets, influenza virus infection of the central nervous system (CNS) is particularly common with HPAI H5N1 viruses. It can also be observed with human seasonal influenza virus isolates, although their neurovirulence may be strain- and dose-dependent (Zitzow et al., 2002, Kwon et al., 2010, van den Brand et al., 2012). In contrast, influenza-associated encephalitis or encephalopathy is rarely reported in human influenza, and evidence of virus replication in the human CNS is limited (Studahl, 2003, Gambotto et al., 2007, Fonseca and Lavoie, 2014). A study comparing two HPAI H5N1 strains with varying lethality in ferrets (Plourde et al., 2012) found no significant difference in weight loss, viral titers, or respiratory tract pathology. However, all 10 ferrets challenged with A/Vietnam/1203/2004 died, after displaying prominent neurological signs such as seizure, torticollis, and paralysis. Post-mortem, the challenge virus was recovered at high titers from the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, cerebellum and brain stem, and histopathological lesions were widespread throughout these anatomical regions. Of ferrets challenged with A/Hong Kong/483/1997, only 20% (2 of 10) died, no neurological signs were observed, no viable virus was detected in the CNS, and histopathological lesions were seen only in the olfactory system. Thus, the lethality of HPAI H5N1 infection in the ferret model may be due, at least in part, to viral replication in the CNS and subsequent neurological dysfunction, rather than to respiratory tract pathology alone (Plourde et al., 2012). If so, this marks an important difference from human H5N1 influenza, in which most patients die of progressive respiratory failure, complicated by ARDS and multi-organ dysfunction (Gambotto et al., 2007).",

Other early influenza researchers noted that ferrets occasionally arrived from the breeder already immune to experimental inoculation with laboratory strains of influenza virus. Serum from these animals was shown to contain antibodies capable of neutralizing PR/8 and another contemporary human influenza strain, suggesting that some members of the ferret colony had experienced prior infection with influenza virus, either through ferret-to-ferret or perhaps human-to-ferret transmission (Francis and Magill, 1935). Ferret-to-human transmission was suspected in the case of a lab worker tending to infected ferrets at the Rockefeller Institute (Francis, 1934), as well as in the case of Dr. C. H. Stuart-Harris, an influenza researcher who was examining recently inoculated ferrets, including one that sneezed on him (Smith and Stuart-Harris, 1936). Both men developed influenza-like illness, and their nasal washes, inoculated intranasally into previously uninfected ferrets, induced typical ferret influenza disease.",

They observed that co-caged ferrets readily transmitted disease one to another, but that ferrets in side-by-side solid metal cages did not. When infected and na\u00efve ferrets were placed in open wire-mesh cages, however, disease transmission was frequently observed when cages were up to 5 ft (1.5 m) apart, even when exposed ferrets were placed several feet above infected ferrets, to preclude droplet spray transmission associated with sneezing. When windows in the animal room were opened to improve ventilation, ferret-to-ferret transmission was abolished. Transmission experiments were also conducted with infected and susceptible ferrets in separate cages at either end of straight, S-shaped, and U-shaped ducts 100 in2 (644 cm2) in cross-section and ranging between 5 and 9 ft (1.5 and 2.7 m) long. Air was pulled through the ducts with a fan, situated so that air currents passed from the infected ferrets' cage and through the susceptible ferrets' cage prior to being exhausted from the duct. Transmission of infection to the susceptible ferrets occurred at a range of air speeds between 3 and 14 linear feet per minute (59 and 275 liters per minute), even around the 180\u00b0 bend in the U-shaped duct. Andrewes and Glover interpreted these findings to be most consistent with ferret-to-ferret transmission occurring primarily via aerosols (also called droplet nuclei) that were small enough to float upwards through still air or to be pulled around the air duct corners without impacting on its walls (Andrewes and Glover, 1941).",

            "text": "Influenza virus transmissibility by air between ferrets has been positively associated with the amount of infectious particles exhaled by the infected (virus-donor) ferret. Using reassortants between human H1N1pdm09 and swine H1N1 isolates, Lakdawala et al. (2011) found a positive correlation between inter-ferret transmission efficiency and the amount of vRNA-containing particles (measured by quantitative RT-PCR) collected from the air surrounding the ferrets' cages. Higher NA enzymatic activity and a filamentous morphology were also characteristic of the more transmissible viruses. With pre-2009 seasonal sH1N1 and 2009 pandemic H1N1pdm09 strains of varying pathogenicity in ferrets, Koster et al. (2012) evaluated airborne transmission between infected and susceptible ferrets in airflow-controlled chambers, quantifying the size, number, and vRNA content of airborne respiratory particles. They found that high vRNA levels in the air did not predict efficient transmissibility for a given strain; interestingly, the more days that passed between donor ferret inoculation and its pairing with a susceptible recipient ferret, the less efficient transmission between them became, even though airborne vRNA levels remained relatively constant over the first 5 dpi. Even though infected ferrets were maintaining high viral particle output post-inoculation, the infectiousness of those particles appeared to be declining; thus, vRNA content in air samples may not be an accurate surrogate marker for infectious airborne virus. The strains causing overt disease also displayed the least efficient transmission, despite high vRNA levels in the air surrounding infected ferrets. This finding suggests that a more robust inflammatory response may reduce the viability of exhaled virus, without adversely affecting the quantity of vRNA-containing particles shed from the respiratory tract. Gustin et al. (2013) found that ferrets infected with highly transmissible human influenza viruses both exhaled and sneezed out more respiratory particles overall than those infected with poorly transmissible avian strains. In ferrets infected with transmissible human isolates, infectious virus particles in the respirable range (< 5 \u03bcm) could be recovered in greater amounts from their exhaled breath (3\u201311 pfu) and sneezes (up to 8 pfu) than from the exhaled breath (0\u20136 pfu) or sneezes (up to 4 pfu) of ferrets infected with avian strains. Though the authors report statistical significance of these results, it is important to note that the majority of ferrets in both human and avian virus groups exhaled or sneezed no detectable infectious virus at all. The low recoverability rate of live virus particles in this system introduces the possibility of significant error; according to Poisson's distribution, when rare events are expected (e.g., 10 or fewer pfu per assay), there is a greater than 5% probability that 4 fewer to 4 more pfu will be observed in any given replicate (Gumbel, 1941). Capturing infectious virus-containing particles from exhaled breath remains a technical hurdle to a fuller understanding of the aerobiology of influenza viruses (Milton et al., 2013).",

The ferret model has also been used to assess the mammalian transmissibility of oseltamivir-resistant human H1N1 (Herlocher et al., 2004, Yen et al., 2005, Duan et al., 2010, Hurt et al., 2010, Kiso et al., 2010, Abed et al., 2011) and H3N2 (Herlocher et al., 2002, Yen et al., 2005, Memoli et al., 2010) isolates. These studies, as a whole, have shown that the prevalence of drug resistance among human isolates is proportional to their ferret transmissibility. Oseltamivir resistance is rarely seen in human influenza A/H3N2 isolates, which have demonstrated moderate to severe impairment in ferret transmissibility when encoding resistance mutations. However, human seasonal influenza A/sH1N1 viruses from 2008 to 2009, which were virtually 100% oseltamivir-resistant, transmitted highly efficiently in the ferret model.",

Experiments that purport to show a difference between two or more influenza virus isolates are often conducted with only 2 to 4 ferret pairs per group, due in part to the cost, size, and husbandry requirements of ferrets. This sample size lacks sufficient statistical power to demonstrate a small difference that truly exists, leading to a Type II (i.e., \u201cfalse negative\u201d) error (Cohen, 2012, Nishiura et al., 2013). It has been argued that pooling the data from several small but similar experimental groups increases power (Belser et al., 2013b). However, the degree of similarity among the groups to be combined must be explicitly considered, as heterogeneity compromises the reliability of conclusions drawn from pooled data. In general, a well-designed experiment with a sample size adequate to demonstrate a significant difference will give more precise and reliable results than a post-hoc meta-analysis of several smaller and variably similar experimental groups (Walker et al., 2008).",

However, immunological studies in ferrets have been limited by the lack of readily available reagents, such as recombinant ferret cytokines for use in ELISA or ferret-specific antibodies that recognize immune cell-surface markers (Belser et al., 2009, Tripp and Tompkins, 2009, Bouvier and Lowen, 2010). In some cases, reagents specific to other species, such as mink, dogs, and even humans, have shown sufficient cross-reactivity with ferret immune mediators (Rutigliano et al., 2008, Martel and Aasted, 2009). A commercially available canine microarray assay has been used to analyze differential immune gene expression after infection of ferrets with either low-pathogenicity human seasonal isolates or moderate-to-highly pathogenic influenza viruses (an avian H5N1 strain and a human H1N1pdm09 isolate) (Cameron et al., 2008, Rowe et al., 2010). In general, interferon response genes were expressed earlier and to higher levels in ferrets infected with the higher-pathogenicity strains, in particular a robust upregulation of CXCL10 (IP-10) that has also been seen in fatal human cases of H5N1 influenza (Peiris et al., 2009).",

Upon infection with human and avian-origin influenza A strains, ferrets displayed nasal wash titers and symptom severity that were positively correlated with expression levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IFN-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b2 mRNA in the nasal turbinates. Higher levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 were also significantly associated with more efficient airborne transmissibility, which ranged from 67 to 100% for the human isolates to 0% for the H5N1 strains (Maines et al., 2011). Also similar to mice, depletion of alveolar macrophages resulted in worsening of influenza disease in ferrets infected with an H1N1pdm09 isolate, including higher viral loads and greater inflammatory cell infiltrates (Kim et al., 2013). However in some of these studies, higher viral loads in respiratory tissues have been observed with the more pathogenic influenza virus infections, and thus the pro-inflammatory response may result from enhanced viral replication, rather than from particular attributes of the virus itself.",

            "text": "As in mice, some virus strain-specific differences in ferret pathogenesis can be attributed to certain genetic polymorphisms. For instance, introducing the open reading frame of the PB1-F2 accessory protein, as encoded by the 1918 influenza virus, into the seasonal influenza isolate A/USSR/90/1977 [H1N1] prevented the upregulation of mRNA transcripts for the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8 in ferret PBMC-derived macrophages infected ex vivo (Meunier and von Messling, 2012). USSR/77 itself, which encodes a truncated PB1-F2 protein that lacks the C-terminal domain that appears to mediate its inflammatory, antiviral, and pro-apoptotic effects in mice, induced only low-level, late expression of these genes, while USSR/77 with a complete knockout of the PB1-F2 open reading frame stimulated significantly higher cytokine mRNA expression. However, unlike in mice, expression of the 1918 PB1-F2, encoding the N66S polymorphism, resulted in a slight but non-significant enhancement in pathogenicity and equivalent viral replication in the lungs of infected ferrets (Meunier and von Messling, 2012).",

Kits displayed significantly attenuated disease, compared to adult ferrets (4 to 6 months old), despite similar viral loads in the respiratory tract. Their immune response, however, was quite different. In both peripheral blood and lungs, the kits mounted a predominantly mononuclear cell (lymphocyte and monocyte) response, and lung pathology was relatively mild, including bronchiolar desquamation and debris plugging. In contrast, the adults displayed higher granulocyte (neutrophil, eosinophil, and basophil) counts in the peripheral blood and more granulocytic infiltrate in the lungs, which was associated with bronchiolitis and alveolitis. Kits also demonstrated significant, early upregulation of mRNA encoding the pro-inflammatory chemokines CXCL9 (MIG) and CXCL10 (IP-10), as well as the regulatory cytokine IL-10; at 3 dpi, CXCL9, IL-10, and TGF-\u03b21 mRNA levels were significantly higher in the lungs of kits than in those of adults. Thus, ferret kits mounted a distinctly different immune response, paralleling clinical outcomes in the 2009 influenza pandemic, in which children generally manifested milder influenza disease than adults (Huang et al., 2012).",

Guinea pigs are readily infected by human, avian, and swine influenza isolates, without prior adaptation (Bouvier and Lowen, 2010). Of the human and avian isolates tested to date, the median infectious dose required to initiate infection in the guinea pig by intranasal inoculation (GPID50) is on the order of 1 to 100 pfu per animal, with a geometric mean of approximately 10 pfu (Lowen et al., 2006, Bouvier et al., 2008, Steel et al., 2009, Gabbard et al., 2013). These published GPID50 values are comparable to the median ferret infectious dose (FID50) that has been reported for several influenza virus strains administered intranasally (Toms et al., 1977, Gustin et al., 2011, Roberts et al., 2011). The median intranasal infectious dose for humans (HID50) is in the range of 100 to 500 median tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50) (Tellier, 2009), which is a different method of virus titration but should be within one order of magnitude of the corresponding pfu value (Watanabe et al., 2012). The HID50 for influenza virus delivered by aerosol, rather than by intranasal inoculation, has been estimated to be on the order of 1 TCID50, or more than 100 times less than the intranasal HID50 (Tellier, 2009), while the FID50 for both aerosol and intranasal inoculation routes appears to be roughly equivalent (Gustin et al., 2011, MacInnes et al., 2011). Experimental aerosol inoculation of guinea pigs has been performed, but the delivered dose and thus the GPID50 were not explicitly calculated (Mubareka et al., 2009).",

Viral replication can occur in the lungs, but it is typically at lower levels than is seen in the nasopharynx (Lowen et al., 2006, Gabbard et al., 2013, Seibert et al., 2013). Despite productive infection, however, influenza viruses do not typically cause overt signs of disease in guinea pigs, as they do in ferrets (Bouvier and Lowen, 2010). Signs such as ruffled fur, listlessness, and anorexia are either absent or so subtle as to not be readily apparent in guinea pigs. Increased nasal mucus can be appreciated in infected animals (Tang and Chong, 2009, Bouvier and Lowen, 2010), but in our experience this sign is not consistently obvious and would be difficult to follow clinically, although it can be appreciated histopathologically (Tang and Chong, 2009).",

However, it is not known if the efficient transmission of influenza viruses among humans requires expulsive events like coughing or sneezing, as opposed to the less forceful but more continuous exhalation of respiratory droplets during tidal breathing and talking. Akin to humans, guinea pigs are social animals that communicate through sound, making a variety of high- and low-frequency vocalizations by altering the tension of the glottal folds and causing them to vibrate by forcing air through them (Berryman, 1976); a similar, though more powerfully expulsive physiology underlies the cough mechanism (Zayas et al., 2012).",

However, Mubareka et al. (2009) found that an influenza A virus isolate that transmitted efficiently by air between guinea pigs could be sampled from the air surrounding infected guinea pigs with higher infectious titers than could a virus that transmitted poorly, despite both isolates demonstrating similar peak nasopharyngeal virus titers. These results echo those of Schulman and Kilbourne in the mouse transmission model (Schulman, 1967a) and suggest that respiratory lavage or tissue virus titers may not accurately reflect the amount of infectious virus actually being released into the air during respiration. Similar air-sampling experiments in people with influenza have also found a lack of strong correlation between nasopharyngeal and exhaled viral loads (Milton et al., 2013).",

Guinea pigs infected with 106 egg infectious doses (EID50) of an HPAI H5N1 virus exhibited only mild listlessness and then recovered (Kwon et al., 2009), while ferrets inoculated with the same dose of the same H5N1 virus experienced severe disease and died by 5 to 7 dpi (Govorkova et al., 2005). Another HPAI H5N1 virus, inoculated into ferrets and guinea pigs at similar doses, achieved comparable nasal wash and lung viral loads. However, the ferrets' mean maximal weight loss was 16%, and 3 of 3 ferrets died or were euthanized by day 7. In contrast, all guinea pigs survived, with an average peak weight loss of 7% (Maines et al., 2005, Van Hoeven et al., 2009). No viable virus could be isolated from the non-respiratory tissues of guinea pigs infected with a panel of HPAI H5N1 viruses (Gao et al., 2009), suggesting that systemic spread is absent or at least undetectable. The lack of neurovirulence of H5N1 viruses in the guinea pig may, in part, account for the very different morbidity of avian-origin strains in this species, relative to that which can be seen in ferrets (Plourde et al., 2012).",

At various combinations of temperature (5, 20, or 30 \u00b0C) and RH (20, 35, 50, 65, and 80%), the airborne transmission efficiency of A/Panama/2007/1999 [H3N2] (Pan/99) has been assessed in 8 to 12 guinea pig pairs per environmental condition (Lowen et al., 2007, Lowen et al., 2008, Steel et al., 2011). Overall, the efficiency of transmission by airborne routes increased as temperature decreased. The same general trend towards increased transmission efficiency was observed with decreasing humidity; however, at 20 \u00b0C, transmission rates followed a bimodal pattern, being least efficient at both high (80%) and mid-range (50%) RHs, more efficient at moderate\u2013high (65%) RH, and most efficient at low (20\u201335%) RH (Fig. 1\n). The same inverse correlation between transmission efficiency and ambient temperature has since been demonstrated in influenza A/sH1N1, A/H1N1pdm09, and influenza B viruses (Steel et al., 2011, Bouvier et al., 2012, Pica et al., 2012). These laboratory experiments suggest that wintertime weather conditions may play a role in the seasonality of influenza epidemics in temperate climates.",

For example, prior to 2008, the vast majority of in vitro and in vivo data suggested that oseltamivir resistance mutations in the influenza virus NA came at some cost to viral fitness, leading many at that time to conclude that most oseltamivir-resistant viruses were \u201cunlikely to be of clinical consequence,\u201d as noted in a recent review (Govorkova, 2013). However, in the winter of 2007\u20132008, coincident with the circulation of a new antigenic drift variant characterized by A/Brisbane/59/2007 [H1N1], a sudden increase in the prevalence of oseltamivir resistance among seasonal influenza A/sH1N1 virus isolates was noted. Within 5 months, 25% of European sH1N1 isolates encoded the NA-H274Y oseltamivir-resistance mutation; by 2009, it was found in 96% of sH1N1 isolates worldwide (Bouvier et al., 2012). Enhanced transmission efficiency among humans was one of only a few hypotheses that could account for the unprecedented, exponential increase in prevalence of the NA-H274Y mutation in sH1N1 viruses (Chao et al., 2012). With paired oseltamivir-sensitive and -resistant Brisbane/59-like clinical isolates from the New York State Department of Health, it was shown that the oseltamivir-resistant isolate transmitted more efficiently among guinea pigs than its oseltamivir-sensitive counterpart. With various point mutants of and reassortants between the oseltamivir-sensitive and -resistant isolates, the enhanced transmissibility of oseltamivir-resistant Brisbane/59-like viruses could be attributed to expression of oseltamivir-resistant NA, specifically the residues H275Y and/or D354G, which were characteristic of the resistant viruses (Bouvier et al., 2012). Because guinea pigs are less expensive than ferrets to purchase and maintain, these experiments assessed four different recombinant viruses, in 8 guinea pig pairs per virus, in order to reveal a small but statistically significant fitness advantage conferred primarily by the oseltamivir-resistant Brisbane/59-like NA alone.",

To assess whether the more robust viral replication in guinea pigs housed at 5 \u00b0C resulted from a cold-induced impairment in host innate immune defenses, they quantified by qRT-PCR the mRNA expression of innate immune effectors in the nasal turbinates of Pan/99-infected guinea pigs housed at either 5 or 20 \u00b0C. In both groups of guinea pigs, expression of Mx1, TLR3, MDA5, IRF7, STAT1, IL-1\u03b2, CCL2 (MCP1), CCL5 (RANTES), and CCL7 (MCP3) mRNAs were upregulated, while expression of TNF-\u03b1, TBK1, IRF5, and IFN-\u03b3 mRNAs were not. They found that CCL5 mRNA expression was greater in guinea pigs at 5 \u00b0C, while peak levels of IL-1\u03b2 and MDA5 were higher in guinea pigs at 20 \u00b0C. Altogether, it appeared as though innate immune signaling was not significantly compromised in guinea pigs housed at 5 \u00b0C, suggesting a different mechanism may be responsible for their higher nasopharyngeal viral loads, compared to animals at 20 \u00b0C (Lowen et al., 2007).",

Virus challenge was delivered by two routes, either by direct intranasal inoculation of virus, or by exposure to an acutely infected guinea pig in the same cage. Prior infection with live virus was fully protective against both homologous and heterologous challenge by direct intranasal inoculation and by exposure to an infected cage-mate. A live-attenuated virus vaccine provided sterilizing immunity against homologous challenge by both routes, but was less effective against heterologous challenge. Finally, the inactivated virus vaccine failed to provide sterilizing immunity against homologous or heterologous challenge by either route. Thus, different vaccine constructs appear to elicit different levels of protection against influenza virus infection, with live-attenuated virus vaccines inducing a protective response that is more similar to natural infection than an inactivated vaccine.",

(2013) studied the protection conferred by different immunoglobulin isotypes against airborne transmission of influenza virus. They passively immunized guinea pigs by intramuscular administration of a neutralizing mouse monoclonal IgG2b antibody directed against the HA protein of A/California/04/2009 [H1N1pdm09] (Cal/09). Although high serum antibody titers were achieved, the immunized animals were not protected from infection by transmission of Cal/09 from inoculated partner animals. In contrast, a single intranasal (IN) administration of this antibody, at a 10,000-fold lower dose, was sufficient to protect immunized guinea pigs from infection by transmission, suggesting that neutralizing antibody at the respiratory mucosa can provide sterilizing immunity against infection by airborne influenza virus. To provide further evidence for this hypothesis, they isotype-switched this antibody by cloning its variable region into the murine IgA heavy chain gene and expressing it with murine \u03ba and J chains. This chimeric IgA antibody was administered intramuscularly to guinea pigs at two doses. The lower dose did not prevent immunized guinea pigs from becoming infected with Cal/09 by transmission, but 7 of 8 guinea pigs immunized with a 5-fold higher dose were protected. Further supporting a role for mucosal immunity in preventing infection by airborne routes, the chimeric IgA antibody was detectible by ELISA only in the nasal washes of guinea pigs immunized with the higher, protective dose. Thus, sufficient quantities of a mucosal neutralizing antibody can prevent infection with airborne influenza virus in the guinea pig model, while serum antibody cannot.",

Multiple weight-based anesthesia regimens can be used, and each institution's veterinary staff will be able to suggest a preferred method. The volume of the virus inoculum used depends on the animal species. Currently, guinea pigs are most often inoculated intranasally with virus suspended in a total volume of 300 \u03bcl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), divided evenly between each nostril (Lowen et al., 2006, Bouvier et al., 2008, Mubareka et al., 2009, Van Hoeven et al., 2009, Sun et al., 2010, Long et al., 2011). However, over the years a range of inoculum volumes \u2013 200 \u03bcl (Wetherbee, 1973, Azoulay-Dupuis et al., 1984), 500 \u03bcl (Phair et al., 1979), and 1 ml (Kwon et al., 2009, Bushnell et al., 2010) \u2013 have been used to infect guinea pigs. There is less consistency among different laboratories regarding the total volume of intranasal inoculation in ferrets: 200 \u03bcl (Matsuoka et al., 2009, Smith et al., 2011b), 300 \u03bcl (van den Brand et al., 2012), 500 \u03bcl (Bodewes et al., 2011, Lakdawala et al., 2011, Herfst et al., 2012, Kroeze et al., 2012), and 1 ml (Herlocher et al., 2001, Duan et al., 2010, Gustin et al., 2011) volumes have been recently reported. Ferrets are also sometimes inoculated intratracheally with a larger volume (3 ml), which appears to enhance disease in this species (Herfst et al., 2012, Kroeze et al., 2012, van den Brand et al., 2012). Additionally, aerosol inoculation \u2013 by inhalation of influenza virus that has been nebulized into an airborne mist \u2013 has been described for ferrets (Lednicky et al., 2010, Tuttle et al., 2010, Gustin et al., 2011) and for guinea pigs (Mubareka et al., 2009). Usually, inoculated animals are kept separate from the susceptible animals for 24 h, to insure that the liquid inoculum dissipates prior to contact with the exposed animals.",

Some laboratories place more than one inoculated animal and/or more than one susceptible animal in the common cage (Herlocher et al., 2004, Duan et al., 2010). In this case, the cage must be large enough to accommodate all animals comfortably. National and international laws and guidelines differ considerably, but, depending on weight, guinea pigs require approximately 200 to 900 cm2 of floor space per animal, with the minimum cage size for a single animal ranging between 387 and 2500 cm2 by 21 to 23 cm high. Ferret cages should be, at minimum, 2250 to 6000 cm2 by 50 cm high, depending on the size of the animal, plus 1500 to 6000 cm2 per each additional ferret (Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986; Animal Research Review Panel, 2006, The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, 2010, National Research Council of the National Academies, 2011, Home Office of the Government of the United Kingdom, 2013).",

Alternatively, one large cage can be divided by an air-permeable wire mesh (Herfst et al., 2012) or perforated Plexiglas (Seibert et al., 2010) barrier, on either side of which inoculated and susceptible animals are housed. Most experimental systems currently in use do not allow the differentiation between droplet spray and short-range aerosol transmission, as both could conceivably occur over the short distances between the animals.",

The speed and directionality of airflow between inoculated and susceptible animals is likely an important variable that is poorly studied and often not controlled in airborne transmission modeling. Similarly, ambient temperature and humidity fluctuates seasonally in temperate climates, even in buildings with environmental control systems, and transmission efficiency may depend on the time of year. Finally, different inoculating doses of virus are often used (Nishiura et al., 2013), which has been shown to impact transmissibility or pathogenicity in ferrets and in guinea pigs (Tang and Chong, 2009, Herfst et al., 2012).",

The isolation of viable influenza virus from the nasal specimen of a susceptible animal exposed to an inoculated animal is indicative of virus transmission between them. Nasal washes are performed by instilling PBS into the nares of an anesthetized animal (1 ml for guinea pigs (Bouvier et al., 2008) and 1\u20132 ml for ferrets (Lednicky et al., 2010, Herfst et al., 2012), divided over both nostrils). In guinea pigs, the PBS is instilled slowly, one nostril at a time, allowing the animal's inhalations to help draw it into the nasal cavity. During the nasal wash procedure, guinea pigs can be held over a sterile Petri dish to allow lavage fluid to drain from the nares by gravity (Bouvier et al., 2008). In ferrets, the PBS is instilled dropwise into the nostril until it induces sneezing, which can be caught in a sterile Petri dish (Lednicky et al., 2010, Herfst et al., 2012). If the ferret does not sneeze, then drainage by gravity can be captured in a Petri dish, similar to the guinea pig procedure (Kroeze et al., 2012). The fluid is then collected from the Petri dish and placed in a centrifuge tube on ice. Nasal and throat swabs can also be collected from ferrets and placed in transport medium, using similar equipment and technique as diagnostic swab collection from humans (Kroeze et al., 2012). However, the nares of guinea pigs are too small for most commercially available swabs. Nasal specimens are centrifuged at low speed for 5 min to pellet nasal epithelial cells or other inhaled debris, and then the supernatant is collected into a clean vial and stored at \u2212 70 to \u2212 80 \u00b0C until titration (Bouvier et al., 2008, Kroeze et al., 2012).",

Like humans, infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses can induce ARDS and multi-organ system dysfunction in ferrets. Mice and guinea pigs are less overtly symptomatic; thus, the use of antivirals or vaccines to prevent or reduce clinical illness is difficult to study in rodent models. Also, the guinea pig has proven to be more resistant to lethal influenza virus infection than humans, and thus appears less useful to model the cytokine storm that results in immune-mediated morbidity and mortality with highly pathogenic strains such as avian-origin H5N1 and H7N9 viruses.",

However, the conveniences of the mouse model \u2013 small size, low cost, ease of handling, and availability of reagents \u2013 make them an ideal initial species in which to perform preliminary pre-clinical studies, such as assessing drug and vaccine efficacy, even though their modeling of human influenza physiology is inexact.",

Thus, to study interventions intended to prevent the spread of influenza viruses among susceptible hosts, the ferret and guinea pig models are most often employed. The rodents do, however, have the benefit of lower cost and less complex husbandry requirements, so that statistically robust data can be obtained at less expense.",
