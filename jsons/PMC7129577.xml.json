At the cathode (negative electrode) sodium hydroxide and hydrogen gas are liberated, whereas at the anode (positive electrode), hydrochloric acid, oxygen, and chlorine gas are produced [8], [9]. The resulting pH change, the anode becomes acidic relative to the basic environment surrounding the cathode, causes a localised parenchymal necrosis [10], [11]. The electric field causes a flux of interstitial water, electro-osmosis, from the anode towards the cathode, since the water molecules act like a dipole. Consequently, the tissue surrounding the anode dehydrates while oedema is obtained around the cathode [9], [12]. Charged substances, dissolved or suspended in tissue, migrate in the electric field and accumulation of ions and charged tissue constituents are obtained at certain and different locations in the electric field. The electric field influences the ion exchange across the cell membranes. Hence, the transmembrane potential is altered and thereby the conditions, e.g. for many essential enzyme-regulated reactions [9], [13]. There is a negligible thermal effect [14].",

In 1983 Professor Nordenstr\u00f6m reported results from the treatment of 26 lung tumours in 20 patients [9]. Many of these patients were, for various reasons, unsuitable for surgical, radiotherapeutic or chemotherapeutic treatment. Regression was obtained in 12 out of 26 tumours and no signs of re-growth were detected after a 2\u20135 year follow-up period. Among the side effects, Nordenstr\u00f6m noticed slight fevers and local pain during the treatment. From the early 1990s until today more than 15 000 patients have been treated with EChT in China [15]. The results have been presented in a number of publications and at several conferences and have been thoroughly reviewed, for example by Nilsson et al. [16]. Despite the vast experiences from China and recent clinical experimental studies in Australia [17] EChT is still not established and obviously endorse the need for further investigation concerning e.g. destructive mechanisms.",

After dewaxing the paraffin sections in xylene and rehydrated in ethanol according to standard procedures, the slides were rinsed and kept in TBS for at least 15 min. The glasses were place in a beaker with 0.01 M citrate buffer pH (6.0), heated to boiling point in a microwave oven and then kept boiling for 10 min. The buffer and tissue sections were cooled down to room temperature during 20 min in cold water. To block endogenous peroxidase activity the sections were incubated with 0.75% H2O2 solved in methanol for 30 min in RT. The sections were rinsed in tap water and subsequently with TBS 2\u00d75 min. To improve antibody penetration the sections were treated with 0.1% protease in TBS for exactly 5 min in RT, followed by careful rinsing with TBS for 15 min. To block unspecific binding the sections were incubated with 5% BSA-TBS for 15 min, then covered with the primary antibody (mouse anti-BrdU, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for 1 h in RT. After careful washing, the secondary antibody (rabbit anti-mouse biotinylated, Dako) was applied to the sections and incubated for 30 min before it was removed with TBS. Thereafter the Avidine\u2013Biotin\u2013Complex /HRP (Dako) was added and rinsed off after 30 min, followed by DAB (diaminobenzidine, Sigma) staining for 7 min. Counterstaining with Hematoxylin (Mayer, Merck) for 5 min was performed according to conventional procedures. Finally, the sections were rinsed in tap water for approximately 10 min. Dehydration and mounting followed standard routines.",

Furthermore, the results in the previous described in vitro study support the hypothesis that low pH induces apoptosis, whereas high pH induce necrosis [19].
