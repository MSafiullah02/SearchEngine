Over 2 days, this panel worked together to develop definitions of rhinosinusitis for clinical research and to suggest clinical trial designs for studies that would allow for more appropriate use of pharmacologic, immunologic, and surgical interventions. Using an anonymous electronic audience response system, the committee was able to reach consensus (\u226580% of committee members) on definitions and clinical research strategies for acute (bacterial) rhinosinusitis, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) without polyps, CRS with polyps, and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS). Diversity of opinion was expressed on whether rhinosinusitis would best be characterized as an infection or an inflammatory condition. Current understanding of the terms infection and inflammation were therefore included in this discussion.",

Histopathologically speaking, the inflammatory component of these disorders manifests as a mixed mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate, with neutrophils predominating in acute disease and eosinophils predominating in most chronic disease. Additionally, there has been an evolution of thought moving away from the notion that all of CRS can be explained on the basis of sinus ostial obstruction and persistent bacterial infection to an appreciation that CRS has a significant inflammatory component that might be caused simultaneously or independently by various factors. Evidence for the varying potential sources of this condition is discussed. These include but are not restricted to the possible roles of:1.persistent infection as a factor in CRS, including biofilms and osteitis1, 2, 3, 4;2.allergy and other disorders of immunity;3.intrinsic factors of the upper airway;4.superantigens from Staphylococcus aureus in CRS with nasal polyps5, 6;5.colonizing fungi that induce and sustain eosinophilic inflammation7, 8, 9; and6.metabolic perturbations, such as aspirin sensitivity.\n",

Important factors in the design of clinical trials are discussed.

This decision was based on the fact that sinusitis is almost always accompanied by concurrent nasal airway inflammation, and, in many cases, sinusitis is preceded by rhinitis symptoms.

The group endorsed and adopted the previously developed definition of the Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership Task Force for Rhinosinusitis: \u201cRhinosinusitis is a group of disorders characterized by inflammation of the mucosa of the nose and the paranasal sinuses.\u201d",

One of the central features in the pathogenesis of infections caused by rhinovirus is that in the nonimmune individual the nasal passages are unable to clear or inactivate the virus. For example, when 343 nonimmune healthy young adults were challenged by dropping rhinovirus in their nose, 321 (95%) of these individuals became infected.24 However, only three quarters of those who became infected had symptoms of illness, reflecting an inapparent infection rate similar to that observed under natural conditions. Initiation of rhinovirus infection is not only an efficient mechanism, but also occurs quite rapidly. After intranasal rhinovirus challenge of susceptible volunteers, newly produced virus was recovered in nasal secretions within 8 to 10 hours.25 This is the same amount of time required for rhinovirus replication in cell culture. Also, in this study symptoms were observed to appear after a relatively short time. Sore throat, nasal obstruction, and rhinorrhea were reported within 8 to 12 hours after virus challenge.",

Sinus CT scans obtained in 31 young adults with early common colds revealed frequent abnormalities in the sinus cavity.26 These abnormalities were observed in the maxillary sinus in 87% of the patients, the ethmoid sinus in 65%, the frontal in 32%, and the sphenoid in 39%. A subset of these patients underwent repeat CT scans 2 weeks later; most of the original changes resolved spontaneously after resolution of the corresponding upper respiratory tract infection. The findings of sinus abnormalities during colds have been confirmed in adults and children.27, 28 The nature of these findings has been debated, but one explanation is the development of thick exudates adhering to the sinus wall with such tenacity that the material is not moved by ciliary action. The epithelium of the sinus cavity contains a high concentration of goblet cells,29, 30 and exocytosis of large amounts of mucin might occur when these cells are stimulated. It is important to determine the nature of the abnormality because this has implications for understanding the pathogenesis of the process and the appropriate approach to its treatment. Whatever its nature, this self-limited process represents a viral rhinosinusitis that is occurring as part of the common cold.",

Sneezing and coughing did not increase intranasal pressures to greater than those observed during quiet respirations. Contrast medium was placed in the pharynx of volunteers who then blew their nose, sneezed, or coughed to further investigate the pressure effects in the nasal passages of nose blowing, after which CT scans of the sinuses were obtained. Contrast medium appeared in one or more sinuses in 4 of the 4 subjects after a nose blow but not after sneezing or coughing (\nFig 4). Calculations revealed that when the middle meatus is filled with viscous fluid, a single nose blow can propel up to 1 mL of this material into the maxillary sinus.

One sinus might have considerable involvement, and another might be perfectly normal.",

In part, this was a result of the frequent need for irrigation of the maxillary sinus to obtain sufficient material for culture. In 6 studies patients were receiving antibiotics up to the time that cultures were obtained. In 2 of the studies, normal nasal flora were the usual organisms recovered (ie, CNS and viridians streptococci). It is difficult to know what pathologic significance to ascribe to CNS.

However, in patients with chronic persistent rhinosinusitis (nasal congestion or nonspecific rhinorrhea or cough, alone or in combination), the role of bacterial agents is less clear. Most organisms have been recovered in low density, and frequently, these were recovered at a time when the patient was receiving antibiotics to which the organisms were susceptible. The lack of quantitation of organisms also complicates interpretation because the middle meatus in children is known to be colonized with the usual sinus pathogens. The persistence of symptoms despite multiple courses of appropriate antimicrobial agents in many children is counter to the notion that bacterial infection is a significant component of CRS. All of these observations support the hypothesis that bacterial infection has a minor role in many children with CRS.",

In the first decade, \u03b2-lactamase\u2013mediated resistance was rare; however, from 1986 through 1991, more than half of 29 strains of H influenzae were \u03b2-lactamase producing.32 There has been no increase in \u03b2-lactamase\u2013positive H influenzae over the last 10 years, and this mechanism of resistance appears to have stabilized at less than 40% of isolates.48, 49 Next in frequency were streptococci other than pneumococci, such as streptococcal \u03b1 and \u03b2 strains, and anaerobic bacterial species. The role of anaerobes in acute community-acquired disease is variable. Although anaerobic bacteria have a more remarkable role in chronic sinus disease, they are not as established in acute sinus disease and account for only 2% to 6% of acute cases, some of which arise from primary dental pathology.",

The importance of a prospective investigation is that there is more assurance that patients are identified and cultures are processed in a standard fashion. CNS was the most common aerobic isolate in 5 of the 7 studies, often accompanied by S aureus and viridians streptococci. The absence of quantitation or performance of Gram stains in almost all studies prohibits an assessment of both the density of organisms and the accompaniment of an inflammatory response. Although CNS is traditionally discounted as a pathogen in both acute rhinosinusitis and CRS, its role as a pathogen in other body sites has been well documented and reviewed by Hsu et al59: neutropenic sepsis, infections of indwelling catheters, and in burn patients. Frequent bacterial recovery from swabs obtained from the middle meatus of healthy subjects suggests that these bacteria are commensals and likely contaminants.64 Nadel et al65 suggested that the difference might be of a quantitative nature. In the unusual situation in which a large number of white blood cells and organisms were present on Gram stains and there was heavy growth of CNS, the possibility of a true infection should be entertained.",

Bacterial biofilms have been elegantly demonstrated in an animal model of otitis media by using scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy.1 The possibility that a bacterial biofilm could be contributing to CRS has not been formally studied. This possibility is theoretically attractive and might help to explain the clinical situation in which patients frequently have negative cultures, improve symptomatically while receiving antibiotics, and relapse when antibiotics are withdrawn. In a biofilm, planktonic bacteria leave the biofilm, cause symptoms, and are susceptible to host defenses and antibiotics. However, the biofilm itself is relatively impervious to antimicrobial agents and is never eradicated. Mechanical debridement appears to be the only mechanism that resolves a biofilm. In some refractory patients this might explain improvement with surgery and irrigation.",

A study by Khalid et al2 using both Pseudomonas species and S aureus in a rabbit study demonstrated similar results. Bone involvement was noted in 92% of the animals on the ipsilateral side to the infection, and in some specimens clear osteonecrosis was identified. Inflammatory bone changes were also noted on the contralateral side in 52% of the animals. The inflammation caused well-defined changes in the bone in rabbits, both adjacent to the infection and at a distance from the primary site of inflammation, which were compatible with a histologic diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis. The inflammatory spread within the bone appears to occur as a result of well-defined changes in the Haversian canals, leading first to widening of the canals and increased vascularity, then to an inflammatory cellular collection within the canals, and later to fibrosis in the involved area.

Allergic fungal mucin is sequestered within involved paranasal sinus cavities, and its accumulation eventually leads to the increasingly well-recognized radiographic findings characteristic of AFRS (\nTable VI). A recent study of sinus CT scans from 45 patients with AFRS objectively supports several previous clinical observations.85 AFRS, although bilateral in 51% of the cases reviewed, caused asymmetric involvement of the paranasal sinuses in 78% of the cases. Bone erosion and extension of disease into adjacent anatomic areas was encountered in 20% of the patients and was more likely to occur in the presence of bilateral advanced disease. Expansion, remodeling, or thinning of involved sinus walls was common (and was thought to be due to the expansile nature of the accumulating mucin). These finding were corroborated by Nussenbaum, et al,86 who reviewed CT scans of 142 patients treated for AFRS at a single institution and also found demineralization of bone in approximately 20% of the subjects.",

In those cases not showing such a correlation, it might be that technical problems in fungal culture or a lack of skin testing reagents might explain the discrepancy. Sensitivity to numerous fungi has been indicated by means of both in vitro (RAST) and in vivo (skin testing) methods, although generally only a single fungus is isolated by means of culture of corresponding allergic fungal mucin. This has been previously thought to be the result of either a common fungal epitope or a genetic predisposition toward fungal allergy in AFRS.

Fungi are recognized for a unique ability to absorb silver. This is the basis for various silver stains, such as Grocott's or Gomori's methamine silver stain, which stain fungi black or dark brown. Unfortunately, silver-based stains have high specificity but low sensitivity. A more sensitive method for identification of fungi has been recently developed that makes use of a fluorescein-labeled chitin-specific binding protein. In a study that compared mucus retrieved from 54 patients with CRS, use of this technique allowed for identification of fungal elements in 100% of specimens, whereas fungi were only detected in 41 (76%) of the 54 specimens by using a Grocott stain.100 Using this technique, Taylor et al100 identified fungal hyphae in the vast majority of sinus mucus samples obtained from patients with CRS, even though most of these patients lacked the other classic features of AFRS. This has become one of the major tenets of the hypothesis associated with the concept of eosinophilic fungal rhinosinusitis (see below).",

The diagnosis might be suspected on the basis of physical examination or radiographic findings; however, in most cases the diagnosis is not established until sinus tissue and mucus obtained during sinus surgery have been reviewed. At the time of surgery, the patient might have a persistently opacified sinus cavity, and eosinophilic mucus plus polypoid tissue might be found to account for this opacification.

By using an ultrasensitive culture technique, 93% of 101 consecutive patients with CRS demonstrated positive fungal cultures from nasal lavage. Examination of surgically obtained specimens from these patients also revealed eosinophils and fungal hyphae in the sinus mucus of nearly all patients. It was also observed that 100% of a group of healthy control subjects had positive fungal cultures from nasal lavage. Conventional IgE-mediated allergy to fungi was not consistently observed in the patients with CRS. It was proposed that virtually all cases of CRS were associated with sensitization to colonizing fungi. It was further suggested that the term allergic fungal rhinosinusitis be replaced with eosinophilic fungal rhinosinusitis.103\n",

This concept was supported by in vitro studies in which PBMCs from patients with CRS were found to produce large quantities of IL-5 and IL-13 after exposure to certain fungal antigens.104 In contrast, PBMCs obtained from healthy control subjects failed to produce the same response. Thus patients with CRS show evidence of sensitization and immune activation in response to colonizing fungi in the nasal and sinus mucus, and this process might be responsible for the production of cytokines that recruit and activate eosinophils in CRS.

Slightly less than half of the patients with CRS and NPs have associated allergies.109 Furthermore, seasonal allergen exposure does not increase symptoms or mediators in the nasal lavage of patients with NPs and ragweed sensitivity.110 However, there is a substantial discordance between skin prick tests and evidence of local IgE antibody levels in polyp homogenates.13 As early as 1982, Drake-Lee and McLaughlin111 reported their finding of IgE antibody in NPs and no difference in local IgE levels in allergic and nonallergic subjects. Recent studies have found IgE in NPs specific for enterotoxins from S aureus, which act as superantigens resulting in a multiclonal stimulation of T and B lymphocytes.13 Another study reported skewing of the V\u03b2 phenotype of T lymphocytes in NPs toward those responsive to staphylococcal exotoxins detected in the tissues.112 It has been repeatedly demonstrated, at least qualitatively speaking, that neither IgE levels nor ECP, IL-4, or IL-5 concentrations in NPs differentiate atopic versus nonatopic subjects, indicating that the phenotype of systemic allergy defined as skin prick test positivity does not correlate with the local features of allergic inflammation in NPs.113 The full explanation for these findings remains elusive, but the implication is that local inflammatory mechanisms might be important in NP pathogenesis. Furthermore, a positive skin test response in a patient with CRS should not be interpreted as an allergic case of CRS. One exception to this rule is AFRS, in which a systemic allergic response to fungi colonizing the sinus mucus is demonstrated in the vast majority of cases (see section \u201cControversy 3: Should CRS be classified on the basis of the proposed definition of eosinophilic fungal rhinosinusitis\u201d).",

SAEs furthermore stimulate T cells by binding to the variable \u03b2 chain of the T-cell receptor, which induce cytokine production of IL-4 and IL-5, directly activate eosinophils and prolong their survival, and also might directly activate epithelial cells to release chemokines.122 SAEs furthermore activate antigen-presenting cells to increase antigen uptake. In fact, when comparing SAE-IgE+ NPs with SAE-IgE\u2212 NPs, the number of IgE+ cells and eosinophils is significantly increased. The more severe inflammation is also reflected by significantly increased levels of IL-5, ECP, and total IgE in the NPs. In conclusion, SAEs are able to induce a more severe eosinophilic inflammation, as well as the synthesis of a multiclonal IgE response with high total IgE concentrations in the tissue, which would suggest that SAEs are at least modifiers of disease in NP.122 Interestingly, similar findings have recently been reported in asthma, which is known to occur concurrently with nasal polyposiss.123 IgE antibody formation to SAE is rarely seen in CRS in the absence of NPs.",

Because the time course of leukocyte invasion is different for specific leukocyte populations, it is necessary to synchronize the day after initiation of infection to follow this time course.

The olfactory mucosa might be particularly susceptible. An example of this type of response is the exposure to complex particulates. Some toxins cause an early and transient neutrophilic inflammation that clears rapidly once the exposure has ended.

They are often dismissed as a functional disorder of nasal complaints without physical findings and lumped together as vasomotor rhinitis (idiopathic rhinitis). This is a misnomer that does no justice to the patient or his or her complaints. Perennial noninfectious, nonallergic rhinitis is an alternative term. There are no clear vascular, motor, or inflammatory cellular patterns. Inquiries about key historical issues can classify and direct therapy to these symptomatic and frustrated patients. These individuals appear to have increased afferent trigeminal nerve sensitivity to inhaled irritants, disordered axon response mechanisms, and potentially altered dorsal horn processing of nociceptive input that contribute to increased perception of these mucosal or visceral stimuli and hence greater complaints of symptoms. An alternative term, irritant rhinitis, describes the syndrome more accurately.128 Patients with irritant rhinitis typically complain of nasal congestion and rhinorrhea in response to weather, temperature and humidity changes, and irritants, such as tobacco smoke,129 gasoline fumes, perfumes and cleaning solutions, beer, and wine. An important function of type C nociceptive neurons is their role in immediate neurogenic responses to noxious stimuli.130 New information about the nature of nociceptive sensors, such as the capsaicin-sensitive ion channel receptor (VR1, recently renamed transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily protein or TRPV1) offers a new understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying responses to irritant gases, fine particulate material, cigarette smoke components, osmolarity, and temperature changes.131\n",

Recent studies examining the histology of middle turbinate tissues from subjects with polypoid versus nonpolypoid disease support the distinction between them. In the study by Malekzadeh et al,164 preoperative sinus CT scans and histologic specimens of middle turbinates obtained during sinus surgery were examined retrospectively in 34 patients and compared with those of 7 control patients who underwent cosmetic and spenopalatine surgery. CT scan severity was classified according to the May classification.165 Tissue sections were stained for mucus cells in glands with Alcian Blue. Goblet cells were often not present because of epithelial metaplasia. The area of tissue sections below the epithelial basement membrane were assessed by means of digitized image analysis, and the percentage area stained blue was determined (\nFig 7). Normal (May class 0) and mild (May class I) sinusitis showed approximately 6% mucous cells in nasal airway mucosa. A similar percentage was found in class II. However, these subjects could be divided into those with relatively normal histology and those who showed cobblestoned mucosa or small polyps during surgery. This was accompanied by suggestions of increased mucosal edema. As shown by Biedlingmaier and Trifillis,126 these subjects have goblet cell metaplasia with a decrease in ciliated cells. A major difference in mucosal histology was seen in class III. One population of subjects showed thickened mucosa on visual inspection and had glandular mucous cell hyperplasia, with 22% of the mucosa stained with Alcian Blue. This indicates that some mechanism was active to cause glandular hyperplasia. Potential mechanisms could be similar to those suggested for chronic bronchitis and murine models showing IL-13\u2013induced goblet cell hyperplasia. The other population of patients had visual evidence of polyposis. The histology from the patients with polyps showed a decrease in percentage Alcian Blue area as disease severity worsened from class II to class IV (pansinusitis). Ultimately, the polypoid degeneration totally obliterated normal mucosal histology in the region of the polyp root. Patients with polypoid disease were also more likely to manifest changes of pansinusitis on sinus CT. These results strongly suggest that distinct molecular mechanisms underly the polypoid and glandular hypertrophy subsets of CRS.",

In class I and II these cells are replaced by goblet cells. In class III microvillous cells are the predominant population. Squamous metaplasia is present in class IV. Erythrocytes and patches of denuded epithelium are also seen. This suggests a mechanism for invasion of microbes through the usually protective lining. In essence, the nasal and sinus mucosa differentiates into a skin-like squamous epithelium. These epithelial changes offer novel ecologic niches for microbial colonization and invasion. This might explain the differences in bacterial organisms cultured from acute rhinosinusitis (presumably ciliated epithelium) versus CRS (microvillous to squamous epithelium) groups. These epithelial changes are amenable to treatment and might improve with intensive therapy after surgery.169\n",

            "text": "The mucosal lining in patients with CRSsNP is characterized by basement membrane thickening, goblet cell hyperplasia, limited subepithelial edema, prominent fibrosis, and mononuclear cell infiltration. Histomorphologic characterization of NP tissue (CRSwNP) reveals frequent epithelial damage, a thickened basement membrane, and mostly edematous to sometimes fibrotic stromal tissue, with a reduced number of vessels and glands but virtually no neuronal structures.174, 175, 176 The stroma of mature polyps is mainly characterized by its edematous nature and consists of supporting fibroblasts and infiltrating inflammatory cells localized around empty pseudocyst formations. In small polyps, not larger than 5 mm, growing on normal-looking mucosa of the middle turbinate in patients with bilateral polyposis, early processes of polyp growth have been studied.177 Numerous subepithelial EG2+ eosinophils were present in the luminal compartment of the early-stage polyp, forming a cap over the central pseudocyst area. Fibronectin deposition was noticed around the eosinophils in the luminal compartment of the early-stage polyp and formed a network-like structure in the polyp center and within the pseudocysts. The presence of myofibroblasts was limited to the central pseudocyst area. Interestingly, albumin and probably other plasma proteins were deposited within the pseudocysts adjacent to the eosinophil infiltration. These observations suggest a central deposition of plasma proteins, regulated by the subepithelial eosinophilic inflammation, as a pathogenic principle of polyp formation and growth. The extravasated plasma, for reasons of distance, binding force, or extracellular matrix damage or abnormality, might not find its way to the airway surface.178\n",

            "text": "Mast cells are known to play a key role in IgE-mediated diseases but are also involved in non\u2013IgE-mediated inflammatory diseases. Mast cells can be detected in both the epithelium and the stroma of NPs, as also seen in the nasal mucosa of patients with allergic rhinitis. By contrast to that in the allergic nasal mucosa, the majority of degranulated mast cells are localized to the deep stroma, suggesting that mast cells in NPs are not likely to be activated by inhalant allergens. These mast cells express a variety of cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-13, GM-CSF, TNF-\u03b2, and IL-8, and mast cell mediators, such as histamine and tryptase. IL-4 and IL-13 are capable of upregulating the release of RANTES, GM-CSF, stem cell factor, and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine from NP epithelial cells, fibroblasts, or both, indicating a vicious cycle perpetuating the eosinophilic inflammation. In fact, it was recently observed that there are increased levels of tryptase and ECP in recurrent NPs compared with levels found in fresh untreated NPs.190 Also, a good correlation was detected between the levels of ECP and tryptase. These findings are further supported by the observations of Di Lorenzo et al198 that the levels of tryptase and ECP in nasal lavage samples of patients with NPs correlated with symptom scores. Furthermore, histamine from mast cells can upregulate the production of fibronectin and chymase, and tryptase can upregulate the production of MMP-9.190 Because mast cells can be stimulated in a variety of ways other than conventional allergy, (eg, bacteria, virus, fungi, complement, or autoantibodies), mast cells might contribute to the induction of eosinophilic inflammation through the release of various inflammatory mediators and indirectly through the activation of structural cells, thus contributing to the formation and progression of NPs.",

            "text": "On the basis of the pathologic features of CRSwNP and a limited number of investigations, it is possible to consider 4 processes that might contribute to the inflammatory process: (A) late-phase allergic inflammation in response to airborne allergens (in allergic subjects with CRSwNP); (B) T-cell activation with production of IL-5, IL-13, and IFN-\u03b3 in response to fungal antigens (hyphae) in sinus mucus; (C) T-cell activation, cytokine production, and local IgE production in response to bacterial superantigens; and (D) dysregulation of sinus epithelium with overproduction of chemokines, such as RANTES.A.In allergic subjects with CRSwNP, the presence of the complete TH2 profile of cytokines suggests that late-phase allergic inflammation might contribute to the disease. However, on the basis of studies of Adkins et al,209 it is doubtful that airborne allergens penetrate into sinus cavities. This leaves open the question as to how the late-phase inflammatory process is driven in the sinuses. The answer might lie in systemic cross-talk of allergic inflammation (ie, the ability of allergen-induced inflammation at one site to induce a similar response at a remote site). This type of interaction has been demonstrated between the nose and the lungs,210, 211, 212 and preliminary studies suggest that a similar interaction might occur between the nose and the sinuses.213 Increased levels of IgE receptor (Fc\u03b5RI) expression were detected in NPs from atopic subjects, and the functional relevance of this could be to cause an increase in IgE-dependent histamine release from NP mast cells.183, 190 In these patients the levels of specific IgE have been found to be higher in the NP tissue compared with that found in the serum of the same patients, indicating local IgE synthesis.190 Because IgE itself can upregulate Fc\u03b5RI expression in mast cells, this can lead to a chronic activation of mast cells and the recurrence of NPs with eosinophilic inflammation.B.Studies of antigen-specific immune responses in CRSwNP are very preliminary, but evidence suggests that peripheral blood T lymphocytes from patients with CRS proliferate and produce IL-5, IL-13, and IFN-\u03b3 in response to fungal antigens, particularly those from the dematacious fungi Alternaria and Candida species (see section \u201cNon\u2013IgE-mediated eosinophilic fungal inflammation\u201d).104 This cytokine profile matches that found in NP tissues or T lymphocytes isolated from NP, therefore supporting the concept that this might be an important immune response pattern in CRSwNP. However, this response profile is not specific for fungi and can also be seen in response to superantigens.214\nC.Bacterial infection might also be associated with IgE sensitization and increase in bacteria-specific IgE and a shift to a TH2-type cytokine profile.215 In fact, Bachert et al13 detected specific IgE to staphylococcal enterotoxins A and B in NPs and found that the levels of IgE correlated with the eosinophilic infiltration. They demonstrated multiclonal IgE, including specific IgE to staphylococcal enterotoxin A and staphylococcal enterotoxin B in 50% of bilateral eosinophilic NPs. Similar levels of superantigen-specific IgE were found in atopic and nonatopic subjects, suggesting a potential common inflammatory response in these 2 groups. Most of these subjects also had asthma. Because IgE can upregulate mast cell Fc\u03b5RI expression and mast cell activation, these observations further suggest a role for mast cells in regulating the chronic eosinophilic inflammation.D.Holtzman et al216 described a mechanism of T-cell transmigration through the epithelium that involves ICAM-1 and the C-C chemokine RANTES. They proposed that the epithelium in asthma is \u201cconstitutively dysregulated\u201d (ie, expressing ICAM-1 and producing RANTES independent of exogenous stimuli). This dysregulation does not appear to be associated with increased nuclear factor \u03baB activation in the airway epithelium. The functional consequence of these actions is to facilitate T-lymphocyte migration through the epithelial compartment. They further showed that this dysregulation involves overactivity of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and does not require the presence of IFN-\u03b3.217 Given the many similar inflammatory features of asthma and CRSwNP, it is possible that a similar type of dysregulation is present in CRSwNP.\n",

Furthermore, an imbalance of MMPs with an upregulation of MMP-7 and MMP-9 in CRSwNP has been found, whereas in CRSsNP MMP-9 and TIMP-1, a natural antagonist, are increased.218 This results in the enhancement of MMP-9 in CRSwNP, whereas in CRSsNP MMP-9 activity is inhibited.219 Differences in TGF-\u03b21 and metalloproteinase levels might account for edema formation with albumin retention in CRSwNP versus fibrosis in CRSsNP.",

This might be the case, for instance, in a drug study in which the putative action of the drug might be to prevent the recurrence of NPs.

Eosinophilic diseases limited predominantly to the nasal cavity are worth mentioning because of their strong association and potential overlap with rhinosinusitis. These include allergic rhinitis, nonallergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome, and blood eosinophilia with nonallergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome. Obviously, the finding of nasal and sinus eosinophilia is the common element that groups these very diverse and distinct pathogenic syndromes into a single classification that can then be further delineated by other findings, such as the presence of atopy, mucosal edema (polyposis), and fungal hyphae.",

This hypothesis was based on the finding of fungal hyphae in association with degranulating eosinophils in the sinus mucus of 93% of patients with CRS, regardless of the presence or absence of allergy, NPs, or other classic features of AFRS. The authors proposed that eosinophilic fungal rhinosinusitis accounts for the vast majority of cases of CRS. Their proposal has stimulated a great deal of controversy. One contentious issue pertains to the prevalence of finding fungal hyphae in sinus mucus and what level of hyphae would be considered abnormal. Using greatly refined mucus collection and staining methods, Ponikau et al8 found fungal hyphae in the mucus of nearly all patients with CRS. Confirmatory results were recently published from Graz, Austria, by using similar methods of mucus handling and histologic staining for fungal hyphae.223\n",

The Ponikau et al proposal to redefine CRS as AFRS seems to dismiss the importance of defining a small subset of cases as AFRS. However, the consensus opinion expressed at the conference was that the term classic AFRS should be retained as the name for the condition classically described as having distinct immunologic, allergic, clinical, and histologic features (see previous discussion of these features). If the Ponikau hypothesis is ultimately widely accepted, the subgroup of patients with classic AFRS are still likely to represent a distinct clinical subset based on these distinctive features.224\n",

Important distinguishing features in the scheme are (1) the presence or absence of NPs; (2) the presence or absence of eosinophilic or other inflammatory features; and (3) the presence or absence of fungal hyphae in sinus mucus. The role of bacterial infection as a causative factor in CRS remains controversial, but bacterial infection is regarded as a potentially important factor in both CRSsNP and CRSwNP. Similarly, other underlying or predisposing factors to the disease, such as mucus recirculation, humoral immune deficiency, abnormal mucociliary function, and allergic rhinitis, are extremely important and are listed. Anatomic abnormalities have anecdotally been listed as a predisposing factor for rhinosinusitis, but existing studies do not support this role. An important question arising from the classification scheme is how strongly are certain factors, such as bacterial infection, associated with either CRSsNP or CRSwNP. At present, it is not possible to provide definitive answers to this question. Precise classification of a patient in terms of inflammatory features, namely as having eosinophilic or other inflammatory features, requires evaluation of sinus tissue and sinus mucus.

Many causes of headaches are manifest in the anterior face. These include tension, migraine, cluster, and rebound headaches and tempromandibular joint dysfunction. Eye diseases and problems with accommodation can also cause periorbital pain. Tension headache is the most common type of headache. It can be described as tightness over the head and neck. It is not aggravated by physical activity, and the typical presenting symptoms of migraine are absent. Patients with tension headaches often believe they have rhinosinusitis because their pain is localized in the forehead and relief is obtained from over-the-counter sinus medications. Migraine headache is an idiopathic recurring disorder with attacks that last approximately 4 to 72 hours. Characteristic of migraine are unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate-to-severe intensity, associated nausea, and phonophobia or photophobia.231 Some of the distinctive features of migraine with aura are the complex neurologic symptoms that develop before the onset of the acute headache.

This will help define the magnitude of a patient's disease and allow for more refined assessments of interventions.

The most common symptom scoring range in clinical trials of upper respiratory diseases has 4 options: 0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; and 3, severe.227 A 6-point Likert scale would range as follows: 0, none-absent; 1, very mild; 2, mild; 3, moderate; 4, severe; and 5, very severe. This scale has been used to identify which symptoms are typically the most problematic for patients with CRS (\nTable XI).230 Another scoring system option is a visual analogue scale that ranges from 0 (no symptoms) to 100 (maximum severity). The Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (representing the AAAAI; the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology; and the Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology) has developed a method for assessing severity of symptoms of allergic rhinitis. It includes an assessment of nasal symptom severity, an assessment of nonnasal symptom severity, a global assessment of nasal and nonnasal symptom severity, an assessment of QOL issues related to allergic rhinitis, and the effectiveness and adverse profile of current and past rhinitis medications.232 This method for severity assessment of allergic rhinitis symptoms still requires internal and external validation. Nonetheless, it appears to have potential for both assessing patient management and facilitating clinical research. In addition, by using this method as a guideline, a variation of it can be suggested and could be adapted for evaluating rhinosinusitis. Although patients might characterize the severity of rhinosinusitis as mild, moderate, or severe on the basis of one dominating symptom, there is often a mixed degree of severity of the individual symptoms that comprise the full clinical picture.",

Measuring it recognizes the effects of the disease, which might not otherwise be reported by patients or considered by clinicians. A scale similar to that used for symptom severity assessment can be used (\nTable XIV). A visual analog scale can also be used to assess the effect of current and past therapy (including over-the-counter and prescription medications, complementary and alternative treatments, and surgical procedures) for a patient's rhinosinusitis (\nTable XV). Failure of a medication used consistently should be contrasted with failure of one that was compromised by poor adherence to a regimen. The duration of treatment and both the benefits and adverse effects should be quantified.",

This quantitative definition increases the probability that organisms recovered from the maxillary sinus aspirate truly represent in situ infection and not contamination. In fact, most sinus aspirates from infected sinuses are associated with colony counts in excess of 104 cfu/mL. If quantitative cultures cannot be performed, Gram staining of aspirated specimens affords semiquantitative data. If bacteria are readily apparent on a Gram stain, the approximate bacterial density is 105 cfu/mL. Of 12 cases in which an antral puncture showed at least 105 cfu/mL pathogens, the Gram stain demonstrated either organisms or white blood cells in all 12 and organisms and white blood cells in 9 of 12.264 The Gram stain is especially helpful if bacteria are seen on smear and the specimen fails to grow with standard aerobic culture techniques, in which case anaerobic organisms or other fastidious bacteria, such as a bacterial biofilm or an antibiotic-suppressed infection, should be suspected. Performance of a Gram stain will also permit an assessment of the local inflammatory response. The presence of many white blood cells in association with a positive bacterial culture in high density makes it likely that a bacterial infection is present. A Gram stain does not easily differentiate neutrophils from eosinophils, and therefore an eosinophil-rich smear with bacteria would be interpreted as showing many white blood cells by many laboratories. Alternatively, a paucity or absence of white blood cells in association with the presence of a positive culture in low density suggests that the bacteria are contaminating the culture rather than causing infection.",

Several studies in adults have shown a good correlation between cultures of the middle meatus and the sinus aspirate in patients with acute sinusitis, especially when purulence is seen in the middle meatus164, 264, 270; however, other studies have not.271, 272 CNS is usually interpreted as a nonpathogen in acute sinusitis. Talbot et al264 correlated the results of endoscopically obtained cultures and cultures obtained from maxillary sinus aspirates. They reported no situations in which the puncture demonstrated CNS of greater than 105 cfu/mL; however, a swab of the middle meatus grew CNS in 6 of 53 patients. Interpretation of the pathogenicity of S aureus is more difficult. Two of 53 patients had greater than 105 cfu/mL, which correlated with the endoscopic swab. However, in an additional 6 patients, there was no agreement between sites.264\n",

A major drawback is its inability to subgrade the volume of inflammatory disease in grade I, which can represent any degree of sinus involvement from greater than 0% to less than 100%. When evaluating a specific medical therapeutic agent, if grade 1 disease with 10% sinus involvement is cured, it is reduced to grade 0. However, if grade I disease with 90% involvement is reduced to 30%, a substantial improvement, the classification is still grade 1, suggesting there has been no change. Furthermore, this staging system does not take into account the patency of the ostiomeatal channels. These issues can be easily addressed by further stratifying grade 1 into 1A (1% to 33%), 1B (34% to 66%), and 1C (67% to 99%) and by noting the patency of the tight spots (ie, the frontal recess, middle meatus, infundibulum, and sphenoethmoid recess).

They first performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial in 20 healthy nonallergic subjects to assess nasal versus sinus responsiveness to histamine. Subjects were treated with loratadine or placebo for 7 days and then underwent a nasal challenge with histamine. Twenty-four hours later, while receiving the medication, a catheter was placed in the sinus cavity, and the subjects underwent a sinus challenge with histamine. Not surprisingly, in patients receiving placebo, nasal challenge with histamine led to increasing vascular leak indicated by increasing levels of albumin in nasal lavage specimens. When treated with loratadine, an H1 antihistamine, the effect of histamine challenge was blocked. Although a similar effect was noted in the sinus challenge, the sinus mucosa was 10 times less sensitive to histamine compared with the nasal mucosa. A contralateral response, indicative of a nasonasal reflex, was also evaluated. Although the nasal challenge produced a significant reflex, no effect was noted with sinus challenges. This study showed the feasibility of challenging a sinus directly and suggested differences between the response of the sinus and nasal mucosa to the same stimulus.",

This resulted in 41 positive nasal responses (in 29 patients), as measured by using rhinometry. Interestingly, 32 of the 41 challenges showed an increase in mucosal edema or opacification of the maxillary sinuses on plain radiographs. They concluded that there was a role of nasal allergy in some patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis. In another study, Baroody et al213 evaluated the effect of antigen challenge in the nose on inflammation within the sinus. Using a Sinojet (Atos Medical, distributed by Bivona Medical Technologies, Gary, Ind), an instrument used to obtain sinus lavage fluid from the maxillary sinus, they found that nasal allergen challenge induced an eosinophilic sinus mucosal response that was not seen with control challenge. In another study subjects were challenged to assess the effects of nasal allergen challenge on the ipsilateral versus the contralateral sinus. Although eosinophils were present on both sides, the number of eosinophils was significantly less on the contralateral side.290 A significant increase in maxillary sinus eosinophils was also found during the allergy season compared with that seen in patients out of season, confirming the findings of the nasal challenge studies.291 Overall, these results suggest that sinus inflammation occurs after nasal allergen challenge.",

However, as discussed earlier, Gwaltney et al31 performed a different study in which sinus CT scans were obtained after instillation of radiopaque contrast material into the nasopharynx. The contrast material entered the sinus in 4 of 4 patients after nose blowing, although not after sneezing or coughing.

The lower airways of individuals who only have allergic rhinitis have been repeatedly found to be inflamed or even remodeled (increased thickness of the reticular basement membrane) compared with those of healthy control subjects.294 Also, lower airway hyperresponsiveness can be detected in a significant number of individuals with allergic rhinitis but without lower airway symptoms.295\n",

A nasal allergic reaction induced by localized provocation, for example, can result in increased responsiveness in the lower airways310, 311 or even in late reductions in lung function.312 Inversely, treatment of allergic rhinitis with topical glucosteroids has been shown, in several studies, to improve various asthma outcomes.313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321 However, the mechanisms of this apparent interaction between the nasal and the lower airways are not clear. Obviously, many functions of the nose are known to benefit the lower airways, and it would not be surprising if deterioration or improvement of these functions accounted for the interactions. On the other hand, allergic reactions and their inflammatory consequences appear to propagate systemically, and the interactions between nasal and lower airways might represent the manifestations of such a systemic component.210, 211, 212\n",

Evidence of eosinophilia in the sinus mucosa is stronger in patients with rhinosinusitis and asthma, as opposed to rhinosinusitis alone.323 Medical and surgical treatment of sinus disease appears to have beneficial effects on asthma outcomes, but the studies reporting such findings are not randomized, and the outcomes are frequently subjective.324, 325, 326 Thus because the links between the upper and lower airway are not fully understood, additional, careful, mechanistic, and therapeutic studies need to be conducted to further clarify the relationships of rhinosinusitis in these integrated respiratory syndromes.",

For example, studies designed to demonstrate the efficacy of novel antibiotics frequently study subjects with acute symptoms combined with the presence of fluid in the maxillary sinuses as demonstrated on the basis of air-fluid levels on plain radiography or CT scanning. Given regulatory guidelines by which this class of drug is approved, this definition is understandable. However, many patients present with a similar spectrum of acute symptoms and are treated on an empiric basis without confirmatory imaging tests.160, 161, 162, 328, 329 On review of published clinical trials, it is clear that even for the acute maxillary paradigm listed above, inclusion and exclusion criteria are inconsistent in regard to the demographics of the populations studied, the medications prohibited during any study, and the range of concomitant medications permitted.",

There are certain clear situations in which a placebo group would be unethical (eg, for an acute, severe bacterial infection for which antibiotic treatment is indicated). In this case a standard antibiotic is generally appropriately used as a positive control. In other cases of suspected acute bacterial sinusitis, a placebo-controlled trial might be reasonable if appropriate rescue measures are included to protect the patients in the trial. Discontinuation of patients from such a trial could be a valid efficacy outcome variable. In addition, some clinical trials have demonstrated that antibiotics are not effective for rhinosinusitis. In such cases, a placebo control group might be ethical. Also, when adjunctive or prophylactic agents are being evaluated, it is often possible to design an appropriate placebo-controlled study.",

If patients are refractory to therapy or if their symptoms are atypical, a detailed physical examination is generally indicated. In some cases referral to a specialist, with performance of radiographic imaging, flexible or rigid nasal endoscopy, or both, might be appropriate.344 As experience has evolved with the use of coronal CT imaging of the sinuses, it is now accepted that appropriate timing of a CT scan is crucial. Gwaltney et al26 showed that positive scans could be demonstrated in acute upper respiratory tract infection. For CRS, a scan taken to demonstrate the extent of residual disease after maximal pharmacotherapy, to define anatomy before surgery, or both is appropriate.162 There have been several attempts to devise staging systems to define the extent of disease.345 Most of these have been developed as a guide to surgical staging and have not been validated in the context of assessing the natural history of the disease or in assessing the effect of nonsurgical intervention.",

Researchers developing a clinical trial design need to set diagnostic parameters so that the patients who can provide the most meaningful clinical results can be included. In patients with rhinosinusitis, this might mean distinguishing between viral and bacterial disease, as well as acute rhinosinusitis and CRS. Most trials for acute rhinosinusitis will likely be carried out in a primary care office setting, where sophisticated diagnostic techniques, such as CT and MRI, might not be readily available. For the purposes of research, patients with symptoms lasting less than 10 days should not be included in trials on presumed bacterial infections because symptoms that resolve before 10 days are usually indicative of viral rhinosinusitis. Symptoms that should be evaluated include purulent drainage, nasal congestion, facial pain, and headache. Even if these criteria are applied, consideration must be given to the high rate of spontaneous resolution (approximately 50%) in the population with acute (presumed bacterial) rhinosinusitis.343 Therefore, unless a sample size is large enough to effectively power the study, the results might fail to demonstrate drug efficacy.",

For a stand-alone antibiotic drug, the study needs to show that the experimental antimicrobial agent is similar or superior to an approved antibiotic, as well as showing some evidence of bacteriological cure (www.fda.cder/guidance: Acute Bacterial Sinusitis). For acute bacterial rhinosinusitis studies, clinical outcomes are measured by clinical cure or clinical failure, for example, a 20% difference between an antibiotic and placebo as an outcome at the end of 10 days of therapy. Microbiologic outcomes are described as documented eradication, presumed eradication, documented persistence, or presumed persistence. During a recurrent rhinosinusitis study, efficacy variables can include time to recurrence (possibly primary variable), severity of recurrence (secondary variable), and frequency of recurrence (secondary variable). Finally, it is important to determine that end points used to assess efficacy should be carefully selected to avoid confounding factors.

It is important to maintain the distinction between rhinosinusitis and rhinitis both diagnostically and therapeutically, even though the conditions might have overlapping symptoms and signs.
