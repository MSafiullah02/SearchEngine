            "text": "The Seattle Flu Study is a multi-arm surveillance platform established in November 2018 to develop a community-based early detection system for influenza and other respiratory viruses. 1 Individuals were recruited into the study through online advertising and social media. Participants in the prospective community surveillance arm were eligible to participate if they were a resident within the greater Seattle metropolitan area (Supplemental Figure 1) , self-reported new or worsening symptoms of acute respiratory illness (ARI) and were able to provide informed consent, or if a minor, had a legal guardian who could provide this. Eligible ARI symptoms included two of the following: feeling feverish, headache, sore throat or itchy/scratchy throat, nausea or vomiting, rhinorrhea, fatigue, myalgia, dyspnea, diarrhea, ear pain or ear discharge, rash, or a new or worsening acute cough alone. After signing an electronic consent form, all participants completed an electronic questionnaire to ascertain demographic, clinical, and behavioral characteristics using REDCap electronic data capture hosted at University of Washington. 2 Online community enrollment occurred as part of two studies. As part of the \"Swab-and-Send\" study, individuals meeting eligibility criteria enrolled online through the study website (seattleflu.org) within seven days of symptom onset. 3 As part of a household study of respiratory illness in families with children, participants enrolled online in longitudinal household studies before illness onset, and underwent weekly symptom monitoring as prompted by text message or e-mail reminders. 4 When they met criteria for ARI, they self-collected (or had a parent or guardian collect) a mid-nasal swab based on instructions provided in the kit that was mailed to the participant's home (Supplemental Figure 2 ). For participants enrolled in \"Swab-and-Send\" in the Seattle area, kits were mailed using FedEx Same Day City 2-hour delivery services, and returned via 2-day mail (Supplemental Table 1 ). For participants in the household study, the kits were delivered to the household at enrollment, and swabs were collected at the time of illness. Table 2 ). 5 Because the CDC assay is low throughput, requiring 4 separate RT-PCR assays in individual wells of a 96-well plate, we developed a research assay using one SARS-CoV-2 probe set multiplexed with an RNase P, a human cellular marker, with a different fluor. Using this research assay 190 samples were tested in duplicate, in a single 384-well plate with no-template and positive template controls. The RNase ",

Smoking status was defined as the use of cigarettes, cigars, and pipes or electronic cigarettes/vapor pens.

Other underlying chronic conditions included diabetes and cardiac disease. Chronic conditions were ascertained via selfreport. Interference with daily activities was self-reported on a 5-point scale, with 1 representing no interference and 5 representing significant interference. A medical visit was defined as having sought care from a healthcare provider at a clinic, urgent care center, hospital, or emergency department prior to study enrollment for the participant's current respiratory illness. We generated descriptive statistics for all variables. Proportion of missing data are reported and percentages are computed based on non-missing results. Statistical comparisons between groups were determined using Fisher's exact tests, and Wilcoxon-rank-sum tests, as appropriate. Linear regression was used to test for time trends. Two-tailed tests were used for all comparisons and statistical significance was defined as p<0.05. Home residential addresses were converted to GPS coordinates, which were then assigned to Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) to be mapped at an aggregated level.",

In particular, online recruitment may have led to under-recruitment of the very young and elderly as compared to the county's population. However, widespread asymptomatic carriage of SARS-CoV-2 in children does not appear to be common overall, at least early in this pandemic. 6 An additional limitation is the use of a collection method that has not been previously utilized for detection of SARS-CoV-2.",

SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed using real-time RT-PCR with a SARS-CoV-2 probe set targeting Orf1b with FAM fluor (Life Technologies 4332079 assay # APGZJKF or the Centers for Disease Control N1 probe set from Integrated DNA Technologies) and RNaseP probe set with VIC fluor (Life Technologies A30064) on a QuantStudio 6 or Viia7 instrument (Applied Biosystems). We added a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) on March 19 which included another assay targeting the SARS-CoV-2 S gene ((Life Technologies 4332079 assay # APXGVC4), also performed in duplicate and multiplexed with RNase P-VIC. Three or four replicates for RNase P and SARS-CoV-2 must have cycle threshold (Ct) < 39 for a sample to be considered positive in the LDT or both replicates must be positive for the research assay. For assay validation, we first evaluated cross-reactivity among 270 samples collected prior to December 2019 that tested positive for other common respiratory viruses (human coronaviruses HCoV HKU1, NL63,OC43, 2293; influenza A/B, RSV A/B, rhinovirus, enterovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1-4, human metapneumovirus, and adenovirus). No samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using this assay. Additionally, to account for the shipping time between sample collection and testing, we evaluated the stability of detection of SARS-CoV-2 from mid-nasal swabs collected according to the above methods. Samples were incubated for stability studies for a total of 9 days and analyzed at days 3, 5, 7, and 9 at 4\u2103, 20\u2103 (room temperature in Seattle, WA, USA), and 28\u2103 (average high temperature in Seattle in the summer) (SupplementalFigure 3).Assay performance was concordant with a maximum coefficient of variation of 3% for SARS-CoV-2 Ct values over all time and temperatures evaluated.",
