Incidence of acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) is high [1], [2]. Moreover, emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia and other countries poses a new public health challenge [3]. In order to reduce the risk of ARI among Hajj pilgrims, the Saudi Arabian health authority recommends a range of infection control measures [4], however, compliance to these measures is highly variable [5], [6], [7], [8]. Several studies have addressed pilgrim knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) towards preventive measures and infectious diseases, finding that their understanding about the potential severity of respiratory infection and the need for protective measures was inadequate [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. Gautret et al. [9] found that <50% of French pilgrims were aware of social distancing, available treatment options, and facemask use as precautionary measures against the spread of respiratory infections. Other studies assessed pilgrim knowledge of emerging infections, such as MERS-CoV and Ebola, and found that 60% of pilgrims were not aware of MERS-CoV circulation in Arabia and about 40% had no accurate knowledge of Ebola transmission. However, longitudinal studies examining these questions before, during, and after travel are lacking.",

Several studies have demonstrated their usefulness in conveying health messages in a variety of contexts and audiences, with high response and retention rates and fewer data-entry errors during descriptive studies and randomised controlled trials [14], [15]. Thus, smartphones may provide better platforms to conduct prospective surveys among Hajj pilgrims than conventional \u201cpen and paper\u201d-based methods [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. Additional advantages include constant internet connection, location-detection services, and user proximity making it an ideal tool for collecting infectious disease data during mass gatherings. Data concerning smartphone usefulness in infectious disease research at mass gatherings are very limited [19]. Therefore, we conducted a pilot study using a smartphone app to examine its feasibility to track not only Hajj pilgrim KAP regarding preventive measures, but also symptom onset and participation in high-risk activities before, during, and after Hajj 2014.",
