We have assessed the antiviral drugs Anaferon for Children (AC) and Ergoferon (containing AC as one of the active pharmaceutical ingredients) in in vitro and in vivo experimental models, in order to evaluate their anti-rhinoviral and immunomodulatory potential. HeLa cells were pretreated with AC, and levels of the interferon-stimulated gene (ISG), 2 0 -5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1-A) and viral replication were analyzed. In a mouse model of RV-induced exacerbation of allergic airway inflammation we administered Ergoferon and analyzed its effect on type I (IFN-b), type II (IFN-g) and type III (IFN-l) IFNs induction, cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), cytokine (interleukin (IL)-4; IL-6) and chemokine (CXCL10/IP-10; CXCL1/KC) levels. It was shown that AC increased OAS1-\u0410 production and significantly decreased viral replication in vitro. Increased IFNs expression together with reduced neutrophils/lymphocytes recruitment and correlated IL-4/IL-6 declination was demonstrated for Ergoferon in vivo. However, there was no effect on examined chemokines. We conclude that AC and Ergoferon possess effects against RV infection and may have potential as novel therapies against RV-induced exacerbations of asthma.",

These changes lead to functional activity regulation, production of endogenous IFNs, hence affecting the antiviral defense. Consequently, OAS1A induction demonstrated in the experiments corresponds to the AC mechanism of action and coincides with the literature, where an increased production of ISGs is connected to the augmentation of IFN induction. Most likely that AC augments other than OAS1A genes that are also important in the anti-viral response. In fact, there are over 380 characterized ISGs (Der et al., 1998) , some of which are also induced by IFN-g. Unfortunately, it was beyond the scope of the present study to measure other ISGs, stressing in this respect the necessity for conducting additional studies to address the mechanism of the observed anti-RV effect. AC, being a monocomponent drug (contains as API only technologically-treated Abs to IFN-g) was used in the initial experiments, to see whether we could demonstrate antiviral activity against RV in vitro, where only innate responses can be induced. Having observed encouraging results we then opted to use Eroferon, which is in addition to technologically-treated Abs to IFN-g, also contains Abs to CD4-receptor and Abs to histamine, in order to show whether we could in addition observe immunomodulatory/ anti-inflammatory effects in a more complex in vivo environment where both innate and acquired immune responses, as well as inflammatory and Th2 responses can be studied. It was previously shown that Ergoferon could influence on various elements of host antiviral protection systems, inducing endogenous IFNs, CD4 (Emelyanova et al., 2016) and histamine receptors (Zhavbert et al., 2014) , generally expressed by macrophages, dendritic cells, and Tcells (both Th1 and Th2) .",

To sum it up, the decrease in both cell attraction and cytokine expression noticed for Ergoferon at 48 h p.i., could be an advantageous mechanism which is lead to attenuation of airway inflammation (Zhu et al., 1996) . However, further studies will be needed to clarify the effect of Ergoferon on these and other cytokine and cellular responses to RV infection in asthma.",

Probably, huICAM 14C11 reduced RVinduced allergic airway inflammation after 24 h p.i. For instance, Traub and colleagues showed significant reduction in BAL cell profiles with huICAM 14C11 at the same doses (100 mg/mice) only at 48 h p.i., while there were no measurements at the earlier timepoints (Traub et al., 2013) . Taking together, observed results of the study demonstrate an antiviral effect for AC in vitro and beneficial responses with Ergoferon in vivo. AC treatment showed an evident induction in OAS1A expression together with reduction in viral replication. Ergoferon in its turn present an increase in IFN production and reduction in cell and cytokine profiles in vivo.",
