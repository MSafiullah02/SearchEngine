It had been purchased at 4 months of age with another 4-month-old male ferret. Both were surgically sterilized, born in The Netherlands, and vaccinated against rabies. The young male died at the age of 6.5 months and was diagnosed through a postmortem examination with ferret systemic coronaviral disease. The young female had a history of multiple illnesses post purchase, including coccidiosis, giardiasis, nematodiasis, chronic cough, and mesenteric lymphadenopathy. A serologic test for Aleutian disease (Quickcheck ADV; Avecon Diagnostics, Bath, PA USA), performed when the animal was 7 months of age, was negative. The cough started at the time of purchase and improved only after treatment that included corticosteroid, antibiotic, and bronchodilator therapy. According to the owner, this ferret had a poor appetite and was never healthy compared with the rest of the colony.",

The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. A lateral thoracic radiograph taken without the use of anesthesia or sedation revealed retraction of lung borders from the spine and diaphragm, pleural effusion, enlarged heart silhouette, and areas of pulmonary consolidation (Fig 1). The ferret was placed in an oxygen cage for stabilization before further diagnostic tests were performed. After 10 minutes, a plane of light anesthesia was induced with isoflurane in combination with oxygen to facilitate diagnostic sample collection. Blood was collected from the jugular vein and submitted for a complete blood count and plasma chemistry panel. Thoracocentesis was performed, and 1.5 mL of serosanguinous fluid was collected. The ferret recovered uneventfully and was subsequently treated with furosemide (2 mg/kg, intramuscular, Furosemida 20 mg/2 mL solution injectable; CDM Lavoisier, Paris, France) and amoxicillin/clavulanate (15 mg/kg, subcutaneous, Clamoxyl injectable; Pfizer Animal Health, Madrid, Spain). The animal remained in an oxygenated critical care unit overnight.",

Protein electrophoresis showed increased globulins (6.5 g/dL; reference range, 2.2-3.2 g/dL), with \u03b3-globulins representing 41.4% of total proteins and an albumin:globulin ratio of 0.23 (reference range, 1.0-1.6). Microscopic analysis of the thoracic fluid revealed mainly erythrocytes; total protein 3.8 g/dL and protein electrophoresis showed the same pattern obtained for serum proteins (\u03b3-globulins represented 42.3% of total proteins). Based on clinical signs, hypergammaglobulinemia, and history, a preliminary diagnosis of ferret systemic coronaviral disease was made and the ferret was discharged on a treatment protocol of amoxicillin/clavulanate (15 mg/kg, orally, twice a day), furosemide (2 mg/kg, orally, twice a day, Seguril comprimidos; Aventis Pharma, Madrid, Spain), and prednisolone (2 mg/kg, orally, twice a day, Estilsona gotas; Sonphar SL, Barcelona, Spain).

The progression of the lipid pneumonia may have led to pathologic changes in the lung tissue that increased the intrapleural negative pressure, thereby producing fluid accumulation due to an increase in the hydrostatic pressure gradient.18 In addition, those pulmonary changes may have induced cardiac enlargement and insufficiency, contributing to the pleural effusion. Pathologic changes in the heart associated with lipid pneumonia have been described in humans.19 In this case, lipid pneumonia was believed to be the major cause of respiratory failure. Although pleural effusion was noted, it has been reported in dogs and cats that 30 to 60 mL/kg of pleural effusion are required to produce respiratory compromise in the absence of parenchymal disease.20 In the present case, less than 8 mL/kg of fluid were recovered from the thoracic cavity at necropsy. Furthermore, dyspnea did not improve immediately after thoracocentesis or after increasing doses of furosemide.",
