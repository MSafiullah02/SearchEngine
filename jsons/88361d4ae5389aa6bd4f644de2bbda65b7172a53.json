In humans, the virus causes respiratory tract infections which are mild but may be lethal in some cases. Coronaviruses are a group of an RNAvirus and also known as a 2019-nCov virus. Coronaviruses are viruses in the subfamily Orthocoronaviridae, of family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales. Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses and have a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome with a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry [8, 31] . The genomic size of coronavirus varies from 26 to 32 kilobase [7] . Coronaviruses are categorized into four genera i.e. alpha, beta, delta and gamma, where alpha and beta are responsible for causing infection in humans [17] . There are seven strains of human coronaviruses Viz. Human coronavirus 229E(HCoV-229E), Human coronavirus OC43(HCoV-OC43), SARS-CoV, Human coronavirus NL63(HCoV-NL63, New Heaven Coronavirus), Human Coronavirus HKU, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) previously known as novel coronavirus 2012 and HCoV-EMC, Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) also known as Wuhan pneumonia or Wuhan coronavirus. The coronaviruses HCoV-229E, -NL63, -OC43 and -HKU1 frequently circulate in human population and cause respiratory infection in adults and children. The incubation period for human coronavirus is 2-5 days [15] . As it is communicable disease and transfer from one person to another person through a droplet and direct contact [9] . The recent identification of fourth human coronavirus, HCoV-NL63 was diagnosed from a 7-month-old child who suffers from bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis. Symptoms of coronavirus are feeling tired, difficulty in breathing, fever, coughing and sore throat. As the symptoms are similar to other respiratory diseases including flu and common cold.

The populations of certain places, which are disease-ridden with MERS infection are suspectable for Molecular test and clinical tests to identify active infections of MERS-CoV [22] . To identify the viral RNA within reckonable samples, a molecular test called Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) are vividly used. For identification and confirmation of MERS-CoV infection entails, as per Central for disease control and prevention (CDC) there must be either a positive rRT-PCR result for at least two definite genomic targets or single positive target with the sequencing of a second target. As per CDC the United States has approved an rRT-PCR assay for MERS-CoV. The test is thru under the buff of an Emergency Use Authorization. But human error, poor laboratory conditions and ignorance while testing the samples is such prevalent factors which could affect the capability and proficiency of rRT-PCR test. For this rRT-PCR assay, CDC recommended collecting multiple samples, including lower and upper respiratory sample, serum and stool specimen. CDC considers a patient under examination to be negative for active MERS-CoV infection when one negative rRT-PCR test on the mentioned specimen.

These types of antibody have the capability to attack, attenuate, kill the hosted virus within the immune system. The presence of antibodies to MERS-CoV shows that a person had been formerly diseased with the virus and develops an immune response. Confirmation to date recommends there may be a wider range of MERS disease than was initially thought. For example, a public health investigator has recognized individuals who are PCR-positive but have no MERS symptoms; we do not know if MERS-CoV can be spread by these people. CDC has a two-phase methodology for serology testing, using two screening tests and one confirmatory test to distinguish antibodies to MERS-CoV [6] . The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a screening tests to detect the occurrence and concentration of specific antibodies that is bind to a viral protein. CDC recommended ELISA test for antibodies against two different MERS-CoV proteins viz. nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S). To identify the neutralizing antibodies, the microneutralization assay is a good confirmatory test which helps to measure specific antibodies in serum specimens. However, compared to ELISA, the microneutralization assay is a laboratory intensive and time-consuming method and requires at least 5 days before the result are available. If a clinical sample is found to be positive either by ELISA or microneutralization, the specimen is determined to be confirmed positive [5] . If a clinical sample is found to be positive by both ELISAs, and negative by microneutralization, the sample is determined to be intermediate. If a clinical sample is found to be positive by only one ELISA and negative by microneutralization, the sample is determined to be negative [18] . In the end, a final determination of a confirmed positive serology the result needs to be a positive ELISA test and confirmation by microneutralization assay.

The existence of an infectious agent was demonstrated by inoculating the medium form these cultures in human volunteers. In this experiment, colds were produced but the growth of agents does not occur. At the same time other two scientists, Hamre and Procknow got to succeed in growing virus with unusual properties in tissue culture from samples which were picked up from adults with colds. Hamre named this virus as 229E (Hamre's virus) [12] . In the late 1960s, Tyrell with a group of scientists worked on human strains and other animal viruses which included infectious bronchitis virus, mouse hepatitis virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine which were morphologically the same as seen through electron microscopy [12] . This new category of viruses was called coronavirus and was accepted as new genus of viruses. Further research gives more information about the epidemiology of human respiratory coronaviruses like it was found that in temperate climates, respiratory coronavirus infections occur more often in the winter and spring [29] . After three decades of discovery, human strains OC43 and 229E were studied. Like many other viruses the reinfection was common. As the research continues to explore the pathogenicity and epidemiology of the human coronavirus, the importance and number of animal coronaviruses were growing rapidly. In 2003, the new virus SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus) was identified which first infected humans in Southern China. SARS-CoV killed 774 people and at least 8000 people were infected [23] . SARS infection affected 29 countries. Since 2004, there have not been any known cases in the world [16] . The transmission of SARS is primarily from person to person. Symptoms are like influenzalike and include fever, malaise, headache, diarrhea, and shivering. The evolution of this virus demonstrated that this virus is not stable virus and can adapt to become more virulent, even lethal, to humans. After that another outbreak in Saudi Arabia in 2012 cause many deaths and later spread to other countries. It was called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV) as its origin was Middle East. The spread of infection occurred worldwide; however, most cases of deaths occurred in the Middle East.

The Chloroquine has been most prominently active against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The Chloroquine has significant impact on establishing endolysosomal pathway, as SARS-CoV-1 virus try to vandalize this pathway, hence Chloroquine could be very effective against novel corona virus. A recent paper stated that both chloroquine and antiviral Remdesivir inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and proposed that these drugs to be assessed in human patients suffering from COVID-19. As far as its mechanism of action is concern against novel corona virus, it has multiple mechanisms in which in stepby-step it inhibits the pre entry of virus penetration within the cellular surface receptors. The Chloroquine was found to have inhibitory effects against enzyme called quinone reductase 2; a structural neighbor of UDP-N -acetylglucosamine 2-epimerases, which is involved in the biosynthesis of sialic acids. The Chloroquinoline, interferes the biosynthesis of sialic acid, by which human coronavirus HCoV-O43 and the orthomyxoviruses cannot utilize sialic acid moieties as receptor, due to which the virial glycosylation on virus cell surface receptor would stop. Due to alkylation of endosome, Chloroquine shows in-vitro antiviral effect when added to Vero cells prior to virus exposure. The mechanism is likely to be rapid annulment of virus endosome fusion with fluctuation of endosomal pH through endocytosis. Based on the initial studies and positive outcomes of Chloroquine, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on March 24, 2020 suggested that, those patients who are corona positive and the doctors and other healthcare professionals who are handling COVID-19 patients are advised to take Hydroxychloroquine; a Chloroquinoline derivative, as a preventive drug.

Haseltine, March 25, 2020) Hydroxychloroquine has ineffective treatment of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The small controlled trails were conducted in Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, China with 15 patients by giving 400 mg hydroxychloroquine dose for 7 days. The results are not that much surprising, when the treatment group was compared with the controlled group after CT scans, it was observed that treatment group has less significance difference than the controlled group.
