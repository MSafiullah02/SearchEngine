The effect of annual hospital lobectomy volumes on outcomes was examined by modeling yearly hospital volume by IHM and LOS, adjusting for calendar year, gender, age, Charlson comorbidity index (each score analyzed separately), province of care (using Ontario as the reference province), and the average volume per hospital over the study period.

Accounting for case-mix and comorbidity is required in volume\u2013outcome relationship investigations, but we were limited to the use of the Charlson comorbidity index, which has been validated for population-based studies and used elsewhere in volume\u2013outcome research. Its use, however, of comorbid illnesses, such as congestive heart failure, diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus, renal failure, and cancer, does not include all accepted factors that increase the risk of pulmonary resection. Other important markers, such as forced expiratory volume in 1 second, carbon monoxide diffusion in the lung, and exercise testing, are not available in the Canadian Institute for Health Information database and are not part of the Charlson index. In our study, IHM and LOS did not change uniformly with progressive Charlson comorbidity scores as would be expected. This could be explained by the expected worse outcomes in patients undergoing anatomic lung resection for inflammatory reasons, many of whom would have a correspondingly lower Charlson score. As such, each score was analyzed separately and not linearly to account for this effect. Furthermore, although the Charlson index accounts for malignancy, we do not have stage information in our database, which limits our ability to control for patients with more advanced disease, although arguably this should not affect short-term outcome in well-selected patients.",

Because the results were consistent across the study period, however, this is likely not a significant factor. The Charlson comorbidity index is formed from ICD coding, but it has been shown that the change in coding did not affect its performance in capturing comorbidity.20, 21, 22\n",

Our results support the cross-sectional relationship between short-term outcomes and higher-volume centers. In addition, we show that, over time, there has been an improvement in short-term mortality, and this change is in part due to more cases being done in higher-volume centers rather than within-hospital improvement. These results support the idea that services should continue to be regionalized to high-volume centers. However, regionalization is clearly more than just volume and includes other processes of care that we have not measured, such as specialized services, staff, and experience. This study suggests that systematic initiatives in regionalization of thoracic surgery are moving us forward in improving outcomes of patients undergoing lobectomy.
