The presence of fever as a diagnostic criterion for influenza-like illnesses has resulted in the widespread use of fever screening systems for rapid identification of potential cases for public health management.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 As a substantial proportion of affected cases during SARS and the 2009 influenza pandemic had fever as their main symptom,7 screening systems may identify some of the more severe cases that have a higher propensity for transmission.",

Despite the widespread use of ITDS (e.g., at hospitals and airports), the initial experience of such systems during SARS suggested a low efficacy.2, 8, 9, 10, 11 Since then, there have been further reports on mass screening of fever, with conflicting results.8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 To date, there are few clinical studies evaluating the various fever screening systems available, or the reliability of self-reported history of fever. As ITDS systems detect a difference between the subject and the ambient temperature, the deployment of these systems is more challenging in hot climates, either in tropical or subtropical regions where year round transmission of respiratory pathogens occurs, or in temperate countries during emerging outbreaks in summer months. This study, conducted in Singapore, evaluates the accuracy of three different ITDS for fever detection compared with traditional oral thermometry and self-reporting in a clinical setting.",

The STE ITDS was the first thermal imager based system in the world designed for mass human temperature screening, developed and deployed during the SARS outbreak of 2003.20 The basic setup consists of a mounted thermal imager which uses a Thermal Reference Source (TRS) as a reference to display the temperature profile of the subject. Temperature is represented as an illustration of different colours on a real-time monitor, each of which corresponds to a particular temperature, and the user interprets a febrile subject based on the hot spots on the subject's skin surface (see Fig. 1\nA). The Omnisense Sentry MKIII is similar in setup to the STE IFSS, and has been marketed as a new generation ITDS with real-time calibration to ambient temperature with a claimed 0.1 \u00b0C accuracy. It also has a video capture device that is digitally synchronized to the thermal image, with a dual video display which sets off an automated alarm and visual auto-tracking of the target once a febrile subject enters the screening area (see Fig. 1B). It is in widespread use in various commercial buildings and hospitals locally. The Quick Shot Infrared Thermoscope is a handheld thermal scanner which displays the estimated core body temperature after it is directed a few centimetres from a subject's forehead, and is also widely used in the Singapore military, primary healthcare settings and childcare centres due to its portability and non-intrusiveness.",

However, it is a commonly utilized method for fever screening, and is what our military uses on a routine basis, and hence was preferred as the gold standard for this study over tympanometry, which is the preferred gold standard in other settings but which is documented to be less accurate than oral thermometry.26 The study population, being military servicemen, was predominantly of a young male demographic, and therefore not reflective of the entire population. This may impact the study findings; for example, the elderly may have a lower core temperature during infection, due to an attenuated inflammatory response, and therefore the sensitivity in diagnosing infections of all the screening measures considered may be lower in the population as a whole. Additionally, this study has an under-representation of females, in whom pregnancy, menstruation or hormonal treatments may cause variation in the external skin temperature, thereby influencing our results.13 This evaluation was only conducted in one healthcare centre over one month. A multicentre study conducted over a longer time period would be useful to assess if the findings could be generalized to a pandemic situation which may be substantially longer than one month, and where fever screening would be utilized in various settings including border control and airports. However, given the lack of seasonality in equatorial Singapore, the weather during the month in which the study was performed is very similar to that throughout the rest of the year, the monsoon season excepting, and therefore we anticipate that the duration of the study will not limit the generality of our findings.",
