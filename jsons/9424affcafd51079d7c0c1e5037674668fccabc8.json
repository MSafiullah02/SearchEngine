Immunoglobulin substitution therapy along with prophylactic antibiotics remained the cornerstone of treatment for PADs and related complications [2] . Generally, immunoglobulin replacement therapy can effectively reduce both incidence and severity of infections [2] . However, immunoglobulin products contain only purified IgG antibodies and lack other antibody isotypes. It is thus expected that pulmonary infections may persist and even flourish under regular immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Thereby, the patient will be more predisposed to chronic lung diseases and related severe sequels such as respiratory failure [3] . Recent studies have identified a gap for screening protocols to monitor respiratory manifestations in patients with PADs [4] .",

            "text": "Among the most severe types of PADs is X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), the first PID described by Ogden Bruton in 1952. XLA is the most common monogenic immunodeficiency [5] resulting from mutations on the X chromosome in the gene encoding a tyrosine kinase, the so-called Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk). These mutations are of loss-of-function type, making an arrest in the early stages of B-cell development [5] . XLA is therefore a humoral immunodeficiency characterized by depletion of B-cells and low levels of all immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE) [6] . While the number of T-cells and NK cells varies within normal range, it is however realized that lack of B-cells might lower the optimal function of T-cells, as reflected in the diminished T-cell memory to specific antigens. For example, patients with XLA show a defect in T-cell memory to N. meningitidis but not influenza [7] . The presentation of this antibody immunodeficiency is expected to occur (a) earlier than other types of PADs, (b) after maternal antibodies waned, and (c) during the first 2 years of life with recurrent and severe sinopulmonary infections [8] [9] [10] [11] . However, there are reports, for example, from China, where the mean age at diagnosis was more than 6 years. Even, there have been reports of late-onset XLA (up to the fourth decade of life) [12] . Overall, the mean age at diagnosis falls within the range 3.2-7.7 years, whereas the mean age at onset of symptoms happens within the range 1.8-4.2 years [13-17, 10, 18] . This reflects the delay in diagnosis ranging from 1.4 to 3.6 years.",

While BTK deficiency can leave the body in a state of immunodeficiency (e.g., XLA), its upregulation may lead to autoimmune states, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus [19] , as well as malignant states, notably B-cell malignancies [23] , squamous cell carcinoma, and pancreatic cancer [24] . Hundreds of variants have been identified in the gene BTK from patients with XLA [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] 18] which may explain phenotypic divergence in XLA [30] . Therefore, data are integrated to investigate genotype-phenotype interactions [31] . Overall, the most common complications of XLA are pulmonary infections and bronchiectasis.",

            "text": "Pneumonia is the most common acute infection associated with XLA [14] . Recurrent pneumonia should be, therefore, regarded as an alarm sign for PIDs including XLA [34, 35] . Before the diagnosis is made, between 60% and 83% of patients with XLA have a history of at least one episode of pneumonia [36] , and approximately 30% of patients have a history of hospitalization due to pneumonia [16] . With an adequate immunoglobulin therapy, the rate of pneumonias is reduced by more than 10% [14] and lies within the range of 0.00-0.10 pneumonias per treatment year [13, 37] . However, approximately 50% of patients might experience deterioration in their respiratory status while receiving immunoglobulin therapy [38] . The rate of infectious episodes during immunoglobulin therapy seems to be agerelated, since there is a threefold increased risk for infections in adult patients compared with pediatric patients (2.12 vs. 0.74 infections/patient/year) [38] . More important is that pneumonias after initiation of immunoglobulin therapy might be severe as many as half of episodes might require hospitalization for intravenous antibiotic treatment [13] . In multivariate analysis, patients with bronchiectasis had a > 3-fold increased risk of pneumonia during the 5-year immunoglobulin therapy [14] . Its source remained unknown in almost 80% of cases. However, sputum cultures could reveal the following as bacterial pathogens underlying pneumonia in patients with XLA: Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycoplasma pneumonia [13, 33] . Analysis of bron-choalveolar lavage (BAL) in patients with XLA without acute pulmonary function identified bacterial pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae and Veillonella [39] . Also, bacteria that were observed through protected specimen brush samples included Haemophilus influenzae, \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci, and Porphyromonas [39] . Other bacterial pathogens found in association with pneumonia among patients with XLA are Pseudomonas species and M. tuberculosis [16] . Looking at chest X-ray, pneumonia in patients with XLA can cause peribronchial thickening and then segmental atelectasis [13] . Antigen-specific immunological responses might predict the risk of respiratory tract infections in patients with XLA. More precisely, individuals who developed IgG and IgM responses specific to bacteriophage phi-X 174 were less likely to be affected by respiratory tract infections (RTI) compared with those who developed only IgM responses [22] . Although very rare, there are reports of pulmonary infections with fungal (aspergillosis and Pneumocystis jiroveci) [40] and viral pathogens (respiratory syncytial virus) [41] [42] [43] in patients with XLA even despite regular immunoglobulin substitution therapy. Chronic sinusitis seems to predispose individuals with XLA to pulmonary aspergillosis [40] .",

These include a reduction in forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) as well as a reduction in forced expiratory flow (FEF) [13] . Pulmonary function abnormalities appear not to be age-related [13] . The delay in diagnosis has shown an inverse association with the risk of chronic lung disease. Supporting this, lung function decreases with aging in patients with XLA and is worsened by smoking and bronchiectasis. A longitudinal study of patients with XLA (n = 8) over an average period of 7.6 years calculated an average annual decline of 65 \u00b1 11 mL/year and 58 \u00b1 20 mL/year for FEV1 and FVC, respectively [15] .

The prevalence of bronchiectasis increases with age [14] and that turning 18 years old was the most important factor predictive of bronchiectasis [33] . However, other factors associated with an increased risk of bronchiectasis included a history of pneumonia and treatment with IVIG compared with subcutaneous IG [33] . In addition, patients with chronic sinusitis were four times more likely to have bronchiectasis [14] . It is important that almost half of patients with XLA suffer from chronic sinusitis [14] , whereas no effect of IgG levels on the risk of bronchiectasis was found [14] . The age range for development of bronchiectasis was 7-45 years [33] . Regardless of age, bronchiectasis lowers lung function as reflected in reduced FEV1 [33] . Bronchiectasis is, therefore, the real cause of diminished life quality among patients with XLA [38] . CXR findings are often evident in the middle and lower lobes of the lung(s) [11] . HRCT appears to be more sensitive than CXR for evaluation of pulmonary abnormalities in patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia including XLA [46] .",

Upon stimulation, Fc\u03b3RIIa is recruited from intracellular compartments to the cell surface. Fc\u03b3RIIa recruitment is accompanied with activation of Btk, which in turn induces the expression of adaptor molecule MyD88. In this manner, Btk act to direct cross talk between Fc\u03b3RIIa and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) [49] . It is followed by engagement of MyD88 adapter-like (Mal)/TIRAP interaction which plays a crucial role in TLR-dependent NF-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) proinflammatory responses [50] . Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) mainly MMP9 induced by NF-\u03baB contribute to tissue remodeling in acute lung injury. As expected, Btk inhibitors could abrogate the expression of both Btk and MyD88 in human neutrophils activated with anti-IL-8/IL-8 immune complexes [48] . Additionally, treatments blocking either Btk or MMP9 diminished the expression of MMP9 in neutrophils from mice exposed to secondhand smoke [51] . Altogether, it is plausible to think of Btk-targeted neutrophil-specific therapy in conditions associated with acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [48] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [51] . Ibrutinib is used in targeted therapy of malignancies and autoimmune diseases to inhibit BTK. It has been shown to prevent influenza-induced acute lung injury through reduction of pro-inflammatory mediators [52] . Btk inhibitor RN983 showed much more anti-inflammatory potency than corticosteroid budesonide in mouse lung in form of inhalation [53] . This makes it effective in the treatment of allergic asthma. RNA interference (RNAi) of Btk has been demonstrated to decrease protein levels of Btk and phosphorylated Btk (p-Btk) and diminish the expression and activation of Btk in alveolar macrophages [54] . In a mouse model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis, pretreatment with Btk RNAi was able to prevent epithelial cell apoptosis, pulmonary edema, vascular permeability, the expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6) and signaling (NF-\u03baB), and neutrophil lung infiltration.",

Also, transmembrane protein Ig\u03b1 in association with Ig\u03b2 serves as the signal transduction component for the pre-BCR complex. Abnormalities in pre-BCR structure and function hinder the transition from pro-B-to pre-B-cell stage [68] , predisposing individuals to immunodeficiency, malignancy, and autoimmunity (for review see [69] ). Yel et al. 1996 [70] were the first group to identify mutations in the IGHM gene as a cause of agammaglobulinemia. They reported seven patients from two families with AR B-cell defects. Patients presented between 1 and 15 months of age. Clinical manifestations included fever, weakness, rashes, chronic enteroviral encephalitis, recurrent infections (pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, and otitis), failure to thrive, gastrointestinal disorders, septic shock (due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa), arthritis, and perirectal abscesses.",

Also, it is concluded that patients carrying mutant IGHM experience an earlier onset and more difficult course of agammaglobulinemia compared to patients carrying mutant BTK [71] .

            "text": "Studies of mice have shown that the transcription factor 3 (TCF3) gene plays a crucial role in B-cell development [90] [91] [92] . This gene which is also known as E22 gene encodes transcription factors E12 and E47. Mutations in TCF3 have been reported in both autosomal recessive [93] and autosomal dominant [94] agammaglobulinemia. The authors in [93] described a patient with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) presented with profound hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent pneumonia, meningitis, pancytopenia, and splenomegaly. His immunological findings included less than 1 percent normal number of CD19+ B-cells in the periphery in the presence of normal counts of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T-cells. Boisson et al. 2013 [94] identified the same de novo mutation in the TCF3 gene (within the exon that encodes E47) in four patients with an unusual phenotype characterized by almost complete absence of BCR in the presence of increased expression of CD19 on B-cells [95] . All patients presented severe hypogammaglobulinemia and less than 3 percent CD19+ cells in the periphery. Age at diagnosis ranged from 9 months to 4 years. Clinical presentations included pneumococcal meningitis, recurrent otitis, vaccine-associated polio, and arthritis. Other clinical findings were dermatitis and hepatomegaly. Sawada et al. 2003 [96] are the first group that isolated the leucine-rich repeatcontaining 8 (LRRC8) and showed that B-cell development is impaired in mouse model for a truncated expression of LRRC8. They also provided a report describing a girl patient with agammaglobulinemia, absence of B-cells, epicanthic folds, mild hypertelorism, high-arched palate, and lowered ears. The patient carried mutant LRRC8. To our knowledge, no other report of mutant LRRC8 in association with agammaglobulinemia has been published.",

            "text": "Good's syndrome (GS) or thymoma with immunodeficiency refers to the combined conditions of thymoma and immunodeficiency. It is mainly characterized by thymoma, hypogammaglobulinemia, and low number of B-cells in the periphery. However, low number of T-cells and an inverted CD4/CD8 ratio are also common. Tarr et al. 2001 [97] in the study provided a report of 5 patients with GS presented with infection as well as a review of 46 other patients with GS and infections. Infections have a propensity to affect the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract [98, 99] . The following are infectious complications documented in GS: recurrent sinopulmonary infection, CMV disease, bacteremia, oral or esophageal candidiasis, persistent mucocutaneous candidiasis, chronic diarrhea, urinary tract infections, P. carinii pneumonia, tuberculosis, Kaposi sarcoma, disseminated varicella, candidemia, wound infection with Clostridium perfringens, Mycoplasma arthritis, etc. However, the main clinical findings at presentation appear to be sinopulmonary infections with encapsulated bacteria. When compared to patients with CVID, patients with GS experience a more difficult course of immunodeficiency complicated with opportunistic infections such as P. carinii pneumonia, mycobacterium tuberculosis, and mucocutaneous candidiasis, resembling that which occurs in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [100] . Therefore, if a patient with thymoma or CVID develops refractory infections, then we should consider GS as a differential diagnosis. Particularly, persistent infection (pneumonia) following thymectomy might warrant that your patient is very likely to have GS [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] . Overall, respiratory manifestations in association with GS include recurrent sinopulmonary infections (sinusitis, rhinosinusitis, otitis media, and pneumonia) [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] with bacterial (especially with encapsulated bacteria including Haemophilus influenzae), fungal (aspergillus and P. carinii), and viral (CMV and HSV) pathogens [115] [116] [117] [118] [119] [120] [121] , tracheobronchitis [118] , diffuse panbronchiolitis [122] [123] [124] , granulomatous lung disease [125] , and pulmonary nodules [123] . As for patients with other forms of agammaglobulinemia, patients with GS remain dependent on immunoglobulin replacement therapy. A recent study has estimated the median survival of 14 years for 47 patients with GS [111] .",

Both types are characterized with similar immunological findings including low levels of IgG2 and lymphocytes and high levels of IgM and B-cells [127] . Overall, patients with APDS are prone to recurrent respiratory infections, airway disease [127] , lymphoproliferation, cytopenias, skin diseases, chronic EBV and CMV viremia, and enteropathy [126] . All these major manifestations tend to decrease over time [126] . Of notable importance is that respiratory infections are the most frequent, initial manifestations of APDS [126] .",

Looking at CT scans, evidences of bronchiectasis were found in 60% of patients with APDS1 and 27% of patients with APDS2. Mean age at diagnosis of bronchiectasis was 11.2 years. Therapeutic options available to patients with APDS include antibiotics, antifungal agents, immunoglobulin replacement therapy, systemic immunosuppressive therapy, and HSCT [126] . Particularly a cohort study of 36 patients with APDS2 revealed that recurrent upper respiratory tract infections were experienced by all patients [128] .

            "text": "PI3K as lipid kinases play role to maintain normal function of airway. Abnormal PI3K signaling can alter airway function, so that inflammatory responses are aggravated [129] . Such a condition is seen in patients with respiratory diseases especially allergic inflammation and asthma. Airway biopsies from 11 patients with atopic asthma provide evidence of increased activation of the PI3K signaling after exposure to allergen [130] . PI3K-\u03b4 is a class I PI3K isoform proven to particularly contribute to both innate and adaptive immune responses [129] . Such contribution is resulted from its interaction with Akt, together triggering the PI3K-\u03b4/Akt signaling pathway. Increased activation of this signaling pathway is thought to mediate airway inflammation as seen in obstructive lung diseases [131, 132] and induced by cigarette smoking [133] . Moreover, PI3K-\u03b4 is able to reduce glucocorticoid sensitivity of airways ( [131, 132] . This explains why some patients are resistant to glucocorticoids. Supporting this, PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitor can mitigate allergic inflammation in asthma models [134] . The effect remained true upon exposure to Aspergillus fumigatus. At least part of this anti-inflammatory effect of PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitor appears to be mediated through reducing endoplasmic reticulum stress [135] , hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), and nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, and pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) expression in lung tissue [136, 134] . All these factors are involved in generating inflammatory responses upon stimulation [136] . Additionally, PI3K-\u03b4 contributes to virus escape possibly by increasing the expression of B7-H1 (PD-L1) [137] . Therefore, it is well-expected that APDS, a condition associated with PI3K-\u03b4 upregulation, should be accompanied with bacterial and viral infections as well as different respiratory manifestations.",

Animal models of asthma demonstrate that PI3K-\u03b4 blockade hampers infiltration of inflammatory cells by decreasing vascular permeability [141] . Moreover, PI3K-\u03b4 inhibition can help to regain glucocorticoid sensitivity and, therefore, enhance anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids [131, 132, 142] . However, attention should be paid that oversuppression of this pathway might cause toxicities. As for APDS, PI3K-\u03b4 function is abnormally high in malignant states particularly B-cell malignancies [143] . As a result, PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitor (idelalisib) can be used to treat these malignancies [144] . However, it might reduce cellular respiration and so be toxic to lung tissues [145] .",

It is mainly characterized by a defective B-cell differentiation resulting in hypogammaglobulinemia of IgA, IgG, and IgM with two or more standard deviations below the normal mean. Also, about half of patients manifest characteristics of malfunctioning T-cells and cytokine/chemokine system including a reduction in CD40 ligand expression and IL-2 production [174] . Therefore, CVID covers a spectrum of disease phenotypes, and the diagnosis should only be made after ruling out other potential causes of hypogammaglobulinemia including other PIDs and immunodeficiency diseases due to infectious agents, malignancies, protein-losing agents, and drugs [175] . CVID involves a complex interaction of different disease processes. However, there are a few monogenetic forms of CVID that are caused by defect in a single gene such as ICOS [176, 177] , TACI [178, 179] , and CD19 [155] . Clinical presentations mainly include recurrent bacterial infections especially affecting upper and lower respiratory tracts, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune disorders, lymphoproliferative disorders, chronic lung diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, malabsorption, hepatitis, and malignancies (especially lymphomas). Clinical symptoms usually peak in the second or third decade of life. Early-onset disease is, however, common, especially in male patients [180] . Recently a multicenter study of 2212 patients with CVID has reported that the median diagnostic delay is around 4-5 years in most populations [181] . Overall, as much as all patients with CVID experience infectious respiratory diseases [182] [183] [184] and more than half of patients develop noninfectious respiratory complications as well [185] .",

In order they were found in about 69%, 63%, and 58% of patients. Lower respiratory tract infections are also found in 84% of patients [182] . In particular, pneumonia is experienced by about 32-77% of patients [180, 182, 184, 186] . Early-onset CVID in male (before 10 years of age) patients is considered a discrete disease entity characterized by a higher risk of infectious complications including pneumonia, but not noninfectious complications [180] . Encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae are the main pathogens associated with respiratory tract infections in patients with CVID. In particular, Bordetella pertussis may contribute to the development of respiratory disease in children with CVID. About 13% of patients reveal a severe defect in switched memory B-cells (IgD-CD27+ cell percentage \u22642% of B-cells), which is related to an increased need for antibiotic therapy. Follow-up studies indicate that the incidence of acute pneumonia and otitis will decrease by time [186] .

GLILD in CVID has been associated with a higher prevalence of HHV8 infection, leading to an increased risk of lymphoproliferative disorders [193] .

As reviewed by [201] , anti-CD20 treatments predispose patients to severe and refractory respiratory infections with bacteria, fungi, and viruses, while, anti-CD20 antibodies are being increasingly used to treat autoimmune diseases and non-Hodgkin lymphoma [202] . This has been parallel by increasing the number of cases of pneumocystis pneumonia [203] . This increased susceptibility might be due to suppressive effect of anti-CD20 antibodies on type 2 helper T (Th2) responses, e.g., production of cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13 [202] . Moreover, there is a report of antisynthetase syndrome after treatment with rituximab, a CD20 monoclonal antibody [204] . The patient was presented with recurrent respiratory infections, arthropathy, and interstitial pneumonitis. Immunoglobulin replacement therapy was shown to improve immunodeficiency and pneumonitis. It is also interesting that treatment with 25-OH vitamin D3 has been shown to enhance CD20 levels [205] .",

            "text": "The inducible T-cell co-stimulator (ICOS) is shown to stimulate differentiation of T follicular helper (TFH) cells and development of Treg, Th17, and Th2 cells that can promote autoimmunity and local inflammation [207] . In this manner, myeloid cells (CD11+ cells) expressing this co-stimulator can contribute to the generation of inflammatory processes in lung tissues [207] . What more supports this is increased expression of ICOS in autoimmune conditions (acute graft-versus-host disease) and allergic airway diseases [208] . Also, its ligand ICOS-L display by dendritic cells is capable to improve Treg or Th17 responses [209] , whose pathogenic roles in autoimmunity and organ rejection have been well-described [210] . ICOS deficiency in mice could diminish lung tissue fibrosis [211] and delay rejection of the transplanted bronchus by reduction of relative numbers of Th17, Th2, and Treg cells [54] . By contrast, lung fibrosis was exacerbated in isolated ICOS-L deficiency and in double ICOS/ICOS-L deficiency [211] . Loss-of-function mutations in the ICOS gene as seen in patients with ICOS deficiency lead to reduce the numbers of TFH cells [212] . It has been demonstrated that intranasal application of Protollin, a TLR4 ligand adjuvant, can play a protective role against allergic lower airway disease upon stimulation with pollen allergen. This TLR4-dependent protection was accompanied by engagement of CD4+ T-cells expressing ICOS [213] . Additionally, adoptive transfer of CD4+ T-cells expressing ICOS could reverse allergen-induced airway hyper-responsiveness [213] . Whereas, inhibition of TLR4 signaling (TLR4-TRIF pathway) exacerbating allergen-induced airway hyper-responsiveness resulted in a reduction of CD4+ T-cells expressing ICOS [214] . Therefore, ICOS deficiency is expected to increase the risk of allergic airway diseases. As for B-cells expressing CD40, all CVID patients show diminished number of CD4+ T-cells expressing ICOS [215] .",

Upon exposure to viral dsRNA, Ig class switching is induced by TLR3-expressing B-cells of the upper respiratory tract. NFKB activation and TLR3 signaling are central to Ig class switching, which are in turn required for production of IgA and IgG antibodies in response to viral antigens [234] . Patients in intensive care unit (ICU) show increased susceptibility to hospital-acquired pneumonia. This is suggested to be caused by pulmonary IgA deficiency secondary to antibiotic therapy. Patients in this condition often reveal low expression of BAFF [235] . BAFF neutralization in mice has been associated with reduction in the number of antibody-secreting cells (ASC) that contribute to antiviral immunity [218] . Interestingly, immunoglobulin D has been shown to improve immunity in basophils of the upper respiratory tract. Its role is mediated by increasing the expression of proinflammatory in addition to B-cell stimulating factors, for example, BAFF [236] .",

Along with IgG subclass deficiency, partial antibody deficiency with impaired polysaccharide responsiveness, and selective IgA deficiency, transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy (THI) is one of the common immunedeficiency conditions of children [265] , where the certain period of the physiologic hypogammaglobulinemia is extended. The way to diagnose THI is not straightforward; but its diagnosis requires a retrospective look of the patient characteristics: early hypogammaglobulinemia of at least one immunoglobulin isotype, later achieving normal levels for all immunoglobulin isotypes, and no diagnosis more likely than THI is suspected [266] . Overall, recurrent respiratory tract (pneumonia) infections, ENT (otitis media) infections, bronchitis, and asthma are the most common presentations of THI [267] [268] [269] . However, other infectious complications that may affect patients with THI include sinusitis, enteritis, lymphadenitis, meningitis, mastoiditis, impetigo [267] , urinary tract infections, and sepsis [266] . Moreover, atopic reactions in THI are common and mainly include bronchial hyperreactivity, food allergy, and atopic dermatitis [266] . Study of a single center in Jordan estimated that the average age of onset and diagnosis for THI (n = 10) are 1 and 1.6 years [267] . So the diagnostic delay was less than 1 year [267] . In other studies from Turkey and the United States, the mean age of onset was less than 1 year of age [266, 270] . Often it is spontaneously resolved by 3-5 years of age [270] , and more than 90% of patients achieve normal immunoglobulin levels by 10 years of age. However, some patients continue to have hypogammaglobulinemia, the so-called undefined/unclassified hypogammaglobulinemia. Of note is that both conditions, i.e., THI and undefined/unclassified hypogammaglobulinemia, share common clinical characteristics [268] . However, patients with persistent antibody deficiency are less able to produce IgA responses against pneumococcal polysaccharide (PnPS) vaccine compared to patients with transient antibody deficiency [271] .",

For children aged 1-18 years with recurrent infections and warning signs of immunodeficiency, it is the most commonly diagnosed disease [279] . Compared to other PIDs, patients with SIgAD appear to less prone to lower respiratory tract infection, sepsis, skin infections, mucocutaneous candidiasis, dental alterations, cardiovascular malformations, angioedema, hospitalizations, and death [280] . The world's epidemiology data indicate that the incidence of SIgAD varies by a family history of SIgAD and ethnicity ranging from 1:18,500 in Japan to 1:143 in the Arabian Peninsula [278, 281] . Intrinsic factors causing IgA deficiency include both monogenic mutations (TNFRSF13B/ TACI) [282, 283, 220] and chromosomal abnormalities mainly involving chromosome 18 [278, 1] . SIgAD is indicated by low levels of serum IgA (below 7 mg/dl) in presence of normal levels of IgG and IgM after the age of 4 years in whom other causes of hypogammaglobulinemia have not been identified. Clinical presentations may range from asymptomatic to clinically overt complications including recurrent sinopulmonary infections [284] , autoimmune diseases [285] , allergies, atopic disorders [286] , gastrointestinal disorders, and malignancies [278] . Fortunately, about 65-90% of patients with SIgAD are asymptomatic [1, 287] . Only the minority of patients suffer from severe disease. They are those who may progress to CVID at later time points [278] . Follow-up study reveals that unlike patients with partial IgA deficiency and patients with partial IgA + IgG subclass deficiency, patients with selective IgA deficiency never can achieve normal levels of IgA during study [288] .

Two subclasses of IgA are present in humans: IgA1 and IgA2. Circulating IgA which is mainly comprised of IgA1 (80-90%) may help to regulate immune response via activation of the phagocyte system and inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis. Mucosal secretions mainly include IgA2, which is more resistant to bacterial proteases present in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract than IgA1. Secretory IgA contributes to the coating of mucosa-associated bacteria and therefore plays an important role to prevent penetration of bacteria into the mucosa. In addition, patients with SIgAD demonstrated altered cytokine/chemokine system in terms of increased levels of CXCL10/IP-10, IL-10, and G-CSF and decreased levels of IL-9 and IL-12 (p70) [289] . In this manner, SIgAD is regarded as a risk factor of recurrent respiratory infections and bronchial hyper-responsiveness [290] .",

In particular, adults with SIgAD are more prone to upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., infectious conjunctivitis, common viral cold, pharyngitis, and laryngitis) and lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., bronchitis and pneumonia) [287] . Overall, the main pathogens involved are encapsulated bacteria including Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Bronchiectasis and obliterative bronchiolitis represent the most severe respiratory conditions experienced by patients with SIgAD. Studies demonstrate that deficiency of any of IgG subclasses is also present in about 20% of patients with SIgAD [291] , rendering them more susceptible to sinopulmonary infections and respiratory insufficiency [292] . Moreover, patients with a low percentage of switched memory B-cells have a higher incidence of pneumonia and bronchiectasis compared to patients with a high percentage of switched memory B-cells [293] . On the contrary, an increased number of IgM-producing B-cells as a compensatory mechanism are commonly found in SIgAD. Because of the functional overlap between IgA and IgM, high levels of secretory IgM may protect patients against infections and help to maintain them asymptomatic [281] . When compared to controls without SIgAD, adults with SIgAD are more likely to be diagnosed with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, but not asthma [287] .",
