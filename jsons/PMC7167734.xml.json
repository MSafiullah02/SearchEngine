In the last step, we used 5000 cycles of steepest descent and 30 000 cycles of conjugate gradients and no restraints. The heating and equilibration stage was divided into 14 steps. The temperature was gradually increased, until it reached 300 K. Langevin Dynamics (thermostat) were employed with a collision frequency of 3.0 ps \u2212 1. A harmonic potential of 25 Kcal/mol*\u00c52 was employed in the initial steps and was turned off during step 13. The heating procedure lasted 650 ps until step 13 and was performed using an NVT ensemble. Afterward, a 2\u2010ns equilibration phase was employed in an NPT ensemble.

Besides that, this triad seems to be fundamental to complexation with dimannose of microvirin, another cyanobacterial lectin.48 Arginine residues were also conserved at the binding site and they presented relevant energy values in decomposition analysis (Figures 4 and 5). In general, polar residues (Glu, Asp, Arg, Lys), capable of making favorable electrostatic interactions with dimannose, collaborated together with the aspartate, asparagine, and threonine triad in the cyanovirin\u2010ligand complexation.

A genomic search approach returned a reasonable number of sequences with lectin domains and this pipeline may be replicated in different organisms to help in lectin identification, given that the number of sequences annotated as hypothetical protein was superior to 50%. It was also possible to identify two cyanovirin homologues with average sequence identity with PDB proteins, one annotated as cyanovirin and the other as hypothetical protein, both with the binding property demonstrated by molecular dynamics analysis. Additionally, the genomic search allied with homology modeling suggests that the Alkalinema sp. CACIAM 70d lectin model validated here is a binding sugar lectin, the first one reported for this cyanobacteria genus. Thus, the identification and the characterization of new lectins and their homologues are a promising area in antiviral research, and Amazonian cyanobacteria present biotechnological potential to be explored in this regard.",
