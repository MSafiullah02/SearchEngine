Understanding the extent and causes of biases in codon usage is essential to the understanding of viral evolution. However, the factors shaping synonymous codon usage bias and nucleotide composition in human RV-A are currently unknown. In order to gain insight into these matters, we analyzed the codon usage and base composition constraints on the two genes that codify the two outer capsid proteins (VP4 [VP8*] and VP7) of 58 P[4]G2 RV-A strains isolated in Brazil and investigated the possible key evolutionary determinants of codon usage bias. The results of these studies revealed that the frequencies of codon usage in both RV-A proteins studied are significantly different than the ones used by human cells. In order to observe if similar trends of codon usage are found when RV-A complete genomes are considered, we compare these results with results found using a dataset of 10 reference strains for whom the complete codes of the 11 segments are known. Similar results were obtained using capsid proteins or complete genomes. The general correlations found between the position of each sequence on the first axis generated by correspondence analysis and the relative dinucleotide abundances indicate that codon usage in RV-A can also be strongly influenced by underlying biases in dinucleotide frequencies.

This is in agreement with results found for other viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) (Grantham and Perrin, 1986; Kypr and Mrazek, 1987) and hepatitis A virus (Aragones et al., 2008) . In other RNA viruses, like poliovirus or foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) the codon usage is very (Sanchez et al., 2003) . In these cases, competition is avoided by the induction of cellular shutoff of protein synthesis through carboxy cleavage of translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) by 2A and L proteases, respectively (Racaniello, 2001) . Early during the infection process RV-A also takes over the host translation machinery of the cell, causing a shutoff of cell protein synthesis, although by a different mechanism of picornaviruses. After RV-A infection, the translation initiation factor 2a (eIF2a) becomes phosphorylated and remains in this state throughout the virus replication cycle, leading to a further inhibition of cell protein synthesis (Montero et al., 2008) . However, recent studies have shown that under these restrictive conditions, the viral proteins and some cellular proteins are efficiently translated (Montero et al., 2008) .

The CpG deficiency was proposed to be related to the immunostimulatory properties of unmethylated CpG, which were recognized by the host's innate immune system as a pathogen signature (Shackelton et al., 2006; Woo et al., 2007) . This is now known to be triggered by the intracellular Pattern Recognition Receptor (PRR) Toll-like 9 (TLR9), which recognizes CpG-unmethylated DNA, and triggers several immune response pathways (Dorn and Kippenberger, 2008) . Since the vertebrate immune system relies on unmethylated CpG recognition in DNA molecules as a sign of infection, and CpG under-representation in RNA viruses is exclusively observed in vertebrate viruses (Lobo et al., 2009) , it is reasonable to suggest that a TLR9-like mechanism exists in the vertebrate immune system which recognizes CpG when in RNA context (such as in the genomes of RNA viruses) and triggers immune responses (Lobo et al., 2009) .
