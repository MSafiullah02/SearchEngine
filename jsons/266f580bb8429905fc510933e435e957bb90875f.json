A large set of data collected at a worldwide scale during the first months of 2020 is compiled into series of semi-logarithmic plots, for a selection of thirty-two countries from the five continents. Three regimes are identified in the propagation of an epidemic wave: a pre-epidemic regime 1, an exponential-growth regime 2, and a resorption regime 3. A two-parameters scaling of the first-wave death variation reported in China is used to fit those reported in other countries. Comparison is made between the propagation of the pandemic in different countries, which are classified in four groups, from group A where the pandemic first waves were contained efficiently, to group D where the pandemic first waves widely spread. Group A is mainly composed of Asian countries, where fast and efficient measures have been applied. Group D is composed of Western-Europe countries and the United States of America, where late decisions and confused political communication (pandemic seriousness, protection masks, herd immunity etc.) led to significant death tolls. The threat of large resurging epidemic waves after a hasty lockdown lift is discussed, in particular for the countries from group D, where the number of contagious people remained high in the beginning of May 2020. The situation is opposite in Asian countries from group A, where the number of contagious people was successfully maintained to a low level. In particular, the results obtained by Hong Kong and South Korea are highlighted, and the measures taken there are presented as virtuous examples that other countries may follow.",

            "text": "In the first months of 2020, the pandemic first-waves spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 has affected most of the countries worldwide [1] . This disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported in end 2019 in Hubei province, China [2], [3] . At the time of writing this paper (9 May 2020), almost three hundred thousand deaths have been reported and multiple challenges have emerged: slowing down the spread of the virus, offering adapted medical cares, saving lives, developing a vaccine to immunize the population, and anticipating a forthcoming economic crisis. As first step, slowing down the pandemic propagation is essential to limit the number of deaths occurring in a few-week timescale and avoid a cascade of related issues. Without this, a wild and uncontrolled exponential propagation could lead to cumulative death tolls of up to one or a few percent of a population. This corresponds to a situation where herd immunity would be achieved in a 'natural' manner [4] , [5] , [6] . The target to avoid such situation offers a rare case where scientists can directly guide politicians and where their recommendations on short-and mid-term decisions can have enormous impacts for the community. They can monitor the pandemic statistics, they can model it, they can propose solutions to slow down the pandemic propagation, they can follow or anticipate the impacts of given series of political decisions. These last weeks, several epidemiological models and reports emerged [7],[8], [9] , [10] , [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] , [15] some of them having impact in national press and immediate consequences on political decisions. In addition to the work from epidemiologists, modelling and graphical tools have been proposed by physicists (see for instance [16] , [17] , [18] , [19] ). In particular, phenomenological approaches, as that proposed in this work, are suited to monitor the propagation of a pandemic.",

A two-parameter scaling of the death data reported in China is used to fit the first epidemic waves in a selection of countries, where the spread was well-advanced in beginning of May 2020 (USA, Spain, Italy, United Kingdom, France and Germany). The presented graphs constitute simple tools to identify the trends and key moments in the propagation of the pandemic in a country. They offer an easy way to judge and compare the efficiency of social-distancing, containment and lock-down measures. The success of the measures taken in Asian countries is emphasized. The situation in several Western Europe countries and in the United States of America is opposite. Confused political communication about i) the appreciation of the pandemic' seriousness [20] , [21] , ii) recommendations to wear protection masks [22] , and iii) the consequences of a herd immunity scenario [23] , has been observed. In these countries, the delay in the application of strong measures led to tens of thousands of deaths after the first epidemic waves. An early lift of the lockdown may also lead to the resurgence of epidemic waves. The monitoring tools compiled here, once updated, will help in forecasting resurging waves of the pandemic. The fatality rate and the question of achieving herd immunity, as well as the exponential consequences of a delay or inefficiency in the application of measures are discussed.",

Time offsets between the variations from the different countries result from the delayed arrivals of the virus on their territory. China was the first country hit by the pandemic, whose first wave ended in late April 2020, with cumulative confirmed cases saturating at \u2248 80 000 and cumulated deaths saturating < 5 000 (initial saturation to \u2248 3 300 deaths corrected to \u2248 4600 on 17 April 2020). South Korea was hit a few weeks after China and was less affected than the other countries considered here, with < 11 000 cumulative confirmed cases and < 300 cumulative deaths in the beginning of May 2020. The United States of America were the last country of this selection to be hit, but they were the most affected with > 1 000 000 cumulative confirmed cases and > 70 000 cumulative deaths in the beginning of May 2020. The three Western Europe countries were hit a few days after South Korea and were strongly affected, with \u2248 200 000 cumulative confirmed cases and \u2248 30 000 cumulated deaths in each country in the beginning of May 2020. These graphs show that, when the epidemic is active in a country, the number of cumulative deaths increases in an exponential manner, which leads to a linear increase in the semi-logarithmic scale of the graphs.",

For each country, the 'shifted' time is adjusted so that the day D = 0 corresponds to the extrapolation to a number N = 1 of the exponential increase of cumulative deaths. A deviation from the exponential regime is observed in all countries a few days or weeks after the day D = 0. An epidemic peak corresponding to a several-week plateau in the time variation of the daily death number is visible for the six countries considered in Figure 1 . This plateau was always maintained to < 10 daily deaths in South Korea. It reached 100 -200 daily deaths in China, 500 -1 000 daily deaths in the four considered Western Europe countries, and a maximum of 2 000 -4 000 daily deaths in the United States of America. Figure S1 in the Supplementary Materials generalizes the graphs from Figure 1 to a total of thirty-two countries worldwide. It confirms that all countries follow similar trajectories. A large scattering of the data is visible in the plots of the cumulative confirmed cases as a function of the 'shifted' time [ Figure S1 (c)]. Oppositely, the cumulative deaths plotted as a function of the 'shifted' time almost converge on a unique line in the exponential regime of the pandemic propagation [ Figure S1 (f)]. This difference can be explained as the number of cumulative confirmed cases is a less reliable quantity than the number of cumulated deaths, for the following reasons:",

For each country, the variation of the daily death number follows that of the daily confirmed cases, with a delay of 5-10 days. In China, a significant decrease of daily confirmed cases was observed 10 days after the setup of lockdown, and the epidemic peak in the number of daily deaths was observed 10 days later. After this peak, the number of daily deaths has decreased within an exponential decay, as indicated by the negative-slope linear variation in the semi-logarithmic scale of the graphs. Two months later, in the beginning of April, lockdown lift was decided. At this date, there were a few daily deaths and \u2248 50 -100 daily confirmed cases in China. The case of South Korea is unique: after an early increase of daily confirmed cases, this number reached a maximum of \u2248 1 000 before strongly decreasing. In the end of April, less than 2 daily deaths and \u2248 10 daily confirmed cases were reported. Before May, the number of daily deaths has always been contained to less than 10 in South Korea.

In Czech Republic, Italy, Spain, France, and Germany the epidemic peak has been observed for both numbers of daily cumulative cases and deaths. However, in Italy a few weeks after the peak the number of daily deaths decreased with a slower rate than in China. In the United States of America and in the United Kingdom, both daily confirmed cases and death tolls have been saturating in the last weeks of April, and no clear peak emerged so far from the plateaus. In all of these western countries (except Czech Republic), daily confirmed cases and death numbers are still several orders of magnitude higher than those in China when lockdown was lifted, or than those in South Korea after the epidemic peak. Figure 3 focuses on a comparison between two neighbors from the Scandinavian Peninsula: Sweden and Norway. Beyond their geographic and climatic similarities, both countries are quite comparable in term of population and density (10 million inhabitants and 450 000 km 2 for Sweden, 5.4 million inhabitants and 385 000 km 2 for Norway [35] ). The pandemic started in these two territories almost simultaneously, as shown by the sudden increase of daily confirmed cases after the 1 March [ Figure 3 (a)] and of the daily deaths [ Figure 3 (b)] two weeks later in both countries. Two opposite strategies were followed by Sweden and Norway to face the pandemic. Sweden was guided by the target to let the pandemic spreading over the territory, so that herd immunity [4],[5],[6] is achieved in a 'natural' manner [36] .

The effects of these measures are visible in Figure 3 , with broad maxima centered on 27 March in the daily cumulative cases, and on 10 April in the daily deaths. In the beginning of May, the first epidemic wave has almost ended in Norway, with < 1 'average' daily deaths and < 30 daily confirmed cases. In Sweden, without lockdown the number of daily reported cases and deaths increased before reaching a plateau with 300-900 daily confirmed cases and 10-200 daily deaths. A large noise in the data indicates a difficulty to collect data in this country. In the beginning of May 2020, \u2248 200 cumulative deaths were reported in Norway and > 3 000 cumulative deaths were reported in Sweden, where the first epidemic wave was about to continue and to lead to a higher death toll. The comparison between Sweden and Norway is a direct illustration of the human cost of the herd immunity strategy. Figure 4 focuses on the variation of cumulated death and daily death tolls normalized per 100 000 inhabitants for four countries: China, South Korea, Italy and France. In the nonnormalized graphs plotted in Figure 1 (c,f,i), the date corresponding to the day D = 0 of the 'shifted' time scale was defined by adjusting the extrapolation of the exponential-growth regime to N = 1 cumulative death. Since the criterion N = 1 is not proportional to the population, if we compare two countries of different populations and hit at the same time by the pandemic, a later 'shifted' date D is artificially defined for the country of smaller population. The consideration of data normalized with regard to the population permits to avoid this artefact. In Figure 4 , but also in the next graphs presenting tolls normalized per 100 000 inhabitants, the day d = 0 is defined as the extrapolation of the exponential-growth regime to n = 0.001 cumulative deaths / 100 000 inhabitants. Normalized death tolls will be systematically considered in Section 3, where a quantitative comparison of the pandemic spread is proposed for thirty-two countries worldwide. Figure 4 indicates that three regimes can be identified in a single-wave propagation of the pandemic:",

The evolution of the cumulative death toll is estimated using a smoothed curve constructed from the Chinese cumulative death variation. For each wave, two parameters are adjusted: an offset in time and a scaling factor F in the death number. The scaling factor F corresponds to the ratio of cumulative deaths at the beginning of the lockdown and at the end of the epidemic wave. Efficient lockdown measures are associated with a smaller value of F. Graphically, in a semi-logarithmic scale this simply corresponds to a translation of the dashed black line initially adjusted on China's data. These fits summarized in Figure 5 do not intend to precisely predict the final number of cumulative deaths for an on-going epidemic wave. They show that the dynamics of a COVID-19 wave is similar in the different countries, and they indicate the typical time scales and the orders of magnitude of the final death tolls expected at the end of an epidemic wave.",

For France, the best fit to the data, with a factor F = 160, corresponds to a final number of 28 000 cumulative deaths for the first wave.

For Italy and South Korea two successive waves are used to describe an anomalously-long epidemic plateau. For Italy, the fit is compatible with a first wave of 20 000 final cumulative deaths, with a maximum peaked 40 days after the start of regime 2, and a second wave of 11 500 final cumulative deaths, with a maximum peaked 60 days after the start of regime 2. For South Korea, the fit is compatible with a first wave of 115 final cumulative deaths, with a maximum peaked 20 days after the start of regime 2, and a second wave of 135 final cumulative deaths, with a maximum peaked 50 days after the start of regime 2. The results from these phenomenological fits are in good agreement with those from more sophisticated models (see for instance [15] ). Figure 6 summarizes the fits made here for the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, France, and Germany. In this graph, the daily death tolls are plotted as function of non-shifted date. Two months after an epidemic peak of 100-200 daily deaths, China ended the lockdown in Wuhan, where the virus has been the most active, on 8 April. At this date, the daily death number was of the order of 1. An almost-constant negative slope in the evolution of the daily death numbers, in this semi-logarithmic plot, was reported during the two months after the epidemic peak in China. It indicates an exponential decay of the daily death number with time. Assuming a similar decay for the other countries, longer lockdown duration is expected in countries where the epidemic peak reached a higher level. However, contrary to the Chinese strategy, in beginning of May 2020 most of the Western countries were planning to lift their lockdown soon after the epidemic peak, at a date where hundreds of daily deaths were still reported.",

In most of the countries, a similar exponential-growth regime is observed in the time-evolution of the death numbers. The efficiency of the measures taken in Asia is revealed spectacularly in the graphs of Figure 7 : the death tolls per 100 000 inhabitants are two orders of magnitude smaller in Asian countries than in the western countries listed above. A maximum of 3-4 daily deaths / 100 000 inhabitants has been reported in Belgium, which is the mostly-affected country. Maxima of 1-2 daily deaths / 100 000 inhabitants were reported in several Western Europe countries, as Spain, France, Italy, United Kingdom and Sweden, and in the United States of America. The spread of the pandemic is heterogeneous in Europe, and countries as Greece, Czech Republic, and Norway succeeded to contain it to < 0.2 daily deaths / 100 000 inhabitants, which is a few times higher than the rates < 0.05 daily deaths / 100 000 inhabitants reported in Asian countries. In the Supplementary Materials (Section S4), we show that similar inhomogeneity can be observed at a national scale, once regions and departments are considered separately. In other parts of the world (Africa, South America, Australia), the reported death numbers indicate a situation in-between that in Asia and that in mostly-affected western countries, due to the combination of late arrivals of the virus on the territory and possible local specificities (density of population, weather, etc.).",

Early lockdown dates, before or a few days after the d = 0 start of the exponential-growth regime 2, characterize the countries from Group A (those who applied lockdown). On the contrary, all countries from Group D (with the exception of Sweden) applied a late lockdown, about three weeks after the start of the exponential-growth regime 2. Most countries from Groups B and C are in an intermediate situation. Figure 9 presents the time variation of the ratio between the cumulative deaths and confirmed cases for the selection of countries considered here. The 'shifted' times used in this graph were defined by considering normalized death tolls per 100 000 inhabitants (see Figure 7) . Even in the case of a perfect 'measurement', where the cumulated deaths and confirmed cases would be well-estimated, their ratio would not be constant with time, due to the time delay between contaminations and deaths. For a perfect 'measurement', this ratio would lead asymptotically to the fatality rate of the epidemic at the end of an epidemic wave. However, this rate is not universal, since it can vary from one country to another, due to different weather conditions, population characteristics (age, obesity, density, etc.), medical care means, and possibly virus mutations. In real life, measurements are imperfect and the means to detect COVID-19 cases are more or less efficient, depending on the country. The large scattering of data in Figure 9 mainly results from these counting limitations. Since cumulative death tolls are expected to be more reliable than confirmed case tolls, the ratio at the end of an epidemic wave reaches a value higher than the fatality rate when measurements are imperfect. We can suspect that a small country doing a high number of tests may be able to reach a ratio close to the fatality rate. This may be the case of Hong-Kong, for which the ratio converges to 0.4 % at the end of the epidemic wave, which may be compatible with a fatality rate of \u2248 0.5 %. This value corresponds to estimates of fatality rates, ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 %, proposed in Refs.",

Due to the delay between contaminations and their consequences (including deaths), this estimation is more appropriate for countries at the end of an epidemic wave. Table 1 shows the estimated proportions of the population infected by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 at the date of 29 April 2020: less than 0.1 % in countries of the group A, between 0.1 and 1 % in countries of the group B, between 1 and 2 % in countries of the group C, and more than 4 % in countries of the group D. A maximum of 15 % of infected people is estimated for Belgium, which is the mostly-affected country. For all countries from Group D, these tolls remain far below from the proportion of 60 % expected to achieve herd immunity. In the mostly-affected parts in Europe (as department Bas-Rhin in France, see Section S4 in the Supplementary Materials), a maximum of 100 cumulative deaths per 100 000 inhabitants was reported and we can estimate that 20 % of the population was contaminated. In these highly-affected areas, the number of contaminated cases is still far from the proportion of 60 %. On 27 April, New-York City was one of the mostly-affected areas in the world, with 19 561 cumulative deaths reported [24] , which corresponds to 0.235 % of its population of 8.3 million inhabitants [53]. Assuming a fatality rate of 0.5 %, we can estimate that 47 % of the population was infected by the virus. New-York city may be soon the first area with several million inhabitants where herd immunity is achieved. These rough estimations also confirm that herd immunity would be an option of very high human cost if achieved at a worldwide scale (see also Section S3 in the Supplementary Materials).",

Lockdown has been applied to the whole country on 17 March and a deviation from the exponential growth of the death tolls can be seen ten days later in most regions. After the 15 April a decay of the daily death tolls is observed in all regions. In region Ile-de-France, an upward variation is visible a few days after the lockdown start, and a downturn deviation from the exponential growth appeared only two weeks later. Without surprise, the lower death tolls are reported in the regions where the epidemic arrived later. In these West and South-West regions, lockdown started when the death tolls were low. It permitted to contain their increase more efficiently than in the North and North-East regions. Disparity between regions is evidenced in Figure S5 (c,f), where the death tolls / 100 000 inhabitants are shown to be 20 times higher in regions Grand-Est and Ile-de-France than in the less-impacted regions. Region Ile-de-France follows region Grand-Est with 5 days delay, indicating that lockdown start has been less efficient in Ile-de-France. Figure S7 presents the evolution of the death tolls in a selection of the mostly-impacted French departments. Only deaths in hospitals are considered in these graphs. Figure S8 shows a map of the East of France where the shifts in time are indicated for each of the considered departments. These shifts were defined from the numbers of deaths normalized per 100 000 inhabitants [56] . They give an estimation of the delay of the exponential regime 2 start, by comparison with China [ Figure S7 (c-f)]. After the 15 April a decline of the daily death tolls is observed in all considered departments. These graphs confirm that the deviation from regime 2 occurs later in departments from region Ile-de-France than in the other departments. A maximum of 4 daily deaths per 100 000 inhabitants has been reported in the department Bas-Rhin and corresponds to the maximal value observed in Belgium, the highest national maximum reported in the world before mid-May 2020.",

Figure S9 presents the evolution of cumulative and daily death tolls in France, with annotations indicating political recommendations and measures, as well as the last observed mass events. A downturn deviation from exponential growth regime was observed on 15 March, but it has been almost cancelled by a 50 % daily increase of the cumulative deaths on 19 March. National lockdown was applied on 17 March. After the 2 April, the deaths in nursing homes were also counted, leading to an upward correction of the cumulative death toll. Figure S9 (b) indicates that the epidemic peak can be identified on 11 April, in the center of a 20-days long plateau in the daily death toll. The decline of daily deaths observed in the second half of April is the consequence of the lockdown measures taken three weeks before. Figure  S8 shows no evidence that the different and progressive measures taken from 5 to 17 March had some effect against the pandemic propagation. As detailed in Section S2, a simple consequence of these progressive measures was a delay in the application of strong and efficient measures, which could have led to a much smaller death toll if applied earlier. .
