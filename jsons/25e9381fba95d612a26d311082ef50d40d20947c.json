Initially, the specimen source and patient symptoms should be ascertained, as these will lend suggestions of possible agents while eliminating others; however, this information should not be allowed to prejudice observation in such a way as to cause oversight of a n unlikely pathogen. Second, selection of the method of preparation should be based on sample consistency; extraction, debris clarification, concentration, tissue culture amplification, or embedment may be necessary. Finally, false-positive results must be avoided by differentiating viruses from cell organelles or debris, mycoplasmal or bacterial contamination, and bacteriophages.",

In addition to previous rationales for viral diagnosis-including quarantine of infected patients, immunoglobulin and vaccination prophylaxis, and avoidance of unnecessary antibacterial therapythe advent of new and better antiviral agents has prompted a n increasing demand for laboratory analysis of clinical viral pathogens. Many hospitals have viral diagnostic laboratories that make use of tissue culture and light microscope examination of the cytopathological effect (CPE) of inocula on cells.",

            "text": "Obtaining the results from a viral culture takes several days or longer. Additionally, some viruses are nonculturable. For these reasons, direct examination of the specimen by electron microscopy (EM) within minutes to a few hours can be of value. Few hospitals are equipped yet to handle routine EM of viral specimens; thus, frequently, a n existing research laboratory, proficient in EM but not necessarily involved in virus research, is asked to examine clinical samples. This paper is designed as an aid to microscopists in this situation, and it is organized from the point of view of determining an unknown in a given material rather than describing viruses in taxonomic families. Preparation of specimens likely to be received will be discussed along with a description of potential agents in each specimen. Micrographs of representative viruses are presented here. Several good atlases, organized by virus family, are available as aids in virus identification (Dalton and Haguenau, 1973; Hsiung, 1982; Hsiung and Green, 1978; Madeley, 1972; McLean and Wong, 1984; Palmer and Martin, 1982) .

Serological tests for viral antibodies are hampered by the fact that in early infection, titers may not have risen and may be totally absent in immunodeficient patients. Serological tests for the virus itself may not detect low amounts of antigens in early infection; some viruses do not have the hemagglutinating antigens used in LA, PHA, and HI tests. The advantages of serological tests are the relatively simple and inexpensive procedures, as well as rapid results. Culturing techniques have disadvantages in that several cell lines must be maintained continuously for inoculation at appropriate cell confluency, in that some viruses do not grow (easily or at all) in culture, and in that light microscope CPE may require several days before becoming evident. However, if virus numbers are low owing to early infection or inadequate sampling (as in biopsies), amplification in tissue culture can increase the chances of visualization. In tests designed to identify viral components, the disadvantage is that one must have a wide variety of reagents (e.g., antisera, nucleic acid probes, protein standards) on hand, as well as have some idea of possible infectious agents so that the number of tests is not prohibitive. The advantages are that they are highly sensitive and specific.",

(Concentration methods are described below.) The sample should be cleared of cell debris by low-speed centrifugation at 1,500g for 1-2 min. If the supernatant is still cloudy, the speed andor time can be increased. Do not exceed about 2,200g for 10 min, since it is possible for virus to be present in large clumps or attached to membrane fragments that would be pelleted and discarded (Narang and Codd, 1981) . Put a drop of supernatant onto a waxed surface such as parafilm; place a formvar or colloidion and carboncoated grid, membrane side down, on the drop and cover with a petri dish lid for 5-10 min. If the specimen drop appears thick or darkly colored, wash the grid briefly before draining by touching it to a drop of water. If not, drain with filter paper directly upon removal from the drop. If a suspected virus is in a salt solution (buffer or gradient material) after attempted concentration or purification, or if a serious health hazard such as hepatitis is suspected, place the grid onto the specimen drop for 5-10 min; drain briefly, but do not dry; then place it onto a drop of 3% glutaraldehyde in buffer (phosphate or cacodylate, O.lM, pH 7.4) for 5-10 min. Wash the grid gently with water, and drain. Negatively stain by placing the grid, membrane side down, onto a drop of 2% aqueous uranyl acetate (VA) or phosphotungstic acid (PTA). If no virions are evident, try one of the concentration methods. Other methods that may be useful for viruses in salt solution are the pseudoreplica technique and the agar-diffusion-filtration method (see below). Bear in mind that negative stains are heavy metals and should not be left to dry on pipettes and in places where the dust can become airborne and breathed. Also, UA is radioactive.",

The basic principle is that liquid is absorbed through a membrane with a small pore size that retains viruses in the original vessel. The pore size selected should retain particles that are greater than or equal to 20 nm (e.g., microfilter 55009 and membrane E142, pore size 0.015-0.010 pm; Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH). It is imperative that debris be removed by centrifugation prior to ultrafiltration, even at the expense of pelleting viral clumps; otherwise the membrane will become clogged. The filtration unit with clarified suspension is then centrifuged at 3,500 rpm for a few minutes (3-5 min). The material on the filter is rinsed off with a drop (20 pl) of water, placed on a membrane-coated grid, and negatively stained. Another unit, called a miniultrafiltration cell, model 3 is available from Amicon (Amicon Corp., Danver, MA) and can be used with a membrane of 100,000 MW cutoff, which should retain particles of 20 nm. The unit costs several hundred dollars, requires a stirrer and an N2 source, and may require up to 2 hr to achieve concentration. As above, clogging by debris may be a problem. These methods can be used in the absence of access to an ultracentrifuge, but then may lose clumped virions in the clarification step.",

This method allows excess liquid and salts to be absorbed into agar, leaving virions on the surface. Clarify the suspension of debris by low-speed centrifugation and place a drop onto each of several agar blocks previously prepared (see below). When the liquid has been absorbed into the agar, drop 0.5% formvar from a Pasteur pipette onto the agar. With a new, cleaned razor blade, trim the block sides so that the edges are smooth. Float the membrane off the agar onto a water surface in the same manner as floating it off a glass slide for the preparation of membranecoated grids (Hyatt, 1970) . If trouble is encountered in detaching the film from the agar, try turning the block on its side on the slide and trimming the edges perpendicular to the membrane surface so that a 1-mm slice is removed from each edge. This prevents the blade from pushing the membrane into the agar from the top surface. Place a grid(s) on the membrane surface. (Virus, if present, is underneath.) To pick up the grids, place a small piece (1-2 cm2) of filter paper over the grids and membrane on the surface of the water, and when it becomes wet, lift it out by the edge with a pair of forceps. This filter paper technique is easier than removing the grids with a peg, screen, or glass slide. Virus, if present, will now be on top of the membrane. Negatively stain. Sharp (1960) originally described the pseudoreplica technique with instructions to \"float the membrane off onto 2% Pl'A.\" This method requires a large volume of stain and may retain virions in the stain, preventing its use for other specimens.",

If there is already a hint of viral identity from other studies or symptoms, specific antisera can be used, but if the agent is unknown, pooled gamma-globulin may contain the right antibody. We have found serum from migrant farm workers to be particularly useful, since they have been exposed to many pathogens. Commercial gamma-globulin is also available. After clarification of large particles, add pooled serum to the sample at a final dilution of 1:lOO or 1:200; specific antiserum can be diluted up to 1500 to 1:1,000 depending on the serum. Complex formation will be diminished or lost if there is antibody or antigen excess (Almeida and Waterson, 1969) , but when both specimen and antibody concentrations are unknown, these dilutions are a range within which to start. The volume of antiserum added should be kept low to prevent dilution of the virus; thus, antiserum stored frozen at a 1:lO dilution can be added to the virus suspension at a 1:10, 1:2O, 150, or 1:lOO dilution without substantially increasing the volume. Incubate 0.5 hr at 37\"C, 1 hr at 25\"C, or overnight at 4\"C, inverting periodically to mix.

We use an airfuge at 100,OOOg (30 psi) for 30 min, which also pellets single virions in the event no recognition has occurred.

The overall shape is spherical (round in negative stain); compare to the hexagonal (or geodesic) shape of adenovirus. The capsomers are tubular and are oriented in the shape of \"wheel spokes.\" A thin rim surrounds the spokes (single arrowhead); this outer layer sometimes is lost if the virus is degraded. The presence of lattice structures (double arrowheads), the subunits of which are of the size and hexagonal shape of capsomers, is diagnostic; they are sometimes seen late in infection in the absence of complete virions. This material should not be confused with bacteriophage tail and neck proteins (see text and Fig. 14) . b. Another isolate from stool.

            "text": "The specimen most likely to be sent for electron microscopy is fecal material from children with gastroenteritis. The reasons are multiple: a) Some of the viral agents that cause this problem either cannot be grown in tissue culture or are culturable only with special techniques not routinely used in a viral diagnostic lab; b) a rapid diagnosis is necessary so that clinicians can differentiate bacterial from viral infections for proper treatment; c) biochemical and serological assays (see Background) are so specific that one must have some hint as to which agent to seek; the Rotazyme assay (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) detects rotavirus but would miss the many other enteric viruses. To prepare the specimen, suspend fecal material in water at approximately 20%; e.g., usin a n applicator stick, scrape about 2-3 mm of sample and transfer it to a microfuge tube; stir to a smooth consistency; add 2-3 B laxed, and the size has increased also, some areas have patches of material resembling the outer rim (arrowhead). Other researchers might argue that it is reovirus, which can be seen in the respiratory tract and occasionally in stool. Reovirus does not have the outer rim, but otherwise resembles rotavirus. c. Reovirus in tissue culture; the micrograph is of two areas of the same cell. Human rotavirus, which does not grow in tissue culture except under very special conditions, resembles reovirus when seen in biopsy tissue. Cytoplasmic factories contain virions with an electron-dense center and occasionally empty capsid shells. The viruses are usually in a granular matrix, associated with microtubules, and do not form crystals as adenoviruses do. Bars in a,b represent 0.1 pm; c, 1 pm. A microfuge is handy because only a small amount of sample is needed, but if it is not available, use a desk-top centrifuge or other instrument. Place a drop of supernatant on a membrane-covered grid and negatively stain (see above). Agents found in stool are rota-, adeno-, entero-, parvo-, minireo-, calici-, astro-, and coronaviruses and Norwalk agent. In cases of hepatitis, hepatitis A virus may be seen, though hepatitis is diagnosed routinely by serology. Most of the small viruses cannot be differentiated owing to lack of capsomeric detail, but some do have definitive morphology (e.g., calci-, astro-, and minireovirus). In reporting results, \"small, round, fuzzy viruses\" may be described as 20-, 30-, 40-, or 50-nm particles, singly or in clumps, with a n indication of numbers, (e.g., many, few, number per grid hole, etc.), but not by name. Viruses with a definitive morphology can be diagnosed by name, e.g., adenoor rotavirus; if the morphology is definite, one particle is sufficient for a diagnosis. The smaller viruses, however, must be differentiated from bacteriophages; see the section on Confusing Elements. Clues in the detection of an etiological agent are the presence of many particles or clumps of particles. Also look for uniformity of size and apparent \"hardness\" of the protein coat. Bacteriophages sometimes have membranous coatings that become distorted during preparation and then appear to have wrinkles. The membrane may become broken so that stain penetrates easily, creating a \"bull's eye\" appearance. Except for adenovirus, particles with a strongly angular (hexagonal or pentagonal) shape are also phages. Anything with a tail is a phage and though interesting, is of no significance in the disease. See the Agents section in Results and Discussion and the figures for a detailed description of the virions. Intestinal viruses are also covered in detain by Tyrell and Kapikian (1982) .",

The nucleocapsid containing the nucleic acid may (e.g., herpes) or may not (e.g., retrovirus) be surrounded by a rigid protein coat; and the capsid may be spherical (e.g., herpes), helical (e.g., measles), or complex (e.g., pox). Because of the pliable nature of the membrane, these viruses are pleomorphic, and some (e.g., rubella) may be difficult to distinguish by negative stain from cell membrane debris. If the stain penetrates the outer membrane so that the inner structure is visible (Fig. 8a) , or if the surface has spikes (Fig. 7a) , identification is easier. A few membraned virions have a definite shape: Rhabdoviruses are bullet-shaped, and poxviruses are brick-shaped. In the case of pox, the membrane is synthesized de novo in the cytoplasm, rather than during budding; this membrane tightly surrounds the nucleocapsid so that the virion is not pleomorphic. In thin sections, the cellular location of virus can be a hint as to the type of nucleic acid, and thus to identification. DNA viruses are generally produced in cell nuclei (e.g., adenovirus), whereas RNA viruses are generally produced in the cytoplasm (e.g., picornavirus), but there are exceptions. Poxviruses (DNA) are constructed in the cytoplasm. Herpes viruses replicate in the nucleus and bud through the nuclear membrane; although only nucleocapsids are found in the nucleus, nucleocapsids and whole virions can be seen in the cytoplasm. Some viruses have a preference for certain organ systems; thus, if the sample origin is considered, some agents can be ruled out.

Figures  13-25 illustrate some of these structures. It will be obvious to most observers that anything between 20 nm and 70 nm with a tail is a bacteriophage (Fig. 13a-h) (Ackerman and Nguyen, 1983; Kawaoka et al., 1982; Teuber and Lembke, 1983; Walker and Walker, 19831 , is not pathogenic to humans, and thus is insignificant in viral gastroenteritis. However, many phages lack tails and can easily be confused with enteroviruses. Clues to the relevance of small particles are a) large numbers (10 to several hundred per grid hole), b) clumps of 3 or 4 to 100, and c) uniformity of size and shape. Enteroviruses range from 20 to 50 nm (Fig. 3) , but within a given type, are all one size; they have rigid protein coats that retain their spherical shape (are not deformable), rarely show facets, and never show wrinkles. Phages may be produced as proheads, complete heads, or head and tailed varieties; thus, one kind may come in several different sizes. Some phages are oval (Driedonks and Caldentey, 1983) . Many have soft membrane-like heads, which, after drying, appear to have wrinkles (Fig.  13i ) (Driedonks and Caldentey, 1983; Fuller and King, 1982; Walker and Walker, 1983) . Phages may be seen attached to bacteria, flagella, and pili (Beibricher and Diiker, 1984; Coetzee et al., 1983) . They also may clump together in a manner similar to human virus clumped by antibody, but usually the stain, especially uranyl acetate, penetrates many of the particles, making the nucleic acid stand out and producing a \"bull's eye\" pattern (Fig. 13e,ij) (Fuller and King, 1982: Figs. 8, 10) . If a particle is less than 75 nm, has triangular facets, or appears strongly hexagonal or pentagonal (Fig. 13k, arrowhead) , it is probably a phage (Kwiatkowski et al., 1982; Ramsay and Ritchie, 1984; Walker and Walker, 19831 , though picornaviruses are icosahedral, and some may demonstrate facets, e.g., polio (Fig. 3a) . Adenovirus may also appear hexagonal, but it is large (75 nm), with clearly distinguishable eapsomers (Fig. la) , and is not easily confused with any other virus.",

In Figure 15c , a 40-nm virus particle stands out among smaller droplets; if it had been in the field of Figure 15b , it would be unrecognizable. The small irregular droplets should not be confused with picornaviruses. Another factor in virus identification, particularly in sizing, is to select areas where the negative stain has spread evenly and without bubbles. In Fig-ure 3c, some virions are of a uniform spherical shape, whereas others appear to have excess stain around them (arrowhead). This drying artifact results in distorted shape and size.",

Though some viruses mature by budding through the plasma membrane to the outside of the cell (e.g., herpes, HTLV), others may bud into intracytoplasmic vesicles (e.g., herpes, Fig. 8b ). Caveolae cut perpendicuhr to the cell membrane can be seen invaginating (Fig. Ma) ; cut parallel to the plane of the membrane, they may show more or less regular circles (Fig. 18b) . They do not contain dense cores; see Figures 8 and 10. Coated pits and vesicles (Fig. 18c,d) are studded with clathrin projections on the outside of the structure, but internal to the cell. Most Fig. 18. a,b. Caveolae are invaginations of cell membrane and do not contain dense centers as do viruses. They are somewhat irregular in size. Compare them to coated vesicles (c,d) which have spikes on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Coated pits and vesicles should not be confused with myxoviruses, where spikes occur on the extracellular side (Fig. 7) . Bars represent 0.1 pn. Fig. 20 . Secretory products (a, arrowheads), and dilated endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi vesicles cut in cross section (b, arrowhead) may resemble viruses.

A section tangential to the nucleus may cut nuclear pores (arrowheads) in such a way that they resemble a factory of RNA viruses in the cytoplasm. b. If the plane t r a m the two nuclear membranes, pores (double arrowheads) may resemble DNA viruses in the nucleus. c. If the section plane is just inside the inner membrane, as is a section along the plane of the long arrows in b, the nucleus may appear \"holey\" where the heterochromatin does not approach the pores. (Micrographs courtesy of Ben Spurlock, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, GA.) Bars represent 1 pm. spiked viruses (e.g., measles [ Fig. 71 and influenza) obtain their membranes as they bud out of the cell with the projections exterior. Thus, complete virions are found extracellularly. An exception to this is coronavirus, which buds into cell vesicles. However, this agent is rarely seen in tissue sections; it is usually diagnosed by negative staining.",
