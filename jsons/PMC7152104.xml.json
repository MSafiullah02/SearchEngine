During parturition, it is possible that the neonate may be affected by a damaging degree of anoxia. Several mechanisms help the neonate to adapt to extrauterine life. The first is an increase in fetal cortisol concentration, which triggers parturition and allows adequate levels of surfactant to be produced by type II alveolar pneumocytes. In addition to elevated cortisol concentration, a catecholamine surge occurs. A negative side effect of this physiologic feature is that it may allow potential problems to be masked and the newborn to appear normal immediately after parturition, even though it may have substantial physiologic impairment.5\n",

Birth weights vary significantly from one farm to another and reflect most likely the feeding management on that farm as well as genetic influence (Table 25-2\n). A tendency toward higher birth weight than originally described has been observed in many alpaca farms in North America. In alpacas in South American conditions, birth weights have tended to increase with increasing age of the dam, and low birth weights have been associated with an increased risk of neonatal death.8 Birth weights tend to decrease after 11 years.8 No studies have been performed on the effect of the sire on birth weight in these species. It is not uncommon for crias to lose some weight in the first 24 hours (120 to 250 grams [g] in alpacas and 250 to 500 g in llamas). In alpacas, the average daily weight gain in crias is 195 g under grazing conditions in South America.3\n",

Therefore, newborn camelids are born hypogammaglobulinemic and rely on passive transfer of immunity through colostrum intake.9 Increased incidence of illness and death from infections in neonates is associated with inadequate passive transfer of immunoglobulin as measured by low serum immunoglobulin concentrations in sick or dead neonates.10 Conversely, successful immunoglobulin transfer is associated with low infection rates and the high likelihood of survival. Even though this is true, great differences exist among farms with regard to immunoglobulin concentrations in healthy neonates. The effect of between-farm variations, which could involve factors such as management practices, including biosecurity measures, nutrition, vaccination programs, current pathogen history, herd bloodlines, geographic location, and climate, would enable a neonate with failure of passive transfer to remain healthy.",

It is highly recommended that alpaca and llama breeding operations be prepared for a possible need for colostrum supplementation by having a stock of frozen caprine or bovine colostrum. Veterinary clinics can play a role in colostrum banking for their clients. Colostrum should be collected from healthy dams and stored properly. Our recommendation is to store colostrum in individual feeding units (60 to 90 milliliters [mL]) using regular freezer bags or freezer bags for human breast milk. All bags should be labeled with identification of the dam and date of collection. Ideally, colostrum should be frozen at \u201320\u00b0C or in a scientific freezer. Colostrum should not be frozen in a frost-free freezer. Adequately prepared and frozen colostrum keeps its properties for at least 1 year. Frozen colostrum should be thawed out slowly and brought up to body temperature before administration. Rapid thawing at high temperature or in a high-power microwave is not good because it may denature the antibodies in colostrum. Thawing is best accomplished by placing small quantities of colostrum-containing bags in a water bath at body temperature.",

Crias should receive 10% of their body weight in the first 12 hours of life divided into meals every 2 hours. This usually represents about 60 to 90 mL every 2 hours. Some practitioners prefer to give 5% of body weight in a feeding followed by another feeding of equal quantity 6 to 8 hours later because small intake volumes may accelerate gut closure for colostrum. The best way to administer colostrum is by bottle-feeding. In case of poor suckling reflex, colostrum may be administered via orogastric intubation (24-French). Care should be taken not to place the tube in the respiratory tract (trachea). The tube should be felt by palpation as it goes down the left side of the neck. It should be kept within the esophagus to provide closure of the esophageal groove and avoid depositing milk within the first stomach compartment, which would increase the risks of fermentation. Repeated tube feeding may cause esophagitis.13\n",

Most commonly, affected animals will suffer from severe respiratory, circulatory, or metabolic complications. Heart defects (i.e., ventricular septal defect [VSD], tetralogy of Fallot [ToF]) may be very severe and lead to death of the cria within a few hours, but most will survive for a few days to months, with the only abnormality being failure to grow normally. We have observed episodes of syncope after exercise in crias with severe heart defects. Several factors, including genetics, teratogenic viral infections, or teratogenic drug or plant intoxication, as well as abnormal uterine environment, may contribute to the development of congenital abnormalities. Often the practitioner is faced with four main questions: (1) Is the defect genetic? (2) Is it lethal? (3) Will the defect affect the welfare of the animal? (4) Will the defect be exacerbated by reproduction (i.e., pregnancy)?34 Unfortunately, available data do not always answer these questions. It is essential that clients be educated about the necessity to perform a necropsy on stillborn or dead neonates to determine exactly the cause of the death, if possible. In many cases, more than one abnormality is found to be present. Without proper diagnosis, no action can be taken to understand the genetic nature of some of these abnormalities.",

The condition is suspected if the newborn has some respiratory difficulties, particularly when attempting to feed. In complete bilateral choanal atresia, the cria may demonstrate severe dyspnea and open-mouth breathing. Verification of air flow can be achieved by placing a dry glass slide or a mirror under the nostril and checking for fogging. Another option is to pass a soft Foley catheter up each nostril to detect any obstruction at the level of the medial canthus. Diagnosis is confirmed by mouth-to-nose artificial breathing or by using contrast radiography after injection of a radiopaque substance in the nasal cavity or by using computed tomography of the head to demonstrate the presence of a membranous or osseous separation between the nasal and pharyngeal cavities at the level of the choanae.35, 36, 37 Surgical correction of choanal atresia has been attempted, but euthanasia should be considered because of the high rate of complications and their effects on quality of life. Maxillofacial agenesis or dysgenesis (\u201cwry face\u201d) may be associated with choanal atresia as part of a complex genetic disorder (Figure 25-4\n).38\n",

Clinical signs of meconium impaction include straining, squatting, and tail wagging. These signs progress to anorexia, bloating, and signs of abdominal discomfort. Initial treatment consists of one or two warm soapy water enemas (20 to 40 mL). If after two enemas, the meconium has not passed, intravenous fluids may be indicated. Multiple soapy water enemas may irritate the rectal mucosa and result in severe straining and rectal prolapse.12 Various preparations, including magnesium sulfate, human phosphate preparations, and acetylcysteine-containing preparations, have been used. The last are particularly helpful when meconium is very dry and sticky. Neonates that have retained meconium may have other abnormalities and should be examined closely.

Umbilical hernias are relatively common, but most will resolve spontaneously or with belt (vet-wrap) management if less than 3 cm. Umbilical hernias that persist or continue to increase in size require surgical repair. We have seen umbilical hernia and rupture of the abdominal wall with evisceration following dystocia caused by a term uterine torsion, possibly from twisting of the cord around the fetus. These are easily repaired surgically. Omphalophlebitis may develop later in life in crias that were born in unsanitary conditions or had a failure of passive transfer. Patent urachus may be observed but is less common than in other species.",

These problems are often associated with crowding, primiparous females (poor mothering ability), unattended lengthy parturition, agalactia, or congenital abnormalities preventing the neonate from standing and nursing normally. They are easily prevented by closely monitoring term dams and providing a clean warm environment for parturition. Resuscitation of the compromised cria requires a warm environment and treatment of failure of passive transfer and dehydration. Hypothermia and depression may also be seen in crias with severe blood loss from the umbilicus or rupture.",

Peak production is reached about 3 weeks after parturition (2325 \u00b1 480 mL in llamas and 1938 \u00b1 290 mL in alpacas).51 Available information is limited, but lactation persistency and the general lactation curve resemble those of cattle (Figure 25-12\n). Following the peak period, milk production drops at a rate of 9% weekly. Peak and total milk production increase with the age of the dam. Weaning of crias takes place usually between ages 4 and 6 months. It is important to note that milk production in alpacas and llamas tends to dry up very quickly after weaning or loss of the cria.",

Under South American grazing conditions, weight and BCS do not seem to be greatly affected by lactation. In one study, plasma urea nitrogen and creatinine were seen to be lower during lactation than at the end of pregnancy. Interestingly, in this study no change was observed in the serum level of nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) during lactation. Blood chloride level decreased during lactation, whereas a significant increase of calcium occurred during lactation compared with the last few weeks of pregnancy. The authors concluded that metabolic adjustment is completed within the first week or two after parturition in alpacas. Lactational anestrus is rarely seen in alpacas and lamas. However, follicular wave dynamics and the quality of the corpus luteum may be affected particularly in thin animals.",

Milk composition is not affected by stage of lactation and lactation number. Llama milk has a higher content in calcium and lower content in sodium, chloride, and potassium.53 Trace mineral content is similar to that of ruminant milk. Alpaca milk composition was described in two locations (Andean high plateau [AHP] and Patagonia [P]).56 Fat content was lower in both colostrum and milk in the P region compared with those in the AHP region. Overall mean fat content in milk was 3.8 \u00b1 0.6 and 2.6 \u00b1 0.5 for the AHP and P regions, respectively. Lactose content for alpaca milk was 4.4 \u00b1 0.5 and 5.2 \u00b1 0.5 for the AHP and P regions, respectively.56 These regional differences in milk constituents were attributed by the authors to a difference in pasture quality and the energy expenditure from walking.",
