The COVID-19 has induced substantial number of deaths in all continents, although it appears that Europe and the US in North America are the hardest hit areas so far. The response of the medical profession to the challenge was fast and heroic, but a large part of the responsibility for containment lies in the policy makers who are forced to take critical decisions with limited factual information. Predictions about the immediate future spreading of the epidemic and the resulting fatalities vary wildly depending critically on models used and parameters estimated though the models. Thus, it would be helpful for the immediate understanding of the epidemic evolution to resort, to the extent possible, to data driven estimates [2,3]. The present analysis is based on the fact that we have already significant, quantitative knowledge on the COVID-19 spread dynamics and this comes from China. In China the virus appeared on December 23, 2019 in the Wuhan region and after its fast-initial spreading, strict rules of social distancing were imposed almost a month later. It appears that now, approximately three months after the initially reported cases, the spreading in China has subsided. It is noteworthy, that most countries in the world eventually applied strict or milder rules for social distancing in the spirit of China. It is thus fair to say, that most countries, in one way or the other, expect and definitely hope to follow the China pattern with a minimal loss of life.",

We use China in the sense that we analyze the distribution of the daily reported numbers of infected persons as a function of time and find that, with the exception of some outliers, it follows a Gaussian function. Armed with this knowledge and given the fact that most countries follow more or less the Chinese approach of social distancing, we assume the evolution will be similarly qualitatively Gaussian, although clearly with differences. The latter will be reflected in three parameters of the individual country distribution, viz. its mean, standard deviation and peak value; we thus surmise that these three numbers specify the details of the virus spreading in each country. Based on this assumption we fit through a simulated annealing-like process available country data and obtain a full predicted evolution of the spreading in each country. Since the China-derived Gaussian evolution is critical for this work, we employ additionally a standard SIR infection model and derive a similar dependence. The simple predictive method we use in this work has appealing features: it is easy to implement, uses specific prior knowledge, i.e. that of China and the SIR model and being data driven it provides specificity.",

These three curves demonstrate to some extent the degree of uncertainty of the predicted values and horizon. We observe that an effective curve flattening has occurred in Greece while both the UK and the USA seem to be on the infection rise with the latter to be approaching a sharp maximum. It is noteworthy that based on this analysis Italy, Spain and the Netherlands seem to have passed the highest point of infection while Greece, France, and Germany are about to pass it as well.",

Although this trend is data-driven we show here that it may be justified in the context of the standard SIR model. In the latter, in a fixed population of individuals we denote with S, I and R, the Susceptible, Infected and Recovered or Removed percentages of persons involved in the infection. Clearly S+I+R=1. The model is defined with two equations for the susceptible and infected individuals since the third equation follows from the sum constraint. We have(1)dSdt=\u2212aSI\n(2)dIdt=aSI\u2212\u03bcI where \u03b1, \u03bc are the infection and recovery rates respectively. In Eq. (1) the time derivative is always negative and thus the susceptible population always decreases. On the other hand, from Eq. (2) the condition for flattening of the infection growth where the derivative is zero happens at a critical susceptible number, i.e. for Sc=\u03bc/\u03b1. While S > Sc the infected population grows, reaches a maximum at S=Sc and subsequently decays to zero and the infection ends with all individuals either recovered or actually removed from the population.",

The value of \u03bc on the other hand controls the rate at which the individuals do not participate any more in the infection process; large values of \u03bc result in a very fast decay of the infection. A typical evolution is shown in Fig. 4\na where the infected population is seen to grow fast reach a maximum and subsequently have a relatively slow decay.

When, for instance in the model we start with a given value of the infection parameter and measures of social distancing are introduced, the value of the infection parameter is reduced. While a more general analysis can be done easily [5], we focus here in one specific case that is relevant to the form of application of measures for the COVID-19 pandemic. In Fig. 4b, we show the time evolution for the case where measures of social distancing where applied gradually and kept until the end of the pandemic. We see that the actual time evolution of the infected population is not only distinctly Gaussian but, more importantly, there is not even a damped recurrency of the infection. It is noteworthy that this rather optimistic scenario of measure imposition that gradually decrease social distancing and thus the infection rate, is what approximately happened in most countries. We quantify the correlation between the infection curve and the fitted Gaussian function using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) that measures the statistical relationship between two curves (PCC = -1 means perfectly anti-correlated curves, PCC = 0 non-correlated and PCC = 1 perfectly correlated curves). In the case without measures the PCC between the curve of the infection and the fitted Gaussian equals 0.964, while with measures is equal to 0.998 indicating an almost perfect match between the two curves.",

We note that the imposition of gradual social distancing through a linear drop in the infection rate leads, to lowest order, to a linear drop in the susceptible population. Assuming thus a dependence of the form S(t)=\u03b3\u2212\u03b2t, where \u03b2, \u03b3 appropriate constants (to lowest order) and substituting this form to Eq. (2) we obtain a solution of the latter that is basically Gaussian, i.e(3)I(t)=Ice\u2212\u03b1\u03b22t2+(\u03b1\u03b3\u2212\u03bc)t where Ic the initial infection rate at time negatively large for the present form of the solution.

            "text": "The analysis presented is based on the historical behavior of the COVID-19 spreading in China with its resulting Gaussian evolution hypothesis as well as the available data of infected persons in eight countries. It gives an estimate of the infection horizon in each country as well as the expected number of infected persons. While in countries like Greece that imposed early strict rules of social distancing the infected numbers are relatively low, in other countries such as the UK or the USA we see much larger numbers and different recovery horizons. Further analysis with a complete list of countries will be presented elsewhere [5]. We find empirically that the China virus infection follows a Gaussian in time evolution. Although this feature appears initially to be at odds with the simple SIR model, it nevertheless follows from it when gradual social distancing measures are imposed. Furthermore, provided the gradual measure imposition is retained, the mathematical model does not predict an infection recurrence. The difference in the behavior among countries based on the available infection data is reflected in the values of the fitted parameters for the individual countries\u2019 distributions. While the data-driven model appears to work reasonably well with most countries, it seems that in the present phase of the infection it is not as close to the peak dynamics in the US and perhaps UK. This might be related to the different approaches in social distancing measures taken by both countries. The ultimate success or failure of this model will be judged in due time when relevant conclusions can be drawn with more certainty. We hope that this work gives just an upper limit in the behavior of the COVID-19 pandemic since other factors such as ambient temperature rise, increase in the available medical support and change of human behavior will hopefully assist in the faster containment of the spreading. We believe that once the pandemic is over useful policy conclusions can be drawn from the successes and failures of the present model.",
