More recently another nucleoside analogue, galidesivir\n(3, BCX443015), has entered\nclinical development.

The majority\nof the library compounds were nucleosides that contained a cyclic\nmodified ribose or \u201cribose-like\u201d core. These nucleosides\nwere also predominantly N-nucleosides. Less than\n10% of the library comprised nucleoside phosphonates or acyclic analogues\ndue to the limited success, to date, in identifying potent RNA virus\ninhibitors with these types of analogs. A second key factor in the\nlibrary assembly was that approximately 50% of the library included\nmonophosphate and ester prodrugs to capture analogs that may be missed\nin cellular screens due to either poor permeability or inefficient\nmetabolism in the respective cell types that the different antiviral\nassays utilize. Nucleoside analogs require activation by intracellular\nnucleoside/tide kinases to generate their respective nucleoside triphosphate\n(NTP) metabolites in order to then compete with endogenous natural\nnucleotide pools for incorporation into the replicating viral RNA.17 The first phosphorylation step to generate the\nnucleoside monophosphate is often rate limiting, and therefore the\napplication of monophosphate prodrugs, especially phosphoramidates\n(ProTides), has been extensively explored in nucleoside analogs to\nbypass this initial phosphorylation step.18 A notable example includes the phosphoramidate prodrug Sofosbuvir\n(5) for the treatment of HCV (Figure 1).19 Nucleoside\nphosphonate analogs are bioisosteres of the monophosphates but also\nrequire prodrugs to enable masking of the charged phosphonate acid\nthereby allowing more efficient entry into cells. A recent example\nof an approved drug in this class is the phosphonamidate prodrug tenofovir\nalafenamide (6) for the treatment of HIV.20 In both examples the amidate prodrugs effectively\ndeliver high levels of triphosphate (diphosphophosphonate in the case\nof nucleoside phosphonates) inside the target cells and demonstrate\nsignificant improvements in potency compared to their respective parent\nnucleos(t)ides when screened in antiviral assays.20,21",

An alternate method for estimating the\ninhibitory properties of an NTP for its viral target is to measure\nthe NTP levels inside cells following incubation with the parent or\nprodrug compound at a given concentration and then calculate the NTP\nlevels at the EC50 measured in the same cells.17 For example, in a continuous 72 h incubation\nof 1 \u03bcM 4a, the 4tp levels were measured\nat 2, 24, 48, and 72 h, and reached a Cmax of 300, 110, and 90 pmol/million cells in macrophages, HMVEC, and\nHeLa cells lines, respectively. The several-fold difference in maximum 4tp levels is not unusual and reflects the differences between\ncells with respect to their ability to break down the prodrug and\nsubsequently metabolize the released monophosphate to the active 4tp.

The selective inhibition of the viral polymerases\nvs host polymerases is considered a key factor in the development\nof a safe and effective nucleoside antiviral.30,31 Therefore, 4tp was evaluated toward several host polymerases\nand was found to be a weak incorporator toward mitochondrial polymerase\n(POLRMT) and not a substrate for DNA polymerase \u03b3, as would\nbe expected given the presence of the ribose 2\u2032 OH (Table 2).

This suggests\nthe lack of activity for 2\u2032-\u03b2-methyl analogs toward EBOV\nand RSV and retained potency toward HCV is likely due to steric constraints\nin the polymerase active site. Consistent with the model, EBOV and\nRSV both have the E709 or equivalent residue, and 13tp was found to be significantly less active (IC50 >\n30\n\u03bcM) toward RSV.",

Intravenous administration\nof 4b in rhesus monkeys demonstrated rapid elimination\nof prodrug and appearance of parent nucleoside in systemic circulation\n(Figure 4a). However, 4b also rapidly distributed to peripheral blood mononuclear\ncells (PBMCs) and triphosphate levels in PBMCs were elevated to a\nmaximum within 2 h (Figure 4b). A dose of 10 mg/kg resulted in an estimated PBMC triphosphate\nlevel at 24 h that was several-fold higher than the estimated IC50 of 5 \u03bcM for EBOV, with a half-life of 14 h similar\nto that measured in vitro in human macrophages. The long intracellular\nhalf-life of 4tp supported once-daily iv administration\nin the rhesus efficacy study and in the clinical program.",

            "text": "Preclinical in vivo efficacy for 4b was conducted\nin an EBOV-infected rhesus challenge model. The overall strategy was\nto determine a maximally efficacious dose of 4b that\ncould be safely administered and to understand whether delayed time\nof treatment would be effective, a property that was considered critical\nfor the successful clinical application of 4b. These\nstudies have recently been published in full and will only be summarized\nhere.17 The starting dose of 3 mg/kg iv\nwas modeled based on the 4tp levels in rhesus PBMCs following\n10 mg/kg iv dosing to have the potential for inhibiting Ebola viral\nreplication in vivo. A correlation of the in vitro antiviral activity\nand intracellular metabolism described earlier suggested the 3 mg/kg\ndose would produce 4tp levels that exceed the estimated\nIC50 for most of the dosing interval. Compound 4b was dosed iv at 3 mg/kg on day 0 or day 2 relative to EBOV inoculation,\nand continued once daily for 12 days. Systemic viremia was reduced\nand survival out to day 28 postinfection was improved. Animals administered\n3 mg/kg 4b, starting at day 0, had a survival rate of\n33% while those initiated on day 3 had a 66% survival at 28 days.\nThese encouraging data were then followed with a second study in which\none arm explored dosing initiation on day 3 with 10 mg/kg daily for\n12 days to assess whether increased dose compared to the 3 mg/kg result\ncould be more efficacious. Two other arms explored an initial loading\ndose of 10 mg/kg on day 2 or day 3, followed by 11 3 mg/kg daily maintenance\ndoses. All of the animals in the two arms in which 4b treatments were initiated on day 3 (n = 12 total)\nsurvived through day 28, the end of study. In the daily 10 mg/kg dosed\ngroup the effect on viremia was consistently greater than in any of\nthe other groups and was below the limit of quantitation (8 \u00d7\n104 RNA copies mL\u20131) in four of the six\nanimals on days 5 and 7 relative to the vehicle-treated control in\nwhich the geometric mean exceeded 109 copies mL\u20131 at these time points. These data established the effectiveness of 4b in treatment of EVD in NHPs and accelerated its progress\ninto clinical development. In addition to the efficacy studies, distribution\nstudies in cynomolgus monkeys using [14C]4b at the same effective dose of 10 mg/kg established the presence\nof drug-related products in the potential sanctuary sites for the\nvirus including testes, epididymis, eyes, and brain.17 At 4 h postdose, the drug levels in the testes and epididymis\nexceeded those observed in plasma, and even at 168 h postdose detectable\nlevels of drug-related products were still observed in the testes.\nExposure levels in the brain were lower than other tissues, including\nplasma at 4 h, but were detectable above the plasma levels at 168\nh indicating a long half-life of exposure in brain relative to plasma.\nThese data supported the potential that 4b treatment\nmay also reduce persistence of virus in these sanctuary sites.",
