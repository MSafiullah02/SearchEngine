            "text": "This review focuses on heteroleptic copper(I) phenanthroline and some selected diimine complexes because of their eminent role in coordination-based molecular machines. The reason for this exceptional standing is three-fold: (a) among the large amount of thermodynamically strong metal complexes, the copper-phenanthroline interaction is highly labile, thus allowing motion-based devices via rate-determining metal-ligand dissociation. (b) Moreover, several strategies are known (vide infra) that allow the clean preparation of heteroleptic complexes, which is a key prerequisite for structurally diverse molecular machinery. (c) Since NMR characterization is imperative, the diamagnetic nature is another factor suggesting use of copper(I) ions. We are grateful to Jean-Pierre Sauvage for initiating the field and providing continued inspiration over several decades through the demonstration of fascinating copper(I)-based catenane and rotaxane machines [1].",

Moreover their preparation is facilitated by the template effect [2] as impressively demonstrated by Sauvage in 1983. Over the years this method has developed into a highly successful strategy for preparing copper(I) phenanthroline-based catenanes (Fig. 1\n), and several other types of interlocked molecule, such as rotaxanes [3], molecular knots [4] etc., equally became accessible by this approach. In the 80s and early 90s, control and variation of the topological outcome was a main focus of Sauvage\u2019s work [5]. In particular for the fabrication of knots, a series of fascinating designs were developed, but throughout this work the lability of copper(I) phenanthroline complexes was not used for machine-type of motions, rather only to remove the copper for preparing the metal-free structures.",

The electrochemically triggered swinging in the [Cu(phen)2]+-based [2]-catenate [Cu(1)]+ (Fig. 2\n) relies on the different coordination preferences of copper(I) vs. copper(II) and follows a four-step mechanism. First, the stable tetracoordinated copper(I) complex [[4]Cu(1)]+ is oxidized to the intermediate tetrahedral species [[4]Cu(1)]2+. However, since this complex contains the copper(II) ion in a thermodynamically less favorable tetracoordination, it undergoes a full reorganization to afford the stable pentacoordinate complex [[5]Cu(2)]2+. Upon reduction, the pentacoordinate [[5]Cu(2)]+ is formed as a transient state. Now the copper(I) center is embedded in a thermodynamically unfavorable coordination setting and thus undergoes a structural change that regenerates the initial complex [[4]Cu(1)]+. Notably, the rate constant for the forward mechanical motion is far less than that for the backward process [6].",

Copper(I) phenanthroline-based rotaxanes have been made using an analogous template approach and both motions, shuttling and pirouetting, have been demonstrated by several groups [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. The first example, with the macrocycle moving along the thread [12], was reported by Sauvage in 1997, while the pirouetting rotaxane was developed in 1999 [13]. Pirouetting of a macrocycle around its axle upon oxidation of copper(I) proved to be a faster process in general than the translation of a macrocycle along a molecular thread.",

            "text": "An advanced machinery based on dimeric transition metal-based [2]rotaxanes, so called molecular muscles, was first introduced in 2000 [14]. The clever design of this landmark development by Sauvage is based on two identical parts that glide along each other under the action of a chemical signal (Fig. 4\n). The resultant contraction/extension mimics the mode of operation of a muscle. Capitalizing on the switching behavior in simple catenane- and rotaxane-based switches, copper(I) ions were used to construct the doubly threaded [2]rotaxane dimer [Cu2(7)2]2+ that is able to ingest two more metal ions, either in a four- or five-coordinate geometry (Fig. 5\n). As redox initiation, i.e. Cu+ \u21cc Cu2+, failed to initiate the desired motion, the rearrangement was induced by metal exchange as shown schematically in Fig. 5. Since copper(I) prefers the four-coordinate complexation in [[4]Cu2(7)2]2+, the endotopic phenanthroline in the macrocycle of the first unit 7 is bound via copper(I) to the non-macrocyclic phenanthroline unit of the opposing second 7. This binding mode corresponds to an extended geometry (Fig. 5). Upon addition of zinc(II) followed by removal of copper(I) the five-coordinate situation prevails in [[5]Zn2(8)2]4+ that corresponds to the interaction of both zinc ions with one endotopic phenanthroline and one open-chain terpyridine (terpy) unit of the opposing unit. This state corresponds to a contracted geometry (Fig. 5). The change in length due to contraction/extension is roughly the same as that found in natural muscles (\u224827%). This amazing case constitutes the first example of a unimolecular linear array that is able to elongate and contract under the action of a given chemical input, later followed by other cases [15], but unfortunately the authors did not undertake any rate measurements of the contraction/extension process.",

            "text": "So far, the overall nanomechanical motion has been successfully instigated by cleaving coordinative bonds, but in detail the mechanistic scenario depends decisively on the mode of initiation. For instance, when using redox actuation, typically the copper(I) center in the rotaxane is oxidized (Fig. 6\n, left), with the consequence that the Cu[4](phen)LL\u23222+ unit (LL\u2322= any chelate ligand) is cleaved to [Cu(phen)]2+ and LL\u2322, and the macrocyclic [Cu(phen)]2+ shifts to another coordination site on the thread with higher thermodynamic stability. Dissociation or nucleophile-assisted dissociation of LL\u2322 will constitute the rate-determining step. In case of chemical input(s) the situation is quite different. The added metal ion will first coordinate to the vacant tridentate site of the thread, then the macrocycle will move without metal ion to the new coordination site (Fig. 6, middle). Here, the coordinative bond cleavage has to take place on the stage of Cu[4](phen)LL\u2322+. Another possibility arises when the demetalation is initiated prior to addition of the divalent metal (Fig. 6, right). Here the demetalation is rate-determining. Thus depending on the scenario the rate-determining steps are quite distinct and so are the activation parameters. However, as we detail later in Chapter 4.1, all these processes are usually accelerated in the presence of nucleophiles which help to dissociate the departing ligand.",

            "text": "A conceptually atypical dynamic process at copper phenanthroline complexes was designed by Sauvage and his team with an electrochemically triggered wing-flapping motion [16], based on a process studied originally in copper helicates [17]. This motion in [3]rotaxane [Cu2(9)(10)2]2+ is much faster than a similar one when it is based on metal exchange (Fig. 7\n). In the initial state, both copper(I) ions are tetracoordinated despite the availability of five nitrogen donor atoms from the nearby bipyridine (bipy) and terpyridine-like (terpy) binding sites. In contrast, when the metal centers become divalent, such as in copper(II) or zinc(II), the triazole groups are additionally bound to the metal ions (Fig. 7) to enable pentacoordination. Interconversion between the two coordination environments entails a notable angle change at both triazole rings, which is reminiscent of a wing-flapping movement similar to that of birds. The mechanistic scenario is different for both modes of actuation. When zinc(II) is added to [[4]Cu2(9)(10)2]2+, it has to displace the copper(I), which means that all four N \u2192 copper(I) bonds have to break on the way to [[5]Zn2(9)(10)2]4+. In contrast, electrochemical actuation does not require any (in the oxidation step) or only one coordination bond (in the reduction step) to be broken. Therefore this movement is one of the fastest motions induced in copper-diimine complexes of interlocked systems.",

The authors have prepared this structure as a large ring containing alternately two bidentate (phen) and tridentate (terpy) ligand sites (Fig. 8\n). Based on the coordination preference of metal ions, the macrocyclic ligand can be reversibly toggled between two states by applying electrochemical or chemical stimuli. Treatment of 11 with copper(I) ions furnished an intramolecular [Cu(phen)2]+ complex, [[4]Cu(11)]+. In contrast, removal of copper(I) and addition of iron(II) ions afforded the octahedral bisterpyridine complex [Fe(terpy)2]2+, [[6]Fe(12)]2+. This exchange entails major geometric changes. The height of complex [[6]Fe(12)]2+ measured as distance at the tridentate ligands is only \u223c11 \u00c5, whereas it is almost three times larger for [Cu(11)]+. Importantly, the two figure-of-eight structures of [Cu(11)]+/2+ can be reversibly toggled by applying electrochemical stimuli and thus be of convenient use for the contraction/extension of oligomers or polymers. The oxidized species [[4]Cu(11)]2+ rearranged within several tens of seconds to the hexa-coordinated copper complex [[6]Cu(12)]2+. A full kinetic investigation, however, was not undertaken.",

For this purpose, catenanes and rotaxanes have been attached to surfaces revealing some promising properties [19].

The group of Sauvage tried to resolve the kinetics of N,NLL\u2322\u2192([Cu(phen))]+/2+ bond cleavage of surface-bound rotaxanes and catenanes (Fig. 9\n) [20], [21].

Early conformational switches based on the syn vs. anti orientation of extended bipyridines [22] thus have been elegantly exploited for allosteric receptors, originally by Beer [23] and later by L\u00fctzen et al. [24], [25], in both cases by (de)complexing the bipyridine in a heteroleptic manner to a metal ion fragment. Intramolecular complexation between two bipyridine sites was utilized by Koert et al. for conformational signal transduction [26], by Branda et al. for allosteric inhibition [27], by Kr\u00e4mer et al. for allosteric regulation of catalytic activity [28] and Haberhauer et al. for opening and closing a chiral hinge [29]. Even more impressively the syn-anti conformational change at bipyridine was used to drive a chirality pendulum (see Fig. 10\n). Upon metal-ion addition (Cu2+, Zn2+) the arms of the pendulum did swing from one configuration to the other: in the metal-free state the chiral scaffold enforces P-configuration of the pendulum arms, while in presence of metal ions the M-configuration dominates [30].",

For opening of the diimine copper(I) coordinative bonds in [[4]Cu(18)]+, the nanoswitch was reacted with cyclam which entailed a toggling of the switching arm onto the zinc porphyrin (ZnPor) station. Incidentally, when irradiated at 419 nm, the copper complex is photochemically active transferring triplet energy to cis-17 which readily isomerizes to trans-17, whereas 18 (switching State I) is unable to support the photoisomerization (Fig. 11\n) [32].

After addition of one equiv. of copper(I) ions to switch 24 the arm moved from the ZnPor station to the newly copper(I)-filled phenanthroline site resulting in formation of complex [[4]Cu(24)]+ (although a terpyridine is involved, the copper is only tetracoordinated). Addition of one equiv. of 25 generated an intermolecular copper complex [[4]Cu(24)(25)]+ which causes the arm to shift back to the ZnPor site. The next two additions repeated the same toggling protocol at the second arm carrying a phenanthroline terminus. The toggling could be properly followed at the Q band of the zinc porphyrin unit (Fig. 15\n).",

Due to the same reason as stated above, the o-isomer is highly favored after one- or two-electron oxidation. In the initial state, i.e. [Cu(31)(33)]+, there is only a slight preference for the i-isomer (K\ni\n/\no = 0.44). After one-electron oxidation, o-[Cu(31)(33)]2+ is formed with the electron being removed from the copper center as indicated by the anisotropic EPR signal. As a consequence of redox potentials, however, it is clear that initially the ferrocenyl group of the i-isomer is oxidized. After pyrimidine rotation the one-electron transfer redox potentials (copper(I)/(II) vs ferrocene/ferrocenium) are reversed triggering electron transfer from copper to ferrocene. For the three-component redox-active rotor, Kume and Nishihara optimized the rotational speed (inversion) by changing the steric preferences of the i-isomer using different groups adjacent to the pyrimidine nitrogen [50], [51]. In combination with the diphosphine ligand 34 (Fig. 18), complex [Cu(32)(34)]+ exhibited mechanical bistability, which led to dual luminescence [52]. The inversion dynamics was found to depend on temperature and solvent. Rate constants for i \u2192 o-inversion were determined at 293 K in CDCl3 (k = 20 s\u22121), acetone (k = 70 s\u22121) and CD3CN (k = 120 s\u22121).",

Quantitative formation of the [2]pseudorotaxane ([Cu(36)(37)]+) is guided by negative cooperative effects. Upon reduction of 3,6-bis(5-methyl-2-pyridine)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine (37) as the thread, an intermolecular self-sorting takes place furnishing the [3]pseudorotaxane [Cu2(36)2(37)]+.

The bimolecular reaction rate is sensitive to the denticity of the ligand (k\nf (37) = 12000 M\u22121 s\u22121), but not to electronic factors. In contrast, the reverse switching is a unimolecular dissociative process, which is consistent with a supramolecular de-threading-threading reaction (k\nb = 50 s\u22121).

As a result, any stronger binding monodentate ligand will replace the solvent molecule(s).

Rate measurements on five-component rotors with brake stones in their trajectory [62], however, do not allow conclusions to be drawn on the cleavage step. We thus focus our report on four-component rotors where the exchange rate has been varied by using rotators with one, two, or three pyridyl terminals [63]. By increasing the number of pyridyl terminals the activation energy for rotation increases and thus the rotational speed decreases as anticipated by thermodynamic considerations (Fig. 23\n). Remarkably it is not only the N\npy \u2192 [Cu(PhenAr2)]+ coordinative bond, but also a good amount of dispersive attraction that has to be overcome in the rate-determining step. The dispersive attraction arises from interaction of the pyridine terminals and the large aryl substituents in the 2,9-positions of the phenanthroline stations. Furthermore, angular strain in rotors also plays a role as strain release in the departure step will lower the barrier. Considering the complexity of the rotational exchange process that is influenced by strain in the rotor, dispersive and coordinative interactions, angular restrictions in the departure step and solvent interferences (vide infra) the quantitative assessment of all contributors to the dynamics is still limited.",

Whereas self-sorting in stand-alone devices and machines can usually be solved with two or three orthogonal interactions, the design of machinery requires to handle orthogonality during various stages of communication and action so that a high level of command (= degree of self-sorting) is needed [41]. For a crisp description of machinery we will identify the number of (a) components and (b) functions. The number of components specifies all distinct molecular entities that have to be amalgamated to ascertain reversible operation of the machinery, while the \u201cfunction\u201d counts individual functional units whose action is synchronized.",

The interaction of all components has to be harmonized when reversibly driving the machinery in the ON or OFF mode of catalysis. Looking from a different angle, the overall system links together two functional units, the nanoswitch and the catalyst.

In CH2Cl2, nanoswitch 48 is locked with its arm on the ZnPor unit (state I). Toggling to State II is achieved by addition of copper(I) ions and 2,9-dianthrylphenanthroline (31) (1 equiv. each), because formation of the bulky intermolecular HETPHEN complex [Cu(31)(48)]+ at the bipyridine subunit is sterically incompatible with binding of the azabipyridine arm to the ZnPor unit.",

Therefore, intermolecular attachment of piperidine in State I is rather weak (log K = 2.4). This binding difference can be used for ON/OFF switching of a catalyzed Knoevenagel reaction (conditions: 55 \u00b0C, 30 min, in CDCl3). While in State II, piperidine is strongly bound and catalysis is prevented (OFF state of catalysis), the addition of one equiv. of cyclam (26) removes the copper(I) from [Cu(31)(48)(49)]+ generating the self-locked nanoswitch 48. As a result, piperidine is released into solution, where it catalyzes the Knoevenagel reaction affording 23% of product 52. The ON/OFF cycle was repeated three times without loss of activity [64]. In some ways, this switching protocol simulates the action of the calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) [65], the latter also being a self-locked system. To activate the enzyme, the inhibitory arm detaches from the active site after being wrapped up by a Ca2+-loaded calmodulin.",

In Netstate I, the copper(I) ions are exclusively self-sorted on switch 62 while upon one-electron oxidation of the ferrocenyl unit in 62, a novel self-sorting reshuffles the copper(I) ions into the phenanthroline site of switch [Cu(23)]+ (NetState II). Reduction with decamethylferrocene (64) causes the copper(I) ions to translocate back, resetting NetState I. The translocations in forward (4 min at rt) and backward (1 min at rt) direction are rather fast. For catalytic action, NetState II is utilized to deactivate piperidine (49) at the ZnPor unit in [Cu(23)]+ (log K = 5.37 \u00b1 0.41) [36] whereas in NetState I piperidine is released into solution as it is only weakly bound to 23 (log K = 2.66 \u00b1 0.08). Indeed, in NetState I, the liberated catalyst 49 catalyzes the Knoevenagel addition between aldehyde 50 and diethylmalonate (51) generating product 52 in 26% yield in the first ON cycle, but only 20% in the second ON cycle. From various mechanistic investigations the conclusion was drawn that the oxidative conditions cause partial decomposition of the catalyst and thus reduce the yield in the second ON state [67].",

The most comprehensive kinetic studies on exchange reactions of copper(I) diimine complexes were performed by Geier in acetone, acetonitrile and solvent mixtures using direct methods [72]. A few relevant rate constants from this study are given in Table 1\n; they may serve as a crude lead. Accordingly, the ligand exchange reaction [Cu(diimine)2]+ + diimine\u2032 \u2192 [Cu(diimine)(diimine\u2032)]+ + diimine occurs at a bimolecular rate constant of ca. 103 M\u22121 s\u22121 at 25 \u00b0C. Thus, at 1 mM of diimine\u2032 the lifetime of the exchange reaction would be as short as 1 s. Solvent assistance in diimine displacement reactions was confirmed with several nucleophilic solvents; the rate constant for exchanging 2,2\u2032-biquinoline (67) by MeCN is 1 \u00d7 102 M\u22121 s\u22121 at 25 \u00b0C; in pure MeCN the lifetime is thus only 5 ms. Most remarkable is the accelerating effect of iodide that should allow catalysis of ligand exchange if used in sub-stoichiometric amounts, a concept that has remarkably not been applied with molecular copper(I) complex-based machinery. Indeed, both steps, i.e. iodide association and dissociation are extremely fast reactions. Iodide used at a concentration of >3.2 mM should outperform acetonitrile as solvent [72]!",

Whereas at 300 K and in d2-TCE as a non-coordinating solvent the process was very slow (k\n300 = 6.3 \u00d7 10\u22126 s\u22121), it could be greatly accelerated by acetonitrile and upon heating. At higher temperature autocatalysis seems to play a role, possibly because racemization is then additionally driven by an SN2-type process due to the presence of dissociated ligand. More detailed data about solvent effects was gained from ligand exchange studies at bis(imino-pyridine) copper(I) complexes in dicopper(I) helicates [81]: in acetone\u2011d\n6\nk = (1.6\u20131.8) \u00d7 10\u22126 s\u22121 (t\n1/2 = 110\u2013120 h), in dichloromethane\u2011d\n2\nk = 4.9 \u00d7 10\u22126 s\u22121 (t\n1/2 = 40 h), and in acetonitrile\u2011d\n3\nk > 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 s\u22121 (t\n1/2 < 5 min) [82]. Thus acetonitrile leads to an acceleration of three orders of magnitude. As similar range was found for the inversion in a double-stranded helicate with ketimine-bridged tris(bipyridine) ligands [83].

The first example [6], published in 1994, exemplified how electrochemical input leads to a swing from a tetracoordinated bisphenanthroline copper(I) complex in [2]-catenate [[4]Cu(1)]+ to the pentacoordinate phenanthroline terpyridine copper(II) complex in catenate [[5]Cu(2)]2+ (see Fig. 2). By EPR it was demonstrated that the oxidation of [[4]Cu(1)]+ generates the copper(II) complex as a metastable species in a pseudo-tetrahedral configuration, i.e. [[4]Cu(1)]2+. Electrochemical and chemical oxidation allowed determination of the kinetics of the forward and backward process. The [[4]Cu(1)]2+ \u2192 [[5]Cu(2)]2+ transformation in CH3CN occurred at k\nf = 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 s\u22121 (20 \u00b0C; t\n\u00bd = 9.6 h), while the reverse transformation [[5]Cu(2)]+ \u2192 [[4]Cu(1)]+ happened at k\nb = 1 s\u22121 (t\n\u00bd = 0.7 s) [6].

The case of a shuttle (Fig. 32\n), i.e. [[4]Cu(5)]+, was studied at 25 \u00b0C in pure acetonitrile alike [[4]Cu(1)]+. The process of [[4]Cu(5)]2+ \u2192 [[5]Cu(6)]2+ operates at k\n298 = 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 s\u22121; at a half-life of t\n\u00bd = 1.4 h the motion is a little bit faster than that in [[4]Cu(1)]2+\n[12]. The kinetics of the reverse reaction, i.e. the [[5]Cu(6)]+ \u2192 [[4]Cu(5)]+ reorganization, was not determined exactly, but it was approximated from the electrochemical data as 10\u22124 s\u22121 \u2264 k\n298 \u2264 10\u22122 s\u22121. The pentacoordinated species [[5]Cu(6)]+ thus has a minimum lifetime of 69 s (Fig. 32). This is a remarkable increase as compared to [[5]Cu(2)]+ \u2192 [[4]Cu(1)]+. This difference was assigned by the authors to a reduced steric shielding about the metal center in the [[5]Cu]2+ rotaxane against external reagents than in the catenane, indicating that acetonitrile may play an important role in the rate determining metal-ligand bond dissociation. This shuttling between two different sites was much slower than then the degenerate exchange seen in one of Stoddart\u2019s catenane (k = 101 s\u22121 at 13.5 \u00b0C) which required the dissociation of a cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene)/ hydroquinone complex in the rate-determining step [84].",

Direct kinetic information on copper translocation between two nanoswitches was gained from inverting the self-sorting preference after redox activation [95]. Upon treatment with one equiv. of copper(I) ions, the 1:1 mixture of 18 and 85 (see Fig. 39\n) ended up as a 97:3 ensemble of [Cu(18)]+ and [Cu(85)]+. Upon addition of a one-electron oxidant, the resultant copper(II) ions self-sorted anew generating a 1:99 mixture of [Cu(18)]2+ and [Cu(85)]2+, the latter stabilizing the copper(II) ions in a pentacoordinated environment (state II). Unfortunately, attempts to follow the kinetics of Cu2+ translocation were unsuccessful. Alternatively, the reaction [Zn(18)]2+ + 85 \u2192 18 + [Zn(85)]2+ was followed kinetically (25 \u00b0C, k\n298 = 4.3 \u00d7 10\u22123 s\u22121, t\n1/2 = 161 s). Since metal translocation was zero order in the concentration of the receiver nanoswitch 85, the rate-limiting step most likely involves opening of the zinc-loaded nanoswitch prior to metal ion transfer. The reverse process, however, could be monitored with copper being transmitted. Upon combining switch 18 with [Cu(85)]+, the copper(I) ion translocation occurred with a halftime t\n1/2 = 102 s at 25 \u00b0C (k\n298 = 6.8 \u00d7 10\u22123 s\u22121, CH2Cl2) producing [Cu(18)]+ and 85\n[95].",

As with any other examples, though, the rate constant will again depend on the individual mechanistic scenario, which often is not rigorously elucidated. Equally, none of the studies has systematically sought to investigate the influence of nucleophiles on rates although reports from three decades ago already clearly indicated that this is an important factor [72]. Kume\u2019 and Nishihara\u2019s analysis of the tristate rotor [Cu(31)(35)]+ (Fig. 41\n) resulted in rate constants in the order of 4\u201340 s\u22121 that were assigned to a single N\npy \u2192 [Cu(phen)]+ bond cleavage, because the mechanism should involve rotation of the pyridine or the pyrimidine ring about the pyridine-pyrimidine axis [53]. In the transition state, the N\npy \u2192 [Cu(phen)]+ bond is cleaved and additionally delocalization between the two orthogonal heterocyclic ring systems is destroyed. Unexpectedly, these rate constants are in the same ball park as those for some of the faster pirouetting and shuttling events in rotaxanes although the latter formally require a rate-determining N,N\nphen \u2192 [[4]Cu(phen)]2+ bond scission.",

While the original expectation was that the barrier of rotation would increase linearly with the number of N\npy \u2192 [Cu(phen)]+ bond cleavage reactions in the rate-determining step, the detailed analysis furnished a much more intricate picture. Contributors to the activation barrier are not only the number of coordinative interactions but also large attractive dispersive forces between the departing pyridine ligands and the large aromatic units in the 2- and 9-positions of the phenanthroline. Another issue of great importance is strain. Depending on the design, the rotors experience full strain release in the departure step. Finally, the presence of spurious traces of nucleophiles is expected to influence the rate. For instance, in most examples, acetonitrile is present, usually due to the use of [Cu(MeCN)4]+ as a source for copper. In those cases, rigorous removal of acetonitrile changed the rates significantly [63]. As such the kinetic data can be influenced by number of contributors.",

While we have focused on the ligand \u2013 copper bond cleavage as the usual rate determining step, a study by Sauvage has revealed surprising insight about the usefulness of intermediate stations for speeding up shuttling [99]. The presence of an intermediate 2,2\u2032-bipyridine group in 90 was claimed to speed up the shuttling of the macrocycle between the phenanthroline and the terpyridine station. At present the effect is not fully understood. The bipyridine group may behave as a real \u201cstation\u201d, hosting the mobile macrocycle for some short time, or its function is merely to modify the nature of the axis. In any case, such observations clearly indicate that long-distance motions on a thread may require the fine-tuning of additional parameters aside of the ligand \u2013 copper bond cleavage (see Fig. 44\n).",

The present survey demonstrates the eminent importance of various dynamic interactions NL \u2192 [Cu(phen)]+ (NL = terpy, phen, py) for equipping molecular devices with motion. The rate constants for each of these interactions vary over a wide range, for instance, in the case of the Npy \u2192 [Cu(phen)]+ interaction the rates differ by >5 orders of magnitude. Clearly, the design of future devices will require additional and more detailed structure\u2013reactivity (= rate) relationships for optimization of nanomechanical machine functions.",
