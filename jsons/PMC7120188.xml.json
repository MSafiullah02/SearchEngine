The fruits are also made into cider, wine, beer, or tea. The Canadian indigenous people used the fruit in soups, stews, meat dishes, dried cakes and in a dried meat preparation called pemmican to which serviceberries are incorporated to impart flavour and to act as preservative. Saskatoon berry juice was used to marinate other foods such as black tree lichen or roots to sweeten them (Turner 1997). The advent of new and innovative \u00admethods of processing, freezing and packaging have greatly increased fruit uses and growers in Canada are promoting it as a superfruit like the berry fruits.",

            "text": "Two cultivars (Thiessen and Smoky) of Saskatoon berries were found to possess free radical scavenging activities in a concentration-dependent manner (Hu et al. 2005). Cultivar Thiessen exhibited higher activity compared to cv. Smoky due to its relatively abundant anthocyanin content. Total anthocyanin content significantly correlated to free radical scavenging activities. It was found that the free radical scavenging components, i.e., anthocyanin, occurred predominantly in the ethyl acetate and n-butanol extracted fractions, suggesting that active components were more likely to occur in glycoside forms. HPLC subsequently confirmed the existence of cyanidin-3-O-galac\u00adtoside and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside as leading anthocyanins in the Saskatoon berries. In addition, Saskatoon berries extracts from both cultivars inhibited peroxy-radical induced intracellular oxidation in a concentration-dependent fashion without affecting cell viability.\nThe polyphenol contents and antioxidant activities were assessed for 17 Saskatoon berry cultivars grown in Canada in fresh and stored fruits at \u221220\u00b0C for 9 months. Of 17 Saskatoon berry cultivars, the Nelson cultivar was the richest in total polyphenol, anthocyanin, and pro\u00adcyanidin contents (801, 382, and 278 mg/100  g fresh weight, respectively) (Bakowska-Barczak and Kolodziejczyk 2008). This cultivar exhibited the highest antioxidant potential measured with DPPH and ABTS radicals (2.8 and 5.0 mM/100 g FW, respectively). Cultivar-dependent changes in polyphenol content were observed after freezer storage at \u221220\u00b0C for 9 months. In the Lee 2 cultivar, significant increases in anthocyanin and flavonol contents occurred, while in the Lee 3 and Martin cultivars considerable decreases were observed. During the freezer storage, the antioxidant activity remained unchanged except for the Smokey which showed to be the most sensitive cultivar during storage. The Nelson and Lee 2 were the most stable cultivars during storage.\nIn the lipid peroxidation inhibitory assay, the anthocyanin mixture at 10 ppm presented activity of 72% compared with 89, 87 and 98% for commercial anti-oxidants butylated hydoxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, and tertbutylhydroxyquinone at 1.67, 2.2 and 1.67 ppm, respectively. At 10 ppm, compounds 1-3 inhibited lipid peroxidation by 70, 75 and 78%, respectively (Adhikari et al. 2005).",
