For example, severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) [1], originating from Guangdong Province, China, then spread around the world along international air travel routes. Influenza A (H1N1) flu [2] in 2009, which was first reported in Mexico, has become a global issue, which is followed by the emergence of avian influenza [3], Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [4], Ebola virus disease [5], Zika [6]. The outbreak of any infectious disease has a great impact on humans, either physically, mentally, or economically. How to forecast and control the global spread of infectious diseases has always been the focus of research. One of effective methods to address this problem is the introduction of metapopulation networks.",

Next, different network structures, including bipartite metapopulation network [8], time-varying metapopulation network [9], local subpopulation structure [10], interconnected metapopulation network [11], have been found to play an essential role in the global spread of infectious diseases. Furthermore, studies have shown that adaptive behavior of individuals contributes to the global spread of epidemics, contrary to willingness [12], [13], [14], [15]. These works mostly focus on large-scale, air-travel-like mobility pattern, without individuals going back to their origins. There are also some studies on recurrent mobility pattern. Balcan and Vespignani investigated invasion threshold on metapopulation network with recurrent mobility pattern [16], [17]. Heterogeneous dwelling time in subpopulations was considered in ref. [18].",

For aviation networks, sometimes there is no any direct flight when people travel, which makes them have to traverse to other places before reaching their destinations. Even in the case of a direct flight, individuals may have to make two or more stops before reaching their destinations. Actually, these two cases reflect the same problem of individual transfer in a metapopulation network. For an emerging infectious disease, taking transfer once as an example, movement of infectious individuals may result in more susceptible subpopulations being infected, since infectious individuals in an infected subpopulation can arrive not only at its neighbors but also the neighbors of its neighbors. To address this problem, we define second neighbor and second-neighbor network (SNN) on an arbitrary undirected network. Then we investigate the spread of an infectious disease on a connected metapopulation network coupled with its SNN and study how indirect flights affect the global spread of the infectious disease. We show that the behavior that individuals travel along the metapopulation network coupled with its SNN contributes to the spread of disease.",

This network can be regarded as a regular network with degree 2 when the number of nodes is large enough. In each panel, we make a comparison among three values of transfer rates: q=0 for no transfer, q=0.5 for half of travelers choosing to transfer, and q=1 for all individuals traveling along the SNN. From Fig. 5, the fractions of infected subpopulations and infectious individuals both increase almost linearly. And the speed of disease transmission when q=0.5 is nearly twice as fast as that of the other two cases. When transmission process reaches a steady state, the fractions of infected subpopulations and infectious individuals when all individuals travel along the SNN are nearly half of that of the other two cases. The reason is obvious. The SNN is not connected and it is composed of two linear subnets (shown in Fig. 6\n). The change in network connectivity hinders the spread of disease to some degree. However, moderate transfer rate does accelerate the transmission of disease. These two results hold for all cases where the metapopulation network is connected while its SNN not. Under these cases, controlling direct flights may limit the spread of disease to a relatively small area.",

As illustrated in Figs. 7\nand 8\n, comparing the left and right panels of these two figures, we find that at the early phase of transmission disease occurs and outbreaks in a small number of subpopulations and infectious individuals increase slowly. When there exist infectious individuals in majority of subpopulations, the fractions of infectious individuals rise sharply and then reach a steady state in a short time. It is easily seen that the behavior of individual transfer accelerates the transmission of disease. Increasing rates of transfer paves the way for infectious individuals transmitting disease to more susceptible subpopulations. However, transfer rate has little effect on the final fraction of infectious individuals, which is consistent with the theoretical results in Section 4.",

In Fig. 8, for power-law networks, moderate transfer rate is most conducive to the spread of infectious diseases. However, when q=1, the speed of transmission is slightly slower than that of q=0.5. Referring to Poisson networks (shown in Fig. 7), along the increase of transfer rate, the speed of spread displays an increase trend, at odds with power-law networks. This is owing to next-nearest degrees. For power-law networks (see Fig. 4(a)), with the number of second neighbors climbs from 4 to 537, weights of links of the SNN gradually decrease, which lower the probability of individuals traveling to second neighbors. In contrast, the distribution of next-nearest degrees for Poisson network is relatively concentrated.",

One is a linear metapopulation network with average degree approximately equaling to 2, and the other two are with the same average degree 7. We find that if the SNN is not connected, controlling direct flights may hinder the spread of disease. On the contrary, if the SNN is also connected, controlling direct flights may accelerate the spread of disease. It is in common that moderate transfer rate contributes to the global spread of infectious diseases. In detail, for a linear network, the numbers of infected subpopulations and infectious individuals increase almost linearly. For a Poisson network, the dominant role is second neighbor because of its relatively homogeneous distribution. However, for the other two networks, moderate transfer rate is most conducive to the spread of infectious diseases, which means that although the existence of second neighbors may promote the global transmission of infectious diseases, the roles played by neighbors are still significant. Therefore, when an infectious disease occurs, the governments should adjust measures to local conditions. That is, if the network connectivity is reduced after controlling direct flights, this measure is effective; otherwise, if the network connectivity keep the same with the original network, this measure fails. It may be more effective to control all flights (direct or indirect) properly.",

Under similar hypotheses, our model can be popularized to the third-neighbor network, the fourth-neighbor network, and so on, and then be applied to high-speed train and rail networks. It is worth noticing that more stops may lead to according change of time scale, such as a general train, whose speed is so slow that it is time-consuming traveling between two places with long distance.",
