High in vitro activity has been found for the nucleotide analogue remdesivir, for the antimalarial drug chloroquine, and for nitazoxanide, a drug used to treat protozoan infections. Because the virus enters human cells by way of the membrane-associated angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), keeping the virus from docking to this receptor is a conceivable treatment approach. Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) plays a role in the fusion of the virus with cells; inhibitors of this enzyme are known as well. The potential therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of these and other active substances remain to be investigated in clinical trials.

There is not yet any recommendation for the therapeutic use of any particular agent beyond standard supportive treatment.

For the new viruses too, ACE2 serves as receptor and thus as entry point to the human body (3, 4) . A crucial part is also played by a serine protease in the host cells: this enzyme, known as transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), enables fusion with the host cell and is thus an important factor in the dissemination of influenza viruses and coronaviruses in the cells of the human body.",

Potential vaccines are directed against the viral proteins. The spike (S) protein is of particular interest as a possible antigen for vaccination, because of its crucial role in viral dissemination. Different types of vaccines can be distinguished: For instance, they can contain inactivated viruses, which induce neutralizing antibodies. A plausible alternative is administration of RNA-or DNA-based vaccines, with nucleic acids coding for the S protein. In these cases, the human organism produces the protein by which an immune response is induced. Subunit vaccines contain the S protein or another viral protein, without carrier virus. However, the immunogenicity is relatively low, so an adjuvant is needed. Vector-based vaccines comprise a protein, e.g., the S protein, that is coupled to nonreplicating carrier virus particles. This concept was pursued in the development of a vaccine for MERS, but no finished vaccine for this coronavirus infection ever became available. In any case, it will take some time until we have a vaccine for COVID-19. It goes without saying that the safety of a vaccine is extremely important (7, 8) .",

As shown in Table 2 , the nucleoside analog penciclovir had a relatively weak effect (EC50: 96 \u00b5M). Favipiravir, licensed for the treatment of influenza in Japan, exhibited moderate activity, as did nafamostat. A striking finding was the relatively high in vitro activity of nitazoxanide, a drug that was developed mainly for the treatment of protozoal infections but also acts against some bacteria and viruses. The highest activity under the experimental conditions described in this publication was displayed by remdesivir, with an EC50 of 0.77 \u00b5M and an EC90 of 1.76 \u00b5M (1 \u00b5M = 0.6 mg/L) (6).",

Six days after the onset of her symptoms, nucleic acid amplification of material from a nasopharyngeal swab demonstrated the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. At the time of hospital admission on day 7, the patient had marked dyspnea at rest (respiration rate: 30 breaths per minute; oxygen saturation: 90% in ambient air) and a chest radiograph showed atypical infiltration of both lungs ( Figure 1A) . Thoracic computed tomography revealed peripheral ground-glass opacities in both lungs, compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia ( Figure 1B) . After the occurrence of COVID-19associated hepatitis on day 12, the clinical and laboratory findings gradually improved with antipyretic and antimicrobial treatment of a bacterial superinfection. ",
