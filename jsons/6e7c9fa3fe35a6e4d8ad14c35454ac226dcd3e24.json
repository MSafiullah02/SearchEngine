The purpose of this article is to describe our response to help providers tasked with caring for isolated populations. This article discusses the method and challenges facing a small surgical team tasked with preparing for and treating the novel infectious disease process, COVID-19.

The military trains and equips medical teams to provide care for these troops in austere locations. Military operations are generally more focused on treating trauma and performing damage control surgery, rather than handling large-scale infectious disease processes. In the authors' team, there is a surgeon, emergency medicine physician, certified nurse anesthetist, intensive care nurse, scrub technician, and a medical planner. The challenge is changing from a damage control team into an infectious disease containment and treatment team. This transition to a new primary medical mission in the face of a pandemic is applicable to any small medical team tasked with taking care of isolated populations.",

Identification of symptoms by either medical or nonmedical personnel is possible. In medical resource-constrained environments, it may be necessary to train nonmedical personnel to perform basic medical functions like screening. Centralized suspected exposure reporting is required, with any suspected individuals calling or reporting to designated locations where medical personnel can don personal protective equipment (PPE) and clinically assess the probability of infection (Fig. 1) .",

Ideally, cohorts of people should enter and be isolated in groups to ensure people entering quarantine together are not potentially contaminated by others entering quarantine later. If others enter the quarantine cohort later, the quarantine duration should reset. Cohort quarantine may not be possible due to limitations in housing and support for multiple individual groups. If possible, entry into the population by new people should be batched based off the duration of required quarantine. For example, with COVID-19, individuals would only be able to join the population every 14 days to allow for the previous quarantined cohort to vacate the segregated infrastructure for quarantined personnel. When this cannot be supported and individuals will join at various dates, the best option we have found is \"restriction of movement.\" 6 During restriction of movement, at-risk populations are segregated only to certain locations at specific times as best as possible, to reduce exposure at communal points such as recreation, hygiene (bathing and toilet), and dining facilities. Particularly high-risk populations (known exposure, travel from high-risk countries, etc) will go into traditional quarantine. Selfmonitoring and personnel tracking are ongoing during restriction of movement, and any signs of infection are immediately reported.",

During a pandemic, there will be significant strain on any evacuation system, both civilian and military. A trigger point must be identified that is early enough to allow for salvage of the patient, but not too early to overstress the evacuation system. For COVID-19, we identified the need for oxygen. On review of published timelines for COVID-19 infections, this provides approximately 1 to 2 days to identify evacuation before a segment of this population develops acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other complications. 7, 8 Factors and challenges that complicate the movement of potential COVID-19 patients include the time needed to move the evacuation platform to the patient, the number of patients needing evacuation, the severity of the patients, the availability of air ambulances or military aircraft, the composition of the en route medical team(s), and the ability to gain overflight and landing approval for emergency landings or stops for fuel along the planned flight. Each leg of the evacuation route must be approved by the host country and may require political engagement with the host nation through Department of State representatives. Exposure risks to clinicians, pilots, and other crew members en route, especially if they have underlying health conditions that predispose them to complications from COVID-19 infection, must factor into planning, especially if they are being transported in an aircraft not normally configured for medical evacuation. Pre-movement intubation and establishment of a deliberate airway may be needed before movement.",

These teams are built for damage control surgery and rapid evacuation and therefore, are not equipped for long-term inpatient care. Other small teams with specific missions may be in a similar situation that requires using equipment and skills for a different purpose. The first step is to inventory all equipment and identify a means of monitoring, supporting, and treating the likely lifethreatening disease process. For COVID-19, respiratory failure is the greatest immediate threat to life. To support this process, a source of oxygen, ventilation, nutrition, and hydration is required. Identify how each requirement can be met, even if it would not be standard in a high resource environment. For example, the authors' team considered that when sedation runs out, emergency cricothyroidotomy kits would be required to serve as tracheostomies. Feeding could be done through open gastric tubes using excess rubber catheters if nasogastric tubes are unavailable. Expected populations to be treated at various severities should be identified, and additional supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE) should be acquired as soon as possible. Finally, a limit to what can be done must be identified and, if required, triage of medical resources needs to be evaluated by the medical team. In our team, we can only provide a maximum of 45% to 50% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) and are limited in means to treat sepsis, multiorgan failure, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). If a patient exceeds the capabilities, resources may have to be shunted to any additional patients who have a more survivable disease process.",

In order to provide the sedation over long periods of time, conservation of resources is required. In our experience, ketamine provides the most concentrated method of sedation. Using a ketamine drip starting at 2.5 mcg/kg/min and titrated to a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) of -1, we avoid the rapid consumption of propofol or benzodiazepine stores.
