In 2009, an outbreak of human metapneumovirus infection was associated with the death of a captive chimpanzee in Chicago, Illinois, USA.

Z oological facilities in North America house endangered species of great apes with annual visitation rates of >100 million persons (1) . Because humans and great apes are related genetically, interspecies transmission of infectious pathogens is a concern.

Cilia were absent from many bronchial epithelial cells, and rare epithelial cells lacked any identifiable cytoplasmic membrane or nuclear structure, suggestive of the smudge cells commonly found in human HMPV infection (6) (Figure 2 ). Only rare gram-positive cocci were observed, and the lack of extensive suppurative inflammation suggested that these findings were not a major contributing factor. Bacterial lung tissue cultures were negative. Lung tissue was screened for viral respiratory pathogens by real time reverse transcription PCR by using published methods (7).

Seroconverted, naturally infected, captive-bred chimpanzees represented 61% of the laboratory population, which demonstrated that captive animals are readily infected with HMPV (9). Worldwide, nearly 100% of the human population has seroconverted to HMPV by 10 years of age, and most illness and death occurs in young, elderly, and immunocompromised persons, although persons in any age group can become infected (10, 11) . Immunity is transient, and reinfections with the same or different strains are common, but illness is reduced (10, 11) . Recent evidence suggests these findings are also found in captive and wild chimpanzees (9, 12) and other primates (13). In this instance, the congenital thoracic defect may have affected the ability of the chimpanzee to survive. In contrast to other cases in which apes were infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae (3) (4) (5) , only rare lung bacteria were observed histologically and lung bacterial cultures were negative. These findings, in combination with the absence of major suppurative inflammation, suggest that HMPV was the primary pathogen.",

            "text": "Given the ubiquitous nature of this human virus in North America and the frequency with which it infects humans, it is notable that all members of the affected chimpanzee troop were born in captivity and had contact with humans throughout their lives, yet still remained negative for this virus until March 2009. Because HMPV is a recently discovered virus that closely resembles other respiratory viruses in its clinical course and few animal facilities specifically test for it, the degree of illness associated with this disease in the captive great ape population is unknown. Therefore, enhanced biosecurity and disease surveillance measures for HMPV should be considered for great apes. In addition to the commonly tested viral respiratory pathogens of great apes, surveillance for HMPV by serologic analysis at quarantine or preventative medical examinations would provide additional benefits. These procedures would enable management to tailor biosecurity protocols and procedures to limit the risk for exposure of HMPV-negative animals or troops, particularly during the height of the HMPV season.
