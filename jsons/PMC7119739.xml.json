In Spain, a serological survey carried out in 1993\u20131994 detected antibodies against the virus in 54% of the breeding herds (Carvajal et al., 1995b). Moreover, over the last 4 years the virus has been found in a high percentage of the clinical cases of diarrhoea analysed at our laboratory. These data indicate that PEDV is currently one of the most important causes of gastroenterical disorders in pigs in Spain, which seems to be the same case in other countries (Van Reeth and Pensaert, 1994).",

However, due to the special features of the mucosal immune system of the pigs, the presence of serum antibodies against gastroenteric pathogens is not always correlated with protection (Saif and Wesley, 1999, Saif, 1996, Saif et al., 1994, To et al., 1998, Ward et al., 1996) and only proves the contact with the microorganism.",

Considering the fact that in the enteric infections in porcine is the local immunity which plays the main role in protection instead of the systemic immunity, as previously mentioned, the first step was to develop techniques to investigate the immune response to PEDV in different tissues. Finally, we tried to emulate a natural infection by inoculating conventional pigs with a virulent strain of PEDV and monitorised the humoral response in different locations of the lymphoid system, involving gut associated lymphoid tissues as well as systemic tissues.",

In spite of the fact that no statistical studies were carried out, ELISPOT performed with infected cell culture plates gave better results in terms of sensitivity and specificity. In the immunocaptured plates we used a Mab directed against S-protein of PEDV and, therefore, most of the viral antigen captured in the plate could be fragments of the spike more than the complete viral particle. On the other hand, viral inoculum for peritoneal immunisation of the animals was concentrated using ultracentrifugation and may then induce a high immune response against N and M protein which could be better detected with the infected and fixed cell plates.",

The earlier presence of specific ASC in these tissues could be related to its anatomic proximity to the virus replication site in the enterocytes of the small intestine. The antigen could be delivered immediately to the lamina propria where it would stimulate the local immune response whereas its diffusion to the mesenteric lymph nodes would be more delayed (Corthesy and Kraehenbuhl, 1999, Kagnoff, 1996, Kraehenbuhl and Neutra, 1992, Neutra et al., 1996, Neutra et al., 1996).",

This difference could be due to a lower sensitivity of the ELISPOT performed for PEDV which would not detect low numbers of specific-IgA and IgG ASC present in the first weeks after the infection. We also have to consider that experiences with rotavirus were carried out with gnotobiotic pigs in which the antigen-specific ASC/total ASC ratio is higher than in conventional animals.

As mentioned previously, we explain this finding as a consequence of the lymphocyte homing, a process in which the lymphocytes migrate through the blood to the efector sites, such as the intestinal lamina propria, after completing its maturating in distal sites of the mucosal immune system (Corthesy and Kraehenbuhl, 1999, Kagnoff, 1996, Kantele et al., 1997, Salmi and Jalkanen, 1997). Thus, at least shortly after the infection, the PEDV specific ASC present in the blood could be considered more related to the response in mucosal associated lymph tissues than to the systemic response.",

No specific-ASC was evidenced after the secondary in vitro stimulation of MNC obtained from control animals with no previous contact with PEDV. This result confirms, as it has been described for other virus (Berthon et al., 1990, Van Cott et al., 1993, Yuan et al., 1996), that only previously in vivo stimulated cells are capable of developing a specific response when stimulated in vitro with PEDV antigen. Moreover, a limited number of IgM ASC were detected at PID 4, memory B cells appeared consistently at PID 21 in mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen and blood from PEDV infected pigs. Similar results have been found after oral inoculation of pigs with porcine rotavirus (Yuan et al., 1996) while in TGEV infected animals specific B memory cells were detected from PID 12 (Van Cott et al., 1993). Again, the number of PEDV\u2013ASC per 5\u00d7105 MNC after secondary in vitro stimulation were lower than reported by Van Cott et al. (1993) in similar studies for TGEV. As we have suggested for the in vivo response, this difference could be attributed either to a lower sensitivity of the ELISPOT performed with PEDV or to differences in the immune response against each virus. In agreement with other authors (Berthon et al., 1990, Van Cott et al., 1993, Van Cott et al., 1994) and as described for the in vivo stimulated ASC, clear predominance of PEDV-specific IgG ASC was observed in systemic lymphoid tissues, blood and spleen, but not in the mesenteric lymph nodes where, at PID 21, IgA ASC outnumbered IgG ASC although reverse circumstances occurred at PID 25.",
