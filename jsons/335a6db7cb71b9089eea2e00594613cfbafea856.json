According to our previous studies in 2003 on patients hospitalized for severe SARS-CoV, the viral load peaked between day 7 from symptoms onset and coincided with clinical deterioration of pneumonia and respiratory failure, with majority of the patients required intensive care support.

The wells were washed for 4 timeswith wash buffer and added with 100 \u03bcl of stabilized chromogen, and incubated for 30minutes at room temperature in the dark. One hundred \u03bcl of stop solution was added to eachwell. The absorbance was read at 450 nm. The concentration of each serum sample wasdetermined from the standard curve.",

The ELISA protocol was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, 100 \u00b5l of diluted serum or standard and 100 \u00b5l of Human IL-6 Biotin conjugate simultaneously were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. For Human IL-10 and Human TNF-\u03b1, 100 \u00b5l of corresponding Biotin conjugate was added to wells after washing 4 times with wash buffer and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The wells were then washed again for 4 times with wash buffer and followed by addition of 100 \u00b5l of streptavidin-HPR, and further incubated for 30 minutes. The wells were washed for 4 times with wash buffer and added with 100 \u00b5l of stabilized chromogen, and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark. One hundred \u00b5l of stop solution was added to each well. The absorbance was read at 450 nm. The concentration of each serum sample was determined from the standard curve.[2][3][4] Nanopore sequencing of nsp5 gene (encoding the protease 3CLpro)Nsp5 gene was amplified from TNA by SuperScript\u2122 III one-step RT-PCR system withPlatinum\u2122 Taq High Fidelity DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, underlined bases represent 5' universal tails that are complementary to the barcode primers of PCR Barcoding kit [EXP-PBC096] manufactured by Oxford Nanopore Technologies. RT-PCR conditions were 50\u00b0C for 30 min, 94\u00b0C for 2 min, then 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0Cfor 30 s and 68\u00b0C for 1 min 10 s. Subsequent library preparation was performed according to manufacturer's instructions as we described previously.5  Briefly, amplified PCR products were purified by 0.8x AMPure XP bead (Beckman Coulter, California, CA, USA) and were then subjected to PCR barcoding (EXP-PBC096). Barcoded PCR products were purified by 0.8x AMPure XP bead before pooled together in equal molar for end repair and sequencing adaptor ligation (SQK-LSK109). Finally, sequencing was performed on Oxford Nanopore MinION platform using R9.4.1 flow cell for 12 hours.After sequencing, the raw signal data was basecalled and demultiplexed into FASTQ files using Guppy v3.4.1 with the accurate basecalling mode and an extra of 60 bp was trimmed at both ends to remove low quality bases. The QC passing score was set to 10 to ensure high quality reads were obtained. Next, the DNA sequences were mapped on the reference genome Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (NCBI accession number MN908947.3) to generate an alignment file using Minimap2 with the default settings.6  BCFtools mpileup was used in creating a variant file.7  While BCFtools call, vcfutils.pl8 and Seqtk seq were used in generating the FASTA consensus sequences. A mutation is considered to be true if it exists in >20% of the reads at a particular nucleotide position. The consensus sequences and raw reads have been deposited into GenBank (Accession number: pending) and Bioproject (Accession number: PRJNA615965).Table 1-Univariable analysis for baseline factors associated with negative day 7 nasopharyngeal swab viral load RT-PCR; Median (IQR) *P<0.05; **P<0.01; ***P<0.001; ****P<0.0001 (treatment vs. control <7 days from symptoms-onset) #P<0.05 (treatment vs. control \u22657 days from symptoms-onset) Baseline 100% positive NPS: nasopharyngeal swab; VL: viral load IFN beta-1b: Interferon beta-1b",
