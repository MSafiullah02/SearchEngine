A Danish study including more than 18,000 Danish twins reached a different conclusion: severe RSV-induced illnesses were associated with recurrent wheezing during early childhood,58, 59 but this was attributable to genetic predisposition for both more severe RSV-induced illness and asthma.59 Two studies of RSV immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab in preterm or high-risk infants demonstrated that prevention of more severe RSV-induced illness decreased recurrent wheezing but not atopic asthma.60, 61\n",

Transcriptional profiling of PBMCs during RSV infections demonstrates stimulation of innate immune and cell-cycle pathways and downregulation of B and T cell\u2013related genes. The latter finding was more pronounced in infants infected with RSV compared with RV, which is consistent with other studies that have demonstrated virus-specific patterns of gene expression.77, 78 Interestingly, RSV can infect B cells,79 whereas some RVs can bind to B cells and induce proliferation.80 The combined effects of the virus and the inflammatory response lead to epithelial damage and sloughing, mucus production, and ultimately airway obstruction leading to wheezing.36, 51, 81, 82\n",

            "text": "Interactions between allergic sensitization and RV-induced wheezing have been described. For example, both RV infections and allergens can enhance the airway epithelial cell production of IL-25 and IL-33, which promotes type 2 airway inflammation and remodeling.102, 103 The IL-33 polymorphism is linked to intermediate and late-onset wheezing and allergic sensitization.104 The first line of defense against RV infection is the airway epithelium, which is relatively resistant to infection when undamaged. Disrupted airway epithelium can favor RV replication by opening the way to deeper cell layers in which RV replicates most actively and by increasing the number of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 receptors as shown in recent in vitro studies.105 Damaged barrier function of the airway epithelium can also lead to enhanced absorption of aeroallergens or invasion of bacterial pathogens through the airway wall.106 Finally, RVs can contribute to airway remodeling by inducing vascular endothelial growth factor, TGF-\u03b2, and chemoattractants for airway smooth muscle cells.107, 108 These effects might be more pronounced for RV infections in early life.109 Thus repeated RV infections that extend to the lower airways could damage the airways and lead to remodeling of airway structures.",

For example, urban children with moderate-to-severe asthma were randomized to treatment with either standard asthma controller therapy or standard therapy plus omalizumab. In 2 separate studies both year-round and preseasonal treatment with omalizumab eliminated the seasonal peaks in exacerbations, most of which are associated with viral infection.138, 139 Analysis of weekly samples of nasal secretions confirmed that omalizumab reduced virus-induced exacerbations, and this effect was most pronounced in children with more severe asthma.138 Furthermore, omalizumab increased IFN-\u03b1 responses of blood cells stimulated with RV ex vivo. This finding suggested that omalizumab, by neutralizing IgE, indirectly improved antiviral responses. This theory is further supported by the findings that omalizumab reduced the frequency, quantity, and duration of RV detection in nasal secretions sampled weekly and also reduced the frequency of RV-induced colds by about one third.127 In a study of children with acute asthma exacerbations, RV-induced exacerbations were less severe in those children who had been treated with omalizumab compared with other controllers.140\n",

These findings suggest that there are a number of therapeutic opportunities to reduce the frequency and severity of viral respiratory illnesses and hopefully secondary effects on the incidence and exacerbation of asthma (Fig 3\n). The search goes on for effective antivirals and vaccines for RV and RSV, and several candidates are currently in clinical trials (reviewed by Edwards et al152). Antiviral approaches also include strategies to enhance resistance to multiple respiratory viruses through administration of interferons or other immunostimulatory molecules. Furthermore, the search is on to identify biologic exposures (eg, microbes and proteins) that might help to promote the development of healthy mucosal immune responses that resist viral infection. Research into the airway microbiome has identified a number of intriguing associations with bacteria that might either protect against viral illnesses or add to the problem. These findings suggest possibilities for 2 new therapeutic approaches: (1) identify a new class of probiotics selected to promote resistance to viral illnesses and (2) develop strategies to inhibit pathogenic bacteria that synergize with viruses and add to illness severity. The latter approach could involve antibacterial vaccines or probiotics. Targeted antimicrobial therapy could also be considered, although potential benefits must be weighed against further selection of antimicrobial-resistant organisms and possible short- and long-term detrimental effects on commensal or beneficial airway or gut bacteria. Finally, treatments that can either prevent allergy or moderate its severity could secondarily boost antiviral responses and also reduce inflammatory responses that lead to airway obstruction and remodeling.",
