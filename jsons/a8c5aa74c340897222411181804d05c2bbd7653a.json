Transcriptome and proteome analyses were performed from endomyocardial restoring samples which were no longer needed for routine diagnostics.

For representative reflection of ongoing molecular processes in the heart 3-4 biopsy specimens -which were no longer needed for routine clinical diagnostics -were used for transcriptome and proteome analyses. To estimate the fibrosis grade or the number of inflammatory cells other biopsy specimens (1mm 3 ) were used. The grade of fibrosis did not differ so much that a significant alteration upon therapy could be detected. However, the number of inflammation positive responders decreased significantly after therapy (see manuscript Table 2 ). In line with these results and already published data [12] we assumed fibrosis grade and inflammation to be parameters affected by IA/IgG. Adjustment for these parameters would thus mask the molecular alterations associated with IA/IgG and was therefore not performed.",

            "text": "Quantitative proteomics and mass spectrometry according to Hammer et al. (2011)[6] Sample preparation Sample aliquots of 4 \u03bcg were diluted with 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) until a final concentration of less than 1 M urea was reached. Following reduction by 2.5 mM DTT (1 h at 60\u00b0C) and alkylation by 10 mM iodoacetamide (30 min at 37\u00b0C) endoproteinase Lys-C (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany) in a ratio of 1:100 to substrate proteins was added and digestion proceeded for 3 h at 37\u00b0C. Subsequently, the samples were digested with trypsin (1:10) over night at 37\u00b0C for 18 h. The reaction was stopped with a final concentration of 1% acetic acid and the peptide mixtures were desalted on C-18 reverse phase material (ZipTip \u03bc-C18 Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA). Peptides were eluted in 50% and 80% acetonitrile (ACN) each in 1% acetic acid. Pooled eluates were concentrated to 2 \u03bcl in a vacuum concentrator (5303, Eppendorf, Wesseling, Germany) and resuspended in 2% ACN in 0.1% acetic acid. Peptide separation was optimized using a non-linear 86 min gradient of 5-60% ACN in 0.1% acetic acid at a constant flow rate of 400 nl/min on a nanoAcquity UPLC reverse phase column (BEH130, C18, 100 \u03bcm x 100 mm, Waters Corporation, Milford, USA) operated on a nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters). The eluate was directed into a LTQ-Orbitrab Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a nano electrospray ion source. After a survey scan in the Orbitrab analyzer (scan m/z 300-2000 Da), 10 MS/MS spectra were recorded in the LTQ in a data dependent mode with exclusion times of 90 sec. In total 46 samples were run. Database search Proteins were identified via a Elucidator web interface by an automated database search in a forward-reverse Swiss-Prot database rel.08/2012 (limited to human entries) using the Sequest algorithm (Sorcerer built 4.04, Sage-N Research Inc., Milpitas, CA, U.S.A.). Parent mass tolerance (MS) was set to 10 ppm and fragment mass tolerance 1 Da. Carbamido methylation of cystein was a fixed modification and methionine oxidation was considered as optional modification. Peptides were annotated at a false positive rate of 1% calculated in Elucidator based on PeptideTeller (Peptide Prophet). Protein identification was based on at least two significant peptides.",
