These small, isometric, positive stranded RNA viruses have approximately 6.3\u20136.8 kb genomes that are similar in organization to those of the tymoviruses and encode large polyproteins with methyltransferase, helicase, and polymerase motifs (reviewed in Dreher et al., 2011). While the tymovirus coat protein (CP) is encoded in a separate open reading frame (ORF) just downstream of the polyprotein ORF, marafivirus CP-encoding sequences are nested within, and are 3' co-terminal with, the ORF encoding the polyprotein. The tymovirus genome expression strategy has been shown to employ a papain-like protease to process the large precursor polyprotein, while the CP is translated directly from a subgenomic RNA (Dreher et al., 2011). A highly conserved core sequence known as the tymobox serves as a promoter for transcription of this sgRNA (Ding et al., 1990).",

(1997) proposed a model for expression of the oat blue dwarf virus (OBDV) genome based in part on its genomic similarities with tymoviruses. Marafiviruses possess a sequence analogous to the highly conserved tymobox subgenomic promoter sequence, known as the marafibox (Izadpanah et al., 2002), which is presumed to have a similar function. Virions of marafiviruses, however, contain a major CP of 21 kDa and a minor CP of 24 kDa that differ only by an amino terminal extension present in the minor CP, whereas tymoviral particles contain a single CP. Because these CPs likely have a role in transmissibility of leafhopper-borne marafiviruses and the fact that there are structural differences between marafivirus and tymovirus genomes, the CP expression strategy of marafiviruses is an important feature to characterize. We now report the use of mutation analysis with an infectious OBDV clone to dissect and analyze CP expression of OBDV as a first step toward a better understanding of marafivirus gene expression. We also map the initial nucleotide at the 5'-terminus of the sgRNA encoding the CPs and show that it is consistent in position relative to the tymobox/marafibox with that of sgRNA termini of the tymoviruses.",

This is the known 5'-end nucleotide for the sgRNAs of turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV), ononis yellow mosaic virus (OYMV), and kennedya yellow mosaic virus (KYMV) (Ding et al., 1990, Guilley and Briand, 1978). To determine whether the conserved A in that position in OBDV (A5573) is the 5'-terminal nucleotide of the OBDV sgRNA, 5'-RACE was performed on size-fractionated RNA extracted from infected protoplasts and the resulting amplicons were sequenced (not shown). Sequence data showed that A5573 represents the 5'-end of the OBDV sgRNA encoding the viral CPs and is the likely start site of transcription for this 939 nt sgRNA (excluding the poly A tail). OBDV is the first marafivirus for which this has been determined, thus providing the first experimental evidence that this highly conserved adenine nucleotide likely represents the 5'-terminus of other marafivirus sgRNAs as well. These results are consistent with the evolutionary homology of the tymobox/marafibox sequence and its putative role as promoter of sgRNA synthesis.",

Mutation of two key nucleotides (mutant AB15-25) reduced transcription of the sgRNA to an undetectable level even after 40 h of incubation, with a concomitant large reduction in accumulation of both forms of CP (Fig. 2). Production of neither CP was completely eliminated, suggesting that either sgRNA production was not completely shut down or that a low level of translation from gRNA occurred. An extraneous band migrating slightly faster than the minor CP appeared in some instances on western blots, perhaps representing a conformational variant (Edwards et al., 1997). Interestingly, gRNA accumulation was also significantly reduced relative to that of wild type. This reduction appeared to be due to the loss of the major CP and not to the marafibox mutations, a view supported by similar reductions in gRNA accumulation for two other mutants whose ability to produce major CP was severely compromised (GH1-7 premature termination mutant and KL1-3 initiation codon mutant; Fig. 2).",

            "text": "Results with point mutants generating premature stop codons (CD3-1, EF2-2, and GH1-7) confirmed and expanded our previous model for the origins of the major and minor CPs of OBDV. When a stop codon (UAA5731) was placed downstream of the major CP initiation codon (mutant GH1-7), neither CP was detectable after 24 h (\nFig. 3) and gRNA accumulation was greatly reduced (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). However, a trace amount of major CP was detectable after 40 h (Fig. 2), possibly due to UAA suppression from this highly translated ORF (Lao et al., 2009). With the stop codon (UAG5599) placed upstream of the major CP initiation codon (mutant EF2-2), abundant major CP was produced without detectable minor CP (Fig. 3). That the accumulation of gRNA and major CP was restored to near wild type levels in mutant EF2-2 suggests that the reduction of gRNA accumulation in mutant GH1-7 was linked to the absence of major CP expression. Mutant CD3-1 (UAA5578) positions the stop codon upstream of both the candidate start codon for the minor CP as well as the start codon for the major CP and thus precludes translation of either CP as a part of the polyprotein; both a minor and major CP are produced by this mutant (not shown). Thus, complete translation of the entire polyprotein ORF is not an absolute requirement for the production of either CP species, and AUG5581 is the probable initiation codon for the production of at least some fraction of the minor CP pool despite its close proximity to the 5' terminus of the sgRNA. Although such a short leader (8 nt for OBDV, as close as 1 nt for other marafiviruses) is unusual, initiation of translation at AUG codons positioned very close to the 5' end has been observed in other biological systems (Li and Wang, 2004, Elfakess and Dikstein, 2008).",

To further investigate this possibility, the candidate cleavage site was changed from Gly\u2013Gly1834 to Val\u2013Val1834 (mutant MN6-1;\nFig. 4). Typical accumulation of major CP was observed for this mutant, but the apparent size of the minor CP increased slightly, suggesting production exclusively from translation initiating at AUG5581 (Fig. 4). A similar result was obtained when Gly\u2013Gly1834 was changed to Gly\u2013Val1834 in mutant MN2-1 (not shown). When both the putative cleavage and initiation sites were knocked out by changing AUG5581 to GUA in the MN6-1 background (double mutants IJMN9A and B), only major CP was detected in infected protoplasts. When combined with the results from premature stop codon mutant CD3-1 and initiation codon mutant IJ4-7, it is clear the minor CP can be produced by cleavage of either or both the polyprotein and the minor CP originating from sgRNA translation.",

            "text": "The empirical evidence offered here, taken together with previous sequence analysis by Edwards et al. (1997), supports a model for OBDV CP expression in which the major CP is translated directly from the 939 nt sgRNA (excluding the polyA tail), while the minor CP is cleaved from both the polyprotein and a minor CP precursor translated from the sgRNA. The underlying reason for the existence of multiple means of expression of the minor CP is not evident. While cleavage from the replicase polyprotein provides a source of minor CP, it may be that production of minor CP exclusively through this mechanism doesn't provide stoichiometric amounts necessary for virion assembly. It is also possible that viruses such as OBDV are in an evolutionary transition toward CP production solely via sgRNAs and that readthrough of the larger replicase polyprotein is vestigial. In any case, production of the minor CP through a cleavage mechanism provides a regulatory feature with probable functional significance for both replication and encapsidation. Ultimately, the complexity of CP expression relative to that of tymoviruses may relate in some way to the infection by OBDV of both plant and insect hosts.",

            "text": "To consider this model in the larger context of CP expression in the marafiviruses as a group, amino acid sequences of known and proposed marafiviruses were aligned and compared (\nFig. 5). In all cases, putative initiator methionine residues for both minor and major CPs are evident. The putative initiator Met for the minor CP is 5\u201315 amino acids downstream of the highly conserved GELL motif that is encoded by the core sequence of the marafibox. With the exception of maize rayado fino virus (MRFV), switchgrass mosaic virus (SwMV), and Bermudagrass etched-line virus (BELV), a conserved motif comprised of LXGG is present 7\u20138 amino acids downstream of the initiator Met. Since this incorporates the demonstrated cleavage site that creates the amino terminus of the OBDV minor CP, it is reasonable to speculate that production of these other marafivirus minor CPs also involves cleavage at this site. A similar motif is present immediately upstream of the putative initiator Met in the polyproteins of MRFV, SwMV, and BELV. The SwMV sequence encodes an alanine at the putative cleavage site, but that is consistent with the previous observations of Kadar\u00e9 et al. (1995) and Sulea et al. (2006), who noted the presence of G or A residues in the P1 and P2 positions of confirmed and predicted cleavage site sequences of tymo- and coronaviruses, respectively. Thus, we propose the consensus sequence at the predicted cleavage site associated with minor CP expression in marafiviruses is LXG[G/A]. Intriguingly, to counter cellular antiviral strategies that utilize the ubiquitin-proteasome system, the protease of the closely-related TYMV cleaves ubiquitin conjugates from its RdRp at the same consensus sequence in addition to its role in polyprotein processing (Chenon et al., 2012). Moreover, this consensus sequence is targeted by other viral cysteine proteases with both deubiquitinating and polyprotein processing activities (Barretto et al., 2005, Clementz et al., 2010, Karpe and Lole, 2011, Wang et al., 2011).",

For the latter, the predicted cleavage sites lie upstream of the predicted minor CP initiation codons, necessitating further studies to determine the precise CP expression strategies of these viruses. The location of the predicted cleavage site downstream from the initiator methionine of the minor CP would provide a consistent amino terminus for minor CP produced by cleavage of both the replicase polyprotein and a minor CP precursor translated directly from sgRNA. Irrespective of the role of protein cleavage in the formation of the minor CP N-terminus, an important function of the cleavage site may be to liberate the polymerase from the CP. The location of a putative protease cleavage site upstream of the initiator methionine for the minor CPs of SwMV, MRFV, and BELV is consistent with this view. Furthermore, the single CP of the closely-related but unclassified Poinsettia mosaic virus (PnMV) is fused to the PnMV replicase polyprotein, and the amino acid sequence between the marafibox and the CP also harbors a predicted LXGA cleavage site sequence (Fig. 5). Thus, the LXG[G/A] motif is well conserved among viruses of the Tymoviridae that possess a replicase-CP fusion, regardless of the precise location of the motif relative to the CP translation initiation codon.",

General amplification primers OBD5140fwd and OBD5901rev were used in conjunction with mutagenic primers (Fig. 1,\nTable 1) to produce overlapping amplicons. PCR reactions included 1 ng of linearized plasmid as template and conditions were as described in Higuchi (1990). Typical reactions contained 1X Platinum Taq buffer, 0.1 mM each d(GATC)TP, 30 ng of each oligonucleotide primer, and 0.5 units of Platinum Taq High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY USA) in a volume of 30 \u00b5l. Thermocycling parameters were 95 \u00b0C, 30 s; 55 \u00b0C, 30 s; and 72 \u00b0C, 2 min per cycle over 30 cycles total.

CLUSTAL-W (Larkin et al., 2007) was used to align the resulting nucleotide sequences and the sgRNA 5'-end determined; initial protein sequence alignments used to illustrate conservation of amino acid residues around the CP amino termini employed the same software.",

(A) Diagram of the OBDV genome and the nucleotide sequence in the region encoding the CPs. The genomic RNA possesses a 5' cap structure (star) and a 3'-poly A tail (An). The single, large ORF encodes a polyprotein with domains specifying methyltransferase (mtr), protease (pro), helicase/NTpase (hel), and polymerase (pol) activities fused to the sequence encoding the CPs. The major and minor coat proteins map to the same CP sequence and size differences between them are potentially determined by translation initiation at two different start codons (minor, AUG5581 and major, AUG5710). Whereas the major CP is postulated to be translated primarily from sgRNA, the minor CP could be produced by translation directly from the sgRNA, by cleavage after Gly\u2013Gly(\u25bc) of either or both the large polyprotein or a protein initiated at AUG5581, or by both direct translation and cleavage. The putative promoter for sgRNA synthesis, the marafibox, is underlined and the start site for sgRNA synthesis (this work) is indicated by the bent arrow. Sites where premature termination codons were introduced are indicated by asterisks. Mutant names are shown above the corresponding sequence locations, and amino acid changes in potential initiation and protease cleavage site codons are shown under the sequence. (B) Mutant description and nomenclature. The mutant name is followed by indication of nucleotide/codon substitutions and the cognate amino acid change. Mutant IJMN-9 represents a double mutant altering both the putative minor CP initiation codon and the potential cleavage site.",
