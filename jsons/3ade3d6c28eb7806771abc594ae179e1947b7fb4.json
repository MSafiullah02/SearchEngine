It is characterized by \"excessive plant and algal growth due to the increased availability of one or more limiting growth factors needed for photosynthesis\" (Schindler 2006) , such as sunlight, carbon dioxide, and nutrients. \"Eutrophication occurs naturally over centuries as lakes age and are filled in with sediments\" (Carpenter 1981) .

However, \"during 1960s and 1970s, scientists linked algal blooms to nutrient enrichment resulting from anthropogenic activities such as agriculture, industry and sewage disposal\" (Schindler 1974) . The known \"consequences of cultural eutrophication include blooms of blue-green algae (cyanobacteria), tainted drinking water supplies, degradation of recreational opportunities and hypoxia\" . The most obvious effect of cultural eutrophication is the creation of dense blooms of noxious, foul \"smelling phytoplankton\" that reduce water clarity and \"harm water quality.\" \"Algal blooms limit light penetration, reduce growth and cause death of plants in littoral zones and also lower the success of predators that need light to catch prey\" (Lehtiniemi et al. 2005) . Furthermore, high rates of photosynthesis associated with eutrophication can deplete dissolved inorganic carbon and raise pH to extreme levels during the day. \"Elevated pH can in turn 'blind' organisms that rely on perception of dissolved chemical cues for their survival by impairing their chemosensory abilities\" (Turner and Chislock 2010) . When these \"dense algal blooms eventually die, microbial decomposition severely depletes DO, creating a hypoxic dead zone, lacking sufficient oxygen to support most organisms.\" Dead zones are found in many \"freshwater lakes including the Laurentian Great Lakes\" (e.g., central basin of Lake Erie; Arend et al. 2011 ) during the summer. Furthermore, such \"hypoxic events are particularly common in marine coastal environments surrounding large, nutrient-rich rivers\" (e.g., Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico; Susquehanna River and the Chesapeake Bay) and have been shown to affect more than 245,000 square kilometers in over 400 near-shore systems (Diaz and Rosenberg 2008). \"Hypoxia and anoxia as a result of eutrophication continue to threaten profitable commercial and recreational fisheries worldwide. Some algal blooms pose an additional threat because they produce noxious toxins\" (e.g., microcystin and anatoxin-a) (Chorus and Bartram 1999) . Over the past century, \"harmful algal blooms (HABs) have been linked with (1) degradation of water quality\" (Francis 1878), (2) \"destruction of economically important fisheries\" (Burkholder et al. 1992) , and (3) \"public health risks\" (Morris 1999) . Within freshwater ecosystems, \"cyanobacteria are the most important phytoplankton associated with HABs\" (Paerl 1988) . \"Toxigenic cyanobacteria, including Anabaena, Cylindrospermopsis, Microcystis, and Oscillatoria (Planktothrix), tend to dominate nutrient-rich, freshwater systems due to their superior competitive abilities under high nutrient concentrations, low nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratios, low light levels, reduced mixing, and high temperatures\" (Downing et al. 2001; Paerl and Huisman 2009; Paerl and Paul 2012) . Poisonings of \"domestic animals, wildlife and even humans by blooms of toxic cyanobacteria\" have been recognized throughout the world. Francis (1878) has first observed dead livestock due to \"algal bloom of cyanobacteria\" . Also, cyanobacteria is responsible for several off-flavor compounds (e.g., methylisoborneal and geosmin) found in municipal drinking water systems as well as in aquaculture-raised fishes, resulting in large financial losses for state and regional economies (Crews and Chappell 2007). In addition to posing \"significant public health risks, cyanobacteria have been shown to be poor quality food for most zooplankton grazers in laboratory studies\" (Tillmanns et al. 2008; Wilson et al. 2006) , thus reducing the efficiency of energy transfer in aquatic food webs and potentially preventing zooplankton from controlling algal blooms. Eutrophication is also associated with major changes in aquatic community structure. During \"cyanobacterial blooms, small-bodied zooplankton tend to dominate plankton communities, and past observational studies have attributed this pattern to anti-herbivore traits of cyanobacteria\" (e.g., toxicity, morphology, and poor food quality) (Porter 1977) . However, the biomass of planktivorous fish is often positively related to nutrient levels and ecosystem productivity. Piscivorous fishes (e.g., bass, pike) tend to dominate the fish community of nutrient-poor, oligotrophic lakes, while planktivorous fishes (e.g., shad, bream) become increasingly \"dominant with nutrient enrichment\" (Jeppesen et al. 1997) . Thus, an alternative explanation for the lack of zooplankton control of cyanobacterial blooms could include consumption of zooplankton by planktivores.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 261, "end": 277, "text": "(Schindler 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 424, "end": 440, "text": "(Carpenter 1981)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 496, "end": 521, "text": "(Fifield and Haines 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1525, "end": 1548, "text": "(Carpenter et al. 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1549, "end": 1565, "text": "Bhat et al. 2017", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1748, "end": 1764, "text": "(Schindler 1974)", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 2305, "end": 2329, "text": "(Lehtiniemi et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 2647, "end": 2673, "text": "(Turner and Chislock 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF125"}, {"start": 2973, "end": 2990, "text": "Arend et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3604, "end": 3629, "text": "(Chorus and Bartram 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 3810, "end": 3834, "text": "(Burkholder et al. 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 3867, "end": 3880, "text": "(Morris 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 3987, "end": 3999, "text": "(Paerl 1988)", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}, {"start": 4337, "end": 4358, "text": "(Downing et al. 2001;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4359, "end": 4382, "text": "Paerl and Huisman 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 4383, "end": 4403, "text": "Paerl and Paul 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 5076, "end": 5099, "text": "(Tillmanns et al. 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 5100, "end": 5119, "text": "Wilson et al. 2006)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5596, "end": 5609, "text": "(Porter 1977)", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 5945, "end": 5967, "text": "(Jeppesen et al. 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Eutrophication"}, {"text": "Among the several human pressures on aquatic ecosystems, the accumulation of plastic debris is one of the most apparent but least studied. \"Plastics generate significant benefits to the human society\" (Andrady and Neal 2009), but due to its \"durability, unsustainable use and inappropriate waste management plastics accumulate extensively in the natural habitats\" (Barnes et al. 2009 ).
