TfR1 is an ubiquitously expressed, homodimeric, type II transmembrane glycoprotein that assists iron uptake into cells through endocytosis of iron-loaded transferrin20. The dimeric ectodomain of human TfR1 (residues 89\u2013760) is a butterfly-shaped molecule with three subdomains: a 'protease-like' domain related in structure to certain zinc metalloproteases, an 'apical domain' and a 'helical domain', which makes the principal dimer contacts21. Transferrin interacts with the protease-like and helical domains22 but does not interfere with the entry of MACV17. Mutational analysis implicates the TfR1 apical domain as the principal site of interaction with New World arenaviral GPs, and a short segment in the TfR1 apical domain (residues 208\u2013212) is a critical determinant of virus host specificity18,23.",

As anticipated, MACV GP1 binds TfR1 through an extensive network of contacts with the apical domain. The atomic details of the GP1-TfR1 interface clarify the importance of several receptor residues implicated in New World arenavirus host specificity. On the viral glycoprotein side of this interface, there is substantial residue-sequence variability among GP1 proteins that bind the human receptor. We correlate this variability with differences among the sequences of the host-species TfR1 orthologs, which can serve as efficient receptors for the corresponding virus18,23. The specificities of the viral glycoproteins reflect long-term adaptation of the viruses in their natural hosts24; our data suggest that the New World hemorrhagic fever arenaviruses independently and fortuitously acquired their ability to bind human TfR1 and hence to cause human disease.",

We used a stably expressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line to express a soluble form of the ectodomain of hTfR1 (residues 117\u2013760), which we purified as described previously21.

The proteins, mixed in equimolar ratio, crystallized in the space group C2221 (Table 2). We determined the structure of the GP1\u2013hTfR1 complex using molecular replacement, with the hTfR1 monomer21 (PDB 1CX8) serving as a search model, and refined it using data extending to 2.4 \u00c5 (but incomplete beyond 2.7 \u00c5: Table 2). The final model of the GP1\u2013hTfR1 complex contains residues 121\u2013756 of the receptor, except for residues 316\u2013319, which are disordered, and residues 86\u2013241 of MACV GP1, with N-linked glycans at TfR1 positions 251 and 727 and at GP1 positions 95, 137, 166 and 178.",

            "text": "MACV GP1 contacts the tip of the apical domain of TfR1, with 1,900 \u00c52 of total surface area buried at the interface (Fig. 1). The apical domain of TfR1 is an insertion between the first and second strands in the central \u03b2-sheet of the protease-like domain. It resembles a \u03b2-sandwich in which the two sheets are splayed apart, with a helix (\u03b1II-2) running along the open edge, a fold similar to domain 4 of aconitase21. Helix \u03b1II-2 and strand \u03b2II-2 in the apical domain form most of the contacts with MACV GP1 (Fig. 1b). Residues 208\u2013212, built as an extended loop in previous structures of hTfR1 (refs. 21,25), have a \u03b2-strand conformation in our structure of the complex and form an extension of strand \u03b2II-2. This segment was poorly defined in previous structures of hTfR1 (refs. 21,25), which were determined at lower resolution (3.1 \u00c5 and 2.9 \u00c5), and further analysis of the electron density in the unliganded hTfR1 structure21 (PDB 1CX8) in light of our higher-resolution model shows that residues 208\u2013212 in unliganded hTfR1 adopt a very similar \u03b2-strand conformation (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Thus, GP1 binding induces no major main chain distortions in the TfR1 apical domain. It does, however, increase order in the extended \u03b2II-2 strand, displace the backbone, and change the orientation of Leu209 and switch the rotameric state of Tyr211 (Supplementary Fig. 2b).",

The sequences of MACV, JUNV, GTOV and SABV GP1 diverge substantially\u2014based on the alignment shown in Figure 2b, the pairwise identities of MACV GP1 residues 87\u2013242 with the corresponding GP1 sequences of JUNV, GTOV and SABV are 46%, 27% and 25%, respectively\u2014but hTfR1 is a cell-entry receptor for all three viruses17,19. TCRV (41% identify with MACV GP1) can use hTfR1 when either Arg208 or Val210 in the hTfR1 \u03b2II-2 strand is mutated to glycine, suggesting that modest changes in its GP1 protein might also allow it to bind human TfR1 (ref. 23). Amapari virus (AMAV, 29% GP1 sequence identity with MACV) can use hTfR1 when four mutations are made to the \u03b2II-1\u2013\u03b2II-2 loop and \u03b2II-2 strand in the receptor23. Thus, all six GP1 receptor-binding domains appear to be complementary to the same surface. Location of conserved residues in GP1 justifies the further assumption that, despite considerable sequence divergence, all New World arenavirus GP1s have the same framework structure.",

In viral contributions to interaction motif 1, the hydrogen bond between MACV GP1 Ser113 and the phenolic hydroxyl group of TfR1 Tyr211 can also be made by the threonine at that position in SABV and by the aspartate in JUNV and TCRV GP1 (Fig. 4b). GTOV and AMAV, however, have a hydrophobic residue at the equivalent of position 113; a glutamate nearby (replacing MACV GP1 Arg111) might accept the hydrogen bond instead. The residue at GP1 position 115, which lines the pocket occupied by TfR1 Tyr211, is isoleucine in MACV and JUNV, leucine in AMAV and valine in TCRV, GTOV and SABV. Residue 117, which contributes the other hydrophobic side chain lining the GP1 pocket for TfR1 Tyr211, is valine in MACV, JUNV, TCRV and AMAV, leucine in SABV and proline in GTOV. MACV GP1 Arg111, which makes prominent contacts with the TfR1 \u03b2II-2 strand, is not conserved in any of the other viruses. In motif 2, TfR1 Asn348 has reciprocal hydrogen bond interactions with the main chain amide and carbonyl of MACV GP1 Ser116; the side chain of this residue does not participate, nor is it conserved in any of the GPs. Interaction motif 3 is unique to MACV, as it involves the insert in loop 10. In motif 4, three of five MACV GP1 residues that contact TfR1 are conserved in the other clade B1 viruses TCRV and JUNV, and four of five are conserved between MACV and JUNV. However, substantial variability is seen in this motif when GTOV, AMAV and SABV are compared with the clade B1 viruses. In motif 5, Phe98 is replaced by a more polar residue in the other viruses, as might be expected, as absence of loop 10 would leave this phenylalanine substantially more exposed.",

TfR1 Asn348, which anchors the second interaction motif (Fig. 3b), is likewise conserved, except in CmTfR1 (JUNV host), which has a lysine at position 348. MACV cannot use CmTfR1 as a receptor, and the N348K substitution in the context of hTfR1 consistently disrupts the entry of MACV and GTOV into cells expressing this altered receptor18. The lysine at 348 would disrupt the hydrogen bond network that includes the C cap on TfR1 \u03b1II-2 and the main chain hydrogen bonds with MACV GP1 Ser116 (Fig. 3b). Presumably, JUNV, in adapting to the receptor of its native host, has evolved to accommodate Lys348 in binding to CmTfR1. In motif 3, the interaction unique to MACV, most of the receptors present a hydrophobic surface (valine or leucine at position 210 and leucine at position 212: Fig. 3c). The exceptions are CmTfR1 and AjTfR1 (from Artibeus jamaicensis). The former has a serine at position 210 and a proline at position 212; the latter, a glycine at position 210. Loop 10 of MACV GP1 engages this hydrophobic surface, with MACV GP1 Phe226 inserted between the side chains of TfR1 residues 210 and 212. The details of the contact suggest that C\u03b3 of proline at position 212 would clash with the Phe226 side chain, consistent with the failure of MACV efficiently to infect cells expressing CmTfR1 (ref. 18).",

Another difference in motif 4 is TfR1 residue 294, which is aspartate in the host receptor for MACV (and also those for JUNV, GTOV and AMAV) but glutamate in hTfR1.

The corresponding position is occupied by glycine in all New World arenavirus host-species receptors examined here, with the exception of the MACV host (CcTfR1), in which the position is occupied by an asparagine (Fig. 4d). The R208G mutation converts hTfR1 into a receptor for TCRV23. Because most of the viruses are probably best adapted to the absence of a large side chain at the 208 position in TfR1, we asked whether an R208G change in hTfR1 also affects the infectivity of MACV, JUNV and GTOV. We generated fusion proteins comprising the truncated GP1 subunits of MACV, JUNV or GTOV fused to the Fc portion of human IgG (GP1\u0394-Ig)17 and tested them for binding to CHO cells transfected with wild-type (WT) hTfR1 or hTfR1 R208G. MACV GP1\u0394-Ig bound CHO cells expressing either WT hTfR1 or hTfR1 R208G but bound the latter more strongly (Fig. 5a). JUNV and GTOV GP1\u0394-Ig bound only cells expressing hTfR1 R208G. Lack of detectable binding by JUNV and GTOV GP1\u0394-Ig to cells expressing WT hTfR1 probably resulted from the low affinity of these proteins for the wild-type receptor. Consistent with these data, the R208G mutation modestly enhanced infectious entry of MACV pseudovirus but led to substantial increases in infection by JUNV and GTOV pseudoviruses (Fig. 5b). The tip of the TfR1 apical domain (motif 5) is thus a determinant of entry by both pathogenic and nonpathogenic New World clade B arenaviruses. The rodent receptors all have a simple, four-residue \u03b2-turn in the \u03b2II-1\u2013\u03b2II-2 loop, whereas human TfR1 has a five-residue turn. The pathogenic viruses (MACV, JUNV and GTOV) have presumably adapted in their natural hosts to the shorter turn, which places a glycine at the 209 position instead of leucine. The substitution eliminates the hydrophobic contact we see between hTfR1 Leu209 and MACV GP1 Phe98 (Fig. 3e). The alternative interactions that we have suggested might be present in different virus-host pairs vary in character and position, and we therefore cannot readily predict from GP1 sequences alone how many residue changes might be needed to make any particular nonpathogenic New World clade B arenavirus infectious in humans without compromising ability to propagate in its natural host.",

This sequence variability, which presumably reflects the independent evolution of individual viruses in their various host species24, is best illustrated by the insert in MACV loop 10, which forms extensive receptor contacts yet is much shorter and lacks these contacts in the other viruses (Fig. 3b). Nonetheless, a number of similarities among the GP1 receptor-binding domains strongly support the assumption of a shared fold within members of the family. Conservation of key receptor residues in several of the interaction motifs indicates conservation of local features of the interface as well as of the overall docking of the two partners. The structure of the complex may therefore prove useful in predicting whether a novel New World arenavirus is likely to use TfR1. For example, extending the analysis shown in Figure 4 to the recently isolated New World hemorrhagic fever arenavirus Chapare suggests that this virus will indeed use TfR1 as its receptor8 (Supplementary Fig. 4).",

That loop is longer by one residue in human TfR1 than in its ortholog in any of the New World arenavirus native hosts, except for that of TCRV. Moreover, at the end of that loop, Arg208 in the human receptor becomes glycine in the host-species receptors (with the exception of the MACV host, where it is an asparagine), and the R208G mutation enhances infectivity of JUNV and GTOV and allows infection by TCRV. The large arginine residue thus presents a barrier to use of human TfR1 by both nonpathogenic23 and pathogenic New World clade B arenaviruses (Fig. 5). The New World clade B arenaviruses appear to be adapted best to their host-species receptors. We suggest that those infecting humans accidentally acquired the capacity to bind human TfR1 during coevolution with the receptor in their natural hosts. The structure of MACV GP1 bound to hTfR1 thus clarifies the complex structural basis for the zoonotic transmission of this important class of emerging human pathogens.",
