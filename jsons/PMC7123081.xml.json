            "text": "HLH/MAS is thought to be a multisystem inflammatory disorder resulting from a pro-inflammatory \u201ccytokine storm\u201d from excessively activated lymphocytes and macrophages [1]. Hemophagocytic syndromes are divided into primary and secondary forms. Primary cases are rare (1 in 50,000 live births), commonly present in the first year of life, and are often triggered by infection [2]. They include familial, or primary, forms of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (fHLH\n) that have specific genetic homozygous or compound heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in perforin-mediated cytolytic pathway proteins (e.g., PRF1, STX11, UNC13D, UNC18-2) employed by CD8 T cells and natural killer (NK) cells [3\u20136]. Children with certain immunodeficiency syndromes, such as Ch\u00e9diak-Higashi syndrome, type II Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, and type II Griscelli syndrome [7], have associated genetic defects in cytolysis and are also at risk for developing fHLH. Specific X-linked immunodeficiencies (signaling-lymphocytic-activation-molecule-associated protein (SAP) and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) deficiencies) are also associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) triggered HLH [8\u201310].",

Infectious agents, particularly EBV and other herpesvirus family members, may be the sHLH trigger, although identifiable infections are not always present [7]. In addition, up to 40% of sHLH and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) patients have been found to possess heterozygous (some dominant negative) mutations in known fHLH genes. Thus, some investigators consider MAS, sHLH, and fHLH to lie on a spectrum of disease [11].",

            "text": "In the clinical setting, the distinction between primary and secondary forms of HLH is less clear and even considered artificial by some. It was initially used to differentiate the primary, more fatal, infantile presentations from the secondary forms, which were considered to present later in life and to have better prognoses. However, it is now known that primary genetic forms can present later in life, even during adulthood [12, 13]. Furthermore, in some studies, only 40% of primary HLH cases are found to have recognized genetic mutations. Moreover, both primary and secondary HLH are known to be precipitated by infections [14, 15]. Finally, as mentioned previously, many patients with sHLH\nhave heterozygous mutations in known fHLH-associated genes, thus blurring the distinction between fHLH\nand sHLH. Regardless of terminology, the individual patient needs to be treated appropriately. At present, most clinicians would agree that clear-cut infantile cases of fHLH will need bone marrow transplantation, typically preceded by an aggressive chemotherapeutic regimen which includes etoposide and corticosteroids. In addition, identified infectious triggers should also be treated appropriately. For all other children and adults with HLH, the most appropriate treatment remains unclear. Etoposide is quite toxic, often leading to pancytopenia itself and increasing the risk of secondary sepsis as well as increased risk of secondary malignancies [14, 16]. Novel approaches have been anecdotally reported to dampen the overly exuberant immune response and control the cytokine storm and associated multiorgan dysfunction. Most notably, targeting of specific pro-inflammatory cytokines [e.g., interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3)] seems promising and lacks the toxicity associated with traditional chemotherapeutic approaches [17, 18].",

            "text": "MAS/HLH develops as a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d which is often triggered by infectious, rheumatologic, and oncologic diseases [24]. Although not well defined, the pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with MAS/HLH likely include IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, IFN-\u03b3, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) [25, 26] (Table 14.1). Also IL-27, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) may be increased [27\u201329]. Furthermore, chemokines, such as IL-8/CXCL8, MIG/CXCL9, IP10/CXCL10, I-TAC/CXCL11, MCP-1/CCL2, MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3, and MIP-1\u03b2/CCL4, have been reported to be increased [26, 30\u201332]. Both cytokines and chemokines activate the immune system, perpetuating the ongoing cytokine storm. On the other arm, levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10 and IL-18-binding protein (IL-18BP), are also increased but might not be sufficient to terminate the ongoing inflammation [33, 34]. Mazodier et al. described a discrepancy between the increase in IL-18 and its antagonist IL-18BP that lead to abnormally high levels of free IL-18 [33]. Similarly, the natural antagonist to IL-1, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), has been noted to be elevated during MAS/HLH, and a recombinant form of IL-1Ra has been reported by several groups to be an effective therapy for MAS/HLH/cytokine storm syndrome [35\u201337].\n",

Since fHLH\nis associated with biallelic defects in gene products involved in the perforin-mediated cytolytic pathway used by NK cells and CD8 T lymphocytes [48, 49], the inability to clear the antigenic stimulus and thus turn off the inflammatory response has been hypothesized to result in hypercytokinemia [50]. Recently, the inability of CD8 T cells and NK cells to lyse antigen-presenting cells (APCs) via the perforin-mediated cytolytic pathway was shown to prolong (by fivefold) the engagement time between the lytic lymphocyte and the APC. This prolonged interaction resulted in increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. For up to 40% of sHLH cases, single-copy mutations in these same perforin pathway genes have been reported. Some of the mutants have been demonstrated to act as complete or partial dominant-negative mutants [51\u201353], resulting in sHLH\nin older children and adults [53, 54], the oldest reported case being a 62-year-old patient [55]. One heterozygous mutation in RAB27A\nidentified in two unrelated sHLH patients was shown to act in a partial dominant-negative fashion and delayed cytolytic granule polarization to the immunologic synapse between NK cells and their target cells. This was also associated with an increase in IFN-\u03b3 production, mimicking the situation described for homozygous defects in perforin or granzyme B. Moreover, increased IL-6 production has been shown to decrease cytolytic activity of NK cells, further exacerbating the lytic defect and resultant production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

In a murine model of MAS, it was shown that repeated stimulation of toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) produced MAS on a normal genetic background, without exogenous antigen. Interestingly, the TLR9-induced MAS model\nwas IFN-\u03b3 dependent in some aspects of disease; however, lymphocytes were not required for the pathogenesis [57]. On the other hand, a state of inflammation may also reduce the lytic capacity of NK cells and CD8 T cells [58\u201360], resulting in cytokine storm due to frustrated phagocytosis. This was illustrated in a study where T-cell-directed immunotherapy\nfor refractory leukemia resulted in cytokine storm and an MAS-like presentation [61]. All the aforementioned pathways have led to the proposal that MAS is due to a combination of genetic predisposition and a hyperinflammatory state reducing cytolytic function, put into action by a trigger (e.g., infection, cancer, immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, and autoinflammation) [19, 53, 62\u201364]. At some point a threshold level of hypercytokinemia is reached at which the body is incapable of balancing the cytokine storm with anti-inflammatory products, such as IL-10, IL-1Ra, IL-18BP, and others. This is then believed to trigger the multiorgan dysfunction resulting in clinical HLH.",

However, therapeutic targeting of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6) to treat underlying rheumatic diseases that often result in MAS (e.g., sJIA) makes fever not an absolute finding in all cases. This is attributed to the powerful antipyretic effect of biologics such as inhibitors of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF. On examination , many patients have hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or both, and up to 50% of MAS/HLH patients have central nervous system involvement ranging from mild confusion to seizures or frank coma [65]. Different forms of rash can occur, often erythematous or purpuric. Patients can have progressive hepatic dysfunction and ultimately multiorgan failure . DIC-like features are often present and are partly explained by liver dysfunction, fibrinogen consumption, and thrombocytopenia [66]. This highlights the challenges in distinguishing microbial sepsis-induced DIC from HLH in the intensive care unit (ICU). Despite the similarities these two conditions share in clinical presentations, they are frequently treated differently: broad spectrum antibiotics (sepsis) versus immunosuppression (HLH), respectively [67]. As HLH is not a diagnosis of exclusion, and infections are common triggers of HLH, it is important to treat both infection and, if present, the associated cytokine storm of HLH.",

Those guidelines were developed to diagnose genetic homozygous/compound heterozygous cases of fHLH [11]. The main deficiencies regarding the HLH-2004 criteria for diagnosing MAS in patients with sJIA are due to the underlying inflammatory nature of sJIA versus fHLH. In active sJIA, one would expect elevated levels of white blood cell counts, platelets, and fibrinogen as part of the inflammatory process. Accordingly, a drop in their levels, which could still be in the normal limits as regards to the HLH-2004 criteria, should raise the suspicion of MAS. Also the underlying inflammatory process leads to elevated levels of ferritin [74]; therefore, the cutoff of ferritin >500 ng/ml in the HLH-2004 guidelines makes it difficult to distinguish MAS complicating sJIA from an sJIA flare. Adding to the shortcomings of HLH-2004 guidelines overall are the lack of availability and timely results of certain criteria, such as NK cell activity or sCD25 levels in many centers [25, 75, 76].",

The development of the 2016 criteria was conducted under the auspices of the European League Against Rheumatism, the American College of Rheumatology, and the Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organization [73]. Based on the common consensus that clinical criteria of MAS are often delayed and/or difficult to distinguish from an underlying disease flare, the 2016 sJIA-MAS criteria are based primarily on laboratory parameters with fever as the only clinical criterion [76]. These criteria are relatively simple yet proved to be both highly sensitive and specific.

Ultimately, simple criteria that are not necessarily disease specific but maintain high sensitivity and specificity for establishing an MAS/HLH diagnosis are needed.",

            "text": "Childhood SLE (cSLE) cases complicated by MAS have been reported with increasing frequency in the recent years. As an SLE disease flare itself often results in pancytopenia, diagnostic criteria for MAS in the setting of SLE are complicated. Accordingly, it has been suggested that cSLE-MAS may be under-recognized [78]. Preliminary guidelines for SLE-MAS were proposed in 2009. A study was conducted based on a multinational survey and data analyzing 38 patients with cSLE-MAS [72]. Patients who had evidence of macrophage hemophagocytosis on bone marrow aspiration were considered to have definite MAS, and those who did not were considered to have probable MAS. The sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of various clinical and laboratory parameters were compared in SLE patients with MAS versus patients with active juvenile SLE without MAS. The best diagnostic performance was obtained using the simultaneous presence of any one or more clinical criteria and any two or more laboratory criteria, which had a sensitivity of 92.1% and a specificity of 90.9% (Table 14.2). The demonstration of macrophage hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow aspirate was considered necessary for confirmation of doubtful cases only. Those results have led to the practical recommendation that in the clinical setting, MAS should be suspected in a patient with cSLE presenting with unexplained fever and cytopenia associated with hyperferritinemia. Both HLH-2004 criteria and preliminary diagnostic guidelines for sJIA-MAS were tested in the study but were found to be inaccurate for detecting cSLE-MAS. Interestingly, about two-thirds of the patients with cSLE-MAS developed it within 1 month of SLE diagnosis. The frequency of ICU admission was 43.7%, and the mortality rate was 11.4%.",

Perhaps more importantly, Gorelik et al. also reported that in their small cohort (28 sJIA patients) a ferritin to ESR ratio > 80 had the highest sensitivity and specificity (100% and 100%, respectively) in distinguishing between MAS and new-onset sJIA disease flare [84]. As ferritin rises due to inflammation in MAS/HLH, and the ESR tends to drop as fibrinogen (an important driver of high ESRs) is consumed during coagulopathy, a simple ratio of ferritin to ESR may prove to be a simple and valuable tool in getting clinicians to consider a diagnosis of MAS/HLH in their febrile hospitalized patients.",

In addition, serum neopterin and sTNF-RII levels were significantly higher during MAS compared to sJIA flares [85]. Other reports also showed that IL-18 levels were significantly elevated in sJIA [86, 87] and the patients with high levels were more likely to develop MAS [88].

During primary infection, EBV typically infects and replicates in B cells, whereas a function of EBV-specific cytotoxic T cells is the regulation of the infected B cells and the production of memory cells. On rare occasions, EBV may infect T cells and NK cells via CD21. CD21 is expressed on the surface of these cells and induces persistent EBV infection, with monoclonal or oligoclonal proliferation resulting in chronic active EBV infection, lymphoproliferative disorders, and fulminant EBV-HLH [211\u2013213]. Infection of CD8 T cells with EBV results in a cytokine storm with the release of pro-inflammatory and Th1-type cytokines [214], including TNF and IFN-\u03b3, leading to widespread lymphohistiocytic activation [215]. The resultant cytokine storm tends to be more prominent than those observed in non-EBV-HLH [216]. In addition, impaired function of T cells or NK cells is thought to provide a phenotypic presentation of HLH resulting from EBV via any genetic mutation\ninvolved in the T-cell and/or NK cell activation pathways [217, 218].",

            "text": "Serologic testing can help differentiate primary EBV infection\nfrom a reactivation process, although they have limitations such as delay in positivity and difficulty in result interpretation. Real-time PCR is used to measure the EBV viral load which can help predict prognosis and response to treatment [219]. EBV PCR levels are usually higher than those seen in uncomplicated cases of EBV infectious mononucleosis [220]. Other techniques are available to determine the involvement of T cells or NK cells in helping to confirm the diagnosis. T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement is detectable in half of the patients with EBV-HLH using Southern blotting and/or PCR analyses. It is hypothesized that the presence and change of TCR gene clonality probably plays a prognostic role for EBV-HLH [90]. Sandberg et al. [221] recently reported that Southern blot analysis could be replaced by BIOMED-2 multiplex PCR in routine testing of T-cell clonality. The EuroClonality (BIOMED-2) consortium developed a uniform reporting system for the description of the results and conclusions of Ig/TCR clonality assays to help improve the general performance level of clonality assessment and interpretation in cases with suspected lymphoproliferations [222]. It was reported that TCR gene clonality with BIOMED-2 multiplex PCR [223] is highly sensitive for detecting T-cell clonality and is useful in predicting response to treatment in EBV-HLH cases [223]. Interestingly, it was found that male patients with EBV-HLH may have mutations in the SH2D1A gene which is classically associated with X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLPS). XLPS is a syndrome of immunodeficiency to EBV virus. Therefore, it is recommended to test for XLPS in male patients with EBV-HLH [224]. It is also recommended to test for other genetic conditions such as fHLH, especially in male patients under 1 year of age, and in those with HLH\nin a sibling or with consanguineous parents, or when HLH is recurrent or unresponsive to treatment.",

In a nationwide survey in Japan to identify prognostic factors in children with EBV-HLH, Kogawa et al. [225] found that most of the clinical and laboratory parameters including EBV load, NK cell activity against EBV-infected cells, and the presence of clonality at the onset of disease were not associated with a poor outcome. Nevertheless, Matsuda et al. showed that change of clonality can be a good marker of disease activity in childhood EBV-HLH [223]. It is also reported that hyperbilirubinemia and hyperferritinemia at the time of diagnosis were significantly associated with a poor outcome. Henter et al. also reported that hyperbilirubinemia and hyperferritinemia at diagnosis, and thrombocytopenia and hyperferritinemia 2 weeks after the initiation of treatment, adversely affect the outcome of HLH [226]. Better outcome is speculated to be associated with going into remission within 8 weeks of treatment initiation [225]. Huang et al. reported that hypoalbuminemia is an independent predictor for HLH in childhood EBV-associated disease [227].",

However, aggressive therapy including immunochemotherapy and allogenic stem cell transplantation has radically improved the prognosis. The optimal treatment strategy [229] for EBV-HLH consists of immunosuppressive medications that inhibit overactive T-cell and NK cell responses [i.e., corticosteroids, cyclosporine A, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), antithymocyte globulins, etoposide, and plasma or blood exchange transfusions] [229, 230]. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the last treatment resort for refractory forms of EBV-HLH, and in the case of EBV infection occurring in genetic forms of HLH [231]. Despite the fact that reports have shown that HSCT is effective in treating patients with refractory EBV-HLH [232], it should be compared to immunochemotherapy in a randomized study to provide evidence for which approach is superior and/or safer [233].",

Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody against CD20 on the surface of B cells. Because EBV targets B cells in the initial phase of the disease, rituximab\u2019s elimination of B cells is thought to inhibit the extent of the infection. In addition, B cells may be a target in EBV-HLH, and rituximab may reduce morbidity and mortality by reducing the circulating B-cell population and the EBV load [234]. Rituximab seems to be most effective in the setting of XLPS patients infected with EBV but is likely less effective when EBV is capable of infecting the T-cell pool. Nonetheless, the addition of rituximab\nto the treatment repertoire of EBV-HLH provides an opportunity to tailor therapy specific to the patient (personalized medicine approach).",

It could either pass undiagnosed or be diagnosed late in the course, or even at autopsy. Neonatal HLH differs from HLH in older children in etiology, manifestations, and laboratory findings. In a nationwide survey in Japan published in 2009, 20 neonates were diagnosed with HLH within 4 weeks after birth; 6 (30%) of them were diagnosed with fHLH, and 6 (30%) were diagnosed with herpes simplex virus-associated HLH (HSV-HLH) [251]. The overall survival rate of these 20 patients was 28.6% for fHLH and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-HLH, and 33.3% for HSV-HLH, despite acyclovir treatment. Although uncommon in HLH of older children, enterovirus (echovirus and coxsackievirus) and HSV have been associated with fatal or fulminant neonatal HLH [252, 253]. This mandates early treatment with high-dose acyclovir in suspected cases without awaiting viral studies results.",

Moreover, autologous and allogeneic HSCT have been reported to induce HLH in transplanted patients, probably due to the increased risk of infection imposed by the immunosuppressive conditioning regimen with an estimated risk of 4% in a recent cohort [333].

Its neutralization has substantially improved survival in HLH animal models [336, 337] and an MAS model using IL-6 transgenic mice [338]. Levels of both IFN-\u03b3 and IFN-\u03b3 -induced chemokines such as CXCL10 and CXCL9 are elevated in children with HLH [339]. Moreover, sJIA-MAS is commonly triggered by viral infections which are known to activate IFN-\u03b3-associated pathways. Furthermore, numerous IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells were found in close proximity to activated hemophagocytic histiocytes in a study of inflammatory infiltrates in tissues affected by MAS [340], and children with MAS show increased levels of neopterin, which is known to be released by interferon-stimulated macrophages [26]. A longitudinal study of the cytokine changes in patients with sJIA showed that levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IFN-\u03b3-induced chemokines (particularly, CXCL9) markedly increased with the beginning of clinical MAS and returned to normal with its resolution. Furthermore, they were strongly correlated with many laboratory features associated with MAS [338]. These findings highlighted IFN-\u03b3 as an appealing targeted and potentially less toxic therapeutic option in HLH, and a clinical trial evaluating NI-0501, which is an anti-IFN-\u03b3 monoclonal antibody that binds to and neutralizes human IFN-\u03b3, is underway [341].

They interfere with the activation of the NF\u03baB pathway and exert both a broad anti-inflammatory effect and antiviral capacities [346, 347]. Based on research in HLH animal models, other targets for future therapy have been proposed. These include the induction of T-cell exhaustion through the stimulation of inhibitory receptors like programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1/PD-1), restoring cytokine balances by the anti-inflammatory IL-10 or IL-18BP, halting chronic TLR activation by TLR antagonists or blocking TLR signaling pathways, and targeting dendritic cells as the main drivers of ongoing antigen stimulation or suppressing antigen presentation itself [348, 349].",

            "text": "Over the past few years, more has been revealed about the role of IL-18 in the pathogenesis of sJIA and MAS. It has been shown that patients with sJIA have significantly higher levels of IL-18 [85\u201387] as opposed to other rheumatic diseases such as SLE or rheumatoid arthritis [350, 351]. sJIA patients with high levels of IL-18 are more likely to develop systemic features of the disease and are more prone to develop MAS [85]. Interestingly, the development of MAS in these patients is associated with a further rise in IL-18 levels [85]. IL-18 has also been found to correlate with ferritin in adult onset Still disease [86]. Therefore, IL-18 has been suggested as a promising biomarker for MAS. Another interesting field of growing research is in the role of IL-18-binding protein (IL-18BP) which is a naturally occurring protein that counter-regulates the activity of IL-18. Imbalance between IL-18 and IL-18BP, leading to higher levels of unbound IL-18, has been found in patients with increased disease severity [33, 86, 352]. The administration of synthetic IL-18BP in perforin-deficient mice infected with murine CMV ameliorated liver damage but has not shown an effect on the pro-inflammatory cytokine levels or on the overall survival [353]. Based on these findings, further work is needed to demonstrate the role of IL-18 and IL-18BP in MAS. Along these lines, IL-18BP was shown to be beneficial in treating refractory MAS in a child with an NLRC4 mutation [354].",
