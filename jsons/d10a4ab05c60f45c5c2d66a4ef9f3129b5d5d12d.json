These genomes were from the viruses causing infections in the earliest recognized phase of the pandemic affecting Houston. Substantial viral genomic diversity was identified, which we interpret to mean that the virus was introduced into Houston many times independently by individuals who had traveled from different parts of the country and the world. The majority of viruses are apparent progeny of strains derived from Europe and Asia. We found no significant evidence of more virulent viral types, stressing the linkage between severe disease, underlying medical conditions, and perhaps host genetics. We discovered a signal of selection acting on the spike protein, the primary target of massive vaccine efforts worldwide. The data provide a critical resource for assessing virus evolution, the origin of new outbreaks, and the effect of host immune response.",

We identified no evidence that a particular strain or its progeny causes more severe disease, underscoring the connection between severe disease, underlying health conditions, and host genetics. Some amino acid replacements in the spike protein suggest positive immune selection is at work in shaping variation in this protein. Our analysis traces the early molecular architecture of SARS-CoV-2 in Houston, and will help us to understand the origin and trajectory of future infection spikes.",

The analysis identified 12 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nsp12, resulting in 11 amino acid replacements throughout the protein ( Table 1) . The most common amino acid change was Pro322Leu, identified in 224 of the 320 Houston isolates. This amino acid replacement is present in genomes from the A2a clade, and distinguishes the A2a clade from other SARS-CoV-2 clades. The other amino acid changes in nsp12 were mainly present in single isolates from individual Houston strains, and some have been identified in other strains in the global GISAID collection (23, 24) . A prominent exception was the identification of 29 strains with a Met600Ile polymorphism. All 29 strains were phylogenetically very closely related members of the A2a clade, and they all also had the P322L amino acid replacement characteristic of this clade (Fig. S8) . These data indicate that the Met600Ile change is the derived state among strains with the Pro322Leu replacement. Importantly, none of the observed amino acid polymorphisms in nsp12 were located precisely at the two sites associated with remdesivir in vitro resistance (20) , and 10 of the 11 polymorphic amino acids are located on the surface of this RdRp. However, importantly, the Ala448Val replacement occurs in an amino acid that is located directly above the nucleotide substrate binding site that is comprised of Lys545, Arg553, and Arg555, as recently shown by structural studies (25, 26) (Fig. 5) . The Ala448 position is comparable to Val553 (Fig. 5) , and a Val553Leu mutation in SARS-CoV was identified to confer resistance to remdesivir (20) .",

Analysis of the gene encoding the S protein identified 41 SNPs, including 25 that produce amino acid changes (Table 2, Fig. 6A ). Seven of these replacements (A263V, F456L, S967R, T1027I, M1050V, K1157M, and Q1208H) are not represented in the GISAID database as of April 15, 2020. F456 makes contact with the human ACE2 receptor, occupying a pocket formed by ACE2 residues Thr27, Asp30 and Lys31 ( Fig. 6B ) (29) . The F456L substitution is expected to detrimentally affect binding to ACE2, as the shorter Leu side chain would not fill the pocket well. We note that seven of the amino acid replacements map to the periphery of the S1 subunit N-terminal domain (NTD). Four of these replacements (A27S, T29I, G261V, and A263V) can be mapped to the recently determined cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (27), whereas three other amino acid changes (L18F, T22I, and H69Y) are located in flexible NTD loops that could not be modeled (Fig. 6A) . The clustering of amino acid replacements to a distinct region of the protein, together with the occurrence of two different amino acid replacements occurring at the same residue is a strong signal of positive selection. Inasmuch as infected patients make antibodies against the NTD region, we favor the idea that host immune selection is a key force contributing to amino acid variation in this region, resulting in an enhanced fitness phenotype of virus variants. Also of note, the D614G replacement was observed in 70% (224 of 320 strains) of the strains sequenced in this study. Residue D614 is located in subdomain 2 (SD-2) of the S protein, and it forms a hydrogen bond and electrostatic interaction with two residues in the S2 subunit of a neighboring protomer (Fig. 6C) . Replacement of aspartate with glycine would eliminate both interactions, thereby substantively weakening the contact between the S1 and S2 subunits. We speculate that this weakening produces a more fusogenic spike protein, because S1 must first dissociate from S2 before the S2 subunit can refold and mediate fusion of viral and cell membranes. Stated another way, virus strains with the D614G variant may be better able to enter host cells, potentially resulting in enhanced spread.",

We found that the African American versus Caucasian populations had a predictive signal, and hence potentially significant SNPs, which may be borne out with increased sampling in these two groups. However, examination of the geographic distribution of the viral isolates classified using this model largely coincided with the demographic distribution of ethnic groups in the Houston metropolitan region.

            "text": "Remdesivir is a nucleoside analog that has been reported to have activity against MERS-CoV, a coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2 (21) . Recently, Grein et al. (22) reported that this drug shows promise in treating COVID-19 patients in a relatively small compassionate use protocol. Because in vitro resistance of SARS-CoV to remdesivir has been reported to be caused by either of two amino acid replacements in RdRp (Phe476Leu and Val553Leu), we interrogated our data for polymorphisms in the nsp12 gene. Although we identified 11 different inferred amino acid replacements in the 320 genomes analyzed, none of these were located at the two positions associated with resistance in vitro. These findings suggest that if remdesivir proves to be efficacious in COVID-19 patients, and is deployed widely as a treatment, the majority of SARS-CoV-2 strains currently circulating should be susceptible to this drug. However, the Ala448Val polymorphism we identified occurs at an amino acid site that intriguingly is located directly above the nucleotide substrate entry channel and nucleotide binding residues Lys545, Arg553, and Arg555 (20, 25) (Fig. 5) . One possibility is that substitution of the smaller alanine residue with the bulkier valine may impose structural constraints for the modified nucleotide analog to bind and thereby disfavor remdesivir binding. This in turn leads to reduced incorporation of remdesivir into the nascent RNA, increased fidelity of RNA synthesis, and thus drug resistance. A similar mechanism has been proposed for a V553L change (20) . We also identified one strain with a Lys477Asn replacement in nsp12. This substitution is located very close to a Phe476Leu replacement reported to produce partial resistance to remdesivir in vitro in SARS-CoV patients from 2004, although the amino acid positions are numbered differently in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Structural studies have suggested that this amino acid is surfaceexposed, and distant from known key functional elements. Our observed Lys477Asn change is also located in a conserved motif described as a finger domain of RdRp (Fig. 5) . One speculative possibility is that Lys477 is involved in binding a yet unidentified cofactor such as nsp7 or nsp8, an interaction that could modify nucleotide binding and/or fidelity at a distance. These data warrant additional study in larger patient cohorts, especially individuals treated with remdesivir.",

Machine learning models were trained to predict patient metadata categories including mortality, length of stay, inpatient versus outpatient status, ICU admission, overall outcome, gender, age, and ethnicity from viral sequence data. Models were trained with the consensus whole genome FASTA files by dividing each viral genome into 15-mer oligonucleotide k-mers, which were used as features to train XGBoost models (38) as described previously (39, 40) . Models were assessed by computing F1 scores for classifiers and R 2 scores for regression models. Unless otherwise stated, data for the first 5folds of a 10-fold cross validation are shown. ",

This trend suggests that public health and laboratory measures to decrease viral spread are showing promise. In Houston, analogous epidemiologic data have recently been reported. If a decreased virus dissemination rate is successfully maintained, it will be especially important to combine traditional public health control approaches (i.e., case identification and contact tracing) with genome sequence information to deconvolute patterns of infection spread. The availability of extensive viral genome data dating from the earliest reported cases of COVID-19 in metropolitan Houston, coupled with the database we have now constructed, may provide important insight into the origin of new infection spikes occurring as social distancing constraints are relaxed and the region begins to re-open. The genome data will also be useful in assessing ongoing molecular evolution in the spike and other proteins, as herd immunity is generated, either by natural exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus or vaccination. The signal of positive selection contributing to diversity in the spike protein is especially concerning and warrants close, intense attention. Materials and Methods Patient specimens. All specimens were obtained from individuals who were registered patients seen at a Houston Methodist Hospital or associated facilities (e.g., urgent care centers) in the greater metropolitan region. Virtually all individuals met the criteria specified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be classified as a person under investigation (PUI). SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing. Specimens obtained from symptomatic patients with a high degree of suspicion for COVID-19 disease were tested in the Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory at Houston Methodist Hospital using an assay granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA (https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medicaldevices/faqs-diagnostic-testing-sars-cov-2#offeringtests). The assay follows the protocol published by the WHO (https://www.who.int/docs/defaultsource/coronaviruse/protocol-v2-1.pdf) and uses the 7500 Fast Dx instrument (ABI) and 7500 SDS software (ABI). Testing was performed on material obtained from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs immersed in universal transport media (UTM), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or sputum treated with dithiothreitol (DTT). To standardize specimen collection, an instructional video was created for Houston Methodist healthcare workers (https://vimeo.com/396996468/2228335d56). Total viral RNA was extracted from patient specimens and tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 with an EZ1 virus extraction kit and EZ1 Advanced XL instrument with the Virus card (Qiagen), or QIASymphony DSP Virus kit and QIASymphony instrument (Qiagen). SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing. Libraries for whole viral genome sequencing were prepared according to version 1 of the ARTIC nCoV-2019 sequencing protocol (https://artic.network/ncov-2019).
