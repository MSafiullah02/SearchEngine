            "text": "Recent experimental evidence suggests that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are implicated in the pathophysiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI) by increasing blood\u2013brain barrier permeability and exacerbating post-traumatic edema. MMPs are zinc-dependent and cell surface-associated endopeptidases that cleave all extracellular matrix (ECM) components, including collagen, laminin, and proteoglycans. The MMPs and their potential deleterious effects are tightly regulated at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels through proform activation and by MMP tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) Two members of this family have a very specific and marked activity against gelatin and are termed gelatinases. In vitro studies have demonstrated that the secretion of gelatinases is significantly increased in cortical cultures when mechanical injury is simulated. In human TBI, data about the presence of gelatinases in the brain extracellular fluid (ECF) and their temporal profile, both in plasma and ECF, are still lacking. Sahuquillo\u2019s group [1] examined the acute profile of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the plasma of patients with moderate or severe TBI and, more interestingly, in the brain extracellular fluid (ECF). High levels of gelatinases were found in plasma and brain ECF in the early phase of TBI, indicating that both local and systemic trauma-induced upregulation of gelatinases in the acute phase might play an important role in the pathophysiology of TBI and could be a future therapeutic target.",

Mauritz [3] described ICP use in a sample of 1,856 severe TBI from a registry of patients admitted to Austrian ICUs between 1998 and 2004. Mauritz aimed to investigate reasons why patients did or did not receive ICP monitoring and to describe factors influencing hospital mortality after severe TBI. The ad hoc created statistical model explains only 37% of the variance of the use of ICP monitoring, but clearly showed that severity and age are importantly associated with ICP monitoring. The more severe, as the less injured, cases were less likely to be submitted to ICP. That is likely to reflect a clinical judgment concerning who can benefit from invasive monitoring. An evaluation of potential salvageability is part of the decisional analysis. Interestingly, no clear, standardized definition of \u201csalvageability\u201d is available. Older patients are less often monitored. The second aim of the paper was to analyze the impact of several predictors, including ICP monitoring, on mortality at hospital discharge. The study confirms a clear association between the number of cases treated by center per year and better outcome. This supports the benefit of centralization, as shown in TBI and other neurological non-traumatic pathologies. Finally, an additional result was that the subgroup with the highest rate of ICP monitoring had the lowest mortality suggesting a utility of monitoring and treating high ICP.",

Between others, the relationship between optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) and ICP in neurocritical care patients has been explored [4]. A significant relationship between ONSD and ICP was recorded. Changes in ICP were strongly correlated with changes in ONSD. Enlarged ONSD was a suitable predictor of elevated ICP. Even if the studied cohort was limited, non-invasive measurements were correlated with invasive ICP. This method, once validated in a wider number of patients, could be used as a screening test when raised ICP is suspected.",

HICP is frequent; 153 patients had at least 1 day of ICP>20 mmHg. Early surgery was necessary for 221 cases, and standard medical therapy [sedation, mannitol, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) withdrawal, PaCO2 30\u201335 mmHg] was used in 135 patients. Reinforced treatment (PaCO2 25\u201329 mmHg, induced arterial hypertension, muscle relaxants) was used in 179 cases (44%), and second-tier therapies in 80 (20%). Surgical decompression and/or barbiturates were used in 28 of 407 cases (7%). Six-month outcome was favorable (good recovery or moderate disability) in 195 cases (53%). HICP was associated with worse outcome. Outcome for cases who had received second-tier therapies was significantly worse (43% favorable at 6 months, P = 0.03). Therefore, HICP is frequent and is associated with worse outcome. The indications for surgical decompression and/or barbiturates seem restricted to less than 10% of severe TBI.",

The Authors in a prospective, nonrandomized, single-center study, explored whether hyperglycemia exerts deleterious effects via cerebral energy metabolism and the effects of cerebral high/low glucose in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. In all patients a microdialysis catheter was inserted. Cerebral low-glucose episodes and high-glucose episodes occurred independently of blood glucose levels. During high-glucose episodes cerebral microdialysate levels were normal, while cerebral low glucose, occurring more frequently in symptomatic patients, was associated with severe cellular distress, i.e., increase in lactate/pyruvate ratio, glutamate, glycerol and with unfavorable outcome. Cerebral low glucose was associated with severe metabolic distress and may present a target for therapy to improve clinical outcome. Tight glycemic control could be deleterious in this neurological population.",

The results suggest, in the absence of a control group, that the ratio increases after etomidate administration and is associated with a diminished rise in circulating cortisol upon ACTH.

The authors thus investigated the relation between the adrenal production of gluco- and mineralo-corticoids, inflammatory status and outcome in critically ill patients with liver cirrhosis. They included 50 consecutive patients with liver cirrhosis and applied a corticotropin stimulation test within 12 h following ICU admission. Hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism syndrome was defined as basal renin over aldosterone ratio (RRA) higher than 2. They found impaired adrenal function in 41 (82%) patients. 26 patients (52%) presented with an RRA >2. Patients with RRA >2 exhibited greater disease severity and organ dysfunction scores at baseline, but risk-adjusted mortality rates were not different between the two groups. Renin and IL-6 plasma concentrations were positively correlated. A Cox regression analysis revealed hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism syndrome, IL-6 higher than 400 pg/ml and severe renal failure to be independent predictors of 30-day mortality. The authors concluded that adrenal dysfunction was common in critically ill cirrhotic patients. Hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism syndrome was related to a greater pro-inflammatory status and degree of acute organ failure, and was independently associated with a worse prognosis.",

Patients kept on midazolam and morphine had a significantly slower gastric emptying as compared to patients kept om propofol. The result clearly calls for a larger prospective randomized study. The cumulated energy deficit in ICU patients primarily on enteral nutrition, which has been reported in several studies, is mainly related to underfeeding during the initial week of ICU stay. Desachy et al. [36] report of a prospective randomized study in 100 consecutive patients given enteral nutrition introduced stepwise or all at once. Success rate in terms of calories delivered was significantly better in the groups given the full dose of enteral nutrition from start. That group had a larger fraction of gastric residues >300 ml, but the rate of adverse events necessitating complementary parenteral nutrition was similar in the two groups. Adverse effects related to the use of prokinetic therapy was reported by Nguyen et al.

The authors used the GRADE system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations. Key recommendations, listed by category, include: early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 h after recognition (1C); blood cultures prior to antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm potential source of infection (1C); administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 1 h of diagnosis of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1D); reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate (1C); a usual 7\u201310 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response (1D); source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method (1C); administration of either crystalloid or colloid fluid resuscitation (1B); fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure (1C); reduction in rate of fluid administration with rising filling pressures and no improvement in tissue perfusion (1D); vasopressor preference for norepinephrine or dopamine to maintain an initial target of mean arterial pressure > or =65 mm Hg (1C); dobutamine inotropic therapy when cardiac output remains low despite fluid resuscitation and combined inotropic/vasopressor therapy (1C); stress-dose steroid therapy given only in septic shock after blood pressure is identified to be poorly responsive to fluid and vasopressor therapy (2C); recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and clinical assessment of high risk for death (2B except 2C for post-operative patients). In the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage, target a hemoglobin of 7\u20139 g/dl (1B); a low tidal volume (1B) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy (1C) for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury (1C); head of bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); avoiding routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in ALI/ARDS (1A); to decrease days of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ALI/ARDS who are not in shock (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia (1B); using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions or lightening (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible (1B); institution of glycemic control (1B) targeting a blood glucose <150 mg/dl after initial stabilization (2C); equivalency of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1A); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper GI bleeding using H2 blockers (1A) or proton pump inhibitors (1B); and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate (1D). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points (2C); dopamine as the first drug of choice for hypotension (2C); steroids only in children with suspected or proven adrenal insufficiency (2C); a recommendation against the use of recombinant activated protein C in children (1B). The authors concluded that evidenced-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the first step toward improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.",

The investigators demonstrated that circulating osteopontin could be used as a marker of IL-6 release and of sepsis (vs. SIRS), even though the levels were elevated in SIRS (vs. control) as well. Osteopontin appeared capable of increasing IL-6 secretion by macrophages in vitro. It is unclear how specific the findings were for microbial infection, however. Dulhunty et al. [43] reported on a multi-center study (n = 3,543 patients) done in Australia and New Zealand to answer the question whether severe non-infectious SIRS differs from severe sepsis in the ICU, regarding epidemiological issues. Even though mortality rates were similar, severe non-septic SIRS was more common and more often associated with neurological abnormalities and causes of death, than severe sepsis. This study adds to the idea that infection per se is not a major determinant of patient outcome, in contrast to the response of the body to either non-infectious or infectious threats.",

By multivariate analysis, previous chemotherapy was protective. After adjustment with a propensity score for recent chemotherapy, chemotherapy was not associated with outcome.",

The first was, what is the current probability that activated protein C is not better than the control? and, if the current probability is not small, then the second question was, how many patients will be needed for the activated protein C confirmatory trial? To give an adequate response to these questions, the authors used a Bayesian statistical approach. The P value commonly used in frequentist statistical methods only tell us how likely we will observe the reported data when the null hypothesis is true, but does not tell us the actual probability of treatment effect. Bayesian methodology, however, can provide this actual (or current) probability. To do this, all available data is selected for the prior probability. The prior distributions were defined as severe skeptic, moderate skeptic, mild skeptic and enthusiastic. The authors found that, except for the enthusiastic analysis, the current probabilities that activated protein C is not better than the control are not small (range, 0.14-0.48). The number of patients needed for a confirmatory trial ranged between 0 and 8,350. The authors concluded that a confirmatory trial with about 600 patients with severe sepsis and high risk of death can provide a convincing answer for moderate and mild skeptic physicians regarding the efficacy of the drug.",

In order to re-assess the influence of antibiotics on the value of various BAL cytological parameters in diagnosing VAP, Linssen et al. [82] studied 335 episodes of clinically suspected VAP in 282 patients. There was no difference in areas under the curve (AUCs) of receiver operating characteristic curves between patients with and without antibiotic therapy for any parameter studied. The most prominent AUCs were: total cell count, 0.65; percentage polymorphonuclear neutrophils, 0.71; and percentage infected cells, 0.90. Based on these data, it appears that the percentage of infected cells in BALF can be reliably used for diagnosing VAP in patients receiving antibiotic therapy, provided that the introduction of the new antibiotics was recent (less than 72 h).",

            "text": "VAP remains a major problem in intensive care units and effective preventive measures are eagerly searched for. The presence of an endotracheal tube (ETT) not only compromises the natural barrier between the oropharynx and trachea, but also provides a protected environment for pathogens since a biofilm develops on its inner and outer surfaces. In an attempt to prevent bacterial colonization of the lower respiratory tract in patients requiring mechanical ventilation, Berra et al. [83] developed a polyurethane ETT coated with silver sulfadiazine. In a second study, the same group of investigators randomized 46 adult patients to be intubated with a standard non-coated ETT, or with a silver sulfadiazine-coated ETT [84]. Coating with silver sulfadiazine prevented bacterial colonization of the ETT and was associated with a thinner mucus layer. Although preliminary, these data support the hypothesis that an endotracheal tube coated externally and internally with a potent antiseptic product such as silver could exert a sustained antimicrobial effect within the proximal airways and block biofilm formation at its surface.",
