Chromosomal integration explains the positive ME panel results for 3 patients who tested positive for ciHHV-6, but most patients did not undergo ciHHV-6 testing, so the total number with chromosomal integration could not be ascertained. With regard to subclinical reactivation, 3 of these 12 patients were immunosuppressed, and the majority of the remaining patients presented with severe acute illness, which could also cause viral reactivation. In 1 study, HHV-6 reactivation was demonstrated in 54 of 101 critically ill patients (53%) admitted to the intensive care unit, compared with 0 of 50 healthy volunteers (0%) [7].
