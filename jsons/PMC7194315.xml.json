A number of articles have been published describing recommended ethical and clinical principles for triaging and allocating ventilators to individual patients.10,13-16 In addition to surveillance and epidemiologic data, the same ethical principles relevant to allocating ventilators to individuals during times of scarcity can also inform decisions about how to allocate ventilators to facilities. In a pandemic, if resources are scarce, plans and protocols will need to shift from an individual patient care outcome perspective to a population-based focus and must be grounded in a principled allocation of resources that attempts to ensure equity and fairness.",

However, it may not be possible to develop a plan that will meet all patients' needs in future scenarios.13Transparency: State and local planners should share planning guidelines with hospitals and other facilities, partners, and stakeholders and seek public comment and incorporate public values into planning efforts.17 Public health officials should prepare to explain to the public the rationale and purpose of ventilator allocation decisions.Distributive justice: During an emergency when there are insufficient services and/or equipment to meet the needs of all, efforts should be focused on allocation to facilities that can save the greatest number of lives. Balancing distributive fairness and efficiency is extremely difficult even with advance planning.10,14,18Duty to care: Once a provider-patient relationship is formed, providers have the obligation to care for their patients, and the care they provide should be aligned with what a \u201creasonable physician\u201d would provide under the circumstances during an emergency.15 If ventilators are insufficient to meet the needs of all those who would benefit from them, then plans should include other means of providing curative and palliative care for these patients.14 Healthcare facilities in a community that collaborate using a \u201csystems approach\u201d to plan for a pandemic may be able to develop community-level plans that designate specific facilities for patient care during a pandemic to improve outcomes.19Duty to steward resources: Allocation consideration should include sending limited resources, like ventilators, to facilities that can make the best use of the equipment.6Equity: To achieve fairness, the same allocation framework should be used to allocate stockpiled ventilators to all facilities in a jurisdiction, taking into consideration facilities' needs and available supply. The concepts of equity and consideration for vulnerable populations should be included in ventilator allocation plans.",

Ideally, planning ahead would provide jurisdictions with a baseline assessment of the ability of healthcare facilities in their jurisdiction to absorb and deploy additional supplies of ventilators. At the time of a pandemic response, the impact of disease (severity of illness, transmission), the effectiveness of mechanical ventilation at preserving life given the specific pandemic pathogen, and the population subgroups most affected who may need mechanical ventilation will all factor into allocation decisions. Using ethical principles to assess need, determine ability to absorb additional ventilators, and ensure resources to the most vulnerable populations, state and local public health officials can equitably allocate stockpiled ventilators during a pandemic. Having strategies for allocating scarce resources like ventilators in advance may improve decision making, with the understanding that plans will need to adapt to the realities presented during a pandemic response.",
