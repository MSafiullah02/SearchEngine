(1980) and Gordon and Ruddle (1981). This technique has been applied to the production of transgenic livestock. Using mammary gland-specific promoters, a wide range of proteins of biopharmaceutical interest have been expressed in rodents, pigs, and dairy animals. An expression vector, comprising a gene encoding the target protein of interest fused to a milk promoter gene, is introduced by microinjection into the pronucleus of a one-cell embryo. Upon germ line integration and expression, the transgene becomes a dominant Mendelian genetic characteristic that is inherited by the progeny of the founder animal. The transgenic offspring may express the target protein in gram per liter quantities, most frequently as a soluble whey protein. Mammalian mammary epithelial cells have the capacity to carry out complex protein synthesis with a variety of posttranslational modifications and proper folding. Coexpression of modifying enzymes in the epithelial cell Golgi apparatus may allow the heterologous protein to be engineered to confer specific or desired pharmacokinetic characteristics. The milk of transgenic livestock presents an excellent starting material from which human diagnostic or pharmaceutically active, therapeutic proteins may be purified using established technologies of the dairy and biopharmaceutical industries.",

Many recombinant proteins of interest in human therapy are, by their very nature, biologically active in most mammals. The murine model is useful in determining, at an early stage of research, the transgene expression characteristics and potential effects on animal health. Transgenic mice are generally predictive of what will be observed in larger animals. Many transgenic proteins have been expressed in the milk of transgenic livestock. Table 1\nsummarizes the published results of expression in transgenic farm animals during the period from 1990 to 1996. Several of these proteins have been expressed at high levels, demonstrating the usefulness of the production system. Examination of a great number of transgenic lines has shown that mammary gland-specific expression of a target protein is associated with increased plasma levels of this protein, even in the absence of ectopic expression. The most likely explanation is leakage of the protein from the milk into the circulation through the junctional complexes of the mammary epithelial cells. Therefore, certain proteins and peptides, such as highly active hormones and cytokines, cannot be expressed in the mammary system as their secretion into the blood may have severe detrimental effects on the host.",

These transgenes are usually chimeric, being derived from the fusion of a target protein gene and mammary-specific regulatory sequences. Although both genomic DNAs and cDNAs coding for target proteins have been used for expression, higher levels are normally obtained with genomic DNAs. The incorporation of untranslated exons and introns may contribute to increased expression of the transgene (Whitelaw et al., 1991). Addition of a signal sequence is necessary if the exogenous protein is not normally secreted. This will cause the protein to be secreted out of the mammary tissue into the milk.",

WAP is present in the milk of mouse, rat, rabbit, and camel, but is absent from the milk of cow, sheep, pig, goat, and human. No recognizable WAP gene homologues have been isolated from these species. Rat (Wei et al., 1995, Yarus et al., 1997), mouse (Gordon et al., 1987; Ebert et al., 1991, Reddy et al., 1991; Velander et al., 1992; Drohan et al., 1994; Hansson et al., 1994; Limonta et al., 1995), and rabbit (Bischoff et al., 1992; Devinoy et al., 1994; Th\u00e9pot et al., 1995) WAP regulatory sequences have been used to direct expression of exogenous proteins to the mammary gland. High-level expression of the target protein was observed with mouse and rabbit WAP transgenes. Surprisingly, relatively high expression levels (up to 1 g/liter) were observed in transgenic pigs with a construct containing 2.6 kb of 5\u2032 and 1.3 kb of 3\u2032 mouse WAP sequences linked to a human protein C cDNA (Velander et al., 1992). This result seems to indicate that m WAP regulatory sequences can function efficiently in species that do not have an endogenous WAP gene.",

Cow fetuses obtained following nuclear transfer of ES cell-derived nuclei in recipient oocytes died in utero, exhibiting major defects in placental development (Stice et al., 1996). In sheep, the first large animals derived from cultured cells were described in 1996 by Campbell et al. Two healthy phenotypicaly female lambs were born from embryos generated by transferring nuclei isolated from embryo-derived cells into enucleated oocytes. DNA analysis demonstrated that all the nuclear transfer lambs and fetuses were derived from the cell line. It is not yet clear whether foreign DNA can be introduced in this type of cell line, and there are questions about the health and reproductive fitness of the recovered offspring.

Initial reports indicate that human glycoproteins expressed in the mammary gland of transgenic animals contain glycosylation patterns that differ from those found on human plasma-derived proteins. In general, the glycosylation found on human proteins secreted into transgenic animal milk has been generally similar to plasma protein glycosylation. Sites are mainly biantennary complex oligosaccharides with some variations consistent with the tissue and species of origin. Cole et al. (1994) have shown that human antithrombin III (AT III) and a long-acting form of htPA expressed in goat milk had some GalNAc replacing galactose on complex N-linked oligosaccharides. Both LAtPA and AT III were shown to be more fucosylated than their recombinant or plasma counterparts. Goat plasma AT III contains N-glycolylneuraminic acid and N-acetylneuraminic acid, as do transgenically expressed AT III and LAtPA. An additional difference observed between plasma and transgenic goat AT III is in the degree of sialylation (Edmunds et al., 1994), with the transgenic protein less sialylated than plasma AT III. Denman et al., (1991) have also noted that significantly lower levels of galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, and sialic acid are present in goat transgenic LAtPA compared to the murine C 127 cell line and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell-derived LAtPA.",

In the sow they are located along the thoracic, abdominal, and inguinal walls. Streak canals link the internal milk secretory system with the external environment. The number of teats, teat orientation, and length of the let-down reflex affect the ease and periodicity of milking. Milk is released as a result of a neuroendocrine reflex of the nervous system to tactile, auditory, and visual stimuli. Negative psychological and environmental disturbances have a detrimental effect on milk production. Milk let-down is a response to the release of oxytocin, synthesized in the hypothalamus, by the posterior pituitary gland. Oxytocin is transported to the mammary gland in the arterial blood and binds to myoepithelial cells that contract, causing a release or let-down of the milk. Sheep and goats have let-down periods of 1\u20132 and 2\u20134 min, respectively. The let-down reflex in the cow lasts for 5\u20138 min.

No transmission of scrapie has ever been reported in humans. Milk and semen are noninfectious for scrapie according to the World Health Organization (1996). Although scrapie has been detected in significant numbers of sheep in the United States, only five goat scrapie cases have occurred in goats, all comingled with scrapie-infected sheep. The use of animals from closed, scrapie-free herds or flocks has been adopted by the leading transgenic production companies to obviate any such concerns. Goat viruses relevant in North America are shown in Table 4\n.",
