These materials have an impressive application potential in optics, electronics, catalysis and medicines [1], [2], [3]. Rhule et al. published a review and described the applications of HPAs in medicines [4]. HPAs have been shown to exhibit antiviral activity against several RNA viruses including the orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, flaviviruses, coronaviruses, retroviruses, different influenza strains, Dengue fever virus and SARS coronavirus [5], [6], [7]. Also, HPAs have been investigated as promising anti-HIV [8] and anti-cancer agents [9], [10]. The activity of HPAs is dependent on their particle size. A novel method for synthesis of HPAs with nanometer size was introduced in this work for the first time.",

These polymers are including poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) [15], [16], [17], poly(vinyl methyl ether) (PVME) [18], and poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEOePPOePEO) tri-block copolymers [19]. These polymers have a distinctive lower critical solution temperature (LCST) and are water insoluble at temperatures above their LCSTs. In water, PNIPAM hydrogels show a negative volume response to temperature, due to a phase transition occurs in the polymer configuration: they maintain a swollen (hydrophilic) state at low temperature, while they shrink remarkably to a collapsed (hydrophobic) state when the temperature is raised above 32 \u00b0C, which is PNIPAM's lower critical solution temperature [20]. Due to the dramatic volume phase transition properties, PNIPAM-based hydrogel has been used in the thermo-responsive controlled release [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], protein adsorption and heavy metal ion adsorbent, cell detachment and so on [27], [28], [29], [30].",

It is well known that the solubility of PIPA in aqueous solution reduces with increasing temperature [6]. PIPA has been reported to have a lower critical solution temperature which is near 32 \u00b0C in water, based on viscosity, light scattering, and DSC studies [5]. As it is shown, PMAn was released much faster by increasing the temperature from 35 to 55 \u00b0C (Fig. 6a), or increasing the strength of magnetic field from 500 to 570 G (Fig. 6b). This can be explained by the fact that the solubility is decreased due to a weakening of the ordering effect of the water\u2013amide hydrogen bonds between the polymers as the temperature increases [20]. The data from Fig. 6c and d suggest that the PIPA gel in the Fe3O4@silica pores swells below the LCST (32 \u00b0C), and thus the PMAn in the silica\u2013PIPA gel cannot easily permeate through the pore. Above the LCST (32 \u00b0C) the PIPA gel shrinks so that PMAn can easily be released through the pore.",
