Significant changes are expected in the economic system as well as in the social sphere inducing a series of research challenges (Mariani and Borghi, 2019; Caviggioli and Ughetto, 2019). Central to this growing body of literature is the assumption that Industry 4.0 has paradigmatic properties that make it comparable to previous industrial revolutions (e.g., Steenhuis and Pretorius, 2017; Li et al., 2018; Yin et al., 2018; Kim, 2018). The nature of these properties is however still questioned against ongoing technological uncertainties, early implementation examples, and late macro-economic indicators (Brynjolffson and McAffee, 2016; OECD, 2017).",

The Internet of Things (IoT) has mostly been investigated by research on business model innovation. Closer relationships between manufacturers and broad ecosystems of software developers, technology and service providers have been posited (e.g., Rogers et al., 2016; Ehret and Wirtz, 2017; Rymaszewska et al., 2017) together with increasing commoditization of physical products and falling industry boundaries (e.g., Porter and Heppelmann, 2014; 2015; Iansiti and Lakhani, 2014). Supply chain management research has more recently focused on the blockchain technology and its disintermediation effects (e.g., Chang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019a).",

This is only partially motivated by the rapid transformative developments characterizing Industry 4.0 today (Drath and Horch, 2014; Frank et al., 2019a); other reasons lie the way the issue has been approached so far. First, Industry 4.0 technologies have been mostly analyzed individually; this focus \u2013 although beneficial for isolating initial hypotheses \u2013 does not reflect their aggregate effects (e.g., Chiarello et al., 2018; Mariani and Borghi, 2019; Culot et al., In Press). Second, the literature has been developing within specific streams of research, largely neglecting the long-debated interdependencies between competitive strategy and operations configuration (e.g., Skinner, 1969; Hayes and Wheelwright, 1984; Chen and Paulraj, 2004). Third \u2013 with few exceptions \u2013 impacts have been investigated from the perspective of the focal company and its first-tier relations, whereas evolutionary phenomena are characterized by the embeddedness of individual decisions and outcomes in larger networks of business relations (e.g., Granovetter, 1985; Gulati et al., 2000; Choi et al., 2001; McFarland and Payan, 2008; Pagani and Pardo, 2017).",

The analysis was based on the principles of interpretative research (Smith, 1983; Prasad and Prasad, 2002). As a result, we provide a comprehensive overview of which configurations are to be expected under the Industry 4.0 paradigm and raise questions on some impacts that, although broadly discussed in the literature, were perceived as controversial by the expert panel. The link between contextual drivers and future configurations is made explicit in eight scenarios.",

Today, Industry 4.0 appears to be an umbrella construct \u2013 as per Hirsch and Levin (1999) \u2013 and is broadly used (to account) for various emerging technologies and related practices in manufacturing and beyond (Oesterreich and Teutemberg, 2016; Mariani and Borghi, 2019). \u201cDigital transformation\u201d, \u201csmart manufacturing\u201d, and the \u201cfourth industrial revolution\u201d are other terms also commonly used to describe the phenomenon.",

Several studies have suggested a relationship between Industry 4.0 and reshoring \u2013 i.e., the decision to bring those production activities back home or to neighbouring countries, which had previously been offshored due to lower labor intensity and higher digital maturity in developed countries (Morandlou and Tate, 2018; Barbieri et al., 2017). These hypotheses have found initial empirical confirmation in Fratocchi (2018), Ancarani et al. (2019), Dachs et al. (2019) and Stentoft and Rajkumar (2019). The increasing applicability of AMTs has imparted new impetus to research on redistributed manufacturing \u2013 i.e., a model of localized production involving many small or micro-scale manufacturing facilities (e.g. Rauch et al., 2017; Hannibal and Knight, 2018). The model is currently being piloted in specific segments, such as 3D-printed spare parts (e.g., Cherukov et al., 2018).",

The impact on production activities, on the other hand, is not clear. Outsourcing might increase because of easier digital coordination with suppliers (Strange and Zucchella, 2017), the need to access specialized capabilities for customization purposes (Gress and Kalafski, 2015; LaPlume et al., 2016), and digital platforms providing ready access to manufacturing capabilities (Berman, 2012; Rehnberg and Ponte, 2018).

Whereas product innovation is triggering the entrance of new players across several manufacturing industries, in the future a higher concentration is to be expected due to technological standardization (Yun et al., 2016). Different speculations have been made as regards to production activities. On the one hand, consolidation trends seem to be supported by the need to guarantee higher service levels because of mass customization, by AMTs cutting out component suppliers and contract manufacturers and also by the pursuit of cost synergies in the light of the increasing price transparency of online sales channels (Tziantopoulos et al., 2019; Rehnberg and Ponte, 2018; Holmstr\u00f6m et al., 2016). On the other hand, it has been argued that AMTs and digital coordination technologies will provide more opportunities to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to network with large players for mass customization, spare parts and localized production (Braziotis et al., 2019; Gress and Kalafski, 2015).",

            "text": "In order to provide a comprehensive overview of the configuration trajectories affecting manufacturing VCs, three further streams of literature should also be mentioned. The first one is related to the growing academic interest around technological platforms. The current debate on Industry 4.0 in manufacturing has only partially been influenced by the \u201ceconomic perspective\u201d of platform research so far (Gawer, 2014; McIntyre and Srinivisan, 2017), the main focus being on manufacturers sponsoring technological platforms to engage with third-party complementors. The increasing prevalence of platform-based approaches raises, however, further questions concerning demand dynamics (e.g., Bryonlfsson et al., 2010), cross-industry consolidation trends (e.g., Eisenmann et al., 2011; Ruutu et al., 2017) as well as potential direct competition between platforms and manufacturers (e.g., Zhu and Liu, 2018). The second stream of research is related to data management for value creation in the era of big data (e.g., Davenport, 2017; Iansiti and Lahkani, 2020; Hagiu and Wright, 2020; Spiekermann and Korunustovska, 2017). In these studies, attention has been placed on understanding how different types of data represent a source of competitive advantage, an issue that has been tackled only marginally in the research investigating IoT-enabled business models in manufacturing. The third and last stream is also related to the data issue, where some studies have also investigated emerging business models and concentration dynamics of technology providers in the IoT (Metallo et al., 2018; Basaure et al., In press) and in the big data industries (e.g., Urbinati et al., 2019; Nuccio and Guerzoni, 2019).",

            "text": "Overall, the current understanding of the paradigmatic properties of Industry 4.0 is still unclear and \u2013 to a certain extent \u2013 ambivalent. Part of the issue is related to the fact that, today, researchers are clearly confronted with mostly exemplary cases of large-scale technology implementation (e.g., Hofmann and R\u00fcsch, 2017; OECD, 2017; World Economic Forum, 2019) and business model innovation (Bughin and van Zeebroeck, 2017; Weking et al., In Press). Academics investigating how companies \u2013 usually the most advanced ones \u2013 are configuring for Industry 4.0 have identified emerging trajectories and provided managers with insights on actual opportunities, but inevitably failed to describe the nature of the new paradigm and thus to make explicit the range of options and implications. Moreover, business models, ecosystems and supply chains analyzed from the point of view of focal firms did not consider the implications of parallel transformative evolutions in upstream and downstream manufacturing industries as well as in adjacent sectors. Although some scholars have approached the issue with broader analytical scope and greater future orientation (e.g., Jiang et al., 2017; Opresnik and Taisch, 2015; Hannibal and Knight, 2018), there still remain significant knowledge gaps. The main gap is probably related to the narrow focus of these studies: it is still not possible to fully grasp cross technological effects and the interdependencies between competitive and operations strategy (e.g., Skinner, 1969; Hayes and Wheelwright, 1984; Chen and Paluraj, 2004) as technologies and specific impacts have been examined separately so far.",

The single activities vary by industry and are normally identified through the analysis of a VC input-output structure as individual firms are producers/users of inputs to/from other firms (Hopkins and Wallerstein, 1994). Activities typically included are research and development, raw material and technology supply, upstream and downstream manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sales. In line with well-established concepts in the study of supply chains (e.g., Hayes and Wheelwright, 1984; Lambert et al., 1998; Choi et al., 2001; Carter et al., 2015), we considered both physical and support activities. The two inner boxes in the conceptual model specifically differentiate activities related to value transformation \u2013 i.e., the production of physical goods and related services \u2013 from those involving value intermediation \u2013 i.e., the transfer of value between different stages of the VC and ultimately to the consumer. At this level of analysis, we adopted the typical lenses of industrial organization (IO) economy as it developed from its early days (e.g., Mason, 1939; Bain, 1956). We considered business models and new entrants (2A), the level of concentration (2B), and the barriers to entry (2C). Moreover, because reshoring and redistributed manufacturing emerged as key topics in the literature, we also included the geographical location (2D) of activities as a topic for investigation.",

In order to further ensure rigor in the selection process (Landeta, 2006), the questionnaire included three self-rating questions on the perceived level of knowledgeability, i.e., familiarity with the specific industry (Apparel and Footwear, Automotive, Machinery and Equipment), with Industry 4.0, and with VC configuration issues.

The abundant literature on mass customization in operations and supply chain management provides the starting point (e.g., Fogliatto et al., 2012; Suzi\u0107 et al., 2018). In the first two scenarios \u2013 (1) Production commoditization and (2) End-to-end VC transparency \u2013 high levels of data transparency enable efficient outsourcing due to a decrease in transaction costs (Coarse, 1937; Williamson 1987). In scenario (1) a low AMTs\u2019 asset specificity makes suppliers virtually interchangeable (McGuiness, 1994; Lonsdale, 2001). This, in turn, leads to price pressures, commoditization of production, and efficiency-seeking efforts. As a result, a process of market consolidation takes place; new manufacturing giants operate a broad network of localized production facilities. In scenario (2) End-to-End VC transparency focal companies orchestrate articulated supply chains of specialized manufacturers of intermediate goods. The core dynamics of this scenario are explained through the resource dependency theory (Donaldson, 2001): because of specialized capabilities, suppliers have at their disposal high bargaining power against the focal company, maintain high barriers to entry, and retain some of the extra profit related to customization. The remaining two \u201ccustomization\u201d scenarios are based on the opposing logic for outsourcing. Data-related transaction costs make it inconvenient for focal companies to coordinate suppliers within very short time intervals, which is needed required for customization. The higher margins related to customized products drive production internalization in scenario (3) In-house production. In case AMTs and advanced robotics will not be available \u2013 as in scenario (4) In-house technology \u2013 focal companies are incentivized to invest in proprietary technology in order to reduce the labor-intensity of production processes.",

Central to our line of reasoning is the literature on manufacturing servitization (e.g., Baines and Lightfoot, 2014; Berret et al., 2015; Story et al., 2017) as well as the ever-growing research on platforms, both from an \u201ceconomic\u201d and an \u201cengineering design\u201d perspective (e.g., Gawer, 2014; McIntyre and Srinivasan, 2017). The \u201cengineering design\u201d perspective \u2013 i.e., platforms as technological architectures to orchestrate a set of system complementors (e.g., Elorata and Turunen, 2016; Ondrus et al., 2016; Wei et al., 2019; Broekhuizen et al., In press) \u2013 is at the basis of scenario (5) Open smart ecosystems. Industry 4.0 solutions demand high interdependencies of competences and technological complementarity, thus often give rise to innovation ecosystems (e.g. Benitez et al., In press). In this scenario highly specialized players are involved through IoT platforms based on an open architecture. Data transparency offers relatively equal opportunities for value capture to the various firms involved. The \u201ceconomic perspective\u201d of platform research \u2013 i.e., platforms as multi-sided markets (e.g., Eisenmann et al., 2011; Cennamo and Santalo, 2013; Ghazawneh and Henfridsson, 2015) \u2013 is the most relevant for scenario (6) Platform-based renting/leasing. This scenario describes a situation where platforms become the dominant models in value intermediation. In a regime of high data transparency, low barriers to entry prevent \u201cwinner takes all\u201d dynamics. In both scenarios (5) and (6) high data transparency coupled with cross-industry market ecosystems triggers the commoditization of data management activities. Scenario (7) In-house smart servitization describes a head-to-head competition among industry incumbents, digital players and intermediaries. Manufacturers orchestrate their own IoT platform-based architectures and build up a competitive advantage through the ownership of product in-use data and the internalization of sales channels together with core services. Digital players and intermediaries capitalize on their access to customer data and invest in their own IoT product-service architectures so as to grow across different industries. In the last scenario \u2013 (8) Enhanced renting/leasing \u2013 traditional products are offered as a service. In a regime of low data transparency manufacturers and intermediaries internalize services that guarantee extra profit.",

Based on an extensive analysis of the literature, a series of workshops, and a Delphi study involving 76 experts (academics and practitioners), we identified the key dimensions of change (Section 2 and 3) and assessed their relevance by 2030 (Section 4). Starting from these analyses, we put forward an analytical perspective presented in the form of drivers and scenarios (Section 5).",

First, it promotes a cross-disciplinary debate drawing from different streams of research that have investigated the issue separately so far. The study links literature in operations and supply chain management with strategy and business model research, including broad-range considerations on topics such as manufacturing servitization, mass customization, technological platforms and multi-sided markets, reshoring, and redistributed manufacturing. Second, our results describe the emerging paradigmatic characteristics of Industry 4.0, building on the assessment of expert academics and practitioners. This description confirms some dynamics highlighted in the literature, while putting into perspective other evolutionary trajectories, such as new production models, reshoring and individual prosumers. Third, the formulation of eight scenarios (see Figure 3) presents a range of possible futures, making explicit how Industry 4.0 is prone to different context-specific variations that can be traced back to four key drivers, namely demand characteristics, transparency of data among value chain participants, maturity of additive manufacturing and advanced robotics, and penetration of smart products.",

As we explained in the methodology section, the study was carried out in collaboration with the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), which was involved in the identification of the research question as well as in various brainstorming and validation sessions. Starting from here, the conceptual model (Figure 2) and the list of projections (Table 2) can be used in strategic planning exercises as an assessment tool by companies, business associations, consulting firms, or regions/countries to identify future scenarios specific for a particular company, sector and/or geographical area. The four drivers identified as determinants of the different future scenarios (i.e., demand characteristics, transparency of data among value chain participants, maturity of additive manufacturing and advanced robotics, and penetration of smart products) might also be considered separately to delve into the most compelling uncertainties behind strategy formulation. The projections \u2013 or more likely a sub-set of them \u2013 might be analyzed by the aforementioned subject either through workshops and focus groups or through Delphi studies (as applied in this paper). Managers and consultants of companies operating in Apparel and Footwear, Automotive, and Machinery and Equipment may leverage our specific results (Tables 5-8) as direct input. Similarly, some specific findings might be used as a guideline for policy interventions (e.g., highlighting aspects, practices or sectors requiring more specific legislation).",

The logical next step would be for the scenarios (Section 5.1) to be substantiated with empirical studies to understand their relevance and boundary conditions, as well as with theory-based research focused on explaining their mechanisms. Our effort might also be replicated in the service sector, to better understand emerging trajectories across current industry boundaries. The most relevant research opportunities refer to how VC \u201ccontrol points\u201d (Section 5) will evolve in the light of emerging cross-industry ecosystems. The issue of data pinpoints this debate, managerial research is essential to understand barriers, benefits and drawbacks of data sharing with business partners and emerging data governance modes. Policy research should work to suggest a portfolio of long-term action points addressing the potential dark sides of data-sharing in manufacturing. Other research topics are more specific, and refer to the implementation of small-scale production modes, the interplay between Industry 4.0 and circular economy practices, the technological determinants of reshoring, and IoT standardization effects on competition.",

At present, targeted responses must ensure that economic systems and individual organizations survive the shock in the short-term. In the long run, structural measures will be required to inject new impetus into the economy in the face of gloomy prospects of recession and unemployment. Among these structural measures, we expect investments in innovation \u2013 more likely backed by public incentives \u2013 to turn again the spotlight on the Industry 4.0 trajectory. Making the right decisions requires, however, that the options and their implications are well understood; it can only be hoped that \u2013 once the sanitary emergency is over \u2013 the preparations of our business leaders and policymakers will not be found wanting. In many respects the current understanding of the nature of Industry 4.0 is still blurred: different scenarios seem equally possible today depending on some crucial issues in relation to data, technologies, and demand characteristics. The effects of how these issues are approached will be profound not only for the future of individual companies but also for the competitiveness of manufacturing economies across the globe.",
