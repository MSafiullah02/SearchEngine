Due to increased knowledge about the prevalence and the impact of psychiatric co-morbidity in various populations (Table 1\n), these specialties have expanded their focus of practice into the outpatient setting, creating opportunities for trainees to provide psychiatric care to very specific populations, often longitudinally over an extended period.",

The 1996 ACLP resident guidelines observed the growth of CLP in primary care settings and the importance of continuity of care between inpatient and outpatient settings. These guidelines recommended that psychiatry residents be exposed to an ambulatory primary clinic, an outpatient specialty clinic, or an outpatient CLP clinic (3). Updated ACLP (at that time Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine [APM]) guidelines for training psychiatry residents in CLP in 2014 expanded upon the recommendation for an ambulatory experience, noting the valuable exposure to diverse patient populations and models of care, and the opportunity to design an outpatient integrated care experience to complement the inpatient CLP experience (4). The authors proposed including ambulatory CLP rotations within the 12-month outpatient residency requirement and allowed for the possibility that the outpatient rotation could serve as the primary exposure to CLP. Core competencies elucidated by the authors referenced an outpatient CLP experience as well.",

The inclusion criteria were (1) outpatient clinical settings with psychiatric consultation, collaborative care, integrated care, or co-localized care, (2) postgraduate trainees in psychiatry, primary care, family medicine or CL fellowship, and (3) assessment of the impact of these training environments. Each database search combined three sets of terms: 1. (psychiat* AND (consult* OR liaison); 2. (residen* OR traine* OR fellow*); 3. (outpatient OR ambulatory OR clinic). Limiting searches to title/abstract, English, and human subjects, the PubMed search resulted in n = 79 and the OVID search n = 323. Eligible articles were identified by careful review of titles and available abstracts. Duplicate articles were removed and studies that met inclusion criteria were evaluated and synthesized. Additional eligible publications were identified by reviewing the references of included studies. The search was narrowed down to 17 articles (see Table 3\n).",

The outcomes in all of these interventions were variable and of low to moderate quality, and the main conclusions that could be drawn from the outcomes were successful buy-in to the integrated care model and positive learner experience in providing integrated care (15). A summary of five psychiatry training programs that provided integrated care training for residents found that the success of such programs depended on the presence of a supervising psychiatrist with experience in integrated care, funding for faculty time, time within the residency program, office space within the clinical site, and a clinic \u201cchampion\u201d that supports integrated care (17). Overall, residents responded positively to the various integrated care experiences and viewed them as effective and relevant in preparing them for their future careers (16) and enhancing their learning on how to assess and manage complex medical-psychiatric patients (18, 22). Additional benefits of co-located and collaborative care models include increased primary care physician comfort with medication management, increased capacity to care for patients presenting with psychiatric problems and improved interprofessional communication and education (2, 17, 18, 22, 25).",

In addition, patients routinely seen by CLP consultants in the hospital may present with different clinical challenges outside the hospital; the patient seen on the inpatient neurology service for lupus encephalitis may have presented earlier in the rheumatology clinic with depression. The outpatient CLP setting can provide exposure to unique clinical scenarios, such as screening for depression in healthy primary care patients, assessments for risk stratification prior to surgery, untreated psychosis refusing mental health care and not meeting criteria for commitment, and somatization disorders or functional disorders that do not require hospitalization. The outpatient experience may provide exposure to psychiatric diagnoses more commonly seen in the outpatient setting, including mood, anxiety, adjustment disorders, and somatic symptom and related disorders (2). An outpatient CLP rotation may also allow the psychiatrist to assist patients with chronic mental disorders as they cope with the demands of medical care for serious medical conditions (e.g. patients with schizophrenia undergoing chemotherapy or organ transplantation), a task that is difficult to accomplish from a separate mental health clinic. Psychiatric evaluations focused on risk stratification prior to surgeries (e.g. weight loss surgery) are often performed exclusively in the outpatient setting because they benefit from specialized knowledge of the course of these complex medical processes.",

The level of supervision may be also dictated administratively by the hospital (e.g. ability to bill for services). Whenever possible, trainee independence should be encouraged, but immediate supervision should be available. We agree with prior recommendations (4) that the faculty supervisor should be a physician who has completed a CLP fellowship, a combined residency in internal medicine-psychiatry or family medicine-psychiatry, or be board certified in CLP, though extensive clinical experience in CLP may also be acceptable.
