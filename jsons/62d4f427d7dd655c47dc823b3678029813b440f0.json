Then, results from other techniques (Agar+IgG, IEM-Ft) were compared with DEM and the different ratios obtained were averaged for each technique and are represented in Table 1 . The compared relative sensitivity of the different techniques indicated that IEM techniques have permitted the detection of a greater number of rotaviruses per grid square. The Agar+ IgG and IEM-Ft techniques revealed nearly 25 and 103 times, respectively, more virus particles per square grid than DEM.

However, rotavirus detection and identification may prove more difficult when dealing in some samples with isolated altered particle (Fig. IB, C) . Aggregated rotaviruses are, however, more easily detected on the grid. Figure ID shows an immune complex of rotaviruses seen after using the Agar+IgG method. Altered particles or fragments of virions were also frequently seen within such aggregates as shown in Fig.  I E. The indirect IEM approach also permitted an easy detection of rotaviruses because of the ferritin molecules surrounding the immune complexes (Fig. IF) which greatly increased the electron density of the aggregates thus permitting their detection at very low magnification. Single shelled human rotaviruses exposing their group antigens were aggregated, as expected, by the antibovine rotavirus serum but some enveloped particles were also associated with the immune complexes, presumably because of a partial disruption of their outer membrane. Since human rotaviruses are not yet amenable to tissue culture isolation, DEM has become a widely used approach for diagnostic purposes. Other techniques such as counter-immunoelectro-osmophoresis (16), radioimmunoassay (11) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (21) have also been used in the detection of rotaviruses. However, the possibility of visualizing other viruses by electron microscopy greatly favors this approach in the cases of gastroenteritis (19). Our study indicates that IEM techniques revealed per surface area much more rotaviruses than DEM. Other workers have also previously reported on the greater sensitivity of IEM techniques over DEM (2, 7, 8, 13, 17) . With plant viruses, Milne and Luisoni (17) and Derrick (7) reported increases of 10 to 50 times more particles on grid per surface area after using IEM techniques. Similarly, the Agar+IgG method has permitted us to detect 25 times more rotaviruses than DEM. Also, the indirect approach using ferritin-labeled antibodies proved approximately one-hundred times more sensitive than DEM. A few studies have previously dealt with diagnostic indirect IEM techniques (9, 20) . In one of the latter studies, Edwards et al (9) have found that indirect IEM after using serial dilutions was more sensitive than direct IEM. Although the evaluations of sensitivity of the techniques were different, our study also agreed with this finding, the IEM-Ft approach being more sensitive than the Agar-l-IgG method by a factor of about four.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1685, "end": 1688, "text": "(2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1689, "end": 1691, "text": "7,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1692, "end": 1694, "text": "8,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1695, "end": 1698, "text": "13,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1699, "end": 1702, "text": "17)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1725, "end": 1747, "text": "Milne and Luisoni (17)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2165, "end": 2168, "text": "(9,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2169, "end": 2172, "text": "20)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2205, "end": 2222, "text": "Edwards et al (9)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 50, "end": 56, "text": "Fig. l", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 193, "end": 205, "text": "(Fig. IB, C)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 279, "end": 288, "text": "Figure ID", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 469, "end": 479, "text": "Fig.  I E.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 621, "end": 630, "text": "(Fig. IF)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "RESULTS"}, {"text": "The simplicity, rapidity and sensitivity associated with the Agar+IgG method make it a recommendable technique that can be routinely used for the detection of rotaviruses. Aggregation of rotaviruses in which this technique excelled has facilitated rotavirus detection. Furthermore, other viruses as well can be detected using this approach because the agar contains antibodies against a variety of viruses (4). However, when ambiguous results are expected because of poorly preserved samples and/or very low virus concentration eliminating virus aggregation by the Agar+IgG method, the indirect IEM-Ft technique may prove very useful. The higher sensitivity of the latter approach together with the ferritin molecules serving as a reliable marker are likely to facilitate rotavirus detection and identification. Also, this approach can be adapted to other viruses (5). The latter technique may also represent an alternative procedure to the use of intact viral particles as IEM markers for the identification of structures or components with no recognizable morphology, but antigenically related to known viruses as recently reported by Almeida et al (1).
