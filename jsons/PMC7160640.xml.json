COVID-19 patients were firstly admitted in those Hospitals where ICU units and/or infectious disease wards were present. However, due to the outbreak and the overwhelming amount of COVID-19 patients needing hospitalization during the following weeks, it was not possible also in our region to preserve one or more hospitals from the disease (Figure 1\n), and all 13 hospitals are now COVID-19 as first days of April passed (Italy lockdown started March, 9th with none COVID-19 patients in our hospital). Our Hospital in Florence (San Giovanni di Dio Hospital) has more than 80 COVID-19 patients in different settings (ICU, medical and surgical ward) at the time of writing, almost 1/3 of the total hospital capacity (80/260 beds). Since the beginning of the epidemic the scenario has been completely different each new week, and it was not possible to plan elective activity even day by day.",

Areas previously dedicated to different activities were converted to COVID-19 wards and adjunctive ICUs, and medical staff from other specialties was converted to COVID staff to ensure 24/7 patients assistance. The elective surgical and office activity was dramatically reduced in all of the centers and reserved to priority cases. In our hospital only, 4 out of 11 operating rooms are now usable: 1 for urgency/emergency, 1 for only COVID patients, 1 hybrid room, 1 for elective cases. These reduced number of ORs should accommodate 5 different specialties at the same time: urology, general surgery, orthopedy, gynecology, and finally vascular surgery. Regarding Vascular Surgery reorganization, we decided to cut all varicose vein surgery, and all office activities (apart urgencies). Aneurysm, symptomatic carotid, CLI, hemodialysis AV access surgeries were centralized in our hospital, collecting those cases from peripheral hospitals which were overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients. Endovascular treatment of CLI was preferred over bypass surgery in order to eliminate the presence of the anesthetist in the OR due to their shortage in number (many patients to be followed-up in ICUs and some anesthetists are at the time of writing unfortunately infected). Asymptomatic carotid lesions evaluated at high risk of stroke were started to be operated by our vascular staff in a private hospital which began to cooperate to the National Health System to help in this emergency situation. The drop of elective vascular surgical repair was around 34% if we compare March 2019 to March 2020. On the same way, the number of office visits dropped off around 80%.",

A corner of the whole operating block, well separate from the remaining ORs, was rapidly converted into one operating room and six ICU beds dedicated to COVID patients (Figure 2\n). The COVID-19 surgical path now includes an emergency room for suspected COVID-19 patients directly connected to an elevator for the transfer of COVID patients in the COVID operating block. Surgical operators access a dressing room first, where they dress up with the obligatory personal protective equipment (PPE), including: N95 mask, goggles, face shield, splash-resistant gown, boot covers and two pairs of surgical gloves. Then, the operators transfer to the COVID-19 area and into the operating room. The application of an alcoholic solution on the second pair of gloves, followed by a sterile gown and an extra pair of sterile surgical gloves complete the surgical dressing. After the intervention, the surgical operators transfer to the undressing room located besides the OR and execute the undressing procedure supervised by a trained operator. All the surfaces of the operating room are decontaminated after the intervention.",

A clear line on the floor should be drawn to separate the clean from the contaminated field (Figure 3\n). We would like to report as example two cases, a ruptured AAA and a ruptured TAAA, occurred in a peripheral COVID hospital which was completely overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients with no bed left in ICU. The AAA patient was hemodynamically unstable so it was treated in the peripheral hospital and then transferred to the Hub ICU and then successfully discharged to a standard surgical ward. The hemodynamically stable covered rupture of a type II TAAA was transferred to the Hub hospital and treated by endovascular means as a COVID patient while wainting for the results of the COVID-19 test. The patient was kept isolated in the OR until the negative response of testing and was then transferred to the surgical ward.",

During the last decade, one of the main goals of the USL was to implement an organization chart encouraging the share of health-care professionals between all the facilities of the territorial network. Well established Telemedicine and surgical centralization protocols were already implemented before the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, allowing a fast response of the USL to the massive modification of the infrastructural needs required to face the disease. The rapid communication between the accepting hospital and the Hub center has to be as fast as possible, with rapid sharing of the clinical status and of the vascular imaging of the patient (when available) to reduce the time for decision making and to plan the most efficacious treatment option for the patient.",

Elective surgery should favor AAAs or TAAAs larger than 7 cm, symptomatic or vulnerable carotid lesions, AV fistulas and CLI.
