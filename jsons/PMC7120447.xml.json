All ventilation ducts must be completely sealed without any air leaks (e.g., all-welded steel pipe) and with a separate (over roof) air input and outlet for each isolation unit. Disinfection systems for air extraction/exhaust should be placed as close as possible to each isolation unit so that contaminated air does not go far in the piping on the way out. Exhaust air must be sterile after the disinfection process. Externally placed pipes for air inlet and outlets from isolates must be protected from strong winds that can create unfavourable pressure conditions. The air inlet/outlet to other parts of the hospital must also be protected against contamination from the isolates. Therefore, separate isolate buildings are the best solutions.Air change. Minimum of six changes of fresh air per hour in the patient room. This involves the replacement of all air in approximately 70 min. Avoid short circuit of the air currents.Clean inlet air\u2014HEPA-filtered and backlash secured\u2014is introduced from the ceiling or top of the wall of the patient room in such a way that the least possible turbulence occurs during normal use.Exhaust air is contaminated and should be disinfected and HEPA-filtered closest possible to the isolation unit. All air from the isolation unit goes out via the separate exhaust system; from the patient\u2019s room through grates on lower end of the door to the disinfection room. The exhaust air is disinfected close to\u2014or in the isolate to avoid contaminated air in the piping. Exhaust air is never drawn directly out from the patient room or from the sluice because of risk of unfavourable air currents and increased infection burden on personnel. Exhaust air must be sterile after treatment and sent out via pipe over roof.Gassing of ventilation pipes with disinfecting gases (formaldehyde, chlorine dioxide, hydrogen peroxide, etc.) must be implemented in a regular manner. Assuming the ventilation duct is completely closed and separately for each unit, various types of gas could be used. If leakages are suspected, it may be difficult to use formaldehyde gas (allergy) and chlorine dioxide gas if other part of the building is to be used. The type of gas used must be chosen according to documented effect of the infectious agent, for instance, Ebola infection. Chlorine gas and hydrogen peroxide dry gas are among the safest gases used today. There is currently no gas which disinfects tubercle bacilli.Continuous electricity supply must be ensured in the isolation unit and the ventilation and negative pressure system.\n",
