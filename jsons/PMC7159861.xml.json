Most patients were admitted because of fever, cough, dyspnoea, and chest CT findings consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests. Two patients with pre-existing digestive diseases were excluded from our analysis. The analysis was approved by the institutional review boards of Sun Yat-sen University and the participating hospitals. Full details of the methods used are in the appendix (p 1).",

Similarly, a greater proportion of patients admitted to hospital had diarrhoea as the outbreak progressed. This difference could be due to a heightened awareness of the gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19 among clinicians. Additionally, the passing of time could have allowed the virus to accumulate mutations that might have affected its tropism for the intestines. The difference could also reflect geographic differences between populations studied (ie, early studies from Wuhan vs our patients from four other cities). The increasing number of patients with COVID-19 who have gastrointestinal symptoms warrants further study.",
