Knowing the evolutionary history of a species is vital for understanding their biology.

When the input consists of only two or three trees, it can be solved relatively efficiently\u2014EPT time [8, 17]\u2014even though the problem is already NP-hard in that case. For an input consisting of three trees or more, there is still an FPT algorithm [9], but it is not practical.

The problem we solve is analogous to Hybridization, but with networks as the input, Network Hybridization: Given a set of networks with taxa X, find a network N with minimal reticulation number, that displays all input networks. Since this is a generalization of the Hybridization problem, the problem remains NP-hard in general, even for inputs of two networks. We show that for the restricted problem on tree-child (topologically restricted class of networks; defined formally in Sect. 2) inputs and output, we can use tree-child sequences to obtain an FPT algorithm. This FPT algorithm is an extension of the one introduced in [7] in which they considered tree inputs; the tree-child sequence approach was first introduced in [14]. We also comment briefly on how some measure of an optimal solution to the Network Hybridization problem can be characterized by solving this restricted problem.",

This section also relates this problem to the more general Network Hybridization. In Sect. 4.1, we lay the theoretical foundation to extend the algorithm in [7] that takes inputs of trees to also work for inputs of networks. As a last theoretical section in the paper, we present an FPT algorithm that solves Tree-Child Network Hybridization (Sect. 4.2). We conclude the paper with a discussion, including some open questions (Sect. 5).",
