            "text": "On Aug 8, 2014, the Director-General of WHO declared that the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in parts of west Africa represented a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) under the 2005 International Health Regulations.1 Also in August, 2014, WHO called for fast-track development of Ebola vaccines as part of the Ebola Response Roadmap2 and in October, 2014, WHO stressed that development of one or more Ebola vaccines was an urgent international public health priority.3, 4 In support of accelerated development of Ebola vaccines from preclinical research to clinical trials, in November, 2014, the Wellcome Trust and the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota established the Wellcome Trust-CIDRAP Ebola Vaccine Team B initiative (hereafter referred to as the Ebola Vaccine Team B). This ongoing initiative includes experts with global experience in various phases of bringing new vaccines to market, such as funding, research and development, manufacturing, determination of safety and efficacy, regulatory approval, and vaccination delivery. It also includes experts in community engagement strategies and ethical issues germane to vaccination policies, including eight African scientists with direct experience in developing and implementing vaccination policies in Africa. Ebola Vaccine Team B members have worked on a range of vaccination programmes, such as polio eradication (both in Africa and globally), development of meningococcal A disease vaccination campaigns in Africa, and malaria and HIV/AIDS vaccine research. The Ebola Vaccine Team B initiative has involved up to 28 members and four staff; all members (other than the two chairs [Osterholm and Farrar] and staff) volunteered their time and received no compensation for their efforts.",

To achieve these objectives, during the period from late November, 2014, to early February, 2015, working subgroups of Ebola Vaccine Team B experts met regularly via international conference calls to discuss and comment on various issues related to the development and delivery of Ebola vaccines. These discussions led to the release in February, 2015, of a set of recommendations and a draft target product profile (TPP) for Ebola vaccines.5 At the time of writing, the Ebola Vaccine Team B is still engaged in constructive assessment and critique of the ongoing development and evaluation of Ebola vaccines. Here we outline key initial recommendations from the Ebola Vaccine Team B, provide an overview of the current Ebola vaccine landscape, discuss recommendations for future consideration, and present the TPP that was developed as part of the initial report. We also provide perspective on how this experience can inform future situations where urgent development of vaccines is needed, and we comment on the role that an independent, expert group such as Team B can have in support of national and international public health authorities toward addressing a public health crisis.",

            "text": "As of August, 2015, only preliminary results of the Guinea study, which is an open-label, cluster-randomised, ring vaccination clinical trial, had been published.41 In this study, participants were randomly assigned to immediate or delayed receipt of one dose of 2 \u00d7 107 plaque-forming units (pfu) of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine. On days 3 and 14 post-vaccination, study investigators obtained information about adverse events from participants or their next of kin. After 10 days post-randomisation, no cases of EVD occurred in those who received vaccine as part of the group randomly assigned to receive immediate vaccination compared with 16 confirmed cases among all eligible persons in the delayed vaccination group. The authors stated this analysis yielded a vaccine efficacy of 100% (95% CI 74\u00b77\u2013100\u00b70; p=0\u00b70036), based on assessment of 90 case clusters. This value also can be defined as a measure of total vaccine effectiveness,48 because it is affected by conditions within the two populations, not only by the individuals in those populations. At the cluster level with the inclusion of all eligible participants, the authors estimated the vaccine effectiveness as 75\u00b71% (95% CI \u22127\u00b71 to 94\u00b72; p=0\u00b71791) because six cases of EVD happened in participants who were assigned to the immediate vaccination group but did not receive vaccine (apparently because they did not consent to be vaccinated or consent was not obtained). This value can also be considered a measure of overall effectiveness,48 since the comparison involved all participants (vaccinated and not vaccinated) in the two randomised groups. 43 serious adverse events were reported; one serious adverse event was judged to be causally related to vaccination (a febrile episode in a vaccinated participant, which resolved without sequelae); assessment of serious adverse events is ongoing. Although these results are highly encouraging, because of clustering within the rings, participants are not statistically independent, which could affect the precision in this type of study design.49, 50 Although the authors suggested they accounted for this issue, further data are needed to validate the findings. The ring vaccination approach used in this trial is continuing in Guinea (but without randomisation to delayed vaccination) and, in late August, 2015, was expanded into Sierra Leone.51, 52\n",

The first trial, which involved 20 participants in the USA, identified no safety concerns, although transient fever developed within 1 day after vaccination in two participants who had received a 2 \u00d7 1011 particle-unit dose.43 The second trial involved 60 volunteers in Oxford, UK, who received a single dose of cAd3-EBOV vaccine at one of three dose levels (1 \u00d7 1010 viral particles, 2\u00b75 \u00d7 1010 viral particles, and 5 \u00d7 1010 viral particles); 20 participants were included in each group.44 No safety concerns were identified and the cAd3-EBOV vaccine was immunogenic at the doses tested. A final report involved a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 trial using two different doses of an adenovirus type-5 vector-based Ebola vaccine (one high dose and one low dose).46 120 participants were enrolled, with 40 in each arm of the study. The authors determined the high-dose vaccine was immunogenic and no serious adverse events were noted, although 82 participants (68%) reported at least one adverse reaction within 7 days of vaccination (19 in the placebo group, 27 in the low-dose group, n=36 in the high-dose group [p=0\u00b70002]).",

            "text": "The Ebola Vaccine Team B has provided an opportunity to discuss and address several crucial issues related to Ebola vaccine development and dissemination. Several key lessons, however, are generalisable to the broader issue of global infectious disease prevention and control. First, the current market-driven approach for vaccine development is not adequate to protect impoverished populations from emerging infectious diseases of epidemic or pandemic potential. Creative funding strategies are needed that ensure vaccines move efficiently from discovery and research through clinical trials and licensure to manufacturing and delivery, even when ongoing profitability for vaccine manufacturers is not assured. Second, the west Africa Ebola epidemic illustrates the need for enhanced international coordination and transparency, particularly regarding approval processes for doing clinical trials in developing countries and addressing international regulatory issues for licensure of new vaccines. As part of this process, better preparedness plans need to be in place to address community engagement needs in advance of a crisis situation. Finally, the west Africa Ebola epidemic highlights the need to further strengthen disease surveillance systems in the region as well as in other geographical areas within the continent and globally.",

            "text": "At the onset of the Ebola epidemic in west Africa, several Ebola vaccines were in preclinical development, owing to substantial investments by various government agencies, the pharmaceutical industry, and private foundations. Prior work on product development platforms allowed relatively rapid progression to clinical trials for several vaccine candidates, but delivery of efficacious licensed products to affected areas has yet to happen. More rapid efficacy assessment of these vaccines would have been possible if they had been assessed for initial safety and immunogenicity in phase 1\u20132 studies before the onset of the epidemic, and if there had been greater consensus before the epidemic on the feasibility and appropriateness of study designs to assess efficacy. An improved process is needed to identify infectious diseases of epidemic or pandemic potential and to ensure that more robust research is initiated and supported to develop vaccines and other medical countermeasures for such pathogens. The most obvious example is vaccines for emergent novel influenza viruses with pandemic potential. Other pathogens of importance include paramyxoviruses, such as Nipah virus and Hendra virus; emergent coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus; other haemorrhagic fever viruses such as Marburg virus, Rift Valley fever virus, and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus; emergent enteroviruses, such as EV71, EV68 (or D68), and Coxsackie A16 (or CA16); hepatitis E virus; and chikungunya virus. In addition to research and development, more efforts are needed to ensure that such vaccines are supported through clinical trials, manufacturing, and delivery to potential at-risk populations.",

            "text": "A Team B approach can augment traditional public health efforts in several ways. First, a Team B can include non-governmental international experts with a wide range of past experience from the private and public sectors and from academia. In the case of this Team B, the broad range of expertise allowed the group to cover all areas of Ebola vaccine development and deployment. In particular, the participation of African scientists allowed the group to delve into issues specific to west Africa and provided a so-called ground zero perspective, which was crucial for the success and credibility of the initiative. Team B staff also contacted additional experts who provided further valuable insights. Government processes, by contrast, might be more limited in engaging partners from the private sector because of the regulatory role that some governmental agencies have, which can generate concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Second, a Team B can be organised quickly and can retain its autonomy. This allows a Team B to generate outputs rapidly because the process does not depend on government or private-sector review or approval and is not hamstrung by issues such as concerns about antitrust (which, for example, could arise with any consortium of pharmaceutical companies). In this situation, the Ebola Vaccine Team B was able to rapidly generate a TPP and share it with the WHO for its future use. Finally, a Team B can be more flexible and nimble than most government bodies and can respond to a changing landscape more quickly by adjusting programmatic priorities.",

            "text": "Several challenges also exist with developing and sustaining a Team B. First, a need exists for adequate staffing of the Team B to conduct research and draft documents. Second, a Team B must rely on volunteer engagement of relevant experts. Even in situations where financial support can be provided, the support will not be commensurate with the hours of service needed. Third, a Team B must balance the desire to be of service without encroaching on the work of government entities and global organisations, and without being overly critical of efforts underway. This entails walking a fine line and engaging public-sector partners as appropriate. Finally, Team B members might not always have an insider's perspective on information because of a lack of direct involvement with government entities or companies, which can limit the ability to obtain a full and accurate situational assessment.",
