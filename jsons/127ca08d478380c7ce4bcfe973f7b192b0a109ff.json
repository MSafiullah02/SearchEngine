Throat swabs from 122 intensive care-patients >18 years with acute respiratory symptoms were collected upon admission and analysed with multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction, for 12 community respiratory viruses. Blood and respiratory tract specimens were analysed for bacteria and fungi upon clinicians' request. Clinical and paraclinical data were collected. Viruses were detected in 19 (16%) of the 122 study patients. Five virus-positive patients (26%) had possible clinically relevant bacteria or fungi co-detected. Patients with exacerbation in COPD were associated with a viral infection (p = 0.02). Other comorbidities, clinical and paraclinical parameters, and death were independent of a viral infection or co-detection of bacteria/fungi. In conclusion, respiratory viruses were frequently detected in the patients. The investigated clinical and paraclinical parameters were not different in viral infections compared to other agents, thus respiratory viruses likely have similar impact on the clinical course as other agents. In 25% of the virus-positive patients, polymicrobial aetiology was identified. Comprehensive and sensitive diagnostic methods should be emphasized to enhance respiratory diagnostics.",

            "text": "Today, a large number of pathogens, mainly viruses, can be identified with rapid, highly sensitive and specific molecular methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Clinically, it is difficult to determine the microbiological aetiology of respiratory tract infections. The microbiological findings are often influenced by antibiotic treatment before admission to intensive care units (ICU), which makes the microbiological test results difficult to interpret, and may disguise significant pathogens. Furthermore, the differentiation between pathogens causing invasive infection and colonization is often impossible. This has implications for the patients, as infections with different pathogens have different prognosis and response to treatment. Viral diagnostics are often used as second-line diagnostics and saved for cases where no significant bacterial pathogen has been revealed during the initial analyses, or for cases with deterioration in clinical symptoms despite treatment of revealed bacteria. This approach can lead to a delay in potentially beneficially antiviral treatment. The aetiology of severe acute respiratory disease remains undetermined in more than 50% of the patients (10) (11) (12) . Virological molecular methods have improved markedly during the recent years by the introduction of molecular techniques (2, 13, 14) . However, there are still few studies using these methods for detection of a large number of viruses in ICU-patients (10) (11) (12) .",

A patient was included if any sign of respiratory distress or failure was apparent, including exacerbation in COPD or asthma, and pneumonia.

The presence of bacteria or fungi in samples from the airways in ICUsettings will only rarely be considered diagnostic for a given infection, as most of the isolations could represent both an infection and a colonizing organism. Even in blood cultures, the microorganism detected may not necessarily represent an infection. The results in our study illustrate both issues, as only 36% of the respiratory isolates and 23% of isolates detected in blood cultures from virus-negative patients were considered to be clinically relevant for the respiratory disease.",

The detection rate of 16% viruses in our study population confirms together with other studies that respiratory viruses are common in ICU-patients, and confirms the validity of the PCR method used. Influenza A was the virus most frequently detected, followed by RSV, which supports previous results (12, 21, 22) . The detection of respiratory viruses such as influenza, parainfluenza viruses and coronaviruses in the presence of acute respiratory symptoms have previously been shown to cause severe pneumonia, requiring intensive care treatment and mechanical ventilation (5, 8, 22, 23) . The other respiratory viruses detected in our study, such as rhinoviruses, RSV and hMPV, have also been shown by several studies to cause significant symptoms, morbidity and potential need of intensive care treatment (6, 24) . Most of the respiratory viruses detected in the multiplex PCR presented show seasonal variations of frequency (25) (26) (27) . Although some weeks were missing at the beginning of the influenza season in our study, the main seasons for the different viruses were covered. Any seasonal variations of the viruses during the study period should be accommodated. The timing of the sample collection could have interfered in the number of positive samples if performed late in the clinical course of the infection, but 75% of the samples were taken within 4 days of admission with acute respiratory disease.",

Several studies throughout the last century have demonstrated the association between respiratory viruses and bacterial infections (3, (28) (29) (30) . The most frequent combination of virus and bacteria in our study was influenza A and S. aureus, which is a welldescribed relationship. Most patients were admitted either directly at the ICU or less than 3 days after hospital admission, which makes nosocomial infection or selection of opportunistic agents less likely. Influenza-positive patients frequently had a coincident finding in respiratory cultures, of which two thirds of the microorganisms were considered clinically significant and likely to represent a severe superinfection. A recent study reported similar results; approximately half of influenzapatients presenting with a coinfection (12) . These findings demonstrate that neither bacteriological nor virological analyses should stand alone. In this study, patients with a virus plus a microbiological agent tended to be admitted and ventilated for a similar period as the virus-negative, bacteria/fungi-positive patients. This could indicate a more severe morbidity caused by the combination of agents. We found no association between the number of deaths and different combinations of microbiological agents, but a large frequency of pneumonia was noted even among virus-only infected patients. The findings are in line with some recent studies (12, 31, 32) , and partly supported by a study on nearly 210.000 ICUpatients which found a strong association between being infected with viruses and bacteria during the same hospitalization and developing septic shock or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (8) . As opposed to our results, this study also demonstrated a strong association with mortality in these patients (8) .",

This supports the fact that interpreting current practice microbiological analyses is difficult in ICUpatients. This was also recently pointed out in a study investigating biomarkers in bronchoalveolar lavages for diagnosing respiratory viral infections (33) . The clinical picture of respiratory tract infections in ICU is further complicated by the fact that severe infections with focus outside of the respiratory system may also result in pulmonary congestion and infiltrates due to ARDS. These changes may resemble pneumonia, but the pathogen may not be found in either the respiratory secretions or in the blood.

This may further cloud interpretation of bacterial analyses, and contribute to the lack of diagnoses in some patients. A more comprehensive diagnostic programme than today's practice, including a wider use of molecular methods in bacteriology, could possibly result in more accurate diagnoses and a reduction in the use of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. In greater perspectives, this could contribute to relieving the increasing issues with antibiotic resistance.
