That is how long the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic gave us to adapt individually, socially and professionally to a context never before experienced or even imagined, a scenario of high stress that has already changed our way of life and that of future generations. The uniqueness of the COVID-19 pandemic is that we must adapt to those changes quickly, in a scenario of great uncertainty, and almost with no time to reflect or assimilate it.",

This knowledge is of maximum interest to be able to design strategies and measures preserving the maximum integrity of mental health in countries where the pandemic is fully developed or still to develop.",

The term stress was first used to describe situations in which aggressive external factors trigger a physiological response and behavior to prepare the individual to cope with these stimuli2. Valdes-Florido et al.3 describe a series of four clinical cases of brief reactive psychosis coinciding with the stressful situation we have been experiencing for the last four weeks, and in which an important emotional instability component and impulsive/suicidal behavior are evident.",

If they are broken, our brain can be overcome by the number of decisions and emotions that have to be faced in a menacing and negative affective reality. On a personal level, we need to create new heuristic models to achieve that new cerebral homeostasis.",

The challenges for coping are many and diverse, and we know the stress of establishing new habits. What we do not know, although it is often conjectured, are the mid-to-long term consequences of this adaptive effort.",
