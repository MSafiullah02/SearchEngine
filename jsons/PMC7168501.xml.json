The authorities soon became aware of the catastrophe that was to endanger Hong Kong, and on 28 March 2003, they announced the suspension of all teaching activities in primary and secondary schools, followed by the closure of the universities. This was the beginning of what seemed to be an entry into the unknown. The final MBBS examination was completed just before SARS took its hold. However, dates for other examinations could not be confirmed. Four plans \u2013 A, B, C and D \u2013 were put in place in case the situation dragged on indefinitely. \u2018Make good use of the time to do revision,\u2019 was the advice given to students. Fortunately, we didn't have to go beyond plan A.",

As gathering large numbers of students in a lecture hall was considered to be a high risk activity, PowerPoint files containing the lecturer's voice were made available on the faculty website. These proved successful as students did not have to rush to attend their 08.00 hours whole\u2010class sessions and they could re\u2010visit the lecture as many times as they wished. For students, falling asleep or daydreaming in class were no longer considered problems! A plan for holding PBL tutorials through chat rooms on the web did not need to be put into action as SARS declined. All of this, although helpful, was, of course, a far cry from face\u2010to\u2010face interaction between students and tutors.",

In practice, however, what it meant for medical students was that they should: \u2018Wash hands, wear gown, put on cap, mask and eye\u2010shield and look like an astronaut to control SARS\u2019. These \u2018astronauts\u2019 were an instant hit and were a major attraction around the hospital, particularly with the patients, who were more than happy to talk to such extremely well protected medicos.",

Due to a prior engagement in Europe, the external examiner could not attend the examinations during the week of the reassigned examination. There was no difficulty in sending him random samples of written papers and MCQ/EMQs and scores of marks for evaluation. However, regulations require that an external examiner must participate in distinction vivas. A solution was worked out whereby the vivas were conducted by telephone conference. A connection was made to a hotel room in France where external examiner Professor Ronald Harden, from Dundee, was staying at the time. Because there were 8 candidates, and the possibility of telephone line interruption could not be ruled out, the first part of the viva was conducted by Prof Harden with candidates responding to his questions in front of 3 internal examiners. All went well for this part. However, a short time into the second part, while Prof Harden was listening to other examiners' questions and the candidates' answers, the line from France appeared to go completely silent. One of the internal examiners gently remarked, \u2018I think the line has gone. Perhaps Professor Harden got bored and hung up, or has gone somewhere else.\u2019 Ron Harden's response came back instantly, \u2018No, I am still here and can hear everything loud and clear.\u2019 (Moral: Take care; silent telephones also have ears!). This was one of the few lighter moments during the scourge of SARS.",
