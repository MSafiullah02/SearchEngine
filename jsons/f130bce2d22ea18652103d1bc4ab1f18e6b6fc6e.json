High mobility of residents across jurisdictions deepens the interdependence between agencies in vertical and horizontal relationships in such an outbreak response. Even though governmental officials may have an understanding about the nature of the disease, they may not know the accurate path of the disease transmission without relying on information from other public organizations, which may occasionally be in foreign jurisdictions. Thus, governmental agencies have an immediate need to develop communicative resilience to improve interorganizational risk communication and gain essential information about the impending public health or environmental hazards. This, in turn, would enable them to respond better to an outbreak in their regional or local areas.

Moreover, it proposes and tests two hypotheses about managerial strategies to improve resilience in interorganizational risk communication. The case used for this study is the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS) outbreak that occurred in South Korea in 2015. Many South Korean governmental agencies suffered from a lack of risk information regarding the nature of the infectious disease and contagion path when responding to the outbreak. The governmental agencies strived to obtain risk information from other agencies because of the transregional nature of the outbreak. However, they failed to get risk information shared by the national public health authority in the initial response period due to their incomplete provision of up-to-date information. We believe this study will enhance understanding about the manner in which governmental agencies build resilience in interorganizational risk communication during an outbreak response.

In addition, Bruneau et al. (2003) argued that there are four dimensions of resilience that are applicable to communities and organizations: robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness, and rapidity. Communities or organizations can respond better to an extreme event by improving their ability to withstand a stress without losing their primary functions, ensuring substitutable elements of operation, mobilizing resources to achieve desirable goals, and meeting needs in a timely manner. From a communication perspective, organizations can improve their ability to bounce back from an extreme event and adapt their actions to the devastated circumstances by establishing multiple channels of cooperation and ensuring an overlap in information sources.

The third graph shows the proportion of ties between two actors connected jointly to one or more actors, and the fourth graph indicates the proportion of dyads that are connected by a certain length. The graphs show that estimated network statistics of degree and edge-wise shared partners are similar to the most simulated network statistics, while the estimated network statistics of the minimum geodesic distance are less similar to the simulated network statistics.

In the summer of 2015, South Korea suffered from an outbreak of MERS, which is caused by a virus called MERS Coronavirus (CDC, 2015). The virus is transmitted among people through close contact, and it affects respiratory systems that include lungs and breathing tubes. The common symptoms of MERS patients include severe shortness of breath, fever, and cough. Thirty or forty per cent of the patients tend to die. After the disease was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, other cases were identified in nearby countries. The first MERS patient in South Korea was identified on 20 May 2015, when a man aged 76 years visited four hospitals 7 days after his return from the Middle East (Ministry of Health & Welfare 2015a). His symptoms at the fourth hospital were reported to the South Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the national disease control agency. Upon investigation, the South Korean government isolated the patient's family members and 64 clinicians. The quarantine range was, however, not comprehensive enough to cover all those who had contact with the first patient (the National Assembly Special Committee 2015). This failure of the initial government response led to the transmission of the infectious disease from the untargeted people to other hospital patients and visitors. The continued transmission of the virus increased the number of MERS-infected patients over time. As of 5 July 2015, the outbreak resulted in the quarantine of around 17,000 people (usually 14 days at home), and 186 cases were confirmed as MERS infection. The MERS outbreak affected three metropolitan regions and five provinces. On 27 July 2015, the national government decided regional, and local governments, as well as police and fire agencies. These organizations suffered problems in risk communication. The principal national agency was reluctant to disclose the name of the hospitals visited by the first MERS patient, and only released the information 17 days after the patient was identified (Ministry of Health & Welfare 2015c). After more people had tested positive for the virus, the Ministry of Health and Welfare then disclosed the name of the hospitals that had MERS patients. The government then designated MERS-free hospitals all over the country to respond to the safety concerns of the general public. Growing concern about the transmission of the infectious disease highlighted the formal and informal risk communication among the national and subnational governments.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "items, however, our final data set includes responses only from 130 organizations.

The investigator selected the interviewees by considering the roles of their agencies in the outbreak response as well as their availability for an interview. Eight interviewees were introduced by an acquaintance of public employees who were familiar with the investigator, while three interviewees were identified by the investigator. The investigator conducted the interviews in Korean, with each interview lasting between 30 and 60 min.As most of the structured interview questions primarily aimed to understand a broader context of the outbreak response, we focused on the following questions to help us elaborate the research question: (1) Which organizations are important sources of information related to the outbreak response? (2) Please rate how much did the organization trust the sources you mentioned; time, and budget did not allow the investigator to travel to interview public officials of governmental agencies that were geographically dispersed. Despite the small number of interviews, the results will help enhance the contextual understanding of how governmental agencies improve resilience in risk communication during a virus outbreak response. The interview results are presented in the discussion section with the quantitative findings.5.2 | MethodsExponential Random Graph Modeling (ERGM) method is the main analysis method employed to analyse the pattern of the interagency risk communication network. ERGM allows researchers to specify a model of network generation in a flexible manner and accommodate a wide range of theories(Desmarais & Cranmer, 2012). ERGM models recognize complex dependencies among network ties, which violate the assumption of standard regression models, in predicting the formation of these ties(Robins, Lewis, & Wang, 2012). The modelling procedure will help examine the effects of dependencies among network ties and of attributes on the formation of interagency communication ties. The ERGM analysis is then conducted with R package statnet, an ERGM modelling package(Handcock et al. 2016). Our model converged in three iterations, and the log-likelihood iteration improved through three iterations. We checked for the model's goodness of fit by simulating a large number of networks based on the estimated coefficients measures whether the two actors receive and send information to each other(Figure 1a).

The national ministry/agency officials showed dissatisfaction with their communication with the responsible ministry, and subnational governments especially criticized the national government's low levels of transparency about the path of the infectious disease transmission. Interviewees reported as follows:Interviewee B: My agency sought risk information from the public health ministry, but the responsible manager of the ministry did not pick up the phones during the two weeks after the first case had been confirmed.Interviewee C: My agency had difficulties in identifying the contagion path because the national public health authority was passive in sharing information about MERS patients and hospitals exposed to the virus infection. My agency missed an important opportunity to prevent the infectious disease transmission in my jurisdiction early because of the low levels of transparency.

Further, it advances the understanding of how governmental organizations communicate information when responding to a public health emergency. While literature stresses strategic management of interorganizational networks for emergency response (e.g.,Choi & Brower, 2006;Demiroz et al., 2013;Hu et al., 2014) and intergovernmental communication in response to a virus outbreak(Ansell et al., 2010), there is a lack of systematic understanding about what communication strategies emergency response organizations can take in response to a public health emergency. As illustrated in the results section, this study suggests that a systematic examination of the interactions between public organizations during the MERS response can contribute to the understanding of interorganizational communication in responding to the outbreak of an infectious disease, for example Zika and Ebola viruses that may have a broad impact on South Korea as well as other countries. Interorganizational or intergovernmental risk management is also critical for the United States in responding to such an outbreak. A virus outbreak is the problem not only of one jurisdiction or region but also of multiple jurisdictions and regions. The recent outbreaks of the Ebola and Zika viruses demonstrate the transboundary nature of infectious disease transmission. The man aged 45 years who arrived in Dallas from Liberia transmitted the Ebola virus to one of the nurses who directly cared for him. Even though Dallas was not the original location of the virus outbreak, the city was nonetheless affected by it (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016). As of 9 March 2016, 194 cases of Zika virus infection has been associated with international travel while 173 cases were locally acquired. If those people who had come into close contact with these cases travelled across the United States, the virus would spread out of the states, regions, and local jurisdictions (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016). The transboundary nature of infectious disease transmission highlights the importance of hierarchical communication among different levels of governments, horizontal communication and cooperation between same or different types of agencies, and information systems. 7.1 | Intergovernmental communication This research points to advantages when all levels of governments and sectors in the United States cooperate in sharing information regarding the transmission of an infectious disease. Specifically, communication between local health agencies, state governments and the US CDC can improve the identification of infectious disease contagion paths. In addition, in metropolitan areas where residents travel frequently across local jurisdictions, local governments must strive to communicate with each other regarding disease transmission to collectively improve the ability of the communities to adapt to a virus outbreak. National and subnational governments could improve potential outbreaks with the use of disease surveillance information systems. For instance, the U.S. CDC operates the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) that facilitates the exchange of public health information between public health agencies (CDC, 2015). The system provides information standards for states so that the subnational governments share information with the CDC and other health agencies. The more public health agencies rely on it, the better the system functions. The U.S. CDC may need to test whether the NNDSS is effective in sharing information among public health agencies and the national disease control agency regarding the contagion path of any infectious disease. This study has limitations in understanding interorganizational risk communication for a virus outbreak response and proposes areas for future research. First, the study does not provide an empirical understanding of the strategies' effectiveness. Although this study helps in understanding what communication strategies public organizations can take in responding to a virus outbreak, the findings do not indicate which strategy is more beneficial for improving outbreak response. Future studies may examine the effects of interagency communication strategies on the outcomes of the outbreak response, such as understanding the contagion path or interorganizational collaboration effectiveness. Such a study may help governmental agencies identify the most beneficial communication strategies to access and transmit crucial information. Future studies are recommended to test the applicability of this study's findings to public agencies in the United States.
