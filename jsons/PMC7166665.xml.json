With a novel coronavirus, the SARS\u2010associated coronavirus, as the etiologic agent [Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003], the disease spread rapidly across the world, infecting individuals in several countries with a fatality rate of \u223c10% [Gu and Korteweg, 2007]. In this study, a cDNA library was generated from the autopsy lung tissue of a SARS\u2010associated coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) infected patient by using random primers. cDNA cloning is a fundamental technology for researches in gene discovery and transcriptome analysis [Harbers, 2008]. However, standard cDNA missed many transcripts that lack poly(A) tails [Cheng et al., 2005; Kapranov et al., 2007]. Reverse transcription reactions through alternative random primers of six nucleotides would have more tendency to clone transcripts lacking poly(A) tails, such as ncRNAs and ploy(A)\u2013mRNAs, with more chances to find novel transcripts as compared to cDNA library generated by oligo (dT) primers. In addition, the data presented in this paper is also a human cDNA library generated from SARS\u2010CoV infected lung tissue, which might contribute to the human genomic analyses and the SARS pathological researches.",

The stand along program GOBU [Lin et al., 2006] and the WEGO [Ye et al., 2006] web service were exploited to categorize the GO IDs based on the GO terms and hierarchical structure [Ashburner et al., 2000]. These two programs led to the same GO result, that is, these two programs output the same relative GO ID counts of the assembled sequences falling to the main GO categories and to the second level GO categories. During the comparison of the annotation between the transcripts in the SARS\u2010CoV library and in the other six libraries, only those second level GO categories with significant relative count differences were considered and discussed where the relative counts of the SARS\u2010CoV library were the highest or the lowest among the seven libraries. The statistical significance of the relative count differences between the assembled sequences in the SARS\u2010CoV library and in the other six libraries was determined by using Wilcoxon Signed\u2010Rank Test with P\u2010value < 0.05.",

Genome sequencing revealed that 8% of the human genome consists of HERVs [Medstrand et al., 2002; Bannert and Kurth, 2004]. Different endogenous retroviruses also exhibit differential responsiveness to environmental signals and activation of the immune system [Taruscio and Mantovani, 2004]. It was reported that the expression of HERVs was affected by cytokines [Katsumata et al., 1999; Schneider et al., 2001] and steroids [Ono et al., 1987]. Recent report showed that HIV\u20101 infection leads to HERV expression and stimulation of a HERV\u2010specific CD8+ T cell response [Garrison et al., 2007]. The high level HERVs expression in this case might imply the steroid hormone therapy in the severe patient.",

Proteins in these categories were lipid\u2010binding proteins in the synaptic vesicle, such as synaptotagmin and synaptoporin, and the postsynaptic element, such as cholinergic receptor. Since a line of evidence showed that steroid hormone increased synapse density [Jelks et al., 2007] or up\u2010regulated the expression of synaptic proteins [Crispino et al., 1999; Rune et al., 2002; Kretz et al., 2004], the high level expression of synaptic proteins in this case should have resulted from the high dose corticosteroids therapy in the severe patient.",

These proteins were isoforms of myosims, Dynein heavy chains, and Kinesin\u2010like proteins. Since many studies have indicated that viruses exploit cytoskeletal dynamics and viral particles recruit molecular motors in order to hitchhike rides to different subcellular sites [Fackler and Krausslich, 2006; Greber and Way, 2006; Radtke et al., 2006], the high level expression of motor proteins in this case might suggest the active intracellular transportation of SARS\u2010CoV particles.",

Many sequences matching with proteins involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and endocytosis were found (Supplementary Table SII). The result was consistent with the result of a recent study that SARS\u2010CoV entered cells through direct fusion with the plasma membrane as well as a clathrin\u2010 and caveolae\u2010independent endocytic mechanism mediated by cholesterol\u2010 and sphingolipid lipid raft microdomains [Wang et al., 2008] and also consistent with the results of other studies that cytoskeleton reorganization and cellular signal transduction as well as endocytosis were inextricably linked [Balklava and Grant, 2005; Pelkmans, 2005; Pelkmans et al., 2005]. The result suggested the active processes of viral endocytosis and viral particle spread in the SARS\u2010CoV infected tissue.",
