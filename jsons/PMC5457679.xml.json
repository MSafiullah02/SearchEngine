As the absence of light excludes the development of photosynthetic organisms, the endogenous sources of organic matter are mainly of bacterial and animal origin (decomposing products and bat droppings). Exogenous organic matter can be brought inside the cave through water runoff.",

Polychromophilus parasites mainly infect bats of several genera, including Miniopterus, Rhinolophus, Myotis, Pipistrellus, Hipposideros, Antrozous and Glosophaga.17 Most of these bats are found in Afrotropical caves, especially the species Miniopterus minor minor Peters, Rhinolophus sylvestris group Aellen and Hipposideros caffer that are infected by Polychromophilus almost permanently.41 Recent investigations in Gabon caves revealed that the bat fly species P. fulvida and Nycteribia schmidlii scotti are heavily infected by Polychromophilus melanipherus. Moreover, the finding that both bat fly species parasitize Miniopterus inflatus Thomas, a natural host of this parasite,20, 42 suggests that these bat fly species might transmit this parasite. Infections by P. melanipherus have also been observed in Eucampsipoda africana, a Nycteribiidae species that infests cave-dwelling bats.20 To date, flies from the Streblidae family have never been incriminated in the transmission of haemosporidian parasites. Nevertheless, their vector role should be reinvestigated because P. melanipherus was molecularly detected in the streblid species Brachytarsina allaudi and Raymondia huberi.20 Moreover, infecting stages of a bat malaria parasite (Vetufebrus ovatus Poinar) were previously observed in a streblid specimen.43",

            "text": "The circulation of a wide range of pathogens hosted by vertebrate reservoirs in cave environments constitutes a potential major hazard for the health of humans and domestic animals because of the cave progressive anthropization. Some previous studies have shown that some species of sand flies (for example, Sl. gigas) and mosquitoes (for example, An. hamoni and An. caroni) are opportunistic and can feed on bats, rodents, and occasionally humans.10, 67 Some caves that host large communities of hematophagous dipterans are located in villages, towns, and even in farming concessions.19 This can increase the contact between cavernicolous hematophagous dipterans and humans, thus favouring the accidental transmission of pathogens to humans or livestock. Such contacts and transfers could occur when people or domestic animals enter inside caves, but also via trogloxenic dipteran species that could bring pathogens from inside the cave to the cave surroundings, which may include areas inhabited by human populations. Depending on the pathogen and on the host susceptibility, a new pathogen could emerge in humans and cause local outbreaks, if it can find a suitable vector to ensure its epidemic transmission among humans. Due to their ability to transmit some pathogens, cave-dwelling hematophagous dipterans are of important concern for researchers and health authorities. Among the Diptera-related factors that contribute to the zoonotic hazard of cave environments, the most important are: (i) the ability to support natural enzootic and intra-specific pathogen cycles that involve a natural primary reservoir. This could increase the risk of opportunistic or accidental inter-specific transmission to humans or domestic animals; and (ii) the ability of cave-dwelling hematophagous dipterans, particularly trogloxenic insects, to bite humans or domestic animals, even accidentally. However, contacts between cave fauna and humans are not yet widespread and general, are still restricted to the surrounding populations and only occasionally to far-away victims.",

Indeed, basic data were collected several decades ago by few passionate researchers who made substantial efforts to overcome the inaccessibility and hostile environmental conditions of African caves. This pioneering research was not further pursued, although many questions remain unanswered about the transmission cycles involving arthropod vectors. Recent technical advances (that is, molecular biology and high-throughput sequencing tools for vector taxonomy and pathogen screening) could certainly help filling in these gaps. The renewed interest on cave-dwelling Diptera and associated pathogens, as attested by recent studies in Gabon, provided new insights into the diversity of cave-dwelling insects of medical importance.20 The discovery of several pathogens in cave-dwelling reservoirs using advanced molecular tools68 should help assessing the risk of transfer to humans or domestic animals that live in the vicinity of caves. Indeed pathogen surveillance of wild and domestic animals in cave-associated areas would improve our knowledge on the transmission risk as well as on arthropod-borne pathogens and their associated vectors. Studies on parasite ecology, such as their life cycle and the gonotrophic cycle of vectors, could bring crucial information on how these bioecological features influence pathogen epidemiology in cave-associated areas. Extending research to caves of new areas and to other arthropod groups of medical and veterinary importance, such as bugs, fleas and ticks, will provide integrated data on the diversity, spatial distribution and role in pathogen epidemiology of cave-dwelling hematophagous arthropods.",
