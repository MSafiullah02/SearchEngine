Concurrently, over 200 volunteers signed up and underwent training to staff the multiple \u201cdrive and test\u201d facilities and scale operations. However, to comply with health policies, students were trained in small groups of less than 10, which created time lags and constraints on the quality of the training they received. In more detail, PPE protocol reviews were limited to demonstrations only, leaving many students to don PPE for their first time on-site. A further layer of confusion arose from the fact that \u201cdrive and test\u201d facilities and home visits used different PPE equipment and protocols.",

Ultimately, this left many volunteers unable to log into the new system and view available shifts. This problem was compounded by the fact that the team relied on a single WhatsApp group, of over 250 participants, to disseminate all information related to volunteering. Although it was helpful to access a centralized resource, unless volunteers were checking their messages constantly, information was quickly lost due to the steady stream of new messages.",

For example, volunteers were not given a script to reference before testing individuals. In the first week, a driver stopped their car during testing using only the brake pedal with their car still in gear. Startled during the swabbing process, the driver jerked pressing the accelerator instead and caused an accident. After the incident, volunteers were given a script that, among other things, instructed drivers to put their vehicle in park and engage their parking brake.",

Laboratories have received viral cultures that are unlabeled or contain inaccurate identification stickers; bags and cultures with identification stickers that do not match; as well as missing or illegible patient information on hand-written forms. Coolers have also been left open for extended periods of time between sample collections. If not quickly addressed, these quality control issues will result in wasted resources, repeat testing, and inaccurate results, putting patients and others at risk if left unresolved.",

Subsequently, new volunteers were paired with experienced ones for at least 1 full shift. This was a feasible solution, considering each station already required 2 volunteers: 1 to prepare and log the sample and the other to take the sample from the patient. The pairing strategy helped with oversight between the volunteers without fostering inefficiencies.",
