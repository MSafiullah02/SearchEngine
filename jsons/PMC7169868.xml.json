An aliquot of this APC was tested after 5 min to determine the pretreatment viral infectivity titre. The spiked platelet mixture was then treated with 150 \u00b5m amotosalen and 3 J cm\u22122 UV\u2010A light. Briefly, using a sterile connection device (SCD), the APC container spiked with SARS\u2010CoV was sterile\u2010connected in series with the amotosalen (S\u201059) container (Fig. 1, step 1). The APC in plasma/InterSol was passed through the amotosalen container into the illumination container. The air was expressed out of the illumination container, which contained the platelet concentrate, amotosalen and SARS\u2010CoV and, subsequently, was separated from the amotosalen container by heat seal. In step 2, the amotosalen\u2010platelet mixture was placed in the illumination device. The platelet mixture was exposed to a 3 J cm\u22122 treatment with UV\u2010A with agitation (60 cycles min\u22121). After treatment, a sample was collected for measurement of the post\u2010treatment viral infectivity titre. Each replicate experiment used an independent unit of APC. The infectious viral titre was measured using a standard plaque assay in Vero E6 cells. In the plaque assay, platelet samples were first diluted with tissue culture medium mixed with CaCl2 at a final concentration of 50 \u00b5m and incubated at approximately 37 \u00b0C for at least 1 h to allow time for clot formation, which was then removed by centrifugation. The clot\u2010free supernatant was then used for the viral plaque assay. In two of the five replicates, up to 102 mL, or approximately one\u2010third of the APC unit, were assayed for residual infectious virus. A larger volume was assayed to increase the dynamic range of the plaque assay.",

For this purpose, SARS\u2010CoV Urbani viral infectivity in culture medium was compared with viral infectivity after spiking into platelet concentrate and incubating in the platelet mixture for the duration of the experiment. The results showed a mean decrease of viral infectivity titre of approximately 1 log10 by mixing with platelets. Similarly, SARS\u2010CoV HSR1 was inoculated into the platelet unit. In order not to exceed 1/10 of the total APC volume, 1 ml of viral stock was added to each 30 mL of platelet concentrate. After mixing the virus with the APC, aliquots were removed, and clot formation and retraction was carried out as described in Materials and Methods. The supernatant was then either tested in a plaque infectivity assay or subjected to RNA extraction for quantification of the viral genomes. Incubation of SARS\u2010CoV HSR1 in control APC with no added amotosalen or UV\u2010A light over the period of the experiment resulted in approximately 0\u00b75 log10 reduction in viral titre (from 5\u00b738 \u00b1 0\u00b728\u20134\u00b796 \u00b1 0\u00b741 log10 pfu mL\u22121).

A mean log10\u2010reduction of >6\u00b72 \u00b1 0\u00b72 (range >4\u00b79 to >7\u00b74) was achieved by treatment with the INTERCEPT Blood System. The efficacy of pathogen inactivation of the INTERCEPT Blood System was demonstrated against two different SARS\u2010CoV viral isolates. An effective pathogen inactivation system for blood components must have a broad\u2010spectrum inactivation capability while maintaining the biological properties of the blood components. In the development of the INTERCEPT Blood System for platelets described in this report, studies were performed to demonstrate inactivation of bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and leucocytes in platelet concentrates (Lin et al., 1998; VanVoorhis et al., 2003). In this report, we demonstrate that amotosalen plus UV\u2010A inactivates SARS\u2010CoV, the novel human coronavirus that causes SARS. Effective inactivation was demonstrated against two independent viral isolates. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the two strains employed in this study have a common origin being more similar to those that originated in Hong Kong than those in North China and Taiwan (Vega et al., 2004; Vicenzi et al., 2004). By nucleotide sequence comparison, the Urbani isolate only differs by six nucleotide changes from the HSR1 isolate (Rota et al., 2003; Ruan et al., 2003; Vicenzi et al., 2004). In this regard, the differences between the two isolates are consistent with the low mutation rate of SARS\u2010CoV. SARS\u2010CoV has been shown to have the lowest mutation frequency among RNA viruses (Yeh et al., 2004).",

            "text": "The potential of SARS\u2010CoV transmission through the blood supply is unknown, whereas close contact with symptomatic patients is the main route of transmission (Cheng et al., 2004; Tong & Liang, 2004). SARS\u2010CoV, however, has been detected in blood of infected individuals (Grant et al., 2003; Yam et al., 2003). The current NAT assays have, however, important limitations because they detect the SARS\u2010CoV in only 75% of infected individuals during the first week of symptoms (Yam et al., 2003; Drosten et al., 2004; Ng et al., 2004). False\u2010negative NAT results can occur due to PCR inhibitors or faulty RNA extraction. False\u2010positive NAT results have also been reported with the consequence of triggering alarm bells worldwide (Yu, 2004). Real\u2010time PCR assays have been modified in order to improve specificity and sensitivity (Lau et al., 2003; Poon et al., 2004). The window period for detection of SARS\u2010CoV in blood remains undefined; in this regard, it has been postulated that the time course of SARS\u2010CoV viremia may be relatively short, in that the viral load is too low to be detected 12\u201314 days after the onset of symptoms (Chen et al., 2004; Ng et al., 2004). In addition, the prevalence of individuals infected with the SARS\u2010CoV in high\u2010risk areas remains unknown. A recent report supports the existence of sub clinical or nonpneumonic SARS\u2010CoV infections (Woo et al., 2004). Nonpneumonic SARS\u2010CoV infection was present in healthy blood donors during the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong (Woo et al., 2004), although the levels of SARS\u2010CoV viremia were not reported. Significant correspondence, however, was generated by respondents casting doubt on Woo's findings (Yip et al., 2004; Theron, 2004; Young, 2004; Zhou, 2004). Nevertheless, pathogen inactivation is a proactive approach to blood safety for pre\u2010emptively dealing with new emerging agents before they affect the safety of the blood supply without necessarily knowing the levels of infectious particles in the blood stream. The INTERCEPT Blood System utilizing amotosalen and UV\u2010A light has been shown to inactivate bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and leucocytes (Lin et al., 1997; VanVoorhis et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2004). The INTERCEPT Blood System is a nucleic acid\u2010targeted technology that does not require specific viral sequences. The aggregate data demonstrated that PCT has a broad\u2010spectrum efficacy against a variety of enveloped and non\u2010enveloped, RNA and DNA, known and emerging viruses in platelet concentrates, and therefore, offers the potential to prospectively prevent the majority of platelet transfusion\u2010associated viral diseases.",
