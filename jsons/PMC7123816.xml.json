            "text": "HSA plays an integral role in maintaining the integrity of the vascular barrier. HSA enhances the integrity by electrostatic binding to the negatively charged heparin sulfate side chains of core glycoproteins such as syndecan-1 and glypican-1 of the endothelial glycocalyx via its positively charged arginine residues and enhances the availability of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) produced by red blood cells (RBCs). Extracellular sphingosine is taken up and phosphorylated by RBCs sphingosine kinases (SK) into S1P that is stored in the cell membrane of RBC. S1P is extracted from the RBC membrane by Apo lipoprotein M (ApoM) of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (Apo lipoprotein M is the principal partner of S1P in HDL) and HSA, and this ensures a constant supply of receptor-available S1P for cellular signaling purposes. In contrast to the bond formed between S1P and HDL, HSA facilitates the solubility of S1P in the aqueous solution but not in physical bond to HSA. This unbound S1P is the active form of S1P. It is worth mentioning that one S1P molecule is extracted by 500 serum albumin molecules, indicating that HSA does not physically bind S1P [7\u20139]. S1P activates the G protein-coupled S1P1 receptor, which rapidly activates the Rho family small GTPase Rac1 in the endothelial cells, leading to peripheral localization of cytoskeletal effectors (cortactin and nonmuscle myosin light chain kinase). This localization promotes adherents\u2019 junction (including vascular endothelial-cadherin and associated catenins) and tight junction (occluding, zonula occludens proteins and claudins) formation. Therefore, S1P improves the vascular barrier and stabilizes the endothelial glycocalyx. S1P has been found to reduce matrix metalloproteinase activation, thereby attenuating the loss of endothelial cell surface glycocalyx components. Both actions appear to involve signaling via the S1P receptor [10].",

            "text": "Oxidative stress is defined as a disturbance in pro-oxidant and antioxidant balance leading to damage of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. According to Halliwell and Whiteman, an antioxidant is a substance that, when present at low concentrations compared with those of an oxidizable substrate, significantly delays or prevents oxidation of that substrate [11]. Human serum albumin represents a major antioxidant agent in human plasma. The antioxidant activity of HAS results from the redox properties of the Cysteine 34 (Cys 34) and from metal-binding abilities. Among the metal ligands, copper (Cu) and iron (Fe) are very important, as they are able to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) after a reaction with oxygen. Free Cu (I) and Fe (II) ions can react with H2O2 leading to the formation of the deleterious hydroxyl radical via the Fenton reaction. Cu(I) and Fe(II) binding to HSA promotes their oxidation to Cu(II) and Fe (III), thereby limiting their ability to participate in Fenton reaction. Copper ions bind to HSA with high affinity at the N-terminal tripeptide Asp-Ala-His. The first four amino acids of the N-terminus of HSA, Asp-Ala-His-Lys (DAHK), form a tight binding site for Cu(II) ions. DAHK/Cu has a superoxide dismutase activity, which thereby reduces the ROS generation. By trapping Cu(II), HSA prevents low-density lipoprotein (LDL) lipid peroxidation. Moreover, HSA and the tetrapeptide (DAHK) were shown to prevent neuronal death in murine cell cultures exposed to oxidative stress generated by H2O2/Cu(I)/ascorbic acid reagent [12]. Therefore, the binding of Cu ions with albumin is considered one of the most important antioxidant functions of albumin as Cu can react with H2O2 to hydroxyl radicals 60 times faster than Fe.",

During the first seconds after heme-Fe appearance in plasma, more than 80 % of this powerful oxidizer binds to HDL and LDL, and only the remaining 20 % binds to HSA and hemopexin (HPX). Then, HSA and HPX remove most of the heme-Fe from HDL and LDL. Afterward, heme-Fe transits from HSA to HPX, which releases it into hepatic parenchymal cells after internalization of the HPX-heme-Fe complex by CD91 receptor-mediated endocytosis. It should be mentioned that kinetics of heme-Fe transfer from HDL and LDL to HSA and HPX is faster than the heme-Fe-induced lipoprotein oxidation [13, 14].",

Bilirubin bound to albumin was shown to protect \u03b1(alpha)-tocopherol from damage mediated by peroxyl radicals and to prolong the survival of human ventricular myocytes against in situ\u2013generated oxidative stress [15, 16]. Cholesterol undergoes oxidation in vitro and in vivo, forming biologically active derivatives known as oxysterols. Oxysterols bind to albumin with high affinity. Oxysterols carried by albumin are less rapidly released to cells than cholesterol. By this, albumin could limit detrimental effects of oxysterols on cells. Furthermore, binding homocysteine by HSA protects from atherosclerosis as elevated plasma homocysteine is a well-known risk factor for atherosclerosis (Figs. 9.2 and 9.3) [17].\n\n",

            "text": "Physiologically, HAS exists predominately in a reduced form (i.e., with free thiol, HSA-SH) and is known as mercapto-albumin. However, a small but significant proportion of albumin pool exists as mixed disulfides (HSA-S-S-R); where R represents low-molecular-weight, thiol-containing substances in plasma \u2013 chiefly cysteine and glutathione [18]. Mixed disulfide formation increases as part of the aging process and during disease processes characterized by oxidative stress that enhances endothelial cell damage through oxidative stress and increase in apoptosis levels. Cysteine 34 (Cys 34) represents the largest fraction of free thiol in human plasma, HAS being the most abundant protein in plasma. Cys34 is located at the surface of HAS, close to Aspartate 38 (Asp38), Histidine 39 (His39), and Tyrosine 84 (Tyr 84). These three residues affect the ionization state of Cys34, thus modulating its reactivity [13]. In healthy adults, about 70\u201380 % of the Cys34 in albumin contains a free sulfhydryl group, whereas about 25\u201330 % of the HSA molecules have Cys34 forming a mixed disulfide with either cysteine or homocysteine or glutathione, thus affecting the Cys34 redox potential. Oxidation of Cys34 leads to the formation of sulfenic acid (RSOH), which is further oxidized to sulfinic (RSO2 H) or sulfonic acid form (RSO3 H). Sulfenic acid constitutes a central intermediate in both the reversible and irreversible redox modulation by reactive species. Reactive nitrogen species (RNS) constitute nitrogen-centered species analogous to ROS. RNS such as nitric acid (NO) contribute to various biological processes. HSA acts as a NO depot and a NO transducer. Moreover, 82 % of NO in blood (~7 \u03bc[mu] M) is transported as an S-nitrosothiol bound at the HSA residue Cys34. S-nitrosylated HSA may represent a circulating endogenous reservoir of NO and may act as an NO donor. S-nitrosylated HSA acts primarily as a vasodilator in vivo and represents a stable reservoir of NO that can be released when the concentrations of low-molecular-weight thiols are elevated [19]. S-nitrosylated HSA has been shown to reduce either ischemia or reperfusion injury in pig and rabbit hearts after unprotected warm ischemia through long-lasting release of NO [13]. Other RNS, such as peroxynitrite (ONOO\u2212), constitute powerful oxidants and nitrating species [20]. The -SH group of albumin represents an important antioxidant against peroxynitrite as the thiol group was oxidized to a sulfenic acid (HSA-SOH). Subsequently, HSA-SOH can be converted to a disulfide and then back to mercapto-albumin (HSA-SH). HSA administration favorably influences plasma thiol-dependent antioxidant status, as well as levels of protein oxidative damage in patients with sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [21, 22]. Moreover, HSA is able to scavenge strongly oxidant compounds such as hypochlorous acid (HOCI) and hypothiocyanous acid. Cys34 is oxidized preferentially by hypochlorous and hypothiocyanous acid with the corresponding sulfenyl derivative. HSA is able to scavenge HOCI, preventing alteration of its preferential biological target \u03b1(alpha)1-antiprotease [23]. Interestingly, West Nile virus is neutralized by hypochlorous acid-modified HSA that binds to domain III of the viral envelope protein E [24].",

Diabetes mellitus is one of the main pathological conditions that impairs the antioxidant functions of albumin. In this disease, albumin undergoes increased glycation. The level of glycated HSA in normal humans is about 10 %, and increased to 20\u201330 % in hyperglycemic patients. Glycation corresponds to the nonenzymatic attachment of glucose molecule to a free amine residue. HSA glycation is associated with oxidation of His and Trp residues, main chain fragmentation, and loss of both secondary and tertiary structure. Both the use of diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and aspirin reduces the levels of advanced glycation [25]. The glycation of HSA impairs its antioxidant activity and its copper-binding ability. Glycation of HSA induced a marked loss of its antioxidant activity to copper-mediated oxidation of LDL, probably by the generation of superoxide. Moreover, the Fe(III)-binding antioxidant capacity of HSA is markedly reduced in diabetic patients. Finally, the HSA transport of tryptophan (Trp), which is the largest and essential amino acid, is reduced after its glycation. HSA glycation alters the binding of endogenous and exogenous ligands; in particular, glycation of Lys 199 enhances warfarin binding, but decreases bilirubin affinity [13].",

The esterase activity involving lysine (Lys) 199 is able to split acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) into salicylic acid, which is released and the acetyl group is transferred to especially Lys 199. Therefore, aspirin but not other salicylates induce the aspirin resistance syndrome, as the acetylation of albumin molecule can be allergic. Asthma, rhinitis, and nasal polyps characterize aspirin resistance syndrome. Moreover, Lys 199 and penicillins can covalently bind via an aminolysis, generating a penicilloyl-containing peptide. The covalent labeling of Lys 199 can have clinical consequences. The penicilloyl-HSA complex has no antibacterial activity; however, it represents the major antigenic determinant of penicillin allergy. HSA acts as a phosphotriesterase activity, which thereby inactivates organophosphorus compounds. HSA can catalyze RNA phosphodiester bond cleavage; therefore, it participates in the degradation of endogenous extracellular RNA and of circulating pathogenic nucleic acids. HSA possesses enolase activity toward dihydrotestosterone, converting it from the 3-keto to the 3-enol form. In addition, HSA facilitates the isomerization and the stereoselective hydrolysis of glucuronide conjugates and the removal of glucuronide conjugates, thereby reducing their plasma levels by reversible and/or irreversible binding. Finally, HSA seems to have a significant role in both the biosynthesis and the elimination the prostaglandins. HSA has no enzymatic effects on leukotrienes or thromboxanes. However, it binds and thereby stabilizes thromboxane A2. Binding could play a major role for the inactivation of these potent compounds, diminishing the biological activities of substances that may be harmful for the body if present in too large amounts [6, 13].",

In its long half-life of ~2\u20133 weeks, 1 HSA molecule could make about 15,000 passes through the circulation. HSA is mainly synthesized in the liver. In healthy young adults, about 12\u201325 g of HSA per day is synthesized in polysomes bound to endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. HSA is not stored hepatically and there is therefore no reserve for release on demand [30]. Under physiological circumstances, only 20\u201330 % of hepatocytes produce HSA and its synthesis can be increased up to 200\u2013300 % on demand. HSA synthesis is regulated by colloid osmotic pressure and the osmolality of the interstitial liquid around the hepatocytes. Insulin plays an important role in stimulating HSA synthesis; therefore, diabetic patients could suffer hypoalbuminemia. Estrogens do not affect HSA transcription, but act by modifying the stability of the HSA mRNA. HSA synthesis can be enhanced by corticosteroids, insulin, and amino acids administration. HSA synthesis can be rate-limited by amino acid deficiencies, but these are rarely seen clinically, except in states of extreme starvation and malnutrition [30]. In acute-phase reactions, such as in trauma and the perioperative period, the synthesis of HSA is depressed by hepatic cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1(alpha).",

The long half-lives are attributed to the efficient receptor-mediated recycling pathway involving the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). FcRn is a heterodimer of a nonclassical major histocompatibility class I (MHC I) \u03b1(alpha)-chain and \u03b2(beta)2 microglobulin (\u03b2[beta]2m) that binds the two abundant serum proteins IgG and albumin in the body. FcRn binds both IgG and albumin simultaneously on the opposite sides of the receptor, where the net transport can be basolateral to apical, apical to basolateral, or apical to apical (endothelial cells). FcRn interacts with IgG and albumin in a strictly pH-dependent manner; therefore, it binds them at acidic pH and not at physiological pH. Pinocytosed IgG and albumin bound by the receptor within acidified endosomes are transported back to the cell surface where physiological pH of the blood triggers release of the ligands into the blood circulation. The intracellular nonbound fractions are targeted for lysosomal degradation. FcRn is also largely responsible for transporting the IgG across the placenta whereby the IgG concentration in newborns at term normally exceeds that of the mother. Animals deficient in FcRn catabolize IgG and albumin more rapidly than normal animals and manifest low plasma concentrations of both molecules. Familial hypercatabolic hyoproteinemia, where deficiency of FcRn is due to mutation in \u03b2 (beta) 2m results in hypercatabolism and low plasma concentrations of both albumin and IgG. However, patients with myotonic dystrophy (DM) exhibit plasma deficiency only in IgG but not albumin caused by reduced affinity of FcRn to IgG [35\u201337].",

In 1998, a Cochrane meta-analysis for albumin administration in critically ill patients was published in the British Medical Journal [38]. The average sample size of the selected 32 studies in this meta-analysis was just 46 patients. The results of this meta-analysis showed increased mortality of almost 70 % in patients given albumin. The results of this Cochrane report changed the practice rapidly around the world with dramatic reduction in albumin use especially in Europe. The validity of this meta-analysis has been disputed for several methodological reasons, such as omission of relevant trials, small trials bias, and combination of heterogeneous trials, which included adults and high-risk neonates, inadequate assessment of the effect of methodological quality on outcome, and the absence of a plausible mechanism to explain albumin-associated excess mortality [39, 40]. Moreover, the meta-analysis did not include burns trials in which the mortality rate was lower in albumin [41]. Finally, the crossover pattern in which the most seriously ill patients in the control group were switched to albumin as a rescue measure, therefore, would bias the pooled estimates of relative risk in favor of the control group [40]. Only a few years later, this meta-analysis was followed by an updated meta-analysis, in which 55 trials involving 3,504 randomly assigned patients had been included and 525 deaths occurred [40]. Pooled relative risk estimates among trials with blinding and those with 100 or more patients were 0.73 (CI, 0.48\u20131.12) and 0.94 (CI 0.77\u20131.14), respectively. The relative risk was also consistently less than 1.0 for trials that had two or more of the four attributes indicating higher methodological quality such as blinding, mortality as an endpoint, no crossover, and 100 or more patients. These observations suggest that albumin therapy reduces mortality. Overall, the results of this meta-analysis supported the safety of albumin use in critically ill patients. In 2004, the results of the Saline versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation (SAFE) randomized control trial (RCT) in 7,000 critically ill patients were published, showing that a 4 % albumin solution was as safe as normal saline as resuscitative fluid in critically ill patients [42]. Furthermore, the subgroup analysis of the SAFE study showed benefit of using albumin in patients with severe sepsis, with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) for death of 0.71 (95 % CI, 0.52\u20130.97; P = 0.03) for albumin compared with saline. Therefore, the authors concluded that administration of albumin compared to saline did not impair renal function or organ function and may have decreased the risk of death in patients with severe sepsis [1].",

The use of albumin for resuscitation of patients with sepsis was associated with a reduced mortality, with the odds ratio of 0.82 % (CI 95 % 0.67\u20131.0, P = .047) [1]. Caironi and colleagues randomized 1,818 patients with severe sepsis in 100 ICUs to receive either 20 % albumin and crystalloid solution or crystalloid solution alone. During the first 7 days, patients in the albumin group had a higher mean arterial pressure and lower net fluid balance (P < 0.001). At 28 days the mortality rate was 31.8 % in the albumin group and 32.0 % in the crystalloid group. At 90 days the mortality rate was 41.1 % in the albumin group and 43.6 % in the crystalloid group. However, there was improved survival associated with albumin in patients with septic shock (1,121 patients; 90-day mortality, 43.6 % in the albumin group vs. 49.9 % in the crystalloid group; relative risk 0.87; 95 % CI, 0.77\u20130.99; P = 0.03) [43]. The results of a recent meta-analysis, which included 14 studies (18,916 patients with sepsis), showed that resuscitation with balanced crystalloids or albumin in patients with sepsis seems to be associated with reduced mortality [44]. Furthermore, the improved survival associated with albumin in patients with septic shock was confirmed in a recent meta-analysis. In this meta-analysis, 3,658 with severe sepsis and 2,180 with septic shock patients were included in the analysis [45]. Compared with crystalloid, a trend toward reduced 90-day mortality was observed in severe sepsis patients resuscitated with albumin (OR 0.88; 95 % CI, 0.76\u20131.01; P = 0.08). However, in septic shock patients the use of albumin for resuscitation significantly decreased 90-day mortality (OR 0.81; 95 % CI, 0.67\u20130.97; P = 0.03) [45].",

Albumin therapy resulted in significant increases in arteriolar diameter, and reversing stagnation, thrombosis, and corpuscular adherence within cortical venules in the reperfusion phase after focal ischemia [51]. In a rat model of acute ischemic stroke induced by MCAO, rats received 1.25 g/kg intravenously at 2, 3, 4, or 5 h after onset of MCAO. Albumin therapy markedly improved neurological function, and reduced infarction volume and brain swelling [51]. The neuroprotective effects of albumin have been confirmed in a study with permanent MCAO in rats, where albumin treatment led to 48 % increases in cortical perfusion (P < 0.002), but saline in the control group caused no change [51].",

Albumin administration may improve microcirculatory blood flow, increase organ perfusion, decrease leukocyte rolling and adherence, and reduce the inflammatory response [59]. Albumin preserves the blood brain barrier (BBB) by abolishing the hyperactivation of metalloproteinases \u22122 and \u22129 (MMP-2/9) following subarachnoid hemorrhage, suggesting MMP-2 and MMP-9 are key mediators for the albumin-induced neurovascular protection [53]. Moreover, albumin is considered the major antioxidant agent in the body. Albumin functions as an endogenous nitric oxide (NO) reservoir via binding of its sulfhydryl moiety of cysteine 34 residue with NO to form S-nitrosothiols (RSNO). It is worth mentioning that 82 % of NO in blood is preserved in stable form as RSNO [13]. Therefore, albumin is able to neutralize the excessive circulating NO so as to prevent the nitro-oxidative stress and, on the other hand, to continue to release NO when the concentrations of low-molecular thiols are elevated. Thereby, albumin via RSNO-adducted NO can relax blood vessels, inhibit platelet aggregation, and increase aortic blood flow [53].",

However, the use of low molar hydroxyethyl starch solutions (HES) (6 % 200/0.5 or 130/0.4) resulted in prolongation in clot formation time and reduction in maximum clot firmness [67]. Moreover, the use of old high-molar HES and gelatin solutions correlated with the amount of postoperative bleeding after cardiac surgery, but the use of 4 % albumin solution did not [68]. The same results have been confirmed in a meta-analysis comparing the use of HES solutions with albumin. Hemodynamics were similar in both groups, but the use of albumin decreased blood loss, the amount of blood products transfusions, and the need for reoperation postoperatively [69]. The presence of hypoalbuminemia (cutoff 18 g/L) after cardiac surgery was found to be a better predictor for mortality after cardiac surgery \u2013 even better than EUROscore [70]. In a recently published prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the preemptive correction of a low preoperative albumin level by administering HSA in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) is associated significant reduction in the incidence of AKI, from 26 % in the control group to 13.7 % in the albumin group. The editorial that accompanied the study has suggested that restoring the target level is associated with reduction in AKI in amplitude greater than that of any known intervention in patients undergoing OPCAB [71, 72].",
