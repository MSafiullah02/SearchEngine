Studies aiming at unraveling the underlying mechanisms of NET formation demonstrated a requirement for the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)2\u20135. ROS induces actin and tubulin glutathionylation, which is tightly regulated by glutaredoxin 1 (Grx1), an enzyme required for deglutathionylation of actin and microtubulin. Thus, an intact cytoskeleton is required for the formation of NETs6. Moreover, optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), one of five GTPase dynamin family members, known to play a role in mitochondrial (mt) fusion, has recently been shown to be required for ATP production through glycolysis in neutrophils. If increases in ATP production are blocked, the assembly of the microtubule network and thus the formation of NETs do not occur7. ATP and ATP channel pannexin 1 (Panx1) contribute to NET formation and may represent therapeutic targets8.",

Over the last decade, a number of stimuli, microbial and noninfectious stimuli, able to induce extracellular trap formation have been identified12\u201316. It should be noted that there is an ongoing scientific dispute whether NET formation requires cell death or not17\u201320. In this article, we focus on the current evidence of DNA traps under in vivo conditions and discuss their possible role(s) in the disease pathogenesis. These studies suggest that extracellular DNA traps exert effects beyond host defense, including allergic diseases, cancer, vascular diseases, and coagulation. This assumption is best supported by the observation that besides granulocytes, activated T cells, B cells, NK cells, and monocytes are also able to release mtDNA forming extracellular web-like structures, but the latter are devoid of bactericidal proteins. However, these structures containing mtDNA are able to provoke a rapid type I interferon (IFN-I) production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting that lymphocytes and monocytes use mtDNA as a rapid signaling molecule to communicate danger21. Interestingly, mtDNA being enriched in unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) dinucleotide motifs similar to bacterial and viral DNA could provoke IL-10 secretion21,22, and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) release23. IL-10 is known to be an anti-inflammatory cytokine24, and TGF-\u03b2 mediates the suppression of macrophage-directed inflammation, reducing TNF-\u03b1 release25. Combination of anti-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines could dampen the excess inflammation (Fig. 1a).",

Measuring DNA concentrations in the absence or presence of granule proteins is clearly insufficient for concluding the presence of NETs or EETs, but in combination with (immuno)-histological investigations (Fig. 2), these techniques might be used for possible quantification. For example, increased DNA concentrations can occur as a consequence of a lytic granulocyte death (Fig. 1b), but also as a result of tissue damage that is a frequent phenomenon with inflammatory responses. Moreover, in contrast to in vitro conditions, the exact type of stimulus, its dosage and exposure time cannot be assessed under in vivo condition. With these limitations in mind, the reader may understand that the interpretation of the available studies is difficult and it is thus impossible, owing to space limitations, to critically evaluate all cited published findings. We sometimes just reflect the cited work, as it was reported by the original authors. Nevertheless, we often also mention a note of caution.",

Neutrophils abundantly released NETs, and the NET length that was highest during acute infection and shortened with the recovery, correlated with clinical and laboratory signs of infection, as well as inflammatory cytokine levels in serum28. In an animal model of acute respiratory distress syndrome, in which neutrophil infiltration promotes tissue injury and sustained inflammation, the content of cf DNA in bronchoalveolar fluid was significantly higher in mice injected with LPS from Escherichia coli as compared with controls, and was decreased by glutamine treatment29. It should be noted, however, that in these two studies, NET formation and DNA concentrations were analyzed ex vivo using BAL fluids. To compensate for this shortcoming, lung tissue biopsies should be stained for NET detection in order to confirm the ex vivo data. In addition, cf DNA as well as granule and histone proteins are often quantified as \u201cin vivo NET formation\u201d30. Clearly, it is impossible to distinguish whether the released DNA/protein complexes are owing to NET formation or neutrophil death31,32, the latter of which was reported to occur under in vivo conditions more than 50 years ago33,34.",

Several reports have argued that PAD4 activity is essential for NET formation14,35\u201341, and contrary others disputed that PAD4 is not crucial for NET formation or the antimicrobial defense mechanism in vivo42\u201345. Specifically, NET formation in Klebsiella pneumonia-induced pneumonia was investigated showing NET-like structures surrounding Klebsiella bacteria at sites of immune infiltration in both Pad4\u2212/\u2212 and Pad4+/+ mice. Moreover, both groups showed similar bacterial growth, lung inflammation, and organ injury.

It has been reported that CF neutrophils have a pro-survival phenotype that allows increased NET production, which can in turn induce inflammation46. However, it should be noted that this conclusion is based mainly on ex vivo data. Both mucoid and non-mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were demonstrated to activate neutrophils to generate NETs, a process that is promoted by macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)47. Moreover, MIF protein levels in the blood of CF patients were significantly elevated compared with MIF levels in pooled human serum from healthy controls and negatively correlated with lung function47. On the other hand, the development of mucoidy (i.e., increased alginate production) is an acquired Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence factor that is closely associated with increased severity of CF. The conversion to a mucoid phenotype coincided with a decline in susceptibility to NETs, raising the possibility that increased alginate production decreases interactions with NETs, or otherwise interferes with killing by NET-associated granule proteins48.",

In order to unravel the mechanism of organ damage, a mouse model was applied. Intravenous infection with multi-resistant Staphylococcus aureus led to a rapid sequestration of the bacteria to the liver, neutrophil recruitment and NET formation within the liver sinusoids, and subsequent liver damage14. As neutrophil elastase (NE), a component of NETs, was demonstrated to be enzymatically active and NE staining observed in areas adjacent to focal necrosis, the authors concluded that NET formation largely contributes to liver damage14.

Its pathogenesis involves defective clearance of immune complexes and debris containing nucleic acids, excessive innate immune activation involving Toll-like receptors (TLR) and type I interferons, as well as aberrant lymphocyte activation71. Upon stimulation with antimicrobial72 or anti-ribonucleoprotein (RNP) antibodies13,73,74, neutrophils from SLE patients have been shown to release self-DNA associated with antimicrobial peptides able to trigger innate plasmocytoid dendritic cell (pDC) activation via TLR9 to produce IFN-\u0399 (Fig. 1). The immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis in SLE has been associated with a non-lytic extrusion of NETs concomitant with clustering of neutrophils within minutes that have immunogenic properties, including enrichment for high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1), oxidized mtDNA, and immune complex (ICx) formation13,73,75. By applying immunofluorescence staining, NETs composed of mtDNA and MPO have been detected in affected glomeruli66. Moreover, the proportion of glomeruli infiltrated by netting neutrophils correlates with lupus nephritis activity. The fact that NETs containing MPO as well as intact neutrophils are present in the dermis and dermal blood vessels of cutaneous lupus lesions suggests that enhanced NET formation occurs in vivo in affected organs of SLE patients76. SLE patients were found to develop autoantibodies to both the self-DNA and antimicrobial peptides present in NETs, indicating that these complexes serve as autoantigens to trigger B-cell activation. NETs containing cathelicidin LL-37\u2013DNA complexes can directly trigger human memory B cells and induce the production of anti-neutrophil and anti-LL-37 antibodies in B cells of SLE patients (Fig. 1)77.",

On the other hand, NETs with their components mtDNA, PR3, and MPO have been shown to be taken up by myeloid dendritic cells (mDC), significantly inducing the production of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) and anti-dsDNA autoantibodies in mice immunized with NET-loaded mDC83. Therefore, both NET-induced autoimmunity as well as autoantibody-mediated NET formation seem to represent a vicious circle in disease pathogenesis. Similarly, drug-induced formation of NETs enriched in NE serving as auto-antigen, together with the release of B-cell activating factor (BAFF) resulting in B-cell activation, and the production of ANCA directed against NE that further enhance NET formation, have been assumed to be pathogenic mechanisms in cocaine and levamisole-associated autoimmunity84.

It has been shown that in prebullous lesions, a small subgroup of eosinophils have formed EETs consisting of mtDNA associated with eosinophil granular proteins26. Some of these EET were directed against the dermal\u2013epidermal junction, the site where blister formation occurs26. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) has been identified as a cytokine-stimulating eosinophils to form EETs, an observation that might be relevant for BP since TSLP is expressed in the epidermis and eosinophils infiltrating BP lesions express the TSLP receptor10. In an ex vivo skin model, eosinophils stimulated with IL-5 in the presence of BP serum caused a dermal\u2013epidermal splitting resembling BP. This splitting was significantly decreased upon adding DNase I, suggesting that EET formation plays at least a partial role90. These observations make eosinophils interesting targets for therapy91. A recent study reported the presence of NETs at sites of blister formation in BP that decreased with time following treatment in patients undergoing remission92.",

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is characterized by neutrophilia and neutrophil infiltration in affected tissues during inflammatory attacks induced by physical or psychological stress. In vitro, the amounts of NETs consisting of DNA associated with NE and interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, released by PMNs isolated from FMF patients during attack were significantly higher compared with those in remission, when PMNs were resistant to stimuli usually inducing NET formation94. Abundant infiltrates of neutrophils forming NETs have been reported in Schnitzler syndrome, defined by recurrent urticarial rash, monoclonal gammopathy, and systemic inflammation95. Flares of sterile arthritis with neutrophil infiltrate and the overproduction of IL-1\u03b2 are the main features of pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum and acne (PAPA) syndrome. NETs have been identified in the skin lesions of a patient with active PAPA syndrome in a milieu characterized by IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, and IL-17A expression, but not in skin samples from a patient with no active skin lesions96. In vitro, serum of PAPA patients induced NET formation by neutrophils from healthy donors that could be blocked by the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra, suggesting that IL-1\u03b2 contributes to the enhanced NET formation in PAPA96.",

In bronchial biopsies, EETs consisting of a mtDNA scaffold co-localizing with MBP were seen in all asthma patients, and their number correlated with the number of eosinophils97. A subgroup of patients expressed a high level of neutrophils and NETs, in which the extracellular mtDNA was associated with NE97. In an animal model of asthma, the treatment with deoxyribonuclease, which cleaves extracellular DNA, resulted in an improvement of airway resistance and abolished extracellular DNA content in BALF as well as goblet cell hyperplasia98. Peripheral blood eosinophils from patients with severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA) may be more activated to produce EETs than those from patients with non-severe asthma (NSA), which further induces inflammation in asthmatic airways99. Surfactant protein-D (SP-D), an epithelial cell product of the airways, is a critical immune regulatory molecule with a multimeric structure susceptible to oxidative modifications. We have demonstrated that SP-D directly binds to the eosinophil membrane, inhibits EET formation, and reduces asthma exacerbations100. NETs have also been visualized in induced sputum from patients with asthma and COPD, which compared with control sputum, exhibited higher levels of extracellular DNA and other NET components, such as cathelicidin LL-37, alpha-defensin 1\u20133, NE, IL-1\u03b2, and CXCL8 correlating with decreased lung function101. In stable COPD patients, extensive NET formation was observed in all sputum samples irrespective of purulence or smoking status102,103.

For initiating arterial thrombosis in injured vessels, the interaction of neutrophils with endothelial cells is a critical step preceding platelet accumulation119. Activated lesional smooth muscle cells (SMCs) may attract neutrophils that undergo neutrophil death (not NET formation), releasing nuclear proteins, including histone H4, which induce lytic cell death of smooth muscle cells causing the destabilization of plaques. Neutralization of histone H4 led to a plaque stabilization, whereas blocking histone H2A or disrupting DNA structures by DNase had no effect on smooth muscle cells120. A significant decrease in infarction size and reduction of citrullinated histone 3 in infarcted tissue were demonstrated upon blocking of CCL5 and CXCL4 in mice, what was believed to be due to a reduced neutrophil recruitment121. In a model of myocardial infarction, Pad4\u2212/\u2212 mice were significantly protected from, whereas mice without PAD4 deficiency had myocardial injury with the presence of citrullinated histone H3 at the site of injury and increased plasma levels for nucleosomes122. Our interpretation of these findings is that a lytic neutrophil death might be prevented in the absence of PAD4. Therefore, a lytic neutrophil death and not of NET formation seems to be important for atherothrombosis.",

Moreover, cancer cells themselves are able to stimulate neutrophils to form NETs that facilitate cancer cell migration and invasion as shown in vitro and in vivo, indicating that they make use of a physiological host defense mechanism process to promote metastasis (Fig. 4)142. Mechanisms by which cancer cells may stimulate neutrophils to form NETs are the production of IL-8 and the release of exosomes requiring additional priming with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (Fig. 4)142,143. More recently, it was reported that anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) cells induce the release of mitochondrial extracellular DNA traps by viable neutrophils. ATC conditioned medium (CM)\u2013primed neutrophils promoted ATC cell proliferation in a NET-dependent manner144. Furthermore, tumor cells have been demonstrated to produce IL-8, attracting myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and activating granulocytic MDSC to extrude DNA nets145. In addition, by applying intravital microscopy, a significant increase in the in vivo hepatic adhesion of intrasplenically injected lung or colon cancer cells was observed in the presence of NETs when compared with animals, in which NET formation had been prevented146. Although tumor-infiltrating neutrophils were rare in tissue specimens of epithelial ovarian cancer, both intact neutrophils and NETs were observed in tumors from 4 of 5 patients147. Moreover, in ascites supernatants of patients with advanced tumors, high mtDNA, and NE levels were found that correlated with reduced progression-free survival148.",

Similarly, surgical stress employing liver ischemia reperfusion resulted in an increase in NET formation with subsequent development and progression of metastatic disease, while pretreatment of mice with topical DNase application or a PAD4 inhibitor abrogated these effects150. Consistent with the observation in mice, increased postoperative NET formation inversely correlated with disease-free survival times in a cohort of patients undergoing attempted curative liver resection for metastatic colorectal cancer150. It should be noted, however, these authors measured serum levels of MPO\u2013DNA complexes and did not directly analyze NET formation.

If the source of infection/stimulation persists, the released mtDNA, having similarity to viral and bacterial DNA (enriched in unmethylated CpG motifs), acts as a danger signal and triggers cytokine production for a protective and regulated immune response7,55. b Cytolysis: Under pathological conditions, such as the persistent presence of foreign antigens104, \u201ctoo large to be trapped antigens\u201d, such as fungal hyphae60,61, strong adhesion receptor activation153\u2013155, presence of monosodium urate (MSU)88, or phorbol-myristate-acetate (PMA) stimulation2,12, results in an excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to neutrophil cytolysis. Similarly, excessive increases in intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i by ionomycin results in non-apoptotic neutrophil death12,81. Certain bacteria are also capable of causing neutrophil cytolysis by releasing pore-forming toxins that can directly cause plasma cell and nuclear membrane permeabilization156\u2013159. The externalized cell exudates containing cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins together with damaged nuclear DNA can act as so-called self-antigens (Self-Ag) that are recognized and processed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Activated APCs produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and stimulate autoreactive T and B cells, leading to autoantibody production. The circulating autoantibodies such as anti-damaged-DNA/RNA ribonucleoprotein antibody immune complexes (RNP-ICs-Ab) can further activate neutrophils, including NET formation (not shown)13,73,74, leading to vicious cycle of chronic inflammation in genetically susceptible individuals68,74, causing autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematous (SLE).",
