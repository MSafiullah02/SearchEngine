            "text": "Cancer and efforts to treat cancer are described in Ancient Egyptian documents dating back to 1600B.C. The fi rst successful cancer treatments were arsenic-based therapies for leukemias, with the fi rst reported application to cancer in the nineteenth century [ 1 ] . However, nitrogen mustards are often accredited as the fi rst modern chemotherapy. Originally intended as a chemical warfare agent in World War I, nitrogen mustard was stockpiled by several countries. During World War II, Axis bombers sunk a ship containing large quantities of nitrogen mustard and killed numerous Allied sailors. Autopsies revealed that most of the victims' white blood cells were depleted, suggesting that the nitrogen mustard destroyed these cells or inhibited cell division of these cells. This observation birthed the hypothesis that nitrogen mustards might prevent the rapid division of cancer cells, one of the few properties of cancer understood at that time. Today, the hallmarks of cancer as recently redefi ned by Hanahan and Weinberg [ 2 ] include several complex and connected cellular properties that allow for this phenotype: resistance to cell death, sustained angiogenesis, limitless ability to replicate, self-suffi ciency in growth factor signaling, unresponsiveness to anti-growth factor signaling, genomic instability and mutation, deregulating cellular energetics, evading immune-mediated destruction, oncogenic infl ammation, and invasiveness and metastasis [ 3 ] . The iden-tifi cation and understanding of these hallmarks is a direct result of our molecular understanding of cancer that has surfaced relatively recently. Each of these hallmarks is determined by a host of molecules which together represent distinct therapeutic opportunities to target molecules that give rise to these defi ning properties of cancer ( Fig. 38.1 ). The National Cancer Act of 1971 , signed by President Richard Nixon, declared \"\u2026 war on cancer \u2026\" and announced full Congressional and presidential support to eradicate the disease. As a result of increased funding and technological advancements, our understanding of cancer biology on the genetic and molecular level has exploded. Today, cancer phenotypes are associated with genetic and molecular culprits along with complex networks of various regulatory mechanisms that together cause and sustain cancer. Superfi cially, the genes capable of inducing carcinogenesis are divided into two categories. The fi rst is a tumor suppressor , which is a gene that if inactivated, restricts cell division. Genes that confer pro-survival changes if activated are oncogenes. Intuitively, tumor suppressors such as p53 are commonly inactivated in cancer while oncogenes such as myc are activated and/or overexpressed. These carcinogenic changes manifest themselves by a number of avenues including overexpression, mutations, deletions, loss or gain of alleles, epigenetic modifi cations that alter genomic structure, alternative splicing, interference with the translation and transcription of the gene, chaperone-mediated protein folding, protein degradation processes, and posttranslational modifi cations that modulate localization, protein-protein interactions, and/or activity of the protein. Whether some of these changes occur simultaneously, sequentially, or otherwise is highly context-dependent and debated. Furthermore, the functional consequences of these alterations have a wide range of effects through crosstalk in cell signaling pathways. In the background of cancer-associated genomic instability, these wide-spread alterations and the functional redundancy of various genes provide a breeding ground for therapeutic resistance and make targeting cancer cells at the molecular level a challenging feat.",

            "text": "Radiation, surgical resection, and chemotherapy still comprise the vast majority of fi rst-line cancer therapy today. While chemotherapy has yielded enormous patient benefi t it is often accompanied by side effects that limit dose and therefore effi cacy. Traditional chemotherapy is based on the notion that cancer cells divide more rapidly than normal cells and consequently will be differentially affected by an inhibitor of cell division. However, many types of normal cells need to divide for normal function. Our increased understanding of cancer has yielded numerous molecular targets for cancer therapy that may be less necessary for normal cell function and therefore may be less toxic. For instance, most normal cells divide a fi nite number of times, which is called the Hayfl ick limit. When cells divide, the ends of their chromosomes termed telomeres shorten as result of the DNA replication process, a phenomenon called the end replication problem . Upon reaching a critical telomere length, cells stop dividing and enter a dormant state referred to as cellular senescence. Cancer cells must evade senescence as they need to propagate indefi nitely. Cancer cells escape this phenomenon by activating telomerase, an endogenous enzyme capable of elongating telomeres. As this oncogenic process is essential to cancer cells but not essential to most types of normal cells, telomerase is an attractive target for cancer therapy. Several types of inhibitors targeting various aspects of the telomerase molecular machinery and function are being investigated as a novel cancer therapy. There have been and continue to be efforts to discover therapies that alter the function of cancer-specifi c targets such as this. The rise of targeted therapies over the past two decades is a result of the rich marriage of our modern tools to understand cancer and our ancient desire to cure it. This chapter details the discovery, translation, development, and exemplifi ed therapeutic concepts of several novel cancer therapies that specifically target oncoproteins and have molded how we discover and develop novel therapies today (Fig. 38.2 ).",

Small molecules offer a vast range of activity: sucrose sweetens foods and beverages, sodium pentothal is lethal, and amoxicillin can cure many bacterial infections. Our expanding knowledge in chemistry enables us to modify small molecules in nature or our synthetic libraries and create new molecules with altered functions, just as a cell does. Our understanding and ability to produce biological molecules on a therapeutic scale has been a relatively recent endeavor, therefore chemotherapies are almost entirely composed of small molecules.

            "text": "Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a cancer that causes increased amounts of white blood cells and is almost always associated with a specifi c translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22. The resulting shorter chromosome 22 is known as the Philadelphia chromosome, a tribute to the city housing the researchers who identifi ed this in 1960s. The Philadelphia chromosome encodes a fusion of the two genes that results in the production Bcr-Abl. Abl is a tyrosine kinase that becomes constitutively active in the gene fusion product. This unregulated kinase activity causes oncogenic cell signaling shown to be suffi cient to induce leukemia in mice. As a poster-child for translating modern cancer knowledge to clinical benefi t, imatinib has signifi cantly improved CML patient response rates. The FDA approved imatinib in 2001 for the treatment of CML as the fi rst cancer therapy to target an intracellular molecule. Imatinib is a direct result of medicinal chemistry performed on a molecule identifi ed as a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor [ 4 ] . Chemical modifi cation of the PKC inhibitor altered the specifi city of the molecule and rendered the derivative a potent inhibitor of v-abl [ 5 ] , c-kit, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) [ 6 ] . All of these proteins are receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that bind extracellular factors and transduce the signal by phosphorylating specifi c protein substrates. The observation that imatinib inhibits Abl and BCR-Abl led to preclinical development and ultimately clinical trials of imatinib as a cancer therapy for CML. The concept of taking the currently available knowledge of a particular target and identifying a way to alter its function for therapeutic benefi t is known as rational drug design. Structural biology has played a key role in understanding how molecules look, how they move, how they interact with other molecules, and how all of these things change in different environments. Computational molecular docking in concert with an X-ray crystallographic structure of the catalytic domain of Abl bound to imatinib revealed that imatinib binds to the ATP-binding site of Abl preferentially when the protein is in the inactive form ( Fig. 38. 3 ) [ 7 , 8 ] . The crystal structure also showed that a chemical group added to increase solubility also forms hydrogens bonds with two residues of Abl. The insight gained from such structures provides an understanding of how and where a drug binds, what types of interactions are formed, and what role each residue or functional group plays. Due to the relatively facile excision and crystallization of the catalytic domains of many kinases, several atomic structures of these proteins are freely available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) . This provides fertile ground for numerous applications of computational chemistry to foster drug discovery and development. In addition to structural biology, medicinal chemistry also provides insight into the function of particular atoms of a molecule while searching for a more therapeutically potent derivative. The drug development process typically begins by identifi cation of lead molecules using various screening techniques that search for a desired effect. Validation of these leads and optimization by medicinal chemistry ensues to identify the most promising compound to continue to develop. The process of lead optimization and elucidative structural biology intrinsically discerns the role of particular parts of drug and target molecules in the activity of the drug, giving rise to structureactivity relationships (SARs).",

            "text": "All of the kinases in the human genome, called the kinome, share a high degree of sequence and structural homology. This means that identifying inhibitors that are specifi c for a given kinase is challenging and often kinase inhibitors have multiple targets. Imatinib is no exception, as it inhibits autophosphorylation of c-KIT, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and ARG [ 9 ] kinases in addition to BCR-ABL. c-KIT is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is almost ubiquitously mutated in gastrointestinal tumors (GISTs) during the transformation of interstitial cells of Cajal located in the gastrointestinal tract. This mutation typically occurs in exon 11 of the c-Kit gene, which results in constitutive autophosphorylation of the protein that continually activates downstream pro-survival signaling that is oncogenic. The observation that imatinib inhibits c-KIT lead to preclinical development and clinical trials with the treatment of GISTs. Seven years after its approval for treatment of advanced CML, the FDA approved imatinib for treatment of GISTs following surgical removal of the tumor. This extension of clinical applications demonstrates a few key concepts in cancer therapy. Firstly, exclusive specifi city of a cancer drug for a molecular target is a virtue rooted in our movement toward targeted therapy. We know that without specifi city, effects on normal cells can yield side effects that are deleterious. However the distinction should be made that while cancer therapies should target cancer-specifi c properties, this does not have to be accomplished by targeting a single molecule. It is conceivable that evolving therapeutic resistance is easier against a single target rather than an array of molecules. Furthermore, different types of tumors seem to rely on alterations in multiple genes and so multiple targets may allow for broader spectrum and more potent antitumor activity. The clinical extension of imatinib to GISTs also underscores the importance of identifying and understanding the molecular targets of therapies and how they fi t with our molecular understanding of cancer. The application of a therapy used in distantly related clinical settings is a concept that continues today. Such applications are often a direct result of rational drug design and typically have an expedited timeline for starting clinical trials as they have already been tested in humans. The time and cost associated with development of cancer therapies is astounding, taking an average of over 14 years and $2 billion to reach FDA approval of a cancer drug with a success rate of just over 7 % [ 10 ] . Clearly, reducing the time spent in early phase trials profi ling safety of the drug would reduce cost and expedite evaluation and patient benefi t.",

While our cells copy our genome during cell division with amazing fi delity, the molecular machinery that performs this task is not completely error free. This endogenous source of mutations, environmental mutagens such as UV radiation or tobacco, and the genomic instability associated with cancer provide a suffi cient source of heritable variability. Cancer treatments serve as a selective force for the cancer cells. Imagine yourself looking at population of millions of CML cells circulating in the blood that have the oncogenic Bcr-Abl fusion gene. Now introduce imatinib into the blood stream, which inhibits Bcr-Abl, and watch as the CML cells begin to die due to their dependency on the function of this oncogenic protein. If any single cell out of these millions of CML cells evolved into cancer by a process not involving BCR-ABL or can continue to divide using other oncogenic alterations, the cell will survive and continue to divide. The entire offspring of such cells will not rely on BCR-ABL to propagate and thus the patient will now not respond to therapies that target BCR-ABL. The enhanced sources of genetic variability and the solitary goal to divide more rapidly give rise to heterogeneity of tumors. This heterogeneity has signifi cant implications as to how cancer is diagnosed and managed.",

            "text": "There are several ways that cancer cells get around therapeutic road blocks in intracellular signaling to keep propagating. In the case of imatinib, mechanisms of resistance include increasing the amount of Bcr-Abl to saturate the drug, mutating Bcr-Abl to still be constitutively active in the presence of imatinib, bypassing BCr-Abl and activating its downstream targets to achieve the same end goal, or simply getting rid of the drug altogether. Following the fi rst route, cell culture and patient data revealed that overexpression of Bcr-Abl by gene duplication occurred in refractory patients and that this was suffi cient for imatinib resistance [ 11 -14 ] . Additionally, several patients were found to have mutations in the BCR-ABL that allowed for sustained signaling in the presence of imatinib. Due to the availability of the drug-bound crystal structure of the Abl catalytic domain, the effects of these point mutations were rationalized at the molecular level. Another intriguing avenue of drug resistance is getting rid of drugs by upregulating molecular effl ux pumps localized at the cell membrane. The most characterized member of this family of proteins that induce multidrug resistance is p-glycoprotein (PgP), exhibiting broad substrate specifi city to include several chemotherapies such as vinblastine, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel. Upregulation of PgP was also found in imatinib-resistant clones and in advanced CML patients. Pharmacological inhibition of multidrug resistance proteins is being explored in clinical trials in combination with chemotherapy with mixed success [ 15 -19 ] . Strategies to circumvent imatinib resistance in the clinic include increasing the dose, changing to other investigational therapies, and administering alternative Bcr-Abl inhibitors such as nilotinib and dasatinib. Nilotinib and particularly dasatinib also target Sarc-family kinase (Src) and have signifi cantly improved patient outcome after imatinib failure [ 20 -29 ] . Treating patients that are resistant to fi rst-line therapies is a challenge in clinical oncology and is a major barrier in getting an investigational drug approved as these are often tested in these refractory patients.",

Growth factor signaling typically involves the binding of an extracellular factor by a transmembrane receptor on the cell surface, which triggers intracellular signaling events. These events such as substrate phosphorylation ultimately allow for cellular proliferation through various mechanisms such as turning on transcription factors that activate genes necessary for cell cycle progression. One group of receptors that mediate several of such signals is the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family and as a consequence, this family is commonly altered by mutations and/or overexpression in a wide range of solid tumors. These receptors form homo-or hetero-oligomers upon binding various ligands to trigger a range of intracellular signaling events via Ras/Raf/MAPK, PI3K/Akt, STAT, or Src kinase pathways. EGFR is one member of this family that homodimerizes upon binding and induces proliferation through ERK, PI3K/ Akt, Ras, and STAT signaling pathways. Due to the frequency of their alteration in a variety of cancers and its plethora of potent downstream oncogenic targets, the EGFR family members have successfully targeted by a number of therapeutic approaches over the past two decades.",

Preclinical studies found that gefi tinib had cooperative to synergistic combinations with several chemotherapies in EGFR-overexpressing cancer cell lines [ 32 ] . Interestingly, another group reported similar effects with gefi tinibchemotherapy combinations but in cancer cell lines with low EGFR expression [ 33 ] . Oral and intravenous administration of gefi tinib in rats and dogs found the bioavailability of the drug to be ~50 % and that the drug was well distributed throughout the body [ 34 ]. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies indicated that oral administration of gefi tinib at 100-700 mg/ day was well tolerated, had a terminal half-life between 1 and 2 days, and reached serum concentrations that inhibited 90 % of EGFR activity in vitro [ 35 -39 ] . The fi rst phase I trial of gefi tinib was a dose escalation study in patients with various solid tumors that reported objective partial responses in NSCLC patients at oral doses ranging 300-700 mg per day on a 14 days-on, 14 days-off schedule [ 40 ] . The observed dose range with antitumor activity was below the doselimiting toxicity (DLT) reported and was corroborated with another phase I trial [ 41 ] . These clinical trials used high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with mass spectrometry (MS) to monitor serum concentrations of gefitinib [ 42 ] .",

            "text": "HPLC along with complementary molecular identifi cation techniques are often employed in clinical trials involving small molecules. HPLC allows for the separation and quantifi cation of molecules based on their absorbance and interactions with a solid matrix. Molecular properties such as size and charge along with instrument and solvent parameters determine how the molecule interacts with this matrix. These interactions determine how long the molecule takes to migrate through the matrix column. HPLC conditions are optimized to allow for quantitative identifi cation of a given molecule based on this empirically determined elution time, called retention time. The calculated serum concentrations can then be used to determine a plethora of pharmacokinetic parameters. These parameters are particularly important in guiding dosing schedules of new therapies and rationalizing patient responses. This technique is often coupled with mass spectrometry to allow for further verifi cation that the molecule identifi ed at a particular retention time is indeed the target molecule. Mass spectrometry is an electromagnetic separation method that distinguishes molecules based on their size to charge ratio of ionized forms of the molecule, which are generated by molecular collisions. Together, these ionized fragments yield a unique fi ngerprint for each molecule. Coupling HPLC and mass spectrometry has been instrumental in increasing the accuracy and reliability of pharmacokinetic data and identifying metabolites of drugs. Direct and indirect modifi cations of drugs often occur once delivered due to the staggeringly diverse mixture of molecules presence in the blood, digestive system, etc. As for gefi tinib, HPLC-MS identifi ed desmethyl-gefi tinib as a metabolite of gefi tinib that is inactive in vitro and in vivo [ 43 ] . Identifi cation of metabolites is important for understanding and monitoring the various molecular species responsible for therapeutic activity as well as guiding chemical optimization.",

With data available from phase III clinical trials, the FDA granted accelerated approval for gefi tinib as a third-line therapy in NSCLC in 2003. This type of approval is granted based on promising clinical evidence of effi cacy when there is no current therapy for a particular clinical setting. However, this approval is temporary and full approval is contingent on a more complete clinical data set. In the few years following accelerated approval of gefi tinib, several studies found responses in the overall population of NSCLC patients [ 44 -46 ] . However, a small subset of responders was identifi ed amongst these trials with the following characteristics: female, Asian, never-smokers, adenocarcinoma, and mutant EGFR [ 46 -48 ] . Several other studies confi rmed effi cacy of gefi tinib in NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations [ 49 -52 ] though no benefi t was found in NSCLC patients with EGFR gene amplifi cation [ 53 ] . A breakthrough study published in 2004 found that the majority of gefi tinib responders had EGFR deletions or point mutations clustered at the ATPbinding site of EGFR, which results in a ten-fold increase in sensitivity to gefi tinib [ 54 ] . Others studies corroborated these EGFR alterations in gefi tinib-responsive patients [ 55 , 56 ] . These genetic alterations were structurally modeled and rationalized using the crystal structure of the human EGFR kinase domain bound to gefi tinib ( Fig. 38.4 ) [ 57 ] . These response-determining mutations occur at the active site of the kinase domain in structural regions that are responsible for autoregulation of kinase activity. Further studies found that these particular mutations in EGFR stabilize the active form of the kinase and shift its affi nity from ATP toward gefitinib [ 58 ] .",

Subsequent clinical trials have supported gefi tinib following chemotherapy resistance [ 59 , 60 ] . Together, the clinical trials comparing gefi tinib and chemotherapy are confusing as they conclude signifi cant to no benefi t of gefitinib over chemotherapy. These confl icting results have been ascribed to fundamental differences in the therapeutic mechanisms of chemotherapy and targeted therapy, differences in patient populations, and biomarker selection and technique accuracy [ 61 ] . Recent studies have supported gefi tinib as a fi rst-line therapy due to demonstrated superiority over standard of care therapy in mutant EGFR NSCLC patients [ 62 -64 ] . This data is anticipated to extend the restricted use label of gefi tinib to its use as a fi rst-line therapy in NSCLC patients with mutant EGFR.

One particular EGFR member, Her2, does not bind ligands but can form heterodimers with other ligand-bound family members to transduce oncogenic signaling through the Ras/Raf/MAPK cascade. By 2001, several recent EGFR family-targeted molecular therapies had demonstrated signifi cant clinical effi cacy in cancer including the EGFR-targeted therapies gefi tinib, erlotinib, and cetuximab along with anti-Her2 monoclonal antibody herceptin. Her2 and EGFR are well-established therapeutic cancer targets based on these clinical successes, the prevalence of EGFR family alternations in cancer, and the highly homologous and druggable ATP-binding site shared by EGFR family members. A collaboration of private companies including GlaxoSmithKline launched a large synthetic effort to simultaneously target these two proteins [ 65 -67 ] . Published results of these efforts detail the synthesis, specifi city, and biological activity of several quinazoline or pyridopyrimidine compounds. One initial compound, GW2974, produced tumor stasis given orally at a dose of 30 mg/kg in squamous cell head and neck carcinoma and breast cancer xenografts. A later report found yet another compound, GW572016, to be a potent, reversible inhibitor of EGFR and Her2 even in the presence of excess EGF [ 68 ] .",

Addition of lapatinib to the FOLFOX4 or FOLFIRI chemotherapy regimen was safe [ 95 , 96 ] and is now being explored for effi cacy. Based on the clinically active combination of trastuzumab with capecitabine, studies with this combination were conducted on Her2overexpressing advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients [ 97 , 98 ] . The study found that the time to progression doubled when lapatinib was added to capecitabine without signifi cant additional toxicity. Effi cacy within these Her2 + patients was not limited to a subgroup [ 99 ] , but a separate study found lapatinib to be effective in Her2 + but not EGFR + /Her2infl ammatory breast cancer patients [ 100 ] . This suggests that Her2 inhibition is a key mediator of antitumor effi cacy in this malignancy. However, a higher lapatinib was recently found in preclinical models to have EGFR-independent and Her2-independent effects on death receptor upregulation that enhances effi cacy when combined with TRAIL and TRAILreceptor antibodies that bind to these receptors [ 101 ] . This rationalizes the clinical exploration of higher doses of lapatinib to gain increased effi cacy via off-target mechanisms.",

Addition of lapatinib to tri-weekly paclitaxel as a fi rst-line therapy yielded a signifi cant increase in time to progression of metastatic breast cancer patients that was restricted to the Her2 + patients [ 103 ] . A recent study has also demonstrated the safety and potential effi cacy of combination with weekly paclitaxel [ 104 ] .

            "text": "The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is a complex signaling network that controls cell survival, death, and division in response to a variety of stimuli such as hypoxia and growth factor deprivation. The elucidation of this pathway started in 1975, when rapamycin was fi rst isolated as an antifungal agent from bacteria in a soil sample from the Polynesian island of Rapa Nui, where the compound got its name [ 106 , 107 ] . Follow up studies in rats found that rapamycin was a potent immunosuppressant [ 108 ] but the molecule lost attention in the scientifi c literature. Over a decade later, a highprofi le immunosuppressant macrolide, FK506, was found to inhibit the proliferation of activated T-cells [ 109 ] . The same investigators that reported this observation also noticed structural homology between FK506 and rapamycin, which prompted a comparison study of their effects. Interestingly, rapamycin and FK506 antagonized the biological effects of each other. Experiments with radiolabelled FK506 found that rapamycin could directly compete with FK506 in cells for its undescribed binding target [ 110 ] , which turned out to be FK506 binding protein (FKBP) [ 111 -114 ] . However, the two molecules had different effects on signaling events involved in T-cell activation such as the transcriptional activity of NFAT or induced IL-2 transcription [ 115 ] . The structure of FKBP alone was determined by NMR [ 116 ] and in complex with FK506 by X-ray crystallography [ 117 ] which together revealed a rather unique drug binding site and revealed a strong conformational shift in FK506 and to a lesser extent in FKBP. Rapamycin was later found to bind to the same site but did not demonstrate a signifi cant conformational shift itself (Fig. 38.5 ) [ 118 ] .",

Furthermore, this mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was required for the G1-arrest induced by rapamycin, which had been widely reported [ 110 , 115 , 123 -126 ] . Rapamycin inhibits the function of the Akt-substrate mTOR [ 127 -129 ] , a serine/ threonine kinase that phosphorylates p70 S6K , which mediates growth factor signaling in response to cytokines such as interleukin-2 [ 125 , 130 -132 ] . mTOR was also found to impact EIF4E, a protein that inhibits translation by binding to the 5\u2032 end of mRNA [ 133 -136 ] .

Nucleotide synthesis is a target of several clinically effective chemotherapies such as methotrexate and fl uorouracil. This observation caught the eye of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). NCI experiments and an independent report found rapamycin to have antitumor activity compara-ble to that of cyclophosphamide and 5-FU in several solid malignancies and leukemia [ 138 ] . Other studies supported anticancer activity of rapamycin B-cell lymphoma [ 139 ] , small cell lung cancer (SCLC) [ 140 ] , rhabdomyosarcoma [ 141 ] , melanoma [ 142 ] , and pancreatic cancer [ 143 ] . Rapamycin was also found to inhibit angiogenesis under hypoxia [ 144 ] by causing transcriptional inhibition of VEGF [ 145 ] , a process detailed later in the discussion of bevacizumab. Furthermore, rapamycin sensitized promyelocytic leukemia [ 141 ] and ovarian cancer [ 146 ] cell lines to cisplatin-induced apoptosis and inhibited transformation by PI3K or AKT. However, the clinical trial data generated in early phase trials of rapamycin as an immunosuppressant uncovered a poor pharmacokinetic profi le [ 147 , 148 ] .

Preclinical studies found temsirolimus to have PTENdependent antitumor activity in a number of cancers [ 149 -155 ] and like rapamycin, bound FK506bp and inhibited phosphorylation of S6K and 4EBP-1 [ 156 , 157 ] . Phase I evaluation of temsirolimus found reversible mucositis or skin-related toxicity, no immunosuppressive functions, and that the major metabolite of temsirolimus was rapamycin [ 158 ] . Another study reported a linear correlation of time to progression and p70 S6K kinase activity as measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, thus providing a pharmacody- namic marker [ 159 ] . Temsirolimus had similar toxicities and response rates at a dose of 25, 75, and 250 mg in renal cell carcinoma. A multicenter phase III study in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) demonstrated extended overall survival (OS) and PFS in patients relative to interferon A but found no support for the combination of these therapies [ 160 ] . In parallel with the publication of this study, temsirolimus became the fi rst FDA-approved cancer therapy to explicitly target mTOR and joined sorafenib and sunitinib for the treatment of advanced RCC. A comparison of temsirolimus with other approved therapies for CML as chosen by the investigator found superiority of temsirolimus in terms of improving PFS and OS [ 161 ] . Combinations with anti-angiogenic therapies such as sorafenib, sunitinib, and bevacizumab have yielded additional toxicity and largely no benefi t [ 162 -164 ] . Temsirolimus anticancer activity is also being clinically explored in breast cancer [ 165 ] , gynecological malignancies [ 166 ] , multiple myeloma [ 167 ] , glioma [ 168 -170 ] , small cell lung cancer [ 171 ] , and neuroendocrine carcinomas.",

Unlike temsirolimus, everolimus retains the immunosuppressive properties of rapamycin and was approved in 2010 for organ rejection prophylaxis. Clinical trials found oral everolimus to be safe at an oral dose of 10 mg/kg [ 172 -175 ] . A phase III study in metastatic (RCC) patients who had failed sorafenib, sunitinib, or the combination demonstrated an increased PFS with everolimus [ 176 ] . This resulted in FDA-approval of everolimus in 2009 for this indication. Based on promising early clinical data, this agent further received accelerated approval in 2010 for subependymal giant-cell astrocytoma patients with tuberous sclerosis who are not eligible for surgery [ 177 ] . Everolimus has promising preliminary effi cacy in Hodgkin's lymphoma [ 178 ] , metastatic gastric cancer [ 179 ] , refractory NSCLC in combination with docetaxel [ 180 ] or gefi tinib, and in breast cancer as a monotherapy [ 181 ] or in combination with letrozole [ 182 , 183 ] or trastuzumab [ 184 ] . Interestingly, a phase II study with everolimus in refractory CLL reported partial responses along with an unexpected increase in the absolute lymphocytic count [ 185 ] . This has important implications for therapeutic sensitization as these cancer cells are likely to be more sensitive intravenous therapies when in circulation rather than in situ, however there is no clinical data to support this. Everolimus along with best supportive care was recently found to double PFS in patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors [ 186 , 187 ] . Ridaforolimus is in earlier clinical development but has demonstrated some partial responses and acceptable toxicity profi les in as a monotherapy [ 188 -190 ] and in combination with capecitabine [ 191 ] and paclitaxel [ 192 ] in solid and hematological malignancies.",

As the development of these rapalogues has happened in a relatively short time span, one is left wondering if these therapies have the same clinical effi cacy. This is a diffi culty inherent in the drug development process as clinical trial design dictates combinations with approved therapies. Combined with confl icting private interests, discerning the effi cacy and unique roles of competing therapies with a similar mechanism of action is challenging. A recent phase II study in advanced pancreatic cancer attempted to compare temsirolimus and everolimus but toxicity and lack of objective response in any treatment group confounded this comparison [ 193 ] . Nevertheless, the discovery and development of rapamycin and rapalogues has extended the life of numerous cancer patients across several malignancies, prevent transplanted rejections, and elucidated a critical cell signaling pathway. At a conceptual level, the rapamycin story highlights the ability of existing therapies to be applied to other medicinal situations, the insight that can be gleaned from mechanistic studies of pharmaceuticals, and the power of medicinal chemistry.",

            "text": "Raf is a serine/threonine kinase that is the apical member of the MAPK signaling cascade, which mediates a variety of cellular processes such as cell death, proliferation, and differentiation in response to extracellular stimuli. Aberrant Raf is observed in about 30 % of human cancers and correlates with the progression of prostate cancer to androgen insensitivity [ 194 ] . This increased signaling can result from alterations in upstream members such as Ras or in one of the three isoforms of Raf1 (A-Raf, B-Raf, and C-Raf). The V600E mutation in B-Raf is seen commonly in melanoma and NSCLC [ 195 ] . C-Raf overexpression has been noted in hepatocellular carcinoma [ 196 ] and validated in preclinical models as a potent drug target for ovarian cancer [ 197 ] . Earlier reports found direct evidence for Raf in determining tumorigenicity and sensitivity to radiation that posed Raf as a drug target [ 198 , 199 ] . Bayer Pharmaceutical and Onyx Pharmaceutical jointly performed a high-throughput screen for Raf1 inhibitors. The screen found 3-thienyl as a lead compound with a Raf1 IC 50 of 17 \u03bcM and that adding a methyl group at a particular position results in a tenfold decrease in IC 50 . A follow-up screen with a library of analogues yielded 3-amino-isoxazole with an IC 50 of 1.2 \u03bcM [ 200 ] . Substitution of the phenyl group of this compound for a 4-pyridyl moiety lowered the Raf1 IC 50 to 230 nM as well as increased aqueous solubility. This compound was found to be orally active, inhibit signaling downstream of Ras through MEK and ERK, and inhibit cancer cell growth in vitro and in xenografts [ 201 ] . Based on SARs found throughout this process, further chemical modifi cations were explored and ultimately yielded sorafenib with a Raf1 IC 50 of 6 nM (Fig. 38.6 ) [ 202 ] .",

The growth of several xenografts were inhibited by sorafenib though in a few cases, no change in MAPK signaling was detected but was rationalized by its anti-angiogenic effects of VEGFR inhibition [ 203 ] . Crystal structures of wild-type and V600E B-Raf in complex with sorafenib revealed key interactions with residues conserved in c-Raf [ 205 ] . The pyridyl ring occupies the ATP-binding pocket while the trifl uoromethyl phenyl ring occupies a proximal hydrophobic pocket. Interestingly, the nitrogen of the pyridyl group forms a hydrogen bond with B-Raf and rationalizes the potent increase in activity following substitution of the pyridyl group for the phenyl group. The urea group bridging the rings was found to form a hydrogen bond network with protein, explaining its conservation throughout the analogue search and development. In this case, the structural data rationalized the previously found SARs. However, structural data can conversely be used to guide the exploration of analogue and can also potentiate in silico screen that computationally models the binding of a virtual library of ligands to protein structure. It should be noted that crystal structures do not provide a complete platform for computing binding affi nities. While the biophysical details of ligand binding are beyond the scope of this chapter, the affi nity of two molecules is determined by the change in enthalpy and entropy. As crystal structures represent a single average molecular conformation across the crystal lattice, they do not refl ect the motions of the molecule. Therefore crystal structures cannot provide direct entropic information themselves and by extension do not fully represent binding affi nity.",

Several phase I trials found dose-dependent responses with an optimal oral dose of 400 mg [ 206 -208 ] and addition of sorafenib to a variety of standard of care chemotherapy regimens did not increase toxicity profi les [ 209 -214 ] . Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is particularly resistant to the majority of chemotherapies and until 1997 was treated with interferon that causes signifi cant toxicities and limited responses. Due to the poor clinical outcomes with standard of care therapies, preclinical effi cacy of sorafenib, and an encouraging phase I result in a metastatic RCC patient, phase II studies were enriched with RCC patients. This study found a strong response in RCC patients [ 215 , 216 ] and led to a large-scale phase III study that reported a doubled PFS and ~40 % increase in OS [ 216 , 217 ] . These results gained sorafenib FDA-approval at the end of 2005 for RCC. A subset analysis of this phase III trial found similar clinical benefi ts regardless of previous cytokine therapy [ 218 ] and a follow-up >1 year from treatment initiation found sustained effi cacy and a well-tolerated toxicity profi le [ 219 ] . Liver transplant has traditionally been the only treatment option available for hepatocellular carcinoma. However, many patients become ineligible while waiting for the transplant as a result of disease progression. Human xenografts of liver cancer cell lines showed partial tumor regression from sorafenib and inhibition of ERK and EIF4 [ 220 ] . A phase II trial found moderate effi cacy and that time to progression correlated with phospho-ERK levels [ 221 ] . A multicenter phase III trial demonstrated an unprecedented increased OS in HCC and solicited the FDA to extend the indication of sorafenib to unresectable HCC [ 222 ] .",

Antibodies are large proteins used by the immune system to recognize, respond to, and remember foreign biological material. Antibodies contain a region that is highly specifi c for a protein target associated with the biological material known as the hypervariable region (Fv), which allows for a high degree of diversity and specifi city. The constant region (Fc) of the antibody consists of a particular immunoglobulin that determines the class of antibody and ultimately the type of immune response mounted. Several factors including the complexity of these large proteins have curtailed our ability to synthesize these highly specifi c binding molecules. However in 1975, medicine was forever changed by discovery the ability to harness cells to make antibodies [ 258 ] . This process consists of immunizing a mouse with the desired antigen, fusing splenic cells from the immunized mice with mouse myeloma cells using Sendai virus, selecting and growing desired clones. This capability has revolutionized modern medicine and biomedical research by offering an unparalleled ability to recognize any given protein with unparalleled specifi city. Oncogene pathways mediated by soluble or cell-surface proteins naturally lend themselves as cancer therapeutic targets within the reach of antibodies.",

            "text": "CD20 is a B-cell-specifi c cell surface protein and as such, is expressed in B-cell cancers such as Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). While the function of CD20 remains unclear, it is known that the protein is not secreted or cleaved from the cell surface [ 259 ] nor is it internalized following antibody binding [ 260 ] . An early study found that administration of murine anti-CD20 in malignant B-cell lymphomas produced a 90 % reduction of circulating malignant cells within four hours in humans [ 261 ] . Variable regions of the murine antibody were cloned in to an expression vector to allow for an antibody with human constant regions and would later gain the name rituximab [ 262 ] . Rituximab demonstrated a binding affi nity for CD20 of 5 nM and resulted in a near complete depletion of peripheral blood cells and a 40-70 % depletion of B-cells in lymph nodes that began recovery around 2 weeks after administration. How does sticking an antibody to a surface molecule that does not have an obvious functional importance potently inhibit cancer? The currently understood answer is that rituximab induces three modes of cell death mediated by immune and cancer cells (Fig. 38.7 ) . Unlike its murine counterpart, this hybridized antibody bound C1Q in vitro and furthermore induced cell lysis in the presence of serum as a source of complement. C1Q is part of a large protein complex that is found in serum and binds IgG or IgM to trigger a series of intra-complex cleavage events that ultimately form a transmembrane complex, called the membrane attack complex, to induce osmotic lysis of the antigenexpressing cell. This process is known as complimentdependent cytotoxicity (CDC). CDC appears to be a key aspect of the antitumor activity of rituximab as rituximabresistant patient samples were associated with CD59, which negatively regulates this process [ 263 , 264 ] . Restoration of compliment has been shown to reverse resistance in smallscale patient studies [ 265 , 266 ] though this has been challenged in preclinical models [ 267 , 268 ] and follicular NHL [ 269 ] .",

A study in mice showed that blocking these various receptors mediated anti-CD20 mAb-induced B-cell depletion and was isotype-specifi c [ 270 ] . Fc\u03b3R bound to IgG present on the surface of a cell can result in phagocytosis by Complement-dependent cytoxicity (CDC) involves a series conformational changes and cleavage events upon binding IgM or IgG that ultimately leads to the formation of the membrane attack (MAC) which induces osmotic lysis. Induction of apoptosis directly by CD20 also occurs but is less clear in mechanism. effector cells but these events are determined by the affi nity and balance of activating and inhibitory Fc\u03b3R molecules [ 271 -273 ] . Accordingly, a follicular NHL study found significantly higher rituximab responses in patients that harbor the Fc\u03b3R 158V allotype compared to the 158F allotype, which has a relatively weaker affi nity for IgG1 [ 274 ] . Ex vivo studies demonstrated that rituximab causes NK-mediated cell lysis [ 275 -277 ] in a dose-dependent manner that was determined by the Fc\u03b3R allotype [ 275 ] . There is also evidence that CD20 has direct effects. Early studies found that antibodies against CD20 signifi cantly mediated RNA synthesis and cell cycle progression [ 278 -280 ] . More recent evidence has found that cross-linking CD20 with antibodies in some, but not all, B-cell lines causes caspase-mediated, Bcl-2-independent apoptosis, and effects the tyrosine kinases Src, Jnk, and p38 [ 281 -284 ] . The contribution of these different mechanisms appears to be highly context dependent and is likely to be a dynamic process varying between patients or even within a single patient.",

            "text": "A number of recent cancer therapies target the EGFR and its family members by inhibiting the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. An alternative approach is to inhibit EGFR signaling by blocking the extracellular binding of the growth factor through use of antibodies. Cetuximab was FDAapproved for the fi rst-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with irinotecan in 2004, making it the fi rst monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA for this type of cancer. The discovery of cetuximab started with the observation that antibodies secreted from mouse hybridoma cells that target EGF receptors were able to block EGF-induced signaling events and proliferation [ 313 ] . A follow up study found that these antibodies potently inhibited the growth of human cancer cells in a murine xenograft [ 314 ] . Further studies of a particularly potent antibody against EGFR, mab 225, found that it competes directly with EGF-binding [ 315 ] , is internalized after two hours in cells [ 316 ] , blocks EGFR autophosphorylation, induces G1 cell cycle arrest by p27 KIP1 induction [ 317 -319 ] , induces caspase-8-mediated apoptosis [ 320 ] , and preferentially accumulate in EGFR-expressing tumors [ 321 ] . The latter was found using a radiolabeled form of the antibody that was subsequently used for the fi rst clinical trial of mab 225. This trial found mab 225 to be safe in squamous cell lung carcinoma patients and profi led the overall and liver drug uptake, serum clearance, and whole-body clearance as monitored radiographically [ 322 ] . Noninvasive molecular imaging of drugs and therapeutic targets remains an active area of research and informs on the distribution, concentration, and kinetics of therapies, their targets, and/or therapeutic response markers in their clinical setting. As with rituximab, mab 225 was engineered into a chimeric human/mouse antibody. This process retains residues in the binding region (F v ) of the antibody from the mouse and replaces other residues not specifi c for the antigen (F c ) with related human residues. This substitution in the F c region reduces side effects resulting from immune responses to foreign, e.g. mouse, immunoglobulins. The mab 225 chimeric antibody, called cetuximab and marketed as Erbitux, was used for further studies and clinical trials. An early phase II trial with cetuximab in combination with irinotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, demonstrated objective responses in EGFR-expressing solid cancers that had become resistant to fi rst-line therapy consisting of leucovorin, 5-fl uorouracil (5-FU), and irinotecan [ 323 ] . Combining cetuximab with this treatment regimen also proved effective in a fi rst-line therapy setting [ 324 -326 ] and moderate effi cacy as a monotherapy [ 327 -330 ] . Safety and effi cacy was reported with cetuximab in FOLFOX6 [ 331 , 332 ] and FOLFOX4 [ 333 -335 ] treatment regimens which consist of leucovorin, 5-FU, and oxaliplatin. A phase III trial also found cetuximab to be effective as a monotherapy and in combination with irinotecan in irinotecan-refractory, EGFR + colorectal cancer patients [ 329 ] . Based on the rational design and specifi city of cetuximab, most of these clinical trials exclusively included patients that had EGFR-expressing tumors as determined by immunohistochemical assays. Interestingly, the intensity of EGFR express did not correlate to cetuximab clinical response and another trial has shown responses in EGFRcolorectal cancer patients [ 336 ] . This unexpected fi nding underscores the complex nature of therapeutic responses in the clinic and the principle that while rational design has well-evidenced benefi ts, it only allows for hypotheses that ultimately must be tested.",

As required by the drug development process, testing therapies in large-scale clinical trials results in considerable patient diversity. Imagine a clinical trial is conducted to examine the effi cacy of a new cancer therapy in 1000 patients where 500 patients receive FOLFOX4 and 500 patients receive FOLFOX4 plus the new therapy. The results show no benefi t by clinical response or overall survival. However, let us say that ten patients within this group showed a clinical response and improved overall survival due to a unique genetic characteristic. These patients comprise 2 % of the investigational therapy population and therefore will not impact response parameters with any level of statistical signifi cance. Redesigning the clinical trial to include patients that harbor this response-determining characteristic may now show a strong therapeutic benefi t otherwise concluded as ineffective. The obvious challenge in patient stratifi cation in clinical trial design is determining what characteristic(s) confer therapeutic response. Clinical trials are sometimes analyzed retrospectively to fi nd such biomarkers. Some of biomarkers have even been added as stipulations for FDAapproved cancer therapies, cetuximab being no exception.",

            "text": "Cell division is an active energy-dependent process and therefore cancer cells must gain alterations that provide more energy to allow for proliferation. While several mechanisms of harvesting intracellular energy are available, cellular respiration is a mainstay that relies primarily on oxygen. The oxygen source for cells is the blood stream and perhaps it is unsurprising that generation of new blood vessels to supply additional oxygen is seen in tumors. A number of pathways and proteins mediate this process of generating new blood vessels in for tumors, particularly the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family. VEGF is transcriptionally upregulated in a variety of solid tumors particularly in hypoxic regions due to stabilization of the transcription factor HIF1\u03b1 that is stabilized under hypoxia. VEGF has four family members, VEGF-A being the prototypical member and itself has four isoforms as a result of alternative splicing which determines its localization and binding properties. Soluble VEGF can bind to VEGF receptors (VEGFR1, VEGF-R2) and its coreceptors (NRP-1,NRP-2) that are expressed on the surface of endothelial cells. Secretion of VEGF ultimately causes the formation of new blood vessels by endothelial cell recruitment and proliferation. Due to the involvement of VEGF in several disease and disorders such as cancer and macular degeneration, antibodies designed to bind VEGF and thereby prevent cognate receptor binding were generated and fi rst described in 1992 [ 341 ] . A follow up study found that one of these mouse monoclonal antibodies, A4.6.1, had potent antitumor activity in vivo but not in vitro [ 342 ] . Interestingly, xenografts of human cancer cells in mice found that introducing soluble VEGF receptors that bind both human and mouse VEGF was superior to a receptor binding only the human or mouse VEGF [ 343 , 344 ] . Together, these fi ndings indicate that both the tumor and other cells in the tumor microenvironment induce participate in generating a new vasculature system through VEGF. Over the last decade, the tumor microenvironment has increasingly garnered attention as a dynamic and strong infl uence on aspects of tumor biology including therapeutic response, growth rates, and metastasis through a variety of mechanisms.",

This humanized version of A4.6.1, known as bevacizumab, is specifi c for all isoforms of VEGF-A and its cleaved products that result from extracellular proteins such as matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP9) present in the tumor microenvironment. A crystal structure of the antigen-specifi c fragment of bevacizumab bound to VEGF identifi ed a critical residue for binding and specifi city (Fig. 38.8 ) [ 346 ] . Bevacizumab was evaluated for safety in cynomolgus monkeys due to the complete conservation of VEGF isoforms between humans and monkeys [ 347 ] . After several weeks of administration at doses up to 50 mg/kg, adverse effects on ocular, ovarian, and uterine angiogenesis-dependent processes were evident but were dose-dependent and reversible. A phase I clinical trial found no additional toxicity associated with adding bevacizumab to various chemotherapies and a terminal half-life of 2-3 weeks [ 348 , 349 ] .

A phase III trial in metastatic colorectal cancer with bevacizumab plus standard chemotherapy increased overall survival, progression-free survival, and objective response rate [ 355 ] .",

Bevacizumab has now been approved for Her2negative breast cancer, metastatic RCC, NSCLC, glioblastoma, and metastatic colorectal cancer. However, bevacizumab seems continually surrounded by controversy from a variety of perspectives including clinical, economic, and ethical issues. A highly debated meta-analysis of 15 clinical trials with bevacizumab found a signifi cant increase in venous thrombosis [ 357 -361 ] . A separate analysis also found an increased risk of high-grade bleeding [ 362 ] . At the end of 2010, the FDA decided to revoke its approval for bevacizumab in metastatic breast cancer based on the results of three large clinical trials (E2100 [ 363 ] , AVADO, and RIBBON1). These trials found that while PFS was prolonged, this magnitude was variable among trials and lifethreatening adverse events were increased without any change in OS. On the same day, the European Medicines Association decided to maintain its approval in metastatic breast cancer but only in combination with paclitaxel based on the same clinical trials.",

Traditionally, OS has been the key parameter used to decide whether or not a new therapy receives FDA approval. This brings up diffi cult questions. Will the therapy provide a net benefi t to the patient? How do you quantify this? These answers will be unique for every patient as each has a unique situation that determines how benefi t is defi ned. Obviously, most patients want to live longer but quality of life is also a consideration, which raises yet another patient-specifi c question: what is quality of life? Clinically, fewer adverse events and prolonged PFS and OS are quantifi able parameters that may act as a partial surrogate defi nition but this consideration is more complex. For bevacizumab, even this incomplete surrogate defi nition is unclear as both adverse events and prolonged PFS have been reported in multiple large-scale clinical trials and the magnitudes of these are highly variable among these trials. These discrepancies and lack of improvement in OS have led to a range of decisions from removal to full approval by medical agencies across the globe. The U.K. National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) denied the approval of bevacizumab for metastatic breast cancer, citing no evidence in improvement of survival or quality of life.",

This type of consideration is diffi cult to evaluate in early clinical trials typically compare an investigational therapy to other therapies in patients where such data would be excluded. Proper examination of this nuance and its effect on OS is warranted in this case. In summary, bevacizumab signifi cantly extends PFS to varying degrees in several solid cancers, may shrink tumors to allow for resection, does not increase OS, and signifi cantly increases adverse events. Cost is the elephant in the room. The cost of bevacizumab treatment varies by country, about $90,000 per year in United States [ 364 ] . In addition to rejecting bevacizumab for metastatic breast cancer, NICE has also denied its approval in metastatic colorectal cancer and RCC. Cost was clearly an issue in renal cell cancer, as the benefi ts of bevacizumab with interferon was similar to sunitinib, a multi-kinase inhibitor already approved for RCC and available at a much lower cost. The various agencies that make the approval decisions on these therapies explain their decisions on the grounds of clinical parameters but patient and social burdens of treatment cost is clearly an underlying infl uence. Off-label explorations, more clinical trials, and altered clinical trial design are likely to yield more information on the utility of bevacizumab. Nevertheless, this controversial therapy highlights diffi cult questions lurking in the background of the clinical management of cancer: How do we determine quality of life? Should we consider costs in approval decision? What price is too high for a given therapeutic benefi t? How do you weigh concomitant risks and benefi ts?",

Alternatively, caspase-8 can initiate the intrinsic death pathway by cleaving Bid to tBid, which primarily interacts with Bax and Bak at the mitochondrial membrane. This interaction induces oligomerization of Bax and Bak to promote cytochrome c release. In the cytosol, cytochrome c binds to apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) and caspase-9 to form the apoptosome, which initiates the caspase cascade. While TRAIL directly targets death receptors that generally play a tumor suppressor role, several oncoproteins mediate this process and serve as potent resistance mechanisms. One of the most striking examples is Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family that interacts with pro-apoptotic family members such as Bax to inhibit mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis.

As a result, TRAIL-agonist antibodies targeting either of two pro-apoptotic death receptors were created and are currently in clinical trials [ 381 ] . Lexatumumab is one of the most developed DR5 agonist antibodies. A phase I study with lexatumumab in previously treated advanced solid tumors reported a MTD of 10 mg/kg when given once every 21 days, a second-phase serum half-life of ~16 days, and stable disease in approximately a third of the treated patients [ 382 ] . Another phase I study found lexatumumab to be safe at 10 mg/kg once every 14 days [ 383 ] .",

            "text": "We still have not won the war on cancer. However, we have greatly expanded our understanding and gained some highly effective therapies in the course of battle. Cancer was once understood as a simple clonal expansion of a cell that gained a growth advantage by a stepwise loss or gain of function of a few critical genes. This previously linear pathway of carcinogenesis is now a multinodal, interconnected network of events and we have begun to appreciate the immense heterogeneity of tumors and the dynamic parameters that govern their biology and therapeutic response. So how much has all of this research investment helped cancer patients? Clearly some types of cancer have benefi ted from new targeted agents such as NHL and breast cancer. Chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery remain the cornerstones of treatment regimens in many malignancies and none of these were developed with a molecular understanding of their mechanism of action. Serendipity has played a key role in the discovery of many cancer therapies still used today. Nevertheless, it has been our hypotheses and observations built upon our prior knowledge base that has guided the application of these serendipitous discoveries. The discovery of nitrogen mustards was certainly not found in a quest to cure cancer but it was applied to cancer by a hypothesis generated from the current understanding of cancer. It is the application of our knowledge to what is right under our nose that can yield new solutions, quite literally in the case of rapamycin. The more we understand how cancer works, the better we understand what we are looking for and how we can use the tools we already have.",

Considering this multifactorial and complex nature of cancer and the level of effort put forth throughout history to cure it, it is likely that there will be no magic bullet that cures cancer. The future of cancer therapy lies in continued drug discovery, explorations of multimodal and combinatorial therapy, improved agent targeting, and personalized medicine. Combinations of existing therapies can yield antagonistic to synergistic responses in the clinic but is often diffi cult to interpret due to the heterogeneity of patient responses. Interpretation of inter-patient and intra-patient responses will also play a critical role in the future of cancer therapy and could benefi t from the use of biomarkers and molecular imaging. It is important that we understand why a therapy fails in a certain situation so that successful situations can be clearly identifi ed, future failures may be avoided, and other successful treatment options can be discovered.
