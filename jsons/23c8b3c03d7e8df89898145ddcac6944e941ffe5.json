It is therefore important and timely to characterize interactions between the virus and host cell at the molecular level to understand its disease pathogenesis. To gain insights, we performed high-throughput sequencing that generated time-series data simultaneously for bioinformatics analysis of virus genomes and host transcriptomes implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our analysis results showed that the rapid growth of the virus was accompanied by an early intensive response of host genes. We also systematically compared the molecular footprints of the host cells in response to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.",

The SARS-CoV-2 is the third highly pathogenic coronavirus following SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that cause severe accurate respiratory symptoms in humans. Since December 2019, this virus has caused more than 80 thousand COVID-19 cases in China. Nowadays, the number of infections in countries outside China is growing rapidly. The most remarkable feature of the SARS-CoV-2 incidences and epidemiology is its great capacity for human-to-human transmission [1] . Clinically, the majority of COVID-19 patients have mild and moderate symptoms, and the elderly appear to have severe symptoms [2] . Based on the analysis of China data, the COVID-19 case-fatality rate was estimated as around 4.0% (3,341deaths over 82,249 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection) [3] , lower than those of SARS and MERS [4] . However, due to the large-scale infected population, the SARS-CoV-2 has already caused more than ninety thousand deaths as of April 11 th 2020, sowing great social panic around the world.",

Generally, once the virus enters the cell, the host innate immune responses, such as the interferon-mediated antiviral responses and cytokine production, have a pivotal role in suppressing the virus replication, which, if inadequate, might contribute to the viral pathogenesis. This hypothesis has been supported by our previous study, which has shown that the high pathogenicity of avian influenza virus is associated with abnormal coordination between interferon-mediated antiviral responses and cytokine production in host cells [7] . Similar to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which induce the overactivation of cytokines [8] , increased cytokine levels are also observed in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 [9] . Transcriptome analysis of in vitro host cells shows that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV elicit distinct responses to the expression of the host genes [10] . Until now, the time-series gene-expression profiling of the host response to SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown and thus is urgently needed uncovering its pathogenesis.",

For the three cell entry related genes (ACE2 as the receptor of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [28, 29] , DPP4 as the receptor of MERS-CoV [30] and protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming of SARS-CoV-2 [27] ), we observed the dramatic changes in TMPRSS2 expression with very early induction during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the slightly down-regulated expression of ACE2 in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, whereas DPP4 was more up-regulated in MERS-CoV (Figure 4 ). For the two PRRs, DDX58 is a canonical RIG-I-like receptor for RNA virus recognition [31] , and TLR3 is a Toll-like receptor playing important roles in initiating a protective innate immune response to highly pathogenic coronavirus infections [32] . We observed that all three viruses had a notably up-regulated expression of DDX58 while only MERS-CoV had a suppressed TLR3 at the 24 hpi (Figure 4) , which is consistent with the fact that decreased expression of TLR3 contributes to the pathology of highly pathogenic coronavirus infections [32] . Among the four regulator genes, IRF7 is responsible for the expression of most IFN-\u03b1 subtypes and the type I IFN amplification loop [33] , and IRF9, STAT1 and STAT2 form the ISGF3 complex that binds to interferon-stimulated response elements and thereby induces the expression of interferon-stimulated genes [34] . As expected, gradually up-regulation of the four primary regulator genes was observed for all three viruses (Figure 4 ). At last, we found a significant difference in the expression of IFNB1 between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, indicating that IFNB1 likely accounted for the observed variations of the host antiviral capacities among three viruses (Figure 4) . Taken together, early induction of TMPRSS2 and gradually increased expression level of IFNB1 were likely responsible for the distinct host immune response patterns of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

To summarize, our findings showed that SARS-CoV-2 induced the significantly high expression of the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 at 0 hpi to help the entry of viral particles into cells [28] (Figure 4 ). At the same time, host cell initiated an immediate response for the invasion of SARS-CoV-2 virus ( Figure 1D ). Then, the virus successfully suppressed the acute response of host cells for fast proliferation by increasing the transcripts of its 3' genome end, including M, 6, 7a, 7b, 8 and N genes which were consistent with their reported regulations to host immune response [18, 19] . As a response from hosts cell, a number of antiviral pathways and cytokine productions were up-regulated to resist the virus infection (Figures 2 and 3 ). In particular, several metabolism-associated pathways were down-regulated at 12hpi and 24 hpi (Figure 2 ). After the antagonistic cycle, a dramatic proliferation of viral particles was detected in the early infection of host cells ( Figure 1B) , which could possibly be an explanation for the fast spread of SARS-CoV-2 in humans.",

[5] have published transcriptome data of host responses to SARS-CoV-2 from in vitro cell lines including A549 (MOI of 0.2) and NHBE (MOI of 2) at 24 hpi. This previously published data is complemented by our study designed to investigate the early response phase of cell lines infected with SARS-CoV-2. While the previous work did not observe the elevated levels of IFNB1, IFNL1 and IFNL3, our findings show that not only IFNB1 but also IFNL1 and IFNL3 expressions are upregulated between 7 and 24 hpi ( Figure 3D ). Also, they did not detect gene expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 at 24 hpi, while we observed that ACE2 is down-regulated at 24 hpi and TMPRSS2 is only up-regulated at 0 hpi before returning to the normal levels ( Figure 4) . Our time-series sampling revealed distinct early-response features of SARS-CoV-2, which provided a possible explanation for some clinical observations. For example, a recent clinical study [35] found that SARS-CoV-2 could replicate effectively in upper respiratory tract tissues, and that the viral loads appeared earlier (before day 5) and were substantially more than expected. Findings from the present study have confirmed that, at 7 hpi, the 3' end of SARS-CoV-2 genome start to express densely, reducing the effectiveness of host immune surveillance, which possibly enables the rapid replication of SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory tract tissues.",

Most importantly, most of DEGs at 0 hpi were suppressed at 7 hpi, which simultaneously occurred with active transcription of the 3' end of SARS-CoV-2 genome, demonstrating the critical role of the 3' end in antagonizing host immune response. The suppression of host responses were not likely due to sequencing bias because the three samples from the infected group at 7 hpi were clustered with mock samples (Figure 1A). Interestingly, there seem to be some correlated between the decrease in the levels of the host transcriptome (compared to the total RNA level of SARS-CoV-2) and the relative number of up-regulated genes (compared to downregulated genes) (SupplementaryFigure 1). This may indicate the complex molecular behavior of the host cell in response to the virus infection.",

For SARS-CoV-2, 710 DEGs (498 up-regulated and 212 down-regulated) were immediately induced at the very early stage (0 hpi), and many more DEGs were gradually observed at the late stages (12 and 24 hpi). In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infected cells exhibited far fewer DEGs (0, 4 and 3 for SARS-CoV and 0, 6 and 54 for MERS-CoV) at the early stages (0, 7 and 12 hpi). However, more DEGs were clearly detected at 24 hpi during SARS-CoV and especially MERS-CoV infection (268 and 4302 respectively). This distinct DEG patterns indicated that SARS-CoV-2 actually induced earlier host responses compared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. To further delineate differential perturbation of pathways among three viruses, we conducted GO-enrichment analysis based on their respective DEGs. Overall, substantially enriched pathways, such as inflammation, apoptosis, antiviral response, transcription, translation and mitochondrion-related pathways, were detected at various time points during SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 3). At 0 hpi, the up-regulated DEGs were mostly enriched in the pathways related to inflammation-related pathways including the NF-kB signaling and cytokine-mediated signaling pathways, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 could induce inflammatory responses at the very early stage of infection. At the same time, SARS-CoV-2 also triggered the cellular apoptosis signaling pathway, implying that early onset cell death happened along with inflammation response. Beginning at 7 hpi, our results showed a significant enrichment in antivirus response-related pathways until 24 hpi (Figure 2). At the late stages (12 and 24 hpi), down-regulated DEGs were exclusively enriched in fundamental host pathways responsible for RNA processing and transcription, protein translation and mitochondrial activity (Figure 2). Different from SARS-CoV-2, at the late stage of SARS-CoV infection (24 hpi), the highly enriched genes were identified to be involved in antivirus-related pathways, whereas no significantly enriched pathways were found for MERS-CoV infection despite numerous DEGs existing at 24 hpi (Figure 2). Taken together, the above results indicated that the etiology mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 was different from that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as implicated by the overall differential patterns of the host response against infection.Quantification of the capacity for host antiviral immunity and cytokine production for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infectionsAs mentioned above, SRAR-CoV-2 induced specific patterns of host antiviral and inflammation responses compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. To quantify host antiviral capacity and inflammation responses during infection of the three viruses, two sets of genes were used as their indicators. First, we used a set of 45 early induced genes in interferon-\uf061 treated Calu-3 cell [7] as antiviral indicators to quantify the level of host antiviral capacity against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. Our analysis showed that, the antiviral capacity of the host against SARS-CoV-2 was gradually increased over the time course of infection (Figure 3A). In contrast, the host antiviral capacities against both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were nearly zero at least during the initial stages of infection (between 0h and 12 hpi), followed by a marginal increase at 24 hpi. The antiviral capacity in SARS-CoV and especially MERS-CoV infected cells were much lower than that in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, which might underpin the disparity in mortality between the three viruses. Despite the observation of the potent early-induced host antiviral activity during SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection, our results clearly showed that most of the genes (25/45) were significantly induced among infections of the three viruses (",

            "text": "). Unlike the other two viruses, MERS-CoV specifically induced the expression of dozens of cytokines, such as LTA, IL19, CXCL13 and CCL3, at 24 hpi, which were not observed in the case of the other two viruses. Interestingly, among the 28 up-regulated cytokines at the very early stage (0 hpi) during SARS-CoV-2 infection, eight cytokines including IL-6 (IL6), IL-1b (IL1B), IL-8 (CXCL8), G-CSF (CSF3), GM-CSF (CSF2), IP10 (CXCL10), MCP1 (CCL2) and TNF were reported to exhibit substantially elevated serum levels [9, 26, 27], which indicated that early induction of cytokines played critical roles in the pathology of SARS-CoV-2. While most of the eight cytokines were moderately up-regulated at the late stage during SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, up-regulation were not observed at the early stage. Collectively, SARS-CoV-2 induced distinct patterns of host antiviral response and cytokine production.",

Secondly, expressions of the 6800 DEGs were distributed over the four time points from low to high, not only in SARS-CoV-2 but also in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Supplementary Figures 2 and 3), indicating that the silent early host responses to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV appeared not to be due to technological biases. Lastly, when extending the infection time from 24 hpi to 72hpi (GSE33267), thousands of DEGs (minimum 1022 and maximum 2017 genes) , which had been inhibited at the early stages, were actually induced (SupplementaryFigure 4).",
