However, these antibodies, intended to protect the host, may sometimes prove beneficial to the virus, by facilitating viral entry and replication in the target cell. This phenomenon, known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, is a result of interaction of virus-antibody immune complexes with Fc\u03b3 and/or complement receptors on certain types of host cells and promotes viral entry into the host cells. The internalized immune complexes then modulate host immune response so as to enhance viral replication and aggravate disease severity.

            "text": "Antibodies are an important component of the host adaptive immune response against infecting virus. Virus neutralization is considered to be the key mechanism of antibody-mediated protection. The antiviral activity of antibody is further augmented by Fc-mediated effector mechanisms such as complement-mediated lysis of viral particles, phagocytosis, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Braciale et al. 2013) . Neutralization occurs when antibody molecule(s) bind to the virus particle at its surface epitope and block viral attachment (to cellular receptor) and entry into host cell, and/or post-entry processes such as fusion and uncoating, thus resulting in loss of virion infectivity ( Fig. 2.1 ). Two models have been proposed to describe the kinetics of neutralization. According to the single-hit model, binding of a single antibody molecule to a critical site on the virion is sufficient for neutralization. The more accepted multi-hit model postulates that neutralization can be achieved only when the virion is bound by multiple antibodies, exceeding the stoichiometric threshold of neutralization (Klasse and Sattentau 2002) . The potency of neutralization is determined by the affinity of antibody binding and accessibility of the neutralization epitope(s) on the viral surface (Dowd et al. 2011 ).",

            "text": "The phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) was discovered in flaviviruses during the 1960s-1970s. While observational studies on dengue virus (DENV) infections revealed a significant association between severe illness and antibody responses in secondary infection (Halstead et al. 1967) , in vitro experiments demonstrated increased infectivity of Murray Valley encephalitis virus (Hawkes 1964; Hawkes and Lafferty 1967) and DENV (Halstead et al. 1973a) in the presence of antibody. In vivo studies in rhesus monkeys showing association of antibody response with higher dengue viremia offered further supportive evidence for this phenomenon (Halstead et al. 1973b; Halstead 1979; Marchette et al. 1973) . ADE ensues when antibodies binding to the virus particle fail to efficiently neutralize the virus (Halstead 2003; Taylor et al. 2015) . This may occur due to the nonneutralizing nature of the antibody (binding to viral epitopes other than those involved in cell attachment and entry) or the presence of sub-neutralizing concentrations of antibodies (binding to viral epitopes below the threshold for neutralization). Either way, these antibodies aid entry of the virus into target cells, resulting in enhancement of viral infection, known as antibody-dependent enhancement ( Fig. 2.1.) . The mechanism of ADE involves internalization of virus-antibody immune complexes into cells via interaction of the antibody Fc region with the cellular Fc receptors (FcRs). Consequently, FcR-bearing myeloid cells such as monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and certain granulocytes are permissive to ADE of infection, through phagocytic uptake of the immune complexes. Such ADE is principally mediated by IgG antibodies, however, IgM along with complement, and IgA antibodies have also been shown to be capable of ADE (Hawkes and Lafferty 1967; Cardosa et al. 1983; Janoff et al. 1995; Kozlowski et al. 1995) .",

This mechanism is termed as \"intrinsic ADE\" and has been subsequently observed in flaviviruses as well (Chareonsirisuthigul et al. 2007; Ubol et al. 2010) . Thus, ADE is a complex phenomenon comprising of extrinsic and intrinsic components, which together contribute to augmentation of viral infection and replication. The consequence of this increased virus production is the massive release of inflammatory and vasoactive mediators by host cells, which ultimately leads to exacerbation of viral pathogenesis and disease severity.",

This phenomenon is thus widely observed during secondary infection with a heterotypic virus of the same genus, wherein preexisting antibodies against the primary (sensitizing) infection bind to the (secondary) virus, but fail to neutralize it. The pathogenicity and outcome of secondary infection is influenced by the time interval between primary/secondary infections, with increasing time being associated with more severe disease, and may be explained by the waning of broadly neutralizing antibodies over time. Passively acquired antibodies are also capable of inducing ADE, as indicated by the enhancement of viral disease by preexisting maternal antibody in infants born to dengue-immune mothers (Kliks et al. 1988; Chau et al. 2008 Chau et al. , 2009 .",

            "text": "Dengue virus (DENV) is a member of family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, and is transmitted to humans through the bite of Aedes mosquitoes, mainly Aedes aegypti. Infection with any of the four serotypes of this virus, DENV-1 to DENV-4, may be asymptomatic, or lead to dengue fever with symptoms ranging from mild to highdegree fever with headache, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, and retro-orbital pain. In some patients, the illness may progress to life-threatening severe dengue [earlier classified as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)/dengue shock syndrome (DSS)], characterized by increased vascular permeability, plasma leakage, extensive pleural effusion, severe hemorrhages, respiratory distress, and organ failure (WHO 2009 ). Dengue disease is endemic in more than 125 countries and is considered a major public health problem worldwide, with an estimated 96 million cases and 20,000 deaths reported annually (Bhatt et al. 2013 ). In the absence of effective antivirals, dengue treatment mainly relies on symptomatic interventions. Though a licensed vaccine is now available, implementation of mass immunization programs remains complicated due to ADE, and is discussed in later sections. The DENV genome is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA molecule (~11 kb in size) and contains a single open reading frame coding for a large polyprotein, which is subsequently processed into three structural proteins, capsid (C), membrane (M), and envelope (E), and at least seven nonstructural proteins, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5 (Lindenbach et al. 2013) . The E glycoprotein is the major surface-exposed region of the virus and displays the viral antigenic determinants. It functions to bind cellular receptors and fuse with host cell membranes during virus penetration and also directs viral assembly and budding. The E protein monomer can be divided into three structural/functional domains-EDI, the central region; EDII, the site of fusion; and EDIII, the site of receptor binding (Modis et al. 2004) . The M protein is initially expressed as a membrane precursor (prM), which is present in the intracellular immature virus particle. Virion assembly and maturation involves cleavage of the precursor (pr) peptide, resulting in release of the mature virus particle containing the M protein into the extracellular environment (Li et al. 2008; Junjhon et al. 2010 ).",

            "text": "The possibility of immune enhancement of DENV infection was first suggested by observation of strong association of severe disease (DHF/DSS) with secondary infection among dengue patients in Bangkok, Thailand, during 1962 -1964 (Halstead et al. 1967 Guzman et al. 2013 ). These initial findings were supported by prospective sero-epidemiological studies showing a higher rate of DHF/DSS during secondary infections (Sangkawibha et al. 1984; Graham et al. 1999; Halstead 2008) . The association of secondary heterotypic DENV (different serotype) infection with ADE and severe dengue was further strengthened by reports of DHF/DSS cases in Cuba during the 1981/1997 DENV-2 outbreaks and 2001-2002 DENV 3 outbreak in a population immune to DENV-1 (1981 DENV-1 ( /1997 ) and DENV-1/2 (2001-02), respectively (Guzman et al. 1990 (Guzman et al. , 2000 Alvarez et al. 2006 ). Further, it has been demonstrated that such secondary DHF/DSS cases have higher viremia and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that greater infected cell mass and subsequent increase in cytokine release contribute to disease severity in these patients (Vaughn et al. 2000; Wang et al. 2006; Rothman 2011) . However, interestingly, tertiary/quaternary DENV infections have been rarely associated with severe disease, presumably due to sufficient cross-protective immunity acquired after two (primary/secondary) different DENV infections (Gibbons et al. 2007 ). The most compelling evidence for ADE is provided by observation of severe dengue during primary infection in infants born to dengue-immune mothers (Kliks et al. 1988; Chau et al. 2008 Chau et al. , 2009 . During the first 3-4 months after birth, passively acquired maternal antibodies have been shown to protect infants from symptomatic dengue. Thereafter, the maternal antibodies begin to decline and reach sub-neutralizing levels, at which the antibodies are capable of enhancing DENV infection. Such enhancing antibodies persist till ~12 months of age, placing the infants at increased risk of severe dengue. Indeed, this enhancing activity of the infant sera has been demonstrated in vitro.",

Such protective antibodies represent only a small subset of the antibody repertoire in dengue patients, with the immune response being dominated by cross-reactive, non-neutralizing antibodies targeting EDI, EDII (fusion loop) and prM, which have the potential to enhance viral infection (Smith et al. 2014) .

The prM protein, present in the intracellular immature virus particle, covers the fusion domain of the E protein, thus preventing its fusion with the host cell membrane. Cleavage of the precursor (pr) peptide from the prM protein during the process of virus maturation renders the released mature virus particle \"infectious\" to host cells for further rounds of replication (Li et al. 2008; Junjhon et al. 2010) . Inefficient processing of the prM protein results in the production of immature or partially immature virus particles, which are normally noninfectious due to their inability to fuse with host cell. However, studies using human monoclonal antibodies obtained from persons with secondary dengue have revealed that these immature virus particles are capable of infecting host cells in the presence of the nonneutralizing anti-prM antibodies, and are thus infectious during secondary infections with the possibility of contributing to severe disease (Dejnirattisai et al. 2010; Schmidt 2010) . Similarly, antibodies specific to the fusion loop (FL) in EDII have also been shown to enhance the infectivity of immature DENV particles (Rodenhuis-Zybert et al. 2011).",

            "text": "The Fc\u03b3 receptors (Fc\u03b3Rs) present on the surface of cells of the myeloid lineage function to internalize antibody-opsonized virus via receptor-mediated endocytosis or phagocytosis and thus aid in clearance of the virus from blood circulation. However, these Fc\u03b3Rs can also contribute to ADE of DENV infection, by offering the virus an alternative pathway of entry into its target cells, the Fc\u03b3R-bearing monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (Taylor et al. 2015; Gan et al. 2017 ). There are three classes of human Fc\u03b3Rs, namely, Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RII, and Fc\u03b3RIII. Fc\u03b3RI is a high-affinity activating receptor that can bind to monomeric IgG molecules (Vogelpoel et al. 2015) . Fc\u03b3RII is a class of low-affinity receptors that require high avidity binding by IgG immune complexes. Of these, Fc\u03b3RIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIC are activating receptors, while Fc\u03b3RIIB is an inhibitory receptor (Guilliams et al. 2014 ). The activating receptors are involved in intracellular signal transduction via the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), either accessory (for Fc\u03b3RI) or present within the receptor cytoplasmic domain (for Fc\u03b3RIIA), while the inhibitory receptor contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain (Boonnak et al. 2013) . Activating receptors efficiently internalize antibody-opsonized virus, and can be involved in neutralization or enhancement, depending on the antibody concentration and receptor properties. Fc\u03b3RI being a high-affinity receptor requires significantly less antibody for complete neutralization and thus plays a predominant role in DENV neutralization (Chawla et al. 2013) . In contrast, Fc\u03b3RIIA has been shown to be an effective mediator of ADE, with its ITAM-containing cytoplasmic tail playing a crucial role (Boonnak et al. 2013) .",

In macrophage-like P388D1 cells, antibody-opsonized virus is shown to be internalized by phagocytic uptake facilitated by actin-mediated membrane protrusions which actively search and capture the antibody-bound virus particles, possible by chemotaxis (Ayala-Nunez et al. 2016) .",

Inhibition of this Fc\u03b3R-dependent ISG transcription is thus crucial for successful DENV replication and is proposed to be brought about by co-ligation of LILR-B1 by the Fc\u03b3R-bound antibody-opsonized DENV (Chan et al. 2014; Nimmerjahn and Lux 2014) . LILR-B1 belongs to a family of ITIM-containing inhibitory receptors and is expressed on immune effector cells including monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. At sub-neutralizing antibody concentrations, the DENV-antibody immune complex binds to two cellular receptors: Fc\u03b3R (through antibody) and LILR-B1 (through DENV E protein). Binding to LILR-B1 recruits Src homology phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) which dephosphorylates and inactivates Syk and prevents ISG expression. SHP-1 signaling also prevents rapid acidification and lysosomal degradation of DENV (Ong et al. 2017 ). On the contrary, at high antibody concentrations, DENV E protein epitopes are completely blocked by the antibody; consequently, LILR-B1 binding is not possible, resulting in neutralization of the Fc\u03b3R-internalized virus.",

IL-10 induction during DENV-ADE thus exerts an immunosuppressive effect and favors viral replication. Indeed, high IL-10 levels have been associated with severe disease in secondary dengue patients Ubol et al. 2010) . The mechanism of IL-10-mediated immune suppression has been demonstrated through in vitro studies in monocytic cell lines and patient PBMCs. These studies have shown that IL-10 induction during ADE occurs through enhanced Syk-regulated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB)/glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3\u03b2/cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding (CREB) signaling (Tsai et al. 2014 ). IL-10 then stimulates expression of SOCS3, which subsequently inactivates Janus kinase (Jak)-STAT signaling, resulting in suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. In addition, IL-10 also suppresses inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression and thus nitric oxide production, by inhibiting STAT-1 and Interferon Regulatory Factor 1 (IRF-1) activity (Chareonsirisuthigul et al. 2007; Ubol et al. 2010) .",

ADE of DENV infection and replication results in increased presentation of viral antigens on the surface of infected cells, leading to activation and proliferation of T cells sensitized during a prior infection. This results in release of cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, IL-6, IL1-\u03b2, IL-8 and immunoregulators such as IL-12p70, which directly act upon the vascular endothelial cells resulting in plasma leakage, the hallmark of severe dengue.

These trials had demonstrated high vaccine efficacy among 9-16-year-olds during the first 2 years after vaccine (first of three doses) administration, but indicated increased risk of hospitalized dengue in the 2-5 year age group during the third year of follow-up. These results suggested the possibility of the vaccine sensitizing dengue seronegatives to subsequent enhanced DENV infection and disease. However, considering the population-level benefits in reducing disease burden, the vaccine was approved by WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on immunization, with recommendations for use in dengue-endemic regions with \u226570% seroprevalence and administration to individuals in the age range of 9-45 years. This approval was followed by additional studies to investigate the long-term benefitrisk ratio of dengue vaccination in seronegative population. These studies revealed that vaccine performance was indeed affected by serostatus, with vaccine efficacy being significantly higher in seropositives than seronegatives. Furthermore, an increased risk of hospitalized, severe dengue was observed among seronegative vaccine recipients as compared to seronegative controls (Sridhar et al. 2018) . In light of this new evidence regarding vaccine-related ADE, WHO-SAGE issued updated recommendations on the use of CYD-TDV vaccine in April 2018 (Wilder-Smith et al. 2019) . For countries considering vaccination as part of their dengue control program, WHO now recommends a \"pre-vaccination screening strategy,\" in which all potential vaccine recipients are tested for anti-DENV IgG, preferably by ELISA, and only dengue-seropositive persons are vaccinated. Further, for trials of new vaccines, WHO advises stratification of participants according to pre-vaccination serostatus during data analysis, as well as long-term follow-up of all vaccine recipients.",

DENV EDIII induces predominantly neutralizing antibodies, thus making recombinant EDIII an attractive subunit vaccine candidate (Gil et al. 2017; Frei et al. 2018) . DENV NS1 has also been considered as a vaccine candidate as it avoids ADE (Hertz et al. 2017) . Chimeric DENV constructs with pr gene replaced with Japanese Encephalitis virus pr and DNA vaccines with substitutions or removal of enhancing epitopes have demonstrated reduction in ADE (Crill et al. 2012; Tang et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2015) . Another strategy for evasion of ADE is the development of vaccine candidates inducing protective CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. DENV C protein is an immunodominant T-cell epitope, and C-based vaccines have shown induction of protective T-cell-mediated immunity in monkeys (Gil et al. 2014) . Such next-generation vaccines do face the disadvantage of not retaining the intact virion structure and the quaternary epitopes, which are important for potent neutralization. However, these vaccines have shown encouraging results in preclinical studies, and whether they are capable of conferring in vivo protection remains to be seen.",

The final stage of HIV infection is acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), characterized by immune system failure and occurrence of life-threatening opportunistic infections. As of 2016, ~37 million people worldwide have been estimated to be living with HIV (Ghosn et al. 2018) .

Through either of these mechanisms, virus-specific antibodies present in sera of HIV-infected individuals were shown to enhance viral entry and in some cases replication within T cells, monocytes/macrophages, and granulocytic cells (Beck et al. 2008) . Further, both these mechanisms have also been shown to enhance HIV infection of human syncytiotrophoblast cells, thus suggesting contribution of ADE to materno-fetal transmission (T\u00f3th et al. 1994) . Both these forms of ADE are mediated by antibodies targeting the viral surface glycoproteins gp41 and gp120 (Trischmann et al. 1995; . Such enhancing antibodies have been detected in 72% of HIV patients (Subbramanian et al. 2002) . C-ADE of HIV infection has been well characterized through in vitro studies in T-cell lines such as MT-2 and SupT1/R5, showing enhancement of cell line-adapted HIV strains or primary virus isolates by human monoclonal antibodies or sera from HIV-infected individuals, and has been associated with increased synthesis of viral RNA and protein and enhanced release of infectious virions (Robinson Jr. et al. 1989 , 1990a Robinson Jr. 2006; Willey et al. 2011 ). Such C-ADE is primarily mediated by antibodies targeting the N-terminal immunodominant domain of viral gp41. Antibody binding to gp41 initiates the complement cascade leading to deposition of complement component C3d,g on the virion. Interaction of this opsonized virus with the cell surface complement receptor type 2 (CR2) facilitates virus attachment and internalization. Engagement of the HIV receptor CD4 and coreceptor CXCR4 is also required for this mode of virus uptake. Increased attachment of the virus to target cell, rather than CR2-mediated signaling, has been suggested to be responsible for enhancement of infection through C-ADE. An alternative route of complement component C1q binding followed by interaction with C1q receptor has also been suggested for C-ADE (Prohaszka et al. 1997) .",

ADE by Fc\u03b3RI and Fc\u03b3RII requires viral interaction with CD4, indicating that the FcRs facilitate virus entry by potentiating attachment to CD4 receptors. Alternatively, FcRmediated endocytosis of virus-antibody complexes followed by intracellular fusion with endosomal membrane occurring as a result of binding of virus with CD4 receptors on the endosomal membranes has also been suggested. Fc\u03b3RIII-mediated ADE has been shown to be CD4-independent.

These studies have observed strong negative correlation between the extent of ADE and CD4 cell count and positive correlation between ADE and plasma viral load in HIV-positive individuals. As CD4 cell count and HIV plasma viral load are considered the most potent predictors of HIV disease progression, such observations indicate contribution of ADE to accelerated immunosuppression and disease progression. Further support for this association was provided by reports of decline in enhancing antibody levels and improvement in disease prognosis in patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) (Banhegyi et al. 2003) . Contradictory observations of absence of any clinical correlation between ADE and disease have also been reported (Montefiori et al. 1991) ; however, it has been suggested to be the result of conduction of experiments in conditions which do not sufficiently resemble in vivo conditions Beck et al. 2008 ).",

Studies in Rhesus monkeys have demonstrated the association of active and passive immunization with enhanced disease progression on subsequent infection (Staprans et al. 2004; Sholukh et al. 2014) . In humans, ADE has been indicated in two vaccine clinical trials. In the AIDSVAX trial, the rate of HIV infection was observed to be higher among vaccinees with low (non-protective) antibody responses (Gilbert et al. 2005) . In the RV144 trial, positive correlation of vaccine-elicited plasma IgA responses with risk for HIV acquisition was documented (Shmelkov et al. 2014 ). Further, a study investigating the effect of passive immunization of HIV-positive pregnant women on mother-to-infant transmission suggested the possibility of antibody-enhanced in utero transmission (Onyango-Makumbi et al. 2011) . These findings are suggestive of vaccine-induced ADE, but cannot confirm the same. Assays capable of estimating neutralizing and enhancing potential of immune serum, such as those involving use of complement and complement receptor carrying target cells for C-ADE, have been proposed for a better understanding of the clinical relevance of vaccine-related ADE. Such assays would also provide stronger immune correlates during preclinical and clinical studies. Further, design of vaccine immunogens that will elicit protective and not enhancing antibodies, by avoiding inclusion of known enhancing epitopes, has been put forth as a mitigation strategy for HIV-ADE (Beck et al. 2008 ).",

            "text": "Influenza is a highly communicable acute respiratory disease caused by infection with influenza virus of family Orthomyxoviridae. The disease is a serious health threat of epidemic and pandemic proportions, with severe cases associated with pneumonia and lung tissue damage. Influenza A viruses are the most common in human infections and are further classified into subtypes on the basis of the two surface proteins, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), with 18 H and 11 N subtypes identified (Shao et al. 2017) . Influenza A virus undergoes rapid evolution due to mechanisms such as antigenic drift, shift, and genetic reassortment, resulting in periodic emergence of novel viral strains. Annual vaccination against the circulating viral strain is thus implemented for protection against the disease. Epithelial cells of the respiratory tract are the primary targets of influenza virus infection; however, in vitro ADE of this virus has been reported in primary macrophages and macrophage-like cell lines (P388D1), under the presence of monoclonal antibodies, mice, rabbit, or human immune sera (Ochiai et al. 1988 (Ochiai et al. , 1990 (Ochiai et al. , 1992 Tamura et al. 1991 Tamura et al. , 1994 Gotoff et al. 1994) . Engagement of Fc\u03b3Rs by antibodies specific to viral HA and NA has been shown to mediate virus uptake, with subtype cross-reactive non-neutralizing antibodies being particularly involved in infection enhancement of heterotypic viruses (different HA/NA type). While such internalization usually results in abortive infection of macrophages, productive replication in these cells has been shown to be possible in the presence of appropriate protease for HA cleavage. Increased presentation of viral antigens by the infected macrophages leading to augmented virus-specific T-cell activation is also suggested to contribute to viral pathogenesis. Enhancement of virus fusion by anti-HA2 subunit antibodies is another mechanism of influenza-ADE and has been shown to be responsible for the occurrence of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) in pigs immunized with inactivated H1N2 vaccine and challenged with pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus (Gauger et al. 2011; Khurana et al. 2013) . Influenza-ADE is also suggested by epidemiologic observations in humans. Retrospective analysis of medical records from the 1918 influenza pandemic revealed association of prior influenzalike illness with increased risk of medically attended illness during the pandemic period (Shanks et al. 2016) . More recently, prior receipt of seasonal influenza vaccine was found to increase the risk of medically attended pandemic H1N1 illness during 2009 in Canada (Skowronski et al. 2010) . Furthermore, presence of high titer non-protective serum antibodies was associated with immune complex-mediated severe H1N1 illness during this pandemic (Monsalvo et al. 2011; To et al. 2012) .",

However, vaccine-mediated protection and absence of VAERD is also reported in few studies in pigs, suggesting that vaccine-induced ADE occurs only in certain conditions, which are not yet clearly understood (Reeth et al. 2004; Kyriakis et al. 2010; Ricklin et al. 2016) . Regarding therapeutic candidates, Phase 2 studies of anti-HA stalk mAbs have indicated possibility of enhanced viral shedding in some treated human subjects. Screening for high potency protective antibodies, defining optimal dose range for effective neutralization, using cocktails of mAbs with different antigen specificities, has been suggested for mitigation of ADE (Chan-Hui and Swiderek 2016).",

            "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a member of family Paramyxoviridae, genus Pneumovirus, is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections among infants and young children worldwide, with severe disease requiring hospitalization occurring most frequently between 6 weeks and 6 months of life (Glezen et al. 1986; Hall et al. 2009 ). RSV disease is also a major health problem in adults and the elderly. Severe bronchiolitis is one of the major outcomes of RSV infection. Observation of enhanced disease among children receiving the formalininactivated RSV (FI-RSV) vaccine in the 1960s (Kim et al. 1969) , as well as the frequent occurrence of severe disease among infants <6 months of age, when maternal antibodies are present, prompted investigations on ADE of RSV infections. Subsequently, enhancement of RSV infection by RSV-specific monoclonal antibodies and human immune sera was demonstrated in vitro in monocytic (U937, THP-1) and macrophage-like (P388D1) cell lines (Gimenez et al. 1989 (Gimenez et al. , 1996 Krilov et al. 1989; Osiowy et al. 1994) . The phenomenon has also been reported in Bonnet monkeys developing enhanced disease following FI-RSV immunization (Ponnuraj et al. 2001 (Ponnuraj et al. , 2003 . Fc\u03b3R-mediated internalization of immune complexes is the suggested mechanism, with antibodies against the viral surface glycoproteins, the attachment glycoprotein (G) and fusion glycoprotein (F), playing an important role. Although epithelial cells of the respiratory tract are primary targets of RSV infection, it has been suggested that alveolar macrophages are infected through ADE, resulting in activation of Th2 response and increased expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, thus causing enhanced disease (Gimenez et al., 1996) . Further, ADE-mediated infection of lung dendritic cells (DCs) has been demonstrated to negatively modulate DC cell function, resulting in impaired T-cell activation, and has been suggested to contribute to RSV pathogenesis (Gomez et al. 2016 ). However, the clinical effects of RSV-ADE still remain unclear with different studies reporting contradictory observations regarding the association of maternal antibody-induced ADE and disease severity in infants (Chanock et al. 1970; van Erp et al. 2017) .",

As far as immunotherapeutics are concerned, the F protein-specific humanized monoclonal antibody, Palivizumab, is the only clinically approved intervention.

Of the four Ebola virus species infecting humans, Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) is the most virulent and is the causative agent of a severe hemorrhagic fever disease, Ebola virus disease (EVD), with a fatality rate of ~90% (Feldmann and Geisbert 2011) . The disease is zoonotic, with initial cases occurring due to contact with infected fruit bats (reservoir) or their contaminated material, followed by human-to-human transmission. The virus is mainly endemic in Africa; however, due to its increased incidence and fast spread, as observed during the 2014-2016 African outbreak, the virus is considered a pandemic threat. ADE of Ebola virus infection has been demonstrated in vitro in a variety of cell lines and is shown to be mediated by antibodies specific to the viral envelope glycoprotein (GP) (Takada et al. 2001 (Takada et al. , 2007 . Such enhancing antibodies have been identified in the sera of EVD patients Furuyama et al. 2016) . Two different mechanisms have been proposed for ADE of EBOV infection: (a) Fc\u03b3R-mediated ADE and (b) C1q-mediated ADE. In Fc\u03b3R-mediated ADE, antibody-virus complexes bind cell surface Fc\u03b3RIIA triggering phosphorylation of Src family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and activation of Src signaling pathways leading to virus uptake through phagocytosis and/or micropinocytosis (Furuyama et al. 2016 ). C1q-mediated ADE involves interaction of virus-bound antibodies with complement component C1q and subsequent attachment to cell surface C1q receptors, leading to virus internalization by C1q receptor-mediated endocytosis or via virus-specific receptor (Takada et al. , 2007 . C1q receptors are present on monocytes/macrophages, which are primary targets of EBOV, as well as most other mammalian cells, including endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and hepatocytes. C1q-ADE mediated dissemination of EBOV infection to these \"secondary target cells\" has been suggested to exacerbate disease.",

The protective effect of these vaccines seems to depend on cytotoxic T-cell responses.

Although public health measures successfully contained further spread and human outbreaks, future reemergence of SARS-CoV or other related viruses remains a credible threat due to the zoonotic origin of this virus. ADE of SARS-CoV infection was first demonstrated in vitro in human B cells using sera from immunized animals as well as convalescent patients (Kam et al. 2007) . Further studies showed that antibodies specific to the viral surface spike glycoprotein (S) are capable of enhancing viral infection of immune cells, particularly monocytes and macrophages, thus allowing the virus to broaden its cellular tropism (Jaume et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2014; Yip et al. 2014) . Internalization of the immune complexes by cellular Fc\u03b3Rs, mainly Fc\u03b3RIIA, is the suggested mechanism, with intracellular signaling by the Fc\u03b3R cytosolic domain playing an important role. This Fc\u03b3R-mediated internalization follows a pH-and cysteine protease-independent pathway and differs from the endosomal/lysosomal pathway utilized by angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the accepted receptor for SARS-CoV. Such antibody-mediated infection of macrophages, however, was not found to support productive virus replication or modify expression of cytokines/ chemokines (Yip et al. 2016) . Although demonstrated recently in rhesus monkeys , the occurrence of SARS-ADE and its association with disease severity in humans are still debated, with different clinical studies reporting both protective and disease-enhancing effects of anti-SARS-CoV antibodies (Lee et al. 2006; Zhang et al. 2006 ).",

Another recent study observed enhanced attachment of CHIKV to primary human monocytes and B cells and increased viral replication in the murine macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, in the presence of anti-CHIKV antibodies (Lum et al. 2018 ). Further, this study also detected higher viral RNA load and enhancement of disease severity in mice infected with CHIKV in the presence of sub-neutralizing concentrations of antibody, thus providing the first evidence for ADE of CHIKV infection and disease. The enhancement was found to be Fc\u03b3R-mediated, with Fc\u03b3RII playing a predominant role. However, ADE of CHIKV infection has not been reported to date in humans, and thus, the clinical significance of these findings remains unknown and warrants further investigation.",

However, under sub-neutralizing or non-neutralizing conditions, the antibodies are capable of enhancing viral infection by providing an alternative route of virus entry into host cells. This phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement facilitates viral infection of a larger number of primary target cells and also allows viral entry into otherwise nonsusceptible secondary target cells, thus broadening the virus tropism. Moreover, ADE also modulates the host intracellular signaling pathways, thereby turning down the antiviral immune response. Together these mechanisms serve to augment viral replication and pathogenesis, with the balance between neutralizing and enhancing antibodies influencing the outcome of viral infection and disease.",

While the occurrence of DENV-ADE in humans and its association with severe disease have been clearly demonstrated, the clinical relevance of ADE in other viruses is not completely understood. Nevertheless, ADE remains a concern in development and use of vaccines and immunotherapeutics against these viruses. Recent advances in identification of neutralizing and enhancing viral epitopes are expected to guide future design of non-enhancing, protective viral vaccines and therapeutic mAbs. Comprehensive evaluation of humoral and cell-mediated immune response to vaccines in preclinical and clinical studies, with the help of robust assays that can detect ADE, is suggested to be crucial for the assessment of vaccine safety and efficacy. Such evaluations would require a better understanding of the immune correlates of protection. Lastly, investigation of long-term effects of vaccine implementation is advisable while considering approval for future vaccines.",

(b) In the presence of non-neutralizing or sub-neutralizing concentrations of antibody, an additional pathway of entry into host cell is available to the virus. Virus-antibody immune complexes are internalized via antibody interaction with cell surface Fc receptor (FcR), resulting in antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral infection and replication. Internalized immune complexes bring about suppression of cellular innate antiviral immune response further boosting viral replication. (c) In the presence of neutralizing concentrations of antibody, virus attachment and entry into host cell is blocked",
