Nasal swabs were obtained for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing and a respiratory viral panel. Chest radiography performed after intubation showed bilateral infiltrates and partial collapse of the right upper lobe (Figure 1B). Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal cardiac anatomy and function. The white-cell count was 4000 per cubic millimeter with 55% lymphocytes; levels of inflammatory markers were elevated (full laboratory results are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this case at NEJM.org).",
