In addition, finding an organism on the common tests employed (of airway secretions) does not prove that organism is causing the LRTI. In addition, the problem is compounded by the fact that many healthy children harbor both viruses and bacteria in their airways [11] . These findings suggest that the management of a LRTI in children requires choosing therapies based on clinical findings rather than on special investigations. The possible causes of pneumonia in children are listed in Table 2 .2. Bacteria are the important organisms causing pneumonia-related death [1, 3, 4] . Streptococcus pneumoniae is the commonest cause of bacterial pneumonia, but with the introduction of vaccination against pneumococcus around the world, this cause of pneumonia is becoming less common. Other bacteria that remain a cause of pneumonia include Staphyloccocus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae, both type b (Hib) and non-typeable disease. The routine immunization of children against Hib has decreased the incidence of pneumonia due to this bacterium, although nontypeable strains are still responsible for a significant proportion of pneumonia. In addition pathogens vary by age and neonates and children younger than 2 months of age Gram-negative bacteria, Group B streptococcus, S. aureus, and C. trachomitis, are important causes.

The role of bacterial co-infections in children with a respiratory virus-associated pneumonia is frequently under emphasized owing to limited tools for diagnosing bacterial pneumonia, with blood culture sensitivity ranging from 3 to 18% for detecting pneumococcal pneumonia [28] . However, epidemiological studies have identified a strong temporal association between some respiratory viruses and invasive pneumococcal disease. Included among these are studies on the temporal association of the influenza virus and RSV epidemics and invasive pneumococcal disease [29] . Further evidence for this association was observed in an randomized controlled trial of an investigational 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), in which children vaccinated with PCV had a 32% lower risk of being hospitalized for a viral-associated pneumonia compared with placebo recipients [30] . This lower risk of respiratory virus-associated hospitalization was evident for influenza virus, hMPV and RSV-associated pneumonia [31] . The biological rationale for the reduction in respiratory virus-associated pneumonia among the PCV-vaccinated children in this study, was attributed to vaccination having prevented the superimposed vaccine-serotype pneumococcal co-infection, which would have led to progression to more severe disease, culminating in hospitalization among the placebo recipients.

Diagnostic testing should not lead to delay in initiation of therapy as this may adversely affect outcome. Empirical treatment should be commenced based on the most likely pathogen and modified according to microbiological results. The following points should be considered when investigating the etiology:\u2022 General tests of infection including acute phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP)), white cell count (WBC), neutrophil count and procalcitonin will not differentiate between bacterial and viral pneumonia[57][58][59] \u2022 Blood culture may be useful to identify bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial sensitivity, but only about 5% of blood cultures are positive in HIV-uninfected children with bacterial CAP. The sensitivity of blood cultures is greater in HIVinfected children, in whom approximately 18% of cultures are positive[28]", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "Table 2.5).
