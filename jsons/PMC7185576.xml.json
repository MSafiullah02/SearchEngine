Structural details gathered from a target structure in the presence of unique ligands can provide fundamental insights on the geometric fit of these compounds into the binding site, on the binding of active conformations, on molecular electrostatic potentials and on hydrophobic interactions [4]. From 1980 to nowadays, the applicability of structural biology was extended to the assessment of target druggability, to the identification of hits by virtual screening with structure-based virtual screening methods, to target identification by structure-sequence homology recognition [5].",

Structure-based became extremely fashionable during the 1980s, as a consequence of the publication of the structures of the first important drug targets. Later on, due the limited number of protein structures available and to the cost and time required to set up the crystallization process, the use of these rational approaches dropped in favour of high-throughput screening methods and combinatorial chemistry [5]. The successful story of HIV protease inhibitors [6, 7] and influenza antiviral drug Relenza [8] led to a renewed interest in target structure-driven drug discovery. Furthermore, the numerous advances in science and technology promoted a faster and less expensive application of structural biology, increasing the speed of macromolecular structure determination, increasing the resolution of new crystal structures and allowing smaller amounts of protein and fewer crystals to be required to solve a structure [9].",

HIV-1 was recognised as the responsible for the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the early 1980s [18], and the discovery of the first selective HIV-1 protease inhibitors is still one of the most popular examples of the use of X-ray crystallography in the development of a drug in clinical use. The HIV protease was validated as a potential drug target in 1985 [19, 20], the first X-ray crystal structures of the enzyme began appearing in 1989 [21, 22, 23, 24] and the first HIV protease inhibitor Saquinavir was licensed only six years later, followed by the approval of Ritonavir four months later [25]. Three fundamental steps led to Saquinavir discovery, the first one being the classification of HIV protease as a member of the aspartate protease family, which comprises also pepsin and renin [26]. Homology with renin, already a target in the design of anti-hypertensive agents, suggested a potential approach for the development of selective inhibitors of this enzyme [26], and this research interest was reinforced by the resolution of the first crystal structures for HIV [21, 24], along with the protease structure of the related Rous sarcoma virus [22]. Finally, useful information on protease inhibition by transition-state analogue inhibitors [27, 28, 29] guided a series of investigations on the minimum size required for a small molecule to inhibit this enzyme. Extensive structure\u2013activity relationship studies and X-ray experiments directed to address this aspect resulted in the discovery of Saquinavir.",

An engineered high-resolution crystal form of pandemic 2009 influenza polymerase acidic protein N-terminal endonuclease domain was used for the crystallographic fragment screening of 775 fragments, leading to the identification of hit fragment 14a, which showed a binding affinity to the enzyme in the range of 1000 \u03bcM and also revealed the presence of a third metal ion in the active site cleft, previously unknown. Different cycles of rational modifications on the hit scaffold were performed in order to maximise the interactions with the active site of the enzyme.

For the study of the same viral target, different crystal structures in complex with peptidyl inhibitors have recently been used to design novel triazole-based macrocyclic inhibitors (represented by compound 20 in Figure 8), which also inhibit the viral replication in cells with EC50 values in the low micromolar range [61\u2022]. Finally, structural biology has been essential also for the identification of novel inhibitors of norovirus RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase. A docking-based in silico search method on the polymerase structure using commercially available compounds led to the discovery of suramin and its analogues [62] and of PPNDS [63, 64] as novel inhibitors of the norovirus RdRp activity. The resolution of the crystal structure of PPNDS in complex with the enzyme has also indicated the possibility to target a new binding sub-pocket in the thumb domain of the enzyme for the design of new norovirus inhibitors [64].",

Used in combination with computational techniques, structure-based methods are often among the earliest and most important steps of drug-discovery campaigns of most pharmaceutical companies, and their fundamental application for the discovery of new antivirals can only be expected to increase over the next years, supported by the continuous evolution of associated technologies.",
