Longitudinal lung function assessments were performed at approximately 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of corrected age in preterm infants. Perinatal characteristics were further analyzed to ascertain the determinants of lung function indexes. Although all preterm infants (n = 121; 61 without BPD and 60 with BPD) exhibited decreased lung function in early infancy (6 months of age), after body length was adjusted for, only infants with BPD exhibited poor performance. Furthermore, the lung function of infants with mild to moderate BPD caught up gradually, but the generally poor lung function performance of infants with severe BPD, especially in forced expiratory flow, persisted until later age (24 months). Regarding perinatal characteristics, the z-score of body length at the time of examination and total number of days on positive-pressure ventilation are the major determinants of lung function in later infancy.",

The \"new\" form of BPD, deemed a developmental disorder, differs pathologically and clinically from the \"old\" form 2 . Before the period of antenatal steroid and intratracheal surfactant, the \"old\" BPD occurred in preterm infants (usually late preterm) who suffered from surfactant deficiency. These infants required high-ratio oxygen and ventilatory support, which trigger a heterogenous lung injury and remodeling. The sequels of lung damage marks with regions of atelectasis and hyperinflation, hyperplasia of airway smooth muscle, lung fibrosis, and pulmonary vascular hypertensive changes 3 . After the period of prenatal steroid and postnatal surfactant intervention, the mortality of BPD significantly decreased, and shifted the demographics of BPD to more extreme preterm infants. \"New\" BPD then occurred and being characterized by arrested alveolar-capillary development, namely fewer and larger alveoli develop, reducing the overall surface available for gas exchange 4 .

At 24 months of age, except for infants with severe BPD-who exhibited unchanged (or even poorer) performance-the absolute values of all lung function indexes exhibited a gradual increasing trend (Fig. 1) . Compared with infants with no BPD and mild to moderate BPD, infants with severe BPD had significantly lower Vt and Crs, higher Rrs, and lower indexes of tidal and raised-volume forced expiration at every measured time point (until 24 months of age); furthermore, respiratory function was negatively correlated with BPD severity. Table 4 and Fig. 1 present the scores and trends of the respiratory function of infants with BPD of various severity levels obtained after z-score transformation of the aforementioned indexes by using the local healthy refs. 14, 15 . Children with severe BPD in their infancy persistently exhibited poor performance; their z-scores of respiratory function (V'max FRC , FEV 0.5 , FVC, and FEF 25-75 ) deteriorated with age (18 and 24 months of age). Although children with mild to moderate BPD had relatively lower lung function in early life, their performance (except for V'max FRC ) gradually improved later in life. Moreover, children without BPD in infancy initially exhibited lower values in lung function (especially in V'max FRC , FEV 0.5 , FVC, and FEF ), but their status improved by 12-18 months of age.",

Tidal volume (p = 0.006) resistance of respiratory system (p = 0.037) were positively related with gestational age at birth.

This study along with other studies of either previous \"old\" and present \"new\" BPD population, have revealed that such survivors experience persistent impairment in lung function 6, 7, 11 . Our study had shown some initial derangements in lung function (e.g., low respiratory system compliance and increased airway resistance) progressively recovered by 2 years of age. However, significant airflow limitation-measured as tidal and raised-volume forced expiration and low tidal volumeremained unchanged in children with severe BPD. Furthermore, our multivariate GEE model indicated that the number of days on positive-pressure ventilation was significantly inverse associated with z-scores of the majority of lung-function parameters in the later life. Performance of raised-volume flow-volume curve was also positively related to z-score of body length of preterm infants. Interestingly, current definition of BPD severity of preterm infants can't well predict the outcome of their lung function in later life. Progress in perinatal intensive care has enabled the identification of characteristic pathological findings of new BPD, which are a reduced number of alveoli with relatively simple and large structures and dysplasia of the pulmonary microvasculature 17 .

Although alveolarization continues throughout childhood, the outcomes are influenced by prenatal and early postnatal characteristics. Therefore, the lung function trajectories of adults appear to be partially determined very early in life. Both preterm birth and tobacco exposure have previously been associated with persistently low lung function performance during childhood and adolescence 31 . In a recent cohort study, preterm children with or without BPD exhibited a persistent decline in lung function after 4 years of age 32 . However, the determinants of lung function evolution among preterm infants had not previously been investigated. Our study clarified lung function evolution in such preterm infants. Impaired body length growth impedes lung function performance during growth. Sanchez-Solis et al. recently also shown that the gain of body length is associated with increase in lung function (exam of raised-volume forced expiration) 33 . This may related to the fact that body length is the dominant determinant of lung function in infants and preschool children 14, 15, 34 . Furthermore, our study found that postnatal respiratory morbidity (ventilator days) is significantly related to the performance of lung function (especially in exams of forced expiratory flow) in their later life up to preschool age. These results are consistent with the theory of continuous airway remodeling during infancy.",

First, because this was a cohort study and not a case-control study, only a few patients had undergone all examinations at all time points. Therefore, obtaining well-defined trajectories of lung function evolution in individual preterm infants was difficult. Second, the airflow limitation may be affected by airway abnormalities, such as tracheobronchomalcia and congenital airway anomalies. Although chest computed tomography or bronchoscopy were not routinely performed in the study, infants with clinically evident airway anomalies were initially excluded from current study, thus minimizing the confounding effects. Third, several factors, such as preterm, severe postnatal respiratory infection, and maternal smoking, may be associated poor respiratory performance in later life. In this study, we had excluded infants with severe postnatal respiratory Table 4 .

In addition, although studies have demonstrated that maternal smoking unfavorably affects the respiratory function and health of infants 35, 36 . This might have biased our results because prenatal tobacco exposure was not considered in our analysis. Nevertheless, only 3% of mothers of our study cohort reported smoking during pregnancy, and our previous study did not reveal any effect of maternal smoking on lung function 13, 14 .",
