Due to the segmented RNA genome structure, the viruses frequently and constantly alter their antigenic characteristics, and consequently change their infectivity and pathogenicity. To cope with these diverse strains or subtypes, influenza vaccines need to induce cross-reactive immune responses capable of covering a wide range of subtypes. The use of adjuvants, such as alum and MF59, improves the potency of the vaccine in terms of breadth and the magnitude of immune responses to the vaccine antigens [1], [2]. Therefore, efficacious adjuvants could be a breakthrough for the development of a \u2018universal\u2019 influenza vaccine.",

Among diverse mucosal routes, intranasal delivery is particularly advantageous in eliciting the strongest respiratory immune response, which plays a critical role in the protection against respiratory infections such as influenza [5]. Two intranasal influenza vaccines, FluMist and NASOVAC, are currently available and both consist of attenuated-live viruses. In addition to these licensed vaccines, many studies have revealed the possibility of protein-based intranasal vaccination against respiratory pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and respiratory syncytial virus [6], [7]. However, no approved intranasal adjuvant, capable of enhancing the immunogenicity of protein-based or killed-virus vaccine antigens, has been developed to date.",

Due to the nature of these components, OMVs can stimulate the host immune system through innate immune receptors, including toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs) [9]. In recent studies, intramuscular injection of OMV with irrelevant antigens enhanced antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses, and increased the protection rate against tumor and virus challenges [10], [11]. However, in order to use OMVs as vaccine adjuvants or delivery vehicles, the safety of this system must be addressed because LPS in OMVs may excessively provoke innate immune responses and lead to endotoxicity.",

            "text": "The endotoxicity of LPS is highly related to the structure of the lipid A moiety, particularly the degree of acylation [15], [16]. Previously, we generated an E. coli W3110 \u0394msbB/\u0394pagP strain that produces LPS, on which lipid A is penta-acylated [13]. In order to further attenuate the endotoxicity of E. coli LPS in this study, we introduced lpxF, a lipid A 4\u2032-phosphatase from Francisella novicida (Fig.1\nA) [17], [18]. The size of purified fmOMV was similar to that of nOMV, ranging from 50 to 150 nm in diameter and its morphology was spherical (Table 1\nand Fig.1B). In addition, both OMVs had similar zeta potential values of approximately \u221213.5 mV (Table 1). Interestingly, when fmOMV was tested for the activation of diverse TLRs in vitro, it triggered significantly reduced TLR4 signaling compared to that induced by nOMV (p\n < 0.001\u20130.005), whereas both OMVs activated TLR2 and TLR5 to a similar extent (Fig.1C). In agreement with this in vitro result, fmOMV showed significantly lower endotoxicity than nOMV following delivery into mice. While nOMV resulted in significant weight loss and red consolidation in the lung tissue 2 or 3 days after intranasal administration, fmOMV caused milder weight loss and inflammation in the lungs (Fig.1D and E). Notably, 1 \u03bcg of fmOMV did not cause body weight loss or pulmonary inflammation. These data indicate that fmOMV carrying penta-acylated and mono-phosphorylated lipid A species reduced TLR4-stimulating activity in vitro and significantly attenuated endotoxicity in vivo compared with nOMV.",

            "text": "Previously, it has been shown that co-immunization of OMV increased the antigen-specific immune response to co-delivered antigens in intramuscular vaccination models [11], [13]. To investigate whether the intranasal delivery of fmOMV effectively induces strong antigen-specific immune responses, we injected influenza vaccine antigens with various doses of fmOMV (1.0\u201310 \u03bcg) intranasally. Two weeks after the second immunization, the influenza-specific IgG response was significantly higher in all three groups that were administered with fmOMV compared to that of the vaccine-alone group (p\n = 0.0023, 0.0009, and 0.0018, respectively) and was comparable to that of the CT-treated group (p\n = 0.674, Fig.2\nA). The antibody titers of both IgG1 and IgG2c also significantly increased in mice co-injected with fmOMV and the vaccine (p\n < 0.001\u20130.05, Fig.2B). IgG1 and IgG2c titers exhibited an inverse relationship with escalating fmOMV dose; although the IgG1 titer decreased (Fig.2B, left panel), the IgG2c titer increased (Fig.2B, right panel). Consistent with the serum IgG response, HI activity against pH1N1 virus was significantly higher in fmOMV-co-immunized groups (1.0 and 3.0 \u03bcg of fmOMV) compared to that of the vaccine alone-immunized group (Fig.2C). Since cell-mediated adaptive immunity also contributes to protection against influenza infection [2], [19], we measured the frequency of the influenza-specific IFN-\u03b3-secreting T cells. Notably, only 1.0 \u03bcg of fmOMV significantly enhanced the antigen-specific T cell response, whereas the T cell response in the 3 and 10 \u03bcg-fmOMV-injected groups were comparable to that of vaccine-alone injected group (Fig.2D). Collectively, intranasal administration of fmOMV was shown to enhance systemic humoral and cellular responses to an influenza vaccine.",

            "text": "To verify that co-administration of fmOMV modulates immune responses in the respiratory mucosa, the level of influenza-specific antibodies in the BALF samples was determined. The dose of fmOMV was fixed to 1 \u03bcg because this amount of fmOMV was sufficient to increase the levels of antibody and T cell responses without resulting in toxicity in vivo (Figs. 1B\u2013D and 2). Consistent with serum IgG levels (Fig.2A), fmOMV significantly increased antigen-specific IgG levels in the BALF (p\n = 0.0105, vs. vaccine alone, Fig.3\nA, left panel). In addition, secretory IgA in the BALF, which plays an important role in the protection against mucosal infection [20], dramatically increased in the fmOMV-injected group compared with that of the vaccine-alone immunized group (Fig.3A, right panel). fmOMV co-administration also significantly enhanced influenza-specific T cell responses in the lungs (p\n = 0.0015, Fig.3B). Since fmOMVs contain diverse TLR ligands such as LPS and lipoproteins, which can stimulate antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [8], we examined the change in DCs in mLNs after treatment with fmOMV and DQ-OVA model antigen. The DC population in the mLNs dramatically increased after intranasal administration of DQ-OVA + fmOMV as compared to that of DQ-OVA treatment alone (3.21 vs. 0.72%, Fig.3C, left panel). This indicates active migration of DCs from the tissue to the draining LNs by fmOMV administration. In addition to the increase in number, the DCs in the mLNs exhibited high levels of DQ-OVA signal or antigen uptake and up-regulation of CD80 (Fig.3C, left panel). CD103+ DCs are critical for the induction of immune responses in the respiratory tract [21], [22]. The CD103+ population in CD11blo/intCD11chi lung cells increased more than 2-fold through fmOMV administration (53% and 22% in fmOMV-co-injected and DQ-OVA alone-injected groups, respectively, Fig.3C, left panel). The activated phenotype of DCs was not observed in the non-draining subiliac LNs (Fig.3C, right panel), indicating that fmOMV affected DCs at the local delivery site. These data show that intranasal vaccination with fmOMV activates CD103+ DCs in the lungs and enhances both antibody and T cell responses in the respiratory mucosa.",

            "text": "Given that fmOMV efficiently elicit both mucosal and systemic antigen-specific immune responses, we next examined the protective efficacy of vaccination with fmOMV by challenging mice with a lethal dose of influenza virus. When a 10LD50 dose of pH1N1 virus was intranasally administered, the fmOMV-co-immunized mice did not lose body weight and demonstrated a 90\u2013100% survival rate for all three groups (p\n = 0.0001 and 0.0008, Fig.4\nA). Lung virus titer was also significantly reduced by vaccination with fmOMV (p\n = 0.07084 and 0.00037 on DPI 4 and 7, respectively, Fig.4B). To verify that fmOMV-co-immunization conferred cross-protective immunity, a requirement for influenza vaccines, we challenged the mice with PR8 and H5N2 viruses and monitored the body weight loss and survival rate. Although the body weight decreased by about 15% up to day 7 after the challenge with PR8 virus, the mice showed a gradual recovery in body weight and exhibited a 87.5% survival rate (p\n = 0.0055, Fig.4C). Similarly, when the mice were challenged with H5N2 virus, the fmOMV-co-immunized group exhibited a significant increase in the survival rate (87.5%, p\n = 0.0008, Fig.4D). Even though fmOMV significantly enhanced influenza-specific adaptive immune responses and protective immunity against viral infection, it is possible that fmOMV contributed to the protective efficacy of the vaccine by inducing innate immune responses in the respiratory tract [23], [24], [25], [26]. To verify if innate immunity contributed to the observed protective efficacy, mice were injected with different doses of fmOMV alone (ranging from 1 to 10 \u03bcg) in the absence of an influenza vaccine antigen and challenged 2 weeks later with 10 LD50 of pH1N1 virus. From day 3 post infection, all mice began to lose body weight irrespective of the fmOMV dose, which resulted in most of them dying between day 7 and 8 post infection (Fig.4E). Survivors were only detected in the group given 10 \u03bcg of fmOMV for which a 50% survival rate was observed. However, the survival rate of this group was not statistically significant when compared with that of the PBS group (p\n = 0.2363), indicating that innate immunity is not involved in the protective efficacy observed after co-administration of fmOMV as an adjuvant. Therefore, these data, together with the previous results showing enhanced adaptive immune responses (Fig. 2, Fig. 3), demonstrate that vaccination with fmOMV provided broad protective efficacy against homologous and heterologous influenza viruses based on adaptive immune responses.",

For the control of these highly infectious variants or prevention of mass infection, influenza vaccines need to provide immediate protective immunity and long-term memory immune responses. To check whether the fmOMV-adjuvanted vaccine meets these requirements, we first vaccinated the mice once, and challenged them with a lethal dose of pH1N1 virus 2 weeks later. Vaccination with fmOMV significantly increased the survival rate, whereas vaccine alone failed to protect the mice (p\n = 0.0004, Fig.5\nA). In terms of long-term efficacy, the mice were challenged with a lethal dose of influenza virus (10LD50), 20 weeks after the booster immunization. The fmOMV-co-immunized group exhibited a similar survival rate compared to that of the CT-co-immunized group (Fig.5B); indicating that co-administration of fmOMV conferred prolonged protective immunity. These data show that intranasal vaccination with fmOMV induces both immediate and prolonged protective immunity, suggesting that fmOMV could be a useful vaccine adjuvant in a pandemic situation.",

In terms of safety, however, native OMVs cannot be applied for vaccination because they contain fully endotoxic LPS, which induces excessive immune activation and inflammation [31]. The endotoxicity of LPS is closely related to the degree of acylation of the lipid A moiety [15], [16], [32]. Therefore, in this study, we generated an msbB- and pagP-deletion strain (Fig.1A) lacking the acyltransferase and palmitoyltransferase required for the maximum acylation of lipid A. In addition, we introduced the lpxF gene, which encodes lipid A 4\u2032-phosphatase, to further attenuate the endotoxicity of LPS by generating mono-phosphoryl lipid A (Fig.1A) [17]. As expected, fmOMV produced from the genetically engineered E. coli showed much greater attenuation than nOMV in terms of TLR4-stimulating activity in vitro and toxicity in vivo (Fig. 1C\u2013E). This approach agrees well with the development of the mono-phosphoryl lipid A adjuvant for wide range of human vaccines [33].",

In this study, we observed a substantial increase in the CD11bloCD11chiCD103+ population in the mLNs after 24 h of fmOMV treatment (Fig.3C). The DCs from fmOMV-injected mice also showed an increased level of activation markers and antigen uptake signals, suggesting that fmOMV stimulated CD103+ DCs in the lungs, leading to an enhanced adaptive immune response and consequently an increase in vaccine efficacy.

Many adjuvants or vaccines targeting T cell responses have been shown to induce cross-reactive T cell responses and provide protective immunity to heterologous influenza infection [36], [37], [38], [39]. In addition to T cell responses, broad-specific neutralizing antibodies are known to be cross-protective [40], [41]. Serum samples from fmOMV-co-immunized mice weakly bound to HA-stalk antigens in ELISA, suggesting that fmOMV did not efficiently induce an HA stalk-specific antibody response (data not shown). Because the IFN-\u03b3 response was significantly increased in the fmOMV-infected group (Figs. 2D and 3B), it appears that the enhanced T cell response mainly contributed to the increased survival rate in the fmOMV-co-immunized group. Even though the differences in survival rates between the groups challenged with heterologous viruses (PR8 and H5N2) and the one challenged with homologous virus (pH1N1) were not statistically significant (87.5% vs. 100%, respectively; p\n = 0.3173), body weight in the groups receiving a heterologous virus challenge tended to decline more during the early phase of infection when compared with the group receiving a homologous virus challenge (Fig.4C and D, upper panels vs. Fig.4A, left panel). These observations suggest that a cross-reactive T cell response, rather than a cross-reactive neutralizing antibody response, contributed to the clearance of virus presumably by removing infected cells during the late phase of infection.",

            "text": "The CT-injected group clearly showed a reverse correlation between IgG1 and IgG2c titers (Fig.2B), and this observation agrees well with the fact that CT is a potent Th2-biased adjuvant [42], [43], [44]. fmOMV simultaneously increased IgG2c and decreased IgG1 titers, indicating that fmOMV promotes Th1-dominant immune responses (Fig.2B). This observation can be further supported by the fact that fmOMV has strong Th1-stimulating components such as LPS, flagellin, and bacterial DNA fragments containing CpG motifs [8], [9]. Nevertheless, it was unexpected that increasing the dose of fmOMV down-regulated the antigen-specific IFN-\u03b3 response (Fig.2D). One possible explanation for this is that over-activation of APCs, especially DCs, may negatively regulate antigen-specific T cell responses by secreting IFN-\u03b3 and, in turn, induce the expression of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Although IDO is well known to suppress T cell responses by depleting tryptophan [45], [46], B cell responses appear not to be as sensitive to this mechanism as T cell responses. Rather, IDO has shown an activating role during Th2-mediated inflammatory responses [47], which correlates well with our observation that T cell responses decreased with increasing fmOMV doses whereas antibody responses remained high (Fig.2A and D). Further study is required to assess the underlying mechanism of this dose-dependent inverse correlation between fmOMV dose and T cell response.",
