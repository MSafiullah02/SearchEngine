This virus gains entry to host cells via ACE2, which is expressed by type 2 alveolar epithelial cells in the lungs and by cells in other tissues, including the heart, kidney and blood vessels. Researchers now show that SARS-CoV-2 can infect human blood vessel and kidney organoids and that this infection can be inhibited by human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2).",

Treatment of cells with hrsACE2 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in a dose-dependent manner and attenuated propagation of the virus.",

Following infection of the organoids with SARS-CoV-2 the researchers could detect viral RNA that increased in the days following infection, indicative of viral replication. Addition of hrsACE2, however, again reduced SARS-CoV-2 levels in a dose-dependent manner. \u201cOur findings not only suggest that tissue organoids can be used to study the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on extrapulmonary tissues, but also suggest that rhsACE2 might block the virus from entering target cells,\u201d says Penninger.",
