Although morbidity is high and most of the animals in the herd can be affected within a week, mortality is usually low in adult animals (3%), which can recover in 7\u201310 days. However, when piglets less than 4\u20135 weeks are infected, mortality is usually 50% and can reach 90% in severe outbreaks, as usually happens in transmissible gastroenteritis. Besides the mortality, PEDV infection causes important economic loses due to the diminishing of the productive indexes (Pensaert, 1999).",

However, it has been proposed that cellular immune response may play an important role in the protection and recovery from infection, besides the fact that production of antibodies is regulated by cytokines produced by activated T lymphocytes and other mononuclear cells (Corthesy and Kraehenbuhl, 1999, Kraehenbuhl and Neutra, 1992, Saif, 1999, Totterdell et al., 1988).",

The maximum values were found around postinoculation day 21, just when a strong response of virus-specific antibody-secreting cells was detected in this organ and also in the duodenum and ileum lamina propria (De Arriba et al., 2001b). In pigs inoculated with the attenuated strain of PEDV this specific lymphoproliferative response was detected later, at postinoculation day 14 and it was lower that in pigs inoculated with the wild virus. This minor response of group 2 also corresponded to a low response of PEDV-specific antibody-secreting cells (De Arriba et al., 2001b). The difference observed between the lymphoproliferative responses of the two inoculated groups has also been described by other researchers (Brim et al., 1994, Brim et al., 1995, Ward et al., 1996) in other gastroenteric viruses of swine, describing that the lymphocyte proliferative responses induced by attenuated strains of transmissible gastroenteritis and rotavirus were significantly lower than that induced by the homologous virulent virus.",

This delay could be explained if it is considered that the PEDV-specific T cells located in blood and spleen originate in the inductive sites from the gut-associated lymphoid tissues, like the mesenteric lymph nodes, and its presence in systemic tissues is due to the homing process necessary for its maturation (Corthesy and Kraehenbuhl, 1999, Kagnoff, 1996, Kantele et al., 1997, Salmi and Jalkanen, 1997). The specific cell proliferation response in the blood was more similar to that observed in the mesenteric lymph nodes than in the spleen, especially in the group 1, in spite of both, blood and spleen, being linked to the systemic immune system. However, the blood, together with the lymphatic system, is the main vehicle for lymphocyte migration (Salmi and Jalkanen, 1997), and its lymphoid population may reflect primed T cells migrating to the gut for some time after an infection.",

Thus, Ward et al.
