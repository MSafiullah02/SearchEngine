It has been reported that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection rate from oropharyngeal sampling alone is lower than that from nasopharyngeal sampling. 5 The reasons for the difference in results may be the environment of nasopharynx and oropharynx might influence the SARS-CoV-2 environment, the patients' tolerance caused the swab to stay longer in the nasopharynx than in the oropharynx at the time of sampling (in addition, oropharyngeal sampling is more likely to cause droplet spray and occupational exposure); (3) It may be related to the sampler's technical level, inspection method, specimen kit, specimen preservation, and transportation. 6 In summary, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA results obtained from single time, single site, and single sample are not reliable. The results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from multiple times, multiple sites, and multiple specimens are of great significance for etiology diagnosis. Case 2 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA on the 17th day after close contact, which shows that, for some cases, especially those with occult infection, isolation for 14 days may not be enough. 7 According to the official microblog of the People's Daily in China, the 28th patient in Tianjin had twice negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA test results on the 6th day after the 1st day fever, and the 2nd fever on the 8th day.

            "text": "The Day After Close Contact There have been reports in China that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the stool of some patients with COVID-19, indicating that COVID-19 transmission is likely through fecal oral transmission. 8 According to reports, SARS-CoV-2 can enter host cells through the cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). 9 ACE2 is not only highly expressed in alveolar type II cell, human esophageal epithelial cells, and stratified epithelial cells, but also in absorptive enterocytes cells from the ileum and colon. 10 This study, through the bioinformatics analysis of single-cell transcriptomes, concluded that the digestive tract may be a potential pathway for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is likely to be the cause of digestive symptoms in some patients with COVID-19. In summary, whether the early diagnosis A prominent feature of the 4 patients was that the clinical signs and symptoms were inconsistent with the imaging: Signs and symptoms were mild, including normal pulse oxygen saturation, whereas the CT images showed that patients' conditions were severe. According to the clinical signs and symptoms, all 4 cases were common mild cases, but the chest CT showed viral pneumonia, such as different levels of multiple patchy ground glass opacity and interstitial changes, and even 1 case had bilateral pleural effusion. However, all patients underwent a chest X-ray examination before a CT examination, and no positive results were found. Therefore, for suspected patients, 7 especially those with no evidence of etiology, we cannot always evaluate the lung condition comprehensively and objectively through a chest X-ray examination, so that misdiagnosis happens and affects treatment. Therefore, an early chest CT examination is relatively reliable, which may reduce the rate of a missed diagnosis. The value of quantitative analysis of chest CT images for the diagnosis of this disease needs to include more cases for further research.",

Early diagnosis of this type of patients cannot be limited to 2 negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests, according to which the disease cannot be excluded. The combination of epidemiology, clinical manifestations, imaging, and etiology are required to reduce the rate of a missed diagnosis, and special attention should be paid to epidemiology history and chest CT manifestations. However, it may be unpractical to provide a full coverage of lung CT scans in early diagnosis due to a shortage of medical resources in some low-income countries: a possibly long wait, the expense concern, and so on will make case-confirming and treatment overdue. Given such concerns, chest plain film is advised to be an important reference for dynamic observation. In short, for early diagnosis of COVID-19, what must be done should always concur with what is available.",
