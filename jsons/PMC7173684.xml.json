The highly contagious virus, which caused the disease called coronavirus disease (COVID-19), spread outside China and has since become a global public health emergency [1]. In severe cases, the virus causes fatal pneumonia similar to that caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which have emerged in the past 20 years in sporadic countries all over the world [2].",

The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, which is the most common symptom, cough, fatigue, malaise, and shortness of breath. Global concerns about the virus have risen due to its high transmission capability, which may be coupled with morbidity and mortality [4]. The elderly and patients with comorbidities are more likely to be infected and are additionally more prone to serious complications, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm [5].",

Strong infection control measures are the primary intervention to minimize the spread of the virus in both health care settings and the community [6]. Public awareness of dealing with highly infectious respiratory diseases plays a vital role in limiting the spread of the infection, especially in middle and low-income countries, where health systems have, at best, the moderate capacity to respond to outbreaks. In Egypt, by the beginning of April of 2020, there were over 800 confirmed cases, with more than 50 fatalities, and a rapid tendency towards increase [7]. Vaccine development is estimated to require months, and thus management of the crisis depends primarily on people's adherence to the recommended measures taken. These measures are largely affected by knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of the public [8].",

The most common example of patient stigma in Egypt, even among healthcare groups, is the one associated with infection with HIV. A cross-sectional survey conducted at one of the Egyptian university hospitals showed that healthcare workers had high levels of stigma towards people living with HIV, and called for stigma reduction programs in Egyptian hospitals [22]. We believe that the social stigma associated with COVID-19 is much different from that of HIV, since the latter involves negative beliefs, feelings and attitudes towards those infected with the virus. On the contrary, the stigma of COVID-19 does not involve these negative feelings towards patients. Stigma towards COVID-19 is due to the fear of its mortality and high communicability, thus can be resolved through proper education and transparency of healthcare policies.",

Almost all participants in a Chinese study used to put face masks when they go out during the current pandemic [8].

On the other hand, WHO recommends using face masks only if a person has respiratory symptoms or caring for another person with symptoms [24]. There is no consensus about the rationale of use of face masks in public places to prevent the spread of COVID-19 [25]. It is recommended that guidelines about this issue be developed by governments and local public health agencies to control the unnecessary use of surgical masks, which are consumed rapidly during the current pandemic time.",

The avian influenza case of Indonesia, where the country supplied the samples but didn\u2019t have free access to the developed vaccine, clearly demonstrated this problem, and showed the imbalance between developed and developing countries in this aspect [30]. Interestingly, the Egyptian government had a very successful model for drug delivery during 100 Million Healthy Lives program to eliminate hepatitis C in Egypt [31]. First, Egyptian companies got permission to formulate several generic direct-acting antivirals against hepatitis C at a very affordable price through an exemption under the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights [32]. Second, the successful treatment program was under the umbrella of the government, which controlled the process of treatment and distribution of the drugs [31]. Finally, the program also included screening for diabetes, hypertension, as well as obesity. So, the Egyptian government now has a database of vulnerable groups among about 50 million adult Egyptian [31, 32].
