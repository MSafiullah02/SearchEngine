Although vaccine preparations bear no resemblance to the crude scab homogenates of 200 years ago, his concept of vaccination is still the basis of vaccine development today, i.e. that immunization with attenuated or killed pathogens will elicit protective responses against homologous or closely related (heterologous) pathogens. A better understanding of the immune system has been gained over the last 50 years and this deeper knowledge of innate and acquired immunity is being used for the optimal targeting of vaccines.",

However, both viral and bacterial antigens can also stimulate humoral immunity which involves the Th 2 cell response. Antibodies produced by plasma cells derived from B cells recognize free antigens (viral, bacterial, parasitic) in body fluids, and subsequently bind and inactivate them. Viruses with many identical binding sites for antibodies due to their structural symmetry, can form large aggregates when they are bound by immunoglobulins, which are taken up by phagocytes (opsonisation) and destroyed (Levine, 1992). The function of the vaccine is to aid this process by priming the animal before the pathogen invades, creating memory in the B cells and stimulating cell mediated immunity.",

In some countries where rabies is endemic or a significant threat, vaccination against this disease is also mandatory.

In some countries guidelines have been issued by informed bodies recommending which vaccines and regimes to use, and what information should be stated on product literature (Gaskell et al., 2002).",

This heterologous, broad protection is an interesting finding as different clades occur from continent to continent, and even within the US, from state to state, so that FIV vaccines need not contain all Clade types but rely on synergistic cross protection of a few.

This is an example of a current vaccine protecting against evolving pathogens, demonstrating that while viruses change at the genetic level, current vaccines can still retain their efficacy in the field. This is also true for canine distemper, canine adenovirus, feline herpesvirus and feline panleukopenia in that the strains used in the majority of vaccines, since they were first developed, still protect against field strains currently encountered.",

The climatic changes occurring worldwide have also contributed to the spread of vector borne diseases such as West Nile fever. The arthropod vectors for this virus are found as far north as the UK and recent serological studies of British wild birds have shown evidence of the virus in more than half the birds tested. Migrating birds and mosquitoes are thought to be responsible for infection in more than 20 species, including crows, magpies, swallows, chickens, turkeys and ducks. (Buckley et al., 2003). Although this virus does not appear to cause disease in cats and dogs they nevertheless can be infected. A vaccine has already been developed and has been shown experimentally to protect dogs and cats against viraemia (Karaca et al., 2005). This is a case when the zoonotic aspect of a disease must be considered even though the disease is not clinically apparent in the host animal. Horses, on the other hand, are particularly prone to the disease which reached Southern France in 2000 and infected 131 of the famous horses of the Camargue (Murgue et al., 2001).",

The immune system does not respond as well to carbohydrates as it does to proteins so the response must be enhanced by adjuvants which target one or both parts of the immune system. Vaccines against leishmaniasis usually consist of whole freeze-dried organisms of L. infantum and have varied in their efficacy. A new adjuvanted vaccine is now being trialled, prepared using only antigen proteins excreted by L. infantum. Initial results are promising, demonstrating immunity over a 2-year period in 100% of the vaccinated dogs. It is believed that this is due to Th 1 activation which induced infected cells to produce nitric oxide, killing the parasite and clearing the infection from the cells (Lemesre et al., 2005).",

Since then much research has been invested into producing safe and efficacious vaccines using this technology in a more economical and efficient way. Safety of vaccines is enhanced as reversion to virulence is no longer a risk and excretion of vaccinal virus post vaccination is eliminated. Vaccines containing sub-unit fractions of pathogens, rather than the whole organism, should also be less immune-stressful to the host as the immune system is only directed against specific antigens and not a spectrum of non-essential cell structures.",

When the vector is inoculated into the animal, it infects target cells and upon replication, expresses the foreign gene proteins as well as its own. The infected cell then releases these proteins which are detected by the immune system and a humoral and/or cell mediated immune response is initiated. In this way, protective neutralising antibodies are raised against the epitope(s) of the pathogen without the presence of the whole organism. Choice of an appropriate vector is often made by using ones that are not found naturally in the target species. For example, although canine adenoviruses and feline herpesviruses have been shown to be efficient vectors, inoculation into the respective host species may not be viable due to circulating antibodies present through vaccination or disease. Some of the most successful viral vectors for small animals have been found in the poxviruses\u2014Modified Vaccinia Ankora (Drexler et al., 2004), canarypox (Paoletti, 1996) and myxoma (McCabe et al., 2002) as cats and dogs are not naturally infected by these viruses.",

These vaccines can be injected into the muscle or intradermally by needle injection for optimal uptake. The DNA, encoding epitopes or complete antigen, is integrated into a plasmid, along with a promoter which is selected for optimal transcription, yielding high expression levels of the encoded protein. Although these vaccines elicit both cell mediated and humoral immune responses in the target species, the immune responses induced by some DNA vaccines may be lower than those elicited by conventional vaccines (Oyaski and Hildegunds, 2000). Experimental DNA vaccines have been shown to protect against a variety of diseases but two concerns are the production of sufficient quantities of DNA to make vaccination economical, and transfection efficiency. Immune responses can be enhanced significantly by the use of gene guns and electroporation which increase transfection but these technologies have not yet advanced to the stage of routine use, especially in companion animals which require user-friendly procedures. Gene guns have been available for the past few years but a practical disadvantage is the noise they produce when the gun is triggered and the pressurised gas in the chamber expels the DNA-coated gold particles into the epidermis. This sudden shock could well make the animal nervous on subsequent visits to the veterinary surgery. A second disadvantage is in deciding where to inoculate an animal whose body is covered with fur. A significant amount of work is now being undertaken to improve the efficacy of DNA delivery.",

The DNA of a vaccine virus can be manipulated to delete a specific gene so the animal does not produce antibodies to the coded protein which is present in the pathogen. Differential diagnostic tests (e.g. ELISA) are then developed to detect that particular protein absent in the vaccine. Serum from vaccinated animals would test negative while that from infected animals would test positive. The first vaccine to be used in this way was an Aujeszky disease vaccine for pigs in which both the glycoprotein (gE) and thymidine kinase (TK) genes were deleted in the vaccinal virus (Pasick, 2004). Presently, vaccine manufacturers are not required by EU directives to differentiate their vaccines from field pathogens before submitting them for registration, but as this may become a reality, sequence analysis, deleted genes and markers are fast becoming routine technology within vaccine R&D laboratories. The use of reverse genetics also enables the manipulation of RNA viruses.",

Convention for many years meant that vaccines were delivered by the subcutaneous (s/c), or in some cases, intramuscular (i/m) route. For diseases such as parvovirus and distemper, systemic antibody response correlates with protection. Vaccines given by s/c or i/m routes have been shown to produce and maintain significant protective antibody levels for many years which has resulted in major vaccine companies recommending at least bi-annual and tri-annual boosts with certain vaccine components, such as parvovirus, distemper and adenovirus, instead of the annual booster prescribed since vaccination regimes were instigated. However, circulating maternal antibodies in young animals may inhibit the take of certain vaccines when given at a young age. In some instances, as with canine distemper and parvovirus, this can be overcome to a certain degree by increasing the titre of the vaccinal virus (Chalmers and Baxendale, 1994), otherwise a second or even third vaccination has to be given when the MDA levels have decreased sufficiently to ensure vaccine take.",

Another simpler solution is to give the vaccine by the natural route by which infection takes place and becomes established. This is particularly relevant for the respiratory pathogens whose main tropisms are the cells of the upper respiratory tract and oral mucous membranes. Kennel Cough (KC) vaccines are a prime example. The organisms associated with the KC syndrome, namely Bordetella bronchiseptica, canine parainfluenza and canine adenovirus, included in mono-, bi-, or tri-valent vaccines, are usually given prior to kennelling when a rapid onset of immunity (OOI) is required, usually within 48\u201372 h post inoculation. Those which offer a duration of immunity (DOI) of 12 months can then be used to vaccinate dogs in the intermediate years between immunization with the core vaccines (CDV, CPV, CAV2) with a 3-year DOI. There are, however, mixed reactions in the veterinary profession as to the practicalities of intranasal/oral vaccination, especially in some of the larger breeds of dogs indicating that a compromise has to be reached between what is practical and what is more efficient from a scientific approach.",

However, the prime objective of any immunisation programme, regardless of the technology, is to protect the animal as quickly as possible and to maintain that immunity for as long as possible, against prevalent disease. Some vaccine companies have addressed these issues and have taken the ethical view on \u2018over vaccination\u2019 by reducing or eliminating non essential antigenic components and achieving DOIs of at least 2 years for the major components. Veterinary vaccines include a wide range of viral and bacterial antigens but it is now time to for parasitic vaccine development to catch up.
