In 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome spread globally from a Chinese wet market, causing hundreds of deaths [2] and major economic losses [3]. Avian influenza has also been repeatedly associated with wet markets [1,4]. Foodborne Campylobacter, Salmonella, Giardia, and Escherichia are most common in these settings, leading to 18 million disability-adjusted life years annually [5]. These are particularly important in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), but their true impact is unknown given that many episodes go unreported [6].",

Our analysis shows that acute gastroenteritis (food poisoning) and diarrhea were the most frequent illnesses among wet market visitors. However, this must be carefully considered from medical and epidemiological perspectives as the result is based on rarely corroborated, Web-based descriptions. We also cannot exclude that reported symptoms could have been caused by an event before or after (but unrelated to) a wet market visit.",

Even so, the pipeline we present is significant for travel medicine and epidemiology. It could ultimately contribute to predictive models for improved epidemic forecasting and to the development of diagnostic tools based on syndromic surveillance and artificial intelligence. TripAdvisor could crosstalk with other social networks (eg, Yelp) for maximal information coverage and partner with other initiatives for a more structured collection of wet market\u2013related health information in near-real time. In this way, we can gain an improved understanding of global wet markets and their associated health risks while also ensuring their safer promotion.",
