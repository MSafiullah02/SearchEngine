            "text": "Until recently, the primary diagnostic tools for respiratory viruses included direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) assays, enzyme immunoassays, and viral culture. While DFA assays and enzyme immunoassays have a rapid turnaround time, sensitivity is limited, especially in adults. For cultivable viruses, viral culture is clearly more sensitive but it requires both several days of incubation, experienced lab technicians, and it is labor intensive. Molecular testing has greatly improved the laboratory's ability to diagnose viral respiratory tract infections [1]. Multiplex PCR coupled with fluidic microarrays using microbeads or DNA chips (oligonucleotides spotted onto a slide or chips) represents the latest diagnostic approach for the clinical laboratory. Many commercial as well as in-house developed assays exist nowadays which offer a syndromic based approach for the detection of respiratory pathogens. This study focusses on the TaqMan\u00ae Array Card (TAC) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), a microfluidic technology based on singleplex, reverse transcription real-time PCR in a 384-well microfluidic card. These cards are already commercialized for multiple gene expression and micro- RNA expression analyses and have been extensively used in cancer research [7], [8], [9]. For infectious diseases diagnostics, only in-house developed custom-made TAC assays exist to date [10], [11], [12], [13], [14].",

Fifty of these were confirmed by verification testing. Conventional testing identified a pathogen in 3 while TAC assay was negative, of which 2 confirmed by verification PCR (Table 3). Based on these results, viral disease was considered to be present in 75 samples (52.4%) and absent in 68 samples (47.6%). The calculated sensitivity, specificity, cPPV and cNPV of the TAC assay and conventional testing to detect a respiratory viral infection are displayed in Table 5\n. The cPPV of conventional testing and TAC testing was not significantly different (P\n = 0.25), but the cNPV of the TAC assay (96.7%) was substantially greater than that of routine conventional testing (57.8%) (P\n < 0.0001).",

The cPPV of conventional testing and TAC testing was not significantly different, but the cNPV of the TAC assay was substantially greater than that of routine testing. For two out of six samples classified as being false positive by TAC, more than one gene target for the specific pathogen was positive, so it is likely that the verification result was falsely negative due to a lower analytical sensitivity. For the other four results classified as false positive, the median threshold was much higher than that for the same viruses detected by the TAC assay in other samples and confirmed by validation testing. This could suggest very small amounts of virus present in these samples, leading to false-negative verification testing, although a non-specific amplification cannot be excluded.",

The importance of the specimen type is highlighted in several studies. In BAL specimens a diagnostic yield ranging from 3.6% to 32.0% was reported [15], [16], [17]. Soccal et al. evaluated paired nasopharyngeal and BAL fluid specimens and observed an overall viral positivity rate of 29.3% in the upper respiratory tract specimens and 17.2% in the BAL samples (P\n < 0.001) [18]. This study included coupled NTS and BAL samples from 21 patients, and found a similar positivity rate for both sample types (52.4% and 57.1%, respectively).

The exact clinical interpretation of these multi-pathogen screening results is not always easy. When Ct-values are moderate or higher, especially for opportunistic pathogens like CMV, P. jirovecii and Aspergillus species, benign (and asymptomatic) colonization, or contamination should be suspected. Here, carriage of these opportunistic pathogens was likely in 10 out of 17 samples for which the TAC assay found more than one pathogen.

To note, the card used in this study did not include herpesviruses (HSV-1/2, VZV, HHV-6) besides CMV, which could be of possible interest for an immunocompromised patient population [23]. Another advantage is the spatial separation of the 48 reaction wells which allows assays to be easily changed without the need for extensive re-optimisation and validation of a highly parallel multiplex assay. This could aid in the rapid inclusion of novel or emerging pathogens [14]. In addition, the technology uses real-time PCR which generates a semi-quantitative Ct-value, in contrast to many commercial multi-pathogen assays which only offer qualitative results. This tool is decisive for an adequate and correct interpretation of results, particularly in case of co-infections. Moreover, the workflow is simple and easy and the cost per test is relatively low in comparison to most commercial multi-pathogen molecular assays.",
