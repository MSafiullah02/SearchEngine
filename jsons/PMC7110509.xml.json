Main, Iowa State University, personal communication). Most in-house assays for anti-PEDV antibody detection are based on cell cultivated virus, limiting large-scale testing. More recently, an in-house ELISA based on a recombinant N protein has been validated in China (Hou et al., 2007). However, this study did not assess the cross-reactivity of the ELISA with other coronaviruses. In addition, a higher sensitivity and specificity of an S protein-based ELISA compared to an N-protein based ELISA was demonstrated (Knuchel et al., 1992). No cross-reactivity with PRCV or TGEV was detected with the S1 ELISA developed in the present study.",

Therefore, monitoring IgA titers in colostrum and milk samples could be done to ensure that the piglets receive adequate passive immunity.
