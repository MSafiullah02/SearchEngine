The objective is to assist management in anticipating the load of each care unit, such as the ICU, or ordering supplies, such as personal protective equipment, but also to retrieve key parameters that measure the performance of the health system facing a new crisis. The model was fitted with good accuracy to France's data set that gives information on hospitalized patients and is provided online by the French government. The goal of this work is both practical in offering hospital management a tool to deal with the present crisis of COVID-19 and offering a conceptual illustration of the benefit of computational science during a pandemic.",

In the case of the 23 COVID-19 pandemic, it is particularly difficult because large bodies of infected people 24 are asymptomatic. Consequently, the basic reproduction number R 0 factor of 25 COVID-19 is still under active debate. 26 On the hospital workflow side, while there is a large amount of work on this 27 topic [23] , one of the difficulties is to asses the death rate of patients hospitalized at the 28 beginning of the pandemic because the Length of stay (LOS) is rather long and the 29 disease is still not well understood [2, 16, 26] . Every hospital has to adapt to the new 30 crisis as it arrives, so clinical practice may vary greatly from one institution to another. 31 A number of guidelines and great reports have been quickly edited to support the heath 32 community, but it takes time to standardize the healthcare process [3, 5, 13, 24] . 33 Our goal in the paper was to come up with a simple and robust mathematical 34 framework that is easy to use and that supports the management of the patient 35 workflow during a pandemic. Such a model should operate on a relatively limited data 36 set that reports daily on the number of patients admitted for hospitalization, patient acquisition. Much more can be done with the patient electronic records that detail 42 patient comorbidities and chronic conditions, provided that the disease of the pandemic 43 is well understood. 44 We have used a Markov process description of the workflow's graph with probability 45 governing the patient transition from one care unit to another, as well as a simple 46 statistical model of patient LOS at each stage. We will show that with a minimum 47 number of parameters used to fit on the time series listed above for a period of a few 48 weeks, one may start to assemble the information needed to assist the senior 49 management in getting answers and identifying real constraints to reduce speculation or 50 misallocation of resources.",

These resources, i.e. imaging and lab 74 work, are typically shared by all patients in the hospital and therefore may slow down 75 the process. For simplicity and in the absence of adequate data set for validation, we 76 neglect these constraints. Some of the patients who receive medical attention do well 77 with conservative management only and can be discharged home after a few days. But 78 for others, their health condition may deteriorate and those patients will need to be 79 moved to the IMU for higher level of care and/or to transfer to the ICU for ongoing 80 monitoring and mechanical ventilation. The IMU and ICU require extensive supplies 81 and resources. It is often mentioned that the number of available ventilators is critical 82 to ICU functions. However, it is not the only limiting factor: patients under mechanical 83 ventilation need sedation and might be connected to a number of additional systems to 84 deal with organ failures. Once again for simplicity and because of the lack of input data, 85 our model will not take into account these bottlenecks. There are no technical 86 difficulties required to add those constraints in the mathematical model with our 87 bottom up description of the workflow as in [10, 15] . Additional steps can be recovery 88 for patient being well or unfortunately palliative care when the patient is not responsive 89 to treatment. There are many exceptions and singularities to these standard paths: for 90 example, a patient may go directly from admission to the ICU when their condition is 91 too unstable. In some hospitals, the floor might be shared by patients who are 92 recovering from COVID-19 and palliative care patients.Despite this, we will separate 93 these functional units in our model to clarify the workflow process according to what 94 each patient stage requires in terms of resources and time to deliver adequate care. To 95 summarize, a simple workflow graph is created and the main requirement is to know (i) 96 the probability that a patient goes from one care unit to another and (ii) a statistical 97 estimate of how long the patient should stay in each care unit before moving on.

It seems that at the peak of the pandemic in Alsace, the 279 number of patients under mechanical ventilation was less in reality than in the model. 280 One possible factor would be the shortage of available beds in the ICU. On the other 281 hand, the number of deaths did not go higher than significantly expected. A better 282 explanation might be the fact that a fairly large number of patients in critical condition 283 were transferred to hospitals in different parts of the country or neighboring countries: 284 according to local newspaper more than 110 patients from Alsace have been 285 transferred [33] . This seems coherent with our results: the scaling factor for the Alsace 286 data set to get a maximum hospitalization rate of about 50 patients per day is 6; the 287 overshoot on the ICU prediction is about 20 in Figure 6 ; The total maximum overshoot 288 is therefore about 120; considering that the average LOS in ICU (see Table 1 ) is roughly 289 12 days, our model still seems to give an adequate approximation.
