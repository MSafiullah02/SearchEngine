In 1979, Wertheimer and Leeper first reported that there might be a possible relationship between the electromagnetic fields and childhood cancer (Wertheimer and Leeper, 1979). Recent studies have evaluated the effects of the ELF-EMF on cancer (Chen et al., 2013, Repacholi, 2012), reproductive system (Al-Akhras et al., 2006, Huuskonen et al., 2001, Vallejo and Hidalgo, 2012), endocrine system (Crasson et al., 2001, Karasek and Woldanska-Okonska, 2004, Taherianfard et al., 2013) as well as neurodegenerative diseases (Garcia et al., 2008, Reale et al., 2014, Sobel et al., 1995). However, due to different exposure conditions, such as the duration and the intensity of exposure, there remains considerable controversy surrounding the safety of ELF-EMF.",

Besides, Komaki et al. found that ELF-EMF exposure may change the synaptic plasticity in hippocampus (Komaki et al., 2014). Furthermore, it was shown that exposure to ELF-EMF significantly reduced the cerebral ischemia-induced motor hyperactivity in gerbils (Raus et al., 2012). Animal behavior is regulated by the central nervous system. The hippocampus and amygdala have been linked to anxiety-like behavior (Meyer-Lindenberg, 2010), and the hippocampus has also been found to play an important role in learning and memory (Bird and Burgess, 2008). However, the effects of ELF-EMF on animal behavior remain inconclusive.",

As described above, we divided the both groups into 3 subsets and subjected to different behavioral tests, separately. For each behavior, ten ELF-EMF exposure rats and ten sham exposure rats were tested. All the tests were conducted in the morning from 9:00 to 15:00.

All these experiments were recorded with a camera connected to the recording and analysis system.

We employed the Morris water maze (MWM) to measure the spatial learning and memory. The MWM was first reported in 1984 by Morris (Morris, 1984), and was used to evaluate the spatial learning and memory ability. As shown in Fig. 4A and B, during the training stage, the escape latency and the distance traveled decreased from the 1st day to the 6th day in control group, and the trends of the ELF-EMF exposure group were similar. However, the ELF-EMF exposure showed no interaction with the testing time, and had no effects on the performances at each single time point. On the 7th day, the platform was removed, and the locomotor activity of the animals was assessed. The accumulative distance traveled in the tank of the ELF-EMF exposure group was not significantly different from that of the control group (Fig. 4C). Moreover, the time to cross the platform area was measured, and the results revealed that rats from control group remembered the platform area and swam across the area around 6 times in average, which was similar to the ELF-EMF exposed rats (Fig. 4D). In addition, the effects of ELF-EMF on the spatial memory were further detected by the residence time spent in the target quadrant, which showed no significant difference between the two groups (Fig. 4E). Together, these data showed that ELF-EMF exposure had no effects on the spatial learning and memory.",

In 1997, an epidemiological investigation suggested that ELF-EMF exposure for over ten years might enhance the occurrence of anxiety disorders in human (Zyss et al., 1997), which was further supported by Boscolo et al. in a 13 years follow-up study (Boscolo et al., 2006). In rodents, similar effects were observed. It was reported that chronic (4 h/day, 25 days) 2 mT ELF-EMF had anxiogenic effects on rats (Liu et al., 2008). Besides, studies carried out by Del et al. showed that exposure to 80 \u03bcT magnetic field for 2 h altered behavioral patterns in OFT (Del Seppia et al., 2003). However, it was reported recently that mice exposed to ELF-EMF (1 mT) for 14 days can still maintain normal anxiety-like behavior (Alsaeed et al., 2014). In addition, Szemerszky et al. showed that 4\u20136 weeks exposure to 500 \u03bcT ELF-EMF had no effect on anxiety-like behavior (Szemerszky et al., 2010). Similarly, Cosquer et al. reported that exposure to EMF for 45 min did not alter rat's anxiety responses assessed by the elevated plus maze (Cosquer et al., 2005). In our present study, we carried out OFT and EPM to evaluate the effects of 100 \u03bcT ELF-EMF on anxiety-like behavior. Results from both tests revealed that 6 months exposure to ELF-EMF did not influence anxiety level of the animals. The conflicting results between our study and others may due to the differences in experimental conditions, such as the exposure intensity, exposure duration. Nevertheless, it should be noted that our ELF-EMF source was very stable and uniform, which makes our results more persuasive.",

Other studies showed that ELF-EMF did not affect depression-like behavior. For example, study designed by Savitz et al. suggested that ELF-EMF exposure did not increase the risk of depression in electrical workers (Savitz et al., 1994). Analogously, in the present study, we used the TST and FST to observe the depressive state of the rats. Results showed no significant difference between the two groups. The different results among studies may be due to various intensity of ELF-EMF investigated. Moreover, in the current study, we used adult rats as the subjects which excluded the confounding factors (e.g. age, sex and illness).",

In the present study, similar results were observed even though the exposure time was prolonged to 24 weeks. Studies carried out by Li et al. suggested that 100 \u03bcT ELF-MF exposure did not interfere with the improvement in learning and memory capabilities (Li et al., 2014). And this effect could also be observed in head-only exposure to EMF for 45 min (Dubreuil et al., 2003). In contrast, Cui et al. found that ELF-MF exposure (1 mT, 50 Hz) for 12 weeks induced marked oxidative stress in the hippocampus and striatum and impaired hippocampus dependent spatial learning and striatum-dependent habit learning (Cui et al., 2012), which was further confirmed by Maaroufi et al.

Compared to the males, the females have different sex hormone levels (Becker et al., 2005), like higher estradiol and progesterone level. And it was reported that estradiol (Walf and Frye, 2006, Walf et al., 2009), as well as the progesterone (Paris et al., 2014) have anti-anxiety effect. Therefore, further studies are needed to understand the effects of ELF-EMF on behavior.",
