            "text": "Background: Persistent childhood asthma is mainly atopy driven. However, limited data exist on the risk factors for childhood asthma phenotypes. Objective: We sought to identify risk factors at the first severe wheezing episode for current asthma 7 years later and separately for atopic and nonatopic asthma. Methods: One hundred twenty-seven steroid-naive children with the first severe wheezing episode (90% hospitalized/10% emergency department treated) were followed for 7 years. The primary outcome was current asthma at age 8 years, which was also analyzed separately as atopic and nonatopic asthma. Risk factors, including sensitization, viral cause, and other main asthma risk factors, were analyzed. Results: At study entry, median age was 11 months (interquartile range, 6-16 months); 17% were sensitized, and 98% were virus positive. Current asthma (n 5 37) at 8 years was divided into atopic (n 5 19) and nonatopic (n 5 18) asthma. The risk factors for current atopic asthma at study entry were sensitization (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 12; P < .001), eczema (adjusted OR, 4.8; P 5 .014), and wheezing with rhinovirus (adjusted OR, 5.0; P 5 .035). The risk factors for nonatopic asthma were the first severe respiratory syncytial virus/rhinovirus-negative wheezing episode (adjusted OR, 8.0; P 5 .001), first wheezing episode at age less than 12 months (adjusted OR, 7.3; P 5 .007), and parental smoking (adjusted OR, 3.8; P 5 .028). Conclusions: The data suggest diverse asthma phenotypes and mechanisms that can be predicted by using simple clinical markers at the time of the first severe wheezing episode. These findings are important for designing early intervention strategies for secondary prevention of asthma. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2017;140:988-95.) ",

            "text": "Rhinovirus-induced wheezing, atopic characteristics, and severe illness are currently the most important early risk factors for childhood asthma in young hospitalized wheezing children. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Persistent childhood asthma is mainly atopy driven. 1, 2, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] The modified Asthma Predictive Index (API), which is based mainly on atopic characteristics, has been used widely to assess the risk of school-age asthma, regardless of the asthma phenotype. 10, 11 There are studies investigating separately risk factors for atopic versus nonatopic asthma at school age. 8, [12] [13] [14] These studies have shown that classical atopic risk factors and also those considered in the modified API were associated with atopic but not nonatopic asthma. 10 However, the study settings have been heterogeneous, being conducted on birth cohorts, and have not focused on the first wheezing episode. Awareness of which early risk factors predict atopic or nonatopic asthma in later childhood could also provide a novel approach into the mechanisms underlying childhood wheezing and asthma phenotypes. 15 Simple clinical markers would also offer a way to find early intervention strategies to prevent asthma. 16 The development of viral diagnostics has led to good recognition of rhinovirus-induced early severe wheezing as an important asthma risk factor. 1, 4, [17] [18] [19] In addition, already at the first wheezing episode, cross-sectional studies have linked rhinovirus-induced wheezing to atopic characteristics. 2, 3, [17] [18] [19] [20] However, the asthma risk associated with rhinovirus-induced early wheezing has been included in asthma predictive indices in a limited way. These findings have led to a suggestion that asthma risk could be evaluated and potentially modified by targeted pharmacologic intervention at the time of the first wheezing episode. 1, 4, 9, 20, 21 This is noteworthy because it has been shown that oral corticosteroid (OCS) treatment can decrease the risk of recurrent wheezing and asthma in hospitalized children with first-time wheezing affected by rhinovirus, eczema, or both. 1, 4, 9, 18, 20 The aim of this study was to assess risk factors at the first severe wheezing episode in corticosteroid-naive children for school-age (age, 8 years) atopic and nonatopic asthma. Based on the previous literature, we hypothesized that the first rhinovirus-induced wheezing episode predicts later atopic asthma. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [17] [18] [19] 22, 23 ",

Because of the time difference of the 2 cohorts (recruited either in 2000-2002 or 2007-2010), we also adjusted for cohort in the multivariable regression analyses to study whether a cohort was significant in the models or modified the magnitude of the other factors in the models.

Previously, early-life rhinovirus-induced wheezing has been linked to school-aged asthma in birth cohorts. 6, 7 However, the Childhood Origins of Asthma and the Australian birth cohort studies are high-risk cohorts because of including only wheezing children with a familial predisposition to atopic asthma. Therefore the data might reflect a different susceptibility of atopic airways to rhinovirus infections. On the contrary, the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study is a nonselected population-based birth cohort that included healthy infants. These investigators observed that children with early-life RSV-induced lower respiratory tract infections had frequent wheeze by school age, but the risk of wheezing decreased, being insignificant by age 13 years. 30 In addition, there was no link between RSV infections and sensitization. 30 Previous studies on different childhood asthma phenotypes noticed that atopic risk factors from the modified API were associated with atopic but not nonatopic asthma. 8, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] 31 However, their study settings were different from ours because they were conducted on birth cohorts, not focused on the first wheezing episode, 8, [12] [13] [14] included older children, 12 or included no virus etiology of the wheezing. 8, [12] [13] [14] Unlike these studies, we found no clear asthma-reducing effect from breast-feeding or, conversely, an asthma-increasing effect from male sex. 8, [12] [13] [14] We showed that parental smoking predicted nonatopic asthma. 8, 12, 13 On the contrary, parental asthma was insignificant in the univariable model and thus was not included in the multivariable model. However, it was associated with atopic asthma with concomitant rhinovirus and/or atopic risk factors.",

            "text": "This population-based study consisted only of steroid-naive, first-time wheezing children who were mainly hospitalized with severe wheezing (90% hospitalized and 10% treated at the emergency department of a tertiary hospital), one third of whom had asthma 7 years later. Therefore our results could be adapted to hospitalized first-time wheezing children and might provide new perspective when estimating their future asthma risk. B\u00f8nnelykke et al 32 found no specific viral or bacterial risk factors for schoolaged asthma and hence suggested that the underlying susceptibility to triggers instead of the specific triggering agent was the important asthma risk factor. We agree with the host-dependent susceptibility but suggest a trigger dependence so that rhinovirus itself would act as an important early marker uncovering the underlying susceptibility to asthma in atopic asthma-prone children by manifesting expiratory wheezing. 1, 4, 9, 21 Like B\u00f8nnelykke et al, 32 we did not find rhinovirus to be a risk factor for current overall asthma (including atopic and nonatopic), but we did find it to be a significant risk factor for atopic asthma. Concurrently, RSV/rhinovirus-negative wheezing was associated with nonatopic asthma, probably because the children with rhinoviruspositive wheezing had atopic asthma. Infant wheezing might be an asthma risk marker because it often is rhinovirus induced, particularly in older children. 6, 19 However, the rhinovirusinduced wheezing has been included in asthma-predictive indices in a limited way. We suggest that the investigation of virus etiology, sensitization, and eczema status, and especially the combination of these 3, might enable the asthma risk assessment already at the time of the first wheezing episode because rhinovirus-sensitive viral diagnostics are widely available. 1, 2, 4, 7, 19, 21, 33 The underlying susceptibility to atopic disorders and viral triggers might be the true asthma risk factor, and thus interplay between sensitization and viral infections is likely to be involved. 2, 5, 15, 34, 35 The Childhood Origins of Asthma study group showed the chronological order of causality in a statistical model (ie, early-life aeroallergen sensitization precedes rhinovirus illnesses and asthma). 2 However, the slow development of aeroallergen sensitization decreases its value in asthma risk indices during early life, whereas food sensitization is likely to develop earlier, predicting aeroallergen sensitization and future asthma risk. 6, 9, 36, 37 The rhinovirus-associated asthma risk has been explained by increased susceptibility to lower airway rhinovirus infections in patients with pronounced atopic characteristics (allergen-specific IgE sensitization, blood eosinophilia, eczema, maternal atopic eczema, and/or increased IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 responses in airway secretions), damaged airway epithelium, and decreased IFN-a/b/g/l and IL-10 responses in airway secretions or cells. 33 Interactions between sensitizationassociated and innate antiviral pathways might lead to more severe viral illnesses in already sensitized children when a viral respiratory tract infection starts a sensitization-dependent cascade that augments and maintains airway inflammation. 35 The strengths of our study include complete analysis of atopic characteristics and viral etiology and a careful long-term followup. The inclusion rate was high (93%), 100% of the children were followed up from patient charts, and 57% of the children attended the study visit at age 8 years. This study set-up is different from birth cohort studies by being population-based, with all children experiencing their first severe wheezing episode. 31 They were steroid naive; that is, they received no ICS/OCS before or as a treatment for this first wheezing. This is of note because it has been shown that OCSs can affect long-term asthma outcomes. 1, 4, 9, 18, 20 To minimize selection bias, we included children who did not attend the long-term study visit. People adhere to follow-up studies that concern their interests, in our case asthmatic patients. To maximize the objectivity, we regarded children with bronchial hyperreactivity in spirometry as asthmatic patients who were without a proper pediatrician-set asthma diagnosis. This reflects the real-life situation and completes the asthma outcome. To minimize the heterogeneity and make our results more generalizable, we included only children with physician-confirmed wheezing (vs bronchiolitis with or without wheezing in previous studies). 17 In addition, this study has limitations. The sample size was rather small after excluding the steroid-treated patients, and rhinovirus typing was not done.",

This observation could provide a novel approach to the mechanisms underlying childhood wheezing and asthma, prognostics, and potentially different therapies of distinct asthma phenotypes. 15 It would be encouraging to find future therapeutic interventions to prevent asthma, but this warrants further study. 16 Virology and atopic status are worth assessing early in children with severe wheezing to recognize those at high asthma risk and to distinguish the risk between asthma phenotypes.",
