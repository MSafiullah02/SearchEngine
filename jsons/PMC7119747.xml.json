The disease was first reported in 1933 in the Unite States, and has spread throughout many parts of the world including America, Europe and Asia (Yu Dahai et al., 1997). TGE virus (TGEV) was first isolated in 1946 (Doyle and Hutchings, 1946), and is a member of the Cornaviridae family, a group of enveloped viruses with a large, single positive-strand RNA genome (Lai, 1990, Page et al., 1991).",

            "text": "Rapid diagnostic methods for TGE are very important because of the highly contagious nature of the disease. Various methods have been developed for the diagnosis of the disease including virus isolation in tissue culture (Dulac et al., 1977) and immunodiagnostic methods, particularly enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of virus in faeces (Bernard et al., 1986, Van Nieuwstadt et al., 1988) and fluorescent antibody tests (FAT) on cryostat sections of intestine (Pensaert et al., 1968). Virus isolation is slow and the virus is often difficult to adapt to growth in cell culture (Paton et al., 1997). Immunoassays for antigen required fresh clinical samples and may fail to detect virus present at very low levels. Serological methods such as virus neutralization test (Witte, 1971) and ELISAs on TGEV antibody (Huang et al., 1988, Rukhadze et al., 1989, Brown and Paton, 1991, Liu et al., 2001) are used widely but lack advantage in terms of rapid diagnosis because of the time needed for antibody development. Nucleic acid recognition methods including in situ hybridization (Sirinarumitr et al., 1996) and RT-PCR (Paton et al., 1997, Kim et al., 2000, Woods, 1997) have also been described for the direct detection of TGEV RNA. RT-PCR tests are convenient to conduct compared to hybridization methods and increasingly used. More recently, real time fluorescent nucleic acid amplification techniques were developed for detection of disease agents and proved to be rapid and sensitive (Stram et al., 2004, King et al., 2003). However, there are no reports so far on real-time RT-PCR methods for TGEV. The aim of this study was to develop a practical and reliable molecular diagnostic method for TGEV by using real-time techniques principles.",

It includes a single-labeled primer with a FAM fluorophore at the 3\u2032 end in a hairpin structure and a corresponding unlabeled primer, designed to amply the 5\u2032 end of the gene encoding the S protein of TGEV. The configuration of the labeled primer enables the fluorescence quenching capability. When the primer is incorporated into double-stranded RT-PCR product, the fluorophore is dequenched, resulting in a significant increase in fluorescent signal (http://www.invitrogen.com/lux). The target region is located within the large deletion found exclusively in isolates of porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) that is probably a deletion mutant of TGEV (Rasschaert et al., 1990, Page et al., 1991, Laude et al., 1993). Thus the assay that was developed can differentiate TGEV from PRCV, which is important for disease surveillance.",

The LUX fluorogenic primers technology is of high-performance and cost-effective (Invitrogen Press Room online, http://www.invitrogen.com). Unlike the current well known real-time technology that relies on a synthetic DNA probe labeled with two different fluorescent dyes, LUX primers technology does not require an expensive probe so is more suitable for routine laboratory diagnosis. What a LUX assay needs is a specific primer set with a single labeled, self-quenched primer and a corresponding unlabeled one, it is more reliable than the real-time method using DNA binding dyes that may produce potentially misleading results due to the lack of specificity of the dyes. A previous study also indicates that the LUX primers technology is reliable for quantitation of gene expression and the result is similar to the probe-based quantitative assay (Brian et al., 2003). LUX fluorogenic primers can be designed and ordered via online software. (http://www.invitrogen.com/lux).",

The assay was 10-fold more sensitive than the conventional RT-PCR method as demonstrated in the study, while the amount of RNA used in the LUX method is only one-fifth of the gel-based method. Due to the 20 \u03bcl volume limit of the Roche LightCycler\u00ae instrument that uses capillaries, the maximum volume of RNA template for the LUX test is 2 \u03bcl.

The advantage of speed of the LUX assay is more apparent when compared to other routine diagnostic methods for TGE. For example, virus isolation and neutralization tests require several days to declare a negative result, while ELISAs and FAT take several hours, even overnight incubation to finished a test. Furthermore, the LUX assay is closed-tube and one-step technique, which reduces the risk of contamination and reaction variability. This sensitive and specific test complements existing gene methods for the detection of TGEV.
