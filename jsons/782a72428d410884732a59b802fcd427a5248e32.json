The prevalence of HSV-1 ( HHV-1 ) and HSV-2 ( HHV-2 ) in the general population is 65 % and 29 %, respectively. HSV-1 is mostly transmitted through nonsexual contact and is most frequently associated with oral mucosal lesions, while HSV-2 is mostly transmitted through sexual contact and commonly infects urogenital mucosa. Shortly after primary infection, the virus can be found in a dormant state in sensory neurons. Reactivation may occur at a later time. Immunocompromised patients are at increased risk for reactivation with subsequent disseminated disease. HSV reactivation in posttransplant patients can cause pneumonia, hepatitis, encephalitis, and disseminated disease. Oral acyclovir has been shown to be an effective prophylactic and treatment agent for HSV-1 and HSV-2.",

In order to calculate risk of transmission from percutaneous or mucous membrane injury, several factors must be considered, including method of transmission (needle penetration versus blood splash to mucous membrane), needle type (hollow-bore needle such as an IV needle versus solid-bore needle such as suture needle), needle gauge, penetration of needle into patient and healthcare worker, presence of blood on needle, access of the needle to the patient's bloodstream, or whether the needle has passed through gloves or other barriers prior to entering the skin. Personal protective equipment and situational awareness remain the mainstays of prevention. Effective protection methods to minimize risk of transmission of blood-borne diseases include gloves, double gloving if needed, face shields or other eye protection, sleeve reinforcements, knee-high trauma boots, plastic aprons under surgical gowns, and avoidance of blind suturing techniques.",

Furthermore, consent must be obtained before performing testing. Instead, a more accepted practice among many practitioners seems to be testing either high-risk patients or those undergoing higher risk procedures. Regardless of the patient's infection status, universal precautions are standard practice. Upon receiving a percutaneous or mucosal injury from a patient with unknown HIV status, prophylactic treatment is begun and consent for HIV testing is obtained from the patient.

However, if the patient was symptomatic at the time of exposure, a three-drug regimen is commenced for at least 4 weeks.",

In the inpatient setting, it is a leading cause of pneumonia, surgical site infections, and disseminated infections. Risk factors for contracting MRSA include advanced age, prior antibiotic use, previous surgery, and extended hospitalization. MRSA colonization occurs in asymptomatic patients on normal skin fl ora and in the nares. Furthermore, colonization in the nares has been shown to be a risk factor for development of surgical site infections. For this reason, many advocate MRSA screening with eradication therapy through antiseptic decontamination prior to surgery. Screening of asymptomatic patients also allows for more effective prevention of crosscontamination of other patients through implementation of isolation and barrier precautions. Despite these measures, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends against routine active surveillance screening of all patients. VRE Up to 9 % of nosocomial-acquired bloodstream bacterial infections are attributed to Enterococcus , with a signifi cant percentage as VRE. Unlike MRSA, VRE has a low rate of asymptomatic carriers. When colonization occurs, it is most likely on the skin and in the gastrointestinal tract. A higher prevalence of VRE has been found in intensive care, dialysis, and oncology units. The most common mechanism of transfer among patients appears to be ineffective hand hygiene among healthcare workers.

The highest concentration is focused in the less developed areas of sub-Saharan Africa, India, Southeast and Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and Micronesia. Tuberculosis is spread through respiratory droplets by individuals with active pulmonary disease. While most healthy patients exposed will have an asymptomatic and localized course, this infection may remain dormant in pulmonary tissue for years, referred to as latent tuberculosis infection. Reactivation may occur years later in normal healthy patients. However, reactivation is more likely to occur in immunocompromised patients, such as patients with malignancies, HIV, end-stage renal disease, diabetes, and patients on immunosuppressive medications. Active tuberculosis is characterized by chest X-ray fi ndings of infi ltrates found in the apical-posterior segments of the upper lobes and may include cavitations. Symptoms most frequently associated with TB infection include the constitutional symptoms of fevers, night sweats, cough, and unintended weight loss. Diagnosis of latent TB infection is made by tuberculin skin testing (TST), with interpretation of test results based on prevalence and risk of the patient. Active disease is diagnosed through a combination of chest X-ray fi ndings, culture results, and acid-fast bacilli detection from either sputum testing or bronchoalveolar lavage. Treatment is usually accomplished through direct observational therapy (DOT) with at least 6 months of treatment. While latent TB can be effectively treated with one agent, the danger of multidrug-resistant organisms necessitates the use of multiple medications. Patients found to have active tuberculosis infection should be kept in a negative-pressure isolation room with at least 6 air exchanges per hour until clinical resolution of symptoms is achieved with three consecutive negative results of sputum testing. Healthcare providers should wear N95 masks that have been individually fi t-tested when caring for patients with active disease.",
