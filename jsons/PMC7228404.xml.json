The disruption of pharmaceutical industry in China had impact on other countries, where the prices of lifesaving drugs increased due to shortage of raw materials from China. As the Chinese industries had ceased production, the global prices of raw materials like metals fell all over leading to major slowdown in various metal producing economies.\n3\n\n",

Most of the countries had their primary infection contracted from people coming from endemic areas and many countries have stopped flight operations and closed borders. People also started avoiding unnecessary travel, leading to large number of flight cancellations causing major losses for the airline companies. There was overall reduction in oil demand, which led to the largest fall in oil prices in the global market since the Gulf war. The rapid fall in oil prices along with the overall reduction in global industrial production caused major fall in the global stock markets with markets falling more than 20% over a short span of time and the risk of a global 2008\u2010like recession is looming large.2, 4\n",
