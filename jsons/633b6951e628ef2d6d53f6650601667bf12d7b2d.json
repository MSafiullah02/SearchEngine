These patients will have to enter the building through dedicated pathways into an isolation waiting room. Upon completing the treatment, the isolation and treatment rooms will undergo terminal cleaning. PPE will be disposed of in biohazard bins within the room. For those who are yet to start treatment, we will defer non-urgent cases until their period of quarantine or SHN is over.

In our satellite gynaecological and breast cancer clinics at KKWCH and CGH, this issue was mitigated by engaging our surgical colleagues to review recently treated patients. Patients who needed to be seen more urgently were given appointments at NCCS instead. We were also more likely to postpone a patient's appointment if they were reviewed by another specialty doctor recently and were deemed well. Telemedicine for remote consultation is being considered in the event of a prolongation of this global pandemic. Third, although it is possible to defer any untreated non-urgent cases, deferring radiotherapy in category 1 patients (patients with rapidly proliferating tumours) can be detrimental. On a regular basis, the division treats a proportion of patients with hypofractionated regimens, such as in adjuvant radiotherapy in breast cancer patients, the CHHiP protocol in prostate cancer and single 8 Gy for palliative cases. During this pandemic, the division aims to increase the use of validated hypofractionated regimens where possible to reduce the amount of daily hospital attendance, thereby decreasing exposure to possible infection.",

We may have a long way to go before life returns to normalcy. Time waits for no man and for many of our cancer patients delays in treatment could result in detrimental effects, including death. Hence, we need to tailor our services accordingly to ensure that we do not compromise the safety of our cancer patients but also ensure they receive their treatment in a timely manner.
