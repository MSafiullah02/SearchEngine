            "text": "Buildings account for 40% of the world's energy use, and most of the existing buildings are not so energy efficient as modern technology allows [1], [2]. As such, energy retrofitting of existing building services equipment can yield significant amount of energy savings. However, the lack of upfront capital and technological know-how are usually hurdles to undertaking energy improvement projects although the benefits of such works, for example, a substantial reduction in utility costs and improvement of the built environment, are obvious. Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) is recognised as a means to tackle this problem in many countries, including the United States, Australia, Germany, Japan, Singapore and China [3], [4]. The European Parliament defines EPC in the Directive 2006/32/EC as \u201ca contractual arrangement between the beneficiary and the provider (normally an ESCO) of an energy efficiency improvement measure, where investments in that measure are paid for in relation to a contractually agreed level of energy efficiency improvement.\u201d [5]\n. It means that, under an EPC arrangement, energy service companies (ESCOs) guarantee or share the energy savings with building owners. Building owners only make a series of payment to ESCOs when the actual energy savings are materialised. In the case of shortfall in savings, ESCOs will compensate the loss incurred by building owners. To ensure the guaranteed energy saving can be achieved, a proper assessment method on the probability of energy saving shortfall is needed to evaluate such project risks.",

[6] identified the risks associated with energy-efficiency projects and classified them into five aspects, namely economic, contextual, technology, operation, and measurement and verification (M&V) risks. Several risk management approaches (e.g. financial hedging, careful design, proper metering, etc.) were also introduced to mitigate the associated risks in their study. However, even though ESCOs can better manage the performance risks by ensuring system efficiency, optimisation control and better maintenance, the actual energy saving is still uncertain. This is attributed to various extrinsic factors including weather conditions, economic circumstances, as well as occupants\u2019 behaviour, which can significantly affect the actual energy savings. For example, the occupancy rate of hotel may decrease dramatically due to economic downturn, resulting in a significant reduction in the actual energy savings. Therefore, a dilemma is often observed from the ESCOs\u2019 perspective in determining the amount of guaranteed energy savings. On one hand, ESCOs try to mitigate the performance risks by being conservative on the guaranteed savings, but on the other hand, to increase chances of winning bids by offering higher energy saving guarantee and shorter contract period.",

[7] adopted the technique of coefficient of variation (CV) to compare saving uncertainties in different energy efficiency measures. However, some drawbacks were found in this technique, for example, several simplified assumptions had to be made for project comparison and a number of risk factors were excluded in the analysis. Mathew et al. [8] indicated the possible use of actuarial pricing approach to quantify the associated risks for project decision-making. However, this approach requires a large number of actual EPC project data, but the non-standardised project information and poor data quality often hinder the development of a reliable actuarial database [9]. Mills et al. [6] and Jackson [10] suggested using the Monte Carlo technique for quantifying the risks related to EPC projects, but their studies only focused on the illustration of a proposed methodology and no real project data is used to demonstrate the credibility of their findings.",

            "text": "\nFig. 1\nshows the procedure and methods used for quantifying the probability of energy saving shortfall in guaranteed EPC projects. The whole procedure consists of four main steps.I\nDevelopment of pre- and post-retrofit models: The first step is to develop two energy models that can predict representative energy consumption of the building at the pre- and post-retrofit stages. With the two models, the actual energy savings can be predicted taking into account any deviation in the post-retrofit conditions from the baseline conditions. The models should be developed by using a detailed building energy simulation programme, which allows users to input all essential building information, system & equipment specifications, as well as operational characteristics for realistic energy use predictions. The two models should be basically identical except the retrofitted systems and the conditions with significant changes (e.g. change of occupancy). To ensure the representativeness of the models, the models should be calibrated with the measured energy use data. Details of the calibration procedures can be referred to other published literature and guidelines [11], [12], [13], [14].II\nSensitivity analysis: The second step is to identify the importance of influential parameters affecting energy use. In general, the influential parameters can be summarised into three categories, namely \u201cBuilding Load\u201d, \u201cSystem Control and Operation\u201d and \u201cEquipment, System and Plant\u201d. For the selection of influential parameters, attention should be paid to those parameters that are likely to change during the EPC contract period, for example, weather conditions, occupancy rate, operating hours, etc. Some of the influential parameters may be excluded, for example, building height, materials used in building facade, orientation, etc., since these parameters are unlikely to change during the contract period. In some projects, an exclusion clause is incorporated to protest the interest of ESCOs and hosts in case of significant changes in the baseline conditions (e.g. large scale renovation works are conducted during the contract period). Those parameters can also be discarded in the sensitivity analysis.There are three common techniques to conduct sensitivity analysis, namely differential sensitivity analysis (DSA), random sensitivity analysis (RSA) and stochastic sensitivity analysis (SSA) in the field of building energy study [15], [16]. In comparison with these techniques, differential analysis by finite differences (FD) is most widely used because the calculations are easy and there are fewer problems to incorporate into the simulation programme. This technique has been widely used by researchers to determine the most sensitive parameters affecting building energy use [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. The selection of a proper range and interval is essential to obtain accurate results in sensitivity analysis. Therefore, the range and intervals selected should cover the two extreme scenarios with a reasonably narrow interval. Nonlinearity issues should also be studied when the standard deviation of the influence coefficient (IC) is large. The procedure of performing differential sensitivity analysis is presented in the later part of this paper.III\nDevelopment of probability distribution for selected parameters: The third step is to develop the probabilistic distribution function (PDF) for each of the selected parameters. The selection of the representative PDF is critical in this analysis as it is used to simulate the yearly variations in those selected parameters during the post-retrofit period. Empirical data from official database and previous research are used to determine the corresponding PDF for the selected parameters using curve-fitting techniques. Three goodness-of-fit tests, namely the Chi-square test, the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov (K\u2013S) test, and the Anderson\u2013Darling (A\u2013D) test, are performed to evaluate how well the assumed distributions fit a set of sample data [21]. The Chi-square test is used to determine the validity of two or more theoretical distribution models. The K\u2013S test serves the same purpose, but with fewer limitations in application such as a large number of intervals. The A\u2013D test is particularly useful when the tails of a distribution reflect an essential distribution characteristic. The lower the goodness-of-fit value of these tests is, the more representative the assumed PDF is selected. For those parameters without empirical data to determine, a triangular distribution is proposed to be the representative PDF, and the most likely value should be regarded as the baseline condition.IV\nSimulation of possible energy saving: The fourth step is to simulate energy saving taking into account all possible combinations of selected parameters during the post-retrofit period. Monte Carlo simulation is performed to generate a common set of post-retrofit condition data based on the PDF of the selected parameters. Monte Carlo simulation is a mathematical method where output values are randomly generated based on the assumed distributions of the independent parameters. A smooth approximation of the output distribution is obtained with large sample sizes (e.g. by iterating 10,000 simulation runs). This technique has been applied in a number of probabilistic analysis [22], [23], [24], [25], [26] .The Latin Hypercube Sampling method is proposed to generate those random numbers, because it more precisely reflects the shape of a defined distribution with relative small sample sizes [26].\n",

Chan [28] also adopted this morphing method to modify the Hong Kong typical meteorological year (TMY) weather file taking into accounts the effect of urban heat islands. The procedure of this method will be illustrated in the later part of this paper. Similarly, 10,000 input files are required to generate based on the result of Monte Carlo simulation. Each weather and input file represents one of the possible yearly conditions during the post-retrofit period. These weather and input files are run on the detailed energy building simulation programme for the pre- and post-retrofit models to simulate possible range of energy savings.",

A design problem was found in the seawater cooling system in that the central chilled water plant was supplied with seawater, which was discharged from an adjacent central chiller plant for chiller condenser cooling, after the seawater had been used to cool the chillers in the adjacent plant. As the \u201cindirect\u201d seawater supply was at much higher temperatures than the original design level, the chiller plant had been running at rather low coefficient of performance (COP). The poor quality of the seawater also exacerbated corrosion of condenser tubes, causing further lowering of the COP. In order to address these problems, the ESCO and host agreed that the existing seawater cooling system should be replaced with a fresh-water evaporative cooling tower system, and the project was implemented under an EPC guaranteed saving package.",

It is worth noting that the significance of the parameters may vary in different climatic conditions. For example, the ventilation rate is usually one of the most significant parameters contributing to the energy use of air-conditioning systems. However, for the Hong Kong weather conditions where four seasons are clearly distinct, the change of ventilation rate is insensitive to the total air-conditioning energy use on an annual basis because although the greater fresh air flow rate provides a larger rate of free cooling when the outdoor temperature is cool (thus reducing the energy use for air-conditioning during cool winter days), the saving would be compensated by the increase in air-conditioning energy use during hot summer days.",

However, the purpose of sensitivity analysis is to eliminate some parameters which are relatively less sensitive to energy use. The exact average IC value and ranking are not important in this study.

In summer, the mean outdoor temperature reaches up to 28.7 \u00b0C but it can drop significantly to 16.1 \u00b0C in winter [34]. The cooling degree-days (CDD) and heating degree-days (HDD) are 3556 and 426 with a base of 18.3 \u00b0C, respectively [35]. With such seasonal climate characteristics, the annual mean temperature varied from 22.91 \u00b0C to 23.53 \u00b0C within 4 years (from 2009 to 2012), and the differences between the numbers of very hot days (daily maximum temperatures \u226533 \u00b0C) and cold days (daily minimum temperatures \u226412 \u00b0C) for two consecutive years can be as large as 22 days (from 2006 to 2007) and 23 days (from 2007 to 2008) respectively in Hong Kong [36].

In 2003, the average occupancy rate dropped dramatically from 90.5% to 81.3% for the office premises and from 80.2% to 69.6% for the SA premises due to the economic impact of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in that year, and these figures increased gradually to nearly the highest (office: 94% and SA: 88%) in recent years. In this study, the PDFs of occupancy rate for the office and SA premises were derived from the 11 years\u2019 data (2001\u20132011) of the developer's annual reports.",

The operating hours of AC system for office premises in Hong Kong vary from buildings to buildings. In general, the AC operating hours is in line with the office working hours, which is typically from 8:30 am to 5:30 pm in Hong Kong. However, overtime working is very common in Hong Kong. There may be frequent requests for extension of AC operating hours, especially when there are changes of tenants. Since the contract period is relatively long in EPC projects (e.g. 4\u20135 years for chiller replacement), it is reasonable to expect that the operating hours in the first year of an EPC contract would be different from those in the past year. Therefore, the impact of possible extension or reduction of operating hours on the energy saving must be addressed.",

As such, this study was based on the information from Primeoffice to determine the PDF of operating hours. Primeoffice is a property search website with the database of over 1800 Hong Kong office buildings. It provides the building information such as typical floor area, air-conditioning hours and system types (e.g. central AC, split type) [38]. Based on the Primeoffice database, the PDF of operating hours was determined.
