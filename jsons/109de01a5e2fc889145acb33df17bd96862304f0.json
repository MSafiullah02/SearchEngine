Their genome is about 26-32 kilobases long and thus represents the longest know viral RNA genome. The name coronaviruses is based on electron microscopy photographs which stimulated the imagination of early electron microscopy analysts who thought that the viruses have a crown-like surface. Consequently, these researchers named the viruses according to the Latin word for crown, i.e., corona [2] . Until today, all known coronaviruses share a similar genome organization and expression profile of their genomes: 16 nonstructural proteins (named nsp1-16) are encoded by an open reading frame (ORF) named 1a/1b which is located at the 5\u2032 terminus of the genome, followed by the structural proteins (spike/S, envelope/E, membrane/M, nucleocapsid/N) that in total are encoded by ORFs located 3\u2032 of the viral genome.",

The structural proteins E, M, N, and S share the rest of the ORFs of the viral genome while being accompanied by a variable number of the so-called accessory proteins [2] .

The resulting wave of virus discoveries led to another trend in molecular diagnostics in which singleplex step by step methods were replaced with multiplexing technologies able to screen for several pathogens simultaneously. During this time, HKU1 was detected in 2005 at the Hong Kong University (which is also the institution from which the name HKU1 was derived). The isolation of HKU1 was from an elderly patient who suffered from bronchiolitis and pneumonia [46] [47] [48] . Fatal infections occur rarely, and the infections are indistinguishable from other viral respiratory infections. As the other \"common cold\" coronaviruses, HKU is circulating globally [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] .",

The subsequent pandemic that was beginning was halter due to strict hygienic procedures and intervention measures before a worldwide disaster could occur. As a matter of fact, the discovery of this virus was possible solely by the first alarming observations reported by Dr. Carlo Urbani [57] , a physician who was confronted with patients suffering from fever, myalgia, headache, malaise, and chills followed by a dry cough, dyspnea, and respiratory distress; in some cases infections of the liver, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and brain occurred [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] . The overall mortality rate is 9% but is higher with increasing age. To date, the SARS coronavirus has caused only a single outbreak followed by spread to other locations as a result of travel. This initial SARS coronavirus outbreak is now known to be an archetypic zoonosis outbreak of this virus or other SARS-like coronaviruses.
