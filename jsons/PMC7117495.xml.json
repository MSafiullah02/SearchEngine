            "text": "Diarrhea and respiratory diseases are clinically important and cause high mortality in calves (Virtala et al., 1996). Bovine coronavirus (BCV) is an economically important cause of intestinal and respiratory diseases in calves and has also been implicated in winter dysentery of adult cattle (Clark, 1993). Despite differences in clinical disease, it is believed that all BCV isolates belong to a single serotype (Clark, 1993). The genome of coronaviruses is the largest among the RNA viruses (Lai, 1995). Coronavirus has a high frequency of recombination, RNA polymerase lacks proofreading, and defective interfering RNAs are frequently generated in coronaviruses (Lai, 1995). BCV isolates from Canada have been divided into three subgroups on the basis of reactivity with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against spike protein of BCV (Michaud and Dea, 1993). The current modified, live BCV vaccine is not clinically effective (Thurber et al., 1977) and lack of clinical efficacy of the vaccine may be due to antigenic differences among the vaccine and field isolates of BCV. Minor antigenic and biological differences have been observed among BCV isolates from calf diarrhea and winter dysentery cases from the USA (Tsunemitsu and Saif, 1995) and Canada (Dea et al., 1995). To further understand the molecular epidemiology of BCV, 94 BCV isolates from eight states of the USA were compared. We compared antigenic differences on one-way hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test, isoelectric focusing of BCV proteins, and relative susceptibility of BCV isolates to hygromycin B.",

Before inoculation, the suspension was filtered through a 0.45 \u03bcm filter (Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI). The confluent monolayers were washed with calcium and magnesium free phosphate buffer saline containing trypsin (5 \u03bcg/ml). About 0.5 ml of filtered fecal suspension was added on to the confluent monolayers and virus allowed to adsorb for an hour. Minimum essential medium containing trypsin (5 \u03bcg/ml) (Gibco/BRL, Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) and pancreatin (5 \u03bcg/ml) (Sigma, MO) was added. The monolayers were examined daily for 3\u20135 days for cytopathic effects. We successfully propagated 96 BCV isolates in HRT-18 cells (12 from California, 3 from Kansas, 40 from Minnesota, 2 from Nebraska, 1 from North Dakota, 1 from Oklahoma, 8 from Wisconsin, and 29 from Wyoming). All tissue culture propagated BCV isolates were compared at passage 4.",

It is possible that some isolates of BCV are fastidious and do not grow on HRT-18 cell line but will grow in organ cultures (Kapil et al., 1996).

            "text": "It is believed that BCV isolates are antigenically related (Clark, 1993). BCV isolates do not differ significantly in reactivity on indirect immunofluorescent test (Tsunemitsu and Saif, 1995). Either slight or no differences were observed on virus neutralization tests (Dea et al., 1995; Tsunemitsu and Saif, 1995). Because spike protein is the major immunogen that elicits antibodies detected by neutralization and indirect fluorescent antibody tests (Saif, 1993) and elicits a bulk of cross reactive antibodies among BCV isolates, spike protein may not be very useful to differentiate BCV isolates. Minor antigenic variation has been observed among BCV isolates from neonatal calf diarrhea and winter dysentery cases by a one-way test (Dea et al., 1995). Our results in this study support and extend the previously reported findings on HI test using a large number (94) of American isolates collected from eight different states of the USA. None of the previous studies (Dea et al., 1995; Tsunemitsu and Saif, 1995) reported HI results on wild-type BCV or the virus in fecal samples. Results on wild-type isolates may need cautious interpretation because the presence of colostral IgGl and local IgA in feces may interfere with results. On the other hand, passaging of BCV also affects HI. Passage of BCV in cell culture may also affect the antigenic composition (Hussain et al., 1991), hemagglutination activity (Storz et al., 1992), and intestinal replication of BCV (Kapil et al., 1990). It is important to study all isolates at low passage (up to passage 3 or 4) and at the same passage. In the only other American study, samples were studied at different passages (Tsunemitsu and Saif, 1995).",

The Type III antiserum was not high titered and we could not study the two-way HI relationship among BCV isolates. For most BCV isolates, the cell culture passaged virus showed higher HI titers compared to its wild-type virus in fecal samples. When cell culture-propagated and wild-type versions of BCV (WI-17) were compared, they showed HI titers of 1 : 128 and 1 : 2048, respectively. This may be because the hyperimmune serum used in the HI test was produced with a BCV isolate that was highly adapted in cell culture or it could be due to the presence of some antibodies in feces or it may be a unique property of the WI-17 isolate. Typing of wild-type BCV isolates by HI may be useful to study the epidemiology of BCV. Hemagglutination and receptor destroying activities have no correlation with the clinical source of BCV isolates (Tsunemitsu and Saif, 1995).",

However, minor differences were observed in isoelectric focusing of BCV proteins (Fig. 3). Different serotypes of infectious bronchitis virus (Sadasiv et al., 1991) and temperature sensitive mutants of mouse hepatitis virus (Oleszak et al., 1992) differ on isoelectric focusing of spike proteins. Isoelectric focusing is a tedious procedure and needs a lot of careful standardization in research laboratories. In our studies, a suitable point of application of samples was determined by applying purified BCV at three different places: 1.5, 2.7, and 3.9 cm from the cathode. Sample application at 1.5 cm from the cathode was not suitable because the bands were wavy. Application of samples at 2.7 cm from the cathode was found to be suitable for IEF analysis (Fig. 3). We tried three different shapes of the template for the application of BCV protein samples: squares (\u25a0), horizontal slits or dashes (-) and vertical slits (|). In our opinion, dashes gave the most clearly visible bands.",

Because most isolates of BCV were found to be susceptible to low concentrations of hygromycin B (0.5 mM) and because hygromycin has no reported toxicity in cattle, hygromycin B may be a possible treatment for scours caused by BCV. Moreover, relative susceptibility of BCV isolates to hygromycin B provides an easy epidemiological marker to differentiate BCV isolates, into susceptible and resistant categories and can be easily adopted by diagnostic laboratories trying to differentiate BCV isolates. Susceptibility of BCV isolates to hygromycin B can be adopted by most veterinary diagnostic laboratories that have facilities for cell culture. First, BCV is isolated in HRT-18 in the presence of trypsin and pancreatin (Kapil et al., 1996). The virus is then propagated in the presence of hygromycin B to access the susceptibility and the titer of the virus is measured by a HI.",
