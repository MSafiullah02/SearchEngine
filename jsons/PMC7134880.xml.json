The disease burden from diaorrheal diseases are 72.8 million disability adjusted life years (DALY) and responsible for constitute the second leading cause of burden of disease in the world. (WHO, 2004). Furthermore, gastroenteritis is a major cause of malnutrition in infants and young children in developing countries, and it has been reported that 1.8 million deaths in total and 17% of all deaths of children under 5 years of age can be attributed to diarrhoeal diseases (WHO, 2004, WHO, 2007). In a large proportion of these cases, the causative agent has been transmitted through the food chain, including drinking water. It has been estimated that in USA 76 and 14 million persons every year suffer from food-borne disease, of unknown and known causes respectively (Mead et al., 1999, Newell et al., 2010).",

Food may become contaminated with norovirus by an infected food handler whom is not yet aware of being infected. Even with the application of highly sensitive molecular methods the detection of virus (e.g. norovirus) in food constitutes a challenge due to the low number of virus particles needed to cause disease, the high variability of the virus genome and the possible presence of inhibitory substances in such a complex and variable matrix as food. Furthermore, some food-borne infections of viral origin have a long incubation period lasting several weeks (like HEV) and therefore usually no food is available for testing once the disease is diagnosed. Furthermore, as a consequence of the difficulties mentioned above and in contrast to the situation with bacterial food-borne pathogens, there is no efficient monitoring system in place for the detection of viral contamination of food (Newell et al., 2010).",

This very sensitive technique frequently enables the detection of as little as 10 virus copies. Such high analytical sensitivity is a prerequisite for the detection of virus in food, because the infectious dose of several food borne viruses is in that range, but does not overcome the problem with virus being diluted or inhibited in a large food matrices. The samples that are taken and analyzed for virus contamination are much smaller (less than 0.5 g) than what is usual when testing food for bacterial contamination (25 g). Because the number of virus particles required for catching disease is very low and the virus particles are diluted in a large volume of food matrix with a very small sample being analyzed in each PCR reaction, even an extremely sensitive assay may be unable to reliably detect virus contamination. Therefore the virus particles in the food sample needs to be concentrated before analysis is performed to achieve a reasonable sensitivity of the diagnostic procedure.",

The virus is non-enveloped, belongs to the Hepeviridae family and causes acute hepatitis, clinically indistinguishable from HAV. The most common source of infection is faecally contaminated drinking water. In recent years, water borne infections have been linked to major outbreaks. HEV genotype 1 and 2 is endemic in many developing countries throughout Asia and Africa where large outbreaks have also occurred. These genotypes only infect humans, are not zoonotic and there is a strong connection between poor hygienic standards and the spread of HEV gt 1 and 2. Sporadic cases have also been associated with eating seafood contaminated by sewage. In developed countries the consumption of undercooked pig liver, pig or wild boar and deer meat constitute a source of zoonotic transmission of HEV (Tamada et al., 2004, Tei et al., 2004). In the latter case genotype 3 and 4 have been implicated. Recently the transmission of HEV genotype 3 from pigs to humans through lightly smoked sausage containing pig liver and pork was described (Colson et al., 2010). Genotype 3 is present in the pig population world-wide while genotype 4 is present in the pig population of East and South-East Asia. The virus is almost as resistant to environmental influences as HAV. It has been demonstrated that high pressure treatment of food efficiently inactivates feline calicivirus and murine norovirus that was used as model viruses for HEV inactivation (Wid\u00e9n, 2009).",

            "text": "It has been estimated that two thirds of the cases of food-borne disease in USA can be attributed to norovirus (NoV), also referred to as Norwalk or calici viruses, and in the United Kingdom the cost of infections with this agent has been estimated to 24 million pounds per year affecting more than 600 000 persons annually (Anonymous, 2000, Mead et al., 1999). The most common cause of nonbacterial gastroenteritis worldwide is NoV (FAO/WHO, 2008, Hee-Yeon Kim et al., 2008) and it has been suggested that the global incidence of NoV associated disease is increasing. The virus belongs to the Caliciviridae family. The worldwide spread of NoV is believed to be associated to the development of the food market with large worldwide shipments of fresh food, in addition with moderate but inadequate improvements of hygiene control (Koopmans, 2005). This hypothesis is based on the assumption that food-borne illnesses are emerging (Newell et al., 2010), and NoV is the most common cause (Mormann, Dabisch, & Becker, 2010). Foodstuffs that are commonly implicated in NoV outbreaks are raw or poorly cooked seafood and meat, vegetables and fruits as well as ready-to-go food (FAO/WHO, 2008, Kim et al., 2008) g. NoV has been detected in fresh fruits, vegetables, berries, oyster and mussels. During the last decade several NoV outbreaks have been linked to consumption of raspberries (Le Guyader et al., 2004). Outbreaks associated with consumption of raw oysters and raspberries have been found in several European countries and published in Eurosurveillance, (Maunula et al., 2009, Westrell et al., 2010) However, any type of food product is potentially a vehicle for NoV transmission because it may become contaminated by an infected food handler (Hee-Yeon Kim et al., 2008). This virus endures temperatures up to 60 \u00b0C (Glass, Parashar, & Estes, 2009), and mild pasteurization at 65 \u00b0C, used for raspberry puree, may be insufficient if the viral load is high (Baert, Uyttendaele, Van Coillie, & Debevere, 2008). Furthermore the virus remains stable at pH below 3. The virus is resistant to environmental influences and it has been reported to survive for at least 12 days on dry surfaces.",

            "text": "Hepatitis A virus belongs to Picornaviridae, and is an important cause of viral hepatitis that is excreted in faeces and can be transmitted through contaminated food or water between humans only. This virus has been implicated in very large outbreaks, for example 1988 in Shaghai, China where 250.000 fell ill due to this virus (Halliday et al., 1991). More recently, 1600 laboratory confirmed cases occurred in Czech Republic and 2800 in Latvia, during 2008 (Castkova and Benes, 2009, Perevoscikovs et al., 2009). HAV is also relatively resistant to many environmental conditions, physical and chemical agents (Mbithi, Springthorpe, Boulet, & Sattar, 1992), and may retain their infectivity for days to weeks in dried feces (McCaustland, Bond, Bradley, Ebert, & Maynard, 1982). Because of the absence of envelope the virus is very stable. It has been shown that the virus can survive freezing and pasteurization (Koopmans & Duizer, 2004). It can remain infectious in fresh water or sea water for up to 12 months and accumulate in oysters and mussels that filter the sea water. HAV can survive on surfaces for more than 60 days and on hands more than 4 h. Food can be contaminated with HAV in three main ways; at the point of sale, contamination of food during cultivation, harvesting, processing, or distribution or by exposure to contaminated water (Fiore, 2004). Apart from the indirect transmission through contaminated food the direct transmission from person to person is the most important route. Recent reports show that HAV-infected food handlers at the point of sale (e.g. restaurants) or catering constitute the most frequent source of food-borne hepatitis A outbreaks (Fiore, 2004). Although, consumption of improperly cooked shellfish continues to be the major source of HAV food-borne associated outbreaks, many types of berries, such as blueberries, strawberries and raspberries has also been implicated as a source of HAV outbreaks (Calder et al., 2003). Niu et al., 1992, reported investigation of a multistate outbreak of HAV associated with frozen strawberries involving at least 262 persons in 5 US states.",

In the latter case the personal hygiene of food handler is of great importance. Contaminated surfaces are also an important source of contamination. Food products may be contaminated at the source, usually through contact with contaminated irrigation water or sewage contaminated sea water. Shellfish, oysters and mussels that are particularly prone to contamination from sea water mixed with effluents from urban areas because of their ability to concentrate virus and are therefore often involved in outbreaks worldwide. Fruits, berries and lettuce are often contaminated during harvesting, handling and preparation by HAV or NoV infected workers (SCVMPH, 2002, WHO, 2007). In the case of HEV and TBE the product is contaminated by infection of the live animal. In this manner the liver of pigs may become infected with HEV. Other tissues, e.g. kidney, may become infected in the same manner or contamination of the meat may occur during slaughter. Milk and milk products originating from infected goats, sheep or cows may contain infectious TBE virus (see above).",

Other groups have published temporary low level replication of HEV (Emerson, Arankalle, & Purcell, 2005). While this constitutes an important step forward for the detection and studies of HEV, cell culture for HEV is still not a tool generally available to the scientific community or food safety laboratories. Several PCR and real-time PCR protocol for HEV detection has been published. Real-time PCR is suitable for screening of samples and detect genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 with high sensitivity (Gyarmati et al., 2007). This PCR is also suitable for testing various food samples of porcine origin (data not shown). To determine the genotype a gelbased PCR amplifying part of the RNA polymerase gene can be used (Zhai, Dai, & Meng,  2006).",

Before the time of molecular biology techniques electron microscopy (EM) was for a long time the only method to detect NoV (Caul & Appleton, 1982). The advantages of EM is that it allows visualization of characteristic viral morphology, it is rapid and requires minimal sample preparation and have therefore sustained to be a valuable diagnostic tool for NoV infection. However, there is some disadvantages, the technique requires samples with large number of virus particles (e.g. low sensitivity), highly skilled personnel and well equipped laboratory, and can only be used for detection of NoV in clinical samples and not environmental- and food samples.",

Several real-time RT-PCR assays have been described for NoV detection in clinical samples during the last decade. The very high sequence variability of norovirus constitutes the most serious obstacle for PCR assays for norovirus detection. As a result a wide range of sequence variants exists and new ones a constantly evolving. The ideal test should thus be able to detect the broad range of norovirus variant that exists and as well as new variants. Most of the assays target the open reading frame 1 (ORF1) of the RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp) gene, because it is well conserved among the different NoV (Green et al., 1995, Hafliger et al., 1997, Jiang et al., 1999, Nakayama et al., 1996, Vinje and Koopmans, 1996). Katayama et al. showed that the ORF1-ORF2 junction is well conserved and suitable for real-time TaqMan assays (Katayama et al., 2002). Assays based on this region have also been developed by other groups (Hohne and Schreier, 2004, Jothikumar et al., 2005). This assay is able to detect a wide range of noroviruses from genogroup 1 and 2 with an ability to detect as little as 100 genomic equivalents. Commercial PCR assays are also available. However, a comparison of two commercial kits with the assay proposed by CEN/TC/WG6/TAG4 group showed that the commercial kits had a much poorer performance (Butot et al., 2010).",

More and more molecular detection methods such as PCR have been developed during the last decade. Since, cell culture assays are expensive and time-consuming, and molecular techniques offer more sensitive, highly specific and rapid test results for enteroviruses (Hymas et al., 2008, Oberste et al., 2010). Nowadays, real-time RT-PCR is frequently used for detection of enterovirus in clinical samples, and in some extent also used for detection of enteroviruses in environmental samples (Schwab et al., 1995). A majority of the real-time RT-PCR publish is targeting the highly conserved 5\u2032 untranslated region identified by Rotbart et al. in 1990 (Rotbart, 1990).",

They demonstrated that the commercial real-time NASBA assay was somewhat less sensitive then their in-house developed RT-PCR. However, the authors conclude that due to the enormous decrease in turnaround time, the commercial method may be an attractive alternative to RT-PCR (Rutjes, Italiaander, van den Berg, Lodder, & de Roda Husman, 2005).",
