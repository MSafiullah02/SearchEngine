Here, comprehensive computational approaches including drug repurposing and molecular docking were employed to predict an effective drug candidate targeting RdRp of SARS-CoV-2. This study revealed that Rifabutin, Rifapentine, Fidaxomicin, 7-methyl-guanosine-5'-triphosphate-5'-guanosine and Ivermectin have a potential inhibitory interaction with RdRp of SARS-CoV-2, and could be effective drugs for COVID-19. In addition, virtual screening of the compounds from ZINC database also allowed the prediction of two compounds (ZINC09128258 and ZINC 09883305) with pharmacophore features that interact effectively with RdRp of SARS-CoV-2; indicating their potentiality as effective inhibitors of the enzyme. Furthermore, ADME analysis along with analysis of toxicity was also investigated to check the pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness properties of the two compounds. Comparative structural analysis of protein-inhibitor complexes revealed that positions of the amino acid Y32, K47, Y122, Y129, H133, N138, D140, T141, S709 and N781 are crucial for drug surface hotspot in the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2.",

At first, the crystal structure of RdRp was retrieved from the PDB, processed by removing water and complex molecules using PyMOL [27] . After preparing the PDB structures of the inhibitors, they were exposed to the RdRp polymerase of SARS-CoV-2 for analyzing the lowest binding energy and interactive amino acids. The grid box parameters were set to size 80\u00c5 x 95\u00c5 x 95\u00c5(x, y and z) and centre 121.253\u00c5 x 121.376\u00c5 x 120.149\u00c5 (x, y and z). The 2D ligand-protein interaction diagrams were generated by LigPlot+ to find out the involved amino acids with their interactive position in the docked molecule [28] . Discovery Studio and PyMOL were used to visualize and analyze the ligand molecules' interactions with the viral proteins [29] . Additionally, the Protein-Ligand Interaction Profiler (PLIP) was also used to analyze the total number of non-covalent interactions (hydrogen bonds, water bridges, salt bridges, halogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, \u03c0stacking, \u03c0-cation interactions and metal complexes) in protein-ligand complexes [30] .",

Notably, Ivermectin has already been reported as showing inhibitor property in SARS-CoV-19 replications in vitro [51] . Rifabutin and Rifabutin have also been reported for their anti-viral activity against HIV and vaccinia virus respectively [52, 53] . Moreover, the vast number of non-covalent interactions between these screened compounds with RdPd suggests that the protein-inhibitor complexes are very stable. In addition to these drugs, Remdesivir along with Favipiravir which has already been suggested for the treatment of COVID-19, was also found to be effective as the inhibitor of RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 [14] . Although their binding affinity was lower than the aforementioned top five drugs, the binding pattern was almost similar to these drugs.The drug surface hotspot study revealed that the molecular binding sites of all the five compounds were of a similar pattern that could be the hotspot of drug binding to the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2. This study suggested that amino acids Y32, K47, Y122, Y129, H133, N138, D140, T141, S709 and N781 in RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 could make effective interactions with drugs, though this needs to be validated in wet lab. Additionally, pharmacophore was designed using the top RdRp inhibitor drugs along with Remdesivir, which was used further for the screening of ZINC database. Molecular docking analysis revealed that two compounds among the four hits had interacted effectively with the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 which is indicativeof their potential as inhibitors of the enzyme. Although their binding affinity was lower than one control (Remdesivir), the vast number of interactions would give the complex its stability with this binding energy. Moreover, ADME and toxicity analysis of these compounds suggested that they could be used for the development of new drugs to treat COVID-19. However, the study of cytochromes P450 (CYP) isoforms inhibition concluded that there was a possibility that the suggested compounds could interact with CYP isoforms. ",
