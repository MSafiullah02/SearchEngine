Nevertheless, in the current scenario, physicians dedicated to clinical research have begun to feel overwhelmed by such administrative tasks, and it has become difficult for them to understand the appropriateness of certain procedures, to set a limit to the amount of time dedicated to administrative tasks, or even to perform their clinical role with an adequate level of autonomy.",

Another layer of complexity has been added by the incorporation of cumbersome online platforms which require intricate procedures just to access them, and which generate myriads of emails that overwhelm the capacity of investigators and research teams. Exhaustive training courses for administrative processes, which frequently involve examinations, are imposed on clinical research teams to qualify as trial site staff. Frequently, such trainings are requested even from individuals that are not related to those specific administrative tasks. The administrative overload even affects the medical records of the patients, which are frequently\u2014and wrongly\u2014considered as the most suitable place to document administrative procedures, thus distorting their true function. The number of meetings required during the development of trials has also increased relevantly, and once again, the focus of such meetings is often administrative.",

A relevant example are pharmacovigilance procedures, which commonly consist of submitting all the available individual serious adverse events to investigators and documenting their reception, without any intent to summarise, prioritise or classify them. Sometimes, the events even include those observed during screening periods, when the patient has not yet received the investigational drug. This leads to an excess of information that becomes unmanageable and prevents investigators from being effectively updated on the safety of investigational drugs. Another example is the high number of informed consent versions generated in some studies and their complexity, which are difficult to understand by patients,11 and may even generate distrust of the study and the research team.",

For example, some study protocols mandate discontinuation of the study treatments based on the strict application of response criteria, disregarding the medical judgement of the investigators in clinically complex situations (eg, the possibility of maintaining treatment in the case of persistent clinical benefit; or to radically treat oligometastatic progressive disease while maintaining systemic therapy). Frequently, in these situations, the strict interpretation of the protocol prevails, generating clinical interference with the best clinical judgement of the physician, who is responsible for the care of the patient; and potentially compromising the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants, in clear contrast with the main goals of the Declaration of Helsinki and the GCP guidelines. Conversely, many protocols allow physicians to take the final decisions about these complex cases, either directly or after discussion with the medical coordinator of the study, thus confirming the validity of this approach.",
