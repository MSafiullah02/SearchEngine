            "text": "Classical swine fever (CSF) is a World Organization for Animal Health (OIE)-listed, highly contagious viral disease characterized by fever and hemorrhage. Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) can infect domestic pigs and wild boars. CSFV infections were once distributed worldwide. However, it was successfully eliminated in some countries, including the major countries in Oceania and North America and some European Union countries [1]. CSFV belongs to the Flaviviridae family, and is genetically and antigenically associated with other pestiviruses, such as bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and border disease virus (BDV). CSFV is an enveloped virus, and its genome is a 12.3kb to 12.5kb long single-stranded RNA, flanked with highly conserved 5'NTR and 3'NTR [2]. It has a single open reading frame that encodes 3900\u20134000 amino acids and can be processed to produce different viral proteins [3]. Under the action of cellular and viral proteases, this single polyprotein, which contains 3989 amino acids, can produce four structural proteins (C, Erns, E1 and E2) and eight non-structural proteins (Npro, p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B) [4]. The envelope glycoprotein E2, located on the outer surface of the virus, is highly immunogenic and induces a protective neutralizing antibody in a natural host [5]. Beyond that, it has been demonstrated that the E2 protein is a virulence determinant and participates in the adsorption of the virus to the host cell [6, 7].",

However, the use of various codons to encode amino acids is not random, and some are more frequently used, which is called codon usage bias [8]. Some RNA viruses display codon usage bias; however, the degree of deviation varies depending on the identity of the virus. For example, rubella and rotavirus show a strong codon usage bias, while SARS, FMDV and swine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) show weak codon bias [9\u201311]. Mutation pressure, natural selection, gene length, tRNA abundance and RNA structure all affect codon usage bias [12\u201314]. Viruses and hosts can affect the use of codons, which may affect the survival of the virus from evolution, host defense, suitability and immune escape. In fact, synonymous triads are not randomly used, and factors such as natural selection and mutation bias are known to cause this deviation to be equivalent to the use of codons [15]. The study of codon usage patterns in viruses can provide a thorough understanding of their molecular evolution, viral gene expression regulation, and vaccine design that may require high levels of viral antigen expression to produce immunity [16].",

It is considered that RSCU ignores the size and composition of amino acids [21]. RSCU was defined as the observed frequency of a particular amino acid to its standard frequency on all codons [22]. It is calculated using the following equation:\nRSCU=gij\u2211jnigijni\nwhere gij the observed number of codons for the amino acid and ni represents the degenerate numbers of a specific synonymous codon that ranges from 1 to 61 [23]. Normally, a higher RSCU value indicates a stronger codon usage bias. It is considered that no bias when the RSCU value is 1.0; if RSCU is more than or less than 1, there is considered to be a positive or negative codon usage bias [24], respectively. Additionally, codons with RSCU values >1.6 are over-represented and codons with RSCU values <0.6 are under-represented [25]. In this study, it was analyzed using the online software EMBOSS: cusp. (http://emboss.toulouse.inra.fr/cgi-bin/emboss/cusp). Additionally, the RSCU values of swine, which is the host of the CSFV, were downloaded from the codon usage database (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/).",

The ENC was calculated using the following formula:\nENC=2+9F\u00af2+1F\u00af3+5F\u00af4+3F\u00af6\nwhere F(i = 2,3,4,6) represents the mean values of Fi with the i-fold degenerate amino acids. The Fi were calculated as the formula below:\nFi=n\u2211j=1i(njn)2\u22121n\u22121\nwhere n stands for the total amount of the observed value of codons for a particular amino acid and nj represents the observed numbers of the codon for that amino acid [27]. In contrast to RSCU, a lower ENC value denotes a higher codon usage bias. Previously, it was described as an ENC with a range of 20 to 61 [28].If just one synonymous codon encodes the corresponding amino acid, the ENC value is 20, while there is no codon usage bias with the ENC value of 61 [28]. Furthermore, it has been highlighted that an ENC value equal to or less than 35 is considered to be an extremely strong codon usage bias [26, 28].",

However, the correlation coefficient of the neutrality plot was 0.1043, highlighting the relative neutrality was 10.43%. In other words, the relative selective constraint was 89.57% as calculated previously [32, 34]. It is interesting that, compared with mutation pressure, natural selection is dominant in shaping the codon usage pattern of the CSFV E2 gene.",

It is considered that codon usage bias of different species and different genes, even belonging to a virus, is different during evolution [48\u201350]. Additionally, the degree of codon usage is comprised of the following factors: mutation pressure, translational selection, the abundance of tRNAs, secondary mRNA structure, and gene length [10]. Two factors mainly affect codon usage; that is, mutation pressure and selection pressure [51, 52]. Further, in codon usage analysis on some DNA viruses and RNA viruses, mutational bias is a decisive factor compared with natural selection, such as the FMDV [53] and Tembusu virus [54]; however, in the codon usage analysis on PEDV, it was revealed that natural selection dominates over mutation pressure [10].",

Next, were A, G and U, while the nucleotide content analysis decrypted that among the four nucleotides, A%was the highest, which suggested that the nucleotide composition constrains synonymous codon usage of the E2 gene of the CSFV. Additionally, ENC-plot analysis (Fig 1) and PCA analysis (Fig 3), based on the geographical distribution (isolated country and continent), were performed. Fig 1 shows that the value of each 140 independent strains was lower than the standard value, and strains isolated from three continents were clustered mainly in three groups, which was, according to the survey, that the prevalence of CSFV was mainly in Asian [57] and European [58] countries. The PCA analysis (Fig 3) demonstrated that the majority of Asian strains clustered near the origin, and European strains were disparate, which might be due to Asian countries being old epidemic areas, while European countries are actively prevalence areas. Then, the correlation between Aroma, Gravy and codon usage indices and among the 18 frequently used synonymous codons, 10 were commonly used in both CSFV and the viral host indicated the role of natural selection. The two main factors contributed to the codon usage of the E2 gene of the CSFV to different degrees. Thus, the neutrality analysis, GC3s plotted against GC12s, decrypted that GC3s had no correlation with GC12s. Furthermore, the extent of mutational bias occupied only 10.43%, and otherwise the translational selection was 89.57%, highlighting that in natural selection vs mutation pressure in shaping codon usage of the E2 gene of the CSFV, natural selection had a significant role.",
