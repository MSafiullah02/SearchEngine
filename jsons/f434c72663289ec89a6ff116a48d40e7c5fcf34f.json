On 14 March 2020, the Commission adopted \"Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/402 of 14 March 2020 making the exportation of certain products subject to the production of an export authorisation\", 2 temporarily restricting exports of \"personal protective equipment\" to destinations outside of the EU. On 14 April 2020, the Commission announced that it would narrow down export authorisation requirements to protective masks only and extend the geographical and humanitarian exemptions. Governments around the world have been implementing trade-related measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, some trade restrictive, but a number of countries have also called for the elimination of export controls and restrictions on essential goods. As the greater implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on trade are still difficult to assess, the emergency measures taken by affected countries already require legal scrutiny. At the same time, it must be noted that, as noted above for the EU measures, measures around the world are subject to change dynamically in view of the evolution of the pandemic.",

            "text": "In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, EU Member States endorsed \"Guidelines for border management measures\" 3 in order to ensure the smooth passage of goods, particularly food, and medical and health supplies across EU Member States' borders. President of the Commission von der Leyen stated that the measure would only be effective if there was coordination at the EU level. She pointed out that it was important to ensure that \"goods and essential services continue to flow in our internal market\" in order to prevent shortages of food and medical equipment. 4 The guidelines set out \"principles for an integrated approach to an effective border management to protect health while preserving the integrity of the Single Market\". Firstly, the guidelines recommend that, in relation to transport, EU Member States should impose transparent, science-based, proportionate, transport mode-specific and nondiscriminatory measures. Furthermore, the measures should ensure unobstructed transport of essential goods, such as food and vital medical and health supplies. Secondly, EU Member States should preserve the free circulation within the EU Internal Market of all goods, particularly basic need products, such as medicines, medical equipment and food products. No additional certifications should be required for goods. Thirdly, EU Member States should designate priority \"green lanes\" at their borders for freight transport. In this regard, on 23 March 2020, the Commission published a \"Communication from the Commission on the implementation of the Green Lanes under the Guidelines for border management measures to protect health and ensure the availability of goods and essential services\". 5 On 14 March 2020, the Commission adopted \"Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/402 of 14 March 2020 making the exportation of certain products subject to the production of an export authorisation\", temporarily restricting exports of \"personal protective equipment\" to destinations outside of the EU. 6 This Implementing Regulation was adopted with the objective of ensuring the supply of \"personal protective equipment\" in the EU. Prior to the adoption of this implementing act, at the beginning of March 2020, certain EU Member States, such as France and Germany, had already imposed 3 Covid-19 Guidelines for border management measures to protect health and ensure the availability of goods and essential services 2020 ENG&WT.mc_id=Twitter> (last accessed 9 April 2020). 6 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/402 of 14 March 2020 making the exportation of certain products subject to the production of an export authorisation, OJ L 77I, 15.3.2020, pp 1-7 <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legalcontent/GA/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32020R0402> (last accessed 9 April 2020). On this issue, see: I van Damme, \"European Union Imposes Export Restrictions on Personal Protective Equipment\", EU Law Live, 17 March 2020 <https://eulawlive.com/analysis-european-union-imposes-export-restrictions-on-personal-protective-equipment-byisabelle-van-damme> (last accessed 20 April 2020); L Arroyo Jim\u00e9nez and M Eliantonio, \"Masks, Gloves, Exports Licences and Composite Procedures: Implementing Regulation 2020/402 and the Limelight of Accountability\" (2020) European Journal of Risk Regulation DOI: 10.1017/err.2020.28. restrictions on exports of protective medical equipment, such as face masks. 7 As these measures also applied to other EU Member States, they caused considerable disruption within the internal market and irritation among EU Member States. These national measures were removed when Regulation (EU) 2020/402 entered into force. Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/402 introduced an export authorisation requirement for certain specified \"personal protective equipment\" defined in Annex I of the Regulation and including, notably, protective spectacles and visors, face shields, mouth-nose protection equipment, protective garments and gloves. According to Article 3 of Regulation (EU) 2020/402, the Regulation is to \"apply for a period of six weeks\" and will \"automatically cease to apply at the end of this six weeks period\". Businesses intending to export any such products are required to apply for an export authorisation with the competent EU Member States' authorities. Before granting an export authorisation, Article 2(3) Regulation (EU) 2020/402 requires the competent authority to consider the export objective in order to allow, for instance, coordinated EU efforts against COVID-19. On 19 March 2020, the Commission amended Regulation (EU) 2020/402, exempting Andorra, the Faroe Islands, Liechtenstein, Norway, San Marino, Switzerland and the Vatican, as well as certain overseas territories, from the export restriction. 8 The Commission adopted Regulation (EU) 2020/402 and the amendment thereto via an urgency procedure in accordance with Article 5 of \"Regulation (EU) 2015/479 of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for exports\". On 20 March 2020, the Commission published a \"Guidance note to Member States related to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/402 making the exportation of certain products subject to the production of an export authorisation, as last amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/426\", 9 providing certain clarifications, including that exports to the UK would not be considered as exports to a third country. The Commission underlined that the measure taken by the EU was a temporary export restriction and not an export ban and that it was in line with the EU's international obligations. On 14 April 2020, the Commission announced that it had started consultations with EU Member States on a draft regulation to adjust the export authorisation scheme set up by Implementing Regulation 2020/402, which elapsed on 25 April 2020. Through \"Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/568 of 23 April 2020 making the exportation of certain products subject to the production of an export authorisation\", the Commission narrowed down the export authorisation requirements to protective masks only and extended the geographical and humanitarian exemptions to the Western Balkans, as well as to Gibraltar and territories of EU Member States excluded from the EU Customs Union. 10 The new regulation applies since 26 April 2020 and is again limited to a period of 30 days. According to the Commission, the category of protective masks is the only category for which an export authorisation is necessary in order to secure adequate supply to protect the health of EU citizens. In the spirit of international solidarity, Article 2(6) of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/568 explicitly requires EU Member States to authorise exports of emergency supplies in the context of humanitarian aid and to process the relevant applications in an expedite manner.",

EXPORT RESTRICTIONS ADOPTED BY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD Similar export restrictions have been adopted by governments around the world as countries respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, on 18 March 2020, Indonesia's Ministry of Trade announced a temporary export ban on face masks, sanitisers and certain medical equipment until 30 June 2020. 13 India has also banned exports of similar products, as well as of all types of ventilators and anti-malarial medicines. 14 Importantly, it appears that such export restrictions are already causing a shortage of such products in certain countries looking to purchase them.

For instance, El Salvador and Honduras adopted a temporary export ban on certain dried leguminous vegetables, such as red beans, in order to guarantee domestic supplies. 19 Kyrgyzstan implemented restrictions on certain food products, such as wheat and meslin (ie a mixture of cereal species that are sown and harvested together), wheat flour, cooking oil, rice, pasta, chicken eggs, sugar and iodised table salt. 20 On 9 April 2020, the Government of EU Member State Romania issued an export ban of wheat, corn, rice, sunflower seeds and other grains, vegetable oils, sugar and various bakery products. While the measure provided that food products were allowed to be sold within the EU, buyers had to prove that purchased products were not intended for export outside of the EU. The European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Janusz Wojciechowski, declared that the Commission did \"not have any information, which indicates that Romania is facing or will soon face shortages of agricultural products intended for human consumption\" and that the reported measure appeared \"to be not proportionate\". 21 Therefore, and following an assessment that found that the country's food security was currently not under threat, the export ban was revoked on 16 April 2020. 22 The impact of the increasing number of trade-related measures as part of government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic are poised to significantly disrupt the global 15 I Dreyer, \"EU External Border and Air Freight: Next Medical Supply Chain Flash Point?\", Borderlex, 24 March 2020 <https://borderlex.eu/2020/03/24/eu-external-border-and-air-freight-next-medical-supply-chain-flash-point> (last accessed 20 April 2020). 16 \"EU Objects to Romania's Move to Ban Agriculture Exports\", Bloomberg, 11 April 2020 <https://www. bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-11/eu-objects-to-romania-s-move-to-ban-agriculture-exports> (last accessed 14 April 2020). 22 \"Romania Lifts All Wheat Export Restrictions -Interior Minister\", Reuters, 16 April 2020 <https://www.reuters. com/article/health-coronavirus-wheat-romania-idUSL5N2C45XQ> (last accessed 17 April 2020).",

            "text": "Export restrictions are generally prohibited by the World Trade Organization (hereinafter, WTO). Exceptions to this rule are only allowed in specific circumstances under Articles XI:2, XX and XXI(b) of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (hereinafter, GATT). Article XI:2 of the GATT expressly allows \"export prohibitions or restrictions temporarily applied to prevent or relieve critical shortages of foodstuffs or other products essential to the exporting contracting party\". Article XX(b) of the GATT allows measures \"necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health\". Furthermore, Article XXI(b)(iii) on \"Security exceptions\" states that nothing in the GATT must be construed to prevent any WTO Member \"from taking any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests\" in times of \"emergency in international relations\". In view of previous WTO Appellate Body jurisprudence, it appears that the current measures may be justified on the grounds of Article XI:2 of the GATT as temporary measures in view of critical shortages of essential goods. In the case China -Raw Materials, 23 the Appellate Body states that it considers \"that Article XI:2(a) describes measures applied for a limited duration, adopted in order to bridge a passing need, irrespective of whether or not the temporal scope of the measure is fixed in advance\". 24 A critical shortage is defined as \"deficiencies in quantity that are crucial, that amount to a situation of decisive importance, or that reach a vitally important or decisive stage, or a turning point\". 25 The term \"essential\" is defined as \"[a]bsolutely indispensable or necessary\". 26 Considering the current crisis, the WTO Appellate Body's interpretation of Article XI:2 of the GATT appears to provide WTO Members with the authority to restrict exports of food and medical supplies as long as necessary in order to prevent critical shortages. 27 Regarding medical products, WTO Members exporting such products may also invoke the general exception of Article XX(b) of the GATT. Article XX(b) of the GATT allows measures necessary to protect human life or health, provided that these measures \"are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on international trade\". Taking these requirements into account, it appears that undiscriminating export restrictions on medical equipment are in accordance with WTO law, as long as they are strictly limited to the requirements of emergency response. 28 However, the above-cited Article XXI(b) of the GATT regarding the protection of security interests in times of an emergency in international relations does not appear to be a suitable justification for the current measures. Even though the applicability of Article XXI(b) of the GATT in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic is discussed, 29 the WTO Appellate Body typically applies a State-centred definition of \"emergency in international relations\", which revolves around armed conflicts and does not include health emergencies. 30",

Additionally, Director-General Azev\u00eado created a task force of experts from across the WTO Secretariat to monitor the impacts of COVID-19 on trade flows and the overall global economy. On 3 April 2020, the WTO published a report on \"Trade in Medical Goods in the Context of Tackling Covid-19\". 32 The report provides an overview of trade and tariffs imposed on medical goods, considered as relevant in the context of COVID-19.

The WTO has contributed to the liberalisation of trade in these products by means of: (1) the tariff schedules agreed at the time of establishment of the WTO in 1995; (2) the conclusion of the Plurilateral Sectoral Agreement on Pharmaceutical Products; and (3) the expansion of the Information Technology Agreement (ITA) in 2015, which covers certain medical equipment. 34 However, the report also notes that an average of 11.5% tariff is applied on COVID-19-relevant personal protective products, such as hand soap and sanitiser, hand gloves, face masks and protective spectacles, which is partly attributed to the fact that most of these products are not included in any of the aforementioned arrangements.",
