Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales, which also includes the Arteriviridae and Roniviridae (Cavanagh, 1997 \u25b8). Coronaviruses possess the largest genome among RNA viruses, and their replication/transcription mechanisms are poorly understood (Sawicki & Sawicki, 1995 \u25b8; Gorbalenya, 2001 \u25b8). The genome is approximately 27 kbp in length, containing at least eight functional open reading frames (ORFs; Herold et al., 1993 \u25b8). Among these ORFs, ORFs 1a and 1b encode polyprotein 1ab that contains 16 nonstructural proteins (Ziebuhr, 2005 \u25b8).",

Nsp15 has critical functions in viral replication and transcription, although how nsp15 acts in the viral cycle remains unclear (Bhardwaj et al., 2004 \u25b8; Ivanov et al., 2004 \u25b8). A mutation in nsp15 of HCoV-229E has been reported to prevent viral RNA accumulation, suggesting that nsp15 is significant in viral infection (Ivanov et al., 2004 \u25b8). Mutations in the nsp15 orthologue of the related Arterivirus also prevented infections and reduced subgenomic RNA accumulation (Posthuma et al., 2006 \u25b8).",

The crystal structures of these two homologous nsp15s have been determined previously (Xu et al., 2006 \u25b8; Ricagno et al., 2006 \u25b8), demonstrating that nsp15 is a hexamer formed by a dimer of trimers (PDB entries 2gth and 2h85). In addition, the structure of the monomeric nsp15 in SARS-CoV was determined through an N-terminal domain truncation (PDB entry 2ozk; Joseph et al., 2007 \u25b8). Hexamers have been considered to be the fully active form, while monomers lose the enzymatic activity owing to a lack of RNA-binding ability (Bhardwaj et al., 2004 \u25b8; Joseph et al., 2007 \u25b8). In previous investigations on nsp15s, even though several site-directed mutations were made, trimers only existed in the transition state between hexamers and monomers. Stable trimeric nsp15 has not been obtained before; thus, its structure and enzymatic activity have not yet been reported (Ricagno et al., 2006 \u25b8; Joseph et al., 2007 \u25b8; Xu et al., 2006 \u25b8). In this work, trimeric nsp15 from HCoV-229E was successfully obtained by mutating Ile26 and Asn52 to alanine, and the expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction studies of this trimeric nsp15 are described.",

The resulting PCR product was digested with BamHI and XhoI, and was cloned into pGEX-6p-1 vector (GE Healthcare; Table 1 \u25b8). The plasmids for the mutants were obtained by PCR using a mutagenesis kit (Transgen, People\u2019s Republic of China). The validity of the constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing (AuGCT, People\u2019s Republic ofChina). Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) cells (Novagen) carrying the recombinant plasmid were grown to an OD600 of 0.6 in 1 l Luria\u2013Bertani broth (LB) medium containing 100 mg l\u22121 ampicillin, and the expression of wild-type (wt) nsp15 (or the mutants) was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl \u03b2-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 289 K overnight. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000g for 20 min. The harvested cell paste was resuspended in lysis buffer consisting of 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and was disrupted by sonication. The resulting cell suspension was centrifuged at 18 000g for 40 min at 4\u00b0C and the supernatant was applied onto a glutathione-Sepharose FF column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. Unbound proteins were washed out with lysis buffer. The GST tag was cleaved by digestion with 10 units ml\u22121 PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare) at 277 K overnight. The cleaved proteins in the flowthrough fraction were collected and were further purified on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) calibrated with the following molecular-mass standards: blue dextran 2000 (2 MDa), thyroglobulin (660 000 Da), ferritin (440 000 Da), catalase (232 000 Da), aldolase (140 000 Da), BSA (67 000 Da) and chymotrypsinogen (25 000 Da). The eluted fraction was mixed with 20 ml stock buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM Mg2+) and the protein was ultrafiltered to 8 mg ml\u22121 for subsequent crystallization. The purity of the protein was monitored by 12.0% SDS\u2013PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fig. 1 \u25b8). The concentration of the protein was estimated by measurement of the UV absorbance at 280 nm; the absorbance coefficient used was 1.22.",

            "text": "In order to better understand the structure and assembly of nsp15 from HCoV-229E, wt nsp15 and several mutants were investigated. The mutants were made based on structural analysis of homologous nsp15s from SARS-CoV and MHV. The mutants were I26A, I26A/N52A and L2A/E3A, which all focused on the key residues involved in the interactions between trimers. They were expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity by glutathione affinity column chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography. The size-exclusion chromatography suggested that the nsp15 I26A/N52A mutant was present in a trimeric form, which eluted at approximately 13.0 ml. However, the other two mutants failed to disrupt the formation of hexamers as judged by their elution at approximately 11.8 ml, which is representative of hexamers (Fig. 4 \u25b8). For SARS-CoV and MHV, two size-exclusion chromatography peaks indicate that their nsp15 proteins form hexamers as well as monomers (Ricagno et al., 2006 \u25b8; Xu et al., 2006 \u25b8). Although several mutations were made to attempt to destroy the trimer\u2013trimer interactions of nsp15 in SARS-CoV, only monomers could be observed instead of trimers (Bhardwaj et al., 2008 \u25b8). Here, the HCoV-229E nsp15 mutant I26A/N52A resulted in trimeric nsp15, and this trimeric form was also confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation (Fig. 5 \u25b8). The trimeric nsp15 indicated that the interaction between Ille26 and Asn52 was crucial for the formation of the hexamer. Furthermore, the production of stable trimers is a prerequisite for further research on the structure and enzymatic activity.",

Structure solution was obtained by molecular replacement using Phaser (Terwilliger, 2001 \u25b8); the search template used was a trimeric nsp15 model from SARS-CoV (PDB entry 2gth). According to the initial phasing, there are two trimers, as opposed to a hexamer, packing in the asymmetric unit in a head-to-head manner. Further refinement and model building are under way.
