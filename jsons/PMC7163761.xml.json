            "text": "Despite substantial advances in medical management, sepsis continues to represent a leading cause of illness and death in horses (Hoffman et al. 1992; Cohen et al. 1994; Werners et al. 2005; Peek et al. 2006). The body's systemic inflammatory response to microbial invasion can lead to rapid deterioration despite pathogen control, which presents a challenge to equine practitioners. Several terms have been used to describe sepsis and its sequela. The American College of Chest Physicians and the Society of Critical Care Medicine published a consensus report of definitions in 1992 adopted by veterinary specialists in order to provide accuracy and consistency among practitioners (Bone et al. 1992). The term systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is used to describe systemic inflammation that may be caused by infectious agents (e.g. bacteria, fungi, viruses, etc.) or noninfectious causes (e.g. trauma, burns, toxins, acidosis, etc.). When SIRS is the result of infection, it is termed sepsis. The most common infectious agents associated with sepsis are bacteria. If bacteria are present in the blood, the term bacteraemia is used. Although it has been suggested that septicaemia be eliminated from current usage because it does not adequately describe the spectrum of organisms that may invade the blood, it is defined as bacterial infection in the blood in conjunction with SIRS. A frequent complication of SIRS is the development of organ system dysfunction which is called multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The term severe sepsis is defined as sepsis associated with hypoperfusion, hypotension or organ dysfunction. If a patient with severe sepsis is hypotensive despite adequate fluid resuscitation, the term septic shock is used. Finally, a syndrome of immunosuppression that may result secondary to SIRS is compensatory anti\u2010inflammatory response syndrome (CARS) and may lead to leucocyte anergy and increased susceptibility to infection.",

            "text": "Endotoxaemia, defined as the presence of Gram\u2010negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) within the blood, is a common finding in bacteraemic neonatal foals and is a common sequela of equine gastrointestinal disease, pleuropneumonia and metritis (King and Gerring 1988; Steverink et al. 1994; Ryu et al. 2004; Vinogradov et al. 2008; Hilton and Pusterla 2009; Lopes et al. 2010; Senior et al. 2011). By definition, dead Gram\u2010negative bacteria or fragmented LPS in the blood is not considered \u2018infection,\u2019 but given the similar proinflammatory response, endotoxaemia is considered a subset of sepsis. Horses are exquisitely sensitive to the presence of endotoxin in the blood. Once in the blood stream, LPS may bind circulating LPS\u2010binding protein (LBP), which as a complex then binds the CD14 molecule on monocytic cells. The resulting complex activates toll\u2010like receptor 4 (TLR4) and LPS is transferred to myeloid differentiation protein\u20102 (MD2) (Werners and Bryant 2012). Pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including LPS, may be recognised by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) other than TLR4, with each recognising specific ligands (Werners and Bryant 2012). Activation of PRRs by PAMPs triggers intracellular signalling which results in increased transcription of several proinflammatory cytokines. These cytokines include tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1), interleukins (IL)1, IL6, IL8 and IL12 (Pernerstorfer et al. 1999). Experimental intravenous (i.v.) administration of LPS to horses increases gene expression of IL1, IL6 and IL8 and TNF\u03b1, and also increases the concentration of IL6 and TNF\u03b1 proteins in the circulation (MacKay et al. 1991; MacKay and Lester 1992; Nieto et al. 2009). In addition, gene expression of TLR4 and MD2 in equine peripheral WBC has been shown to increase following endotoxin stimulation (Fossum et al. 2012).",

            "text": "Proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u03b1, IL1 and IL6 induce release of acute phase proteins from the liver. These include fibrinogen, C\u2010reactive protein, mannose\u2010binding lectin, complement, serum amyloid A, haptoglobin, cerruloplasmin and vasoactive amines. Complement and IL8 induce neutrophil chemotaxis which results in neutropenia. Simultaneous with WBC activation, endotoxin binds to complement proteins to activate the lectin\u2010dependent and alternative complement pathways, which further promote inflammation through production of peptide products. Intravascular coagulation is initiated primarily through tissue factor activation. The net effects of proinflammatory cytokines, acute phase proteins, procoagulants and vasoactive mediators are hypoperfusion and subsequent tissue hypoxia. Therefore, a relatively common sequela associated with equine endotoxaemia is MODS, which may manifest as laminitis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (Parsons et al. 2007). Manifestations of sepsis in neonatal foals and mature (non\u2010neonatal) horses will be discussed separately, followed by diagnosis, treatment, MODS and prognosis of sepsis in equids of all ages.",

            "text": "A major risk factor for development of sepsis is failure of passive transfer (FPT) (Jeffcott and Jeffcott 1974; Peek et al. 2006). The \u2018open\u2019 gut that persists for up to 24 h of age allows absorption of bacteria through specialised enterocytes that, if unchecked by immunoglobulin G (IgG), may overwhelm the innate immune response and cause sepsis. Thus, bacterial translocation typically results in Gram\u2010negative bacteraemia and endotoxaemia (Koterba et al. 1984; Wilson and Madigan 1989; Marsh and Palmer 2001; Borchers et al. 2012). Other routes of microbial invasion include the umbilicus, respiratory and genitourinary tracts and disrupted skin or mucosal barriers. Poor sanitary conditions and improper umbilical care are also risk factors for development of neonatal sepsis. Early detection of FPT is important in reducing morbidity and mortality in neonatal foals and is typically done using a stall\u2010side commercial IgG test (SNAP Foal IgG Test Kit)1. This test is highly sensitive for detection of FPT and provides rapid results but is not very specific. In other words, FPT (<8 g/l IgG) is likely to be detected by the SNAP test but many foals with IgG <8 g/l IgG do not have FPT (Metzger et al. 2006). Radial immunodiffusion testing provides a more accurate and specific measurement of blood IgG but cost and turnaround time make this test less practical (Metzger et al. 2006).",

Abnormal perinatal respiratory development, perinatal hypoxia or immunocompromise may predispose or exacerbate septic pneumonia in some foals (Paradis 1989). In one study, a diagnosis of SIRS was associated with increased pulmonary infiltrates in the caudodorsal lung fields of affected foals, which may have reflected vascular leakage in regions of increased blood flow (Stewart et al. 1987; Bedenice et al. 2003). In a retrospective evaluation of 65 foals with sepsis, 19% had clinical evidence of pneumonia (Gayle et al. 1998). It is important to note that in many septic foals, respiratory rate and lung auscultation are normal despite pulmonary involvement. Several studies have documented a higher incidence of respiratory disease detected at necropsy compared to ante mortem findings in septic foals (Koterba et al. 1984; Raisis et al. 1996a).",

            "text": "Equine gastrointestinal disease that results in ischaemia or inflammation may lead to loss of mucosal integrity and subsequent migration of bacteria and LPS into the circulation. It has been shown that up to 29% of horses presenting for colic to a referral institution had detectable LPS in the circulation and that increased levels of blood LPS were positively correlated with mortality (Senior et al. 2011). Endotoxaemia can occur secondary to infectious enterocolitis or strangulating gastrointestinal lesions that lead to peritonitis. Common infectious causes of colitis in adult horses include equine neorickettsiosis (Potomac horse fever), Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile and Salmonella spp. Bacteraemia caused by Neorickettsia risticii can induce SIRS in cases of equine neorickettsiosis. In a retrospective study investigating factors associated with survival in 44 horses with equine neorickettsiosis, severity of colitis that was reflected by electrolyte loss and prerenal azotaemia was predictive of survival (Bertin et al. 2013). C. perfringens type C and, less commonly, type A, can be a primary cause of enterocolitis in adult horses, while C. difficile is often associated with antimicrobial use (Feary and Hassel 2006). Faecal samples from 43 adult horses with clinical signs of acute colitis were cultured for anaerobic bacteria; C. perfringens and C. difficile were isolated in 40 and 5.4% of cases, respectively, while Salmonella spp. were not cultured in any (Gohari et al. 2014). Salmonella spp. (may) be transiently shed in faeces of normal horses, but can cause enterocolitis in susceptible animals (Schott et al. 2001; Ernst et al. 2004). Equine coronavirus is a newly emerging infectious disease in the United States that causes anorexia, lethargy, fever and, occasionally, diarrhoea. Although the mortality rate is low in affected adult horses, deterioration of clinical signs may be associated with gastrointestinal translocation of bacteria and subsequent sepsis (Pusterla et al. 2013). Equine duodenitis\u2010proximal jejunitis (DPJ) is an inflammatory condition of the small intestine that often results in severe endotoxaemia\u2010associated SIRS (Davis et al. 2003). Distinguishing DPJ from a surgical small intestinal lesion can be challenging, as strangulating obstructive lesions can cause similar clinical signs including SIRS secondary to endotoxaemia, gastric reflux and colic. In a prospective study, 14% of horses with strangulating small intestinal lesions requiring resection and anastomosis were bacteraemic, although this percentage may have been falsely low given the poor sensitivity of blood culture (Hurcombe et al. 2012).",

Anaerobic species most commonly isolated include Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium sp. (Sweeney et al. 1991). The survival rate for horses with aerobic bacterial infections is higher than that of horses with anaerobic or mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections and may be affected, in part, by the presence and severity of sepsis (Sweeney et al. 1985, 1991).",

If bacteria are absorbed into the circulation from the infected uterus, sepsis can result. In addition to signs of SIRS, horses with septic metritis may also exhibit red\u2010brown, foetid discharge from the cervix or vulva.

The definition of SIRS in people is based on physiological parameters including body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate and abnormal leucocyte count (Bone et al. 1992). The presence of 2 of the following abnormalities is considered diagnostic for SIRS:1) Hyperthermia or hypothermia.2) Tachycardia.3) Tachypnoea or hyperventilation.4) Leucopenia, leucocytosis, or >10% band neutrophils.\n",

However, definitive diagnosis of bacterial sepsis is obtained through microbial culture. Unfortunately, culture and antimicrobial susceptibility results are usually not available until more than 48 h after admission and consequently, empirical treatment is often instituted prior to diagnosis. Early antimicrobial treatment, although warranted in suspect cases, may impede the sensitivity of culture as a diagnostic test for sepsis. In addition, false negative blood culture results may be due to low numbers of circulating bacteria or a relatively low volume of blood for culture and varying blood culture systems may yield inconsistent results (Wilson and Madigan 1989). A weighted sepsis scoring system is currently used as a diagnostic tool for sepsis in neonatal foals, but demonstrates a relatively low sensitivity and specificity (Brewer and Koterba 1988; Corley and Furr 2003). Although clinicopathological findings such as leucopenia, neutropenia with a degenerative left shift and neutrophil toxicity have been associated with sepsis in horses, lack of test specificity limits their usefulness in contributing to a diagnosis of sepsis (Hurcombe et al. 2008). However, with regard to predicting survival, white blood cell (WBC) counts (>6.0 \u00d7 109/l) and neutrophil counts (>4.0 \u00d7 109/l) are significantly associated with increased odds of survival in septic foals (Gayle et al. 1998). Elevated plasma fibrinogen has been associated with in utero infection and is associated with nonsurvival, but is also a nonspecific indicator of inflammation (Koterba et al. 1984). Hyperfibrinogenaemia was observed in 89% of neonatal foals with confirmed meningoencephalitis (Viu et al. 2012). Increased blood L\u2010lactate concentration and persistence of hyperlactataemia are associated with nonsurvival in horses with systemic illness, but a clear association with bacteraemia is lacking (Castagnetti et al. 2010). Evaluation of blood L\u2010lactate concentration at a single time point is a poor predictor of sepsis (Borchers et al. 2012), but is consistently elevated in foals with meningoencephalitis (Viu et al. 2012). Cytokine profiles in septic horses have varied widely among studies and are not currently utilised for diagnosis or prognostication of equine sepsis in neonatal foals (Pusterla et al. 2006; Gold et al. 2007; Burton et al. 2009; Castagnetti et al. 2012).",

Serum amyloid A has been advocated as a useful biomarker in the diagnosis of equine neonatal sepsis, but periparturient events may influence SAA concentrations (Chavatte et al. 1992; Stoneham et al. 2001; Duggan 2008; Paltrinieri et al. 2008). Initial studies in neonatal foals suggest that quantification of SAA can differentiate infectious from noninfectious illness (Chavatte et al. 1992; Stoneham et al. 2001). Concentrations of SAA have been shown to be increased in adult horses with bacterial pneumonia, influenza and septic arthritis (Hulten et al. 1999; Hulten and Demmers 2002; Jacobsen et al. 2006). In one study, clinically abnormal adult horses demonstrated a 20.5\u2010fold increase in median SAA compared to a relatively low (<2\u2010fold) increase in median WBC count and median plasma fibrinogen concentration (Belgrave et al. 2013).

Binding of CD14 to the LPS/LPS\u2010binding protein complex triggers activation of TLR4, which initiates transcription of proinflammatory cytokines. A soluble form of CD14 (sCD14) can be found in serum and is thought to be a product of membrane\u2010bound CD14 released from cell surfaces (Bazil et al. 1986; Wagner et al. 2013). Soluble CD14 can bind circulating LPS and transfer LPS to plasma lipoproteins, thereby serving as an anti\u2010inflammatory protein (Kitchens and Thompson 2005). Elevated serum concentrations of sCD14 have been reported in man with acute inflammation and sepsis and are likely a reflection of LPS\u2010induced cell activation (Kitchens et al. 2001). In one study, sCD14 was found to be elevated in serum of 15 septic foals compared to 15 healthy foals (Wagner et al. 2013). In a second study, sCD14 was found to be significantly increased in serum from 55 adult horses with diseases commonly associated with endotoxaemia compared to 23 healthy controls; however, sCD14 concentrations did not correlate with outcome (Silva et al. 2013).",

This peptide facilitates tissue perfusion through potent vasodilatory and inotropic effects (Nishikimi et al. 2003; Gibbons et al. 2007) and has been shown to increase rapidly following the onset of sepsis in man and rodents (Wang et al. 1998; Koo et al. 2001). Adrenomedullin is thought to contribute to hyperdynamic circulation characterised by decreased mean arterial blood pressure, decreased systemic vascular resistance and compensatory increases in cardiac output and stroke volume (Wang et al. 1998; Koo et al. 2001). In man, plasma AM levels increase with various clinical diseases, with up to 50\u2010fold increases observed in septic patients (Ueda et al. 1999; Gibbons et al. 2007; Oncel et al. 2012). Although AM has not been evaluated in adult horses, a recent study investigated plasma AM concentration in 3 groups of neonatal foals: septic, sick nonseptic and healthy controls (Toth et al. 2014). Ninety critically ill foals (42 septic, 48 sick nonseptic) and 61 healthy foals were included in the study. There was a 6\u2010fold increase in the median plasma AM concentration in critically ill foals compared to healthy foals (P<0.0001), but AM levels were not associated with sepsis (P = 0.71) or survival (P = 0.051). Plasma AM concentrations of 0.041 ng/ml provided a test sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 54% to predict illness, suggesting that plasma AM concentration may serve as a marker of health in foals.",

Early recognition of sepsis and prompt antimicrobial drug treatment are critical for a successful outcome. Initially, a broad\u2010spectrum bactericidal approach should be based on prediction of likely organisms (given the hospital or region's recent history) and should not be delayed pending microbial culture results if there is a high suspicion of sepsis. Based on several antimicrobial sensitivity studies in foals with bacteraemia, the current recommendation for empirical treatment of suspected neonatal foal sepsis is a combination of an aminoglycoside (amikacin: 21\u201325 mg/kg bwt i.m. or i.v. q. 24 h; gentamicin: 6.6 mg/kg bwt i.m. or i.v. q. 24 h) with penicillin G (sodium/potassium: 22,000\u201344,000 iu/kg bwt i.v. q. 6 h; procaine: 22,000\u201344,000 iu/kg bwt i.m. q. 12 h), ampicillin sodium (15\u201350 mg/kg bwt i.m. or i.v. q. 6\u20138 h), or a third\u2010 generation cephalosporin (ceftiofur: 2\u20135 mg/kg bwt i.m. or i.v., q. 6\u201312 h) (Wilson and Madigan 1989; Marsh and Palmer 2001; Sanchez 2005; Theelen et al. 2014a). Targeted therapy should be implemented based on sensitivity results typically available 4\u20137 days after submission. Aminoglycosides should be avoided in foals with hypovolaemia or nephropathy and fluoroquinolones (e.g. enrofloxacin: 5\u20137 mg/kg per os or i.v. q. 24 h) should be reserved for those cases with resistance to other antimicrobials given the risk of arthropathy (Davenport et al. 2001). Appropriate antimicrobial treatment of sepsis in mature horses is based on culture and antimicrobial susceptibility in cases of pleuropneumonia and metritis, while oxytetracycline (6.6\u201315 mg/kg bwt i.v. q. 12\u201324 h) is considered the treatment of choice for horses suspected of having equine neorickettsiosis (Bertin et al. 2013).

Due to the relatively high cost of plasma (currently \u223c$150/l), synthetic colloids may be the only affordable choice for some owners.

In a retrospective study comparing 73 hospitalised horses that developed laminitis with 146 that did not, the diagnosis of endotoxaemia was found to be the only factor significantly associated with laminitis (Parsons et al. 2007). Although hypoxia and laminar microthrombi formation are suspected to be involved in the pathophysiology of endotoxin\u2010mediated laminitis, several attempts to induce laminitis by experimental infusion of LPS have not been successful (Turek et al. 1985; Ward et al. 1987; MacKay et al. 1991; MacKay and Lester 1992; Tadros and Frank 2012). Laminitis may also be induced by hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia (insulin resistance) (de Laat et al. 2012; Knowles et al. 2012). In a retrospective analysis of 44 horses diagnosed with equine neorickettsiosis, laminitis was present in 38% of horses, 88% of which were affected in all 4 feet (Bertin et al. 2013).

Systemic inflammation associated with sepsis can cause widespread damage to the endothelium, which promotes coagulation. This hypercoagulable state can lead to microthrombi formation, ischaemia and MODS (Taylor et al. 2001). As coagulation factors are consumed, the patient enters a hypocoagulable phase characterised by excessive bleeding (Epstein 2014). In human patients with sepsis, administration of heparin is recommended for those patients in a hypercoagulable state (Zimmerman 2004). Heparin has been shown to decrease the incidence of laminitis and increase survival in adult horses with hypercoagulable DIC, but heparin may increase bleeding in the hypocoagulable state; thus, its use in sepsis is controversial as these states may not be easily decipherable (Welch et al. 1992; Cohen et al. 1994). Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH; dalteparin) has reportedly fewer side effects than unfractionated heparin in horses, with the recommended dosage of 50 iu/kg bwt q. 24 h SC (Feige et al. 2003). The incidence of DIC in septic foals can reach up to 50% and is associated with nonsurvival (Armengou et al. 2008; Bentz et al. 2009). Neonatal foals require a higher dosage of LMWH than adults to achieve anticoagulant activity blood levels and dosing at 100 iu/kg bwt q. 24 h subcutaneously appeared safe in a clinical study (Armengou et al. 2010). Hyperimmune equine plasma containing coagulation factors may be beneficial in treating or preventing the hypocoagulable state of DIC (Welch et al. 1992).

Survival rates in septic neonatal foals are highly variable, with reported short\u2010term survival rates from 10 to 70% (Baker et al. 1986; Hoffman et al. 1992; Raisis et al. 1996b; Gayle et al. 1998; Stewart et al. 2002; Slack et al. 2005; Peek et al. 2006; Corley et al. 2007). However, outcome has improved significantly over time, which is likely due to early detection and treatment of at risk foals. In general, it is appropriate to quote a prognosis for short\u2010term survival of approximately 50\u201360%, but individual factors will greatly influence the outcome. Foals with Gram\u2010negative or mixed organism infections are more likely to die than foals with Gram\u2010positive infection (Barton et al. 1998; Corley et al. 2007). Odds of survival also decrease if septic arthritis is present, or if band neutrophils or serum creatinine concentration are significantly elevated (Sanchez et al. 2008). Neonatal foals with confirmed meningoencephalitis have a poor prognosis, with one study reporting an 11% survival rate despite aggressive treatment (Viu et al. 2012). There are few studies regarding long\u2010term outcome in septic foals. One study reported that Thoroughbred foals with previous neonatal bacteraemia had significantly fewer racing wins and total earnings than siblings with no history of bacteraemia (Sanchez et al. 2008). A second study reported that the development of septic arthritis in Thoroughbred racehorses significantly decreased the likelihood that the horse would successfully race (Steel et al. 1999). Survival rates in mature horses with sepsis vary considerably with the primary disease process and are not always due to sepsis itself. Thus, it is difficult to prognosticate as no studies have been done to evaluate a large population of adult horses with the inclusion criteria of strictly SIRS or sepsis, regardless of the primary disease.",

Successful treatment relies on rapid intervention, particularly with antimicrobial drugs to treat the primary disease, as well as hemodynamic support.
