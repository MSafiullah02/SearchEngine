            "text": "Objectives: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes respiratory infection across the world, with infants and the elderly at particular risk of developing severe disease and death. The replication-defective chimpanzee adenovirus (PanAd3-RSV) and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA-RSV) vaccines were shown to be safe and immunogenic in young healthy adults. Here we report an extension to this first-in-man vaccine trial to include healthy older adults aged 60-75 years. Methods: We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a single dose of MVA-RSV given by intramuscular (IM) injection ( n = 6), two doses of IM PanAd3-RSV given 4-weeks apart ( n = 6), IM PanAd3-RSV prime and IM MVA-RSV boost 8-weeks later ( n = 6), intra-nasal (IN) spray of PanAd3-RSV prime and IM MVA-RSV boost 8-weeks later ( n = 6), or no vaccine ( n = 6). Safety measures included all adverse events within one week of vaccination and blood monitoring. Immunogenicity measures included serum antibody responses (RSV-and PanAd3-neutralising antibody titres measured by plaque-reduction neutralisation and SEAP assays, respectively), peripheral B-cell immune responses (frequencies of F-specific IgG and IgA antibody secreting cells and memory B-cells by ex vivo and cultured dual-colour ELISpot assays respectively), and peripheral RSV-specific T-cell immune responses (frequencies of IFN \u03b3 -producing T-cells by ex vivo ELISpot and CD4 + /CD8 + /Tfh-like cell frequencies by ICS/FACS assay). Results: The vaccines were safe and well tolerated. Compared with each individual baseline immunity the mean fold-changes in serum RSV-neutralising antibody, appearance and magnitude of F-specific IgG and IgA ASCs and expansion of CD4 + /CD8 + IFN \u03b3 -producing T-cells in peripheral circulation were comparable to the results seen from younger healthy adults who received the same vaccine combination and dose. There were little/no IgA memory B-cell responses in younger and older adults. Expansion of IFN \u03b3producing T-cells was most marked in older adults following IM prime, with balanced CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses. The RSV-specific immune responses to vaccination did not appear to be attenuated in the presence of PanAd3 (vector) neutralising antibody. Conclusions: PanAd3-RSV and MVA-RSV was safe and immunogenic in older adults and the parallel induction of RSV-specific humoral and cellular immunity merits further assessment in providing protection from severe disease.",

            "text": "Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a globally distributed pathogen that causes respiratory infections throughout life. Infants, adults with severe immune-compromise and the elderly are especially at risk of severe lower-respiratory tract disease and death. Infection rates for the elderly living in the community and care homes range from 5 to 10% each year, which is broadly comparable to the infection rate observed in younger adults, and greatest in the oldest members of the elderly population. [1] [2] [3] [4] The elderly differ from younger adults in having a greater risk of disease progressing to the lower-respiratory tract causing respiratory failure (8-13%) and death (2-5%). 4 RSV infection is responsible for a significant proportion of elderly hospitalisations for pneumonia (10.6%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (11.4%), congestive cardiac failure (5.4%) and asthma (7.2%), with all-cause 30-day and 60-day mortality rates of 9% and 12% respectively. 1, 5 Advanced age, senescence of the immune system and the accumulation of co-morbid conditions causes a hospital burden and mortality from RSV in the elderly comparable to seasonal influenza. 5-11 , 12 There is no effective treatment or licenced vaccine for RSV, and the magnitude of the disease burden has made the development of a safe and effective vaccine a major global health priority for many decades.",

Each uses RSV proteins F (F0 TM), N and M2-1 as antigen delivered by replication-defective adenovirus (PanAd3) and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vectors. Preclinical models that used homologous and heterologous combinations of these vaccines, including the intra-nasal route, found a single dose of intra-nasal (IN) or intra-muscular (IM) vaccine fully protected the lower respiratory tract from viral replication after challenge, with the IN route also capable of inducing sterilising immunity in the upper respiratory tract. Importantly the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of PanAd3-RSV and MVA-RSV was not associated with evidence of lung immunopathology. [13] [14] [15] In 2015 we progressed to the first trials in humans and demonstrated that delivery of RSV antigen using these replication-defective viralvectors was safe and capable of robustly boosting both humoral and cellular immune responses in healthy adults aged 18-50 years despite pre-existing natural immunity to RSV. 16, 17 Here we report the safety and immunogenicity of these vaccines in healthy older adults, aged 60-75years, with specific reference to the results from younger adult cohorts who received the same combinations of vaccine.",

No formal sample size calculations were performed and the number of volunteers in each study group was considered standard to assess phase 1 (first-in-man) product safety and tolerability. The four prime/boost combinations tested in older adults were selected from combinations tested in the younger age cohort and from preclinical data. Study volunteers were self-selected individuals responding to open invitation to the trial and provided written informed consent prior to any study procedures. Potential volunteers were excluded if they had any history of significant organ or system disease, any known or suspected alteration of the immune system, previous receipt of a simian adenoviral or MVA-vectored vaccine of any kind or any other significant disease or disorder that presented potential for risk, could influence the results or impair the participants ability to participate in the study (detailed in sTab. 1). Eligible volunteers were assigned to study groups by sequential allocation and were considered enrolled at the first vaccine visit. The primary and secondary objectives were the respective characterisation of safety and immunogenicity of each prime/boost combinations of vaccine (sTab. 2) and end points of the clinical trial were prospectively selected. The methods and results of the safety analysis are presented separately in the supplementary material (sFig. 1, sFig. 2, sTab. 3 and sTab. 4). Secondary end-point measures of immunogenicity were performed observer blinded by use of a randomly generated laboratory identifier. The collection and processing of samples and analysis of immune responses were pre-specified and performed as described previously, and only briefly described here. 16, 17 The methods and analysis of intracellular staining with flow cytometry (ICS/FACS) analysis are described in supplementary material.",

A self-cleavage site derived from foot and mouth disease virus 2A releases F0 TM into the supernatant while the N and M2-1 proteins remain intracellular. Deletion of the E1 and E4 loci of PanAd3 rendered the adenovirus vector replication-defective and MVA naturally cannot replicate in mammalian cells.

In total 1224 expressions of interest were received, and after initial screening 79 were invited and attended physician screening to identify and later enrol 30 eligible volunteers (see CONSORT, sFig. 3). All vaccine doses were administered between August and October 2014 which allowed for more than one month to elapse from when the last volunteer received a boost vaccine and the start of the 2014/15 RSV season, according to Public Health England (PHE) monitoring data, and minimised the risk of subclinical boosting of RSV-specific immune responses in the post-vaccination period (sFig. 4). A total of 376/379 (99.2%) of scheduled visits were attended and these data were used as the ITT population for analysis, and 373/376 (99.2%) of these visits were attended within the post-vaccination window specified in the trial protocol. One older adult volunteer was sadly diagnosed and died of oesophageal cancer before the final visit (study group 6, 43-weeks after single dose IM MVA-RSV) and was the only volunteer who failed to complete the trial. Overall each vaccine was safe and well tolerated in the older adult study population (see supplementary material, sFig. 1, sFig. 2, sTable 3 and sTable 4) with only one serious adverse event (SAE) which was considered unrelated to vaccination (sTable 5). There was no vaccine virus shedding by PCR following IN PanAd3-RSV (study group 8) and volunteer-reported influenza-like illnesses identified only one PCR-confirmed case of natural RSV infection 12 weeks after IM MVA-RSV boost from a volunteer in group 8.",

As an adjustment for baseline immunity we compared the fold change in antibody titres 28-days after each dose of vaccine which was when peak titres were recorded from younger adults. The mean fold-change in serum RSV-neutralising antibody titre in older adults was 2.21 (95% CI 1.1-3.3) 28-days following IM PanAd3-RSV prime and of a similar magnitude to younger adults (mean fold-change 2.06, 95% CI 1.4-2.7) ( Fig. 2 and sFig. 6). Prime with IM MVA-RSV, a single dose vaccine strategy that was not tested in younger adults, induced a mean fold-change in serum RSV-neutralising antibody titre of 2.42 (95% CI 0.5-4.3), and was comparable to the IM PanAd3-RSV prime as well as the boost response observed in IN PanAd3-RSV/IM MVA-RSV vaccinated younger adults (study group 3). The IN route of prime failed to elicit any notable change in serum antibody titres (mean fold changes of 1.04 and 1.06 in younger and older adults respectively). As with our observations from younger adults, the greatest serum RSV-neutralising antibody responses were noted following the first dose of any (PanAd3 or MVA) IM vaccine. Subsequent doses of IM vaccine (IM boost) failed to elicit any further incremental rise in serum antibody titres. For the 6 older adults primed with IN PanAd3-RSV (group 8) there was a demonstrable rise in serum The terms 'prime' and 'boost' are conventional terms and used here to indicate the first and second dose of vaccine. These terms are inherited from previous adenoviral and MVA-vectored vaccine research in immunologically na\u00efve subjects and our population was already primed from repeated natural exposure. Prime vaccines were delivered by intra-muscular injection (IM) or intra-nasal spray (IN), and all boost vaccines were delivered by IM injection. The cohort of younger adults, study groups 1-4, were enrolled, vaccinated and followed up between 2013 and 2014, the results of which are published elsewhere. 16 Here we report the analysis of an extension to the trial that included 30 healthy adults aged 60-75 years (study groups [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] .

However, vaccine-induced antibody alone may not be sufficient to protect from severe lower-respiratory tract disease in many adults, and despite the worldwide prevalence of F-specific neutralising antibody the surface expressed F protein target has undergone little temporal evolution suggestive of being under relatively weak selective pressure. For younger adults undergoing human stem cell transplantation the depletion of lymphocytes (not antibody) has been associated with the risk of progression towards the lower-respiratory tract, severe disease and death and serum antibody did not confer protection from infection or appear to modulate disease severity of younger adults undergoing experimental RSV-challenge. 30, 31 In addition to needing to generate biologically relevant neutralising antibody, the paralleled restoration of age-related losses of RSV-specific cellular immunity through vaccination may provide the added protection needed for limiting disease severity in the elderly.",

A clear signal of vaccineinduced immunogenicity across the spectrum of younger and older adult volunteers came from the F-specific IgG and IgA antibody secreting cells (ASCs) measured 7-days after vaccination. Mean F-specific IgG ASC counts of 149 and 173 spots per million PBMCs 7-days following IM PanAd3-RSV prime in younger and older adults respectively compares with 200 spots per million PBMCs observed 10-16 days following natural infection in younger and older adults. 32 IM MVA-RSV prime in older adults mounted comparable F-specific ASC responses in 3/4 samples. Our vaccine data, observations from natural infection, human experimental RSVchallenge and other vaccine trials have consistently demonstrated the transient appearance of F-specific IgG and IgA ASCs in peripheral circulation in the days after stimulation which soon disappear as the cells presumably traffic towards the bone marrow and mucosa. 16, 33 The next logical step was to look at how vaccination affected long-lived cells that underpin pathogen-specific adaptive humoral immunity. F-specific IgG memory B-cells circulated in all volunteers but a significant proportion of volunteers had no detectable F-specific IgA memory B-cells in the baseline samples, and IgA responses that were detected were significantly lower cell frequencies compared with the resting IgG memory pool. This dichotomy has been observed in children and paediatric healthcare workers and under controlled experimental RSV-challenge conditions in healthy adults, when there was also a noticeable absence of an IgA memory B-cells in peripheral blood before and after challenge. 33, 34 The ICS/FACS analysis appeared to independently corroborate the ELISpot findings of plasmablast and memory B-cell activity together with an absence of IgA memory B-cell responses. The role for IgA memory B-cells in protection from RSV is unclear, but an intriguing prospect concerns the effect of RSV-specific IgA can have at the respiratory mucosa. Under experimental RSV-challenge of healthy adults the quantity of nasal RSV-specific IgA can be associated with the risk of infection, and multivariate analysis from other observational studies have described low nasal IgA RSV-specific antibody titres as an independent risk factor for RSV infection. 25,33 , 35 The biology of mucosal and systemic IgA requires further investigation to fully understand and exploit the host repertoire of RSV immunity.",

[38] [39] [40] MVAvectored responses independent of vaccine priming have also been observed in naturally exposed influenza vaccine trials in the elderly and from phase I antigen-na\u00efve Ebola vaccine trials. In these trials, responses to the MVA-vector at prime were observed which were then boosted with an adenovirus vector that resulted in Tcell responses that superseded the conventional adeno/MVA combination. 41, 42 Ageing is associated with a contraction of the resting RSV-specific CD4 + and CD8 + memory T-cell populations in peripheral circulation and an expansion of suppressive regulatory T-cells, with relatively little change in central and effector T-cell function. 27,36 , 37 Repeated seasonal exposure may be relatively ineffective at maintaining/boosting T-cell immunity and, confounded by immune senescence in the elderly, a particularly desirable target for vaccine protection. Vaccine-induced antibody and cellular immune responses in blood were largely restricted to the first dose of IM vaccine and the value of the second IM dose was the added expansion of memory B-cells and, with the case of the MVA-vector, further expansion of IFN \u03b3 -producing T-cells. Data from RSV infection in adults has showed no correlations between the magnitude of the RSV-specific ASC response, RSV neutralising antibody titres and serum anti-F IgG antibody titres. 32 The preclinical animal challenge studies that involved IN PanAd3-RSV prime showed that sterilising immunity in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts was not associated with significant immune responses in blood. 13, 14 The PanAd3 vector used as an IN influenza vaccine in mice induced greater IgG antibody responses in broncho-alveolar lavage samples and greater CD8 + IFN \u03b3 T-cell responses in the lungs compared with the same vaccine given by intramuscular injection, which generated greater responses in the spleen. 15 The intra-nasal, live-attenuated influenza vaccine (FluMist) has protective efficacy in infants and has indirectly reduced the incidence of influenza in the elderly, although equally fails to elicit a substantial immune response in blood. 43, 44 The lungs are laden with resident antigen-specific T-cells that are not found in blood, especially for respiratory viral infections such as influenza and RSV. 45 In adults and protection from severe RSV disease, the baseline population of resident CD8 + (CD69 + CD103 + ) memory T-cells in the lung (measured from serial bronchoscopy washings) appears to be the main determinant for RSV disease severity. 30 The IN route, in younger and older adults, could have resulted in desirable immune responses at the mucosa that were not measured in this trial. The mechanisms behind mucosal vaccination that bring about protective immunity in the respiratory tract, seemingly independent of blood responses, remains a major focus for further investigation.",

This was described in HIV vaccine trials where anti-adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) neutralising antibody titres > 200 were associated with an impairment of vaccine immunogenicity to an Ad5-vectored HIV vaccine and increased rates of HIV-acquisition in circumcised men (although the association with HIV-acquisition waned over time). [46] [47] [48] In other studies, it was reported that adenovirus vector-neutralising antibody had little effect on T-cell responses. 49 PanAd3 and MVA were selected by low human sero-prevalence rates in combination with potent in vitro immunogenicity, and although anti-PanAd3 antibody titres were greater than the 3% expected from US and European population estimates we could not detect an impact with vaccine responses in the older adult population. [50] [51] [52] MVA vector-specific immune responses were not measured and, aside from the specified exclusion criteria, the potential remained for MVA-vector immune responses dating as far back as the 1960 s and childhood smallpox vaccination to have persisted in our cohort of older adults.",

In contrast, 90% of the elderly who are admitted to hospital and who die from severe RSV infection have a least one significant co-morbid condition and infection rates increase with age, and our small study population was not representative of the frail elderly at greatest risk of developing severe disease. 5 Although direct and indirect benefit could come from the vaccination of healthy older adults, additional clinical trials will be needed to establish whether these vaccines remain safe and immunogenic in the adults over 75 years with significant comorbidities. As immune correlates of protection remain elusive, further work is needed to determine whether the immune responses to these vaccines, and especially IN prime, can contribute towards protection from severe disease. Finally, the inclusion of the RSV F-protein in nearly all RSV vaccine candidate reflects the fact that this antigen is well conserved across RSV subtypes with little temporal variation and a target of both serum neutralising antibody and T-cell epitopes. Antibodies directed towards epitopes restricted to the pre-fusion (pre-F) trimeric structure of the RSV F protein are significantly more potent in conferring viral neutralisation, and it remains unknown whether the F-protein antigen used in PanAd3-RSV and MVA-RSV (F0 TM) presented pre-F as well as the more stable post-F epitopes for the induction of serum neutralising antibody responses. [54] [55] [56] [57] In conclusion, we report the first clinical study for replicationdefective viral-vectored RSV vaccines for towards the elderly population in need of protection from severe RSV disease. PanAd3-RSV and MVA-RSV were safe and, compared with the data from younger adults who received the same vaccines, lost no potency in boosting desirable RSV-specific immune responses. This included the parallel induction of humoral and cellular immunity, and the inclusion of targeting broad T-cell immune responses may prove especially important for protection in the elderly.",
