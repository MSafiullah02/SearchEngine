Such types of social activities increased their risk of being exposed to virus transmission which then resulted in quarantine and isolation in case of suspected or confirmed cases of the virus. Third, the strict security measures in the community prevented outdoor social activities, such as square dancing, park exercises, and parties. Fourth, the extended lock-down rules in nursing homes blocked face-to-face communications between older adults and their families (Ministry of Civil Affairs of China, 2020). Last, but not least, some older adults who lived alone or did not have close relatives lost their domestic helpers who were prohibited from traveling, or were in quarantine themselves, upon returning from lockdown areas.",
