The geographical and epidemiological landscape for malaria in the GMS has undergone tremendous changes due a number of factors including intense deforestation, rapid expansion of development projects, and a highly mobile population. Much of the malaria risk remains along the forested border areas in the GMS and particularly among mobile and migrant workers.

Adapting national malaria indicator surveys in Cambodia did not allow adequate estimations of coverage and utilization of long-lasting insecticide nets (LLINs), and alternative sampling methodologies were required. Introduction In compliance with WHO recommendations, African countries have discontinued chloroquine(CQ) and now promote artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), as firstline treatment for uncomplicated malaria. Faced with an average CQ treatment failure of 25%, Senegal changed its national malaria policy in 2003 from CQ to amodiaquine (AQ)+sulfadoxinepyrimethamine and in 2006, to AQ+artesunate. Studying travelers returning from a specific region, collectively infected by a wide variety of strains of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), could be an effective tool for detecting the evolution of resistance onsite.

Children were followed for 6 months. We compared rates using Cox regression with robust methods. Method and ResultsMSF was alerted by an unusual increase in the number of malaria patients in Burundi's northern provinces of Kayanza and Ngozi in December 2009. The decision to intervene in this epidemic prone region has been based on quantitative and qualitative grounds: observations in the health care structures, analysis of the malaria data and the history of an unusual rain pattern as potential trigger. During the emergency intervention between January and July 2010, 74% of the more than 120 000 patients with fever tested positive on a rapid diagnostic test (RDT). The intervention consisted of offering better access to diagnosis and treatment through fixed and mobile clinics, support to hospitals and prevention through the targeted distribution of 82 000 bednets. Further analysis of the data showed that the number of monthly cases exceeded already the proposed alert threshold in September 2009 and exceeded the proposed epidemic threshold in October 2009.

Seronegative partners undergo regular (6 monthly) HIV testing. These data are routinely entered in a clinic database. We performed a database analysis to determine the rate of seroconversion. Methods This prospective cohort study was carried out in a tertiary care hospital over 5 years. HIV patients with TB being put on ATT and ART concurrently were enrolled as subjects. They were followed up for a minimum of 12 months (m) after initiating ATT-ART. SO-CD4 was defines as a CD4 count rise of <100/mm 3 from baseline at 12 m after starting ATT-ART. Statistical analysis was done using R 2.11-1. Fischer\u00a2s exact; Rank sum and Chi squared tests were used as required.

However, its extensive use in mass treatment for schistosomiasis control potentiates increased tolerance to the drug.

Different RAPD profiles were also observed between different drug groups but also between male and female parasites. The well-studied schistosome antigen detection ELISA (CAA-ELISA) was transformed into a ultra-sensitive UCP lateral flow based assay (CAA-UCP). The objective of the study presented here was to demonstrate and improve robustness and sensitivity of this assay under field conditions. Data showed: (i) the development of dry-reagent assays with extended shelf life allowing shipping and storage at ambient temperature; (ii) usage of portable readers; (iii) simplification and increase of sensitivity by modification of serum sample handling; (iv) large scale application in a routine laboratory setting in South-Africa. The conclusion is that the assay is robust, suitable for use in low-resource settings, ultra-sensitive and specific, and has significant potential to be developed into a Gold Standard diagnostics for schistosomiasis. Referring to in vitro Although great reductions in human schistosomiasis have been observed after praziquantel (PZQ) mass drug administration (MDA), some individuals remain infected after multiple treatments. Many MDA programmes now require monitoring for drug efficacy as a key component. No molecular tools for PZQ-resistance identification currently exist, and ED50 investigations present ethical, logistical, and temporal restraints. We characterized the full behavioural repertoire of Schistosoma mansoni miracidia and assessed the feasibility and accuracy of a rapid, inexpensive in vitro PZQ test, in the laboratory and directly in the field in Uganda under MDA, in conjunction with highly detailed infection intensity, clearance and reinfection data as well as corresponding genetic diversity and population structure microsatellite data. This test strongly differentiated between subsequently cleared and uncleared human infections, as well as differences between parasite populations pre-and post-PZQ treatments, advocating its use for on-thespot monitoring of PZQ efficacy in natural foci. In the laboratory an enhanced dispersal potential and a greater proportion of erratic swimming behaviours were associated with increased praziquantelsusceptibility and in vitro praziquantel concentration. The use of this expanded behavioural repertoire could enhance in vitro tests used to detect praziquantel-resistance in natural foci. After only a few treatments, uncleared parasites from human infections were identified to be phenotypically different from drug-sensitive parasites, emphasizing the urgent need for monitoring of these repeatedly PZQ-treated populations.

The ticks left on the offshore oil wellhead tower by cormorants frequently bite workers and thus create the possibility of human infection transmitted via a tick bite. Human diseases have been reported from the region rarely, which, however, could be due to the lack of clinical awareness. Result We estimate an overall reproduction number of 3.25 for the whole municipality. The R0 by health area ranges from 2 to 7. Within each genotype, viral strains collected in SPICs grouped within a particular cluster. By analyzing the genetic mutations on the E gene, we observed that most of the mutations appeared during the first epidemic/endemic period. In addition, we found that specific amino acid substitutions on the E protein were rapidly acquired and then conserved on all DENV strains later collected in the region, thus reflecting a founder effect. Furthermore, our findings lead to the identification of the main routes of DENV distribution between the SPICs and should contribute to the improvement of dengue surveillance in the region.",

Yellow fever vaccine is a live vaccine comprising the 17D attenuated strain of yellow fever virus. The immunologic basis of the long-term, possibly lifelong, immunity provided by 17D vaccine is not known but has been speculated to be related either to persistent antigen stimulation or to a particular innate immune response signature. The 17D vaccine strain is normally cleared from blood during the first 4-6 days after vaccination. Recently, it has been shown that 17D vaccine genome could be found in the urine of healthy vaccines during the first week and up to 25 days post-vaccination in people with suspected vaccine-associated adverse events. To further explore the possible persistence of yellow fever vaccine virus in urine we tested urine samples from healthy yellow fever vaccine recipients at varying times up to 1 year after vaccination. Conclusions These results suggest that yellow fever vaccine virus might persist for at least 6 months after vaccination in some people. A larger study is ongoing to determine the frequency and duration of persistence of yellow fever vaccine viral RNA in urine of healthy vaccine recipients. Methods We describe the clinical signs, symptoms, and basic laboratory features in 1916 confirmed dengue patients recruited to a prospective observational study that took place in recognised centres of excellence in seven endemic countries across two continents.

However, this was not simply a result of poor accessibility. As women were largely unaware of specific interventions and viewed checking the pregnancy's progress and obtaining the ANC card as priorities, they had little reason to attend in early pregnancy. Furthermore, after ANC visits, healthcare workers scheduled monthly follow-ups, and fearful of being refused care for non-compliance, women viewed follow-ups as obligatory. In addition, three Kenyan women attending ANC in the first trimester were told by healthcare staff to return when their pregnancy was visible.",

These undetected infections have a clinical impact in pregnant women, suggesting the necessity of more accurate methods to detect malaria in pregnancy. We previously demonstrated that current m-phones can be easily used, without any additional devices, to photograph from a microscope and send images via MMS to a reference center for a remote second opinion. We then tested the method in different conditions, including in Uganda and Bangladesh, in order to verify the easiness, as well as the feasibility and appropriateness of the approach in remote limited-resource settings, both for diagnostic and capacity-building purposes. The experience is comprehensively reviewed. Over the period 2009-2011, eighty individuals participated in the testing. In Italy, 20 randomly chosen people, completely foreign to microscopy where asked to take pictures on the sole basis of simple written instructions. In both Uganda and Bangladesh, a total of 60 health workers and laboratory technicians -all with very basic previous laboratory training -where involved through 'on the job' training. Only locally available materials and technology were used, including microscopes and mphones. With few standardized instructions all participants rapidly learned to use m-phones to take quality pictures from the microscope and send them via MMS. The possibility of jointly observing and discussing images of the microscopic field on the mphone screen and eventually on wider portable PC screen enhanced learning speed and health workers involvement and interest. Images shared on a web-based platform allowed distant diagnosis and both clinical and educational support from experts overseas, including timely response over SMS.

Lessons learned from the process: Population based measurement of access was key to obtaining a realistic perspective of access, as the only way to measure non-use of available health services. The usual classification based on crisis situation showed its limitations. Postconflict contexts showed prolonged high mortality and financial access problems, but so called 'stable' areas, without any history of conflict were revealed as equally bad under five mortality indicators. Many assessments focus on affordability of care in terms of willingness to pay or avoiding catastrophic health expenses. MSF's experience showed the importance of exclusion/ deterrence from utilisation and the important financial obstacles linked to relatively small fees for primary health care. Increased utilisation rates allowed better assessment of the real disease burden in the community. Several population assessments postabolition of user fees show a significant reduction in general and child mortality.",

            "text": "Analysing health systems to make them stronger The attention for Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) has reemerged in the frontlines of global debate. Views continue to evolve, both in reaction to transitions in the world and inspired by new contacts and fresh ideas. We present a framework for description and analysis on health systems development. We followed a consultative process that consisted of a literature review on models and frameworks on HSs and HSS and consecutive discussions with health systems' experts. The editorial team wrote out the paper's drafts, which were circulated for comments, before finalizing it. The framework developed is useful for the analysis of any Health System at national, intermediate or local level and can be loaded with specific values and principles and contribute to strategic action. The framework includes the six basic building blocks of the WHO health systems framework, but goes beyond them by stressing four issues: (i) a focus on outcomes and goals; (ii) the importance of underlying values and principles; (iii) service delivery as the core building block, which needs unpacking (not a black box); and (iv) health systems interactions with the population and with the specific contexts in which they are embedded. HSS starts from an understanding of the health systems reality. It involves a root cause analysis of problems and an analysis of the power and interests of important actors in relation to the issues at stake. Guiding principles for HSS are: (i) strengthen the most important capacities first, these being governance, the health workforce component and service delivery; (ii) coordination of efforts based on a coherent policy and long-term view, linked with goals and values; (iii) recognition of the need for continuity in time and creation of structures to ensure institutionalisation of processes; (iv) alignment and coordination through dialogue and other steering mechanisms; and (v) continuous interaction with and adaptation to context. Results Participation rate was 38.0%. 11.8% had been resident for <3 years, 32.9% for \u20213-5.9 years, and 55.3% for \u20216 years. As migrants live in Catalonia for longer, they are more likely to be married [P-value for trend (P) = 0.0004], economically active (P = 0.03), have an employment contract (P < 0.001), have permanent residence status (P < 0.001) and be registered in the National Health Service (P = 0.0004). They were significantly more likely to report poor general health (P = 0.007), insomnia (P = 0.04), depression (P = 0.009), and consume psychiatric drugs (P = 0.007). These associations remained significant after adjusting by sex, age and country of origin. Length of residence was not associated with tobacco (P = 0.99), alcohol (P = 0.62) or drug consumption (P= 0.76), ever having been tested for HIV (P= 0.69) and ever having had a cytology (P= 0.76).",

We cannot rule out the possibility that migrants may be using health services more frequently, increasing the likelihood that conditions affecting their self-reported health status are diagnosed. However, results for screening services use seem to be inconsistent with this hypothesis and suggest that migrants' need for preventive healthcare may be unmet. Cultural perception of illness and high expectations of the health system may also have an influence in self-reported health.",

We analyzed perinatal data of n= 441,199 mothers who had singletons in 2001-2007 collected prospectively during pregnancy and up to 7 days post partum. We ran chi-squared tests, bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses. The outcome measures were unplanned peripartal hysterectomy, hemorrhage <1000 ml, eclampsia and sepsis. We treated maternal age, parity, occupational and marital status, smoking, obesity, adequacy of prenatal care, status after assisted infertility treatment and chronic conditions as potential confounders. Conclusion Marked disparities in maternal morbidity among women of different heritages were confirmed in this sample from Germany. The sociodemographic, behavioral and health-related confounders we examined mostly did not explain these observed inequalities. Monitoring maternal morbidity among migrant women is an important task and is a key to improving maternal health. A multidisciplinary approach is required to further our understanding of migrant women's health care needs. The screening test included complete red blood cell examination. At that time, pediatricians were alerted to a possible high risk of rickets in those children, and recommendations about prevention were made. We evaluated the evolution of the number of cases detected in the last 8 years.",

Thus we evaluated the current L. (L.) i. chagasi IgM antibody response in III profile, in order to confirm the recent nature of infection. Material and Methods The indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) using anti-IgM conjugate (Sigma) was carried out in 14 serum samples of III profile from endemic area of visceral leishmaniasis in Amazonian Brazil (Par\u00e1 State), as well as in 22 samples of SI profile (Symptomatic Infection = visceral leishmaniasis): seven with up 2 months of disease and 15 with more than 2 months.

Tenorio 1 1 National Center of Microbiology, Madrid, Spain; 2 Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain; 3 Hospital Carlos III, Madrid, Spain Introduction Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) caused an outbreak in Italy in August 2007, affecting more than 200 people. The index case was an ill traveler returning from India who arrived in an area colonized by one of the mosquitoes that transmit the disease more efficiently, the so-called tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus). Two non imported cases of CHIKV infection were also reported in France in 2010. In Spain, the vector is present, at least since 2004. Since 2006 the National Center for Microbiology (CNM) searches for the virus in cases with symptoms similar to those caused by dengue virus: fever and / or joint pain in travelers returning from endemic areas who enter the country, especially areas with movement of the vector. Material and Methods Serum and/or blood samples from 783 patients (87 in 2006, 221 in 2007, 164 in 2008, 133 in 2009 and 178 in 2010), which met clinical and epidemiological criteria of suspected cases (fever and/or joint pains after visiting an endemic area) were sent to the CNM. The samples were subjected to molecular dissection of viral nucleic acid (acute samples) and / or serological tests (acute, recent or convalescent samples). Molecular diagnosis was performed using a real-time PCR designed in the gene nsp1. Confirmation of positive cases was achieved by PCRs in classic format in the nsP4 and/or the ENV genes. The serological diagnosis was done using Indirect Inmunufluorescencet tests (IIFT Anti-Chikungunya virus, Euroimmun). Some positive samples were analyzed by microplate neutralization. Viral culture was performed in the laboratory of biosafety level 3 of the CNM. The samples were tested diluted 1:10 for IgG and 1:20 for IgM after removing IgG from the sample to avoid possible interference resulting from the presence of rheumatoid factor.Results and ConclusionsPositive results were obtained in 48 patients, 6.1% (15 in 2006, 14 in 2007, four in 2008, five in 2009 and 11 in 2010). PCR positive results were obtained in only two cases, showing that serology is the tool of choice for diagnosis of this infection. In 67 of these patients results consistent with acute dengue virus infection were obtained.

Aaskov 3 1 Institut Louis Malard\u00e9 Papeete, France; 2 Institut Pasteur de Nouvelle Cald\u00e9donie, Noumea, New Caledonia; 3 Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, AustraliaDengue fever really emerged in the South Pacific region as a public health problem in the second half of the 20th century . In contrast with the situation in hyper endemic continental countries and in the Caribbean, the epidemiology of dengue in South Pacific Island Countries (SPICs) is characterized by the non-persistent cocirculation of multiple dengue virus (DENV) serotypes and the long-term predominance, with local re-emergences, of a single genotype. After a decade of DENV-1 sustained circulation, DENV-4 recently emerged and caused several epidemics in the region in 2008 and 2009. In the present study, we addressed the question of the factors driving the epidemiological patterns of dengue in the South Pacific and the impact of regional and local contexts on DENV genetic evolution. We sequenced the complete envelope (E) gene of hundreds of DENV-1 and DENV-4 strains collected in the past and recently in different SPICs. Then we combined the analysis of the phylogenetic trees and the in time/in space fixation of genetic mutations with available epidemiological, eco-biological (climate, endemic mosquito species) and social (demography and population flows) data associated with the sequenced strains. Our results corroborate the previous observation on the predominant circulation of a single serotype/genotype.",

Chadee, V. Kissoon-Singh and F. Moreau Gastrointestinal Research Group, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada MUC2 mucin (murine Muc2) produced by goblet cells forms the mucus layer as the first line of host defence against enteric pathogens. Entamoeba histolytica (Eh) trophozoites bind Gal/GalNAc residues of MUC2 mucin and prevent Eh from damaging the underlying epithelia. As Eh do not invade the mouse colon, we tested early host responses towards Eh in the colon of wild type (Wt) and Muc2)/) mice (no mucus barrier) challenged with virulent Eh trophozoites in colonic loop studies. In Muc2)/) colons, Eh evoked a robust timedependent (1-6 h) secretory response concomitant with increased leakage of serum albumin, IgA and IgG as compared to Wt controls. In Wt mice, there was a significant increase in the secretion of high molecular weight mucin, non-mucus glycoproteins and IgA. Moreover, although Eh induced robust pro-inflammatory and protein expression (TNF-IFN-COX-2) in Wt animals, the responses in Muc2)/) mice were dampened. Neither Wt nor Muc2)/) animals showed increased gene expression of the goblet cell mediators TFF-3 or RELM. These data demonstrate that Muc2 mucin plays a critical role in protection against paracellular secretory responses toward Eh in the gut.

In the context of a double-blind randomized placebocontrolled trial using monthly chemoprophylaxis with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus artesunate to selectively control exposure to Pf during different periods in infancy, we evaluated the effect of age of first exposure in the acquisition of immune responses to Pf and their relation with risk of clinical malaria. Materials and Methods HIV-negative pregnant women and their newborns were recruited (n= 350 pairs) in Manhi\u00e7a, Mozambique. Children were followed up for 2 years by active (0-10.5 months) and passive case detection (0-24 months). Blood samples were collected at birth and 2.5, 5.5, 10.5, 15 and 24 months.

Garate 1 and E. Rodr\u00edguez 1 1 Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain; 2 Cietus Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain; 3 Hospital Carlos III, Madrid, SpainThe incidence of strongyloidiasis has risen significantly in Spain during the last years, mainly due to population displacements. Its immunological diagnostic shows low specificity . This disease causes severe symptoms, and sometimes is lethal in immunocompromised patients. In addition, immunodiagnostic techniques are not useful in this group of patients. A combination of immunodiagnostic methods with molecular techniques (PCR) is essential for a identification of the parasite. Thus we set up a real-time PCR from genomic DNA extracted from Strongyloides venezuelensis larvae 3 (L3). This parasite was selected because its biological cycle is easily maintained in the laboratory. The selected target for PCR amplifies a 100 bp fragment corresponding to a region of the 18s ribosomal subunit of S. venezuelensis. In order to optimize the PCR several amplification conditions (different DNA concentrations, primers) and detection systems (SYBR Green, Taqman probes) were tested. Results obtained thus far show a detection level of 10 pg of parasite DNA. On the other hand, the amplification product was cloned in a pGEMT vector for subsequent sequencing. Alignment of the obtained sequence with the ribosomal sequence of S. stercoralis (AF279916) and S. fuelleborni (AB272235) showed an identity of 99% and 98% respectively, corroborating the selected model as a good tool to develop a PCR protocol for the diagnostic of human strongyloidiasis. Also, we are carrying out assays to determine the analytical sensitivity of the technique by adding different numbers of S. venezuelensis larvae to healthy human faeces, and its application to clinical samples from Strongyloides infected patients. In addition, we have tested several faecal concentration methods of clinic samples from Strongyloides for their PCR diagnostic.Framework outlining the role of gender in relation to infection and morbidity caused by soil-transmitted helminths (STHS) T.

Pocket-ultrasound is a new, affordable technique, which may benefit these patients. Assess the impact of Pocket-ultrasound in diagnosis and patient management at remote areas. During 4 months in 2010 an observational study was conducted in Angolares District, S\u00e3 o Tom\u00e9 and Principe. During clinical evaluation, patients with formal indication were subject to Pocket-ultrasound (Siemens \u00d2Acuson-P10). Based on semiology, the practitioner registered a case report form including 'diagnosis', 'diagnostic confidence' (Likert Scale) and 'therapeutic management'. This information was reassessed after the ultrasound. Cases were peer-reviewed, to determine the presence of new relevant information and changes in 'Diagnosis' or 'Therapeutic Management'. Differences in costs with therapeutic management were registered. Data was analysed in SPSS \u00d2 using Descritive statistics and Fisher-exact, McNemar, Chi-Square, Wilcoxon-Signed-Rank tests.Results In a context of general practice, 84 ultrasound exams were performed in 76 patients (12.8% of patients observed). Pocket-ultrasound added relevant information in 79.8% of cases, changed diagnosis in 52.4% and therapeutic management in 59.5%. There was an increase in diagnostic confidence (P < 0.01), and a decrease in total therapeutic management costs (P < 0.05). From the first 2-month period to the second, there was a decrease in exams per patient observed with an increase in the relative risk of ultrasound not adding relevant information [4.31; 95% CI 1.5-12; 967; 2 = 9.87, P < 0.01]. In this context, Pocket-Ultrasound increased clinical diagnosis quality and decreased costs with patient management, reducing time to definitive diagnosis and risks of unnecessary therapies. This technology as a complement of the physical examination, although observer-dependent, seems to be beneficial to patients in remote areas. The increase of accuracy in semiological diagnosis during the study suggests the need for further investigation on informal learning and pocket-ultrasound. remote areas, portable ultrasound, pocket ultrasound, technology assessment, patient management, clinical decision, informal learningDistributed surgical instrument sterilization using solar powered autoclaves for low-infrastructure settings V.

The technology allows for the safe and reliable steamsterilization of surgical instruments in health clinics.The Solarclave uses a solar concentrator and a small boiler to generate steam that is transferred to a pressure vessel. Early experimentation ensured the 250 ml boiler and parabolic concentrator generate the appropriate amount of steam for a 5 l insulated pressure vessel. Advantages of Solarclave are: (i) decoupled solar concentrator and pressure vessel to reduce volatility in solar collection; (ii) scalability of concentrator design; (iii) design for local manufacturing and flat pack shipping.We are confident that such a system will enable physicians in remote clinics to perform high quality procedures and extend access to patients living far from conventional hospitals. Our findings include thermodynamic modeling of the system, an analysis of test results, and an analysis of qualitative and quantitative interviews with health care professionals in Nicaragua regarding device design and functionality.Perceived unfairness in working conditions: the case of public health services in Tanzania N.

In Maniema, MSF has started up health services in the district hospital of Lubutu (catchment area 100 000 inhabitants) through a strategy of intense, rapid and significant investment. This allowed the hospital to fully function as referral facility, with admission rate of 0.05 per inhabitant per year in 2010, intra-hospital mortality rates below 5% and documented significant contributions to improved health status indicators in the district. Continuation of services after MSF's departure depends on implementation partners and funding sources. A running cost analysis of the hospital allows to identify resource needs for the hospital to maintain an adequate level of quality and accessibility of care.Methods and Materials MSF real expenses for Lubutuproject from October 2008 to September 2010 were analysed according to an activity based costing approach (ABC approach). ABC identifies cause and effect relationships to objectively assign costs to each service proportionally. On basis of these real life data of 2010, a simulation of costs needed was made, taking into account the running costs of key elements per output unit and an expected level of outputs. A field based exercise with various local stakeholders determined a level of output (service utilization, package and quality of care) to be maintained over the next years. This allows to calculate what resources would be needed to reach this objective.Results A hypothesis of reduction of admissions of 20% was assumed, mainly due to the re-introduction of (small) user fees after the departure of MSF. Quality of care (including availability and international quality standards of drugs, medical material and staff) would be maintained. In this case running costs of the district hospital of Lubutu would amount to US$1.2 million per year, which is US$ 12 per inhabitant per year. The major expenses are drugs and medical items (34%) and health staff (39%). The main challenge ahead is adequate pay for health staff retention and remuneration. Today government contributes 0.7% of the wage bill and even under expected staff allocations, this would not exceed 5.7%. This annual cost per inhabitant fits within the MoH's framework of an estimated 19 usd per inhabitant per year for the combined package of primary and secondary care. The two actors interested in supporting the hospital after MSF's departure, have already identified 80% of the annual budget required. The model also allows to calculate the running costs of the hospital under the current level of utilization and outputs. Simulations show that patient fees contribute very little to the revenue and that additional resources required to replace patient payments would be small. In post conflict reconstruction of health systems, support to rebuilding hospital care is often neglected, as feared too expensive. This cost analysis shows that resources needed are not excessive and can fit within the country's financial framework. The Lubutu hospital documentation provides precious input for the health authorities to adopt realistic planning and resource mobilization to assure rebuilding accessible and quality health care systems.Lessons learned from an organisation-wide policy change within an international non-governmental organisation: process and issues linked to the removal of user fees within MSF supported health services M.

It aims to incorporate the Andean cosmovision as part of a new framework of political, legal and natural governance. Therefore, a new model of health care (MAIS) has been proposed, in an effort to satisfy the population needs and reinforce the principles and values of Primary Health Care through all life stages. However, end of life has not been yet recognized within this model and its relationship with health promotion remains uncertain for most professionals and policy makers.

There has been rapid development since then. This paper analyzes whether the NCMS and its policy change increased health services utilization and impacted on health seeking behaviors. and Materials The study was conducted in Shandong in east and Ningxia in west China. Three counties from each province were selected considering the economic condition and location, a total of 19 981 individuals in 2006 and 12 354 individuals in 2008 were interviewed. Key-informant interviews with administrators in county NCMS management office were carried out as well. The NCMS policy varied county by county. Generally, in Ningxia, pooling fund offered to inpatient care for all enrollees, with family medical savings accounts for outpatient care; in Shandong, a pooling fund offered both inpatient and outpatient care for all enrollees. The reimbursement rate was increased in 2008 than 2006. Outpatient visit rates for sickness in 4 weeks rose from 38.1 to 69.0% in Shandong and from 39.8 to 61.9% in Ningxia, hospitalization rates grew from 4.4 to 4.5% in Shandong and from 5.0 to 6.0% in Ningxia from 2006 to 2008. There was a trend of decreasing village clinic visits for outpatient services while visits to township and above-level hospitals increased in both provinces from 2006 to 2008. Hospitalization decreased in township hospitals and increased in county and above-level hospitals in Shandong, while usage of county hospitals decreased and usage of other level facilities increased in Ningxia.",

Around 3 million Latin American migrants live in Europe, often in poor socioeconomic conditions, of whom 80-100 000 have Chagas disease. Adverse socioeconomic determinants affect metabolic and mental health, both recognized risk factors for cardiovascular disease that may add up to T. cruzi harmful cardiac effects. We aimed to identify cardiovascular risk factors in Latin American migrants with Chagas disease living in Geneva, Switzerland. This cross-sectional study took place in 2011 at Geneva University Hospitals. All adult Latin American migrants with Chagas disease diagnosed in Geneva since 2008 were invited to participate. Interviews and blood tests assessed biologic and behavioral cardiovascular risk factors, and socioeconomical determinants of health. Results 136 patients were included in the preliminary analysis, all at the chronic stage and 17.5% with Chagasic cardiopathy. Most were women (86%), Bolivians (94.6%), undocumented (79.4%), without health insurance (71.6%), living below the poverty line (80.1%), having precarious and low qualification jobs (81%), with a median age of 43 years and a mean 7.4 years stay in Switzerland.

The results from the different project areas have highlighted the need to both monitor and study the migrant population health determinants in the specific field of infectious diseases. Data have also shown how to protect the health of migrants through the establishment of an effective working and human relationship with those people coming from different cultural realities. The work done by the Italian NFP and the practical partnerships between the different professionals has led to the development of different targeted interventions and health promotion actions for a population which is characterized by heterogeneous areas of origin, multiple motivational forces behind any personal migration project, social and personal characteristics and different legal status.Oral communications on global migration, conflicts and population health Health status, health behaviour and healthcare use according to length of residence among migrants in Catalonia Sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) is a global public health issue and a violation of human rights. Although asylum seekers are considered as particularly vulnerable, so far no cross-national studies assessed the patterns between SGBV experience and prevention knowledge, attitudes, practices and needs within the European reception system. Hence, this study explores which determinants in SGBV perpetration and victimization within the EU reception system are decisive for 'desirable prevention'. Applying community-based participatory research from a socioecological perspective; 599 interviews were conducted with professionals working and residents staying at reception facilities in Belgium, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. They reported 660 violence cases in the year prior to the interview. SPSS and R were used for analysis of quantitative data. Our results indicate that both professionals and residents are vulnerable to victimization and/or perpetration of psychological (n= 362) as well as sexual violence (n= 68) regardless of age, sex or residence status. Undocumented migrants are more likely to be victimized physically compared to others (OR 2.23; P< 0.012). Young age (<30 years) (OR 1.90; P< 0.001) and being a close peer of the victim (OR 1.93; P < 0.0304) are associated to higher probabilities of perpetrating physical violence (n= 359). Finally, perpetration of socio-economical violence (n= 68) is linked to older age (>30: OR 3.8; P< 0.001), to group aggression (OR: 2.55; P< 0.001) and to be committed by national citizens (OR: 14; P< 0.001). Thus, in order to be effective, it is paramount for SGBV prevention and response actions within the European reception sector, to mainstream for sexual and psychological violence. However, as for physical and socio-economical violence it is a prerequisite to differentiate according to age, residence status and social network. In support of this, the Senperforto project group developed a Frame of Reference on SGBV prevention and response for the European asylum and reception sector.Equitable access to quality maternal and child health care: an external evaluation for a pilot project to deliver a new service model for rural-to-urban migrants in three districts of China Methods An external evaluation of the project was conducted to understand its implementation and impact on policy, and to summarize the experience and benefit for rural-to-urban migrants. Of 85 stakeholders and actors were interviewed via in-depth interview or in focus group discussions.Results New MCH service models for rural-to-urban migrants were delivered in the project districts, including identification of previously unregistered pregnant women and children at community level through multi-sectoral efforts, referring them to health centers for registration, providing basic pre-natal or child health care at a discounted rate, subsidising institutional childbirth for the poor and free post-natal care visits. The project drove a transition from awareness to action among the local government and health providers. Consequently, multi-sectoral cooperation and an information sharing mechanism was established; a migrant MCH service package was developed and implemented; the medical financial aid was made available to migrants and clinical outcomes improved. An emergency referral system was established. The project also raised the awareness and motivation of the migrants to use and improved uptake of MCH services through participatory communication. Moreover, project experience was scaled up province wide and adopted by province health bureau.Conclusions The new service model could improve rural-tourban migrants' equitable access to quality maternal and child health care.Screening of imported diseases among migrant populations: results from a tropical unit in Barcelona ",
