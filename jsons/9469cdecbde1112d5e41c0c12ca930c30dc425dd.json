The spectrum of morphologic characteristics that are indicative of interstitial lung disease is relatively limited and includes a reticular pattern (with or without traction bronchiectasis), thickening of interlobular septa, honeycombing, nodules, and ground-glass opacities. In the correct clinical context, some patterns or combination of patterns, together with the anatomic distribution of the abnormality, i.e., from the lung apex to the base, or peripheral subpleural versus central bronchovascular, can lead the interpreter to a specific diagnosis.

When ILD causes an increase of fluid or cells within the alveoli, or thickening of the alveolar septa through cellular infiltration or fibrosis, then parenchymal background density will change in turn and ground glass opacities may be identified at CT.

For decades, patients with ILD have traditionally been investigated with HRCT (Mayo et al. 1987 ). This technique consists of a \"step-and-shoot\" approach, in which 0.5-to 1-mm collimation scans are obtained at 10-to 20-mm intervals, a small FOV, and a high radiation dose per section. It provides excellent image quality, free of partial volume and projection artifacts, and combines high sensitivity in the detection of ILD with high accuracy in establishing the correct diagnosis.

They thus combine the advantages of \"traditional\" HRCT and modern spiral scanning techniques. Volumetric protocols enable the radiologist to detect those abnormalities that might have been missed during the classic HRCT step-and-shoot approach. Moreover, volumetric isotropic data sets permit the reconstruction of high-quality multiplanar images, which help to appreciate better the distribution of disease, for example, to identify a cephalocaudal gradient of disease severity in certain disorders.

The radiation dose is 5 to 10 times higher, and the image quality is discretely lower in comparison to classic sequential HRCT. This image quality reduction is most apparent in the depiction of small septa and of ground-glass opacities (StuDler et al. 2005) (Fig. 26.3a,b) , and its clinical significance has yet to be determined. In order to achieve the best possible balance between diagnostic accuracy, exploitation of the advantages of volumetric CT and radiation dose, the following options exist ( This protocol utilizes high milliampere-second and kilovolt peak values to obtain the best possible image quality. Thin collimation (1 mm) scans are obtained at 10-or 20-mm intervals. Therefore, the overall radiation dose is a 5th to a 10th in comparison to standard or high-resolution volumetric protocols. This protocol may be regarded as \"imaging biopsy\" in diffuse lung disease, as it detects disease, allows the specification of disease distribution, and helps in establishing a differential diagnosis with high accuracy and confidence levels. It is our protocol of choice in patients with proven ILD, and in those cases that require imaging follow-up during or after therapy. Because the classic HRCT leaves 9-to 19-mm broad gaps between the scanned sections unexamined, it should not be utilized as sole protocol in patients with suspicion of focal lung disease, in diffuse interstitial disorders where there is an increased risk associated with focal or even malignant abnormalities (such as dermatomyositis/ polymyositis), or in entities with a distinct propensity to involve extrapulmonary sites in the mediastinum, the chest wall, the diaphragm, and the abdomen. In such instances, a combination with a standard volumetric protocol (Table 26 .1) is highly The reference mAs is the current preset of the protocol; the scanner controls the actual mAs within certain limits of this reference according its dose-modulation program Interstitial Lung Diseases recommended. Another caveat is the assessment of patients with suspected air trapping at supine scans. In these cases, it is advisable to perform single slice step-and-shoot scans in prone positions instead of a continuous volumetric examination in order to reduce radiation burden.

It allows for the assessment of the pulmonary parenchyma in slim individuals, visualization of focal abnormalities in the lung parenchyma, and analysis of major airways disorders. The combination with the classic HRCT approach fosters almost the same advantages as those described for the combination of the standard volumetric protocol with classic HRCT. When using this protocol, one has to keep in mind that the somewhat reduced image quality may limit the diagnostic accuracy when scanning the parenchyma, the mediastinum, chest wall, and upper abdomen in obese patients.",

In their idiopathic form, IIPs are rare diseases. They are, nevertheless, considered prototypes of more common secondary interstitial lung disorders, such as sarcoidosis, vasculitis, and connective tissue diseases, although they appear to follow a different and often less aggressive clinical course. The advent of HRCT has had a profound impact on the imaging of IIPs, because the detailed delineation of the lung anatomy allows a close correlation between the histologic patterns of IIPs and the CT features. On the basis of CT morphology and in the correct clinical context, the radiologist can achieve an accurate diagnosis in many cases. However, due to overlap between the various entities, complementary lung biopsy is recommended in virtually all cases.",

IPF shares nonspecific clinical symptoms, such as gradual onset of progressive dys pnea and cough, with other IIPs. There is a slight male predominance, and patients are usually over the age of 50. Typically, patients do not respond to corticosteroid treatment, and currently, the only lifeprolonging therapy consists of lung transplantation (Thabut et al. 2003) . While the term IPF characterizes the clinical entity, the term usual interstitial pneumonia is used to describe the histologic and radiologic patterns associated with IPF. The histologic and radiologic features of UIP are characterized by heterogeneity with areas of normal lung alternating with patchy fibrosis. The typical CT findings in UIP are predominantly basal and peripheral reticular opacities with honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis ( Fig. 26 .4a) (Mueller-ManG et al. 2007 ). Ground-glass opacities are usually present, but limited in extent. However, in patients with rapid deterioration during the course of their illness, also referred to as acute exacerbation, widespread diffuse or patchy ground-glass opacities have been observed ( Fig. 26 .4b) (Kim et al. 2006 ). Other complications that should be noted in patients with IPF include opportunistic pulmonary infections (e.g., Pneumocystis jiroveci) and an increased risk of bronchial carcinoma (Bouros et al. 2002) . Therefore, CT scanning should involve a combination of standard volumetric CT with sequential HRCT at regular intervals.",

Compared with IPF, patients with NSIP have a variable, but overall more favorable, course of disease, and the majority of patients stabilizes or improves on corticosteroid therapy. According to the predominance of either inflammatory cells or fibrosis, NSIP is histologically subdivided into a cellular and a fibrotic subtype. Cellular NSIP is less common than is fibrotic NSIP and carries a substantially better prognosis (Travis et al. 2000) . On HRCT, NSIP is characterized by patchy ground-glass opacities combined with irregular linear or reticular opacities and scattered micronodules (Johkoh et al. 2002) (Fig. 26.5a,b) . In advanced disease, fibrotic changes, such as microcystic honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis, become more evident (Desai et al. 2004) . In contrast to the heterogeneous lung involvement and the typical apicobasal gradient in UIP, HRCT in NSIP reveals rather symmetric and homogeneous lung involvement without an obvious gradient (Fig. 26.6 ).",

In its idiopathic form (as COP), OP is rare; however, it is frequently encountered in association with collagen vascular diseases, and in infectious and drug-induced lung diseases (CorDier 2000) . On corticosteroid therapy, patient usually experience complete recovery, but relapses are common. The histologic hallmark of COP is the development of granulation tissue polyps within the alveolar ducts and alveoli, with preservation of the lung architecture. On HRCT, COP is characterized by patchy peripheral or peribronchial consolidations that resemble pneumonic infiltrates and predominate in the lower lung lobes (Lee et al. 1994 ) (Fig. 26.7a,b) . Frequently, air bronchograms and perifocal ground-glass opacities can be found. Other common findings include sparing of the outermost subpleural area and mild cylindrical bronchiectasis. In addition to these typical CT features, other less specific findings can be encountered, such as irregular linear opacities, solitary focal lesions, and multiple nodules (Akira et al. 1998) , and diagnosis should be confirmed with surgical lung biopsy.",

In patients with sarcoidosis and parenchymal involvement, nodular opacities are the predominant finding. These nodules typically range in size between 1 and 5 mm and are often ill defined.

Most patients present with cough and dyspnea; sometimes additional systemic symptoms, such as fatigue, weight loss, and fever, are reported. Smoking cessation is the most important component in the therapeutic management of PLCH, with stabilization or regression of clinical and radiographic features in the majority of patients. CT is very sensitive for the detection of PLCH, and a correct diagnosis can be achieved in over 80% of cases (Grenier et al. 1991 ). On CT, PLCH is characterized by a combination of small nodules (1-10 mm) and cysts. The cysts are thought to arise by cavitation of the nodules, have a variable wall thickness, and are often irregularly outlined (Abbott et al. 2004) (Fig. 26.16a) . Usually, the lung abnormalities are most prominent in the upper lobes, with relative sparing of the lung bases near the costophrenic sulci ( Fig. 26.16b) . In later phases of the disease, nodules are less obvious, and cysts are the predominant feature. In this setting, PLCH may mimic lymphangioleiomyomatosis, but the latter occurs almost exclusively in women, affects the lung diffusively without sparing of the lung bases, and is characterized by uniformly sized cysts.",

Both AEP and CEP are often misdiagnosed as pneumonia, which can delay the correct diagnosis for months. Both AEP and CEP show a rapid response to corticosteroids, and there usually is rapid clearing of clinical and radiographic abnormalities within several days (Allen and Davis 1994) .",

In idiopathic PAP, several mechanisms are responsible for phospholipid accumulation in the alveoli.

The classification of pneumoconiosis is based on chest radiographs using the International Labor Organization (ILO) classification scheme. The CT features in patients with silicosis and coal worker pneumoconiosis consist of small, well-circumscribed nodules that are usually 2-5mm in diameter and predominantly affect the upper and posterior lung zones. The nodules in silicosis tend to be larger and better defined than those nodules in coal worker pneumoconiosis (Kim et al. 2001) . Occasionally, eggshell calcifications in the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes are seen. The presence of nodules larger than 1 cm is indicative of complicated pneumoconiosis, also known as progressive massive fibrosis. These nodules coalesce and form conglomerate masses that are typically located in the upper lobe of the lung. In large lesions, cavitation may occur, which is due to either ischemic necrosis or superinfection. In advanced disease, hilar retraction and compensatory emphysema, particularly in the lower lobes, is seen ( Fig. 26.23) .",

Chemotherapeutic drugs can result in four main types of lung reaction: interstitial pneumonia (IP), diffuse alveolar damage (DAD)/ARDS, organizing pneumonia (OP) (formerly referred to as BOOP), and hypersensitivity reaction. The CT manifestations of IP are identical to the pattern of NSIP, and consist of scattered ground-glass opacities and irregular linear opacities Fig. 26 .23. Silicosis with progressive massive fibrosis in a 72-year-old man. Coronal CT image shows a large mass in the right medial upper lobe (arrowhead). There is retraction of the hilus and marked emphysema. In addition, some scattered small nodules are present ( Fig. 26.24 ). In early drug-induced DAD (first week after lung injury), CT shows diffuse ground-glass opacities and consolidations, whereas, in the late phase of disease (after 1 or 2 weeks), fibrotic changes occur, such as irregular linear opacities, architectural distortion, and traction bronchiectasis. Drug-induced OP is identical to COP, and manifests on CT with bilateral areas of ground-glass opacities or consolidations that are often peripheral in distribution. Hypersensitivity reactions usually become clinically apparent within hours or days after institution of drug therapy, and patients typically present with progressive dyspnea, cough, fever, and peripheral eosinophilia (Rossi et al. 2000) . Pulmonary involvement can result in either acute or chronic EP. CT in EP shows ground-glass opacities and consolidation that are typically distributed peripherally and in the upper lobe. EP usually responds well to cessation of the administered drug and is exceedingly sensitive to corticosteroid therapy. Within the group of noncytotoxic drugs, methotrexate and amiodarone frequently cause drug-induced lung diseases in 5-10% of patients. The most common lung injury associated with both drugs is interstitial pneumonia. Organizing pneumonia is less commonly associated with noncytotoxic drugs (Fig.  26.25 ).",

The degree of radiation damage to normal tissue depends particularly on total dose and the fraction of that dose, irradiated volume, individual susceptibility, preexisting lung disease, and previous or concomitant therapy. Early radiation pneumonitis usually develops 1 to 3 months after the therapy, and the radiographic findings are typically confined to the field of radiation, resulting in a geometric shape of pulmonary opacities with a sharp demarcation line at noninvolved lung areas and disregard of anatomic boundaries. The earliest CT findings consist of subtle ground-glass opacities (Fig. 26.26) . These hazy abnormalities can progress to patchy consolidations that sometimes also involve lung areas outside the field of radiation (Davis et al. 1992) . Chronic radiation fibrosis evolves within 6 to 24 months after radiation therapy and develops continuously from the phase of acute pneumonitis. At CT, it is characterized by the presence of reticular opacities, architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, and volume loss. The major differential diagnoses in radiation pneumonitis include infection, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, and recurrence of the original malignancy. Microbial infectious pneumonia is not usually confined to the field of irradiation and runs a clinical course more symptomatic than the course of radiation pneumonitis.

Interstitial lung disease is probably most prevalent in systemic sclerosis, but is also a common problem in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), mixed connective tissue disease, dermatomyositis/polymyositis (DMPM), or Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. Lung involvement less frequently occurs with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The parenchymal manifestations of collagen vascular diseases seen at CT closely resemble those found in IIPs and can be classified using the same system. Although the proportions of interstitial pneumonias vary, the NSIP is the most frequently encountered pattern in patients with collagen vascular lung disease, especially in progressive systemic sclerosis (Fig. 26.27) . In keeping with the IIPs, the NSIP pattern is characterized by subpleural reticular opacities and varying proportions of ground-glass opacities, while in patients with UIP, honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis are the dominant abnormality. The predominance of the NSIP over the UIP pattern might explain the more favorable prognosis in patients with interstitial pneumonia associated with collagen vascular diseases than in those with IIPs (Kim et al. 2002) . OP is more common in RA than in the other collagen vascular diseases and is characterized by patchy infiltrates in a peripheral distribution. LIP is a typical, but rare complication in Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome in about 1% of patients during the course of their disease (SwiGris et al. 2002) , and CT findings include diffuse or patchy ground-glass opacities and thinwalled perivascular cysts (Fig. 26.28 ).
