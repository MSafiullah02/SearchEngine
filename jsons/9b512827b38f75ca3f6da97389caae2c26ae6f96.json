The assessment of emergency capacity in every country is a necessary part of the COVID-19 response efforts. Thus, it is extremely recommended to evaluate the health care system to prepare the country to tackle COVID-19 challenges. Methods and Findings: A retrospective and ecological study was performed with data retrieved from the public national healthcare database (DATASUS). Numbers of intensive care unit and infirmary beds, general or intensivists physicians, nurses, nursing technicians, and ventilators from each Regional Health Unity were extracted, and the beds per health professionals and ventilators per population rates were assessed. The accessibility to health services was also performed using a spatial overlay approach to verify regions that lack assistance. It was found that Brazil lacks equity, integrity, and may struggle to assist with high complexity for the COVID-19 patients in many regions of the country. Conclusions: Brazil's health system is insufficient to tackle the COVID-19 in some regions of the country where the coronavirus may be responsible for high rates of morbidity and mortality.",

According to studies dedicated to characterizing the clinical evolution of the disease, 39% of the cases demand emergency care, with a subset of 5% needing ICU and 2.9 % demanding ventilator support to sustain life (33) . In the U.S., the percentage of patients needing ventilator support was even higher, reaching up to 12,2%.",

It is possible to observe that all states and regions currently are presenting COVID-19 cases with a highlight to the states of Amazonas, Amap\u00e1, Esp\u00edrito Santo, and Santa Catarina, where it is already noted areas with hot colors. The hot colors indicate higher levels of incidence. In terms of deaths, all state capitals of the North, Northeast, and southeast regions are presenting high levels of mortality when compared with the rest of the country. Figure 6 presents three maps characterizing the Brazilian situation in terms of emergency services and the COVID-19 incidence. Panel A exhibits the accessibility index to ICU beds by population. The map highlights a higher accessibility index close to the state capitals of the Brazilian states. The map B emphasizes the municipalities presenting a COVID-19 incidence higher than the national average of 16.49, simultaneously with an accessibility index lower than the national mean 21 per 100,000 inhabitants Thus, every municipality in the map B is facing challenges in terms of emergency care services and a high COVID-19 incidence for the Brazilian standards. Map C presents the accessibility index of the new beds created exclusively to offer intensive care to COVID-19 patients. Few beds with this specific purpose were open in the states of the North and Midwest region of the country. Figure 7 shows the result of spatial clustering analysis to identify trends in access, as well as in the COVID-19 incidence. Panel A exhibits a hot spot covering the Southeast, Midwest, and South regions of the country. The states covered by the red layer presents the spatially significant group of municipalities with higher levels of access to ICU beds by population. On the opposite side, the blue layer highlights the regions facing geographical barriers to grant access to ICU beds to the population. To build the map B, the same approach was used, but this time only applied to the municipalities with high COVID-19 incidence and a low index of accessibility to ICU beds. The red color characterized a group of municipalities in the South and Midwest regions. Despite the higher availability of beds in these regions, it was possible to observe a statistically significant group of municipalities within these regions with barriers to access ICU beds. Map C illustrates the cluster of accessibility regarding the ICU beds created to tackle the COVID-19. The lack of overlay between the red color of maps B and C is pointing out a mismatch of the response efforts dedicated to addressing the COVID-19 challenge. The regions in map B characterized as hotspots were considered cold spots regarding the creation of ICU beds dedicated to COVID-19. The result suggests that the use of scarce resources needed to put in order ICU beds are not being directed to municipalities lacking access to emergency care services, despite their high levels of COVID-19 incidence.

To strengthen the WHO recommendations, the Brazilian Health Governments has established in the Resolution of the Collegiate Board of Directors number 7/2010, the quantities of ICU and infirmary beds per intensivists, general physicians, nurses, nursing technician and physiotherapists (25) . Although Table 1 shows that in Brazil, there is a sufficient number of physicians in the country, figure 1 shows that these professionals are not evenly distributed to accomplish the WHO recommendations and CBR. In addition, the number of nurses does not meet the criteria in the north and midwest. To illustrate the problem, figure 1 shows that Brazil has desert zones of ICU assistance and regions where these professionals have to take care of beds far beyond the quantities stipulated by the RDC. Bahtt et al., 2017 verified that professionals in critical care that were caring for more patients per shift were more likely to experience burnout (30). Halpern et al., 2017 informed that intensivists are also in shortage in the United States of America, and this situation may be attributed to burnout (31) . Therefore, the combat against the COVID-19 may be a difficult task in these regions, since providing access and affordable care for the large urban populations is already a challenge for many countries (32).",

The political positioning of the president is going against the technical recommendations of the Ministry of Health and WHO. Consequently, there is a disagreement between the Federal administration, and the states and municipalities. On account of that situation, each administrative level is conducting several response actions against COVID-19 without country-level coordination. The spatial clusters analysis highlighted that new beds created to tackle the COVID-19 were misplaced. The hot spot clusters of municipalities with high incidence and lack of access are not overlapping with the hot spot cluster of new beds dedicated to the COVID-19. This situation calls attention for the misplacement of scarce resources during a pandemic. The scenario depicted is the result of a lack of coordination at the national level. The consequence of misplacing the new COVID-19 ICU beds is an increase in the chance of deaths due to a lack of emergency care services for municipalities currently presenting a COVID-19 incidence above the national average.",
