            "text": "To feed 22% of the world population with only 7% of the world\u2019s total arable land, China has always given the highest priority to agricultural development and so as the research on crop and plant sciences. One of the most remarkable breakthroughs to increase grain production to date is the development and large-scale farming of hybrid rice. The preliminary research of hybrid rice originated from the discovery of male-sterile rice by Prof. Longping Yuan, who was later known as the \u201cFather of Hybrid Rice.\u201d His research paper about male sterility of rice published in Chinese Science Bulletin\n[6] opens the era of \u201cSecond Green Revolution\u201d and revolutionizes rice cultivation in China, establishing China\u2019s world-leading position in hybrid rice research and farming. Ever since then, studies about rice development 7., 8., 9., genetic analysis and disease resistance 10., 11., 12., 13., 14., 15., 16., 17. have constantly been the focused disciplines of Science Bulletin. Together with rice, researches on other important crops, such as cotton 18., 19., 20., 21., 22., 23., wheat 24., 25., 26. and the model plant Arabidopsis\n27., 28., 29., 30., 31., 32., have led to further understandings of plant physiology and the mechanisms of disease resistance.",

            "text": "China has a long history of freshwater fish farming. As such, another world-leading research field of China is freshwater fish physiology and reproduction. Over the years, Science Bulletin published many papers about fish biology and fishery biotechnology, from genetic analysis [33], hormone-regulated growth of freshwater fish, ecological genetics and selective breeding in aquaculture animals 34., 35., to gene engineering fish [36]. These studies greatly boost the cell engineering technologies, such as genome manipulation in fish. The development of transgenic fish, especially, has greatly improved the growth, color, disease resistance, survival in cold and other physiological characteristics of fish. Led by Prof. Zuoyan Zhu, scientists from Chinese Academy of Sciences produced a transgenic triploid fish with a much faster growth rate and an increased forage utilization rate compared with the control carps. More importantly, the transgenic triploid fish is completely sterile. The completely sterile transgenic triploid carp such as the all-fish growth hormone (GH) transgenic carp is very suitable for industrialized conditions 34., 37., 38., 39., 40.. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has evaluated the ecological effects of current and potential uses of the field release of GH transgenic Atlantic salmon and concluded that the fish poses no foreseeable risk to nature. The approval of transgenic fish for human consumption by US FDA would in turn foster the scientific research on fish biology and other fields of hydrobiology.",

In 2013, Science Bulletin first reported the isolation and characterization of avian H7N9 virus [45], providing immediate information about the virus. Later, one of the senior authors, Prof. Hualan Chen from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, was selected as \u201cTen people who mattered this year\u201d by the Nature magazine because of her contribution to H7N9 study.

The first report of genome sequence in Science Bulletin was about duck mitochondria by Prof. Tong Shen in 1982 [87]. Later, other papers published subsequently, for example, the draft sequence of rice [88], genome sequence of SARS coronavirus [89], sequence analysis of the vomeronasal receptor V2R genes in mouse genome [90] and the identification of male non-coding RNA genes in the drosophila genomes by comparative genomic analysis [91]. The most spectacular results of the human genome study have been provided by genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Genome analysis revealed the secrets of sex and lifestyle in caterpillar fungus [92], and uncovered disease resistance mechanisms in Medicago truncatula\n[93]. Recently, a study using functional genomic analysis afforded a clue to reveal the special living strategies of microbial community from sea surface to deep sea in Hawaii [94]. In plant science, as WRKY transcription factors are important molecules in regulating plant development and resistance. Genome-wide analysis of WRKY gene family in Arabidopsis lyrata demonstrated a vital role of WRKY gene in plant adaptation [95].",
