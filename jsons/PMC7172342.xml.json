It has been suggested that diagnostic uncertainty regarding PCs may impact mortality after HCT.15, 16 Difficulty obtaining a timely diagnosis naturally interferes with the clinician\u2019s ability to target treatment, leading to prolonged empirical management of many PCs.

Preengraftment PCs are usually infectious and occur within 30 days of HCT. These commonly include Gram-negative bacterial pneumonias in the setting of neutropenia and/or mucositis. Early postengraftment PCs, which occur between days 30 and 100, typically include infectious processes associated with impaired cellular immunity. Late- postengraftment PCs tend to develop after day 100, typically after immune reconstitution. Atypical processes may occur outside of these expected windows based on additional host risk factors (eg, opportunistic infection late after engraftment in the setting of delayed antibody response21). PCs occurring before engraftment, which are predominantly infectious, are associated with significantly lower mortality compared with those that develop later.1\n",

There are significant limitations to the sensitivity of chest radiographs for diagnosing PCs in HM and HCT patients, even when combined with clinical data.37, 38 In 1 study of febrile immunocompromised patients, one-half of those with a negative chest radiograph had parenchymal abnormalities detected on computed tomography (CT) imaging of the chest.37 Thus, a reliance on CT imaging of the chest as the initial diagnostic imaging modality is commonplace in the management of the compromised host with respiratory complaints.39 Chest CT is also performed routinely for disease surveillance during treatment of certain HMs (eg, lymphoma) and may be useful for comparison when diagnostic chest radiographs suggest a new PC.

The differential may be justifiably narrowed quickly enough to warrant empiric treatment without more thorough investigation in select cases. However, radiographic abnormalities frequently overlap or are ill-defined, and their management may present conflict. For example, bacterial and fungal pneumonias often present as focal or multifocal airspace consolidation, as does noninfectious organizing pneumonia. Given that organizing pneumonia would require steroids for treatment, and that steroids would likely exacerbate an infectious process, further investigation is paramount.

Additional assays are requested based on risk features of the patient, for example, endemic fungal exposures; and chest CT patterns, for example, nodule infiltrates, which may heighten suspicion for atypical processes. In recent years, culture-based methods of pathogen isolation from respiratory secretions or blood have been supplemented or supplanted by molecular testing techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction, for diagnosis of infectious PCs (Table 3\n). At our institution, polymerase chain reaction for the identification of P jirovecii, M tuberculosis, and community-acquired respiratory viruses is performed routinely on respiratory samples of appropriate HM and HCT patients. Antigen testing in serum (eg, Aspergillus galactomannan, beta-D glucan, cryptococcal and histoplasma antigens), and in urine (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila antigens), are obtained in appropriate patients.

Hypoxemia is another major concern in these patients, many of whom have diminished pulmonary reserve before FOB. In single-center retrospective studies of HCT recipients, the procedure has been associated with respiratory decline54 and mortality.55 Given that the likelihood of intubation after FOB in HCT recipients with acute respiratory failure may is greater, clinicians may favor a purely noninvasive diagnostic approach to PC diagnosis. However, data from a large cohort of HCT patients showed hypoxemia associated with FOB to occur in a small minority (1.8%), and led to mechanical ventilation in only 2% of that group.52 The overall low rate of intubation in the HCT and neutropenic patients suggests that a low incidence of procedure-related hypoxemia may be an acceptable risk.52, 56, 57, 58\n",

As a result of these differences, rigorous study is difficult and there is limited prospective evidence on which to base decisions regarding optimal timing, modality, yield or impact of FOB on outcomes in these populations.

Although few studies have rigorously evaluated the impact of FOB on patient management or mortality using prospective methods, available data suggest that early FOB is more likely to provide a diagnosis (especially bacterial) upon which changes in management can be made.72 FOB-guided changes in antimicrobial therapy have been reported in 20% to 70% of HM and HCT recipients,52, 54, 57, 58, 62, 65, 73, 74 including withdrawal of antimicrobial agents in nearly one-half of HCT subjects.52, 58 FOB results may also provide critical insight into the management of resistant pathogens. In 1 study, pathogens detected in BAL alone demonstrated antimicrobial resistance profiles integral to management, thus rendering inappropriate the choice of empiric therapy based on antimicrobial profiles identified in upper respiratory or peripheral specimens.64 However, diagnostic yield may not always correlate with a change in management, as demonstrated in neutropenic intensive care unit patients, where a 50% diagnostic yield had little impact on treatment changes.65\n",

Diagnostic delay or a lack of diagnosis has been shown to independently predict death in immunosuppressed hosts with pulmonary infiltrates, highest in critically ill HCT recipients and those with FN.15, 76 This finding highlights the importance of obtaining a correct microbiological diagnosis in the compromised patient, when possible.77\n",

Furthermore, the identification of a potential pathogen, such as cytomegalovirus or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or fungal antigen, such as beta-D glucan, in BAL, does not always imply causation, emphasizing the importance of clinical context in the interpretation of results. BAL cytology continues to be useful to suggest processes involving tissue invasion (such as P jirovecii pneumonia and cytomegalovirus disease) in the absence of biopsy specimens, and may also identify malignant cells (eg, lymphoma), hemorrhage, and alveolar proteinosis. BAL cell count is generally nonspecific, although it may be useful in diffuse alveolar hemorrhage or organizing pneumonia. Lung tissue histopathology is important not only for definitive diagnosis of invasive fungal or viral infections, but also malignancy, organizing pneumonia, and interstitial diseases associated with drug toxicity.",

            "text": "Early diagnosis of PCs is challenging owing to heterogeneous patient, clinical, and provider factors. A delay in PC diagnosis limits the opportunity for targeted treatment, which may contribute to poor outcomes. Thus, an integrated clinicoradiologic approach can provide crucial insight into the nature of PCs, and provide guidance for further diagnostic testing in HM and HCT patients. Although controversy persists, available data suggest an advantage to early FOB in terms of diagnostic yield, targeted management, and mortality for high-risk HM and HCT recipients, perhaps with exception in the critically ill population. A low threshold for minimally invasive lung sampling should therefore be a guiding principle in high-risk patients, including those with FN and recipients of HCT. This practice may become especially important as advances are made in the sensitivity and specificity of next-generation sequencing applications for infectious disease diagnosis. Empirical treatment is important for the neutropenic or febrile patient presenting with signs or symptoms of pneumonia, however FOB within 72 hours of intubation and empiric treatment is nonetheless encouraged. After careful assessment of risk, lung biopsy via TBLB or transthoracic lung biopsy should be considered when there is concern for invasive fungal or viral disease and in the absence of supportive data from noninvasive sources. SLB should be reserved for cases where diagnoses remain elusive despite investigations of BAL or lung tissue obtain via minimally invasive modalities, and where increased procedural risk is warranted in favor of diagnostic results that would impact key aspects of management. Although prospective study is needed to determine optimal the strategy for lung sampling, close attention to individual risk/benefit profiles will always remain integral to management.",
