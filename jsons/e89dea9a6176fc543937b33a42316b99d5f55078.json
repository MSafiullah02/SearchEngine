It has been shown that suckling mothers and their young expend less energy in large colonies than in small, as the denser the group, the greater the insulation and the steadier the temperature. This probably is one of the main reasons why females congregate in nurseries in the spring. Another advantage is collaboration. Close relatives, often older siblings or half-siblings, help to raise a mother's young, and even unrelated individuals in the same colony are known to assist each other. An adult normally stays close to the pups when it is time for the colony to go out hunting, and in some cases, the pups are gathered together to facilitate their supervision-a cr\u00e8che for bats, as it were. Even though a female can carry a relatively large pup on the breast, she usually leaves it behind-otherwise the pup attaches itself firmly to her nipples and clings onto her fur with its feet.",

In some monogamous species, however, the males take active responsibility and, in smaller harems, defend both the living territory and hunting ground with demonstrations of flying prowess, aggressive calls, and scent marking.",

While much has already been learned about the sounds used in communication between females and their young and mating and territorial calls, more and more different communicative sounds are being discovered all the time. In recent years, it has been found that bats cannot only tell the members of their closest circle by their voices but can also hear the difference between those of different colonies, suggesting the possibility of dialects. One study carried out in Florida showed that free-tailed bats live in many respects as if in a musical and sing almost constantly, each song depending on the context and composed according to message, be it a warning, information, directions, or an invitation. The fact is that they use something akin to syntax and syllables in what is effectively a chiropteran language. The males sing a tune every time another bat passes their roost, an aggressive one for the males and a welcoming one for females. This can mean a great deal of singing for free-tailed bats since the colonies often comprise millions of individuals in different groups and permutations of harem, sex, and age. Moreover, the roost as well as the size and composition of the colony vary with the season, which could also explain why such behaviour has evolved, the nature of the social context necessitating a flexible and complex communication system.",

They found that the bat cells reacted much more quickly and effectively than the human, implying that their biochemical defence is simply superior to ours. The reason for this is a matter of speculation, but it could have something to do with their ability to fly. Active flight is extremely energy demanding and pushes the bat metabolism to levels way above resting. A number of by-products are thus formed in the body during flight, including DNA-damaging free radicals. Over the millions of years of bat evolution, their cell repair system has been fine-tuned to handle such damage as swiftly and effectively as possible. A fortunate side-effect of this could, then, be that other cellular damage is dealt with in a similarly efficacious manner. Perhaps, this is where we might also find the key to why bats live so long.

Researchers then found hundreds of dead bats and observed peculiar behaviours. For example, the bats were not hibernating normally but waking up from their torpor and flying around both inside and outside their winter roosts, and not only at night. For a bat with a winter fat reserve, this is, of course, potentially fatal and many of the dead individuals had simply starved. Since then, the problem has quickly escalated. In 2008, the first cases were found outside New York State, in Vermont and Massachusetts, and there were reports the following year from four more states. The disease now exists from Canada to Mississippi and has claimed 7 million lives from a dozen different species to date.
