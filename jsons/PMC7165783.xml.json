However, there is no information regarding the circulation of enteric viral agents such as rotavirus (RV) and coronavirus (CV) among these animals. Rotaviruses are a major cause of neonatal diarrhoea in humans and numerous animal species world\u2010wide (Kapikian and Chanock, 1996). In Argentina, RV is considered one of the most important causes of diarrhoea in calves (Barrandeguy et al., 1988; Bellinzoni et al., 1989, 1990; Costantini et al., 1999), and its presence has been reported in piglets and foals (Mattion et al., 1989; Parre\u00f1o et al., 1997).",

These results showed a similar distribution of high antibody titres in the groups of convalescent and healthy guanacos. As it was not possible to obtain paired serum samples from the affected animals, corresponding to the acute and convalescent phase of the disease, serological confirmation of the viral infection by seroconversion was not possible. However, the presence of very high antibody titres in some of the convalescent animals (1:16 384) suggests recent exposure to RV. In contrast, all animals tested were negative for BCV antigen in faeces (none of 53) and BCV antibodies in serum (none of 47), suggesting that this pathogen was not circulating in the guanaco population under study and was not involved in the diarrhoea outbreak.",

The present data suggests an absence of adequate levels of passive protection that may be associated with the high mortality observed after the diarrhoea outbreak.
