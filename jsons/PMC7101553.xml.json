Interestingly, our data showed that among patients with CAP caused by S. pneumoniae that required ICU management, the presence of septic shock and a low initial serum CRP level at admission correlated with a fatal outcome. This finding is unexpected and counterintuitive. Most clinicians would consider a priori that low CRP values may be associated with a less severe systemic inflammation response, which should reflect a better prognosis. However, data from animal studies suggest an association between CRP values and survival. In mice, administration of CRP within a few hours of a S. pneumoniae challenge led to a reduction in the concentration of bacteria in the blood, and consecutively lessened the severity of the infection [19, 20]. Over the study period, PCT values were only available for a small number of patients, precluding any conclusion about the absence of difference between survivors and non-survivors.",

Nevertheless, these patients can be considered as a homogenous cohort of severely ill patients requiring ICU management in an institution where the ratio between ICU and intermediate care beds is 1\u20133. The absences of electronic or computerized documentation of care preclude analyzing the impact of delay between hospital admission and first antibiotic administration on patient outcome. However, community-acquired pneumonia is characterized by an undefined and highly variable time between onset of the disease, clinical manifestations, and hospital admission. As such, the precise interval of time between onset of the disease and the first antibiotic administration is hard to determine, although highly relevant. This observation is only valid in the specific stetting of patients with severe pneumonia requiring ICU management. Our results should be considered as preliminary, but should be of sufficient interest to justify confirmation in larger cohorts of patients.",
