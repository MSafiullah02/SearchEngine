In comparison with controls, a significant difference in linear trend distribution of FcgRIIA genotypes was seen among the severe SARS patients (ICU and deceased subgroups) without co-morbidity, and the incidence of FcgRIIA-H/H131 was lower in these patients as well. There were no significant differences in MBL genotypes and allele frequencies among SARS patients and controls. The study reveals that in addition to age and co-morbidity, FcgRIIA polymorphism of individuals may also influence outcome after infection with the SARS-Cov.",

Although the global cumulative total was more than 8000 cases with over 900 deaths, the majority of cases were from Southeast Asia. The causative agent of SARS is a novel coronavirus, the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-Cov). People of all ages were affected; however, health care workers were at high risk (1). Risk factors for death included old age and underlying illnesses, such as diabetes and cardiac disease (2, 3) . It would be important to investigate whether host genetic factors could influence the susceptibility to SARS-Cov infection and its subsequent clinical course.",

The human Fc g-receptor IIA (FcgRIIA) is an important member of the Fc receptor family that plays a central role in the regulation of immunity and autoimmunity and the initiation of local inflammation. It forms an essential link between the humoral branch and the effector cells of the immune system. The FcgRIIA gene is known to contain a functional polymorphism with a G!A point mutation resulting in an arginine (R) or histidine (H) residue at amino acid position 131 in the Ig-like domain, and this polymorphism is known to affect receptor affinity and specificity. These polymorphisms have clinical implications and may represent a risk factor for certain diseases, either at the level of disease susceptibility or at the level of disease severity, including infectious diseases such as meningococcal disease, Streptococcus pneumoniae infections, dengue fever and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (4) (5) (6) (7) .",

Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) plays a critical role in the first line of such host defence against pathogens via the lectin pathway of complement. MBL is able to bind microorganisms including bacteria, mycobacteria, certain parasites and viruses, such as the HIV, the respiratory syncytial virus, herpes virus and influenza virus (8) . There are five single-nucleotide polymorphisms influencing serum MBL levels, which lead to several MBLsufficient and MBL-deficient genotypes/haplotypes (9) including three single-nucleotide polymorphisms at codons 52 (Arg-Cys), 54 (Gly-Asp) and 57 (Gly-Glu) in exon 1 and two promoter polymorphisms at positions 550 (g-c, alleles H/L) and 221 (g-c, alleles X/Y) to form a number of coding genotypes and promoter haplotypes listed in Table 3 . Polymorphisms in both FcgRIIA and MBL genes influence the inflammatory process and have a strong impact on susceptibility to numerous bacterial and viral infections. FcgRIIA-R131 and MBL coding mutations or deficient genotypes have been reported to be associated with susceptibility to infectious diseases (9) (10) (11) . To examine the hypothesis that polymorphisms of FcgRIIA and MBL genes in SARS patients are genetic factors influencing susceptibility to the infection and severity of the disease post infection, we studied polymorphisms of FcgIIRA and MBL genes in DNA samples from a group of 180 Hong Kong SARS patients with different clinical outcomes and compared these with 200 normal blood donors from the same region as a control group.",

Patients' demographics are summarized in Table 1 . The control group consisted of 200 blood donors from Hong Kong. The study was approved by the Institutional Human Ethics committees of the Prince of Wales Hospital and the Hong Kong Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service. DNA was extracted from patients' blood samples using the QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA was extracted from blood samples of blood donors using a standard salting-out procedure (12) . Other control groups were Australian blood donors whose FcgRIIA or MBL genotypes have been reported in separate studies (5, 13) . For FcgRIIA genotyping, sequence-specific polymerase chain reaction (SSP) was used to identify the FcgRIIA-R-H-131 polymorphisms as described previously (7). For MBL2 genotyping, the 550 (H/L), the 221 (X/Y) and codon 52Cys, 54Asp, and 57Glu MBL2 polymorphisms were determined in the patients and controls, using the SSP method as described previously (14) . Data were analysed for differences in distribution of FcgRIIA genotypes among groups using w 2 -test for linear trend or independence (2 \u00c2 3 contingency tables and w 2 -analysis). Frequencies of MBL genotype and FcgRIIA genotype (e.g. FcgRIIA-R/R131 vs combined FcgRIIA-R/H131 and FcgRIIA-H/H131 or FcgRIIA-H/H131 vs combined FcgRIIA-R/H131 and FcgRIIA-R/R131) as well as the allele frequencies were compared among groups using Fisher's exact test (2 \u00c2 2 contingency tables, two-sided or one-sided as indicated). Differences were considered significant when P < 0.05.",

            "text": "Study of the role of host gene polymorphisms in human diseases, especially how these polymorphisms influence both the susceptibility to diseases and the course of disease development, has been an important area of investigation. Unlike many other genes where genetic variants have no clear functional contribution to a population disease profile, the FcgRIIA exhibits a clear functional difference between R131 and H131 allotypes and has relevance for some infectious and autoimmune diseases. The results of this study demonstrate for the first time that FcgRIIA-R/ R131 genotype was significantly associated with severity of SARS infection (P < 0.05). Patient's age is an important prognostic factor influencing survival post SARS infection, because almost half of the deceased, compared to only five out of 159 patients who recovered (home and ICU subgroups), were aged over 70 years (Table 1) . However, in both home and ICU patient subgroups in which the majorities were of a younger age group, FcgRIIA polymorphisms appear to influence the course of SARS infection. Co-morbidity might have influenced severity of SARS infection, but FcgRIIA polymorphisms was still significant as distribution of FcgRIIA genotypes was different among the severe SARS patients (when the ICU and deceased patients were amalgamated) after corrections for co-morbidity, compared with the controls (P < 0.05). Furthermore, patients without co-morbidity from both ICU and deceased subgroups displayed a lower frequency of the FcgRIIA-H/H131 genotype. Our results suggest that R/R could be a risk factor for developing a more severe course of SARS-Cov infection while H/H might have a protective role in the outcome of SARS infection. Interestingly, during the SARS outbreak, plasma from convalescent patients who recovered from the SARS infection was used to treat some cases of SARS patients with favourable responses (15, 16) . Studies on viral neutralizing activity of anti-SARS plasma have been reported (17, 18) , but the functional relevance of antibody against SARS and whether this antibody might work via a Fc-dependent receptor remain to be established. Because activation of FcgRIIA is initiated by antibody binding followed by multiple biologic processes such as signal transduction, phagocytosis and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, release of inflammatory mediators, and interaction with other Fc receptors and complement factors, it would be useful to study the FcgRIIA genotypes in parallel with the presence/level of antibody to SARS-Cov in these SARS patients. Additionally, FcgRIIA genotyping carried out on patients may help to predict the efficacy of antibody-based immunotherapy in the future.",

Interestingly, MBL genotype profiles are similar between our patients and the Ip group. However, no statistically significant differences between SARS patient groups and controls were observed for the MBL genotypes in our study, despite a higher 54Asp allele frequency found in home subgroup compared with controls or ICU/deceased subgroups. The smaller size of our study group could be the reason why our study did not demonstrate any significant differences in MBL genotypes/haplotypes and susceptibility to SARS-Cov. In comparisons of MBL polymorphisms between Hong Kong blood donors and Australian blood donors and healthy Vietnamese children, 54Asp seems to be a predominant variant in the Chinese population with only one out of 200 (0.5%) Hong Kong blood donors carrying the 52Cys variant (Table 3) , while 42% of Australian blood donors carry either the 54Asp or/ and the 52Cys, 57Glu variants (13) . However, less deficient and more sufficient MBL genotypes were found in Hong Kong blood donors than those in Australian blood donors (P < 0.05), while MBL-54 allele frequencies and genotypes in Hong Kong blood donors were similar to those among the Australian blood donors and Vietnamese (Table 4 ). In summary, our data are in line with previous reports that age and existing medical co-morbidity play a major role in determining the mortality and morbidity of SARS-Cov infection. In addition, the major finding of our study is a significant association between FcgRIIA-R/R genotype and the severity of SARS-Cov infection. Further studies are required to explore the possible role of these and other host genetic factors that may influence the susceptibility and disease outcome of SARS-Cov infection.",
