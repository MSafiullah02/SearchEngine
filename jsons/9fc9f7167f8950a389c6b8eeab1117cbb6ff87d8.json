However, the Ebola experience demonstrated the feasibility of rigorously evaluating therapeutic measures during an epidemic (14) , and the evaluation of Chinese herbal medicine for COVID-19 is by no means an exception. Indeed, in the case of COVID-19 where experimental infection could not be used to facilitate the conduct of randomised trials, the current outbreak provides the only opportunity for evaluating the efficacy of Chinese herbal medicine. It is now the prime time to start randomised trials as the peak of the epidemic has pasted in China (15) , and the healthcare system has more capacity to plan for evaluation. In fact, on 3 February 2020, the Ministry of Science and Technology has launched a clinical research programme on integrative medicine treatment for COVID-19, in which COVID-19 treatment centres in Hubei, Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei and Guangdong will participate (16) .",

However, divergent views on what constitute the most promising investigational TCM intervention seem to challenge the coordinated effort. Despite the prompt development of a national guideline, only four provinces, namely Shanxi, Anhui, Fujian and Qinghai, have adopted it, and Beijing, Tianjin and Xinjiang implemented its revised version (17) . Shanghai, Henan and Chongqing decided to develop their own Chinese herbal medicine treatment scheme J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (17) . The National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine initiated another clinical research programme in Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hebei and Heilongjiang, investigating a single Chinese herbal formula intended for different stages of the disease (18) .",

A multi-disciplinary team would be the key to success; it should consist of members who have expertise in COVID-19, TCM, clinical research methodology, as well as ethics and regulations, and those who are patient representatives. Additional research investment in terms of resources and personnel will enable the immediate systematic collection of data on outcomes which could later be shared across centres in a coordinated manner. Such data are expected to provide an insight as to how TCM interventions impact prognosis. Besides, they will help identify which promising Chinese herbal medications should be prioritised for further assessment in randomised trials. Since Chinese herbal medicine has already been widely prescribed across the nation, an efficacydriven approach could be adopted, focusing on phase II or III randomised trials.",

We hope that future evaluation of the outcomes of implementing TCM recommendations will strengthen the evidence base for COVID-19 management not only for the sake of public health but also for the promotion of TCM status in the world.
