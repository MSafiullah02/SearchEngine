Assuming these three people were not among the 1728 who were known to have developed SARS pneumonia, and assuming no one in Hong Kong was exposed to SARS coronavirus before March, 2003, these three confirmed cases divided by the total number of blood donors in the study population would represent the cumulative incidence of non-pneumonic SARS in this population (which again might or might not be representative of all blood donors, depending on whether they were selected at random and might or might not be representative of the wider Hong Kong adult population).",

Similarly, if it is fair to assume that the other study groups are representative of some broader community group, these cumulative incidence figures could be compared, although care in interpretation would need to be taken given the low numbers in the study population.",

This situation arises particularly given the known effect of age and chronic medical conditions on the epidemiology of SARS, but could well be influenced by other (known and unknown) confounders too.",
