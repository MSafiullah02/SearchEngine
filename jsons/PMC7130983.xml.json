            "text": "The clinical manifestations in cats infected by Toxoplasma gondii are diverse with both fatal and sub-lethal chronic syndromes being reported. Intestinal toxoplasmosis, which results from the sexual replication of the parasite in feline enterocytes, may lead to self-limiting diarrhoea. The diagnosis of intestinal toxoplasmosis is based on the detection of T. gondii oocysts in the faeces of the cats. When extra-intestinal toxoplasmosis is acquired transplacentally or by suckling in kittens, the condition is often clinically severe. Clinical signs include fever, dyspnoea, icterus and anorexia (Dubey and Lappin, 1998). In these fatal cases, definitive diagnosis is made by histological examination. Extra-intestinal toxoplasmosis may also be suspected in other cats with a more chronic course. The most frequent clinical finding in this form of disease is uveitis. Multifocal to diffuse retinochoroiditis, optic neuritis are signs of posterior uveitis whereas iritis, keratic precipitates, lens luxation and secondary glaucoma are present in anterior uveitis. Ocular toxoplasmosis may be unilateral or bilateral. It usually occurs alone in cats without any systemic signs of the disease (fever, dyspnoea or anorexia) (Davidson, 2000).",

The presumptive diagnosis is usually based on exclusion of other potential causes of feline uveitis and the response to anti-Toxoplasma drugs (sulfa drugs or clindamycin). The interpretation of serological tests is not straightforward. Cats with uveitis are usually seropositive for T. gondii and other ocular pathogens such as feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIP) (Lappin, 2000). Moreover, the presence of anti-T. gondii antibodies can be demonstrated in the serum and aqueous humor of normal cats.",

Formalin-treated T. gondii tachyzoites agglutinate in the presence of diluted sera containing IgG and IgM antibodies. However, the use of the direct agglutination test for the detection of IgM antibodies is controversial because of the lack of specificity. As a consequence, for each sample, the test was performed with addition of 2-mercaptoethanol (0.2 mol/L) which denaturates IgM antibodies. Sera and aqueous humors were diluted 2-fold starting at 1:8 dilution. IgG titres above 1:64 were considered positive.",

In our study, the C-value was not calculated because we did not have the opportunity to obtain the dosage of total antibody titres for all the animals we examined.
