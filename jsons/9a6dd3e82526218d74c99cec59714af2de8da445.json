Arguably, agricultural producers and the retail industry appear to be the best placed to weather the storm in order to respond to such a change in demand. However, this is overly simplistic. Recent news of empty shelves in supermarkets whilst dairy farmers have been forced to pour milk down the drain have gone viral.",

In particular, food democracy (sometimes also called \"food citizenship\" 2 ) provides a model for multilevel food governance to be followed post-coronavirus where a wide range of actors are involved in the design and delivery of future food systems. Consequently, this article highlights the challenges faced by the international trade in agricultural products (Section II) before indicating the dysfunctions within food supply chains from a national viewpoint (Section III) and how these issues (especially around food disruptions) can cause consumers to consider the sources of their food more carefully. 3 Most importantly, the pandemic emphasises the urgency to rebuild food systems based on a food democracy model (Section IV) before considering future developments (Section V).",

            "text": "Lockdowns worldwide have consequences on harvesting, production, processing, transport and logistics more generally for multiple reasons. The volume of production is negatively impacted globally. The number of employees who are self-isolating or unwell is increasing. Workplaces and spaces are being redesigned to accommodate social distancing requirements and putting in place more stringent handling procedures (including the purchase of employee personal protection equipment), whilst others are either closing for extended periods of time due to longer and deeper cleans or are planning temporary shutdowns due to staff shortages, in particular meat processing plants. 5 There is also an issue of increased food waste when containers or trucks are held up at borders. These factors are resulting in the rise of raw material prices due to discrepancies in supply and demand. This is the case in India where the prices of rice, wheat flour and pulses have risen. 6 Another issue that impacts on the production of food globally is the lack of seasonal workers to pick the fruits and vegetables in the fields due to border restrictions and travel bans. These agricultural workers are paramount to ensuring national and international food security, as they undertake highly skilled, difficult work. The European Union (EU), the UK, Canada and the USA are some of the countries particularly affected. 7 In the UK, around 80,000 seasonal employees are annually employed in the horticultural industry. 8 uk/cloud-nine-or-down-to-earth-the-implicationsof-a-no-deal-brexit-on-agriculture>. 9 S Lakner, \"Effects of Coronavirus on Agricultural Production -A First Approximation (part 2)\", Arc 2020, 6 April 2020 <https://www.arc2020.eu/effects-of-coronavirus-on-agricultural-production-a-first-approximation-part-2>.",

Many are now working in the UK or Germanythe latter needs 300,000 workers for the harvest season, such as to pick asparagus. 10 Some States are also considering export restrictions, whilst others have already put them in place to ensure stability and food security within their territory. These measures could create global food shortages, especially in poorer countries. 11 Some key staple foods are more affected than others. 12 For example, one of the top countries to produce rice, Vietnam, has temporarily ceased sales of new shipments. 13 Grain exporters, including Russia and Kazakhstan, have also suspended exports to ensure that their populations are nourished. 14 States stockpiling agricultural products could trigger increased price volatility. Such events recall the 2007-2008 world food prices peak and the resulting food insecurity crisis. 15 These restrictions are multiplying across the world despite a Joint Statement of the WTO, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) advising against such measures and stressing the importance to \"show solidarity, act responsibly and adhere to our common goal of enhancing food security, food safety and nutrition and improving the general welfare of people around the world\". 16 If the uptake of these export restrictions keeps growing, they could have ripple effects on the global food supply chain. They could contribute to food insecurity worldwidepotentially increasing insecurity in the longer term in the countries having imposed these protective measures. Despite the disruptions highlighted so far, the supply to current global markets remains adequate. 17 Nonetheless, a combination of all of these changes leads to increased prices for food businesses. These increased costs will be passed on to the costumers in the future (if not having done so already). 18 10 A K\u00fchnel, \"Germany Drafts Romanian Farm Labor for Coronavirus Pandemic\", Deutsche Welle, 8 April 2020 <https://www.dw.com/en/germany-drafts-romanian-farm-labor-for-coronavirus-pandemic/a-53066735>. 11 Under WTO law, such export restrictions could potentially be justified under Art XX (General Exceptions) (in particular Art XX (b) on measures to protect human health) and Art XXI (Security Exception) of the 1994 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The issue of their legality is beyond the scope of this manuscript. For more, see, eg, V Lapa, \"GATT Article XXI as a Way to Justify Food Trade Restrictions Adopted as a Response to COVID-19?\", Regulating for Globalization, 10 April 2020 <http://regulatingforglobalization.com/2020/04/10/gattarticle-xxi-as-a-way-to-justify-food-trade-restrictions-adopted-as-a-response-to-covid-19>. 12 The International Food Policy Research Institute has developed an excellent tracker of food export restrictions during the crisis; see D Laborde, \"Food Export Restrictions during the Covid-19 Crisis\", International Food Policy Research Institute, 2020 <https://public.tableau.com/profile/laborde6680#!/vizhome/ExportRestrictionsTracker/ FoodExportRestrictionsTracker>. 13 Bangkok Post, \"Vietnam Halts New Rice Export Contracts as it Reviews Stocks\", 25 March 2020 <https://www. bangkokpost.com/business/1886355/vietnam-halts-new-rice-export-contracts-as-it-reviews-stocks>. 14 A Pandey, \"Will Coronavirus Spark a Wave of Food Nationalism?\", Deutsche Welle, 30 March 2020 <https://www.dw.com/en/will-coronavirus-spark-a-wave-of-food-nationalism/a-52952081>. With the current context, the danger of going back to the old habits of high-input, high-output modes of productionwhereby external inputs (herbicides, pesticides, fertilisers) are utilised to increase the levels of food productionis growing and threatening the continuing turn towards sustainable agriculture. 19 However, at most this would likely be a short-term fix for food security, as sustainability is required in the long term. 20 The drive for sustainable agriculture must not be rolled back and should be prioritised, with renewed emphasis on tackling climate change and moving agriculture towards net-zero emissions by 2050. 21 Furthermore, many synthetic inputs are produced in China, 22 and due to the Chinese lockdown, their production has been disrupted, which could lead to some products being temporarily discontinued and intensification being challenged in the short term. The temptation to revert back to less environmentally friendly practices or to embrace novel food technologies, such as the genetic modification of crops and animals or animal cloning, should be carefully monitored and assessed. More positively, the COVID-19 crisis provides an opportunity to reconsider current agricultural approaches and to farm using greener techniques. The pandemic puts the resilience of the existing dominant food systems under strain at both international and national levels.",

They also have restricted the number of customers on the shop floor at any one time and implemented a \"one in, one out\" system. Because citizens are either on lockdown restrictions or have been told to stay at home as much as possible, more online orders are being placed, with citizens choosing home deliveries or \"click and collect\" 29 options. Again, supermarkets have had to adapt to the increasing online demand. Today, shop floors are packed with employees picking the products ordered by consumers to get online orders ready.

Some shelves are rarely replenished, and there is a lack of availability of certain products, especially baby formula and flour. In contrast, it has been reported throughout the world that dairy farmers are pouring perfectly safe milk down the drain. 31 Similarly, flour mills have been running at capacity for the last few weeks, yet flour does not seem to be back on the shelves. 32 This contrasts with the earlier statement that agricultural producers would be benefitting from the situation. 25 P Butler, \"Food Banks Ask UK Supermarkets to Set aside Coronavirus Supplies\", The Guardian, 21 March 2020 <https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/21/food-banks-plead-with-uk-supermarkets-to-set-aside-suppliesamid-coronavirus-fallout>. 26 J Swinnen, \"Will COVID-19 Cause another Food Crisis?

It is not due to the lack of demand in shops or the availability of the agricultural commodity, but to the (dis)organisation of the supply chains. To put it simply, the food supply chain is split between providing food for retail and for food service businesses (restaurants, cafes, fast food chains, delis, bars and pubs). The latter often buy in bulk (often tankers, large containers or bags), whilst the former only require reduced quantities in smaller packaging. The ongoing situation in shops indicates that the food supply chain is not equipped to adapt quickly to modified demand both in terms of increased quantities and sourcing the relevant containers or packaging. The availability of smaller containers for flour bags, milk cartons and even tinned food is insufficient to cope with the expanded demand in retail. 33 There is a lack of capacity for this type of demand. Another difference between retail and food service markets is the nature of the foods sold: the latter often attract more highend, gourmet products, such as prime cuts of meat, than the former, thus it is difficult to shift products from one to the other. These major shifts in consumption patterns are impacting on the resilience of all of the industries involved in food supply chains.",

There appears to be limited food security, as is demonstrated when the system is put under pressure. There is little resilience or flexibility, and this is partially linked to the weak position of farmers and the existence of long food supply chains. Often, citizens do not feel in control of the international food supply chain or food provenance. They feel like food choice is imposed by the supply chain. For example, in Wales it can be difficult from time to time to buy locally sourced Welsh produce, especially lamb, since 40% of it is exportedmostly to the EU (even when in season). 39 A food democracy model gives citizens opportunities to actively participate in how sustainable food systems are constructed in order to enable alternative perspectives on how food should be produced and consumed. The term \"food democracy\" was coined in the 1990s by Lang. 40 Food democracy creates a framework that is about building a transformative, alternative food system to empower citizens through choices and to allow them to find greater satisfaction in a food system that reflects shared values underpinning societies and that sells sustainable produce that people want. 41 These individual choices about where people buy food demonstrate \"the degree of control consumers can exert\" on food systems. 42 This model for multilevel food governance can be characterised as citizens wanting \"better food, more information and choices, and preference for local action and personal involvement\", 43 and it ought to be followed when rebuilding food supply chains.",

Many schemes were not able to accept new customers temporarily due to the swift increase in demand for local produce. The situation was similar for some local butchers who had to temporarily close 46 in order to move to deliveries and collections, whilst giving them time to improve their websites in order to enable such changes.

It is, however, not guaranteed that these positive shifts will be maintained post-pandemic. Further steps are required to strengthen democratic agri-food systems. In particular, financial agricultural support needs to be redesigned to support small, family farms to a greater extent in their role as local food producers. Farms, as small and medium-sized enterprises, are essential to rural vitality and the local economy. They can facilitate the establishment and flourishing of businesses and economic activities such as rural tourism, cultural services, recreational activities and access to local products, thereby providing local employment. Supporting the diversification of holdings and the development of cooperatives to take up not only production, but also processing and packaging on a small scale could improve the finances of their businesses, enhance access to food and strengthen a democratic agri-food system. Furthermore, small, family farms are stewards of the countryside and tend to be environmentally friendly by creating greater biodiversity and a wider range of habitats on the land through the use of extensive, alternative agricultural farming practices, 56 such as agroecology and agroforestry, 57 contributing to the strengthening of agri-food systems (characteristic iii). 58 Another step could be to integrate more fully food and agricultural policies. The current Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform and the ongoing UK and devolved consultations on future agricultural policies post-EU exit (including the 2020 Agriculture Bill) could create such frameworks and mechanisms. Currently, agricultural policy and food strategies are formulated in isolation from each other. 59 The European Green Deal, which includes a \"Farm to Fork Strategy\" that aims to strengthen the production of safe, nutritious food of high quality as well as increasing its sustainability, 60 will partially respond to this siloed approach. However, a more holistic approach between agriculture and food underpinned by a strong community focus should be adopted. The pandemic highlights the importance of formulating policies (and resulting bills) that combine both agricultural and food aspects.",

            "text": "With the breakdown of international trade because States are closing their borders to keep food supplies within their territory and companies either are closing or are not fully operational, food provisioning is becoming increasingly difficult. Existing weaknesses and tensions in complex, interconnected and global food supply chains have been exacerbated by COVID-19. Despite the multiplicity of farmers, bottlenecks in the food supply chain are often due to consolidation and integration within the industry because of the presence of a limited number of processing plants, abattoirs and retailers. In the UK, Brexit will potentially add another layer to the ongoing crisis since the future trading relationship with the EU remains uncertain.With the current changes in the food supply chain, food citizens are providing the impetus for change and have become empowered to influence and nurture better food provisioning to \"create a more sustainable and just society where the public can actively participate in the decision-making process for foods\". 61 The pandemic is creating a rare opportunity for radical change 62 to transform food supply chains and build resilient, sustainable and democratic agri-food systems (including in the design of financial agricultural support). Post-pandemic, food democracy generates a strong framework for multilevel food governance by putting the emphasis on local and regional production that encourages the consumption of seasonal and healthy produce (in combination with longer food supply chains and the provisioning of sustainable products), employing local agricultural workers and establishing better relationships between producers and retailers, whilst ensuring that the security and diversity of food are maintained. These modifications triggered by local, national and international factors ought to be reflected in the future policies of individual States and international organisations integrating food and agriculture, including the ongoing CAP reform, the 2020 UK Agriculture Bill and the Welsh, Northern Irish and Scottish visions for future agri-food systems.",
