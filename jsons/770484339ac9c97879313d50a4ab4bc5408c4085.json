Though COVID-19 pathology in children is typically mild compared to adults, approximately 10% of infants experience severe COVID-19 illness requiring advanced care (8, 9) . Importantly, as COVID-19 pathology does not correlate with transmissibility, infants and young children are likely responsible for a significant amount of SARS-CoV-2 dissemination (3) (4) (5) ; therefore, protecting this population from infection remains essential. One potential mechanism of protection might be passive immunity via breastfeeding by a previouslyinfected mother. If this response is potent, this is also relevant as a potential therapeutic. These milk antibodies (Abs) may be far more effective than convalescent plasma or immunoglobulin.",

Approximately 90% of human milk Ab is IgA and ~8% IgM, nearly all in secretory (s) form (sIgA/sIgM; polymeric antibodies (Abs) complexed to j-chain and secretory component (SC) proteins) (1, 2, 16) . Nearly all sIgA/sIgM derives from the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), though there is also homing of B cells from other mucosa (i.e. the respiratory system) to the mammary gland; therefore, we should expect some SARS-CoV-2specific sIgA/sIgM to be present in milk (1) . Importantly, in vivo studies have demonstrated that secretory Abs are durable, transit well to the mucosa after systemic administration, and are resistant to enzymatic degradation; therefore, should SARS-CoV-2-reactive Abs be produced at high titer after infection, these predominantly secretory-type Abs have great potential as a COVID-19 therapeutic (2, 6).",

Human milk Ab is ~90% IgA and 8% IgM, nearly all sIgA/sIgM. These polymeric Abs are complexed to SC, which is the cleavage product of the pIgR that marks these secretory-type Abs as it transports them into the milk (1). SC is essential for the survival of secretory Abs in relatively harsh mucosal environments such as the infant gut where they would otherwise succumb quickly to proteolytic degradation (1). The B cells that ultimately produce milk sIgA/sIgM originate mainly from the GALT, known as the entero-mammary link, with some proportion originating from other mucosa such as the respiratory system (1, 19, 20) . Evidence supporting this enteromammary link include the finding that mammary gland B cells display an adhesion receptor profile matching that found on GALT B cells, and that milk sIgA exhibits high reactivity for enteric antigens compared to blood (21) (22) (23) (24) . In fact, PRM/Alf mice (possessing elongated intestinal tracts) have been shown to exhibit increased gut-derived B cells in the mammary gland and increased milk sIgA concentration compared to wild type mice (25) . As such, there is much precedent for milk Ab composition and specificity being unique from that found in blood, as the data presented here suggests. Though we did not compare the milk donors' blood Ab titers to the milk data, it was evident that most of the samples contained SARS-CoV-2-reactive IgA without necessarily containing measurable IgG and/or IgM, which particularly in the case of IgG, would likely be derived in large part from the serum. Notably, IgG and IgM reactivities in undiluted milk exhibited a moderate correlation. It may also be that as total IgG and IgM are so much lower in milk than IgA, that this ELISA lacked the sensitivity to pick up low-titer responses.",

Though it has been determined by previous studies that most IgA in human milk is sIgA, our ELISA could not determine with certainty that the IgA (or IgM) measured was of the secretory type or not (1) . The assay measuring secretory Ab reactivity employs a secondary Ab specific for the SC, which can be free, or bound to Ab. Notable, all samples exhibiting positive IgA reactivity also exhibited positive SC reactivity, and a very strong positive correlation was present when comparing the OD values of undiluted milk for the IgA and SC assays. This suggests that a very high proportion of the SARS-CoV-2-reactive IgA measured herein was sIgA. This is extremely relevant to the possibility of using purified milk Ab as a COVID-19 therapy, as this sIgA-dominant milk Ab is highly unique from the IgG-dominant convalescent plasma or purified plasma immunoglobulin being tested currently. This sIgA-rich therapeutic would likely survive well upon targeted respiratory administration, where a much lower dose of Ab might be needed for efficacy compared to that used systemically. Moreover, non-human primate studies have found that dimeric IgA given systemically transits well to mucosal compartments, and maintains high levels in blood for a significantly longer period after administration compared to IgG or monomeric IgA (6).",

Plates were developed with TMB reagent followed by HCl and read at 450nm on an ELISA plate reader.ResultsMost milk (80%) obtained post-COVID-19-recovery exhibits IgA reactivity to RBD. Fifteen milk samples obtained from donors previously-infected with SARS-CoV-2 as well as 10 samples obtained as part of other studies prior to December 2019 were tested in duplicate in 3 unique experiments for separate assays measuring IgA, IgG, IgM, and secretory-type Ab reactivity (the secondary Ab used in this assay is specific for free and bound SC). The 10 pre-pandemic control undiluted milk samples were used to determine positive cutoff values for each assay, calculated as the mean OD + 2*SD. These control samples exhibited some low-level reactivity in all 4",
