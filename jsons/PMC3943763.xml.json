            "text": "As a mechanism of intrinsic defense against invading pathogens, the host innate immune system is equipped with germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). These evolutionary conserved receptors are fundamental in the recognition of microbial pathogens including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites. They distinguish host components from pathogens by detecting moieties that are conserved within a class of pathogens known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and initiate signaling cascades that culminate in the expression of antimicrobial products and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [1], [2], [3]. These antigen-independent innate immune responses act within hours and are at the frontline of the battle against invaders. No less important, they help instruct the development of a more time-consuming, antigen-specific adaptive immunity that often is pivotal for pathogen clearance and long-term immune memory.",

            "text": "Although vertebrate hosts encode several other classes of PRRs such as the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), NOD-like receptors, C-type lectin receptors, and sequestosome 1/p62-like receptors [4], [5], Toll-like receptors (TLRs) were the first to be identified and have been most thoroughly studied. First acknowledged in Drosophila, the Toll receptor was shown to be important for host defense against fungal infection [6]. Subsequently, 10 human (TLR1\u2013TLR10) and 12 mouse (TLR1\u2013TLR9 and TLR11\u2013TLR13) homologs to the Toll receptor in Drosophila were characterized hence named TLRs [2], [7]. All of the TLRs are type I transmembrane proteins that are composed of an amino-terminal leucine-rich repeat-containing ectodomain responsible for PAMP recognition, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic carboxy-terminal Toll-interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) homology (TIR) domain that activates downstream signal transduction [8], [9]. Based on sequence homology, the vertebrate TLRs are classified into six major families, that is, TLR1, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR7, and TLR11 [10]. The TLR1 family encompasses TLR1, TLR2, TLR6, and TLR10. These reside on plasma membranes and recognize components of microbial cell walls and membranes such as lipoproteins and peptidoglycans. They function as a heterodimeric receptor, with TLR2 paired with one of the rest of the TLR1 family members. TLR4 and TLR5 also localize to plasma membrane and engage bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and flagellin, respectively [2]. On the contrary, members of the TLR3, TLR7, and TLR11 families are intracellular TLRs expressed in endosomes and lysosomes. Initially localizing to the endoplasmic reticulum after their synthesis, these TLRs depend on UNC93B1, a polytopic membrane protein for transport to endolysosomal compartments where they are processed by proteases to become functional receptors [11]. TLR3 recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) [12]. TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 make up the TLR7 family, with TLR7 and TLR8 detecting single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) while TLR9 engaging unmethylated CpG DNA [2]. In the TLR11 family, TLR11 and TLR12 operate as a heterodimer for sensing profilin from the parasite Toxoplasma gondii\n[13], while TLR13 detects bacterial 23S ribosomal RNA [14], [15].",

Among these, TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 detect distinct forms of viral nucleic acids and are critical in the recognition of viral genetic materials in endolysosomal compartments and initiate antiviral responses. TLR2 and TLR4 are two additional TLR family members that have been implicated in the recognition of viral structural and nonstructural proteins leading to inflammatory cytokine production [20], [21], [22], [23]. There is also evidence that TLR13 may recognize viral infection such as that by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), although the exact PAMP sensed by TLR13 in this case remains unknown [24]. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the roles of TLRs and their pathways in innate antiviral immunity. We discuss examples of TLR-mediated viral recognition and describe strategies evolved by viruses to circumvent host antiviral innate immune responses triggered by TLRs.",

            "text": "In response to viral infection, the host rapidly launches an innate immune response characterized by the production of IFNs and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in efforts to prevent virus replication and eliminate the invader. IFNs act in a paracrine/autocrine fashion to activate the JAK-STAT pathways, upregulating the transcription of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes, many of which possess broad antiviral activities. This reins in viral multiplication in infected cells and establishes an antiviral state in uninfected neighboring cells. In addition, IFNs activate various innate immune cells and immune effector cells, facilitating the development of adaptive immune responses [25]. Although most do not have direct antiviral effects, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines orchestrate the maturation of innate and adaptive immune cells and play a key role in their recruitment to the site of infection. Based on receptor usage, IFNs are classified into three types, type I (IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b1), type II (IFN-\u03b3), and type III [IFN-\u03bb1 (IL-29), IFN-\u03bb2 (IL-28A), and IFN-\u03bb3 (IL-28B)] IFNs [25]. Gene knockout studies in mice have established a predominant role for type I IFNs in protecting against many different viruses in vivo\n[26]. They have also revealed that type III IFNs play a crucial part in antiviral defenses of epithelial surface of respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts [27], [28]. Infants with homozygous mutations in the STAT1 allele producing a STAT1 deficiency died of a lethal virus-induced disease, illustrating the importance of the IFN system in control of viral infections in humans [29].",

The induction of these antiviral responses shares overlapping regulatory mechanisms and is dependent upon coordinated activation of the latent cytosolic transcriptional factors such as the IFN regulatory factors (IRFs), mainly IRF3 and IRF7, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB). Among these, NF-\u03baB and IRF3 are constitutively expressed. In contrast, IRF7 expression is initially weak except in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) but enhanced significantly upon stimulation by viruses or other stimuli such as type I IFNs. In resting cells, NF-\u03baB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by a member of the I\u03baB family of inhibitory proteins. Upon a variety of stimuli, such as viruses, TNF\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2, the classical I\u03baB kinase (IKK) complex composed of IKK\u03b1, IKK\u03b2, and IKK\u03b3 (also known as NEMO) is activated, which in turn phosphorylates I\u03baB, leading to I\u03baB polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. As a result, NF-\u03baB is liberated and migrates into the nucleus whereby it binds and activates target gene promoters such as those of IFN-\u03b2 and numerous cytokines [31], [32]. Although NF-\u03baB contributes to IFN induction, its main role is in the induction of proinflammatory cytokines. Viral activation of the IRFs, however, requires specific phosphorylations within their C-terminal parts by the IKK-related kinases, TBK1 or IKK\u03b5, in a complex containing IKK\u03b3 and TANK [33], [34], [35], [36]. This results in homodimerization or heterodimerization of IRF3 and/or IRF7 and subsequent nuclear translocation to bind to type I and type III IFN promoters. In general, IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb1 promoters are predominantly activated by IRF3, while transcription of the IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb2/3 relies more upon IRF7 [37], [38], [39]. Collectively, the IRFs and NF-\u03baB transcription factors are major regulators of antiviral and inflammatory gene expression.",

            "text": "Upstream, several TLR signaling pathways mediate cell-type-specific regulation of IFN and/or inflammatory cytokine production in response to viral infections through activation of these essential transcription factors (Fig. 1\n). These include pathways initiated via TLR3, TLR7/TLR8/TLR9, TLR4, and TLR2. The specific response following engagement of the individual TLR, however, is determined by the subcellular compartment where the signal is initiated and by the TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein that is recruited. While activation of TLR signaling in endosomes can lead to either IFN or inflammatory cytokine induction, signaling from cell-surface-localized TLRs only results in inflammatory responses but not IFN expression. This may be explained by the proposal that TRAF3, a cytosolic adaptor essential for IFN induction via TLR and RLR signaling pathways [40], [41], does not have ready access to plasma membrane signaling complexes [42]. Based on usage of the two major TIR-domain-containing adaptors, the TLR signaling pathways are classified into MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent pathways. The former is used by all TLRs but TLR3, while the latter is triggered by TLR3 or TLR4. Of note, two additional TIR-domain-containing adaptors, MyD88-like (MAL, also known as TIRAP) and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM, also known as TICAM2), are required for bridging MyD88 to TLR2 and TLR4 and TRIF to TLR4, respectively. As described below, signaling through the TRIF-dependent pathways leads to the production of IFNs and inflammatory cytokines, while activation of the MyD88-dependent pathways culminates in induction of inflammatory cytokines, with the exception that, in specific immune cell types, it also results in IFN induction [2], [43], [44].",

Downstream signaling molecules such as kinases IRAK4, IRAK1, and ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 are recruited to MyD88 causing activation of a protein kinase complex consisting of TAK1. Upon activation, TAK1 phosphorylates IKK\u03b2 in the classical IKK complex ultimately resulting in the activation NF-\u03baB and the subsequent expression of proinflammatory cytokines [2]. It should be noted that, however, in specific immune cell subsets such as the pDCs, which are known as professional IFN-producing cells, the MyD88-dependent pathways can lead to induction of copious amounts of type I IFNs upon TLR7 and TLR9 sensing of viral components in endolysosomal compartments. This requires recruitment of TRAF3 and IKK\u03b1 to the MyD88\u2013IRAK\u2013TRAF6 complex and subsequent phosphorylation of IRF7 by IRAK1 and IKK\u03b1 [50], [51]. As another example, inflammatory monocytes can recognize virion components of certain viruses such as vaccinia virus via a TLR2-MyD88-dependent pathway, resulting in expression of type I IFNs in addition to inflammatory cytokines. Although the detailed underlying mechanism remains elusive, TLR2-mediated IFN production but not TNF induction in this cell type depends on trafficking of this TLR to endosomes and on transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7 [43]. Interestingly, other IRF family members such as IRF1 and IRF8 have also been reported to participate in MyD88-dependent pathways leading to IFN induction in dendritic cell (DC) subsets [52], [53].",

As such, TLR3 has been shown to sense infections by dsRNA viruses, ssRNA viruses, and DNA viruses [2]. In addition, the TLR3 signaling pathway is stimulated by a synthetic dsRNA analog, polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid (poly I:C) [12]. Engagement of TLR3 with synthetic or viral dsRNAs activates the TRIF-dependent pathway, culminating in the induction of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and type I and type III IFNs mediated by NF-\u03baB and IRF3 activation [12], [54], [55], [56], [57], [58]. in vitro binding assays have revealed that the smallest dsRNA oligonucleotides capable of binding to a dimeric unit of TLR3 ectodomain are 40\u201350 bp long. However, only dsRNA ligands of 90 bp or longer activate TLR3 signaling in endosomes [59], the typical intracellular compartment where TLR3 resides in most cell types. Consistent with this, it has been found that dsRNA replicative intermediates of hepatitis C virus (HCV), a hepatotropic flavivirus, are required to have a minimal length of 80\u2013100 bp to activate TLR3-dependent chemokine expression in hepatocytes [60].",

            "text": "TLR3 has a relatively wide tissue distribution, with its transcripts detected in many human and mouse tissues such as the placenta, lung, liver, heart, lymph node, spleen, and brain [12], [61], [62], [63], [64]. TLR3 protein is expressed by key sentinel cells of the innate immune system such as conventional dendritic cells and macrophages and non-immune cells including epithelial cells, natural killer cells, fibroblasts, astrocytes, hepatocytes, and endothelial cells [56], [57], [61], [63], [65], [66]. In contrast, TLR3 is absent from pDCs where TLR7 and TLR9 are present in high quantities. Likewise, TLR3 expression is absent in neutrophils and minimally expressed in T cells [67], [68]. This suggests that the versatility of antiviral immune responses may be mediated at least in part by the differential expressions of TLRs on specific cell types. With the exception that, in fibroblasts and some epithelial cells, it can be expressed on cell surface, TLR3 is localized in endosomes in most cell types [69] and signaling through this TLR is dependent on vaculolar acidification [60], [66], [69]. Unlike other intracellular TLRs whose localization is dictated by the transmembrane domain, TLR3 position in intracellular endosomes is dependent on a cytoplasmic linker region between the TIR domain and the transmembrane domain [70]. Interestingly, it has also been observed that TLR3 preferentially resides near phagosomes containing apoptotic cell particles, raising the possibility that the fusion of phagosomes with nearby endosomes may enable TLR3 recognition of dsRNA from apoptotic cells, such as those infected by viruses [70]. This mechanism could explain TLR3-mediated cross-priming of cytotoxic T lymphocytes by murine CD8alpha + DCs against viruses that do not directly infect these DCs [71]. Thus, in specific subsets of DCs, the role of TLR3 appears to shift from regulating proinflammatory and IFN antiviral responses to mediating the adaptive immune responses.",

            "text": "TLR3 has been demonstrated to serve as an essential PRR that detects and fends off some invading viral pathogens. However, the complexities of TLR3 signaling lies in the fact that TLR3's functional role can either mediate the establishment of an antiviral state in efforts to prevent virus replication and mitigate disease severity or facilitate an excessive and unregulated immune response to the infection that can be harmful to the host and may contribute to the severity of the disease. The importance of TLR3 in mediating the antiviral host defense has been exemplified in a number of in vivo and in vitro studies. Mice lacking TLR3 or bearing a lethal mutation in TRIF are hypersusceptible to mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV), demonstrating a 1000-fold increase in spleen viral titers concomitant with diminished IFN levels in serum, when compared to wild-type mice [72], [73]. This hypersusceptible phenotype caused by TLR3 deficiency is also seen in mice infected by another DNA virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV) 2, with TLR3 knockout mice developing a more pronounced disease in the central nervous system (CNS) than wild-type mice or mice deficient in other TLRs [74]. In the absence of TLR3, astrocytes were unable to sense HSV-2 infection and produce IFN-\u03b2 immediately after entry of the virus into the CNS, resulting in uncontrolled viral replication and spread. A protective role of TLR3 against HSV-1 has also been suggested in humans. Children born with deficiencies in the TLR3 pathway have a predisposition for HSV-1-induced encephalitis, a severe viral infection of the CNS [75], [76], [77], [78]. In addition, TLR3 has been found to mediate protection against various RNA virus infections. Following poliovirus infection, serum IFN production was abolished in TLR3 and TRIF knockout mice, and both the viral load in non-neural tissues and mortality rates were strikingly higher than those in wild-type mice [79]. TLR3 signaling also lessens the virulence of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and mediates the protection of the heart during virally induced injury [80]. In comparison to wild-type mice, TLR3-deficient mice were more susceptible to EMCV infection, having higher viral loads in the heart and liver, and impaired cytokine and chemokine responses in the heart were observed [80]. These mice also succumb to EMCV infection earlier than the wild-type mice [80]. Similar findings have been reported in TLR3 knockout mice infected with Coxsackievirus B3 or B4 [81], [82]. In a mouse model orally infected with rotavirus, a dsRNA virus responsible for viral diarrhea worldwide, it was shown that TLR3-mediated innate immunity contributed to restricting the virus replication in adult but not neonate animals. Specifically, TLR3 or TRIF deficiency in adult mice resulted in significantly increased viral shedding and decreased induction of antiviral and proinflammatory genes in intestinal epithelial cells [83]. The contribution of TLR3 to antiviral immunity has also been demonstrated in in vitro settings. TLR3 is capable of sensing HCV and dengue virus in cell culture, initiating an IFN response that restricts the replication of these flaviviruses [63], [84]. Knockdown of TLR3 in A549 cells abrogated pathogenic Hantaan virus-induced expression of MxA, a well-established marker for IFN production, concomitant with increased viral replication [85]. Furthermore, initiating antiviral immune responses with TLR3 agonists has been shown to provide protection from many different viruses including hepatitis B virus, influenza virus, certain human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) strains, and coronaviruses [86], [87], [88], [89], [90].",

            "text": "Although these aforementioned studies illustrate that TLR3-mediated antiviral response is beneficial in protecting the host against viruses, the activation of TLR3 signaling has also been observed to be deleterious in some other viral infections. Following the Phlebovirus Punta Toro virus infection, TLR3 knockout mice showed increased resistance to lethal infection and had a reduced liver disease associated with Punta Toro virus infection compared to wild-type mice. Evidence suggested that the phenotype was due to higher levels of inflammatory responses observed in wild-type mice than TLR3 null mice, signifying that an unregulated inflammatory response may mediate much of the damage demonstrated [91]. A detrimental role for TLR3-mediated inflammatory responses in influenza virus-induced acute pneumonia has also been reported. Despite harboring higher levels of viral replication in the lungs, TLR3 knockout mice survived influenza A virus infection better than wild-type mice because they produced significantly reduced levels of inflammatory mediators and had a lower frequency of CD8 + T cells in the bronchoalveolar airspace [92]. Likewise, TLR3-deficient mice infected with the DNA vaccinia virus exhibited lessen severity of disease and decreased mortality, concomitant with production of lower levels of inflammatory cytokines in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [93]. Furthermore, TLR3-mediated inflammatory responses facilitated West Nile virus (WNV) entry into CNS via destruction of the blood brain barrier resulting in lethal encephalitis [94]. However, the role of TLR3 in WNV infection appears to differ depending on infection model, being protective in another study [95]. Overall, TLR3-induced antiviral responses to viruses may be beneficial or harmful to the host. However, the host defense system is unique in that it has evolved to equip with other TLRs or other classes of PRRs that act in concert in mediating antiviral responses [96].",

Like TLR3 and TLR9 (see below), recognition of viral ligands in the endosome by TLR7/TLR8 is dependent on acidification of the endosomal vesicles [99]. Through this pathway, TLR7 and TLR8 are able to detect GU-rich and AU-rich ssRNA sequences of RNA viruses [97], [99], [100]. Upon engagement of ssRNAs in endosomes, these antiviral sensors initiate the MyD88-dependent pathway, culminating in synthesis of type I and type III IFNs and proinflammatory mediators via activation of IRF7 and NF-\u03baB, respectively, depending on the cell type [101], [102], [103]. Based on evolutionary similarities, it has been understood that TLR9 forms a subfamily with TLR7 and TLR8, now known as the TLR7 subfamily [10], [104], [105]. However, because both TLR7 and TLR8 respond to single-stranded viral nucleic acids, they are commonly linked together; however, there are functional differences between the two [106], [107].",

The basis of this regulation lies in the fact that, like TLR9 (see below), TLR7 is predominately expressed in these specialized cell types, and to some extent, expression is detected in other immune cell types, such as B cells and monocytes/macrophages [44], [61], [108], [109], [110], [111]. On the other hand, TLR8 is known to primarily be expressed in monocytes/macrophages and myeloid dendritic cells [61], [110], [112]. In these cell types, TLR8 signaling mainly results in NF-\u03baB activation and subsequent inflammatory cytokine expression [44]. Until recently, TLR8-mediated antiviral responses were only acknowledged in humans and, generally, murine TLR8 was thought to be incapable of mediating responses to TLR7/TLR8 agonist or TLR8 ligands [107], [113]. However, a recent report described murine TLR8 activation in response to viral stimuli [114]. Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to further clarify the functionality of mouse TLR8 in mediating the antiviral response.",

In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, TLR7 and TLR8 responded to various imidazoquinoline molecules by producing different degrees of proinflammatory and IFN-induced cytokines responses [115]. Since then the roles TLR7 and TLR8 play in antiviral immunity have been characterized, they are now known to serve as endosomal PRRs for a number of ssRNA viruses including influenza, HIV-1, VSV, Sendai virus, Coxsackie B virus, coronaviruses (mouse hepatitis virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus), and flaviviruses (HCV, dengue virus, and WNV) [97], [100], [116], [117], [118], [119], [120], [121], [122], [123]. While the canonical antiviral mechanism of TLR7 signaling involves IFN induction in pDCs, as demonstrated in studies conducted in mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus [122], pneumonia virus of mouse [124], and so on, pDC-independent and IFN-independent immune mechanisms downstream of the TLR7-MyD88 axis have recently surfaced. In one study, it was found that TLR7-deficient or MyD88-deficient mice were more susceptible to lethal West Nile encephalitis than wild-type controls. The increased viremia and elevated brain viral burden in the TLR7 or MyD88 knockout animals were attributed to reduced IL-23 response in resident tissue macrophages, which led to compromised immune cell homing to infected target cells [121]. Another study showed that TLR7 sensed two mouse retroviruses, mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) and Moloney murine leukemia virus upon their cellular entry, leading to MyD88-dependent neutralizing antibody production that was crucial for viral clearance [125].",

Three different pathways have been proposed. The first one, also known as the exogenous pathway, depends on endocytosis and protease-mediated degradation of incoming virions [97], [99]. It is known to be utilized by viruses such as influenza and VSV. However, for viruses that enter host cells by direct membrane fusion, a second pathway exists. This mechanism operates through autophagy, which transports cytoplasmic viral ssRNAs to endolysosomes. Viruses that can be sensed via this mechanism include paramyxoviruses (Sendai virus and simian virus 5), VSV, and HIV [126], [127], [128], [129]. In the studies on simian virus 5 and HIV-1, siRNA technology and/or chemical inhibitors were employed to demonstrate the dependence on the autophagy pathway for TLR7-mediated induction of IFN-\u03b1 and/or pDC maturation marker expression. In addition, although studying different viruses, both studies concluded that active viral replication is dispensable for activation of the autophagy-dependent TLR7 RNA sensing pathway in pDCs [128], [129]. Interestingly, in addition to contributing to viral RNA sensing, autophagy is also an important cellular antiviral mechanism downstream of TLR8 signaling. It was observed in human macrophages that TLR8 activation by ssRNA or imidazoquinolines stimulated a vitamin D and cathelicidin microbial peptide-dependent induction of autophagy, which resulted in inhibition of HIV-1 infection [130].",

This response was found to be dependent on cell-to-cell contact and mediated by transfer of viral RNA-containing exosomes from the donor cells to pDCs in contact, followed by activation of the TLR7 pathway in pDCs [131]. Remarkably, this cell-to-cell RNA transfer to activate TLR7 signaling in pDCs is not confined to HCV, as also observed when the donor cells were replicating an alphavirus (Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus) replicon [123]. In addition, this innate sensing mechanism appears to operate in HIV infection. In a recent study, it was observed that HIV-infected lymphocytes were more potent IFN inducers than cell-free HIV virions when used to stimulate pDCs. Viral RNAs transmitted via cell-to-cell contacts activated IFN production in pDCs through TLR7 [132]. This study also demonstrated that replication-defective viruses in donor cells stimulated the response in pDCs as potently as wild-type virus, suggesting that this cell-to-cell viral RNA detection mechanism, like the exogenous and autophagy-dependent pathways, also does not require active viral replication. This is remarkably similar to what is known about viral DNA detection by TLR9 (see below). Taken together, the multi-faceted mechanisms of viral RNA sensing by TLR7 in pDCs are vivid demonstrations of the complexity of the host innate immune system in detecting and combating invading viruses.",

TLR9 can also be stimulated by three different classes of synthetic CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) mediating type I IFN production and B cell activation [135], [136]. Although frequently observed in bacterial and viral DNA, in most instances, mammalian DNA is methylated, this feature is one way that TLR9 discriminates between pathogen-derived DNA and host DNA. However, the discrimination between self and foreign nucleic acids not only is dependent on recognition of distinct features but also requires the ability of TLR9 to distinctively encounter foreign nucleic acids. Like the other intracellular TLRs, TLR9 localizes within the endoplasmic reticulum, endosomes, and lysosomes [137]. The compartmentalization of TLR9 facilitates the interaction with foreign DNA and decreases the risk of contact with self DNA that could ultimately lead to the development of autoimmune diseases. In experiments relocating TLR9 to the cell surface by altering the membrane spanning domain with that of TLR4 consequently, stimulated TLR9 mediated immune responses to self DNA [138]. As in the case of TLR3, TLR7, and TLR8, endosomal acidification is also fundamental for ligand recognition and TLR9-mediated antiviral responses [139].",

Mutations in the receptor domain of TLR9 abolished its ability to recognize CpG oligonucleotides following MCMV infection [73]. Also, in response to MCMV infection, pDCs derived from TLR9 knockout mice were incapable of mounting a robust IFN-\u03b1 response [73]. Likewise, following MCMV infection, mice with genetic alterations in their TLR9 gene lost the ability to secrete type I IFNs, activate natural killer cells, and were highly susceptible to the infection [73]. Varicella zoster virus and cytomegalovirus trigger IFN-\u03b1 production via the TLR9-dependent pathway [144], [145]. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infects pDCs, upregulating CD83 and CD86 expression and stimulating IFN-\u03b1 production in these cells through TLR9 signaling [146]. TLR9 also recognizes adenovirus genomic DNA [147]. However, cooperative signaling by TLR2 and TLR9 is essential for antiviral responses against adenoviruses and EBV [148]. This dual cooperative signaling among TLR9 and TLR2 is also seen in HSV infection [149]. In contrast, nearly complete dependence on TLR9 signaling for antiviral protection was observed in mice infected a mouse poxvirus, ectromelia virus [142], [143]. In these studies, mice deficient for TLR9 were found to be > 100-fold more susceptible to lethal challenge by ectromelia virus than wild-type control animals.",

Classified in the Parvoviridae family bearing ssDNA genomes, adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) have been widely used as vectors for in vivo gene therapy. Host immune responses, however, limit the efficacy of AAV vector-mediated gene transfer. Recently, it has been shown that AAV vectors activate pDCs via the TLR9-MyD88 pathway to produce type I IFNs, which drive up both CD8 + T cell and antibody responses leading to loss of transgene expression in vivo\n[150]. Two rodent parvoviruses, minute virus of mice and its rat homolog H-1PV, were also found to stimulate human peripheral blood mononuclear cells to produce IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b1 in a TLR9-dependent fashion, presumably by acting on pDCs [151]. These studies thus have suggested a role for TLR9 in sensing parvoviruses. However, another study found that pDCs failed to elicit an IFN response following stimulation by wild-type AAV type 2 or minute virus of mice, although they responded to purified viral genomic ssDNA [152].",

Like all TLRs except TLR3, ligand recognition by TLR2 recruits the signaling adaptor molecule MyD88. An additional adaptor protein MAL is required for the interaction of TLR2 to MyD88 [159], acting as a linking adaptor via its TIR domain [9], [160]. In most cell types, engagement of TLR2 activates the classical MyD88-dependent pathway that relays signal through the IRAK family of proteins, TRAF6, and TAK1, leading to activation of the IKK complex and subsequent NF-\u03baB activation. The outcome is the induction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines [161]. That said, TLR2 has long considered not to be linked to IFN production. Nonetheless, TLR2 was surprisingly found to contribute to IFN-\u03b1/IFN-\u03b2 production in the spleens of mice infected with MCMV [162]. Data from a recent study helped explain this seemingly contradictory finding. It was found that a specific lineage of monocytes called inflammatory monocytes are able to sense vaccine virus and MCMV via TLR2, leading to type I IFN production. Although the detailed signaling mechanism is unclear, IFN induction requires TLR2 internalization and is dependent upon the MyD88 adaptor and the IRF3 and IRF7 transcription factors [43].",

            "text": "Studies conducted in mice have shown that TLR2 contributes to antiviral immunity that protects the host against infections by RSV, MCMV, and vaccinia virus. TLR2, working with TLR6, mediate innate immunity against RSV infection in mice by promoting leukocytes production of inflammatory mediators. This response was found to be crucial for suppressing viral replication in the lungs [171]. TLR2 knockout mice supported significantly higher levels of MCMV replication in spleen and liver than control mice due to decreased NK cell recruitment to both organs and reduced type I IFN expression in the spleen [162]. A protective role of TLR2 in vaccinia virus infection was demonstrated by the finding that TLR2 deficiency leads to elevated viral titers in the ovary [168]. Offering an explanation to the findings of the latter two studies, Barbalat et al. recently discovered that inflammatory monocytes recognize vaccinia virus and MCMV via TLR2, leading to IRF3/IRF7-dependent type I IFN production. Importantly, these authors showed that mice depleted of inflammatory monocytes prior to vaccinia virus infection had higher titers of virus in the livers and ovaries, demonstrating the critical role of this unusual TLR2 signaling pathway in this specific immune cell type in protecting against vaccinia virus infection [43]. In contrast to the findings with these aforementioned viruses, the picture of TLR2 in protective immunity against HSV is less clear. Two studies have reported that TLR2 acts in concert with TLR9 to stimulate innate antiviral responses, thereby protecting against brain infection of HSV-1 [172] and HSV-2 [149]. In contrast, others found a detrimental role of TLR2 in HSV-1 infection, showing that TLR2 mediates a deregulated inflammatory response to the virus that contributes to lethal encephalitis [173], [174]. Differences in virus strains, infection routes, and so on used in these studies could have led to the contradictory results observed.",

It was also the first TLR shown to respond to viral pathogens. This study described a TLR4-mediated induction of IL-6 in response to respiratory syncytial membrane bound fusion (F) protein [22]. Unlike TLR2, TLR4 function is not dependent on forming heterodimers with additional TLRs. Instead, interactions with MD-2, an extracellular molecule, are required for TLR4-mediated host immune responses to its major ligand LPS [176], [177]. MD-2 deficiency in mice augments susceptibility to infection and diminishes their response to LPS [176]. Furthermore, cells lacking MD-2 limited TLR4 to the Golgi apparatus, whereas in wild-type cells, TLR4 localized on the cells plasma membrane, validating the importance of MD-2 in TLR4 localization and recognition of LPS [176].",

However, unlike TLR2, TLR4 can also signal through the TRIF-dependent pathway after its endocytosis and trafficking to the endosome, where it recruits TRIF through TRAM [42]. The TLR4-TRAM-TRIF branch results in late-phase NF-\u03baB activation, as well as IRF3 activation and subsequent type I IFN expression.

            "text": "Since the first report describing TLR4's role as a sensor for recognition of RSV F protein, several other studies have further expanded the list of viruses TLR4 can respond to. A number of viral glycoproteins have been shown to act as viral PAMPs that bind to and activate TLR4, leading to IFN-\u03b2 and/or proinflammatory cytokine expression. Examples are VSV-G [178], Ebola virus GP [179], the envelope proteins of murine retroviruses MMTV, Moloney murine leukemia virus [180], and so on. Pretreatment with TLR4 ligands protects mice against infections by influenza virus [181], SARS coronavirus [90], and HSV-2 [182], suggesting that TLR4 signaling can induce protective antiviral immunity. However, data on whether TLR4 signaling in the context of viral infection is beneficial to the host or the virus are mixed, depending on the virus studied. A protective role of TLR4 was demonstrated in infections by KSHV, vaccinia virus, and RSV. It has been shown that mouse macrophages deficient in TLR4 expression were more susceptible to KSHV infection and that HIV patients bearing a mutant TLR4 allele were more likely to contract multicentric Castleman's disease, a lymphoproliferation due to enhanced KSHV replication [183]. Following pulmonary infection of vaccinia virus, mice lacking TLR4 or TRIF supported greater viral replication and had greater hypothermia and mortality than control animals [184]. Compared to wild-type controls, TLR4 knockout mice supported significantly higher levels of RSV replication in the lungs [171]. In contrast, TLR4 signaling appears to promote MMTV replication in mice by mediating the induction of IL-10 allowing the virus to persist indefinitely [185]. It also upregulates the expression of MMTV entry receptor on DCs [186]. Another study suggested that the TLR4-TRIF-TRAF6 axis contributes to oxidative stress and detrimental lung inflammation following challenge with inactivated H5N1 avian influenza virus. Accordingly, deletion of TLR4 or TRIF rendered mice resistant to H5N1 virus-induced acute lung injury [187]. In line with this report, others found that TLR4-deficient mice were protected from lethal infection by H1N1 influenza compared with wild-type controls [188].",

Viruses accomplish this either by cleaving cellular substrates using virally encoded proteases or by usurping the host proteasome degradation pathway. Given its broad recognition of dsRNAs produced during infections by both RNA and DNA viruses, the TLR3 pathway is frequently targeted for viral inhibition. Its sole adaptor, TRIF, has emerged as a prime target for degradation by different viruses. The NS3/4A serine protease of HCV and the 3C proteases of several picornaviruses, Coxsackievirus B, enterovirus 71 (EV71), and hepatitis A virus (HAV), all recognize TRIF as a substrate for proteolytic cleavage, producing TRIF fragments that are unable to signal [189], [190], [191], [192]. Interestingly, in the case of HAV, it is the 3CD processing intermediate but not the mature 3C protease that is capable of TRIF cleavage. Notably, targeting TRIF for immune evasion is not confined to positive-strand RNA viruses; it has been observed that, during lytic infection with KSHV, a human \u03b3-herpesvirus, TRIF protein levels were significantly downregulated. This was mediated by the KSHV immediate early transcription factor RTA (replication and transcription activator), which de-stabilized and targeted TRIF for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [193]. Since TRIF operates in the pathway before the signaling bifurcation, downregulation of TRIF enables viral inhibition of both IRF3 and NF-\u03baB arms of the innate immune responses. MyD88 and MAL are also subject to viral destruction. The immediate early ICP0 protein of HSV-1 promotes proteasomal degradation of these two TLR adaptors, thereby inhibiting TLR2-dependent NF-\u03baB activation and inflammatory cytokine production [194]. Unfortunately, signaling components downstream of the TLR adaptors and even the transcription factors are not spared from viral degradation. IKK\u03b3 (also known as NEMO), which is the regulatory subunit of the IKK complex bridging IRF and NF-\u03baB activation pathways, is proteolytically cleaved and inactivated by the 3C protease of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) [195], a picornavirus. IRF3 is targeted for polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation by the N-terminal proteases of bovine viral diarrhea virus and classical swine fever virus [196], [197], pestiviruses of the family Flaviviridae, and by the NSP1 of rotavirus, a dsRNA virus in the family Reoviridae [198]. IRF7 is hydrolyzed by EV71 3C protease [199]. This transcription factor is also known to be degraded via the ubiquitin-protease pathway by the KSHV RTA protein, which in this case acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase [200].",

Two viral encoded vaccinia virus proteins that play key roles in disrupting signaling from multiple TLRs are A46R and A52R. A46R contains a TIR domain, which enables this viral protein to associate with four of the five known TLR adaptor proteins, MyD88, TRIF, TRAM, and MAL, inhibiting the assembly of signaling complexes containing these adaptor molecules [201]. A52R, however, interacts with TRAF6 and IRAK2 and disrupts their incorporation into signaling complexes [202]. SARS coronavirus M protein physically associates with TRAF3, TBK1, and IKK\u03b5, thereby impeding the formation of TRAF3\u2013TANK\u2013TBK1\u2013IKK\u03b5 complex that is required for dsRNA-induced IRF3 phosphorylation and transcription from IFN-\u03b2 and ISRE promoters [203].

Vaccinia virus protein A49 is a virulence factor that antagonizes type I IFN induction via TLR3/TLR4/TLR9 and RIG-I pathways by abolishing NF-\u03baB activation. Mechanistically, A49 possesses an I\u03baB\u03b1-like motif, through which it binds to and prevents the action of \u03b2-TrCP, an E3 ligase that targets phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1 for ubiquitination and degradation [207]. Measles virus V protein associates with and acts as a decoy substrate for IKK\u03b1, competing IRF7 for phosphorylation by this kinase. This effectively limits IFN induction in pDCs following engagement of TLR7/TLR9 [208]. The V proteins from mumps virus and human parainfluenza virus type 2 and type 5 mimic IRF3 and act as alternative substrates for the IRF3 kinases, TBK1 and IKK\u03b5, thereby inhibiting IRF3 phosphorylation and activation downstream of TLR3 and RLR signaling [209].

Understanding TLR functions and their ligand recognition mechanisms has generated an intense interest in applying the knowledge to therapeutic applications. As such, much effort is being devoted to the development of TLR agonists for treating viral infections or as vaccine adjuvants.

Thus, derivatives of poly I:C were produced to lessen the toxicity of poly I:C given at high doses [223]. These include Ampligen [poly I:poly C (12)U; Hemispherx Biopharma] and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid stabilized with poly-l-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose (poly-ICLC; Hiltonol) [224]. Currently, Ampligen is in development for treatment of HIV infection, influenza, hepatitis B and C infection, and chronic fatigue syndrome [214].",

This necessitates the development of therapeutics that mimics TLR antagonists in alleviating certain virally induced diseases. This concept was supported by a recent study conducted by Shirey et al., in which the authors showed that therapeutic applications of a TLR4 antagonist, Eritora, were able to block influenza virus-induced lethality in mice, which correlated with an inhibition on virus-induced lung pathology and pulmonary inflammatory cytokine expression [231].",

            "text": "In response to invading pathogens such as viruses, a powerful antiviral innate immune system is rapidly activated in the host. TLRs are important constituents of this system and recognize a wide variety of PAMPs that are conserved molecular signatures of bacteria and viruses. Of the TLRs that have been identified, six represent a subclass that recognizes viral ligands. TLRs are predominately expressed in immune cells but also found in a variety of cell types. TLR3, TLR7/TLR8, and TLR9 are intracellular receptors located in endosomal compartments in which they detect viral dsRNA, ssRNA, and unmethylated CpG DNA, respectively. TLR2 and TLR4 reside on the cell surface and are stimulated by viral glycoproteins and, in some cases, nonstructural proteins released to extracellular milieu. The signaling mechanisms leading to the induction of antiviral innate immune responses are dependent on the particular TLR activated, its stimulus, and cell type. Through MyD88-dependent and/or TRIF-dependent pathways, TLRs elicit the production of proinflammatory cytokines and/or type I and type III IFNs via activation of the essential transcription factors NF-\u03baB and IRF family members, tailoring the innate immune responses and shaping the subsequent, antigen-specific adaptive immunity. These immune responses often contribute to viral clearance and disease resolution but sometimes can be harmful to the host. In the past decade and a half, much has been learned concerning TLR structures, ligand recognition, signaling mechanisms, and viral countermeasures of TLR signaling, but our knowledge of the precise roles TLRs play in antiviral immunity and viral disease pathogenesis in vivo falls short. Clearly, progresses in these areas using animal infection models that recapitulate viral diseases in humans are urgently needed and will unequivocally help develop novel therapeutic and preventive approaches against viral infections.",

TLR2 and TLR4 are present on the cell surface and recognize viral proteins. TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are intracellular viral nucleic-acid-sensing TLRs that are localized in endosomes. Viral dsRNA, ssRNA, and unmethylated CpG DNA are recognized by TLR3, TLR7/TLR8, and TLR9, respectively. Upon ligand recognition, TLR2 along with TLR6 or TLR1 and TLR4 recruits an additional adaptor protein, MAL, to link the TIR domain to MyD88. All TLRs except TLR3 recruit MyD88. TLR4 also recruits the adapter protein TRIF, as does TLR3. To activate the TRIF-dependent pathway, TLR4 requires the bridging adaptor TRAM and its trafficking into endosomes. The MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent signaling complexes through a cascade of signaling events leading to the activation of several transcription factors including NF-\u03baB, IRF3, and IRF7. NF-\u03baB transcriptionally regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines while IRF3 and IRF7 control the transcription of type I and type III IFN genes. Whereas TLR2 signaling only results in NF-\u03baB activation in most cell types, TLR2 can traffic to endosomes in inflammatory monocytes upon engagement of specific viral ligands such as vaccinia virus or MCMV where it results in IRF3/IRF7 activation and type I IFN induction (not depicted).",
