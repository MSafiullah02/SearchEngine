Most children (58.7%) did not have complications. 32.0%, 6.7%, and 2.7% of patients had one, two, and three complications, respectively. The most common complication was an increase of creatine kinase-MB [6]. There was only one case with severe pneumonia and one with critical illness. Most of the children (68.0%) have mild pneumonia, and the remaining children have acute upper respiratory infection (20.0%) or asymptomatic infection (9.3%). There were 42 patients co-infected with other pathogens, including mycoplasma pneumoniae (28 cases), bacteria (3 cases, including moraxella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae), influenza B virus (3 cases), influenza A virus (1 case), adenoviridae (2 cases), cytomegalovirus (1 case) and respiratory syncytial virus (1 case).

Young children are more dependent on their family members and infants are not suitable for wearing masks, which may explain why children younger than 2 years are the most vulnerable group to COVID-19. The age distribution in our center was consistent with previous studies [7,8]. Overall, the severity of COVID-19 in pediatric cases was milder than adults. Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has analyzed the illness severity of 44415 adult and pediatric patients, and found that severe and critical cases accounted for nearly 20% [9]. A epidemiological study in Chinese children with COVID-19 (n = 2143) showed that severe and critical illness accounted for 5.8% [10,11]. In this study only 2.7% of children were severe or critical cases. However, the severity of the disease may be underestimated because our data were calculated based on discharged patients rather than all confirmed cases, and mild cases were more likely to be discharged. The major clinical symptoms of children were similar to those of adults, such as fever and cough. But the typical symptoms (e.g. fatigue and sputum) of children were less frequent than that of adults [6]. In addition, the features of chest CT for pediatric patients were also different from adults, which has been specifically discussed by our colleagues [11].",

In our center and another three hospitals in Zhejiang Province, China, all children were given interferon-\u03b1 by aerosolisation [9]. Consequently, the efficacy of interferon remains to be evaluated. In fact, interferon was commonly used in combination with ribavirin rather than alone in the treatment of SARS or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [14]. However, the efficacy of this combination in patients was still controversial [14,15]. In our center, we have combined interferon with ribavirin for severe and critically ill patients. In the study of Qiu et al., none of the patients received ribavirin, whereas, 39% of the patients used lopinavir-ritonavir (LPV/r) [9]. Regardless of the illness severity and other baseline characteristics, the days of hospital stay (14 \u00b1 3 vs. 10.57 \u00b1 3.22 days) and SARS-CoV-2 clearance (10 \u00b1 2 vs. 6.39 \u00b1 2.29 days) in their centers were not shorter than ours. Yet the efficacy needs to be confirmed by multi-center and large-sample research.",

Zhu et al. compared the efficacy of arbidol monotherapy with LPV/r, and found that patients in the arbidol group had a shorter duration of positive RNA test (P < 0.01) [17]. On February 19, arbidol was included in National recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of respiratory infections caused by 2019-nCoV (the 6th edition). Then we started using arbidol. So far, only 5 discharged patients have been treated with arbidol, and all of them were mild cases, so the efficacy of this drug remained to be evaluated with a larger sample.",
