The outbreak rapidly became an epidemic across China over January. Consequently, COVID-19 was urgently classified as a Class B communicable disease and was managed as a Class A communicable disease in accordance with the Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Disease\n[3]. Various mitigation measures led to effective containment of the virus in early February, significant declines in infection in late February, and nationwide control by mid-March.",

On January 23, Wuhan implemented traffic restrictions; immediately after, a first-level response to a major public health emergency was launched, which is the highest level of emergency response to a public health crisis in China, according to the scope and degree of its impact. Urban bus, subway, ferry, and long-distance passenger transportation in Wuhan were all suspended, and departure channels in airport and railway stations were also temporarily closed down [6]. Consequently, during January 23\u201331, population outflow from Wuhan declined to 6% of that in the same period in 2019, and travel intensity within Wuhan declined to 23% of that in the same period in 2019 [7]. In addition, Wuhan initiated a universal symptom survey during February 6\u201310, followed by a second round during February 17\u201319.",

Implementation of universal symptom surveys (February 6\u201310 and 17\u201319) and clinical diagnostic criteria (February 12\u201314) was accompanied by the isolation of cases, and would therefore be expected to alter transmission.

In early February, a large number of suspected cases emerged in Wuhan, which was beyond the capacity for nucleic acid testing. Before the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria, individuals with typical COVID-19 clinical symptoms but without the nucleic acid test, or with negative nucleic acid test results, were unable to be diagnosed and isolated in time to prevent potential transmission.

Indeed, 5\u20137 d later, by February 19, the number of daily new cases and effective reproduction decreased dramatically. A second round of universal symptom survey over February 17\u201319 further consolidated the effects of the mitigation efforts. Collectively, the implementation of clinical diagnosis and universal symptom surveys in Wuhan in early-to-mid-February reduced the number of infections by nearly 20 000 and advanced two months of critical time points. It is notable that the actual data after February 19 deviated slightly from the epidemic pattern of infectious diseases as fitted by Model II, suggesting that some unconfirmed cases may exist.",

Second, asymptomatic infections and clinical classifications of the infections were not considered in this study. Third, a better estimation for the COVID-19 epidemic trend should rely on the data of the onset information of the infections, which was not publicly accessible. Fourth, potential confounders, such as further improvement of the reporting system and nucleic acid testing facility and capacity, were non-negligible during the causal inference based on observational data. In general, a set of measures, such as improvements of the reporting system and nucleic acid testing facility and capacity, aimed to increase the efficiency and sensitivity of identifying cases; these measures, if further improved after February 14, should have contributed to an increase in the number of daily new cases after February 14, which was not in line with the facts.
