Although HMPV infection is regarded as generally mild and self-limiting in adults, it is gaining increased attention as the cause of severe pneumonia [[2], [3], [4]]. However, few investigators have addressed the outcomes of adults with severe HMPV-associated community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission [5,6]. Outcome analyses of prior ICU studies have been limited by its retrospective design, relatively small number of patients, lack of adequate control groups, and heterogeneous study populations.",

All patients aged \u226516 years admitted to the medical ICU with severe CAP from March 2010 to August 2017 were included. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Asan Medical Center. Using a standardized protocol, investigators prospectively collected detailed data on demographics, comorbidities, medications, clinical and laboratory findings, the severity of illness score, management, and outcome information. The microbiological evaluation was performed as described previously [7,8]: respiratory viruses were identified from nasopharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates, and bronchoscopic lavage (BAL) fluids, and the microorganisms identified from specimens collected \u2264 72 h after hospital admission were considered CAP pathogens. The main outcome was all-cause 60-day mortality. The characteristics and outcomes of severe HMPV-associated CAP patients were compared with those of severe IFV-associated CAP patients. Subgroup analyses were performed according to the presence or absence of immunocompromised condition [9]. Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test or Fisher\u2019s exact test, and continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. p values of <0.05 were considered significant. All analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows version 23.0 (IBM SPSS, Armonk, New York).",

The presence of end-stage renal disease (n = 8) or chronic renal failure (n = 5) may prohibit the use of ribavirin [10]. Furthermore, there has been no proven effective therapy for HMPV pneumonia. Oral ribavirin alone or in combination with IVIG was not beneficial for HMPV patients in our study. The similar mortality rates between the two groups, despite a lack of effective antiviral therapy in HMPV patients, indicate that the virulence potential of HMPV might be lower than that of IFV.

Recently, Hwang et al. retrospectively analyzed the risks of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and mortality following HMPV infection in hospitalized adults [6]. The in-hospital mortality rate among 22 ARDS patients was 36.4%, which is similar to that noted in our study. They included some immunocompromised patients and cases of hospital-acquired infection. Because the mortality rates of those patients were not analyzed separately, it was difficult to directly compare these mortality rates with our results. Another study included 40 HMPV-positive patients admitted to the ICU [5]. The overall mortality was 18.0%. The proportion of patients who required mechanical ventilation (55.0%) was lower than that in our study (90.0%). None of these prior studies included control groups for comparison. Because the characteristics and outcomes of IFV-associated pneumonia have been well-documented, we compared the outcomes between severe HMPV-associated CAP and IFV-associated CAP patients. We combined the IFV-A and IFV-B subgroups and used it as control group in our analysis. The outcomes of the IFV-A and IFV-B subgroups may be different. We provided outcome data for each group in Table 2. When we compared the outcomes between the IFV-A and IFV-B groups, the differences were not significant (data not shown). However, considering the small number of IFV-B cases, this issue should be investigated in further studies.",

Second, we did not have an adequate number of fatal outcomes for multivariable analyses in HMPV patients. Third, we included co-infection cases in both groups, and these cases were more common in the influenza group. Co-infections may have affected the outcomes and bias comparisons between the groups [11]. Fourth, our cases may have included cases of incidental upper respiratory tract infection or colonization [12]. Finally, HMPV genotypic information and viral load, which may affect the disease outcome, were not available in our study.",
