This article was the section of thoracic CT findings. Data were collected from all the consecutive patients admitted to the infectious diseases and tropical medicine department in Al-Zahra Hospital in Isfahan, central Iran, from September 23rd in 2009 to February 20th in 2010 who fulfilled the criteria for confirmation of H1N1influenza infection, as established by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.3910 These criteria include flu-like symptoms such as a body temperature of 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F) or higher, cough or sore throat, and a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasal swabs or aspirates with positive results for 2009 H1N1 virus. The clinical diagnosis of suspected or probable cases had been made by trained residents or attending physicians of the infectious diseases center. For confirmation, nasopharyngeal samples had been sent to the National Influenza Reference Laboratory at Tehran School of Public Health in a viral transport medium (virocult, Medical wire & Equipment, UK) and had been tested with the real time RT-PCR protocol and reagents supplied by the WHO. The patients did not have computerized medical records about confirmation of H1N1influenza infection, and such data were collected from Public Health Department. Out of 216 patients with confirmed 2009 H1N1 virus infection, 111 patients had chest radiographs, and 40 patients had thoracic CT scan with intravenous (IV) contrast on admission time or during the hospitalization, depending upon the clinical judgment of the clinicians. Sixteen patients had normal thoracic CT. Twenty-six patients with abnormal thoracic CT findings were enrolled in the study. The findings which were compatible with acute infective process (primary viral, secondary bacterial or mixed pneumonia) were then described according to the pattern of the opacity. CT scans were assessed for the presence of ground-glass opacities, consolidation, airbronchogram, diffuse alveolar opacities, patchy infiltrations, interstitial infiltrations, and cavity and tree-in-bud pattern. The presence of pleural, subpleural, or peribronchial/central abnormalities as well as adenopathy was also",
