            "text": "The work of Kermack and McKendick  [1] was the fundamental study of epidemic models described by nonlinear differential equations. In this field, epidemic models have recently attracted much attention of mathematical epidemiologists and are perceived as significant  [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. Wang, Takeuchi and Liu  [8] studied a multi-group SVEIR epidemic model with distributed delay and vaccination. Sun and Shi  [9] considered a multigroup SEIR model with nonlinear incidence of infection and nonlinear removal functions between compartments. To understand the effect of transport-related infection on disease spread, Cui, Takeuchi and Saito  [10] proposed the spreading disease with transport-related infection. Takeuchi, Liu and Cui  [11] investigated the global dynamics of SIS models with transport-related infection, their conclusions implied that transport-related infection on disease can make the disease endemic even if all the isolated regions are disease free. Yan and Zou  [12] considered two control variables representing the quarantine and isolation strategies for SARS epidemics, they gave a theoretical interpretation to the practical experiences that the early quarantine and isolation strategies are critically important to control the outbreaks of epidemic. Chowell and Castillo-Chavez  [13] used the uncertainly and sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive number R0 to assess the role that the model parameters play in outbreak control. Quarantine and isolation measures have been widely used to control the spread of diseases such as yellow fever, smallpox, measles, ebola, pandemic influenza, diphtheria, plague, cholera, and, more recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)  [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. Xie, et al.  [20] simultaneously use two kinds of measures: expand the treatment ranges of suspected case and limit population flows freely to suppress the diffusion of SARS effectively. Gong et al.  [21] showed that the SARS may fluctuate with import of SARS infectiousness from outside Beijing, weakness of quarantine, more social activities and so on.",

The pulse vaccination strategy (PVS) consists of repeated application of vaccine at discrete time with equal interval in a population in contrast to the traditional constant vaccination  [22], [23]. At each vaccination time a constant fraction of the susceptible population is vaccinated successfully. Since 1993, attempts have been made to develop mathematical theory to control infectious diseases using pulse vaccination  [22]. Compared to the proportional vaccination models, the study of pulse vaccination models is in its infancy  [23]. The control of childhood viral infections by pulse vaccination strategy is discussed by Nokes and Swinton  [24], [25]. Stone et al.  [26] presented a theoretical examination of the pulse vaccination strategy in the SIR epidemic model. d\u2019Onofrio  [27] investigated the application of the pulse vaccination policy to eradicate infectious disease for SIR and SEIR epidemic models.",

The theories of population dynamical system and its application have been achieved many good results. However, the oasis vegetation degradation combining with dynamical system has been considered very little. In this paper, we will investigate an impulsive dispersal on SIR model with restricting infected individuals boarding transports. We expect to obtain some dynamical properties of the investigated system. We also expect that impulsive dispersal will provides reliable tactic for controlling epidemic.",

There is no need to calculate the exact form of \u2217i(i=1,2), as they are not required in the analysis that follows. The linearization of the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth equations of (2.2) is (S11(n\u03c4+)I1(n\u03c4+)S12(n\u03c4+)I2(n\u03c4+))=(1\u2212D0D00100D01\u2212D00001)(S11(n\u03c4)I1(n\u03c4)S12(n\u03c4)I2(n\u03c4)). The linearization of the ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth equations of (2.2) is (S11(n\u03c4+)I1(n\u03c4+)S12(n\u03c4+)I2(n\u03c4+))=(1\u2212\u03bc10000100001\u2212\u03bc200001)(S11(n\u03c4)I1(n\u03c4)S12(n\u03c4)I2(n\u03c4)). The stability of the periodic solution (S1(t)\u02dc,0,S2(t)\u02dc,0) is determined by the eigenvalues of M=(1\u2212D0D00100D01\u2212D00001)(1\u2212\u03bc10000100001\u2212\u03bc200001)\u03a6(\u03c4), where are \u03bb1=(1\u2212\u03bc1)(1\u2212D)e\u2212d1\u03c4<1, and \u03bb2=|(1\u2212D)(K1+K3)+(1\u2212D)2(K1+K3)2\u22124(1\u22122D)K1K32|\u2264|(1\u2212D)(K1+K3)+(1+D)2(K1+K3)22|\u2264|(K1+K3)2|, and \u03bb3=(1\u2212\u03bc2)(1\u2212D)e\u2212d2\u03c4<1, and \u03bb4=|(1\u2212D)(K1+K3)\u2212(1\u2212D)2(K1+K3)2\u22124(1\u22122D)K1K32|\u2264|(1\u2212D)(K1+K3)\u2212(1\u2212D)2(K1\u2212K3)22|=|(1\u2212D)(K1+K3)\u2212(1\u2212D)2(K1\u2212K3)22|\u2264(1\u2212D)max{K1,K3}, where K1=e\u222b0\u03c4[\u03b21S1(t)\u02dc\u2212(r1+d1+b1)]dt and K3=e\u222b0\u03c4[\u03b22S2(t)\u02dc\u2212(r2+d2+b2)]dt. According to condition (4.1), (4.2) and the Floquet theory  [39], i.e.  exp[\u222b0\u03c4(\u03b2iSi(t)\u02dc\u2212(ri+di+bi))dt]<1(i=1,2), then, \u03bb2\u2264|(K1+K3)2|<1, and \u03bb4\u2264(1\u2212D)max{K1,K3}<1, hold, the infection-free boundary periodic solution (S1(t)\u02dc,0,S2(t)\u02dc,0) of (2.2) is locally stable.In the following, we will prove the global attraction. Choose a \u03b5>0 such that \u03c1i=exp[\u222b0\u03c4(\u03b2i(Si(t)\u02dc+\u03b5)\u2212(ri+di+bi))dt]<1(i=1,2). From the first and third equations of (2.2), we notice that dSi(t)dt\u2264\u03bbi\u2212diSi(t)(i=1,2). Then, we consider following impulsive comparative differential equation (4.3){dS21(t)dt=\u03bb1\u2212d1S21(t),dS22(t)dt=\u03bb2\u2212d2S22(t),}t\u2260(n+l)\u03c4,t\u2260(n+1)\u03c4,\u25b3S21(t)=D(S22(t)\u2212S21(t)),\u25b3S22(t)=D(S21(t)\u2212S22(t)),}t=(n+l)\u03c4,\u25b3S21(t)=\u2212\u03bc1S21(t),\u25b3S22(t)=\u2212\u03bc2S22(t),}t=(n+1)\u03c4. From Lemma 3.6 and comparison theorem of impulsive equation (see theorem 3.1.1 in Ref.  [39]), we have S1(t)\u2264S21(t), S2(t)\u2264S22(t) and S21(t)\u2192S1(t)\u02dc, S22(t)\u2192S2(t)\u02dc, as t\u2192\u221e. Then (4.4){S1(t)\u2264S21(t)\u2264S1(t)\u02dc+\u03b5,S2(t)\u2264S22(t)\u2264S2(t)\u02dc+\u03b5, for all t large enough. For convenience, we may assume (4.4) holds for all t\u22650. From (2.2) and (4.4), we get (4.5)dIi(t)dt\u2264[\u03b2i(Si(t)\u02dc+\u03b5)\u2212(ri+di+bi)]Ii(t)(i=1,2). So Ii((n+1)\u03c4)\u2264Ii(n\u03c4+)exp[\u222bn\u03c4(n+1)\u03c4(\u03b2i(Si(S)\u02dc+\u03b5)\u2212(ri+di+bi))ds](i=1,2). Hence Ii(n\u03c4)\u2264Ii(0+)\u03c1in(i=1,2) and Ii(n\u03c4)\u21920(i=1,2) as n\u2192\u221e, therefore Ii(t)\u21920(i=1,2) as t\u2192\u221e.Next, we will prove that Si(t)\u2192Si(t)\u02dc(i=1,2) as t\u2192\u221e. For \u03b51>0, there must exist a t0>0 such that 0<Ii(t)<\u03b51(i=1,2) for all t\u2265t0. Without loss of generality, we may assume that 0<Ii(t)<\u03b51 for all t\u22650. For system (2.2) we have (4.6)\u03bbi\u2212(di+\u03b2i\u03b511+\u03b1i\u03b51)Si(t)\u2264dSi(t)dt\u2264\u03bbi\u2212dixi(t)(i=1,2), then we have S31(t)\u2264S1(t)\u2264S21(t), S32(t)\u2264S2(t)\u2264S22(t) and S31(t)\u2192S31(t)\u02dc,S32(t)\u2192S32(t)\u02dc, S21(t)\u2192S1(t)\u02dc,S22(t)\u2192S2(t)\u02dc as t\u2192\u221e.
