            "text": "The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), is a highly infectious RNA virus. A still-debated percentage of patients develop coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after infection, whose symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath and fatigue. Acute and life-threatening respiratory symptoms are experienced by 10-20% of symptomatic patients, particularly those with underlying medical conditions that includes diabetes, COPD and pregnancy. One of the main challenges in the containment of COVID-19 is the identification and isolation of asymptomatic/presymptomatic individuals. As communities re-open, large numbers of people will need to be tested and contact-tracing of positive patients will be required to prevent additional waves of infections and enable the continuous monitoring of the viral loads COVID-19 positive patients. A number of molecular assays are currently in clinical use to detect SARS-CoV-2. Many of them can accurately test hundreds or even thousands of patients every day. However, there are presently no testing platforms that enable more than 10,000 tests per day. Here, we describe the foundation for the REcombinase Mediated BaRcoding and AmplificatioN Diagnostic Tool (REMBRANDT), a high-throughput Next Generation Sequencing-based approach for the simultaneous screening of over 100,000 samples per day. The REMBRANDT protocol includes direct two-barcoded amplification of SARS-CoV-2 and control amplicons using an isothermal reaction, and the downstream library preparation for Illumina sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. This protocol represents a potentially powerful approach for community screening, a major bottleneck for testing samples from a large patient population for COVID-19.",

At present, the efficacy of seroconversion tests is still to be determined. Moreover, seroconversion following a SARS-CoV-2 infection displays an as yet unknown protective immunity (3) . Thus, detection of the viral RNA genome remains the best predictor of both early infection, pre-or asymptomatic stages as well as an indicator of viral clearance and reduced or eliminated viral transmissibility.

This protocol contains a number of key advances that maximize output and sensitivity whilst retaining speed and efficiency. Specifically, REMBRANDT uses recombination and repair enzymes to detect and amplify the viral genomic RNA (4) . The amplification simultaneously tags the individual samples with dual barcoded primers ( Figure 2 ). This critical step rapidly generates DNA products that are significantly more stable than RNA. Utilizing two independent barcoded primers per well enables a single patient sample within a 96-well plate to be independently marked with a well-specific barcode and a plate-specific barcode. This algorithm reduces the number of barcodes 100-fold from conventional barcoding methods. Once barcoded, the patient samples from multiple 96-well plates can be pooled and purified, ultimately minimizing reagent usage, time and sample-to-sample variation. While the system is further scalable, we provide barcoded primers sufficient to distinguish individual samples for ninety six 96-well plates or 9,216 patient samples. Processing these samples together enables rapid library construction using any one of the barcoded Illumina kits. Utilizing 12 Illumina barcodes allows further sample multiplexing such that twelve different 9,216 combined samples may be further mixed together to perform Next Generation (NextGen) Sequencing analysis of 110,592 patient samples in a single run on a number of Illumina-based platforms. The smaller numbers of barcodes requires less timeconsuming computational processing, as trimmed sequences can be quickly divided based on barcode, and mapped to SARS-CoV-2 N gene or a control human gene (RNAse P) sequences.",

The REMBRANDT pipeline also offers flexibility and can be readily adapted to detect other viral genes, viruses and/or other pathogenic species, by switching the design of the amplification primers. The protocol described here provides experimental evidence that the designed RT-RPA is effective in amplifying the synthetic SARS-CoV-2 N-gene RNA.

Protocol: In vitro RNA transcription: to generate positive control RNAs, T7-flanked forward primers and standard reverse primers (Supplementary Information) were used in a PCR reaction to apply a region of each target gene with Q5 polymerase. Templates used in this work were COVID-19-N (10006625, IDT) and RNPase P (10006626, IDT). Gel purified PCR products (200ng) are purified and used in T7 (Roche 10881775001) in vitro transcription reaction. DNase is then added for 15mins, before the RNA is precipitated using standard ethanol RNA purification method (8). Plate Preparation (PP): PP1: Chemically synthesize ninety six forward barcoding primers (plate-specific barcode) and ninety six reverse barcoding primers (well-specific barcode) (see sequences in Supplementary Information), dissolved at a 10 \u00b5M concentration in RNase-free water. A total of 2.8 ml of each primer is required for the full protocol (includes 20% extra volume due to pipetting error).",

Place the column(s) on a vacuum manifold, turn on the vacuum source and let the sample clear from the column (repeat this step up to 5 times). Add 5 ml of DNA wash Buffer.Repeat the wash step. Leave the vacuum source on for additional 5 minutes to remove all the wash buffer. Transfer the column into a 50 ml conical tube. Add 2 ml of water to the column and wait 1 minute. Centrifuge at 3,000 x g for 3 minutes and collect the eluted barcoded DNA.RS10:If performing multiple plates/columns, combine the eluted barcoded DNA and label the combination as \"Batch 1\" RS11: Repeat steps RS1-10. Ideally the procedure can be repeated a total of 24 times. The subsequent 1-24 Batches are individually used for library preparation, and SHOULD NOT be combined until AFTER LIGATION (Library construction) with batch specific adapters.Library construction (LC):LC1: Before library construction, a fraction of each purified pool of barcoded products should be examined using the Bioanalyzer to determine concentration and product size. The respective size of the COVID-19 and RNase P product are 124 and 104 bp, respectively. LC2: Using the Illumina library construction kit (e7490), start at protocol 1.6 and conduct End repair on each pool of DNA fragments.LC3: Proceed to Adaptor LigationStep LC4: Proceed to Purification of Ligation of Reaction step. This is critical to remove any free adaptor that will add noise to the library construction.LC5: PCR Enrichment of Ligation Reaction. We recommend using 8 cycles to minimize overamplification.LC6: Purification of PCR reaction.LC7:The overall library quality should be checked using a Bioanalyzer to confirm the size of the DNA fragments. Libraries that contain detectable levels of Primer-Primer annealing events should be repeated.LC8: Determine the absolute DNA concentration of each library using Qubit.

Each of the forward primers contained an extended region that coded for the T7 polymerase binding site. This site was then used to synthesize each RNA using T7 polymerase transcription that was then purified using ethanol precipitation. We then utilized different dilutions of the RNase P RNA to identify specific conditions for the accurate and reproducible amplification of this region using a combined Reverse Transcriptase-Recombinase-Polymerase Amplification (RT-RPA) (",

            "text": "In brief, we have developed a computational framework that separates samples based on 3 sets of barcodes using a nested iteration from the ShortRead Bioconductor package (9). The RNA-Seq fastq files are first imported into the R environment using the FastqStreamer() function and the sequence information extracted using the yield() function in FastqStreamer. For each read iteration, we use the grepl() string searching function to identify input barcodes. If input barcodes are identified, the reads are placed in a new fastq file using the writeFastq() function. The new fastq files are the input files for the next round of iterations of inputting, string-searching, and splitting files using the next round of barcodes.These process iterations start by de-multiplexing based on Illumina barcodes followed by platespecific barcodes followed by well-specific barcodes. This iterative approach can efficiently map reads in to each unique barcode combination. Once complete, all of the reads are mapped to the inputted control RNase P, SARS-CoV-2 N gene and control SARS-CoV-2 oligo using the Rsubread Bioconductor package(10).
