The disease is characterized by the destruction of dividing lymphoid cells in the bursa of Fabricius leading to immunosuppression in addition to losses due to impaired growth, death, and excessive condemnation of carcasses due to skeletal muscle hemorrhages (Eterradossi and Saif 2013) . Like most viral diseases of poultry, treatment is not available and vaccination is the principal method of prevention (Muller et al. 2012 ). However, vaccination against IBDV is problematic. Inactivated and subunit vaccines result in different levels of maternally derived antibodies (MDA) in the offspring and compartmentalize the flock into individuals with low and high susceptibility to virulent IBDV. Live attenuated vaccines entail the risk of being neutralized by the MDA. Moreover, due to poor efficiency, such vaccines need to be applied at least twice, which is a labor-intensive and costly exercise. The use of more virulent live vaccines to overcome the latter problem itself causes immunosuppression and bursal damage (Arnold et al. 2012) .",

            "text": "The use of various immuno-potentiating agents is therefore recommended both for reducing the effects of IBD and for improving host responses to vaccination with live viruses. Withania somnifera (Linn.) Dunal, commonly known as Indian ginseng or Indian wintercherry, is an important herb and functional food in many indigenous systems of medicine including Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, Sowa Rigpa, and Chinese medicine. Popularly identified by its Sanskrit name Ashwagandha, it is regarded as the Queen of all Ayurvedic herbs, with its first use recorded approximately 5000 years ago (Tiwari et al. 2014) . Roots of the plant are classified as an adaptogen and reputed to promote health and longevity (Weiner and Weiner 1994) . The roots of the plant form a principal component of almost every herbal anti-stressor supplement for animals and humans in the subcontinent. Dietary supplementation with the Withania somnifera root powder (WSR) improves physiological functions in chicken suffering from heat stress, heavy metal toxicity, etc. Supplementation of broiler feed with WSR results in significant improvements in packed cell volume, hemoglobin percent, and hemagglutination inhibition titer against Newcastle disease virus, and better cellular response to dinitrochlorobenzene. WSR supplementation at 1% in feed significantly improves body weights, feed efficiency, and immune status of birds (Akotkar et al. 2007 ). Dietary supplementation of broilers with WSR at 0.1% in feed reverses cadmium-induced oxidative damage and restored hepatorenal functions and body weight; erythrocyte SOD and CAT activities are reduced, and GSH is increased besides reducing TBARS of the liver and renal tissues (Bharavi et al. 2010) . Similarly, the supplementation of crude extract of Withania somnifera in broilers causes an effective and dosedependent reversal of enrofloxacin-induced immunosuppression (Arivuchelvan et al. 2013) . Previous studies have confirmed that mono-and polyherbal preparations containing WSR improve host responses toward IBD and Newcastle disease vaccination. WSR also ameliorates viral chicken anemia in poultry (Tiwari et al. 2014) . We were the first to show the in vitro inhibition of IBDV by an extract of Withania somnifera roots (Ganguly et al. 2010) . Of late, a part of this inhibition has been attributed to its ability to induce nitric oxide production in the virus-infected host cells (Ganguly et al. 2018) . Here, we report the results of an exploratory study on the ameliorative effects of dietary supplementation with WSR on IBDV-infected chicken.",

Arivuchelvan et al. (2013) have reported that dietary supplementation with Withania somnifera crude extracts brought about a nearcomplete reversal of enrofloxacin-induced hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia, and hypoglobulinemia in broilers. In chicken, the mean reference value of total serum proteins is 56 g/L and the protein content of the plasma is about 1.5 g/L higher than this value due to the added presence of fibrinogen (Kaneko et al. 1997; Lumeij 1997) . Similarly, the mean reference values of albumin and globulin in the chicken are about 25 g/L and 31 g/L, respectively (Kaneko et al. 1997) . The finding in this study of an overall reduction in total protein and its subcomponents was consistent with previous works mentioned above. However, the A:G ratio appears to have remained conserved.",

On the fifth day post-infection, very severe fibroplasia that invaded the intra-follicular space was present in the bursa.

The virus-induced lymphonecrosis was milder with a more rapid reticular response in the bursae of birds of the WV group.

By the seventh day post-infection, a large difference in the bursal lesion score was seen between groups V and WV. The overall differences between groups were highly significant. Figure 3 shows the results of the determination of relative viral load in the bursae collected from the different groups on the seventh day post-infection on the basis of integrated densitometric values. The differences between control and WS groups were non-significant; all other differences were highly significant. Figure 4 shows the immunofluorescence in sections of bursae collected from groups V and WV on day 7 post-infection. Immunofluorescence is a standard test for Fig. 3 Relative semiquantification of viral load in bursae on the seventh day postinfection; IDV of RT-PCR product of 249-bp fragment of VP2 RNA was used for the relative semi-quantification of viral load; IDV of RT-PCR product of \u03b2actin transcript served as control demonstrating the presence of the virus in host tissue (Eterradossi and Saif 2013) . The bursal section from group V shows higher viral antigen concentrated mainly within the follicles; the follicular silhouette was apparent in the fluorescence pattern. The WV group showed lesser viral load that was diffusely present throughout the bursal section; however, few small, focal concentrations of viral antigen were still discernible.",

Birds of group WV also had significantly improved total protein, albumin, and globulin levels in plasma as compared with birds of group V. The birds of group V developed elevated plasma levels of glucose, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) post-infection. The level of these analytes was significantly better in group WV. Birds of group WV failed to show a significant improvement in bursal index, though gross and histological appearance of the bursae were qualitatively much better in this group than those from group V. Relative semiquantitation of the viral antigen in bursae revealed that group WV had less than one-fourth (24.78%) of the viral load in group V by day 7 post-infection. In the indirect immunofluorescent test, bursae from group WV again showed a qualitative reduction in viral antigen as compared with the bursae from group V. Birds of group V showed significantly lowered responsiveness of B and T lymphocytes to mitogens. Mitogenic responsiveness of lymphocytes was significantly better in the birds of group WV than in the birds of group V. The birds of group WV also showed non-significant improvements in several other parameters such as total body weight, Fig. 4 Immunofluorescent staining of sections of bursae collected on day 7 post-infection (\u00d7 100). a Bursal section from group V shows higher fluorescence, concentrated within follicles. b Bursal section from group WV shows lesser and diffuse fluorescence growth rate, feed conversion ratio, plasma cholesterol concentration, and macrophage function as compared with the birds of group V. The study concluded that continued dietary supplementation of layers with WS root powder at 1% of feed ameliorates IBDV-induced hematological, biochemical, and immunological alterations, resulting in lower viral persistence in the host, and also afforded protection against virus-induced stress a n d h i s t o p a t h o l o g i c a l c h a n g e s . T h u s , d i e t a r y supplementation of chicken with WS root powder holds promise for protecting the chicken from Infectious Bursal Disease, reducing morbidity in infected birds as well as for combating immunosuppression in birds immunized with a hot vaccine.
