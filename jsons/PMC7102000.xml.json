Common laboratory tests include functional coagulation tests for lupus anticoagulants (LAC) and immunological assays for antibodies against cardiolipin (aCL) and \u03b22-glycoprotein I (\u03b22GPI). This syndrome may be \u2018primary\u2019 or may be associated with other diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Retrospective studies suggest that patients with APS have an increased risk of recurrent thromboembolism [4, 5, 6], and for this reason it is recommended that they receive oral vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, in order to achieve an international normalized ratio (INR) range within a therapeutic level (INR\u21923). In most clinical situations, therapeutic doses are sufficient to control this disease and prevent further thromboembolism.",

During the course of treatment, brainstem reflexes remained constant. CT images that were prepared because of persistent headache showed a left parietal cyst formation, which subsequently dissolved. The oral anticoagulation was changed to warfarin. Clopidogrel was discontinued. During the course of further treatments the patient recovered almost completely.

These include warfarin withdrawal, inadequate warfarinization, and the administration of certain drugs, particularly oral contraceptives etc. Retrospective studies suggest that patients with APS have an increased risk of recurrent thromboembolism [4, 5, 6]. Patients with high positive aCL antibodies may have more frequent thrombo-occlusive events after cerebral ischemia [18]. It is therefore recommended that such patients receive oral vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, in order to achieve an international normalized ratio (INR) within the recommended therapeutic range. A beneficial role for anticoagulants in decreasing the rate of recurrent thrombosis has been shown in several retrospective studies [19, 20, 21]. Oral anticoagulation therapy with warfarin is monitored by the prothrombin time and the international normalized ratio (INR). In general, therapy with oral anticoagulants targeted at an INR of 2.5 is very effective as it reduces the risk of recurrent thromboembolism by 90\u201395% [22]. This approach also holds for patients with the hereditary thrombophilias [23]. In patients with lupus anticoagulants who have sustained a thromboembolic event the recommended INR for oral anticoagulation is controversial. It has been recommended by some that high-intensity anticoagulation with INRs of 3.0 or greater for patients with APS should be administered to prevent further thromboembolic complications [21].",

However, circulating antibodies have been described which may interfere with correct measurement of the INR [40]. In patients with APS also, a prolonged prothrombin time may be found as a result of an antibody-mediated decrease in factor II levels [41]. Even closely monitored anticoagulation using intravenous heparin in an ICU setting was unable to prevent ongoing embolism, and the patient suffered from arterial embolism to her right foot while being treated with i.v. heparin with a controlled thrombin time of 60 s (normal range <20 s).",
