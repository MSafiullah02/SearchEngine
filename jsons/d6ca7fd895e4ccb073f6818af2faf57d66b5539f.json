Feline histoplasmosis is considered one of the more common deep mycotic infections in cats and several case reports/ series have been published from endemic areas (Clinkenbeard and others 1987 , Davis & Troy 1996 , Br\u00f6mel & Sykes 2005 .

Six weeks later the owner reported that the cat was still lethargic and anorexic and that it was diffi cult to administer treatment. Ultrasound examination revealed that the lesions of the small bowel and the size of the abdominal mass were unchanged, while the amount of free fl uid had increased. Debulking of the mass was proposed, but the owner refused. Cytology of the peritoneal fl uid revealed the presence of numerous infected macrophages.

In our case, lung lesions were visible only at necropsy. The most important clinical signs in the case reported here were gastrointestinal, including vomiting and anorexia. Intestinal involvement was severe in our case and subsequent necrosis and perforation of the intestine undoubtedly lead to the worsening of the cat's condition and the poor response to treatment.

Abnormal fi ndings were poor body condition, pale mucous membranes, dehydration and a palpable abdominal mass.Abdominal ultrasound showed lymph node enlargement, a mass of uncertain origin, thickening of the muscularis layer of the small bowel, focal thickening of the ileum with loss of layering and free peritoneal fl uid. Cytology revealed a piogranulomatous infi ltrate and numerous macrophages containing oval or round yeast-like cells 2 to 5 \u00b5m diameter with a central, spherical, lightly basophilic body surrounded by a clear halo, compatible with Histoplasma capsulatum, within the cytoplasm. Post-mortem examination revealed cavity effusions, granulomatous nodules in lungs, intestine and omentum, thickened intestinal walls and intestinal perforation. Staining with Grocott and immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed numerous organisms within the granulomatous reaction. H. capsulatum has a worldwide distribution in temperate and subtropical climates. To the author's knowledge, this is the fi rst report of feline histoplasmosis in Europe.",
