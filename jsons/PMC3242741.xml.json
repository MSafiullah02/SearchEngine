Virus stocks were purified by adsorption to and elution from turkey red blood cells and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use as previously described [25]. The determination of virus titer was performed by titrating virus in MDCK cells, with daily observation of cytopathic effect and confirmation by hemagglutination assay. The tissue culture infective dose affecting 50% of the cultures (TCID50) was calculated by the Reed-Muench formula. Ultraviolet (UV)\u2013irradiated virus was prepared by irradiation with energy of 0.2 J in a UV crosslinker as described previously [26].",

Bound antibody was detected by using horseradish peroxidase\u2013conjugated streptavidin and tetramethybenzidine substrate solution (R&D Systems). The binding of MBL to influenza virus was evaluated by the absolute absorbance values measured at 450 nm (A450).",

Lung inflammatory changes were graded using a semiquantitative scoring system based on the following parameters: peribronchiolar and bronchial infiltrates, bronchiolar and bronchial luminal exudates, perivascular infiltrates, parenchymal pneumonia, and edema, as previously described [28]. Each parameter was graded on a scale of 0\u20134 with 0 as absent, 1 as slight, 2 as mild, 3 as moderate, and 4 as severe.

            "text": "We demonstrated that despite these 2 strains of viruses being bound by rhMBL via the CRD of MBL at the physiological level, they infected both MBL WT and MBL KO mice effectively. Our results are consistent with a recent in vitro study by Job et al [18], in which MBL was found to bind to pdmH1N1 fairly in vitro but the virus was resistant to the antiviral activity of MBL. The number and position of potential glycosylation sites on the viral HA globular domain determine the binding affinity between MBL and the virus. Even though MBL can physically bind to the virus, the binding may be insufficient for executing any antiviral function. Arguably, Chang et al [23] recently reported that MBL deficiency increases susceptibility to infection with influenza A virus Philippine 82 H3N2 (Phil82), which is a human strain. We reconcile with the suggestion that MBL effects would differ depending on strains of influenza A virus and thus MBL causes variable antiviral activities and host responses. The degree of glycosylation on the globular head of the HA molecule is believed to be essential for MBL to exhibit its antiviral properties. For Phil82 virus, the high-mannose oligosaccharide at residue 165 of the HA molecule has already been shown to be crucial for the neutralization by MBL [31]. Although pdmH1N1 virus contains a single potential glycosylation site at the base of the HA globular head (Asn104), it lacks potential glycosylation sites on the globular head region of HA (Asn142, Asn144, Asn172, Asn177, and Asn179) [18]. To our knowledge, binding of MBL on H9N2/G1 virus is not well documented in the literature. Therefore, we analyzed the potential glycosylation sites on HA of H9N2/G1 virus based on an in silico approach as suggested by Job et al [18]. The HA sequence data was retrieved from GenBank (AAF00706.1) and we used NetNGlyc 1.0 server to predict the number of potential glycosylation sites. We found that there was no potential glycosylation sites near residue 165 of the HA molecule of H9N2/G1 virus. We speculate that as a result of the absence of potential glycosylation sites near the receptor-binding domain of the HA globular head of both pdmH1N1 virus and H9N2/G1 virus, MBL fails to interfere with the viral binding to target cells despite its ability to bind the virus. This can adequately explain the discrepancy between the present in vivo data and Chang\u2019s study [23].",

This suggests that MBL may contribute to the disease severity seen in the MBL WT mice. To elucidate the mechanisms, we investigated the immune response, such as production of cytokines and chemokines at various time points during the infection. Most cytokines and chemokines were detected with similar kinetics, with the peak on day 7 following influenza virus infection in both MBL WT and MBL KO mice. These data suggest that the most critical phase of influenza infection occurs around day 7 after infection, and this is consistent with the result showing the peak of body weight loss around day 7.",

            "text": "Interestingly, we found that MBL contributed to a more severe proinflammatory response by increasing the production of several proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3. Interleukin 1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are multifunctional proinflammatory cytokines produced readily by influenza-infected leukocytes. They are capable of inducing fever, anorexia, and weight loss [32]. Enhanced production of these cytokines can contribute to the acute lung immunopathology after influenza virus infection in mice [33] and induce gene expression of other cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 [34, 35]. Despite the abundance of IL-6 following the influenza virus infection, in vivo studies showed that it does not contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection because the mortality and morbidity observed in mice infected with H5N1 are comparable in both MBL WT and IL-6 deficient mice [36, 37]. Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 is readily produced by influenza virus\u2013infected leukocytes and can activate macrophages, stimulate dendritic cell maturation and neutrophils, further enhance the inflammatory response, and activate efficient antigen presentation system in the infected site [20, 38]. Excessive production of TNF-\u03b1 causes tissue injury, hemorrhagic shock, and death in mice [39, 40]. Interferon \u03b3 is also an important proinflammatory cytokine that has different functions, including the activation of macrophages, differentiation of Th1 from T cells, enhancement of antigen presentation, and expression of the chemokine gene [41, 42]. These proinflammatory cytokines are commonly found in the acute-phase response to influenza virus infection and may induce immunity but also cause damage to the host tissue [43]. These cytokines were also increased in our infected murine lung, with significantly higher levels in MBL WT mice than in MBL KO mice on day 7, coinciding with body weight loss and lung histological findings. Interleukin 10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was also significantly higher in MBL WT mice than in MBL KO mice on day 7. Interleukin 10 deficiency was reportedly protective in high-dose influenza virus infection [44], implying that increased IL-10 may be deleterious to the host. As a consequence of such an overwhelming \u201ccytokine storm\u201d [45, 46], the MBL WT mice were found to have a worse disease course than in the MBL KO mice, including greater body weight loss and more severe lung inflammation.",

Influenza virus\u2013infected macrophages produced large amounts of these chemokines in vitro [25, 47, 48]. Functionally, these chemokines are important mediators for immune cell activation and chemotactic factors, which recruit leukocytes to the infected sites [49]. This may help account for our histological observation that more inflammatory cell infiltration was observed in MBL WT mice than in MBL KO mice.",
