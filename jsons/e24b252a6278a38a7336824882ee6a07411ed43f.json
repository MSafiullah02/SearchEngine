Using Twitter data, we aim to (1) define and quantify the prevalence and evolution of facets of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US in a spatiotemporal context and (2) examine the most amplified tweets among social distancing facets. We analyzed a total of 259,529 unique tweets containing \"coronavirus\" from 115,485 unique users between January 23, 2020 and March 24, 2020 that were identified by the Twitter API as English and U.S.-based. Tweets containing specified keywords (determined a priori) were grouped into six social distancing facets: implementation, purpose, social disruption, adaptation, positive emotions, and negative emotions. Tweets about social disruptiveness were most retweeted, and implementation tweets were most favorited. Social distancing tweets became overall more prevalent in the U.",

Social distancing has been one of the primary mitigation strategies in the United States, which compels individuals to stay at home as much as possible and avoid close contact with others to reduce transmission and intensity of the pandemic [1] [2] [3] . The realization of social distancing and its intersection with many aspects of our social, educational, professional, and emotional lives is unprecedented in its degree of magnitude. Social distancing can be viewed as a multi-faceted public health measure, involving many stakeholders, practices, and consequences. Development and evaluation of a measure of communication on a public health intervention-here, social distancing-may be beneficial for public health and public policy officials [4] .",

These facets may change in our subsequent studies as COVID-19 events evolve. The facets of social distancing are: (1) purpose and justification of imposing this disruptive nation-wide behavioral measure. The purpose is to slow the spread of COVID-19 to levels manageable by healthcare systems. (2) Implementation of social distancing to not only avoid mass gatherings but also maintain a 6-feet distance amongst individuals. The advisories imposing this facet translated to closing non-essential businesses, restaurants, schools, and colleges. Twitter is a microblogging platform by which users (tweeters) socialize and tweet through the network. Users on Twitter can contribute original content through tweeting thoughts, opinions, and news, and engage with existing content by retweeting, favoriting, and replying to others' tweets. Non-protected tweets are publicly available and approximately 3% of tweets are voluntarily geotagged [5] . As Twitter has the advantage of real-time content availability, it has been harnessed during past infectious disease outbreaks to understand networks, gauge public knowledge, and forecast spread [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . In recent studies, we have utilized Twitter to better understand critical social and behavioral outcomes such as suicide risk [13 14] . Our findings have shown that certain patterns of word use on Twitter can define many social behaviors associated with suicide risk. Given that social distancing is the chief social behavioral measure taken to flatten the curve of COVID-19 spread, this study aims to quantify its perception, implementation, and impact on the nation, through Twitter.",

In these two maps, the higher prevalence of the \"implementation\" and \"social disruption\" facets in the west coast cities (Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle) compared to other major cities could be attributed to their status as major hubs for international flights, many of which originate from East Asia. The \"social disruption\" facet was particularly pronounced during the same time in these cities and others including Manhattan, NY and Washington, D.C., albeit more so in January. In February, we observed two notable peaks of \"social disruption\" (Figure 1 ) on February 3 rd and 23 rd that correspond and may be reactionary to travel restrictions taken into effect on the evening of February 2 nd and Italy going on a nationwide lockdown on the 23 rd [15 16 ].

In terms of favorites, \"implementation\" had the highest number of mean favorites per tweet and the least amplified was \"adaptation\". These results suggest that not only do users find these topics meaningful and worth engaging with, but also demonstrate that the topics of \"implementation\" and \"social disruption\" were highly broadcasted among social networks.

Similarly, we divided the number of all favorites of tweets in a facet by the total number of tweets in that facet to yield a score of average favorites per tweet. RESULTS: Descriptive Analysis Our final tweet dataset of 259,529 unique tweets from 115,485 unique users demonstrated an increasing level of coronavirus-related content over the study period. The total tweet count grew from 11,240 (4.3%) tweets in the final nine days of January to 33,713 (13.0%) tweets in February, and to 214,576 (82.7%) tweets in March. The number of unique users increased in a similar fashion, from 8,232 in January tweets, and 18,591 in February, to 100,979 in March. The cities with the highest number of tweets changed by month, but in March alone, 8,045 (3.7%) tweets originated from Los Angeles, CA, 6,325 (2.9%) tweets from Manhattan, NY, and 4,145 (1.9%) tweets from Washington, DC.",
