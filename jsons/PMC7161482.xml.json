In addition, we decided to dedicate 30 min of our weekly grand rounds to COVID-19 discussion, ongoing redeployment issues, and assessment of resident wellbeing, with two additional weekly check-ins held via video chat. We felt it imperative to openly discuss concerns and questions with departmental leadership, ensuring that expectations were set for all involved.

How long can a hematuria work-up be delayed? How long can we delay treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer or other high-risk cases before the risk of metastasis outweighs the risk of hospitalization during this time? How long can we delay routine oncologic surveillance imaging and endoscopy? These are some of the many questions we, as a specialty, need to address. Furthermore, it remains unclear if the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to new genitourinary disease states, either directly or indirectly via the behavioral responses of patients (eg, an increase in nephrolithiasis secondary to hypersupplementation with vitamin C).",
