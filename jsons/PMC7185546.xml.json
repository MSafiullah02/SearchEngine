Multi parameter NAAT allow broad spectrum detection of pathogens, thereby saving time and work.14 In addition, a study by Brunstein and colleagues reports preliminary clinical evidence that the diagnosis of co-infections is medically relevant and that an effective treatment for severe RTI requires the detection of all involved pathogens.15\n",
