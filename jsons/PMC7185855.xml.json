However, its long-term use could lead to adverse effects such as steroid-associated osteoporosis (SAOP) [1] and/or steroid-associated osteonecrosis (SAON) [2]. SAOP patients with decreased bone mineral density (BMD) are reported at higher risk of bone fracture [3] and the advanced SAON patients often suffered from joint collapse [4]. Physiologically, the skeleton undergoes remodeling, with osteoclasts for resorbing old bone and osteoblasts for forming new bone towards maintenance of bone homeostasis [5]. Corticosteroids impair osteoblastic osteogenesis and increase apoptosis of osteoblasts and osteocytes. This has been regarded as common pathway or the underlying mechanism of corticosteroids-associated bone deterioration in both SAOP and SAON [6].",

To evaluate metaphyseal trabecular architecture of femoral head, a pre-determined bone cylinder was used as ROI (3.5 mm diameter and 1.5 mm height) to quantify the volumetric bone mineral density (BMD), bone tissue volume fraction (BV/TV), connective density (Conn. D.), trabecular number (Tb. N), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), and trabecular separation (Tb. Sp) [16]. To evaluate cortical bone, femoral neck was used as ROI (0.6 mm thick) after re-alignment of micro-CT images using built-in software IPL (Image Processing Language) (Fig. 3A). A dual threshold technique was used for automatic segmentation of cortical ring of the femoral neck [17]. The first threshold for outer contour and the second threshold for inner contour were both set at 220 HU.

The mineral apposition rate (MAR), mineralizing surface (MS/BS), bone formation rate (BFR/BS), and osteoid thickness (O.Wi) were determined on the un-decalcified sections. The MS = dLS + 0.5sLS, where dLS = double-label surface, sLS = single-label surface. BS = total bone surface. MAR = inter-label width/time between injection. BFR/BS = MAR \u00d7 MS/BS [18].",

Th and Conn. D. of the metaphysical trabecular bone of the femoral head in the S-VC/S-NC group. The histomorphometry results showed that the bone loss was explained by the increased osteoclastic bone resorption with increased osteoclast number (N.Oc/BS) and eroded surface, while with decreased osteoblastic bone formation accompanied by a decreased mineral apposition rate (MAR) and bone formation rate (BFR/BS). It is well-known that corticosteroid induces bone resorption [19], [20], while long-term administration of corticosteroid would lead to the inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption and reducing of bone turnover [21]. Our induction protocol with pulsed high dose of corticosteroid administration simulated the clinical situation, such as the one developed for treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients in Hong Kong in 2003 that resulted in lower BMD at the hip of SAON patients [22], [23], while around the osteonecrotic lesions the osteoclasts were also stimulated to resorb necrotic trabecular bone in the repair process [24]. In this study, we investigated corticosteroid-associated bone loss using an established SAON rabbit model [14]. We found co-exist of osteonecrosis and osteoporosis in the same animal model. However, the ROIs of osteonecrosis and osteoporosis were different and this made our evaluation possible for comparison. The subchondral region, where with yellow bone marrow and low bone remodeling rate in normal rabbit but with elevated bone resorption and bone formation in model animal, was the ROI for studying the repair of osteonecrosis; while the metaphysis, where with red bone marrow and normal bone remodeling, was the ROI for assessing bone loss associated with corticosteroid treatment in the current study. Although the apoptosis of osteoblasts and osteocytes induced by pulsed LPS and MPS inevitably occurred, it has been regarded as common pathway or the underlying mechanism of corticosteroids-associated bone deterioration in both SAOP and SAON [6]. This formed a structural basis for our novel findings of Src siRNA in prevention of SAOP. In the current study the pulsed LPS and MPS treatment down-regulated the metabolic activity of osteoblasts, as shown by a decreased MAR in S-VC/S-NC group. Similar findings were also reported in previous studies of SAOP [25], [26]. However, the osteoblast surface (Ob.S/BS) and the mineralizing surface (MS/BS) were not significantly different between the S-VC and the normal control. This inconsistence might be explained that there was osteonecrotic repair progress in our animal model while purely SAOP had decreased osteoblast differentiation and proliferation [4], [21], [27], [28], [29]. Micro-CT images of femoral neck showed cortical thinning after the pulsed LPS-MPS treatment when compared with the normal control group at particular regions adjacent to greater trochanter and lesser trochanter, where cortical thickness was originally thinner and comparable to trabecular bone thickness to make these regions more sensitive to LPS-MPS. The overall changes in cortical thickness between were not found statistically significant that might be explained by rather short effects on cortical bone using our current pulsed MPS and LPS treatment protocol.",

However, the MAR and O.Wi in S-siSrc group were not different from that in the S-VC/S-NC group, implying that siSrc did not affect the function of the mature osteoblasts. This finding was also supported by an early work using Src knockdown mice in vivo\n[10]. It was reported that inhibition of Src in calvarial osteoblasts from mice in vitro could lead to enhanced ALP activity and nodule mineralization, and the enhanced ALP activity was related to the enhanced ALP positive cell numbers [10]. It is known that Src family inhibits osteoblasts through Src-YAP-Runx2 signaling pathway by tyrosine phosphorylation of yes-associated protein (YAP) and then suppressing Runx2 transcriptional activity [34], where Runx2 is the major transcription factor controlling osteoblastogenesis [35]. It was reported that Src stimulated IL-6 and then induced insulin-like growth factor 5 (IGFBP5), a Src activating factor only in immature osteoblasts to maintain osteoblasts in a less mature status. This suggested that there could be different pathways of Src in regulating immature and mature osteoblasts, and this might be the reason of inhibiting Src stimulated osteoblast differentiation and maturity but without stimulating osteoblast function [9]. In the present study, we found N.Oc/BS was not affected by siSrc, suggesting that Src had no direct effect on the osteoclast differentiation; however, siSrc significantly decreased ES/BS and increased N. Oc/ES, suggesting that siSrc could inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption by inhibiting the bone resorption function of the osteoclasts. Higher N. Oc/ES means that if no change of the number of osteoclasts (N.Oc), the eroded surface (ES) is lower, or interpreted by lower average activity of osteoclasts. The function of Src in osteoclasts was its role in regulation of cytoskeletal organization [12], and organized cytoskeleton in osteoclast showed its effect on synthesis and secretion of collagenolytic cysteine proteases, such as Cathepsin K, while inhibition of Src was reported to suppress the secretion of cathepsins and bone resorption in osteoclasts [36], implying Src's involvement in activating bone resorption as well. It was reported that the lifespan of osteoclasts is about 2 weeks in vivo, and the lifespan will be longer with glucocorticoid excess [37]. This explained that the biweekly treatment with siRNA should have sustaining therapeutic effects on osteoclastic bone resorption.",

            "text": "In our current study, we also found that siSrc could enhance cortical bone thickness and the polar moment of inertia (pMOI), an indicator of torsional rigidity. Micro-CT revealed that the femoral neck cortical thickness in S-siSrc group was significantly increased compared with that in the S-VC/S-NC group. Clinically, the BMD measurement at the femoral neck is a standardized measurement to diagnose osteoporosis [38], and it is found that pMOI is also correlated to bone strength apart from BMD [39]. The bone fractures occurred predominantly at cortical sites, so the quality of cortical bone at femoral neck played an important role to predict the fracture risk [40]. Our fluorescence labeling showed new bone formation on the endocortical surface and intracortical surface (Supplemental Fig. 1). On the endosteal surface, including endocortical, intracortical, and trabecular surface, cells communicated in trabecular and cortical bone for bone modeling and remodeling [41]. Src siRNA could enhance osteogenesis not only at trabecular surface but also the endosteal surface and intracortical surface to enhance the bone quality and decrease the bone fracture risk in the SAOP. Because of the limitation of micro-CT resolution used for the current study, we did not determine the cortical porosity of femoral neck. However it was reported that drugs with anti-resorptive effect could reduce cortical porosity [42], [43], while anabolic agents could increase cortical porosity with increased cortical thickness and decreased risk of fracture because of the larger porosity of newly formed bone near the marrow cavity [44], [45]. Src siRNA tested in the present study could inhibit Src activity that had dual functions, including anti-resorptive and anabolic effect that resulted in increased cortical bone quality. On the periosteal bone surface there are also abundant number of osteoblasts and preosteoclasts (mononuclear, TRAP +) responsible for cortical bone remodeling [46] and this suggested that knockdown Src in these cells would also have anti-resorptive and anabolic effect to increase periosteal diameter. However, due to limitation of micro-CT resolution and also variations in animal or bone size, the current cross-sectional study (group comparison) did not shown statistical difference in cortical periosteal (Ps.Dm) or endosteal diameter (Es.Dm). Longitudinal study (monitoring changes of bone size of same animal) with \u2018nano-scale\u2019 3D analysis is desirable in future study for studying the biological and therapeutic effects of our designed Src siRNA on bone remodeling at cortical bone. As the current study was related to a local injection, the Src inhibition effects were expected to show mainly in the bone marrow and endosteal surface. Future study would focus on R&D of a systemic administration of Src siRNA for its knockdown efficiency on cortical bone, especially the periosteal region.",
