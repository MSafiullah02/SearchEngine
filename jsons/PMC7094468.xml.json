It has been shown that all the protein functions required for SARS coronavirus replication are encoded by the replicase gene.4, 5 This gene encodes two overlapping polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab), from which the functional proteins are released by extensive proteolytic processing. This is primarily achieved by the 33 kDa main proteinase (Mpro), which is frequently also called 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) to indicate a similarity in substrate specificity with the 3C proteinase of picornaviruses. The 3C proteinase of rhinovirus has been selected as a target for the development of drugs against the common cold.6, 7 Similarly, the functional importance of the SARS-CoV Mpro in the viral life-cycle makes it a preferred target for discovering anti-SARS drugs.8, 9, 10, 11\n",

Domains I (residues 8\u2013101) and II (residues 102\u2013184) are \u03b2-barrels and together resemble the structure of chymotrypsin, whereas domain III (residues 201\u2013306) consists mainly of \u03b1-helices. Domains II and III are connected by a long loop (residues 185\u2013200). Located in a cleft between domains I and II, the active site of the Mpro comprises a catalytic dyad consisting of the conserved residues Cys145 and His41. A water molecule is hydrogen-bonded to His41 and can be considered the third component of a catalytic triad. In addition, in vitro experiments demonstrated that truncations of domain III reduced significantly or abolished completely the proteolytic activities of the main proteinases of HCoV 229E15 and TGEV.12 It was suggested that domain III of Mpro is required for keeping the proteolytic activity by holding domain II and the long loop (residues 185\u2013200) in a catalytically competent orientation,12 and/or that its main role is orienting the N-terminal residues that play an important role for the catalytic activity of the enzyme (see below and Yang et al.13).",

As a result, one protomer exists in an active and the other in an inactive conformation.13 In the latter, the S1 substrate-binding pocket has virtually collapsed as the consequence of the reorientation of Glu166, and the oxyanion hole no longer exists due to the conformational change of residues 138\u2013145 (see Figure 6(a) below). On the other hand, when the crystals are equilibrated at pH 7.6 or pH 8.0, both monomers are in an active conformation.13\n",

            "text": "Thus, the coronavirus Mpro is a very flexible protein, the conformational state of which appears to depend on the pH value of the medium. This is probably of biological significance, because the viral polyproteins (of which the Mpro is a domain before self-release by autocleavage) assemble on the late endosome where local pH tends to be acidic. Here, we analyze the conformational flexibility of the SARS-CoV Mpro in detail, and take the pH of the medium into account. We compare the results of molecular dynamics simulations with multiple crystal structures of the free enzyme, including two new crystal forms. In addition to the previously described monoclinic crystal form (space group P21), we obtained a tetragonal and an orthorhombic crystal form for the SARS-CoV Mpro (space groups P43212 and P21212). The corresponding refined structures provide valuable information on the flexibility of the enzyme when compared to one another and to the original structure in the monoclinic form. In addition, we describe several independent determinations of the structure in the monoclinic crystal form. The motivation for this is that unless protein crystals diffract to Bragg spacings of 1.5 \u00c5 or better, it is normally difficult to identify minor, i.e. less frequently occupied, conformations of flexible parts of a protein from one crystal. However, if different crystals that are grown at slightly deviating conditions are analyzed, one conformation of a flexible surface loop or amino acid side-chain may be selected as the predominant one in one crystal, and another conformation in the other. Thus, independent structural analyses of multiple crystals grown at almost but, in practice, never absolutely identical conditions, will provide useful information on the flexibility of the macromolecule under study. In the work presented here, minor differences in crystallization conditions were introduced by the presence of different weak inhibitors of the SARS-CoV Mpro in the crystallization set-ups. However, none of these compounds was found to have bound to the enzyme, as evidenced by the complete absence of even spurious difference density in the substrate-binding site. In our analysis, we focus on the pH-dependent rearrangements observed in the substrate-binding site and investigate the conformational changes that lead to activation/deactivation of the enzyme. We also address the question of why the monomeric proteinase shows little enzymatic activity, whereas the dimer is fully active.",

The crystallization conditions for the tetragonal form were identical to the previously established ones of the monoclinic form, and in fact, crystals of both forms often appeared simultaneously in the same crystallization droplet. Lower pH and slightly higher concentrations of the precipitant polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 (up to 20%) tended to favor the tetragonal form. The orthorhombic crystals were grown using 0.7 M sodium malonate (pH 6.6) as a precipitant. Details of diffraction data collection and structure solution as well as refinement of the new structures are provided in Table 1\n. The other five structures were determined from crystals of the original monoclinic form that had been grown at pH 6.0. The resolutions of the latter structural models varied between 2.14\u00c5 and 2.8 \u00c5, and the crystallographic R factors were between 21.0% and 23.8%. The structures derived from monoclinic crystals confirm the findings reported with the original structure of the enzyme:13 monomer A is in an active conformation, with the S1 substrate-binding subsite accessible and the oxyanion loop, residues 138\u2013145, in the catalytically competent conformation, whereas both features have collapsed in monomer B of the dimer, which therefore is considered inactive. In contrast to the monoclinic crystals, which feature an Mpro dimer in the asymmetric unit, there is only a monomer in the asymmetric unit in the tetragonal (P43212) and orthorhombic (P21212) crystal forms, with the dimer being created through crystallographic symmetry. In both of the new crystal forms, which had been obtained at pH 5.9 and 6.6, respectively, the monomers are in the inactive conformation, leading to dimers with both subunits being inactive.",

These protonation states were correlated with the pH of the system, and were assumed on the basis of the hydrogen-bonding pattern derived from the crystal structures and chosen to represent all relevant possible combinations (see Materials and Methods for charge assignment). In the cases of the simulations at pH 6.0, 7.6, and 8.0, the starting structure was the (energy-minimized) X-ray structure derived from monoclinic crystals grown at the respective pH.13 For the state in which His163 is protonated in both monomers of the dimer (here called pH 5.0), no crystal structure was available at the time of the simulation; therefore, the starting model for this was the monoclinic crystal structure at pH 6.0, but with His163 in both protomers positively charged. Since this simulation was carried out, we have obtained the new crystal forms, which presumably have His163 protonated in both monomers. Thus, the new structures provide an experimental check of the predictions derived from the MD calculations. In fact, a comparison of the 10 ns snapshot of the MD simulation at pH 5.0 and the new crystal structures shows that, while there are significant deviations on a residue-by-residue basis in domain III, where some loops have a rather large amplitude of motion during the simulation, the region around the substrate-binding site, including the oxyanion loop 138\u2013145, agrees quite well. The new X-ray structures thus confirm the relevance of our MD simulations, which were apparently able to transform one conformation of the SARS-CoV Mpro into the other. The nature of these pH-dependent rearrangements will be discussed below.",

The experimental B factors are transformed to the RMSF using the formula \u3008\u0394ri2\u3009=3Bi/(8\u03c02), where ri2 is a coordinate vector of the ith atom.

Figure 3(e) and (f) display the RMS values for both protomer A and B obtained from the multiple X-ray structure determinations carried out with monoclinic crystals grown at pH 6.0. Also, the corresponding RMS values for the tetragonal and orthorhombic crystal structures are included in Figure 3(f). These comparative data show a reasonably good agreement between the residue fluctuations derived from the MD simulations (Figure 3(a) and (b)) and the two sets of values obtained from the X-ray determination (Figure 3(c)\u2013(f)). The RMS profiles reveal the most flexible parts of the proteinase, which are the loops L1 (residues 138\u2013145), L2 (residues 165\u2013172) and L3 (residues 185\u2013200) around the substrate-binding pocket (as shown in Figure 1(a)), as well as surface residues 153\u2013155 and 274\u2013277 in each of the two protomers (shaded areas in Figure 3). As will be discussed below, all these loops except the last are associated with the flexibility of the substrate-binding pocket. This is also true for the 310-helical segment 45\u201349, where an insertion is found in SARS-CoV Mpro (compared to other coronavirus main proteinases) and which was difficult to model in the X-ray structures due to its flexibility. In addition, most residues involved in the monomer\u2013monomer interface of the dimer, such as Ala7, Val125, and Glu290, show reduced fluctuations, while Ser139, Phe140, and Glu166, although contributing to the same dimerization interface, exhibit very high fluctuations, indicating that these residues play a special role (see below). The dimer appears not to be very stable, given the fact that at concentrations below 1 mg/ml, the coronavirus main proteinase exists predominantly as a monomer.12 The K\nD for dissociation of the SARS-CoV dimer has been reported as about 100 \u03bcM18 or 227 \u03bcM,17 although a much lower value has also been determined.42\n",

Polgar19 has shown that it exists as a thiolate\u22efimidazolium pair in papain-like proteinases, where the thiolate ion can be stabilized by the positive end of the permanent dipole of a long (24 residue) \u03b1-helix. However, coronavirus main proteinases (domains I/II) and picornavirus proteinases have a fold that is completely different from papain; instead, it resembles that of the serine proteinase, chymotrypsin, but with an active-site serine-to-cysteine substitution. As a consequence, there is no long \u03b1-helix available that could stabilize the thiolate anion, and indeed, Polgar20 has proposed that rhinovirus 2A proteinase contains a hydrogen-bonded thiol\u22efimidazole pair.",

This observation appears to support the idea that the nucleophile in this proteinase is the uncharged thiol, with His41 acting as a general base. Therefore, Cys145 and His41 of the catalytic dyad were left uncharged in all MD simulation runs in this work. In the various crystal structures of SARS-CoV Mpro, the cysteine\u2013histidine distance is between 3.6 \u00c5 and 3.9 \u00c5. The cysteine\u2013histidine distance of SARS-CoV Mpro as a function of simulation time was monitored during the MD calculation and found to fluctuate in the range of 3.5\u20134.5 \u00c5. In a recent MD simulation of a homology model for the SARS-CoV Mpro monomer built on the basis of the TGEV Mpro crystal structure, Pang22 obtained distances of 1.8\u20133.3 \u00c5 between the S\u03b3 atom of Cys145 and the N\u03b52 of His41. The lower value is definitely by far too short and would actually correspond to a covalent S\u2013N bond between the two residues. The values obtained in our simulations certainly agree much better with the experimental observations made by X-ray crystallography.",

In the crystal structures of the coronavirus Mpros, a buried water molecule is found in the position that would normally be occupied by the side-chain of the third member of the catalytic triad.8, 12, 13 The water molecule forms three hydrogen bonds with His41, His163/164 (or Gln163, in HCoV 229E Mpro), and Asp186/187 (Figure 4\n; where two residue numbers are given, the first refers to TGEV and HCoV 229E, and the second to SARS-CoV). This hydrogen-bonding system remains intact almost over the entire simulation time, with little fluctuation. At no time during our simulations did residue Asp187 change its conformation to replace the water molecule and form a direct interaction with His41; instead, during most of the simulation time, the aspartate residue remained engaged in a salt-bridge with Arg40 (see Figure 4), thereby bridging domains I and II of the proteinase. However, in his recent MD simulation on a homology model of the SARS-CoV Mpro monomer in complex with a peptide substrate, Pang22 observed that Asp187 did change its conformation and interacted with His41, thereby replacing the water molecule and forming a catalytic triad. He proposed that the presence of a substrate with a P1\u2032 residue would shield the catalytic triad from solvent so that the conformational change could take place. Since we do not have a substrate in our simulations of the Mpro dimer, we cannot comment on this observation; unfortunately, Pang's report neither mentions the charge of His41 in the simulation nor the fate of Arg40, which would lose its interaction partner as a consequence of the reorientation of Asp187.",

The substrate was the pentadecapeptide SWTSAVLQSGFRKWA. This peptide corresponds to the N-terminal autocleavage site of the SARS-CoV Mpro, with the exception of the P7 Ile, which had been replaced by Trp, and the P6\u2032 Met, which had also been replaced by Trp. The fluorescence emission of the two tryptophan residues at 353 nm was used to quantify substrate and products. The k\ncat/K\nM of our enzyme preparation with this substrate was 61.9(\u00b11.5) mM\u22121min\u22121 and thus about sixfold higher than what was reported by Fan et al.,18 albeit for a shorter peptide substrate. We found the pH-activity curve to be bell-shaped, with the maximum enzymatic activity at pH 7.0 (see Figure 5\n). This finding agrees reasonably well with that by Huang et al.,21 who reported an activity maximum at pH 7.4 using a colorimetric cleavage assay.",

            "text": "The four different MD simulations of the SARS-CoV Mpro dimer described here correspond to the various pH-dependent protonation states of residues His163 and His172 in the substrate-binding site (see Table 2). His163, an absolutely conserved residue at the bottom of the S1 specificity pocket, has been shown to form a hydrogen bond between its N\u03b52 atom and the side-chain carbonyl oxygen of the P1 glutamine residue of the substrate (Figure 6\n(a), right image).8, 13 It is important for maintaining the absolute specificity of the Mpro for glutamine in the P1 position of the substrate that His163 is not protonated; a positive charge of this histidine in an otherwise largely hydrophobic environment would probably enable glutamate (in addition to glutamine) to enter the S1 pocket. Near neutral pH and above, the protonation of His163 is prevented by a hydrophobic interaction with the aromatic ring of Phe140, and also by a strong hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group of Tyr161 (hydrogen donor) and His163 N\u03b41. Yang et al.13 had proposed that the conformational changes of the SARS-CoV Mpro observed in one monomer (B) but not the other (monomer A) in the dimer crystallized at pH 6.0 could be caused by protonation of His163 at this pH, which is presumably close to the pK of this residue. The main elements of the observed conformational transition (see Figure 6(a), left and middle images) from monomer A (His163 unprotonated) to monomer B (His163 protonated) and their interpretation by Yang et al.13 were as follows.(1)The side-chain of Phe140 retracts itself from the interaction with His163, presumably due to the protonation of the latter.(2)Since Phe140 is part of the oxyanion loop, this segment (residues 138\u2013145) changes its structure significantly. In the resulting conformation, the loop is no longer able to stabilize the tetrahedral transition state of the proteolytic reaction.(3)In order to neutralize the positive charge on His163, Glu166, which along with His172 forms a wall of the S1 pocket in the conformation observed at pH 7.6 as well as in molecule A of the pH 6.0 dimer, moves \u201cinward\u201d towards His163, thereby breaking its interactions with His172 and the amino terminus (residue Ser1) of the other monomer (A) in the dimer.(4)When the amino terminus of molecule A loses its interaction with Glu166 of molecule B, the hydrogen bonds between Ser1 and the main chain of Phe140 are also lost. This contributes to the conformational change of the oxyanion loop, residues 138\u2013145.\n",

This alternative, inactive conformation appears to be quite stable, as it even persisted upon addition of a substrate-analogous inhibitor that was observed to covalently bind to the enzyme in its inactive conformation but was not able to induce the active form and penetrate the S1 pocket.13 The fact that the inactivating conformational changes occur only in one of the two molecules in the monoclinic crystal structure of the SARS-CoV Mpro dimer is in agreement with the proteolytic activity of the enzyme being about 50% at pH 6.0 (see Figure 5). This pH value is presumably close to the pK value of His163, a notion that is confirmed by the fact that in our new tetragonal crystal form of the SARS-CoV Mpro, which was obtained at a pH value slightly below pH 6.0, both monomers adopt the inactive conformation, with the amino terminus of the other protomer in the dimer not interacting with Phe140 and Glu166. This is also the case for the other new crystal form, which belongs to the orthorhombic system and was obtained at pH 6.6, i.e. again near the presumable pK of His163. However, it should be noted that both these new crystal forms contain a SARS-CoV Mpro dimer that is created by crystallographic symmetry from identical monomers; thus, there is no option for the dimer to adopt different conformations in its monomers. Interestingly, the pH-dependent conformational switch can apparently also occur in the orthorhombic form, since an isomorphous crystal structure recently deposited at the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (code 2BW6) but not yet published has both monomers in the active conformation, even though it was obtained at pH 6.5 (J. Lescar, personal communication).",

As it is engaged in a salt-bridge with Glu166 at the outer wall of the site (Figure 6(a)), its pK value should be elevated by about two units, compared to isolated histidine residues.23 Yang et al.\n13 had also determined the X-ray structure of the SARS-CoV Mpro after equilibration of the crystals at pH 8.0 and described it as being very similar to the structure at pH 7.6, i.e. both monomers in the dimer were in the active conformation. However, when we closely inspected their pH 8.0 structure, we noticed that there was no salt-bridge any longer between His172 and Glu166 in either of the two monomers, while the interaction between Glu166 of monomer A and the amino terminus of the other monomer (B) in the dimer still existed (see Figure 6(b) and (c)). As a consequence, Glu166 should have more freedom to move at pH 8.0 than at pH 7.6, and one motivation for our MD simulations was to find out whether it makes use of this potential.",

Several key distances indicative of conformational changes were monitored throughout the simulation: (1) Glu166\u2013His163; (2) Glu166\u2013His172; (3) Glu166\u2013Ser1 amide nitrogen of the other monomer; and (4) Phe140 (center of mass of phenyl ring)\u2013His163 (center of mass of imidazole ring) (Figure 8\n). At the outset of the pH 6.0 MD simulation (Figure 7(a)), Glu166 does not orient towards the non-protonated His163 in protomer A, but is stably oriented towards the charged His163 in protomer B. The interaction between Glu166 and His172 is a stable ion pair in the A chain during the first three nanoseconds. Thereafter, the distance between these two residues fluctuates up to about 8 \u00c5 and then back to form a hydrogen bond at about 8.5 ns. We analyzed the intermediate structure and found that sometimes Glu166 can form hydrogen bonds with the amides of Gly143, Ser144 or Cys145, i.e. the hydrogen-bonding donors of the oxyanion hole. These hydrogen bonds are not stable throughout the simulation, but form and break occasionally. In contrast, in protomer B, Glu166 adopts a relatively stable intermediate position where it interacts simultaneously with His163 and His172 (both of which are protonated). His163 of protomer A makes a weak hydrophobic interaction with Phe140 for most of the simulation time. The amino terminus of the other protomer (B) in the dimer forms a salt-bridge with Glu166 of protomer A and hydrogen bonds with the main chain of Phe140, although this is clearly getting weaker after about 3 ns into the simulation. In molecule B, in contrast, Glu166 does not interact with Ser1A and is instead oriented towards the now protonated His163, thereby blocking the S1 pocket. Furthermore, Phe140B stays away from His163B (as in the X-ray structure), and the oxyanion hole collapses. Thus, the MD simulation at pH 6.0 nicely confirms what has been seen in the crystal structures13 and supports the interpretation made on this basis (compare Figure 6, Figure 7).",

It is found that this is due to the fact that in the initial structure, these two rings are not stacked, so their interaction may be weaker than the stack in monomer A at pH 6.0. At pH 8.0, Glu166 is more flexible with no hydrogen bonds with either His163 or His172 (Figure 7, Figure 8). This is likely due to the fact that His172 as well as His163 are non-protonated at this pH.

Dimerization of the proteinase occurs mainly through the interactions between the helical domain III of each monomer, and through hydrogen bonding between the amino-terminal residues of one monomer and residues near the S1 subsite of the other monomer, in particular Phe140 and Glu166.8, 12, 13 The N-terminal residue (Ser1 in SARS-CoV) has been proposed to keep both the oxyanion hole and Glu166 of the other monomer in a catalytically competent conformation; Yang et al.\n13 coined the term of an \u201cN-finger\u201d that switches on the activity of the other monomer. In agreement with this, Anand et al.\n12 observed in the TGEV Mpro system that deletion of the first five residues from the N terminus abolished peptidolytic activity of the enzyme almost entirely. This is not due to a destruction of the dimer, since the SARS-CoV Mpro still forms a dimer when the first seven residues from the amino terminus are missing.17 Thus, the amino terminus, as such, is essential for enzymatic activity of the dimer. Accordingly, we carried out preliminary 10 ns MD simulations of the monomer, starting from the active conformation as found in monomer A of the crystal structure determined at pH 6.0. Intriguingly, these resulted in a collapse of the oxyanion hole because of the missing hydrogen bond between the N terminus of the other chain and the main chain of Phe140. Also, not held in position by the same N terminus, Glu166 tended to move towards His163 and block the entry of the S1 pocket, at least during part of the simulation time. These observations clarify the role of the N terminus of the other monomer in the dimer: it is needed to maintain the proper shape of the substrate-binding site, including the oxyanion hole, of the \u201cparent\u201d monomer.",

            "text": "The SARS coronavirus main proteinase (Mpro) shows pH-dependent conformational flexibility, in particular around the substrate-binding site. We have assessed this flexibility by multiple X-ray structures (in the original crystal form as well as in two new crystal forms) and by MD simulations. The latter take into account different protonation states of two histidine residues (His163 and His172) in the substrate-binding site. Overall, we find good agreement between the flexibility data derived from the multiple crystal structures, from atomic temperature factors, and from the MD calculations. The catalytic dyad of Cys145 and His41 is confirmed to exist throughout the MD simulation; at no time is it complemented by a third residue such as Asp187. The conformation and the volume of the S1 binding pocket are controlled by the protonation states of the two histidine residues that are part of the pocket and we propose that the flanks of the bell-shaped pH-activity curve are governed by the protonation of His163 (on the low-pH side) and the deprotonation of His172 (on the high-pH side). Intriguingly, in our MD simulation of the SARS-CoV Mpro monomer, the S1 pocket spontaneously collapses and adopts the inactive conformation that is also seen upon protonation of His163 in the dimeric structure. We conclude that the amino terminus of the other monomer in the dimer plays an important role for the enzyme's activity by maintaining the shape of the oxyanion loop and of the S1 pocket through hydrogen bonds.",

An additional screen for improving the crystallization conditions was carried out using the \u201cAnion Suite\u201d of Nextal Biotechnologies (Montreal, Canada) and condition no. 36 (1.2 M sodium malonate in 0.1 M Mes, pH 6.5) yielded orthorhombic crystals belonging to space group P21212. These were optimized at 0.7 M sodium malonate (pH 6.6). This crystal form is similar, if not identical, to the one recently described by Hsu et al.14 Since coordinates of the structure described by these authors are not yet available, we solved the structure of the orthorhombic crystal form as well. To some crystallization setups, inhibitors were added that had been identified in an in silico screening effort9 and subsequently synthesized or purchased. In other cases, crystals of the free enzyme were soaked in solutions containing the inhibitor in DMSO. For several of these cases, X-ray structure analysis showed that the inhibitors had not bound to the proteinase. Therefore, the resulting multiple structures of the free enzyme were used to analyze the flexibility of the Mpro. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the Joint University of Hamburg/IMB Jena/EMBL synchrotron beamline X13 at DESY, Hamburg, Germany, at a wavelength of \u223c0.80 \u00c5. Intensities were measured by a MarCCD detector and processed using the HKL suite.24 Crystal structures were determined by molecular replacement and difference Fourier methods, using the original X-ray structure for the SARS-CoV Mpro crystallized at pH 6.0 (PDB code 1UJ113) as the initial model. CNS25 and, in later stages of refinement, REFMAC26 were employed for X-ray structure refinement. Electron density interpretation and model building were performed using the computer graphics programs O27 and XtalView.28\n",

Since a crystal structure at a pH below 6.0 was not available at the time when these simulations were carried out, we used 1UJ1.pdb (pH 6.0) as the initial structural model, but with all histidine residues in the substrate-binding site (except His41) fully protonated. Prior to the simulations at pH 5.0, pH 6.0, and pH 7.6, residues SerA1 and GlyA2, which had not been visible in the electron density maps,13 were modeled using the molecular modeling software Sybyl 6.8 (Tripos Associates, St Louis, MO, 2000). The modeled conformation at the beginning of each simulation was similar to that of residues SerB1 and GlyB2 of the other polypeptide chain in the dimer, which did exhibit well-defined electron density. The program package MacroDox version 3.2.229 was used to assign the titratable residues in the protein. The resulting charges of ionizable groups were appropriate for all four pH values studied, with all Arg and Lys residues protonated, and all Asp and Glu deprotonated. The protonation state of histidine residues was adopted from the MacroDox results, with the exception of His41 (see below) and of His163 and His172, which are associated with the S1 substrate-binding subsite and are at the focus of the present study. Both the His163 residues of the A and the B chain of the Mpro dimer were protonated in the simulation at pH 5.0, and unprotonated at pH 7.6 and 8.0. At pH 6.0, His163 was deprotonated in the A chain of the dimer, and protonated in the B chain. His172 of both chains was protonated at pH 5.0, pH 6.0 and pH 7.6, but deprotonated in both chains at pH 8.0 (Table 2). Cys145 and His41 of the catalytic dyad were uncharged in all simulations, in agreement with the recent findings by Huang et al.\n21\n",

This peptide corresponds to the N-terminal autocleavage site of the SARS-CoV Mpro, with the exception of the P7 Ile, which had been replaced by Trp, and the P6\u2032 Met, which had also been replaced by Trp. The concentrations of SARS-CoV Mpro and substrate were 0.83 \u03bcM and 0.55 mM, respectively. The reactions were carried out at different pH values in 36 mM buffer solution. The buffer was sodium acetate for pH values between 4.5 and 5.6, bis-Tris for pH 5.8\u20137.0, bis-Tris-propane for pH 7.0\u20139.4. The enzymatic activity was found to be reduced by 20% in bis-Tris-propane buffer and this was corrected for. Reactions were run for 15 min and then stopped by addition of 0.1% trifluoric acid. After 5 min cooling on ice, samples were centrifuged and 90 \u03bcl of the supernatant were mixed with 60 \u03bcl of HPLC sample buffer. Separation of products and substrate was carried out using a reverse-phase (RP) HPLC column (Jupiter 4\u03bc Proteo 90A; Phenomenex) and a linear gradient (1%\u201390%) of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Detection of products and substrate was achieved using a fluorescence detector (RF1002, Gynkotec) at 353 nm.",
