Functional evaluation showed platelet hyper-reactivity, increased B cell receptor-triggered calcium influx and ERK phosphorylation. Expression of the altered p.(Met1141Lys) variant in a PLC\u03b32knockout DT40 cell line showed clearly enhanced BCR-triggered influx of external calcium when compared to controltransfected cells. Our results further expand the molecular basis of pediatric CVID and phenotypic spectrum of PLC\u03b32-related defects.",

IP 3 increases intracellular calcium levels by inducing the release of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium stores. The released intracellular Ca 2+ leads to the translocation of additional PLC\u03b32 to the plasma membrane, where its activation leads to the sustained influx of extracellular Ca 2+ across the plasma membrane [1] .",

The majority of these mutations occur in the autoinhibitory C-terminal SH2 domain, conferring gain-of-function activity (Fig. 2a) . These PLCG2 variants have also been described as somatic mutations causing clonal expansion in Ibrutinib-resistant chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) [5] . Another hotspot region in the PLC\u03b32 protein associated with Ibrutinib resistance mutations is amino acids 1139 to 1141 within the C2 domain which is involved in calcium binding and membrane anchoring of PLC\u03b32 [6] .",

            "text": "In antigen-stimulated B cells, the first transient Ca 2+ flux is caused by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP 3 ) binding to IP 3 receptors (IP 3 R), which triggers rapid Ca 2+ release from finite internal Ca 2+ stores in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This initial phase of receptor-activated Ca 2+ signaling is followed by a sustained influx of extracellular Ca 2+ across the plasma membrane [1, 29] . The C2 domain of PLC\u03b32, in which this mutation resides, has previously been shown to play two roles in this second phase. Firstly, the initial Ca 2+ flux via IP 3 R promotes lipase-independent translocation of additional PLC\u03b32 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane leading to more production of IP 3 and DAG after binding to the adapter protein BLNK [1] . DAG in turn activates more influx of Ca 2+ by directly activating transient receptor potential cation (TRPC) Ca 2+ channels in the plasma membrane [30] . The C2 domain is critical for this Ca 2+ entry-dependent translocation of PLC\u03b32 as deletion of one of the expected Ca 2+ binding sites in the C2 domain of PLC\u03b32 (\u03941138E-1140D) results in the absence of this second sustained phase [1] . The proximity of the amino acid substitution in the patient's PLC\u03b32 (M1141K) to this putative calcium-binding site may result in the formation of a higher affinity Ca 2+ binding site, leading to increased IP 3 and DAG production. Secondly, binding of the PLC\u03b32 SH2 domain to BLNK is stabilized by the PLC\u03b32 C2 domain in a Ca 2+ -regulated manner [31] . Interestingly, total deletion of the C2 domain in PLC\u03b32 ablated both intracellular and extracellular BCR-triggered Ca 2+ responses [1] . The additional requirement of the C2 domain for the initial BCRmediated Ca 2+ flux could be explained by the universal role of C2 domains in promoting binding to phospholipid bilayers. A mutation within the C2 domain has the potential to affect the association of PLC\u03b32 with the plasma membrane. For example, mutants that increase the positive surface charge of the C2 domain in p110\u03b1, a catalytic subunit of PI3K involved in tonic BCR signaling, lead to a gain-of-function [32] . This is analogous to our variant as methionine is substituted with positively charged lysine at position 1141.",

There are notable differences in the dermatological presentation as patients #1 and #2 appear to have a broader spectrum of cutaneous manifestations including urticarial, granulomatous, and vesiculobullous rashes, while patient #3 has no significant cutaneous findings to date. One of the limitations of our study is that we were unable to obtain a more detailed functional profile of hematopoietic cells in these two patients as was done with patient #3.",

These mice were viable but had decreased mature B cells, a block in pro-B cell differentiation, and B1 B cell deficiency. IgM receptorinduced Ca 2+ flux and proliferation in response to B cell mitogens was absent. Ig levels were reduced and T cellindependent antibody production was absent. Fc\u03b3R signaling was also defective, resulting in a loss of collagen-induced platelet aggregation, mast cell Fc\u03b5R function, and NK cell Fc\u03b3RIII and 2B4 function [35] . Targeted deletion of Plc\u03b32 in germinal center B cells demonstrated an additional essential role in the maintenance of memory B cells [36] . To date, there are no reported cases of humans with PLC\u03b32 deficiency. This suggests that PLC\u03b32 activity may be tightly regulated in normal B cell development; a decrease in PLC\u03b32 activity results in diminished BCR signaling that strongly impairs development of transitional B cells [37] , while BCR hyper-reactivity causes B cell apoptosis. Either way, there is a defect in B cell development.",
