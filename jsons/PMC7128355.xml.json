            "text": "The term acute phase reaction (APR) describes a series of pathophysiological events that occur in animals exposed to potentially pathogenic stimuli. The pathogenesis of the APR begins within inflammatory sites, where cells involved in the innate immune response (i.e., macrophages and, to a lesser extent, neutrophils) produce and release pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 (Bochsler and Slauson, 2002). A similar pattern of cytokine production is however also involved in the host response to some types of tumours that are thus able to evoke a typical APR even in the absence of exogenous inflammatory stimuli. IL-6, for example, can be produced by a number of different cell types (such as keratinocytes, endothelial cells and fibroblasts) under the influence of circulating IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1. This cytokine activation and release leads to high levels of IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in the blood (Moshage, 1997, Gabay and Kushner, 1999).",

In addition, the stimulation of the CNS results in activation of a variety of responses, mostly mediated by the hypothalamo\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal and hypothalamo\u2013pituitary\u2013gonadal axes, inducing behavioural changes including lethargy, anorexia, adipsia and a disinterest in social and sexual activities (Karrow, 2006, Owen-Ashley et al., 2006).",

These two molecules interact with nicotinic and adrenergic receptors, which are expressed in various cell types, including hypothalamic and immune-inflammatory cells. The activation of the ANS can thus depress the release of cytokines by inflammatory cells and influence hypothalamic responses, thus modulating the APR (Karrow, 2006). These multi-directional communication pathways, which are summarised in Fig. 1\n, have been recently explored in humans and in laboratory animals. No data about possible peculiarities of the feline neuroendocrine response are available, but anorexia, depression and behavioural changes are frequently seen in cats during inflammation.",

Although techniques to investigate cytokine gene expression have already been established in cats (Rottman et al., 1995, Kipar et al., 2001, Gelain et al., 2006), the majority of studies on cytokine production by feline cells have examined the response to specific virus infections (Gunn-Moore et al., 1998, Linenberger and Deng, 1999, Dean et al., 2003, Foley et al., 2003, Kiss et al., 2004, Dean et al., 2006, Kipar et al., 2006) and little is known about the molecular pathogenesis of feline APR. What information is available, however, indicates that the production of cytokines by feline monocytes decreases from youth to middle age then increases in the elderly cat, thus explaining the frequent appearance of inflammatory conditions in younger and older animals (Kipar et al., 2005). It would also seem that pro-inflammatory cytokines are produced in cats in response to LPS treatment (Otto and Rawlings, 1995) as has been demonstrated in other species.",

Cortisol might modulate the inflammatory response and exert a local anti-inflammatory effect, but at a systemic level it is involved in determining both leucocytosis and APP production. Cortisol has multiple effects on inflammatory/immune cells, mainly mediated by modulation of the expression of cytokines, adhesion molecules and molecules involved in leukocyte maturation, differentiation and trafficking, and is responsible for the first wave of neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leucocytes, or PMNs) that appears in the blood just after an inflammatory stimulus.",

The increase in cortisol induces a rapid increase in circulating leucocytes since, in association with IL-1, cortisol causes a decreased adhesiveness to the endothelium of mature neutrophils belonging to the so called marginal pool, which become detached from the endothelium and enter the blood (Smith, 2000). This is particularly important in cats, since the ratio between circulating and marginal pool leucocytes is about 1:3, whereas in other species it is nearer 1:1 (Cowell and Decker, 2000, Smith, 2000). The cells belonging to the marginal pool cannot, however, sustain the peripheral demand of phagocytes for a long time, since neutrophils are short-lived cells, and most will leave the circulation by diapedesis to move into inflamed tissues where they are attracted by exogenous or endogenous chemoattractants.",

In healthy individuals, the maturation of feline neutrophils takes about 6 days, but it is longer in calves and humans (7 and 14 days, respectively). Once released into the bloodstream, the half-life of feline neutrophils ranges from 5.5 to 7.6 h. They then move into the tissues where they die by apoptosis within 4 days (Smith, 2000). During inflammation, maturation time is accelerated by cytokines and steroids, and within 12\u201324 h (approximately when PMNs released from the marginal pool begin to die and disappear from the circulation) newly formed PMNs appear in the circulation. Cytokines accelerate the delivery of PMNs to the inflamed tissues, thereby reducing the half-life of circulating PMNs; moreover, apoptosis is delayed by glucocorticoids, TNF and IFN-\u03b3, thus increasing the life of PMNs in tissues. It is therefore important to note that the dynamics of neutrophils during inflammation differ from that found in normal, healthy individuals.",

Other possible sources of \u2018hyperacute\u2019 leucocytosis are common in cats, especially as a consequence of excitement, fear or stress (Cowell and Decker, 2000).

Compared to baseline values, which are often negligible, some APPs increase by less than 2-fold, others 3- to 10-fold or even 10- to 1000-fold (Table 1\n). Based on these magnitudes, APPs have been classified as \u2018minor\u2019, \u2018moderate\u2019 or \u2018major\u2019 (Bochsler and Slauson, 2002, Murata et al., 2004, Petersen et al., 2004, Ceron et al., 2005). The magnitude of the increase varies in different species and each has its own major and minor APPs (Ceron et al., 2005). Some authors prefer to use the terms \u2018minor\u2019 or \u2018major\u2019 on the basis of which protein more frequently increases in a given species, independent of the magnitude of the increase (Gruys and Toussaint, 2001). These two different ways of classifying positive APPs partly overlap since in many cases the protein that most frequently increases in a given species also shows a higher magnitude of increases compared to other species. The important concept is that each animal species has its own \u2018major\u2019 APP that must be considered the marker of choice for diagnostic purposes (see Table 1). In cats, the positive APPs which play a major role in the diagnostic approach are SAA and AGP (Petersen et al., 2004, Ceron et al., 2005).",

Most feline APP studies have been focused on AGP, SAA and, to a lesser extent, Hp - the three proteins which have been shown to work as major APPs in the cat. Pathophysiological conditions in which increased AGP, SAA or Hp concentrations have been recorded are listed in Table 2\n. All of these proteins, with the exception of CRP, were higher in hospitalised cats compared to healthy controls, and all showed a 2\u20134 fold increase 24 h after surgery, independent of the presence of possible post-surgical complications, or after experimentally induced inflammation (Kajikawa et al., 1999).",

FIP is a lethal disease caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV) that is difficult to diagnose by conventional approaches (Addie et al., 2004). AGP increases in FIP have been identified for many years during experimental infections (Stoddart et al., 1988). In tissues harvested from cats with FIP, AGP seems to be associated with viral antigen and is present in large amounts (Paltrinieri et al., 2004), together with a low-molecular weight AGP-like molecule which is also expressed on inflammatory cells (Paltrinieri et al., 2003). Studies of spontaneous infections have confirmed that although high serum AGP concentration can be found in cats with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection, AGP increases are so evident as to be diagnostic for the disease (Duthie et al., 1997). Similarly, high AGP levels within effusions can be used to confirm a clinical suspicion of wet FIP (Bence et al., 2005). Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated that non-symptomatic shedders of FCoV also have cyclic fluctuations of serum AGP, probably due to continuous re-infection (Giordano et al., 2004). Based on this finding, AGP levels should be interpreted with caution in cats living in catteries where the disease is endemic.",

Interestingly, the fluctuation in AGP levels in clinically healthy, FCoV-positive cats (Giordano et al., 2004) occurred a few days before the occurrence of episodes of FIP in a cattery, when the percentage of FCoV-shedders and median antibody titres also increased in those cats that remained healthy (Paltrinieri et al., 2007b). In contrast, after FIP outbreaks, antibody titres, percentage of shedders and AGP levels of cats that did not develop the disease decreased, but increased the degree of \u03b1(2\u20133) syalilation of serum AGP (Paltrinieri et al., 2006). These findings raise interesting questions about possible FCoV\u2013AGP interactions that might play a pathogenic role in FIP or indeed a protective role against FCoV infection, depending on the glycoforms, and also on the possible roles of \u03b1(2\u20133) and \u03b1(2\u20136) syalic acid as binding molecules of coronaviruses and other pathogenic viruses (Schwegmann-Wessels and Herrler, 2006).",
