Inhalation injury is well known to be an independent risk factor for mortality and is also associated with significant morbidity, which may be observed as early or late sequelae [7, 8]. Immediately following inhalation injury, risk of respiratory distress and airway compromise frequently necessitate the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation. Patients with significant airway involvement of their burn often develop direct mucosal injury to the respiratory tract, mucosal sloughing, and inflammation (Fig. 1), potentially leading to airway obstruction and impaired gas exchange. These physiological changes in addition to higher fluid resuscitation requirements lead to an increased risk for pulmonary and airway oedema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and therefore longer duration of mechanical ventilation and length of stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) [9]. Potential late consequences of inhalation injury may also occur. These may evidence as scarring, contracture and stenosis or stricture of the mucosal tissue, with subsequent impacts on physiological function of those structures affected [10].",

A number of predictive factors for dysphagia development post burns have also been identified [11] and subsequently validated [13]. These factors, with consideration to advancing age, include the presence of head and neck burns, total burn surface area (TBSA) \u2265 18%, need for ICU admission and mechanical ventilation, and presence of tracheostomy\u2014and inhalation injury. However, whilst inhalation injury has been identified as a predictor for dysphagia and its complications, the incidence and severity of dysphagia, and the pattern of recovery specifically in the subset of patients with burn injury and associated inhalation injury are not well understood.",

In many cases, complete recovery can be achieved prior to hospital discharge [14, 15], although a small proportion of patients will experience more severe swallowing impairment with a lengthy and at times incomplete recovery [14, 16]. Initiation of oral intake following burn injury has been documented to take longer in patients identified with dysphagia than in those without [14\u201323] with lengthy periods of enteral nutrition often necessary. Resolution of dysphagia after burn injury also follows a variable, and sometimes protracted period of recovery. Burn patients, identified with dysphagia, have been reported to take between 1 and 222 days to achieve their premorbid swallowing function as defined by reaching premorbid oral diet and fluids and no longer requiring the aid of supplementary nutrition, therapeutic or compensatory manoeuvres [14\u201316, 18, 20].",

However, no specific sub-analysis of those patients with or without inhalation injury was conducted to determine any differential patterns of dysphagia severity. Considering that increased dysphagia severity and duration to recovery has also been connected to other factors necessary to managing inhalation injury, including endotracheal tube size and duration of intubation and tracheostomy [11, 13, 24\u201327], it is possible that dysphagia severity in this cohort will be even higher than in the head and neck burn population. The application of enteral feeding following burn injury is also necessary, not only as an adjunct to managing nutritional sequelae associated with dysphagia alone but also to ensure adequate nourishment to facilitate wound healing, physical and psychological rehabilitation [28]. Duration of enteral feeding in the general thermal burns population has been shown to be lengthy and often extends beyond the time that dysphagia has resolved [14\u201316, 23]. Again, there is high probability this also will be protracted in those with concomitant inhalation injury.",

Consequently, the literature to date clearly describes that dysphagia is a considerable issue with substantial contribution to the burden of treatment for a patient with thermal burn injury. Although data detailing the presentation and clinical progression of dysphagia for the general burn population are developing, and predictive factors including inhalation injury have been identified, clinical details regarding the incidence and clinical progression in the subset of patients who also present with inhalation injury are lacking. The aim of this study was therefore, to determine the incidence of dysphagia and describe the clinical profile of swallowing function for those admitted with inhalation burn injury, and contrast this with known patterns of recovery for those without inhalation injury post burn.",

The hyolaryngeal complex was palpated during each swallow and where feasible (considering skin integrity, etc.) and concurrent cervical auscultation was used as supplemental information to help inform the final clinical decision regarding swallow integrity. Appropriate diet and fluid consistencies along with other compensatory and therapeutic manoeuvres were recommended with the aim to rehabilitate swallowing function, minimise aspiration risk as well as maximise nutritional input. Clinical outcomes of the assessment were reported using the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS).

However, the proportion of head and neck burns (100% Inhal_1 vs 26.2% Non-Inhal; p < 0.0001) and rate of tracheostomy insertion (18.42% Inhal_1 vs 0.49%; Non-Inhal; p < 0.0001) were both significantly greater for those with inhalation injury. Furthermore, the inhalation cohort had a higher percentage TBSA burn (p = 0.000), longer duration of endotracheal intubation (p = 0.000), as well as greater hospital (p = 0.000) and ICU LOS (p = 0.000) than their non-inhalation injury counterparts.",

A prospective study of burn patients that includes set time points at which patients could complete a full battery of outcome measures pertaining to swallowing would be beneficial to fully appreciate the specifics regarding patterns of dysphagia recovery and presence of long-term laryngotracheal dysfunction. The small sample size is also a potential issue due to the known high level of heterogeneity in the clinical burn population. As this was a single Statewide service study, the need to involve multi-site data sets from other Statewide services to produce a more robust sample is recognised. However, given that characteristics of the current inhalation cohort did not differ significantly on most parameters from those with inhalation injury reported by Rumbach et al. [14], which was set in a separate Statewide service within the same country, the authors believe that patterns reported here are potentially true indications of the nature of recovery post inhalation burn injury.",

The authors fully acknowledge that a CSE does not provide the diagnostic information as available from instrumental assessments such as FEES or videofluoroscopy. Recognising the issues associated with a CSE, it is accepted that sub-clinical symptoms of dysphagia may have been missed, or severity of dysphagia not fully appreciated. As such the data presented within this study may be in fact an under-representation of the true incidence and severity of dysphagia. Future prospective studies incorporating regular instrumental assessment are needed to fully understand the influence of damage to the pharyngeal and laryngeal structures on swallow function. The authors also accept that there is debate regarding the added benefit of including cervical auscultation in the CSE and its value in informing on swallow integrity [39]. Auscultation was simply used in this study as an adjunct measure to add to the clinical information being collected on each patient and its limitations are acknowledged. The FOIS scale also has known limitations when applied in this population due to the long-term dependence of many patients on non-oral feeding for reasons other than dysphagia. However, the absence of population specific/sensitive tools limits choice of outcome measures at present.",
