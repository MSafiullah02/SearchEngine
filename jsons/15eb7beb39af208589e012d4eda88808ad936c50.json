            "text": "Viral respiratory infections are the most common cause of an acute asthma exacerbation in both children and adults and represent a significant global health burden. An increasing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that these infections cause a greater degree of morbidity in asthmatic subjects than in the healthy population, emphasizing a discrepancy in the antiviral response of asthmatics. In this review we discuss why such a discrepancy might exist, examining the role of the bronchial epithelium as well as the main inflammatory cells, mediators, and molecular pathways that are involved in the immune response. In addition, the potential impact of virus-induced asthma exacerbations on airway remodelling is reviewed and we explore which therapeutic options might be of benefit in preventing the deterioration of asthma control seen following viral infection. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2010; 125:1178-87.) Key words: Asthma, acute exacerbation, virus Viral respiratory tract infections are one of the most common illnesses in human subjects, with 500 million cases and an economic burden estimated at $40 billion annually in the United States alone. 1 Since the early 1970s, viral respiratory tract infections have been reported as triggers for exacerbations of asthma in both adults and children. 2, 3 The development of highly sensitive and specific molecular diagnostic and detection techniques in the 1990s led to greatly improved detection of respiratory tract viruses and allowed clear demonstration of the important link between viral infections and asthma exacerbations. When RT-PCR is used to supplement or instead of conventional culture techniques, viruses have been found in approximately 80% of wheezing episodes in school-aged children and in approximately one half to three quarters of the acute wheezing episodes in adults. Of the respiratory tract viruses identified in these circumstances, rhinoviruses are most commonly found and are detected approximately 65% of the time. [4] [5] [6] [7] In addition to rhinoviruses, other respiratory tract viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses, coronaviruses, human metapneumoviruses, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, and bocaviruses, have all been detected in subjects with asthma exacerbations. However, in a recent epidemiologic study performed after the discovery of several newer viruses, such as bocavirus, the only virus type significantly associated with asthma exacerbations in children aged 2 to 17 years were rhinoviruses. 8 Understanding the mechanisms provoking virus-induced airway inflammation in asthmatic subjects might offer significant opportunities for improved disease management. The reality at present is that current drugs for the treatment of virus-induced exacerbations of asthma are poorly effective, and alternative therapies to modulate viral pathogenesis are desperately needed. Experimental human 9 and murine 10 models of rhinovirusinduced asthma exacerbations have recently been developed, and these offer great potential in increasing our understanding, with the goal of arriving at novel therapies in the future. In a recent study of this kind, experimental infection of both asthmatic and healthy volunteers with rhinovirus led to increased lower respiratory tract symptoms typical of a mild exacerbation in asthmatic subjects with only minimal lower respiratory tract symptoms in healthy volunteers. Increases in airway hyperresponsiveness and decreases in both peak expiratory flow and FEV 1 were demonstrated in asthmatic subjects without any change in these measures in healthy subjects. 9 This study, along with several others, supports the idea that respiratory tract viral infections cause a greater degree of morbidity in asthmatic subjects than in the healthy population. In this review we discuss why such a discrepancy in antiviral immune response might exist. In addition, we explore which therapeutic options might be of benefit in preventing the deterioration of asthma control seen after viral infection.",

Although rhinovirus induction of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and CCL5 was not different between the 2 groups, asthmatic BECs produced lower levels of the type I IFN-b and also had higher levels of rhinovirus replication. Importantly, deficient IFN-b expression was observed in both steroid-treated and steroid-naive asthmatic subjects. The asthmatic BECs responded to exogenous treatment with IFN-b, exhibiting reduced rhinovirus release and demonstrating that the deficiency in asthmatic cells was associated with production of antiviral IFN-b rather than the actions of IFN-b.",

Because asthmatic subjects have deficient IFN-b, IFN-l, and perhaps some of the IFN-as, 24 it is less likely a result of a polymorphism in one of these genes or their promoters. A polymorphism in a gene encoding a transcription factor or signaling molecule required for the expression of all these interferons is a more likely possibility, however. 25 Interestingly, Thomas et al 26 recently demonstrated that excess TGF-b present in asthmatic airways mediates enhanced rhinovirus replication, probably through its suppressive actions on host type I interferon responses. Specifically, the effect of TGF-b appeared to be mediated through actions on interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3 pathways. 26 ",

They also modulate the immune response by inhibiting antigen presentation by dendritic cells, T-cell activation, and B-cell antibody production. 27, 28 The interaction between rhinoviruses and macrophages stimulates secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-8, IFN-g, and CCL3/macrophage inflammatory protein 1a. In addition, TNF-a, a highly inflammatory cytokine, is produced by macrophages in response to rhinovirus, and this has been shown to require viral replication. 29 Rhinovirus infection also induces release of type I interferons from airway macrophages, a process that might limit viral spread by inducing an antiviral state in epithelial cells. 29 More recently, Oliver et al 30 identified virus-induced impairment of antibacterial host defense in human alveolar macrophages, suggesting viral infection might alter this function to facilitate additional bacterial infection.",

Studies have since demonstrated that numbers of neutrophils correlate with levels of IL-8 after rhinovirus infection, 33, 35 and IL-8 levels in nasal lavage correlates with the degree of airway responsiveness in asthmatic subjects. 36 This is in contrast to healthy subjects, in whom IL-8 levels were not found to be significantly increased. 37 Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor levels are also increased in nasal lavage fluid and sputum and later in the circulation after rhinovirus infection. Increased concentrations of circulatory granulocyte colony-stimulating factor could in turn act on the bone marrow to increase circulating neutrophil counts. 38, 39 Using a murine model of human rhinovirus infection, Nagarkar et al 40 recently showed that CXCR2, the receptor for ELR-positive CXC chemokines, is required for rhinovirus-induced neutrophilic airway inflammation and that neutrophil TNF-a release is required for airway hyperresponsiveness. Products of neutrophil activation could also cause airway obstruction through the production of elastase, which upregulates goblet cell mucus secretion. 41 In combination, these data suggest that rhinovirus infection of airway epithelial cells might potentiate pre-existing inflammation by enhancing the production of neutrophil chemoattractants and neutrophilic airway inflammation.",

Eosinophil granule proteins have been detected in nasal secretions of asthmatic children with wheezing illness caused by rhinovirus or RSV. [42] [43] [44] In these children levels of CCL5/RANTES, a potent chemotactic cytokine and activator of eosinophils, were also significantly increased. 44 After experimental rhinovirus infection, bronchial eosinophil infiltration has been observed in both healthy and asthmatic adults. However, in asthmatic subjects the eosinophil infiltrate was more prolonged and still present 6 to 8 weeks after infection. 45 In adults with allergic rhinitis, experimental rhinovirus infection increased allergen-induced eosinophil numbers in BAL fluid, 46 and in asthmatic adults eosinophil products were increased in sputum. 32 In addition, airway hyperresponsiveness correlated with rhinovirus-induced eosinophils, as reflected by an increase in eosinophilic cationic protein in sputum supernatants. 32 In vitro experiments indicate that rhinoviruses do not activate eosinophils directly 47 but rather probably through the activity of virus-induced mediators, adhesion molecules, 48, 49 or cytokines secreted by T cells, epithelial cells, or other airway cells. 50 It remains unclear, however, whether eosinophils contribute to host defense or to the immunopathology observed after viral infection. In a murine model of RSV infection, increased numbers of eosinophils improved viral clearance and reduced airway dysfunction, suggesting that eosinophils might be protective. 51",

Indeed, a recent proteomic analysis identified 191 different proteins in human induced sputum. 53 In asthmatic subjects the major mucin components of airway mucus secretions are MUC5AC and MUC5B, which contribute to the viscoelastic properties of the mucus. 54 He et al 55 56 have recently demonstrated that rhinovirus induces mucin production in epithelial cells and that this depends on viral replication and at least partly on Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3, a PRR that specifically recognizes viral double-stranded RNA. Hewson et al 57 have recently shown that rhinovirus induction of MUC5AC in BECs occurred through nuclear factor (NF) kB-dependent induction of matrix metalloproteinase-mediated TGF-a release. This activates an epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent cascade culminating in specificity protein 1 transactivation of the MUC5AC promoter. After experimental infection with rhinovirus-16, Hewson et al 57 also demonstrated increased MUC5AC production in healthy and asthmatic volunteers in vivo. This was related to viral load in asthmatic subjects but not healthy volunteers.",

TLR7, TLR8, and TLR3 are particularly relevant in relation to RNA viruses because they recognize and respond to single-stranded viral RNA and double-stranded viral RNA, respectively. TLR3 recognizes rhinovirus and is upregulated on infection. Blocking TLR3 suppresses antiviral responses, and rhinovirus replication and release is increased. 59 Roponen et al 66 recently demonstrated impaired TLR7 function in adolescents with mild-to-moderate asthma; however, the ability of a TLR3 ligand to induce key antiviral molecules was similar in asthmatic and control groups. Moreover, polymorphisms of TLR7 and TLR8 have been shown to be associated with asthma, identifying TLR7 and TLR8 as novel risk genes in subjects with asthma and related disorders. 67 ",

These observations support an important role for rhinovirus-induced lower airway inflammation in precipitating asthma exacerbations, perhaps through impaired T H 1/IL-10 and augmented T H 2 responses. 9 Epithelial cells infected with rhinovirus secrete CCL5 and CXCL10, which both promote T-cell chemotaxis. 69 Levels of CXCL10, a chemokine that binds to CXCR3, are increased in virus-induced asthma exacerbations. Indeed, it can distinguish virus-induced from non-virus-induced exacerbations. 69 A defective T H 1 response has also been implicated in RSVinduced bronchiolitis. Children with a deficient T H 1 and a relatively increased T H 2 immune response after RSV infection had better viral clearance and were more likely to have acute bronchiolitis than those with stronger type 1 responses who had milder illness without bronchiolitis. 70 In addition, other studies have demonstrated that those children with a relatively increased T H 2 cytokine profile during RSV-induced bronchiolitis were at increased risk of wheezing during follow-up. 71 ",

            "text": "The host response to infection is in part genetically programmed. In recent years, a large number of genetic polymorphisms relevant to both infection and asthma have been identified. These include several polymorphisms of PRRs, such as TLRs (see earlier), which have been shown to be associated with both infection severity and asthma. In addition, genes involved in regulating interferon production have been identified. The transcription factor IRF1 is centrally important to regulating IFN-g production and function. The IRF1 gene is located on chromosome 5q31 in the T H 2 cytokine cluster involved in the development of allergic disease, and almost 50 polymorphisms of the IRF1 locus have been analyzed. Eleven are significantly associated with atopy, total IgE levels, or specific IgE levels. 92 In addition, suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) regulates IFN-g signaling and antiviral responses, and a significant association between a polymorphism in the SOCS1 promoter and adult asthma has been observed. This polymorphism resulted in increased production of SOCS1 protein, which in turn inhibited phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 in response to IFN-b stimulation. 93 In addition to the genes involved in the innate/T H 1 response to infection and the associated risk of asthma, single nucleotide polymorphisms in T H 2-associated genes are also potentially important. Forton et al 94 recently identified a haplotype within the IL13-IL4 gene locus conferring an increased risk of severe primary RSV-induced bronchiolitis in early infancy. 94 It is likely that as technology continues to improve, future studies will reveal numerous other polymorphisms playing a key role in the asthmatic immune response to viral infection.",

            "text": "The central role that the bronchial epithelium plays in asthma is well appreciated, but what remains less clear is what effect viral infection of the asthmatic airway has on the chronic inflammatory response. Specifically, is there a lasting effect that might lead to airway wall remodeling and worsening of fixed airflow obstruction? J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 125, NUMBER 6 Leigh et al 95 recently demonstrated that rhinovirus infection of cultured epithelial cells led to upregulation of amphiregulin, activin A, and VEGF protein levels. These 3 mediators have all been strongly implicated in the remodeling process. Amphiregulin, a member of the epidermal growth factor family, is released in response to airway epithelial injury and engages epidermal growth factor receptors to drive the altered repair process that is characteristic of airway remodeling. 96 Activin A is a member of the TGF-b superfamily and has been implicated in the subepithelial fibrosis characteristic of airway remodeling. 97, 98 Expression of VEGF and its receptors is increased in asthmatic subjects, and VEGF is the major proangiogenic activator in asthmatic airways. 99, 100 Increases in the size and number of airway wall blood vessels are characteristic of airway remodeling, even in subjects with mild asthma, 101 and overexpression of VEGF in the airways of mice has been shown to result in both vascular and airway remodeling. 102 Moreover, nasal lavage samples from subjects with confirmed natural rhinovirus infections showed significantly higher VEGF protein levels during peak cold symptoms compared with both baseline levels and control levels. 95 Although epithelial cells are the main target for rhinovirus infection, studies have indicated that rhinovirus might be detected in the subepithelial layer by means of in situ hybridization 103, 104 and that human lung fibroblasts are susceptible to rhinovirus infection. 105 It is possible that rhinovirus gains access to underlying fibroblasts through the epithelial disruption that occurs in asthmatic airways. This susceptibility might then allow rhinovirus replication in the lower airways to develop, especially in asthmatic subjects in whom there is reduced protection offered by epithelially derived interferons. Bedke et al 106 recently infected normal and asthmatic airway fibroblasts in vitro with rhinovirus-1B, illustrating both the ability of fibroblasts to support viral replication and their vigorous proinflammatory response with induction of IL-6 and IL-8. This latter response compounds the existing airway inflammation to contribute to an exacerbation. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that exogenous IFN-b protects fibroblasts against infection, providing further support for its potential use as a therapy against virus-induced asthma exacerbations.",

Pleconaril, an antiviral drug against picornavirus infection, is currently being studied in subjects with asthma exacerbations. It blocks uncoating and attachment by binding into a hydrophobic pocket within the capsid. Other similar drugs are also in active development.",

These studies showed a dose-dependent improvement in symptom scores and reduced viral shedding, but side effects were again a problem. [131] [132] [133] An approach using interferon aims at boosting host defense rather than targeting specific respiratory viruses. This is a significant advantage over specific antiviral approaches because it would treat all virus-induced asthma attacks rather than just those caused by a specific virus. Despite the problems with side effects in the early trials, there are sufficient in vitro and in vivo data supporting a re-examination of this treatment approach.
