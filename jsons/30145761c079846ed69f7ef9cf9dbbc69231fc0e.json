We also note that our analysis is based on completed EMAs for each individual and does not account for missed surveys. The survey response rate dropped in the week post declaration of emergency compared to previous weeks (75% response rate to 65% response rate), so it is possible that the participants most affected by the crisis are self-censoring 16 . Furthermore, as we only look at short-term effects of the coronavirus crisis, these findings may change as time goes on. We will continue monitoring the longer-term response to the crisis and will report on trends as they emerge. Although it remains to be seen how individuals respond as the coronavirus crisis progresses, these findings suggest that at the population level and on a short time scale, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased stress levels widely, but has not had a uniform impact on mental health.

These dates straddle the most prominent government-mandated disruptions with the national declaration of emergency (3/13) and the White House recommendation limiting gatherings (3/16) . Daily measurements of semantic location, EMAs, and PHQ were averaged within each week of analysis. Weekend and weekday averages for individuals were calculated over all weeks of our study up through 3/9/20, to align with the last EMA period before coronavirus-related disruptions. The paired values for every individual who had at least one reading in both study periods were used for our t-test, which was 120 participants for location sensors, 127 participants for EMAs, and 113 participants for PHQ-8 surveys. Complete hypothesis testing information can be found in Table 2 . Summary statistics on PHQ-8 surveys among participants who recently experienced job loss can be found in Table 3 .",
