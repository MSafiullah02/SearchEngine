The infants were recruited between the first and third days of life. The inclusion criteria were as follows: gestational age between 32 + 0 and 36 + 6 weeks, birth weight of greater than 1500 g, and absence of any congenital defects preventing enteral nutrition. The standard of care in our unit is to give either maternal or pasteurized donated breast milk to all preterm infants. The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki, as revised in 2000. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents of the infants, and the study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital District of South-West Finland. The major challenge in this trial was the recruitment of patients. In Finland the use of commercially available probiotic products, even among newborns, is highly widespread, and most of the parents recruited did not want to participate in the study because they wanted to give their infant probiotics.",

Additionally, adverse events were queried from the parents during all visits. These data will be published in detail elsewhere.6 Furthermore, parents kept a structured diary on the child's physician's office visits and pharmacologic treatments during the follow-up period. The information was collected from the diaries, as well as from the parents, during the study visits.

The study had several outcome variables. The present article describes the effect of prebiotic and probiotic intervention on the incidence of RTIs. Data were analyzed based on complete case analysis. Categorical variables were analyzed by using the \u03c72 test and the Fisher exact test for dichotomous variables. Univariate associations between continuous variables were analyzed by using ANOVA or the Kruskall-Wallis test. Negative binomial regression was used to compare the incidence of RTIs or rhinovirus infections among the study groups. The results are given as rate ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs. In addition, this association was studied by using antenatal steroids, delivery method, sex, postnatal antibiotics, and older siblings at home as covariates. Because the same child could have multiple viral episodes, the following analyses were made with repeated-measures methods. Viral copy numbers were compared between the study groups by using nonparametric repeated-measures analysis. Comparisons between groups were made by using generalized estimating equations for the duration and intensity of clinical symptoms. Associations between the area under the curve of viral copy numbers and duration and severity of symptoms were studied by using mixed models.",

Our results support previously published randomized, double-blind prebiotic and/or probiotic trials conducted in healthy term infants during the first year of life, with the incidence of clinical RTIs representing outcome (Table V\n),10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and extend these to an objective characterization of the viral cause. In contrast to earlier studies, this study was conducted in premature infants, and supplementation commenced within the first week of life, which might have increased the protective efficacy against RTIs. Moreover, the effect exerted by prebiotics tended to outweigh that of the probiotic. One putative explanation for this finding might lie in the pre-existence of bifidobacteria-dominated gut microbiota in our breast-fed preterm population,6 which strengthens the effect of prebiotics in selective stimulation of the growth of beneficial intestinal microorganisms.2\n",

Although both prebiotic and probiotic supplementation prevented rhinovirus infections, the intervention had no effect on the duration or severity of symptomatic rhinovirus infections.

On the other hand, our study is the first to report the effect of prebiotics and probiotics on the prevention of defined viral RTIs in a preterm cohort. The results enhance the placebo-controlled evidence noted in several reviews (also the Cochrane review),3, 4, 37 especially data for infancy. Our study also provides novel clinical evidence as to rhinovirus RNA shedding and its relation to the clinical picture in symptomatic and asymptomatic infants.

RTIs are a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, particularly during the first years of life, with rhinovirus being the main pathogen responsible for this socioeconomic burden. Although strict hygiene measures have been shown to reduce viral transmission and thus diminish the incidence of rhinovirus infections, no definitive preventive measures have thus far been discovered for the effective control of this entity. On the basis of our results, gut microbiota modulation with specific prebiotics, probiotics, or both could offer a cost-effective tool in the fight against RTIs, hopefully also in the developing world.",
