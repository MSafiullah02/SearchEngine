For pressurized aircraft flying at these levels, the conditioned air entering the cabin has a relative humidity of <1%.

A novel strain of influenza A H1N1, so-called \u201cswine flu,\u201d emerged from a pig farm in central Mexico in 2009 and eventually caused over 200,000 deaths worldwide within the first year the virus circulated.22 Although air travel was strongly associated with the importation of cases to other countries, actual transmission during air travel, though often suspected, was difficult to document.23, 24, 25 An investigation by the CDC among passengers who flew on four North American flights in April 2009 with individuals who were ill with laboratory-confirmed H1N1 showed low risk of in-flight transmission to passengers and crew. In-flight transmission of the new virus is unlikely in flights of relatively short duration, although longer intercontinental flights may pose a greater risk of transmission. Offering symptomatic passengers medical care upon arrival at airport checkpoints may be an effective way to screen for influenza, and is likely to be more cost effective than exit and entry screening, quarantine, and travel restrictions.26 The simplest, most effective, and least costly control measures involve the individual behaviors of travelers and of their health care providers.27\n",
