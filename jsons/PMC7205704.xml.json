The American Board of Anesthesiology first offered certification in critical care in 1986.1 This development followed an unsuccessful attempt to create a unified board certification process for all critical care physicians from various backgrounds including anesthesiology, internal medicine, pediatrics, and surgery.1\n,\n2 Since this introduction of board certification, the particpiation of anesthesiologists in critical care has not kept pace with other specialists from emergency medicine, internal medicine, and surgery who have expanded their role in adult critical care including cardiothoracic critical care:.1, 2, 3 This lack of growth prompted concerns about the future of anesthesiologists in critical care both in the 1990\u2019s and early in the new millenium.1\n;\n3 It is likley that the participation of anesthesiologists in critical care throughout the United States continues to be highly variable depending on multiple factors including gender, opportunities and location.4, 5, 6\n",

In this survey, greater than 75% (23/30) of respondents noted that a critical care anesthesiologist held a system-wide leadership position at their respective institutions. These positions included chief operating officer, senior vice president, and chair for critical care medicine in their respective hospitals. Furthermore, all respondents viewed having an anesthesiology presence within adult critical care medicine as positive. Respondents were mixed upon the financial implications of anesthesiologists practicing critical care with 23.3% (7/30) stating that it required additional financial support, 30% (9/30) stating that it garnered additional revenue, and 46.7% (14/30) having a neutral position. Upon completion of the survey, respondents also described their vision for critical care within anesthesiology. From a total of 23 free text responses, 5 major themes could be defined as follows: further encouragement of resident interest; greater expansion into cardiothoracic critical care; the importance of critical care to the future of anesthesiology; the priority for greater support and recognition; and boosted ownership in critical care medicine by anesthesiologists (refer to Table 1\n). Notably, a major themes is the ongoing expansion of critical care anesthesiologists into cardiothoracic critical care with concomitant integration of extracorporeal membrane oxygentation into the practice of perioperative medicine.14, 15\n",

The response to the crisis will likely grow the roles of anesthesiologists in critical care, including the cardiothoracic arena. It will remain important to harmonize this growth with developments in the critical care landscape, including calls for refined training certification requirements.21 Furthermore, there are also opportunities for adult cardiothoracic anesthesiology to learn from the European experience in fellowship development as the evolution in this subspecialty continues.22 The challenges ahead for fellowships in adult cardiothoracic anesthesiology include board certification and better integration with cardiothoracic critical care.23, 24 This dynamic interface between cardiothoracic anesthesiology and critical care offers multiple opportunities for both subspecialites to harmonize, to thrive and to strengthen their clinical impact and delivered value.",
