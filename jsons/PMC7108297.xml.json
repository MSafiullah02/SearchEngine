            "text": "The B cell activating factor from the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family (BAFF; also known as BLyS, TNFSF13B) system has been extensively reviewed since its discovery in 1999 [1], [2], particularly in the field of autoimmunity, where BAFF has a crucial role, especially in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (reviewed in Vincent et al. [3]). The role of BAFF on B-lymphocytes and in autoimmunity, and the resulting clinical success in SLE patients, have almost overshadowed the potential role of this system in other immunological fields, such as transplantation/graft versus host disease (GVHD), chronic variable immunodeficiency (CVID), infections and allergy. For instance, BAFF is emerging as a critical factor in various hematological and lymphoid cancers. Indeed, a number of translational studies link progression of various malignancies with BAFF's well-described pro-survival activity, suggesting that the use of BAFF-neutralizing therapies may extend to additional indications, in particular cancer. Furthermore, the BAFF system has recently been described in preeclampsia [4], and the data suggests that both BAFF and APRIL signaling pathways are important for cell viability in the human placenta [5]. This review details the latest results and views on novel functions of the BAFF/APRIL system outside of the autoimmunity arena. However, as the role of BAFF in autoimmunity remains one the most important developments in this decade, this review also provides an update on current clinical trials.",

            "text": "One of the most important paradigm shifts in B-lymphocyte biology in last fifteen years has been the realization that expression of a B cell receptor (BCR) on B cells was important but not enough for survival and maturation. Indeed, BAFF has emerged a critical B cell survival factor without which maturation of B cells does not occur [2]. A proliferation inducting ligand (APRIL; also known as TNFSF13A) was identified as a cell growth stimulator in various cancer cell lines [6]. BAFF and APRIL are produced as type II transmembrane proteins, like many of the TNF family ligands, and are then proteolytically cleaved at a furin protease site and released in a soluble form [7]. BAFF may remain in a membrane-bound form, although processed soluble BAFF is required for B cell homeostasis [8]. In contrast, APRIL is cleaved in the Golgi site prior to release, and normally exists in a soluble form only, once outside of the cell of origin [9]. A recently reported exception to this is APRIL-\u03b4, a malignant isoform of APRIL that lacks a furin cleavage site and remains membrane-bound on leukemia cell precursors [10]; another membrane-bound variation is TWE-PRIL (TNFSF12\u2013TNFSF13), which is a hybrid protein of APRIL and TWEAK (TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis, TNFSF12) resulting from trans-splicing between their adjacent genes [11]. BAFF is an active ligand as a homotrimer, which is the main form of BAFF found in the circulation [12], however, unlike other TNF family cytokines, a 60-mer form of BAFF has been obtained at physiological pH conditions and this form is also able to bind to its receptors [13], [14]. While this form has been described in mouse models, it remains unclear whether or not it can be detected in humans. Mouse BAFF also has a membrane-bound splice variant, \u03b4-BAFF, which may form trimers with normal BAFF proteins to reduce BAFF availability, although both forms of BAFF modulate B-1 B cell populations [15]. APRIL, but not BAFF can interact with heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) [16], which are structurally unrelated to TNF receptors, but may act to increase APRIL signaling at a local site and concentrate APRIL on the cell surface, similar to the 60-mer form of BAFF engaging many receptors at a single site (see Fig. 1\n).",

            "text": "BAFF and APRIL share two receptors: transmembrane activator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI; also known as TNFRSF13B) and B cell maturation antigen (BCMA; also known as TNFRSF17). APRIL binds strongly to BCMA and moderately to TACI, whereas BAFF binds weakly to BCMA and strongly to TACI [17]. Additionally, BAFF binds strongly to BAFF receptor (BAFF-R; also known as TNFRSF13C) [17]. These three main receptors, BAFF-R, TACI, and BCMA have distinct expression patterns based on B cell development stages, related to their separate functions (Table 1\n). BAFF-R expression is absent on B cell precursors in the bone marrow but is gained on immature B cells upon acquiring a functional B cell receptor (BCR) [18], and BAFF-R is critical for survival and maturation of immature B cells [19]. In mice, TACI is expressed most highly on mature innate-like B cells such as marginal zone (MZ) B cells and B-1 B cells, and is necessary for T-independent type II and type I responses [20], [21], negative regulation of B cell numbers [22] and T follicular helper (Tfh) cell numbers [23], and promotion of class switch recombination in B cells by signaling directly through myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) [24]. TACI expression is temporally regulated, such that TACI expression is decreased in newborn humans and mice [25]. In humans, TACI is expressed on memory B cells and TACI mutations are detected in up to 10% of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) patients making it the most frequently mutated gene for that disease [26], [27]. TACI can interact with APRIL and HSPG in a complex [28]. BCMA expression is restricted to plasmablasts and plasma cells (PC) [29], and BCMA promotes long-lived PC survival [30], [31].",

BAFF expression is upregulated by estrogen [35], which is consistent with the strong gender bias observed in BAFF-driven autoimmune patients and some murine disease models. BAFF expression is increased by interferon-alpha (IFN-\u03b1) signaling [35], and B cell-deficient, BAFF-deficient mice were protected from IFN-\u03b1-driven systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [36], reinforcing the potential for BAFF-overexpression as a driver of autoimmune disease, also supported by a correlation between elevated circulating BAFF levels and SLE in humans (reviewed in Vincent et al.

Furthermore, BAFF levels have also been used to delineate kidney transplant recipients with normal or abnormal renal function and rejection.

Na\u00efve B cell lymphopenia was also correlated with hypogammaglobulinemia and coincident increases in CD38hi B cells [43]. This is in contrast to autologous HSCT in which there is a drastic increase in the number of na\u00efve and transitional B cells following transplantation, possibly suggesting competitive reconstitution of na\u00efve B cells. Depletion of activated and potentially autoreactive B cells has been suggested, using rituximab [44]. Further studies have shown stably induced changes in B cell distribution 25 months after rituximab therapy, with notable increases in na\u00efve IgD+ B cell numbers and decreased activated BAFF-Rlo CD20lo B cells. Interestingly, however, BAFF levels, often seen as negative prognostic factors, increased after rituximab treatment [45], potentially due to diminished numbers of BAFF receptor-expressing B cells or as a feedback loop response to the loss of B cells [3]. While the sentiment remains that BAFF is a viable therapeutic target, the glaring disconnect between increased serum BAFF and poor reconstitution of na\u00efve B cells, which have higher BAFF-R expression than activated B cells including CD27+ B cells, suggests that other mechanisms are at work. If na\u00efve B cell expansion is necessary for redistribution of B cells, BAFF modulation may not be a simple therapy and inhibition of TACI and/or BCMA may be more appropriate for targeting CD27+ GC and post-GC B cells.",

This latter study provides a rationale for future studies that will include assessment of BAFF receptor phenotype in disease context to more fully understand disease dynamics and how BAFF may polarize cellular behavior. Indeed, investigations of cellular programming of B cell tumors, led to the identification of a novel BAFF splice variant, aptly named \u03944BAFF. The isoform has an exaggerated production in SLE and CLL thereby enhancing autocrine BAFF secretion at the transcriptional level and, as such, acting as a transcription factor. This is the first report of cytokine self-regulation at the transcriptional level and may be the first piece in an unexplored layer of BAFF regulation [54]. This provides some support for the aberrant autocrine feedback seen in these pathologies and suggests that pathogenic BAFF signals may be self-substantiating, with possible implications for future therapeutic strategies. Similarly, APRIL isoforms (\u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4, \u025b) were detected in pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells, potentially contributing to previously BAFF-attributed B cell survival [10].",

Surprisingly, soluble BCMA isoforms have been identified and while their function is not yet elucidated, it suggests the exciting prospect of natural decoys produced to regulate levels of free BAFF or APRIL [10]. Overexpression of TACI has been detected in multiple myeloma and thyroid carcinoma; and correlative analyses suggest that TACI expression is a useful prognostic marker for lymphoma [55]. Most interestingly, overexpression of APRIL was found to coincide with overexpression of HSPGs [55], which are known co-receptors for APRIL when binding TACI. This has renewed speculation that HSPGs may act as primary receptors for APRIL in addition to co-receptor function. BAFF-R has been implicated in nuclear interactions with IKK\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB/c-Rel in both normal health and neoplastic B cells, including NHL B cells, which enhance histone H3 phosphorylation and binding of NF-\u03baB on promoters for inducible genes including Bcl-xl, CD40L and most strikingly, BAFF. This complicates further an already complicated picture of BAFF system regulation, in which the receptor itself is a transcriptional regulator and exerts its effects via chromatin remodeling in addition to classical NF-\u03baB activation at the membrane surface [56].",

Merck's Phase Ib trial with atacicept inhibitor of BAFF and APRIL has shown that the agent is well tolerated at moderate dosage but currently no data on the clinical activity in CLL trials is available [58]. Competitive inhibition with a fusion protein comprising BAFF and the toxin gelonin has shown promising efficacy in promoting tumor clearance in childhood ALL when combined with mobilizing agents such as a CXCR4 antagonist [59]. A similar strategy employing mutant BAFF fused with Pin2/TRF1-interacting protein X1 (PinX1), a telomerase reverse transcriptase inhibitor, has also been effective at selectively killing BAFF receptor expressing Burkitt lymphoma lines [60]. The latter example further reinforces growing evidence that BAFF function is not confined to NF-\u03baB activation and pro-survival transcriptional activity but direct alteration at immunosenescence checkpoints of target cells at the chromatin-level to alter proliferative capacity and ultimately survival. These developments will preface development of a new generation of cancer therapeutics.",

In addition, cell lines infected in vitro with viruses including dengue virus, Sendai virus, reovirus-1 and Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) upregulate BAFF expression [64], [65], [66]. There are few examples of APRIL expression being assessed, however one study looking at coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis described up-regulated APRIL expression that was IFN-\u03b3 independent, and there are conflicting results following RSV infection [63], [67]. Many observations have noted that BAFF upregulation observed following viral infection is IFN-dependent, and monocytes have been shown to release BAFF in response to IFN treatment [7]. Indeed both Sendai virus infection of monocytes and RSV infection of bronchial epithelial cells (both ssRNA viruses) have been shown to be abrogated by blocking IFN signaling [63], [66]. The importance of IFN-signaling has been underlined by the Interprim ANRS 112 Study Group. This study shows that patients with acute HIV-1 infection that were treated with pegylated-IFN-alpha2b treatment in combination with antiretroviral therapy produced higher anti-HIV antibody titers with a broader specificity than patients treated with antiretroviral therapy alone [68]. This IFN treatment resulted in higher levels of BAFF, and the success of the treatment was attributed in part to increased BAFF signaling. Whether increasing BAFF alone (without increased IFN treatment) would have proved efficacious in this trial was not tested. Whether the upregulation of BAFF in viral infections is a product of inflammation, or a direct effect of viral infection from BAFF-producing cells, and whether BAFF is a necessary key to producing antiviral antibodies still remains to be determined.",

Macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells are capable of producing high amounts of BAFF, whilst epithelial cells lining mucosal layers have been shown to be able to more modestly upregulate BAFF secretion as a result of infection, none-the-less they are thought to play an important role in local responses [66]. Human and mouse B cells have been shown to upregulate BAFF and APRIL expression as a result of EBV infection, and some human EBV + B cells lines produced comparable levels of BAFF and APRIL to human myeloid cell lines tested (Table 1) [65]. Not only did the EBV-infected B cell lines express BAFF and APRIL, but they expressed BAFF-R, TACI and BCMA transcripts, thus infection by EBV resulted in engagement of BAFF-R/TACI/BCMA by autocrine BAFF and APRIL, which led to class switching, and NF-\u03baB activation. Thus, whilst BAFF and APRIL play an important role in containing the EBV infection, sustained BAFF and APRIL expression lead to inappropriate lymphoproliferation, underscoring the importance of limiting the expression of BAFF and APRIL to appropriate situations and timeframes. HIV-infected patients also suffer from B cell dysregulation that leads to lymphomas, and only 30\u201340% of these complications are EBV-related. It has been proposed that these lymphomas are a result of polyclonal B-cell activation caused by HIV-infected mDCs secreting BAFF, and other inflammatory cytokines in the vicinity of B cells expressing receptors for BAFF [69].",

This group showed the importance of the receptor TACI for the maintenance of anti-influenza responses, as TACI\u2212/\u2212 mice mounted antiviral responses that were comparable to WT up until 18 days, but by 33 days post-infection the antiviral titers in TACI\u2212/\u2212 mice had declined significantly.

Although the fact that there are also patients with TACI and BAFF-R mutations who are asymptomatic tells us that there are other genetic or environmental factors that contribute to this phenotype. However, mirroring the CVID patients with mutant TACI or BAFF-R, mice lacking TACI, or treated with TACI-Ig, and mice deficient in BAFF-R have deficient humoral immunity to T-cell independent antigens, including encapsulated bacterial pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae [73]. BAFF-R-deficient mice have almost no mature B cells, so it is not surprising that these mice have reduced antibody titers, however the TACI\u2212/\u2212 mice demonstrate the importance of TACI signaling in generating functional antibody responses, as these animal have B cells and in elevated numbers. The diminished capacity of neonates to mount protective responses to bacterial polysaccharides (and viruses) may be due to reduced expression of TACI, BCMA and BAFF-R on B cells, and thus a decreased ability to generate switched antibody responses [74], although neonates also express low levels of CD40.

Whilst the level of BAFF secreted locally by DCs has not been investigated in humans, systemic levels of BAFF increased with acute malarial infection (as did IFN-\u03b3), however, the level of BAFF-R on B cells was reduced during acute infection in humans [77], suggesting that defective BAFF signaling may be the key to the poor humoral responses despite frequent antigen exposure observed in malaria-endemic areas.",

Homozygosity for variants C104R, A181E and S144X of the TACI gene has been confirmed in a number of CVID patients [81], [72]. Heterozygosity for variants C104R, A181E, S194X and R202H has also been described in CVID patients [81], [72]. The most common variants are C104R affecting the extracellular domain and A181E located in the transmembrane domain, and for these, heterozygosity is more common than homozygosity. Work dissecting how the C104R mutation leads to impaired TACI function, first showed that this mutated form of TACI interferes with TACI signaling by associating with WT TACI in the absence of ligand, hence forming signaling-defective oligomeric receptor complexes [85]. Later work looking at the equivalent TACI mutation in mice (C76R) demonstrated that B cell function was impaired in mice heterozygous for the mutation suggesting that this mutation impairs TACI function in heterozygotes via haploinsufficiency [86], [87].",

Yet, relatives of a CVID patient can often carry the same TACI mutations without any immunological abnormalities [80], [26]. Interestingly, both B cells from CVID patients and healthy relatives are defective in vitro, in particular in response to TLR9 activation and TACI stimulation [26]. In contrast, in vitro IgG and IgA production from healthy relative-derived B cells was normal when compared to B cells from CVID relatives [26].

Indeed, BAFF-R variants, present at the heterozygous state, have been identified in CVID patients with low B cell numbers [90]. These variants appeared to be polymorphic as they do not affect BAFF-R expression, yet no signaling through these variants has been tested [90]. Another report described siblings carrying a homozygous BAFF-R gene deletion preventing BAFF-R protein expression [91]. Yet only one sibling had recurrent infections, the other remained relatively healthy. Both siblings had reduced B cell numbers as well as reduced IgM and IgG levels but IgA levels remained within a normal range [91]. TACI (which was not mutated in these patients) is critical for IgA production in mice [88], [89], which may explain this difference. Therefore, similar to individuals treated with B cell depleting agent belimumab, the incidence of infection in BAFF-R-null patients may vary from one individual to another depending on additional factors and/or exposure to pathogens [92]. For this reason, while defects in BAFF-R or TACI function will certainly increase an individual's vulnerability to immunodeficiency, additional factors are required to precipitate clear CVID clinical manifestations.",

However, the role of this system in airway inflammation still remains unclear and often controversial. Early work has looked at mouse models of airway inflammation and showed that mice over-expressing BAFF (BAFF Tg mice) were protected against airway inflammation compared to WT animals [93]. Yet, two independent studies looking at the use of a TACI-Ig decoy receptor to neutralize both BAFF and APRIL in the same mouse model, showed that it had a protective effect and protected the animals against airway inflammation [94], [95]. This mouse model of airway inflammation is driven by T-helper 2 (Th2) effector T cells and BAFF Tg produce higher numbers of regulatory T cells (Tregs) [96] which may have inhibited the function of Th2 cells in BAFF Tg mice. Alternatively, TACI-Ig also blocks APRIL, not just BAFF, and APRIL may play a role in this model. It does not seem to be the case as APRIL appears to block Th2 effector responses and APRIL\u2212/\u2212 mice are more susceptible to airway inflammation compared to WT animals [97].",

Moreover, segmental allergen challenge of allergic patients leads to local release of BAFF [99]. The same group also provided evidence that BAFF plays a role in the pathology of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps [100]. Work on a Korean cohort of children showed that levels of BAFF in the sputum are increased [101]. One study suggested that measuring serum BAFF levels may serve a novel diagnostic parameter for asthma [102], yet another study suggested that other factors such as stem cell factor (SCF) and IL-31 are more reliable indicators [103]. Interestingly, emerging work looking at TACI mutations in Swedish children with asthma described rare mutations in the TACI gene correlating with an increased risk of asthma symptoms [104]. None of these mutations affected IgA production [104]. In conclusion, the role of BAFF in human asthma remains unclear and more work needs to be done to ascertain the role of the BAFF/APRIL system in the function of IgE-producing B cells, mast cells, neutrophils, airway macrophages and DCs as well as the regulation of Th2 effector cells.",

Moreover, SLE-prone mice New-Zealand Black \u00d7 New-Zealand White (NZBxNZW)F1, BXSB and MRL-lpr/lpr mice have increased serum BAFF levels, and BAFF blockade led to reduced disease manifestations [105], [106]. Interestingly, BAFF appears to also play a central role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune arthritis. Serum BAFF levels were reportedly elevated in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model, an experimental model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [107]. Moreover, BAFF gene silencing in CIA mice abrogated autoimmune arthritis development [108]. Investigation of the role of APRIL in CIA led to conflicting results as CIA incidence was reported lower in both APRIL\u2212/\u2212 mice [109] and APRIL Tg mice [110]. In addition to the different genetic modifications in these two mice strains, the genetic background was also different. DBA1 mice [110] are autoimmune prone even without overexpression of APRIL, while the APRIL\u2212/\u2212 mice used were on a C57BL6 background. The exact role of APRIL in experimental RA remains to be clarified. Of note, CIA as well as adjuvant arthritis in rats, another experimental model of RA, experienced improvement in arthritis development after TACI-Ig administration which blocks both BAFF and APRIL [111], [112].",

Tabalumab already showed some early clinical efficiency in RA. However, in a recent randomized placebo-controlled trial (RCT), tabalumab did not meet primary endpoint at week 16 in RA patients with inadequate response to TNF inhibitors [117]. In another RCT in RA patients with inadequate response to MTX and na\u00efve to biologics, tabalumab met the primary endpoint at week 16 [118]. In these two studies, after an initial transient increase, there was a decrease in CD20+ B cells, as well as mature CD27\u2212IgD+ B cells, whereas CD27+IgD\u2212 memory B cells increased. Of note, a reduction in IgM and IgA (only in one study [117]) but not IgG levels in patients receiving tabalumab compared to placebo was observed [117], [118]. A recent uncontrolled open-label study showed that RA patients receiving tabalumab had a reduced total number of B cells, and specifically mature na\u00efve B cells, throughout the 52-week study period without reaching total depletion. Memory B cells rapidly increased at week 12 (almost 100%) and remained increased up to week 52 (70%). The median time for B cell recovery since the last subcutaneous injection was 40.6 weeks. Serum IgA, IgM, and IgG decreased at week 52. All B cells subset (and Ig) alterations were not associated with an increased rate of infection, highlighting the satisfactory safety profile of tabalumab [119]. A recent 52-week open-label extension study, following a RCT of 24 weeks, in RA patients receiving a stable dose of methotrexate (MTX) reported sustained long-term efficiency of the drug from week 24 to week 52 according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria. A high rate of infections in a dose-dependent manner was reported [120]. A Phase II study involving relapsing-remitting MS patients has recently been completed (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00882999), but no clinical data has been published so far.",

Of note, APRIL is implicated in PC survival and antibody production in both mice [31], [130], [30] and humans [131]. In mice and monkeys, atacicept reduces serum IgM levels and inhibits the IgM response to T-dependent antigen [132]. Data in mice showed that TACI-Ig inhibits B cell maturation and survival, T cell activation, and the T cell independent MZ B cell response. In a mouse model, TACI-Ig also significantly decreases PC numbers in the spleen and BM [132], [133], [134]. However, TACI-Ig treatment does not reduce the numbers of mouse memory B cells, which are active in long-term humoral immunity, as their survival is independent of BAFF or APRIL [130]. These biologic changes in response to TACI-Ig are associated with reduced disease scores and prolonged survival in SLE-prone mice [105], [133], [134], [135]. In two Phase Ib studies, atacicept treatment showed a safety profile and reduced serum IgM, IgA and IgG levels, as well as reduced mature and total B cell numbers in a dose-related manner in SLE patients [136], [137]. Of note, promising effects on disease-activity measures were reported [136], [137]. Unfortunately, a RCT Phase II/III trial with concomitant newly initiated corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in active lupus nephritis (LN) was stopped due to increased rates of infections and a pronounced decline in serum IgG levels [138]. It is important to note that the reduction in serum IgG levels started after initiation of MMF and corticosteroids, namely two weeks before atacicept induction. Interestingly, while SLE patients with significant kidney disease or severe renal disorder were excluded from the two previous Phase Ib studies [136], [137], the four SLE patients receiving atacicept in the Phase II/III study were characterized by active LN with high levels of proteinuria that may have disrupted IgG excretion as well as drug pharmacokinetics [138]. Another Phase II/III study involving lupus patients, without both active CNS SLE and active moderate to severe glomerulonephritis, has just been completed (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00624338) but no published data is available. Strikingly, disease activity worsened in MS patients receiving atacicept in a Phase II clinical trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00642902), leading to termination of the latter as well as two other clinical trials, one in MS (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00853762) and one in optic neuritis (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00624468). In RA, atacicept did not meet primary efficacy end point in two Phase II clinical trials, despite an acceptable safety profile and significant biological activity, which were previously reported in a Phase Ib study in RA patients [139], [140], [141]. A recent Phase II RCT clinical trial studying the effect of atacicept in combination with rituximab (RTX) in RA patients reported more hypersensitivity-related events in atacicept-RTX combination group compared to RTX monotherapy. There were no differences regarding clinical response or infection rates between these two groups [142].",

            "text": "The production of antidrug antibodies (ADAb) in chronic inflammatory disease has been shown to limit both the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibodies neutralizing TNF, thereby influencing disease activity. In fact, ADAb formation is associated with lower serum TNF inhibitor drug levels, adverse events and drug failure in these diseases. The use of immunosuppressive agents in combination with TNF inhibitors appears to reduce the incidence of antibody formation against the drug, as prevalence of ADAb is inversely associated with dose and additional use of MTX in chronic inflammatory disease such as RA (reviewed in Vincent et al. [143]). Thus, ADAb could possibly explain in part the failure of anti-BAFF therapy in some patients, especially those not receiving immunosuppressants as demonstrated in studies involving anti-TNF drugs [143], as well as rituximab, where a correlation between the presence of ADAb, weak B cell depletion and clinical outcomes has been noted [144]. Of note, the reported frequency of anti-tabalumab antibodies in RA patients ranged from 0 to 4.4% [117], [118], [120]. In a recent study, in which 3% (3/100) of RA patients had anti-tabalumab ADAb [118], authors reported no association with drug failure or adverse events associated with ADAb, however this is a very small sample size preventing any definitive conclusion on this issue. Whether there are ADAb toward all anti-BAFF drugs is unknown, and whether potential ADAb will limit drug efficiency remains to be determined.",

But like many ligands in the TNF superfamily, BAFF and APRIL most likely have beneficial as well as detrimental effects. The dominant effect will determine how to target this system effectively in pathologies other than autoimmunity and more work is needed to better understand emerging roles of the BAFF system in additional immunological settings. While BAFF inhibitors continue to show some degrees of efficacy in many ongoing clinical trials, the challenge will always be to obtain significantly added benefits of this approach compared to currently used biologics.

BAFF trimers do not activate TACI efficiently and BAFF multimers are required for this. BAFF has also recently been described to bind to a receptor on astrocytes and neurons called Nogo-66 receptor (NgR). APRIL is cleaved intracellularly (with the exception of APRIL-\u03b4), and is found in the circulation as a trimer, and as a multimer in association with heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). APRIL binds strongly to BCMA, weakly to TACI, which also binds to HSPGs. BAFF-R is primarily expressed on all B cells, TACI on innate-like B cells, and BCMA on plasmablasts and plasma cells. However, these receptors can be found on other cell types, such as BAFF-R on activated T cells.",
