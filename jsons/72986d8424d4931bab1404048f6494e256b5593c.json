The date of (term) delivery (also called the \"estimated date of confinement\" or EDC) can be calculated from the gestational age, when known or estimated from physical exam.

Assisted reproduction has made twins and triplets commonplace. Between 1980 and 1997, the number of twin live births rose 52% and the number of triplets and higher order deliveries rose 404%. 9 Higher-order pregnancies are at higher risk for complications and prematurity is commonplace.",

Two general varieties of mechanical ventilation are available: conventional ventilation and high frequency ventilation. Conventional ventilation provides a standard breath (pressure or volume) into the lungs at a given minimum rate per minute, dependent on the ventilator settings. Available neonatal systems incorporate these varieties and offer the user the ability to adjust variables (tidal volume, peak pressure, rate, PEEP, and others). The second major classification of ventilators is the high-frequency ventilator. Several types of these ventilators are available. 26 High frequency ventilation provides small gas volumes at rapid rates to decrease the pulmonary trauma. The most common type is high-frequency oscillatory ventilator (HFOV or oscillator) which cycles air in and out of the lungs rapidly. The oscillator has relatively few variables to track: mean airway pressure (MAP), displacement (delta P), frequency, and FIO 2 . While the individual level of these variables is very important, the trends of the variables and blood gas results provide a highly useful picture of an infant's respiratory status. Two other types of high frequency ventilators are in general use include the jet ventilator, which is similar to the oscillator, but cumulatively provides for oxygenation and removal of waste gases and high frequency flow interrupters (HFFI). The jet ventilator is used in combination with a conventional ventilator to provide positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and intermittent breaths. It is more complex than a conventional ventilator, with different variables: jet peak pressure (JPIP), inspiratory time, back up PEEP (baseline pressure), back up rate (0 to several breaths per minute) and back up peak pressure. HFFI is similar to jet ventilation but uses slower rates. 27 Airway pressure release ventilators (APRV) have also been used on neonates, but on a more limited basis. 28",

Very premature infants are at greatest risk for ROP and its sequelae because of the underdevelopment of retinal vessels. Regular eye exams by a pediatric ophthalmologist are necessary to monitor the growth of retinal blood vessels and for the development and progression of ROP. Frequency of ophthalmologic examinations is scheduled according to disease progression, the risk of complications (permanent blindness) and the need for intervention (retinal ablative surgery) to lessen the risk for retinal detachment. 48, 49 Neonatal follow-up tracking systems for premature infants should include the ability to track scheduling, completion, and reports of ophthalmology exams to the primary care physician and to parents to ensure appropriate future care. 49 ",
