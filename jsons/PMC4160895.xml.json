In particular, a segment of the NS5B gene, identifying genomic polymorphisms, has been used [12,2]. HCV NS5B, an RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), has been studied in various biochemical assays, cell based assays and animal model systems. NS5B variability could be associated with a worse prognosis of the disease, as demonstrated for D310N substitution in HCV 3a infected patients [13].",

The catalytic domain, formed by N-terminal 530 aa, exhibits the classical \"fingers\", \"palm\" and \"thumb\" subdomains typically seen in all RNA dependent RNA polymerases. The active site of NS5B is fully encircled by the fingers and thumb domains, which closely interact. All regular structures, studied until now, reveal a closed conformation, encircled on one side by the fingertips and on the other side by the linker and the so-called \u03b2-hairpin. Therefore, the active site is fully enclosed and the nucleotide molecules can bind easily with no further rearrangement of the domains [14,15]. As observed in in vitro studies, NS5B is able to conduct a template-directed RNA synthesis on its own, requiring only divalent metals (magnesium or manganese) as cofactors. NS5B can also catalyze both de novo synthesis from a single-stranded template and primer extension from the subsequent RNA duplex or from a pre-annealed template/primer duplex [16].",

The architecture of the membrane alterations induced by HCV reveals unexpected similarities between HCV and the unrelated picorna- and coronaviruses. Therefore, HCV induces, early during an infection, double membrane vesicles (DMVs), which emerge as protrusions of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Later on, HCV triggers multi-membrane vesicles (MMVs) that are probably the result of a cellular stress reaction [18]. Consequently, morphology of the MW depends not only on RNA replication, but also on activity of the nonstructural proteins NS3- NS5B, in concert with cellular factors [15]. Indeed, host factors such as lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III alpha (PI4KIII\u03b1) are essential for RNA replication and interact with NS5B and NS5A proteins. Silencing of PI4KIII\u03b1 reduces vesicles formation, suggesting that this enzyme is critically involved in web morphology and consequently in viral replication [19,20].",

In particular the chaperonin T-complex polypeptide (TCP1), participates in HCV RNA replication and virion production, possibly through its interaction with NS5B.

HCV NS5B sequencing could help to provide efficacy of NNI-containing regimens [33]. Blackard et al.

The informative sites distinguishing clade 1 from clade 2 are distributed throughout the genome, but are mainly located in the E1, E2, NS2, NS5A, and NS5B coding regions. In particular, one site within the 5\u2032 UTR and several sites within the NS5B genotyping fragments differ between clades 1 and 2, this information could be helpful to known if clades differ for therapy resistance. Furthermore, several variants are located at codons associated with resistance to protease inhibitors (NS3 Q41) or polymerase inhibitors (NS5B S368) [44].",
