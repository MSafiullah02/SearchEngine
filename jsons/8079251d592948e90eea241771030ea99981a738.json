The distinction between exhaled breaths of infected and healthy individuals should facilitate an understanding of the airborne transmission of infections. In this context, the present study is aimed at distinguishing healthy individuals from symptomatic ones by the study of their exhaled breath. A setup composed of a modified hood connected to an electrical low pressure impactor, which allows for the study of a wide range of particle sizes (from 7 nm to 10 lm), has been developed in order to collect exhaled breaths. This setup has been used with seventy eight volunteers. The results obtained using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that exhaled breaths of individuals without symptoms have statistical similarities and are different from those of individuals with symptoms. This separation was made by the greater proportional emission by individuals with symptoms of particles collected on stages 3 (D 50 = 0.09 lm), 6 (D 50 = 0.38 lm), 8 (D 50 = 0.95 lm), 10 (D 50 = 2.40 lm), and 12 (D 50 = 4.02 lm) of the impactor.

The dimensions of this data matrix are such that it is impossible to directly detect any similarities in statistical behavior between the volunteers (individuals) or sizes (variables).

This type of analysis was employed in other studies processing the results obtained using data from microorganisms (mould or bacterium) [26, 27] . It enables a statistical representation of all data without emitting any hypothesis. PCA generates an optimum and similar graphical representations of the scatterplot representing the data matrix. Each PCA factor is a linear combination of variables representing the maximum variance in the scatterplot. Factors have an orthogonal relationship, so that they only take independent sources of variance into account. Therefore, two spaces are constructed with the same factors, i. e., a vectorial space for variables and an observation space. Two factors define a plane on which points (observations) or vectors are projected. The proximity of two vectors (variables) indicates a strong linear correlation between these two variables, as does the proximity of two points.
