Recent studies have investigated the role of IL-18 in the host response to infection. We have previously reported that IL-18 is significantly increased in the serum of the children with acute M. pneumoniae pneumonia [7]. Interferon-inducible protein (CXCL10/IP-10) and monokine-induced by \u03b3-interferon (CXCL9/MIG) are chemokines known to selectively attract Th1 cells [8], [9]. IL-8 is a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils and regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) is known to recruit eosinophils [8], [9]. These chemokines have also been reported to be induced by M. pneumoniae infection in different model systems [1], [10], [11].",

Importantly, IL-18 was shown to improve early host response and have a protective role during Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia [19].

Our results show that these mediators are involved in the pathogenesis of this acute respiratory infection. The values of IL-18 and CXCL10, however, were significantly lower in the group of children with known asthma than those in non-asthma group. When the asthma group was divided according to the atopic status of the patients, CXCL10 was significantly lower and IL-18 showed a tendency toward lower levels in atopic asthma compared to non-atopic asthma. Our finding seems to be consistent with the previous studies that reported significantly decreased serum concentrations of IL-18 [21], [22] and CXCL10 [23] in the patients with asthma or allergic rhinitis. When the patients were divided according to the severity of pneumonia, IL-18 response was significantly decreased in the severe pneumonia group compared to the non-severe group. Decreased IL-18 response in severe pneumonia group vs. non-severe group was observed regardless of asthma status of the patients, which reached statistical significance only within asthma group. A recent study has demonstrated that asthmatic children have deficient cellular and humoral immune responses to respiratory infection with M. pneumoniae and may suffer prolonged or persistent infection [3]. In our study, asthma group presented significantly higher symptom score than non-asthma group, despite the fact that the number of subjects showing severe symptom was not different between the two patient groups. Together with the previous studies, our results suggest that some asthmatic children are more likely to experience severe symptoms when affected by M. pneumoniae pneumonia, which might be associated with deficient early IL-18 response.",

The inconsistency between those results and ours may be partially explained by different age distribution and clinical characteristics of the enrolled subjects and different criteria for severe group between the two studies. Different functions of proinflammatory cytokines in experimental pneumonia caused by different respiratory pathogens have been demonstrated. Contrary to the studies showing a protective role of IL-18 during S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae pneumonia stated above [19], [20], IL-18 was reported to impair the pulmonary host defense against Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n[25]\n. It was suggested that role of an individual cytokine such as IL-18 may be determined by the underlying state of host and the character of infecting agent [20]. Taken together with those previous studies, our findings suggest that further studies seem to be needed to find out whether the asthma- or severity-related difference in IL-18 response is specific for M. pneumoniae pneumonia in children.",
