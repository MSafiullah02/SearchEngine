Their median age was 7.5 (range, 3.7-16.6) years, and 59% of patients originated from sub-Saharan Africa or Caribbean islands. Eleven patients presented with KD shock syndrome (KDSS) requiring intensive care support, and 12 had myocarditis. All children had marked gastrointestinal symptoms at the early stage of illness and high levels of inflammatory markers. Fourteen patients (82%) had evidence of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive RT-PCR 7/17, positive IgG antibody detection 14/16). All patients received immunoglobulins and some received corticosteroids (5/17). The clinical outcome was favourable in all patients. Moderate coronary artery dilations were detected in 5 cases (29%) during hospitalisation. Conclusions: The ongoing outbreak of KD in the Paris might be related to SARS-CoV2, and shows an unusually high proportion of children with gastrointestinal involvement, KDSS and African ancestry.",

            "text": "In children and adolescents, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is mostly responsible for mild respiratory symptoms, by contrast with severe forms reported in adults. 1 2 An association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and late vasculitis manifestations has been increasingly suspected, especially in young asymptomatic patients, which may be due to post-viral immunological reactions. 3 4 Kawasaki disease (KD) is the most common primary vasculitis in childhood, affecting predominantly medium and small-sized arteries. 5 KD annual incidence is the highest in Japan, with more than 300 per 100 000 children < 4 years of age, compared to 25 per 100 000 children < 5 years of age in North America. 6 7 One of the most severe complications of KD is coronary artery aneurysm. 7 KD shock syndrome (KDSS) is a rare form of KD, frequently associated with myocarditis and requiring critical care support during the acute phase of illness. 8 9 Although the aetiology of KD remains unclear, a role of a viral trigger on some genetically predisposed children has been hypothesised, as several viral respiratory agents have been associated with KD, 10 including seasonal coronavirus in some, 11 12 but not all, studies. 13 14 Recently, nine cases of children with signs and symptoms consistent with KD and laboratory evidence of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported in the United States and England. 15 16 These reports included eight cases with hyperinflammatory syndrome and multiorgan involvement similar to what is seen in KDSS. Given the highly variable prevalence rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Europe, the possibility of an association between KD and positive testing for SARS-CoV-2 needs confirmation. Here we report a cluster of 17 patients with KD admitted to a Parisian university hospital's paediatric department that occurred between April 27 and May 7, 2020, and evaluate potential temporal association with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

KDSS is a rare complication affecting 1.5 to 7% of KD patients with a higher incidence in Western countries than in Asia. 9 It appears to result from both myocardial dysfunction and decreased peripheral vascular resistance, usually requiring IV fluid resuscitation together with inotropic and vasoactive agent infusion in ICU. 8 21 KDSS pathophysiology remains unclear. A high level of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines may contribute to the distributive component of shock. Indeed, KDSS was previously found associated with high levels of IL-6, CRP and PCT. 9 In our series, we observed very high levels of PCT, 8-fold higher than those recently reported in 27 KDSS patients. 9 CRP and IL-6 levels were also high. This major proinflammatory state may reflect a particularly strong post-viral immunological reaction to SARS-CoV-2 as compared with other viral agents. Of note, a cytokine storm syndrome with elevated inflammatory markers such as IL-6 was described in adult COVID-19 patients, 22 and has been associated with fatality. 23 Besides inflammatory markers, clinical and biological features of our patients were often consistent with the diagnosis of KDSS. Indeed, older age, higher D-dimer, lower haemoglobin and albumin levels and more severe hyponatremia were previously found associated with KDSS. 9 By contrast with the recent series of Riphagen et al, 16 only 18% of our patients were above the 75 th percentile for weight, which does not support the hypothesis All rights reserved.

IVIG resistance and coronary artery abnormalities were less frequent in our series than in previous studies. 8 9 However, these results should be taken with caution as coronary artery abnormalities may appear later during follow-up. Gastrointestinal symptoms were also unusually common, affecting 100% of our patients. Miyake et al. reported intestinal pseudo-obstruction in only 2% of 310 patients. 24 As previously described, other KD symptoms appeared in all cases after the intestinal ones, which may have led to diagnostic and therapeutic delays in some children. 25 Suspected mechanisms involve intestinal ischemia, secondary to bowel vessel vasculitis. Rapid resolution of symptoms in all patients after IVIG supports this hypothesis.",
