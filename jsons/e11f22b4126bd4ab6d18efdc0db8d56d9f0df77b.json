Methods This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 132 asthmatic subjects aged 6 to 45 years recruited from 3 different regions of Mainland China. Subjects were given a 52-week course of Alutard Der P (ALK-Abello, Horsholm, Denmark) treatment or placebo while the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) was maintained. Results 129 subjects (64 active) completed the study. The symptom scores began to diverge at week 25 with the immunotherapy group showing a significantly lower score until week 48 (P = 0.018). Immunotherapy resulted in a significant decline in symptom (P = 0.003) and medication (P = 0.044) scores during the second half of the treatment period only in subjects who were taking ICS. Subjects on ICS also showed significant improvement in PEF after immunotherapy, but no difference in histamine PC20 was found. Serum ECP and blood eosinophils decreased after immunotherapy in subjects not using ICS. Skin test response decreased in immunotherapy subjects only, and Der P-specific IgE decreased in placebo but not immunotherapy subjects. Immunotherapy resulted in a significantly greater improvement in self-evaluation scores (P < 0.01).",

            "text": "Background The most important pathological feature of asthma is airway inflammation which leads to airway hyperresponsiveness. The oxidation process is contributing in the airway inflammation of asthmatic patients. In the present study, the effects of long and short term ascorbic acid (which has antioxidant effect) administration were studied on airway responsiveness of sensitized guinea pigs. Methods An experimental model of asthma was induced in guinea pigs by sensitization of animals with injection and inhalation of ovalbumin (OA) on two groups; one with ordinary drinking water (group 2) and another with ascorbic acid (AA) in their drinking water (group 3). The responses of tracheal chains of control animals (group 1) and both groups of sensitized guinea pigs (group 2 and 3, for all groups, n = 10) to cumulative concentrations of methacholine (M) were measured, and the effective concentration of M causing 50% of maximum response (EC 50 M) was obtained. The responses of tracheal chains to 0.1% OA, relative to contraction obtained by 10 mM methacholine, were also measured. The tracheal responses to methacholine and OA were measured on both nonincubated and incubated tissues with AA. Results The tracheal responses of group 2 were significantly greater than those of group 1 and group 3 to both OA and methacholine (P < 0.05 to P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in tracheal responses to OA and methacholine between group 1 and 3 animals. Incubation of tissues caused reduction of tracheal response to methacholine in all three groups of animals but only in group 3 this difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). However, incubation of tissues did not change tracheal response to OA significantly. Conclusion These results showed that although short term administration of ascorbic acid had no major effect on tracheal responsiveness of sensitized animals, long term administration of ascorbic acid can lead to decrease in airway responsiveness of sensitized guinea pigs to both OA and methacholine.",

The effect of Ag85B on T-helper cells cytokines in PBMC from asthmatic is unknown. Methods PBMCs collected from 18 mite-sensitized asthmatic patients and 13 healthy control were stimulated with mites, Ag85B protein, supernatant of cultured 16HBE cells transfected with pMG-Ag85B alone, or the combination of mites plus Ag85B protein or plus Ag85B supernatant. After 96 hours incubation, levels of IL-5 and IFN-g were determined. Results In the asthmatic group, there was an significant increase of IL-5 level after stimulation with mites as compared with control. Level of IFN-g increased significantly by co-stimulation of mites plus Ag85B protein or plus the Ag85B supernatant in comparison with the mites alone (87.60 \u00b1 36.45) pg/ml or (111.5 \u00b1 15.9) pg/ml vs (58.8 \u00b1 7.8) pg/ml, respectively, P < 0.05. There was no significant difference among groups in IL-5 level in those patients or either IL-5 or IFN-g levels in normal subjects. Conclusions Ag85B protein or the supernatant harvested from cultured 16HBE cells transfected with pMG-Ag85B could upregulated Th1 response in PBMC with allergen stimulation from asthmatic patients. The annual asthma death toll in the Tohoku district was surveyed from 1992 to 2001. The survey inquired whether physicians or pediatricians had cases of asthma death during the period of the previous year, and was conducted by sending postcards in every February. Then, details of each fatality were further examined by questionnaire. A total of 299 cases of fatal asthma attack (male: 186, female: 113) were compiled from the survey conducted over a period of 10 years. Middle-aged and elderly asthmatics over 50 years old accounted for two-thirds of all the cases. Among asthmatics younger than 50 years age, the death toll of patients in their first decade was the highest. 78% of the total cases were outpatients. 60% of them were in cardiopulmonary arrest and 89% were classified as severe exacerbation or worse upon their arrival at the hospital. 25.6% and 39.6% of the death patients were diagnosed as dead only within 2 hrs and 24 hrs after the onset of asthmatic attacks, respectively. Cases of duration of 1 to 10 years of asthma outnumbered others, whereas 16 cases (5.3%) died within 1 year after the onset of their asthma. 34% of the cases had been scored as severe asthma before the death, whereas 45% and 21% had been diagnosed as moderate and mild, respectively. The number of deaths from asthma attacks in the Tohoku district was clearly reduced over the past 5 years. The current annual death toll plummeted by 75% compared to a decade ago, when our annual survey was commenced. In Tohoku district, death from asthma attacks was surveyed from 1992 to 2001. After presence of death from asthma attacks during the previous year were confirmed by postcard at the beginning of every February, details of each case were asked by questionnaire. In total, 299 cases (male: 186, female: 113) were recognized as death from asthma attacks. Middle-aged and older asthmatics over 50 years accounted for 2/3 of the cases and the most death was recorded in asthmatics in the second decade of life under 50. Outpatients accounted for 78%. When they visited hospitals, 60% was in cardiopulmonary arrest and 89% was in more critical condition than severe attacks. About duration of attacks from the onset to their death, within 2 hrs accounted for 25.6%, within 1 day did for 39.6%, and over 1 day did for 34.8%. Although the most death was found in patients whose duration of asthma was between 1 and 10 years, 16 cases died within 1 year from the onset of their asthma. About severity during the past year, 34% had severe asthma, 45% moderate, and 21% mild. Number of death from asthma attacks in Tohoku district was clearly reduced over the past 5 years. The number was reduced to about one-fourth of that at the beginning of survey.",

In this study we investigated the effects of a respirable p38a MAPK antisense oligonucleotide (p38a-ASO) on airway inflammation in a murine model of asthma. Methods The p38a MAPK knock-down effect of p38a-ASO was confirmed in a mouse T cell line (EL4) and a mouse macrophage line RAW264.7 using Western blotting. BALB/c mice were actively sensitized by i.p. injections of ovalbumin (OVA) for 18 days followed by aerosol OVA challenge for the next 3 days. Daily aerosolized p38a-ASO treatments (estimated doses of 0.3, 1.5 and 3 mg/kg) of the mice were given from day 14 to day 20. Mismatched ASO was used as a negative control. Results p38a MAPK ASO but not the mismatched ASO dose-dependently suppressed methacholine-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in sensitized mice measured by whole body plethysmography. The p38a MAPK ASO significantly (P < 0.05) reduced OVA-induced increases in total cell counts and eosinophils recovered in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. In addition, histological studies reveal that p38a-ASO markedly inhibited OVA-induced inflammatory cell infiltration into the lungs (H&E stain) and mucus hypersecretion in the airway epithelium (PAS stain). The p38a-ASO dosedependently inhibited OVA-induced increase in Th2 cytokine levels in BAL fluid. Further, p38a MAPK ASO significantly (P < 0.05) abated the blood levels of total IgE, OVA-specific IgE and OVA-specific IgG 1 in sensitized mice as compared to the mismatched ASO. Conclusion Taken together, respirable p38a MAPK ASO may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of asthma. (This work was supported by a NMRC grant NMRC/0433/2000.)",

We examined the role of histamine in goblet cell hyperplasia using histamine deficient mice (HDC KO mouse) in which HDC gene was disrupted. Method Wild and HDC KO C57bl/6 mice were sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA). After two-week exposure to OVA, lungs were excised and goblet cell hyperplasia was evaluated histologically. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected and cell differentials were calculated. RNA was extracted from lung tissues and Gob-5 mRNA was analyzed by the quantitative RT-PCR. Result While the total number of cells in BALF was significantly higher in KO-mice than in wild mice (28.2 \u00a5 104 \u00b1 3.4 vs 62.0 \u00a5 104 \u00b1 5.6 \u00a5 104; mean \u00b1 SEM), the ratio of eosinophils was lower in KO-mice than in wild mice (91 \u00b1 8% vs 42 \u00b1 7%). The mRNA level of Gob-5 was greatly increased in KO mouse compared to wild mice (108 \u00b1 35 vs 182 \u00b1 61; Gob-5/GAPDH). The ratio of the goblet cell in the airway epithelium was markedly increased in KO-mice compared to wild mice. Conclusion It was suggested that histamine plays a role in goblet cell hyperplasia of airway epithelium in allergic airway inflammation.",

Objectives The aims of this study were to audit the level of knowledge of adult asthmatic outpatients at a tertiary care hospital, to determine the sources of asthma information and to determine variables associated with poor asthma knowledge. Methods We conducted a prospective, cross sectional survey on 94 asthmatic subjects using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Results Of the 94 subjects, 39.4% were ignorant of the inflammatory nature of asthma while 56.4% did not understand the role of prednisolone in acute exacerbation of asthma. Only 17.0% reported having a written action plan. Lower educational level and older age were significantly associated with lower asthma knowledge scores. The doctor was the main source of asthma information. Asthma knowledge scores were significantly higher among those who named the doctor, pamphlets, newspapers, internet and books as a source of asthma information. In multiple linear regression analysis, educational level, having doctors and newspapers as a source of asthma information were independently associated with asthma knowledge scores. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that a large number of asthmatics have poor understanding of some aspects of their disease and have no written asthma action plan. Asthmatics with lower educational level have poor asthma knowledge and should be specifically targeted in asthma education programmes.",

Methods Structured literature review searched available data between 1990 and 2004 using Medline Database, World Wide Web, abstract books from recent academic conferences and available reports. The following key words were used alone or in combination: asthma, allergic rhinitis, prevalence, resource use, cost, quality of life and functioning, and specific country names. Results Asthma-related resource use in Asia is mainly driven by the use of hospital and emergency services, as on average 40% but up to 86% of patients with asthma experienced hospitalization or required emergency assistance during any given one year period. The latter figure may be even higher in case of the patients with more severe asthma. Despite development and introduction of novel therapies, trends in asthma-related hospitalizations did not decline consistently over the past 2 decades mainly because of inconsistent use of available therapies and potentially due to patient aversion to inhaled treatment options. In addition, concomitant allergic rhinitis, which has been shown to worsen outcomes in patients with asthma, appears to be highly associated with asthma in Asia as well. Prevalence of AR among asthmatics was reported as 38.2% in all patients, and 10.1 ~74.4% in adults. This may further increase economic burden of asthma in the region. Conclusion This review shows that evidence on high economic burden of asthma in Asia is available, though may be of variable quality. Despite this it further emphasizes the need for improvement of current asthma control and treatment in Asia. Special attention should be devoted to patients with asthma and comorbid disease such as allergic rhinitis, as preliminary evidence suggests added burden in this population.",

Apart from inflammatory cells, resident cells such as fibroblasts are also proposed to play critical roles in the switch from acute inflammation to adaptive immunity and tissue repair. Although asthma is perceived as a disease with a particular profile of Th2 cytokines, increasing evidence indicates that TNF-a, a classical Th1 cytokine, is also associated with the inflammatory response that characterize human asthma. Methods Total proteins from both cell lysates and supernatants between normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLF) and TNF-a induced NHLF were separated by two-dimensional (2-DE) gel electrophoresis, and proteins with significant changes were subsequently identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. RT-PCR was further applied to confirm the proteomics findings.",

            "text": "Results Several proteins were found to be markedly induced by TNF-a. These included some cell protective proteins: antiviral MxA GTPase, ubiquitin-like protein ISG-15, serine proteinase inhibitor PAI-2, and antioxidant protein MnSOD; and two intracellular enzymes for collagen modification: prolyl hydroxylase (PH) a subunit and lysyl hydroxylase 2, isoform a (LH2a). In addition, some proteins with unclear functions were found to be significantly down-regulated. Conclusion These results not only demonstrate that proteomics is an efficient way to study the underlying molecular mechanisms after cytokine stimulation, but also indicate that Th1 cytokine TNF-a, which is increased in asthmatic airway, can induce major alterations in global protein expression in NHLF leading to airway inflammation and remodeling. (Supported by a grant BMRC 01/1/21/17/046 by the Biomedical Research Council in Singapore.) Background and Objectives With increasing need to use limited resources effectively, study reports on burden of asthma in Asia are gradually growing both in terms of numbers and scope. We therefore reviewed and synthesized currently available data on resource use, school-absence, functioning and quality of life among pediatric patients with asthma from Asia. Methods Structured literature review searched available data between 1990 and 2004 using Medline Database, World Wide Web, abstract books from recent academic conferences and available reports. The following key words were used alone or in combination: asthma, child, resource use (i.e. hospitalizations), cost, school absence, functioning, quality of life and specific country names. Results Similar to adults, asthma-related resource use among children in Asia is mainly driven by the use of hospital and emergency services. Annually between 42.6-44.7% of children neither confirmed or suspected asthma visited asthma clinics/emergency departments (ED) in Hong Kong and China, where 3.5% of asthmatic children were also hospitalized due to an asthma attack. Similarly, asthma was the 2 nd most common reason for discharge and the 2 nd leading condition seen by general physicians and government polyclinics in Singapore during late 80s and early 90s. As seen in other regions, younger children (<5 years) were more than 2-times more likely hospitalized compared to older children (>5 years) and were thus responsible for about 60 ~80% of all asthmatic admission. School-loss, impaired functioning and impact on quality of life were also significant in young asthmatics. Conclusion Across Asia, there are currently few studies of resource use and general burden of asthma in pediatric patients. However, they consistently show higher impact on younger children (<5 years) and high reliance on emergency and hospital care for asthma. There appears to be room for improvement in terms of treatment options in order to reduce reliance on secondary care for asthma which will likely result in decreased economic burden on societies.",

Methods A cross-sectional study with systematic sampling of asthma patients from August to October 2003 involving all primary healthcare clinics. Results A total of 207 patients were enrolled with mean age of 49 years and mean duration of asthma of 15.5 years. Malay ethnic group formed the majority (65.7%) and 54.1% were women. Most patients had severe persistent asthma (41.5%) and they were in older age group as well. Inhaled salbutamol sulfate was the most widely used quickrelieving medication (51.2%) whereas inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate was the commonest long-term preventive medication (35.7%) followed by sustained-release theophylline (8.7%) and inhaled budesonide (6.3%). Over half (55.2%) of the persistent asthma patients did not receive any inhaled corticosteroids therapy. Among those patients receiving inhaled corticosteroids, the median dosage was only 200 mg daily (min = 100 mg, max = 600 mg). Of the moderate and severe persistent asthma patients without any inhaled corticosteroids therapy, most of them were prescribed with regular oral short-acting bronchodilator (salbutamol, terbutaline and theophylline) acting as 'preventive treatment'. Inhaled corticosteroids were less frequently prescribed to patients with severe persistent asthma (39.5%) compared with mild persistent asthma (65.1%). Conclusion Most patients had severe persistent asthma and the asthma management was sub-optimal in which underuse of preventive medications is wide spread especially among those with severe persistent asthma. 1 ",

            "text": "Background International guidelines recommend a range of clinical tests to confirm the diagnosis of asthma. These focus largely on identifying variable airflow obstruction and responses to bronchodilator or corticosteroid. More recently, the use of exhaled nitric oxide (FE NO ) measurements and induced sputum analysis to assess airway inflammation have been highlighted. However, to date, no systematic comparisons to confirm the diagnostic utility of each of these methods have been carried out. Methods We investigated 47 consecutive patients who were referred by their general practitioner with symptoms suggestive of asthma using a comprehensive fixed sequence of investigations and diagnostic accuracies were calculated. Results Mean FE NO levels were significantly higher in the asthmatic (n = 17) compared to the non-asthmatic (n = 30) patients (52.0 ppb (95% CI: 35.8, 68.2) and 15.7 ppb (95% CI: 11.1, 20.3) respectively, P < 0.001). Sensitivities and specificities respectively for a diagnosis of asthma were as follows; > 20% peak flow variation (0%, 100%); >15% peak flow response to steroid (24%, 100%); FEV 1 < 80% predicted (29%, 100%); FEV 1 /FVC ratio <70% (35%, 100%); >15% FEV 1 response to steroid (12%, 100%); induced sputum eosinophils analysis (86%, 88%); FE NO measurement (88%, 79%). Overall, the diagnostic accuracy based on comparisons of receiver operated characteristic (ROC) curves was significantly greater for FE NO and sputum eosinophils. Conclusion FE NO measurements and induced sputum analysis are superior to conventional approaches as diagnostic tools in asthma, with the advantage for FE NO that the test is quick and easy to perform.

It is crucial to study the intracellular signal pathway in the airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) proliferation for understanding the mechanism of asthma and developing potential therapies. Protein kinase C (PKC) participates in the proliferation of many sorts of cells, but currently further study of PKC signal transduction in regulating ASMCs proliferation and the downstream of PKC activation is rarely found both home and abroad. Nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB), an important transduction factor, also assisting in proliferation of many cells, is mainly studied in vascular smooth muscle cells, and takes the part of downstream common factor in a great many signal transduction pathways. However, there has been no report whether NF-kB contributes to regulating ASMCs proliferation and whether it is the downstream factor of activated PKC or not. Methods As ASMCs from asthmatic patients is difficult to obtained, investigators abroad etablished a model for studying the biological behavior of asthmatic ASMCs by using serum from asthmatic patients to passively sensitized non-asthmatic human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). In our experiment, 10% asthmatic patients' serum was prepared, as well as 10% non-asthmatic human serum as control. PKC agonist Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 and NF-kB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) were used to treat these cells. The NF-kB activation was detected by NF-kBp65 immunofluorescence staining and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The expression of inhibitory protein kBa (I-kBa) was detected by Western blot. The proliferation of HASMCs was examined by Flow Cytometry (FCM), MTT colorimetric assay and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunofluorescence staining. The aim was to explore the contribution of NF-kB to the proliferation of passively sensitized HASMCs, and whether NF-kB was the downstream factor of activated PKC or not. Results According to results of the experiments, it was found that: (1) The proliferation of passively sensitized non-asthmatic HASMCs, expression of NF-kBp65 in nucleus and the combination of NF-kB with DNA were significantly increased, compared with those treated with controlled serum (P < 0.05); wheras when treated with 100 mmol/L PDTC, the proliferation of passively sensitized HASMCs, expression of NF-kBp65 and the combination of NF-kB with DNA were significantly decreased, only compared with passively sensitized non-asthmatic HASMCs (P < 0.05).",

(3) After treated with 10 nmol/L PMA, the proliferation of HASMCs, expression of NF-kBp65 and the combination of NF-kB with DNA were significantly increased, only compared with passively sensitized HASMCs, HASMCs treated with both 10 nmol/L PMA and 100 mmol/L PDTC, HASMCs treated with 10 nmol/L PMA (P < 0.05). Conclusion All these findings indicated that NF-kB might take part in the proliferation of passively sensitized non-asthmatic HASMCs, in which there is PKC -NF-kB signal pathway. To block this signal transduction pathway on various points is significant to suppress asthmatic ASMCs proliferation and relieve airway remodeling.",

            "text": "Background In vitro studies show that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the beta2-adrenoceptor (ADRB2) alter receptor function. Clinical studies show that the Arg-16 variant is associated with increased response to single doses of beta-agonist, and, paradoxically, with decreased lung function during regular beta2-agonist use. The importance of ADRB2 haplotypes (combinations of SNPs) has received only limited attention. Our aim was to compare acute bronchodilator responsiveness for the five commonest ADRB2 haplotypes in patients with asthma. Methods 154 patients underwent prospective DNA analysis for ADRB2 haplotype (2/2, 2/4, 2/6, 4/4, 4/6, and 'other'). Inhaled beta-agonists were withdrawn completely and ipratropium was substituted as 'reliever'. Inhaled corticosteroids were withdrawn until 'loss of control' or for three weeks maximum. Spirometry was measured before and 20 minutes after inhaled salbutamol (2.5 mg nebulised) Results There were 28, 49, 25, 17, 21 and 14 patients harbouring the 2/2, 2/4, 2/6, 4/4, 4/6 and 'other' haplotypes respectively. The mean pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 (all) was 2.69 litres (SD 0.98), 81.6% predicted (SD 23.0%). The mean postbronchodilator FEV 1 (all) was 3.00 litres (SD 0.98), an increase of 13.9% (SD 11.9). For individual haplotypes, the % reversibility was: 2/2: 15.9 (10.6); 2/4: 11.2% (8.3); 2/6: 15.9% (15.3); 4/4: 17.6% (16.0); 4/6: 13.3% (12.5). Analysis of co-variance with baseline FEV 1 as co-variate did not reveal any significant relationship between ADRB2 haplotype and bronchodilator response. Conclusion In contrast to previous data, we were unable to confirm that ADRB2 haplotype is an important determinant of bronchodilator response in asthma.

            "text": "Background Myofibroblasts, the main feature of which is represented by an important contractile apparatus similar to that of smooth muscle and in particular by the neo-expression of a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA), have been thought to participate in airway remodeling in asthma. Bronchial epithelium with injury has been demonstrated to be responsible for the increase in levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. Thus we hypothesize that injured airway epithelial cells (AECs) might be driving sub-epithelial fibroblasts to differentiate towards myofibroblasts, through which, injured AECs play a critical role in the development of airway hyperreactivity (AHR). Methods Human primary cultured airway subepithelial fibroblasts (HPAFs) were co-cultured with human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE-14o, HBECs) treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 12 hrs prior to co-culture followed by being scratched. The procedure was also performed in the presence or absence of ET-1 receptor A inhibitor (BQ123), anti-TGFb-1 neutralized antibody and BQ123 plus anti-TGFb-1 respectively. Following that, the HPAFs were subjected to the detection of alpha-SMA expression and cells proliferation by using western blotting, immunostaining and Brdu incorporation respectively. In addition, using MAPK signal pathways specific inhibitors SB203580, PD98058 and SP600125, the activity of main members of MAPK family including p38 kinase, ERK 1/2 and JNK in the processes was also tested for evaluating the role of MAPK pathways in the induction of alpha-SMA. To investigate the source of the increased ET-1 in the co-culture, the interaction between matrix metalloproteinas (MMPs) and ET-1 was studied by using cell transfection with anti-endothelin converting enzyme (anti-ECE) mRNA expression plasmid (P-anti-ECE) and gelatin zymography. Results HBECs treated with LPS plus mechanical injury induced a-SMA expression and accelerated proliferation in HPAFs. Addition of the both of BQ123 and anti-TGFb-1 blocked the induction completely. The co-culture with injured HBECs induced the production of Phosphorated p38 and ERK 1/2 in the HPAFs, but not in those HPAFs with normal 16 HBE. SB203580 and PD98059 abolished the induction of a-SMA expression in the HPAFs co-cultured with the injured HBECs. Both of MMP-2 and MMP9 released from the injured HBECs transfected with blank vector into supernatants were increased significantly, compared to normal control and the HBECs transfected with P-anti-ECE. Conclusion Our results suggest that Myofibroblasts transdifferentiation was induced in the subepithelial fibroblasts living with injury HBE cells, leading to the occurrence of AHR. The increase in levels of ET-1 and TGF associated with injured airway epithelium was contributing to the transdifferentiation through MARK signal pathways of P38 and ERK 1/2. Background The recent identification of new costimulatory pathways with specialized effector activities has afforded novel, prospective therapeutics for a variety of immunologic disorders. The inducible costimulator (ICOS)/B7-homlog 2 (B7-H2) has received attention based on its putative role in T cell effector function. The Requirement of ICOS/B7-H2 costimulatory pathway for asthma is controversial. Methods Female BALB/c mice sensitized with ovalbumin were administered with recombinant B7-H2 fusion protein 50 mg before the first challenge. The lungs were lavaged and removed 48 hours after the last challenge. The nucleated cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were counted and morphologically differentiated. The levels of IL-5 and INF-g in the BALF were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The routine histologic analysis was performed. Results In recombinant B7-H2 group (n = 6), the pathologic change of airway inflammation was exacerbated, and the number of nucleated cells [(48.08 \u00b1 4.50) \u00a5 10 6 /L], eosinophils [(2.91 \u00b1 0.20) \u00a5 10 6 /L] and lymphocytes [(24.87 \u00b1 0.94) \u00a5 10 6 /L] in BALF was significantly increased as compared with asthma control group [(29.63 \u00b1 5.22) \u00a5 10 6 /L, (0.86 \u00b1 0.10) \u00a5 10 6 /L, (10.50 \u00b1 0.55) \u00a5 10 6 /L, respectively] (P < 0.05). The levels of IL-5 [(536.40 \u00b1 112.30) ng/L] in the BALF from recombinant B7-H2 group were significantly higher than those in asthma control group [(379.84 \u00b1 73.02) ng/L] (P < 0.05). INF-g levels [(100.20 \u00b1 15.92) ng/L] in the BALF from recombinant B7-H2 group showed no differences as compare to that from the asthmatic control group [(98.73 \u00b1 16.41) ng/L] (P > 0.05). Conclusion The costimulatory signals provided by B7-H2 and its receptor, ICOS, may be required for airway inflammation through regulating Th2 response in a murine model of allergic asthma.",

We sought to examine the impact of smoking among asthmatics enrolled in this program. Methods Data was extracted from a database of asthmatics from a single center in a nation-wide program for asthma control. Results There were a total of 438 patients enrolled as of October 2003. Among these, 109 (24.9%) reported a history of ever having smoked. 52 (11.9%) were current smokers, a figure similar to the national average of 13.8%. Current smokers were significantly younger (median age 38 years vs. 47 years in nonsmokers, P < 0.05), more likely to be male (76.9% vs 71.5%, P < 0.005) and reported a shorter duration of asthma (14.7 years vs. 17.1 yrs, P = 0.02). There was no difference in FEV1, PEFR or severity of asathma according to GINA classification. Interestingly, among those who had quit smoking, most (11/58 or 18.9%) reported that they had quit within the first year after their asthma was diagnosed. Conclusion Newly diagnosed asthma seems to be a significant impetus for smokers to quit smoking and efforts to encourage smoking cessation could be focussed on this group of patients. Smoking cessation should be an integral part of the asthma control program.",

We divided the influenza A patients into two groups; the cases accompanying with an acute exacerbation of asthma was group 1 (G-1): 12 patients (44%), and the cases without exacerbation was group 2 (G-2): 15 patients (56%). The average age of G-1 is higher than G-2. (mean age \u00b1 SE: G-1 51.1 \u00b1 5.1 y, G-2: 28.0 \u00b1 SE2.9 y).There was numerically superior in female in G-1 (men : female = 1 : 11). We also divided asthma patients by the classification of JGL'2003 (Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of bronchial asthma by JAPANESE SOCIETY OF ALLERGOLOGY: JSA) based on the serious degree; step 3 and step 4 were predominant in G-1 (step 1: 25%, step 2: 8.3%, step 3: 33.3%, step 4: 25%): step 1 and step 2 were predominant in G-2 (step 1: 61.1%, step 2: 22.2%, step 3: 11.1%, step 4: 0%). There was no clinical exacerbation of asthma in patients with influenza B.",

Asthma self-management plan has been shown beneficial in reducing asthma morbidity, use of health services and even mortality in studies in many parts of the world. However, data on the effectiveness of such programme in Hong Kong are lacking. Study Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of an asthma selfmanagement programme on asthma-related use of medical services, absenteeism from work and morbidity in patients admitted to the Queen Mary Hospital for acute asthma in Hong Kong. Method Patients were randomized into the intervention and the control group, and followed up for 12 months. The intervention group received the Asthma Self-management Program with a written self-action plan and usual care while the control group received only usual care. Both groups were given asthma education. Comparisons of outcomes at 12 months were made between the 2 groups with respect to the ratio of asthma related hospitalization, A&E visits, visits to general practitioners, days off work, asthma symptomatology, use of medications and lung function.",

Methods Sixteen adult guinea pigs were divided into four groups of four cases in random: control group, saline group (NS), exhilarant stimulant group and inhibitor group. Injected the ovalbumin to abdominal cavity to establish the models of asthma guinea pigs, and then injected saline, aurintricarboxylic-acid (ATA) and MEK inhibitor (PD98059) into the lateral ventricle respectively. After that we observed the variations of praxiology, respiratory resistance and airway exudation. The experimental animal caused asthma by absorbing the ovalbumin aerosol, but the control group absorbed saline instead of the ovalbumin aerosol, and then 1-2 minutes later, we assay the respiratory resistance and respiratory rate respectively. In order to assay the airway exudation, we use Evinse Blue and measured the OD value 1 minute after guinea pigs inhaling ovalbumin aerosol.",

The inhibition of mCLCA3 by active immunity should be a useful approach to prevent asthma. Methods We recombined the DNA vaccine based on xenogeneic homologous human CLCA1 (hCLCA1) and named it pSecTag2B/hCLCA1. BALB/c mice were vaccinated by i.m. once every two weeks with vaccine. Asthma was induced with ovalbumin in DNA vaccine group when antiserum was identified having the binding activity to extracellular domains (ED) of mCLCA3 by ELISA analysis. Other mice were divided into control-vector, control-saline and normal group. Asthma was also induced in the two control groups. The number of airway goblet cells was detected with periodic acid-Schiff staining, and lung MUC5AC mRNA level was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. Results Antiserum of DNA vaccine group showed good binding activity to three mCLCA3 EDs, and the activity to N-terminal and C-terminal ED was stronger than middle ED. After asthma induction, the number of goblet cells in small bronchioles and MUC5AC mRNA level of lung in vaccine group were significantly lower than those in two control groups. There was no significant difference between vaccine group and normal group. Conclusion hCLCA1 DNA vaccine can induce mouse to produce serum antibody cross-binding to mCLCA3 itself, and thus airway mucus overproduction of asthmatic mouse is effectively inhibited. The mechanism of vaccine may be that mCLCA3 activity were blocked by antibody.",

            "text": "Recently, it has been found that CD4+45RO+ T cell/memory T cell is a kind of dominating cell in asthma, for example, about 95 percent of total cells in bronchial walls of asthma are memory T cells [2] . The selective activation of CD4+45RO+ T cell can conduce assembling of eosinocytes, airway hyperreactivity and asthmatic attack [3] . Furthermore, more and more studies about asthmatic pathogenesis focus on costimulatory molecules now. Besides the main CD28-B7 pathway [4], CD152-B7 pathway has been paid more attention, which plays a negative regulatory role in proliferation of T cells and can inhibit the production of cytokines induced by allergens [5] . The object of our study is researching the effect of anti-human CD152 monoclonal antibody on secretion of IL-4 and IL-13 of CD4+45RO+ T cell in patients with atopic asthma. In our study, 16 subjects were recruited, including 8 patients with atopic asthma, who had medical history of mite allergy, positive bronchiectasis test, positive skin test about mite, positive mite-specific IgE in sera, and who had not been given glucocorticoid before drawn blood, and 8 healthy control ones. We drew 10 ml anticoagulated blood from every subject, and then got CD4+45RO+ T cell by immunomagnetic microbead abstraction, whose purity checked by flow cytometer was more than 95%. When we mixed cultured CD4+45RO+T cells with self B cells, we designed three groups: without stimulation, single mite extractive antigen stimulation and stimulation with mite extractive and antihuman CD152 antibody together. Then we collected supernatant of every sample after culturing 36 hours, and detected the concentration of IL-4 and IL-13 in supernatant by ELISA. Results 1. There was no difference between asthma and control in the production of IL-4 and IL-13, when CD4+45RO+T cells were cultured without stimulating (P > 0.05). 2. The concentration of IL-4 and IL-13 secreted by CD4+45RO+T cells increased on the asthmatic group after mite extractive stimulating (P < 0.05), and was higher than control group (P < 0.05), who had no change after mite extractive stimulating (P > 0.05). 3. The CD4+45RO+ T cells of control subjects secreted significantly less IL-4 and IL-13 when stimulated by mite extractive and antihuman CD152 antibody together than when stimulated by mite extractive singly (P < 0.005). But there was no significant change in IL-4 secretion of asthmatic patients' memory T cells after adding antihuman CD152 antibody (P > 0.05). There was slightly decrease in IL-13 secretion of asthmatic patients'memory T cells after adding antihuman CD152 (P < 0.05), but the percentage of decrease was less than control subjects (P < 0.05). Because CD4+45RO+ T cells of asthmatic patients were mite specific in our study, when they were stimulated with mite extractive once, they were activated and secreted more IL-4 and IL-13, as maybe play an important role in the pathogenesis of asthma. Our data show that antihuman CD152 antibody can inhibit the secretion of IL-4 and IL-13 in CD4+45RO+ T cell of control subjects significantly. It has been shown that CD152 plays an important role in regulating initiation and termination of T cell response in some studies. Especially at the later stage of immune reaction, CD152 can bind to B7 more efficiently than CD28, so that it can inhibit T cell entering S stage from G1 stage, inhibit the activity of IL-2 transcription factor, and cause downregulation and termination of T cell response. In our study, we adopted a small dose of antihuman CD152 antibody as stimulant, which can activate but not block CD152 on CD4+45RO+ T cells, open the CD152-B7 pathway, and inhibit secretion of IL-4 and IL-13 by memory T cells. But in asthmatic subjects, antihuman CD152 antibody can not downregulate IL-4 secretion, and the decrease of IL-13 is lower than control subjects. The reason for this result, we think is that: 1. CD152 on allergen-specific CD4+45RO+ T cell of asthmatic patients has been over activated (but still less activated than CD28), so it is not sensitive to small dose antihuman CD152 antibody. 2. There is some disfunction on CD152 on CD4+45RO+ T cell of asthmatic subjects, so the response to CD152 antibody is weak. Conclusions CD4+45RO+ T cell of patients with atopic asthma can secrete more IL-4 and IL-13, when touching the same allergen once. Antihuman CD152 antibody can activate CD152 on CD4+45RO+ T cell of healthy subjects, simulate the inhibition of CD152-B7 pathway, and then reduce the secretion of IL-4 and IL-13. But in asthmatic patients, the activation of antihuman CD152 antibody to CD152 is weaken. The results hint that CD152-B7 pathway or CD152 on CD4+45RO+ T cell of asthmatic patients is abnormal, as maybe can explain partly the increase of secretion of IL-4 and IL-13 in asthmatic patients. Background Increased activation of nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) might be the basis for chronicity of airway inflammation in asthma.",

Methods Thirty-six BALB/c mice were randomly divided into the control group, the asthmatic group (subdivided into 1, 4, 12 and 24 h timepoints after the last airway challenge of ovalbumin), and the therapeutic group of As 2 O 3 (4 mg/kg). The characteristic recruitment of eosinophils (EOS) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), the pulmonary NF-kB activity and IkBa expression were detected by Diff-Quick staining, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and Western blot analysis, respectively. Results In the control group, the recruitment of EOS in BALF, pulmonary NF-kB activity and IkBa expression were (0.5 \u00b1 0.2)%, 51.4 \u00b1 4.5 and 0.80 \u00b1 0.25, respectively. The asthmatic group had higher recruitment of EOS in BALF (P < 0.01) and pulmonary NF-kB activity (P < 0.01) and lower pulmonary IkBa expression (P < 0.01) than did the control group, respectively, in which NF-kB activation was increased within 1 h (P < 0.01), peaked by 4 h (P < 0.01), and dissipated by 12 h (P < 0.01) to 24 h (P < 0.05) after the last airway challenge. In contrast to the asthmatic group, the three parameters changed reversedly significantly (P < 0.01) after exposure to As 2 O 3 , and there was a significant negative correlation between either recruitment of EOS in BALF or pulmonary NF-kB activity and pulmonary IkBa expression (r = -0.82 and -0.94, P < 0.01). Conclusion It is a vital mechanism for As 2 O 3 to exert its multiple antiinflammation by inhibition of pulmonary NF-kB activation through induction of IkBa expression. Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex disease which is influenced by genetic factors, environmental influences, and genotype-environment interactions. Smoking is the major causal factor in the development of the disease, While only 10-20% of chronic heavy cigarette smokers have respiratory symptoms, which suggests the presence of genetic susceptibility. Protease-antiprotease imblance is the mechinsm of COPD, MMP-9 has proteolytic activity against connective tissue proteins and it plays important roles in the destruction and remodeling of lung tissue of COPD.

The overall response was about 50% considering both tests. The same picture was noted for FVC. Conclusion bronchodilator response in non-smoking female bakers to salbutamol and oral steroid is higher than we expect in common smoker's COPD and so asthmatic component may play a major role airflow limitation of these patients. Long-term effect of inhaled steroids has worth to be tried in this population of patients. Background Hypersecretion of mucus in airway is an important feature in chronic obstructive disease but effective treatment still lacks. In this study, we investigate the effect of dexamethasone on acrolein-induced MUC5AC expression in rat airways and whether it affects through signal transduction pathway mediated by nuclear factor-kB and protein kinase C. Methods Rat model of mucus hypersecretion of airways was established by exposing to 3.0 ppm acrolein fog 6 hours per day for 12 days. Animals were also injected intraperitoneally with dexamethasone (0.1 mg.kg -1 .d -1 or 0.5 mg.kg -1 .d -1 ) with or without exposing to acrolein fog. The mRNA of MUC5AC and the protein of MUC5AC, nuclear factor-kB, IkB-a and PKC in trachea of each animal were detected by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The release of TNFa and IL-8 in BALF was measured by ELISA.",

For these questionnaires, we now present a scoring system for use in primary care. Methods We developed separate scoring systems for each questionnaire. Scores were developed by weighting responses to each question based upon its regression coefficient from the final regression model. Two thresholds or 'cutpoints' for the scores were chosen to assign subjects to one of three zones of likelihood of having fixed obstruction: 1) High Likelihood (high predictive value of a positive test), 2) Intermediate Likelihood, or 3) Low Likelihood (high predictive value of a negative test).",

Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major public health concern in Asian countries since smoking prevalence rates are extremely high and continue to increase. Furthermore in the Asian-Pacific regions, which comprise both developed and developing countries, indoor air pollution from biomass fuel, utilized for cooking and to generate heat (heating) in poorly vented dwellings, is postulated to be another important risk factor for the development of COPD. Methods We conducted a questionnaire survey toward chest physicians or internists to investigate the awareness and consensus on the GOLD guideline as well as how COPD patients have been cared and managed in Asian region since the release of the GOLD guideline.

Ten patients had predominant emphysema (47.6%), 4 had predominant chronic bronchitis (19%), and the rest (n = 7) had mixed clinical pictures of both emphysema and chronic bronchitis (33.3%). The median FEV1 percent was 28. Overall, diastolic dysfunction was present in 15 patients (75%), of which eight patients (53.3%) had predominant emphysema, six patients had mixed disease (40%), and one patient had chronic bronchitis (6.7%). We found that patients with higher FEV1 had lower likelihood of having concomitant diastolic dysfunction (Odds Ratio: 0.18, 90% CI: 0.04-0.78), and that resting tachycardia was positively associated with diastolic dysfunction (OR: 9.75, 90% CI: 1.38-68.8). Conclusion Diastolic dysfunction is highly prevalent among advanced COPD patients. Low FEV1 and resting tachycardia are potential clinical markers for diastolic dysfunction among COPD patients. Background Measurement of health status is an important component to compliment physiologic measures in assessing the natural history and/or response to therapy in patients with COPD. There are relatively few reports of the relation of these measures in Japanese COPD patients. Methods Two clinical trials in the tiotropium development program in Japan (n = 193 and 147) afforded the opportunity to evaluate the association of health status, symptoms, and spirometry. Measured parameters included spirometry, respiratory symptoms, as well as patient impression (PI), physician evaluation (PE) and St. Geoge's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) (one study). Associations between the responses (i.e. inherent changes or deltas from baseline) in each parameter after 4 weeks or one year treatment with tiotropium or oxitropium were evaluated. Results Patients global impression (PI) after one year or 4 weeks were positively associated with physician global evaluation (PE) (r = 0.69 in both studies), with physician evaluation correlating more strongly with FEV 1 (r = -0.45 and -0.29) than patient impression (r = -0.27 and -0.06 respectively). For health status; however, associations of SGRQ with PI and PE were mores similar in magnitude (r = 0.38 and 0.35). Conclusion These data indicate that the direction and magnitude of associations of spirometry with health status in Japanese COPD patients is similar to those found in Western cohorts. The data also suggest that, in this clinical trial setting, overall health status as measured by SGRQ is better correlated with patient and physician assessments than FEV 1 . Breathlessness most often had the strongest correlations with primary outcomes, perhaps related to the chronic and troublesome nature of the sensation. Conclusion These data suggest that the smallest perceived change in patient status by overall patient assessment and physician global evaluation corresponds to a meaningful improvement in SGRQ scores, the magnitude of which supports an effect size of 4 units as clinically meaningful in a cohort of Japanese patient. Additionally, these data suggest that, in this clinical trial setting, the mean FEV 1 or FVC associated with the patient feeling better is less than the mean FEV 1 or FVC associated with the physician evaluation or patient impression.

The oesophageal catheter consisted of 9 consecutive recording electrode coils which formed 5 pairs of electrodes with an inter-electrode distance 3.2 cm within a recording pair. Each coil was 1 cm in length and the gap between adjacent coils was 0.5 mm. Maximal isometric contractions at functional residual capacity (FRC) and maximal voluntary inspirations from FRC to total lung capacity (TLC) were performed. All subjects underwent CO 2 rebreathing until end-tidal CO 2 was approximately 9% or they became intolerably breathless. Exhaustive treadmill exercise was performed at least 20 minutes after CO 2 rebreathing. There was a good linear relationship between root mean square of the diaphragm EMG (RMS) and end-tidal CO 2 (r = 0.92 \u00b1 0.06) during CO 2 rebreathing. The amplitude of the RMS increased initially and then reached a plateau during exercise.

Pathological changes of the lung in rats were observed and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), the expression of Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) were examined. Results Compared with group A, mean alveoli area (MAA), mean lung interval (MLI), expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in group B was significantly increased, but the ratio of MMP-9/TIMP-1 was unbalanced. Compared with group B, MAA, MLI, expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in group C were significantly decreased, while the ratio of MMP-9/TIMP-1 was balance. The PCNA index staining in group C was increased than that in group B.

            "text": "Background Respiratory muscles weakness can cause respiratory failure and contribute to weaning difficult in intensive care unit. Measurement of diaphragm compound muscle action potential (CMAP) provides useful information on diaphragm function. Conventional methodology for measurement of the diaphragm CMAP is electrical stimulation and chest wall surface electrode, which is potentially difficult to widely use in intensive care unit (ICU) because electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerve is technically demanding and the surface electrode can be unreliable in recording the diaphragm CMAP. Methods 10 normal subjects and 10 patients in ICU were studied. The diaphragm CMAP was measured with a multipair esophageal electrode during electrical and magnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerve. Results Good quality CMAP was recorded from both normal subjects and patients in ICU. In normal subjects, the phrenic nerve conduction time (PNCT) measured with electrical stimulation was similar to that measured with magnetic stimulation (7.4 \u00b1 0.9 ms vs 7.5 \u00b1 0.8 ms, P > 0.05 on the left side; 7.0 \u00b1 0.8 ms vs 6.9 \u00b1 0.8 ms, P > 0.05 on the right). The amplitude of the CMAP measured with electrical stimulation was also similar to that measured with magnetic stimulation (1.54 \u00b1 0.43 mV vs 1.61 \u00b1 0.41 mV, P > 0.05 on the left side; 1.49 \u00b1 0.39 mV vs 1.50 \u00b1 0.36 mV, P > 0.05 on the right). No CMAP response to magnetic stimulation was found on one side or both sides in three patients who had difficulty in weaning from mechanical ventilation. The amplitude of the CMAP in the patients who were able to respond to magnetic stimulation was smaller than that in the normal subjects (0.71 \u00b1 0.36 mV vs 1.58 \u00b1 0.38 mV, P < 0.001, pooled left and right values). Only one of the ten ICU patients had a prolonged PNCT. Conclusion This study suggests that magnetic stimulation is a useful technique in assessment of diaphragm function in ICU. Unilateral or bilateral diaphram paralysis contributes to difficulty in weaning from mechanical ventilation. We hypothesized that the vascular pedicle width on supine, portable chest X rays could be used to predict intravascular volume overloaded status in critically ill patients. We used pulmonary artery occlusion pressure measurements \u226518 mmHg as indicative of a fluid overloaded state and measurements <18 mmHg as normal/low volume states. Recognizing the limitations of the PAOP, this is still the standard invasive method of determining volume status in the intensive care unit and so was chosen as the reference standard. Traditionally invasive haemodynamic measurements of pulmonary artery occlusion pressures have been used to assess the volume status in critically ill patients. The vascular pedicle, as seen on chest X ray is the mediastinal silhouette of the great vessels. This can be measured by dropping a perpendicular line from the point at which the superior vena cava crosses the right mainstem bronchus across to the point where the left subclavian artery exits the aortic arch, This measurement is called the Vascular pedicle width, with a reported mean 'normal' value of 48 \u00b1 5 mm in healthy upright volunteers. Milne E, Pistolesi M et al. Radiology 1984;152:1-8. We hypothesized that the vascular pedicle width (VPW) on supine, portable chest X rays could be used to predict intravascular volume overloaded status in critically ill patients. We conducted a prospective, blinded trial where both pulmonary artery occlusion pressures and vascular pedicle widths were measured in patients admitted to the intensive care unit. We used pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) measurements \u226518 mmHg as indicative of a fluid overloaded state and measurements <18 mmHg as normal/low volume states. Standardized, portable chest X rays in the supine position were obtained within an hour of PAOP measurement. Receiver operating characteristics curves were constructed using different cutoffs of the vascular pedicle width measurement to identify sensitivities and specificities for each value. Measurements were obtained from forty-five patients. Using ROC derived cutoffs, a vascular pedicle width measurement of 72 mm was found to have a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 58% for correctly predicting a fluid overloaded state. These data suggest that the known correlations of VPW with intravascular volume in upright X rays may be extended to the portable X rays available in the intensive care unit.",

Unilateral or bilateral diaphram paralysis contributed to difficulty in weaning from mechanical ventilation. Objective To evaluate the severity of airflow obstruction in patients supported with mechanical ventilation and the effect on respiratory mechanics after salbutamol inhalation by analysis parameters of tidal breathing flow-volume curves (TBFV). Methods: 26 patients (age 67 \u00b1 5), intubated, sedated and mechanically ventilated at least 24 hour for acute respiratory failure of diverse causes (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD and asthma). After 20 mins with volume controlled ventilation (SIMV mode, tidal volume 7~9 ml/kg), Measurements of TBFV loops and respiratory mechanics [including compliance (Cst), airway resistance (Raw) and instrinic PEEP, (PEEPi)] were operated and repeated again after salbutamol 600 mg inhalation. Results: After salbutamol inhalation, all patients Raw was decreased significantly (21.9 \u00b1 2.4 cmH 2 O/L\u00b7s versus 13.1 \u00b1 1.8 cm H 2 O/L\u00b7s, P < 0.05), also PEEPi was lower from 6.9 \u00b1 1.2 cmH 2 O to 4.5 \u00b1 1.1 cmH 2 O(P < 0.05). peak tidal expiratory flow (PTEF) and the fraction of exhaled volume to achieve PTEF to V TE (V PTEF /V TE ) were increased slightly, but the fraction of exhaled time to achieve PTEF to T E (T PTEF /T E ), tidal expiratory flow at 50% of the remaining tidal volume/PTEF(TEF50/PTEF) and tidal expiratory flow at 25% of the remaining tidal volume/PTEF (TEF25/PTEF) were significant increased (P < 0.05). TEF50/PTEF, TEF25/PTEF had a significant correlation with PEEPi (r = 0.59 and 0.54, P < 0.05) than other TBFV parameters. The correlations were diminished lightly after salbutamol inhalation. Conclusions: The measurement of TBFV loops was simple and need not special technique, The degree of airflow obstruction and the effect of bronchodilator drug in mechanical ventilated patients could be known by analysis of TBFV parameters. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is used to treat hypoxemia associated with acute lung injury. We hypothesized that iNO may alter alveolar liquid clearance (ALC) in ventilated rabbits with lung injury induced by endotoxin. Eighteen rabbits were injected with endotoxin and ventilated 4 hours later. Volume control ventilation (Vt 15 ml/kg, f 40 bpm, PEEP 5 cm H 2 O) were given and all animals were randomly assigned into three groups: ventilation only, ventilation with iNO 40 ppm and ventilation with iNO 10 ppm. Three hours later isotonic albumin labeled by 125 I was injected into the right lower lobe and albumin labeled by 131 I into blood. 131 I radioactivity in plasma was detected as the baseline after ten minutes blood mixturing. One hour after injecting radionuclide, the radioactivity of 125 I and 131 I in alveolar liquid from right lower lobe and plasma were detected. Results were shown in table (W/D ratio means wet-to-dry lung weight ratio). We conclude that iNO can reduce lung edema by increasing ALC, and the low concentration NO inhalation may be more effective than high concentration in treatment of lung injury. Objective To determine whether hypercapnia is protective against oleic acid-induced acute lung injury (ALI) model. Moreover, to examine the effect of hypercapnia on NF-kB and TNF-a. Methods Twenty-two New Zealand rabbits were randomly allocated to control group (CON), normocapnic group (NC) and hypercapnic group (HP). The latter two groups were injected with oleic acid (0.1 ml/kg) intravenously to establish ALI model. Then TNF-a concentration in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and the expression of NF-kB in the lung tissue were analyzed. Lung mechanics, hemodynamics, blood-gas analysis indices and lung wet : dry ratio, BALF protein were measured. Histologic damage was assessed after 3 hours' mechanical ventilation.",

            "text": "Background There is a trend that the incidence of diffuse lung diseases (DLD) has been increasing in recent years. But China lacks a comprehensive survey until now. We analyze 395 subjects with DLD administrated in our hospital from 1990 to 2003 and hope it can contribute to a large-scale survey of DLD in China. On the other hand, we hope it can help Chinese doctors diagnosing these kinds of disease more correctly. Methods 395 patients (190 of male and 205 of female, mean age 56.09 \u00b1 12.98 years) who with diffused pathology on their conventional chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) scan and administrated in our hospital from 1990 to 2003 were all enrolled in the study. Their age, sex, professional, smoking or not, diagnosis, biopsy data, the number of hospitals that they ever administrated, how long they spend from initial to final diagnosis, the effect of therapy and other characteristics were analyzed. Results 1. The number of DLD patients administrated to our hospital and biopsy rate increased very evidently in recent 6 years, respectively 337 of 395 administrated cases and 92 of 102 biopsy cases. 2. The ratio of male to female was 0.93, but it varied according to different diseases, some kinds of disease have higher ratio, such as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) 1.87, diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) 1.5, respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease (RBILD) 1.33; other diseases have lower ratio, such as cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) 0.25, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) 0.29, sarcoidosis 0.36, connective tissue diseases 0.24. 3. The number of our patients increased with older age, such as 143 of 395 was over 60 yr (36.2%), 113 of them were 51 to 60 yr (28.6%), 80 of them were 41-50 yr (20.3%). 36 of 43 cases with UIP were over 50 yr (83.7%), 12 of 22 cases with NSIP were 41-50 yr (54.5%). 4. 142 subjects had some kinds of specific profession, such as 60 of 142 (42.3%) were peasants, 22 of 142 (15.49%) worked in textile mill. 5. 137 (34.7%) subjects were smoker and the diseases with higher smoking rate included lung cancer (72.7%), DPB (60%), RBILD (57.1%) and UIP (48.8%). 6. The effect of therapy were different with the kinds of DLD, 102 patients had surgical lung biopsy and their effect rate of therapy was 76.47% (78/102), but it varied with different diseases, some diseases had 100% of effect, included DIP, BOOP, RBILD, DPB and sarcoidosis, but NSIP was 84.2%, UIP just was 40%. 7. There were big differences among the time span from initial stage to final diagnosis, some less than one month, some over thirty years, middle time was thirteen months. The number of hospitals that they ever administrated varied from one to eight, average 2.7. Conclusion Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) expect UIP have better response to steroid therapy. Doctors have to understand ILD more clearly, diagnose more correctly and earlier. Idiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) is a distinct disease entity showing much better treatment response and long-term prognosis than usual interstitial pneumonia. Unfortunately little is known about the pattern of short-term clinical improvement and relapse of NSIP after completion of corticosteroid and/or cytotoxic therapy. Total 42 patients (mean age; 53.4 \u00b1 9.5 years, M : F = 7 : 35) with idiopathic NSIP, proved by surgical lung biopsy between July 1997 and July 2003, were retrospectively reviewed. Treatment responses after starting treatment were assessed at 3rd month and 6th month. If the patients met any two of following three criteria, they were considered to show a favorable response:",

Employees who worked here have often suffered from cough, sputum and shortness of breath. This study aimed to clarify the clinical features and therapy of this disease. Methods Fifteen patients had mild respiratory symptoms of dry cough, sputum, and low-grade fever. We diagnosed them as HP from clinical features, HRCT findings, BALF findings, lung histology, and lymphocyte stimulation test (LST) for Bunashimeji. Five of 15 patients ('avoidance') quit their job to avoid exposure to spores after hospitalization. As the therapies, Fifteen patients were divided into two subgroups; 'mask alone' (3 patients) and treatment with prednisolone orally with mask ('mask+PSL', 7 patients) for 2 months. Results PFTs revealed a slight decrease in the percentage diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide. Four of 15 patients showed normal findings on the chest X-ray, but HRCT findings of all patients showed diffuse groundglass opacities with centrilobular nodules. BALF revealed an increase in total cell counts, showing predominantly activated lymphocytes. The results of the LST were positive in all cases. The 'avoidance resulted in a significant decrease in LST (P < 0.05). In all groups, chest HRCT showed partial disappearance of the ground glass opacity and the presence of small nodules in the short-term. Total cell counts in BALF of the 'mask+PSL' group significantly decreased after treatment compared with the 'avoidance' and 'mask alone' groups (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively).",

These cases corresponded to the Standard of Diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis compiled by the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan based on environmental factors, positive serum precipitin against Saccharopolyspora rectivulgura or Thermoactinomyces vulgaris and pathological findings of lung biopsy. The patients' age was 56.2 \u00b1 6.79 years (44 to 63) at acute onset. All patients showed improved Symptoms, chest X-ray and CT findings and attained remission through hospitalized treatment. After 10 to 20 years (14.8 \u00b1 4.90), we conducted follow up survey. All patients were still engaged in dairy farming. All subjects never smoked. Results All of the 6 cases showed abnormal chest CT such as small bullae, fine nodules, fine granular shadows, ground-glass opacity or emphysematous changes. One showed honeycombing. Conclusion Even if acute symptoms of farmer's lung improve, chronic exposure to antigens has the risk to induce fibrosis and emphysematous changes of lungs. Bronchiolitis Obliterans (BO), a clinico-pathologic diagnosis of bronchiolar inflammation and fibrosis with pregressive dyspnea, occurs commonly in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) de novo or as a complication of Dpenicillamine treatment. Bucillamine, another disease modifying antirheumatic drug similar to D-penicillamine in molecular structure in that both contain a sulfhydryl group, has been reported to be associated with lung injury. None of these lung injuries were BO to our knowledge. 57 year-old female was diagnosed of seronegative RA, and was treated with 200 mg of bucillamine daily from December 2000. Three months later, she presented complaining of cough, mucoid sputum and exertional dyspnea. Chest x-ray revealed reticular opacities on both lung fields. HRCT showed peribronchial fibrosis with bronchial wall thickening, bronchiectasis, bronchioloectasis and some centrilobular nodules with branching linear pattern in both lung fields. Lung biopsy by video-assisted thoracic surgery showed marked thickening of peribronchioles with extensive proliferation of smooth muscle and narrowing of bronchiolar lumina, which are consistent with constrictive bronchiolitis. Bucillamine was discontinued, and the patient improved symptomatically and radiologically on serial chest X rays. We believe that this is the first report of bucillamine-induced bronchiolitis obliterans pathologically proven. Larger scale study will offer more insight to this condition.",

Conclusion Most IFBs are retrievable by fibreoptic bronchoscopy. Difficulties may occur due to late presentation or to the site/position of IFB. Under GA, bronchoscopy through laryngeal mask airway may make ventilation easier by providing a wider calibre than the endotracheal tube. Backgrounds & Objectives Bronchoscopic intervention in patients with malignant central airway obstruction provides the best ability to maintain airway control as well as initial palliation and stabilization of the airway, allow the possibility of other more effective therapeutic modalities such as surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. To describe advantage and limitation of emergency rigid bronchoscopic intervention as a bridge to subsequent treatment, we reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent airway intervention because of respiratory failure due to malignant central airway obstruction. Subject & Methods Retrospective review of medical records of 36 patients (26 males, median age 62 years) who underwent emergency airway intervention because of respiratory failure due to malignant central airway obstruction at Samsung Medical Center from January 1999 through December 2003. Results Thirty-four of 36 patients (94.4%) had an improved airway after bronchoscopic intervention. Only one patient required immediate repeat bronchoscopy after the initial successful intervention. After stabilization of airway, twenty-one of 33 patients (58.3%) could have several forms of additional therapy; surgical resection in 9, radiation in 10, combined radiation and chemotherapy in 2 patients. Fifteen patients (41.7%) had no additional therapy. Mean survival time in patients who had additional therapy after emergency rigid bronchoscopy was 38.2 months (range 1.7 to 57.0 months), however, mean survival was 6.2 months (range to 0.1 to 33.7 months) in patients who had no additional therapy. Conclusions Bronchoscopic intervention should be considered even in patients with life threatening respiratory failure due to malignant central airway obstruction for providing opportunity to be performed appropriate therapy for long term survival. Objectives To assess the effects and safety of balloon dilatation using a fiberoptic bronchoscope in the management of benign tracheobronchial stenosis. Methods One hundred and fourteen patients of proximal benign tracheobronchial stenosis were managed by balloon using the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope. Each patient under-went fiberoptic bronchoscopy, in which a balloon catheter was sent to stenosis segment from the working channel and positioned across the stenosis. Under direct visualization, the balloon was inflated for 1 to 3 min. Repeat inflation-deflation cycles were done if airway narrowing remained after the initial attempt. At preprocedure and last postprocedure days, airway diameters, dyspnea index and complications were evaluated in all of the patients and FEV 1 was tested in 58 cases. Results All of the patients required 1 to 8 sessions, mean 3.22 \u00b1 1.24 sessions. After high pressure balloon dilatations, airway average diameter increased from 2.74 \u00b1 1.32 mm to 6.87 \u00b1 1.76 mm (X \u00b1 S) (P < 0.01). Dyspnea index decreased from 2.13 \u00b1 0.81 to 0.71 \u00b1 0.56 (P < 0.01). FEV 1 in the 58 cases's increased from 1.32 \u00b1 0.62 L to 1.81 \u00b1 1.22 L (P < 0.01). No severe complication was found in 114 ptients. Conclusion Airwayplasty of high pressure balloon dilation using flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope is an efficient, safe, simple and rapid method to treat proximal benign tracheobronchial stenosis. Objective To evaluate the efficiency and safety about the bronchial occlusive device of NiTi alloy after being implanted into experimental healthy dogs. Methods The NiTi alloy wire was weaved into varied shapes, such as cast-like, mushroom-like, dumbbell-like and Korean drum-like shapes, and a screw was fixed at the end of it. 24 healthy dogs were divided into four groups and inserted with metal tracheal cannulas. Fibrobronchoscope was inserted through the cannula. After the target location was determined, Guiding wire was sent through the biopsy channel of the bronchoscope, and catheter was then sent along the guiding wire. By the supervision of fluoroscopy and bronchoscopy, implanting device with four kinds of occlusive device at the top was sent respectively into the target location through the catheter of four groups. The changes in the location of occlusive device, bronchial tissue around and in the distal part of it, other key viscera and the occlusive device themselves were determined at the first, third, fifth and eighth week. Results 48 pieces of occlusive device were implanted successfully into dogs at the first time. During eight weeks of observation, 14 pieces of occlusive device (29.16%) displaced or shed. Among them were 2 cast-like, 7 mushroom-like, 5 dumbbell-like device. While all the Korean drum-like occlusive device didn't displaced or shed. Bronchial tissue around the occlusive device was in acute inflammatory reaction at the first week and epithelia began to proliferate at the third week; At the fifth week, epithelia covered the device totally, and distal lung tissue collapsed obviously; at the eighth week, inflammation disappeared and distal lung tissue collapsed totally. There is no obvious obstructive pneumonia in the distal lung tissue during the observation period. After observation, shedding occlusive device was taken out, and no obvious deformation, erosion or rupture was found. Conclusion This bronchial occlusive device of NiTi alloy and its implanting system, which were designed and made in our study, are characterized by accurate localization and easy implantation. In the four different shapes, the Korean drum-like occlusive device has the best effect and satisfactory histocompatibility and we expected it to be used in bronchial closure safely and effectively.",

Method This study was prospectively conducted and performed over a 1-year period in a national medical center. Univariate and multivariate analyses were applied to evaluate those factors. Patients who had pulmonary nodule or mass but no endobronchial lesions underwent FOB with transbonchial biopsy (TBB) and bronchial brushing (BB) under fluoroscopic guidance. Results We studied 69 patients, 52 with malignant tumors and 17 with benign lesions. The diagnostic rate by TBB and BB through FOB for all lesions was 69.6%. There was no significant difference in diagnostic yield between malignant (67.3%) and benign lesions (76.5%). The diagnostic rates of TBB and BB were 50.7% and 52.2%, respectively. TBB and BB were complementary in improving diagnostic rate (P < 0.001). The diagnostic yield of FOB was tightly associated with the size (the diameter > versus \u00a31.8 cm; P = 0.023) and localization (good versus poor; P < 0.001) of the lesion, but not its distance from the tip of FOB. Lesions of the right upper lobe and lesions with no CT bronchus sign were more difficult to be localized and approached by the diagnostic tools. Conclusions We have found that the diagnostic yield of combined TBB and BB through FOB for SPN or lung mass was higher than either one procedure alone. Size of the lesion and good lesion localization during the procedure were important determinants of diagnostic yield in FOB. Good lesion localization was closely related to the location and the presence of CT bronchus sign of the lesion. Alternative diagnostic approaches should be considered for lesions under 1.8 cm in diameter that are located in the right upper lobe with no CT bronchus sign. Background Obstruction of the airways due to malignant disease is a frightening condition that portends poor prognosis. Emergency airway stenting can quickly palliate and relieve the obstruction. We retrospectively analysed our data on the management of these patients.

The diagnoses were as follows: NSCLC (7), adenoid cystic carcinoma (1), small cell lung cancer (1), Hodgkin's lymphoma (1) and malignant thymoma (1). A total of 15 airway stents were inserted consisting of 2 tracheal stents, 7 left bronchial stents and 6 right bronchial stents (6 covered/5 uncovered ultraflex stents and 4 polyflex stents). All patients had immediate symptomatic relief. Follow up is as follows: 6 patients died within a year of stent insertion from their underlying malignancy, 2 were transferred back to their respective countries and were lost to follow up, the 3 remaining patients are still being follow up by the oncologist. The patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma had regression of her disease with chemotherapy and is well 2.5 years after stent placement. Conclusion Malignant airway obstruction from extrinsic or intrinsic causes can be managed by urgent palliative airway stenting, which provide instant relief in an otherwise fatal condition. Their outcome however is still poor and is determined by their underlying malignant disease. Background Hypoxia is an acknowledged feature of most solid tumor. The ability of tumors to adapt to a hypoxic microenvironment is increasingly recognized as an important mechanism that promotes tumor growth. Hypoxia inducible factor-1(HIF-1) is a transcriptional factor that is important in regulating the expression of various genes that are overexpressed in the presence of cellular hypoxia. These genes include the hematopoietic growth factor erythropoietin, angiogenic growth factors, and genes involved in glucose transport and metabolism. HIF-1 is a heterodimer composed of HIF-1a and HIF-1b subunits. HIF-1b (also known as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator) is a common subunit of multiple BHLH-PAS proteins, whereas HIF-1a is unique, O 2 -regulated subunit that determines HIF-1 activity. Despite intense investigation of HIF-1 in human common tumors, little has been learned about the effects of HIF-1 on lung cancer. Methods 1. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) technique was employed to detect the protein expressions of HIF-1a, P53 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in specimens from 57 patients with lung cancer. 2. To sift the A549 cells which can express HIF-1a stablely, HIF-1a mRNA was amplified by RT-PCR and inserted into plasmid pcDNA3. A549 cells were sifted with G418, after the expression plasmid pcDNA3/HIF-1a transfected into A549 through Lipofect2000. 3. The effect of HIF-1a on tumor growth in vitro was evaluated by the growth curve and subcutaneous implanted tumors of nude mice in vivo. A549 cells (1 \u00a5 10 6 /mouse) were inoculated subcutaneously into 20 nude mice, which were randomly divided into two groups: the control group (group A, n = 10), the HIF-1a transfected group (group B, n = 10). The weights of subcutaneous tumor were detected. The resected specimens were made into paraffinembedded sections. The Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) was identified by IHC. The expressions of HIF-1a, apoptosis-related protein survivin and bcl-2 were analyzed by Western-blot. 4. To evaluate HIF-1a on tumor chemotherapy resistance, 5-Fu was added into A549 after HIF-1a transfected, the growth activity was measured by growth curve, apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry, at 48 h, the levels of caspase3 and mdr1 were found by Western-blot. 5. To study the role and mechanisms of HIF-1a silence on the growth and tumorigenicity of lung cancer cells A549, the antisense oligonucleotide of HIF-1a was transfected to A549 cells. The effect of the antisense oligonucleotide on tumor growth in vitro and in vivo was evaluated by the growth rate suppression of A549 cells and subcutaneous implanted tumor in nude mice, and the effect on tumorigenicity was evaluated by the expression inhibition of angiogenic factors, the microvessel density (MVD) and VEGF protein expression which were detected by IHC and Western blot respectively. Results 1. The results indicated that the total positive proportion of HIF-1a expression was 63% and the HIF-1a expression was more frequent in bronchiole-alveolar carcinoma (86%) than in other lung cancer.",

The expression plasmid was transfected into cultured A549 cells through Lipofect2000, the expression of HIF-1a protein detected by Western-blot was significant increased. 3. The growth rates of the HIF-1a transfected lung cancer cells A549 were significantly increased, and more importantly, the HIF-1a transfected lung cancer cells A549 were able to enhance lung cancer growth in nude mice (P < 0.05). The PCNA were increased significantly in group B when compared with group A. The expressions of HIF-1a, survivin and bcl-2 in group B were increased significantly than that of group A. 4.

Background Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) was first identified as a B-cell nuclear factor and given its name on the basis of its ability to bind to an intronic enhancer of immunoglobulin k-light chain gene. Since then, NF-kB has been identified in numerous cell types and is found to be activated by a wide range of inducers, including ultraviolet irradiation, cytokines, inhaled occupational particles, and bacterial or viral products. In resting cells, NF-kB resides in the cytoplasm in an inactive from bound to an inhibitory protein known as IkB. Upon cellular activation by extracellular stimuli. IkB is phosphorylated and proteolytically degraded or processed by proteasomes and other proteases. This proteolytic process activates NF-kB, which then translocates into the nucleus. In nuclei, NF-kB can initiate or regulate early-response gene transcription by binding to decameric motifs, 'GGGRNNYYCC (kB motif)', found in the promoter or enhancer regions of specific genes. NF-kB binding sites have been identified in the promoter regions of genes whose products are intimately involved in tumor cells apoptosis and proliferation. We hypothesized that the transfection of a sufficient quantity of decoy oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) containing the NF-kB cis element into lung cancer cells A549 would effectively bind NF-kB, thus influence A549 cells growth and apoptosis. Methods First, the lung cancer cells (A549) were divided into three groups: group A (control group); group B (decoy ODN group) and group C (scramble decoy ODN group). FITC-labeled NF-kB decoy ODN was transfected into A549 with LipofectAMINE TM 2000, the activation was observed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), the proliferation was observed by growth curve, the apoptosis of cells were observed by flow cytometry and TdT mediated dUTP-biotin Nick End Labeling (TUNEL), the expression of bcl-2 and fas were observed by Western blot. Second, When ciglitazone was added, the proliferation was observed by growth curve and the differentiation of cells was observed by flow cytometry, the expressions of cyclinD1 and MDR1 were observed by Western blot.",

Drug sensitivity was determined by MTT assay; Several multidrug resistant related proteins including P-gp, MRP-1, LRP, GST-p, TOPOII and P53 were checked by immunocytotochemistry. P53 protein was detected by Western-blot. Immunofluorescence was used to assess the extent of P53 phosphoration. p53cDNA from H460/cDDP was amplified and sequenced, then compared with the wild type p53 from H460 cells. Amino acid sequence and the structure of the mutated P53 protein were predicted by bioinformation methods (Gene Tool and Swiss-PDB viewer softwares). 96 genes at p53 signaling pathway were detected by gene chip array. H460/cDDP was transfected by the Pshuttle-CMV-wtP3 plasmide. MTT assay was used for evaluating the efficacy of the transfected wtp53 on the drug sensitivity. H460/cDDP and the sensitive parental cells H460 were transplanted subcutaneously to nude mice. A recombination of adenovirus and wild-type p53 (Ad-p53) alone or combining with cisplatin was injected to nude mice to evaluate the anti-tumor and their reversing effect of drug resistance. Results Drug-resistant H460/cDDP cell line developed after 6 months of cisplatin selection. Resistance indices to cisplatin and carboplatin in H460/cDDP cell line were 10.21 and 9.98 respectively. At the same time, the cell line also exhibited moderate resistance to 5-Fuorouracil, etoposide, methotrexate, adriamycin, epirubicin, bleomycin and navelbine, except for taxol. P53 protein was found positive in the H460/cDDP cell but translocated from nuclear to cytoplasm. The velocity of P53 protein electrophoresis varied from that of H460 and showed no phosphoration by cisplatin stimulation. In addition, there was stronger expression of LRP but not other protein in H460/cDDP cells. Sequencing of p53cDNA of H460/cDDP showed an insertion 't' after site 277. The mutated P53 protein, with 39 amino acids lost in the N-terminal, was coded from site 370 for the insert 't' after site 277, resulting to the loss of the MDM2 binding site and Serine15 phosphorylation site. Gene chip array for 96 related genes at the p53 signaling pathway showed that P53AIP1, c-myc, PKCa, PKCb, and 6 other genes were expressed in H460/cDDP, but not in its parental cells. MDM2, NUMB and EP300 that regulating p53 expression increased by 4-8 folds in the multi-drug resistant cells. p53 modification genes KIP2 and MAP2K4 were also 10 folds up-regulated also. As an apoptosis regulator and cell-cycle controller at the downstream of p53, LRDD expressed 10.89 folds higher in H460/cDDP. DNA repair gene GADD45A was 4.68-fold higher. There were few genes such as ABCB1, CASP9 and TNFALP1 appeared to be down-regulated in the drug resistant cells, but showed no significant difference as compared with the parental cells. The resistance to cisplatin was partly reversed (53.2%) when H460/cDDP cells were transfected with the Pshuttle-CMV-wtP3 plasmide. With regards to the effect on the tumor grafts, Ad-p53 in combining with the cisplatin demonstrated better inhibition effect than either one single administration. The inhibition effect on the multi-drug resistant cells was about the same as that on the sensitive parental cells. ",

Methods Tumor specimens were obtained during diagnostic or surgical procedures, including trans-bronchoscopy lung biopsy, metastatic bone tumor biopsy, thoracentesis cells of malignant pleural effusion, and surgical lung tumor samples. Mutations in the EGFR gene (exons 17 to 24) in tumors from patients with NSCLC were searched. Results Mutations were identified in 2 of 11 patients (2 squamous cell carcinoma and 9 adenocarcinoma), one of which was 15 bp deletion in exon 19 and the other was L858R in exon 21.

            "text": "We found that the selective COX-2 inhibitors NS398 and Nimesulide decreased mRNA expression and protein production of the a5 subunit of the integrin. This effect was associated with inhibition of NSCLC cell adhesion to fibronectin. The COX-2 inhibitors triggered the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) in a time-dependent manner, and the inhibitor of Erk PD98095 prevented their inhibitory effects on a5 expression. Transient transfection assays showed that the COX-2 inhibitors affected a5 gene transcription by acting between -92 to-41 bp of the human a5 gene promoter. Gel mobility shift assays showed that the COX-2 inhibitors increased Sp1 DNA binding, but decreased that of AP-1. These effects were accompanied by an increase in Sp1 protein and a decrease in c-Jun protein expression, as well as inhibition of SAPK/JNK phosphorylation. The Sp1 inhibitor, Mithramycin A, also blocked the inhibitory effect of the COX-2 inhibitors on a5 expression and promoter activity. Conclusion These findings suggest that COX-2 inhibitors suppress a5b1 integrin expression in NSCLC through effects on a5 gene transcription mediated by Erk activation, increased Sp1, decreased AP-1 DNA binding, and inactivation of SAPK/JNK signals. Together, our observations unveil a new mechanism of action against NSCLC for COX-2 inhibitors that relates to regulation of a5 gene expression and, consequently, recognition of extracellular matrices (i.e., fibronectin) by tumor cells. Background Tumor stage and its histological subtype remain the most important predictors of clinical behavior in current pulmonary practice of lung cancer. However, many investigators agree that these parameters are not sufficient to predict which tumor will recur, even after radical curative surgery. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the significance of other morphological, biological and molecular parameters beyond TNM classification.",

Molecular biologic staging is the assessment of tumor markers that are assessed to detect the presence of occult metastases in lymph nodes to improve the risk stratification provided by comventional TNM stageing. The aim of this study was to diagnose occult micrometastasis of mediastinal lymph node in NSCLC patients and assess molecular biologic staging and evaluate its prognostic significance. Conclusion CEAmRNA, P53 and AE1/AE3 expression provide prognostic information, allowing a more accurate outcome prediction for the individual patient, but were not independent prognostic factors. The value of lymph node micrometastasis and molecular biologic substaging for prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer is undefined. The best prognostic index for operable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the TNM staging system. Molecular biology holds the promise of predicting outcome for the individual patient. These data suggest that molecular analysis allows a more accurate assessment of staging. However, larger studies are needed to determine the clinical role of molecular staging.",

The main chemical components of green tea are green tea polyphenols (GTP), which are responsible for the anticancer activity of green tea. There are many mechanisms concerning GTP's effects, but none of them could completely explain GTP's wide anticancer activities. It is well known that the growths of all solid tumors depend on angiogenesis, without neovascularization, the primary tumor would not reach the size of 1-2 mm 3 . GTP's antiangiogenesis activity has been demonstrated in vitro. So it is reasonable to surmise that GTP may inhibit tumor angiogenesis in vivo. Methods Lewis lung carcinoma was employed as the model to study the antiangiogenesis activity of GTP by using the methods of immunohistochemstry. C57BL/6J mouse were divided into six groups randomly, two control groups and four treatment groups. The latter were orally administered GTP 62.5, 125, 250, 125 mg/kg d -1 respectively 24 hours after implantation. At day 13 and 23, mouse were killed seperately to study tumors' angiogenesis and metastasis. VEGF, C-Jun, PCNA and MVD were measured immunohistochemically.

Method A retrospective descriptive cohort of 27 patients using home bipap during the period from the year 2000 to 2004 was studied. All patients were under the care of a single district general hospital in HK. All underwent manual bipap titration with full PSG in the sleep laboratory for the determination of optimum bipap pressure that achieved optimal oxygen saturation and sleep quality. Their presentations, demographic data, sleep architectures, arterial blood gas during stable phase before and after bipap are described. Mann Whitney Test and Wilconxon Signed Ranks test are used for statistic analysis. Figures are quoted as mean \u00b1 2 SD. Result 13 patients were found to have both obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). 2 patients had OHS alone. 5 patients had both OSA and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 5 patients had COPD alone. 2 patients had neuromuscular problems 2 . For COPD patients, majority of them presented with type II respiratory failure with frequent repeated admission and difficult weaning. OHS was suspected when obese patients (BMI \u0d1c 25) with hypercapnic respiratory failure could not be explained by other concomitant disease after investigations including HRCT thorax, echocardiogram, lung function test and VQ scan were performed as appropriate. For patients with OHS, the mean age was 58 \u00b1 18 year old, mean body weight was 87 \u00b1 32 kg, mean abdominal girth was 117 \u00b1 19 cm, mean BMI was 34 \u00b1 9 and mean RDI was 63 \u00b1 32/hr. For patients without OHS, mean age was 65 \u00b1 8.7 years, mean body weight was 61 \u00b1 18 kg, mean abdominal girth was 116 \u00b1 15 cm, mean BMI was 26 \u00b1 7.9 and mean RDI was 21 \u00b1 16/hr. BMI, RDI and body weight between two groups were statistically significantly different (P = 0.037, 0.028 and 0.016 respectively). As a whole group, mean REM sleep duration before bipap was 16 \u00b1 24.5 min, after bipap was 46 \u00b1 48.5 min (P = 0.046). CO2 level before bipap was 8.6 \u00b1 2.7 KPa, after bipap was 7.5 \u00b1 1.6 kPa (P = 0.055). Hospital stay before bipap was 13.2 \u00b1 20 days, while after bipap it was shortened to 2.9 \u00b1 5.6 days (P = 0.025). The mean inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) was 18 \u00b1 4 cm water and mean expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) was 11.8 \u00b1 5.6 cm water. Conclusion A high proportion of patients using home bipap was found to have features of OHS. They were associated with severe OSA with higher RDI, higher BMI and higher body weight. Apart from COPD, hypercapnic respiratory failure with frequent hospital admissions was found to be a frequent presentation of in-hospital patients with OHS. Therefore further investigation to exclude OHS in this group of patients is warranted. COPD and OHS comprise the major disease category in this bipap cohort 2 . Utilization of bipap improved sleep architecture and arterial blood gas significantly and this has also been shown in another study 3 . Reduction of hospital admissions is also consistent with the finding of other study 4 .",

One of them is auto-triggering, which means the ventilator is triggered neither by the patient's inspiratory effort nor by the preset ventilator frequency. This study explored the relationship between air leak and auto-triggering in NIPPV. A quantificational air leak model was set up. The volume of air leak was set as 4 levels, the 1 st level: baseline (only the air leak from the ventilator's expiratory port, 10-30 L/min), the 2 nd level (19-23 L/min air leak adding baseline), the 3 rd level (38-46 L/min air leak adding baseline) and the 4 th level (60-67 L/min air leak adding baseline).

One was diagnosed as having paragonimiasis, from thoracoscopic findings and clinical consideration. There was no procedure-associated mortality. There were six cases of new onset fever (40%) and one case of pneumothorax (6.7%). Two millimeter minithoracoscopy which is less invasive than conventional thoracoscopy was an accurate and safe method for undiagnosed exudative pleural effusion. Carcinoma of the lung was the commonest cause of malignant effusions and bronchoscopic biopsy gave the highest yield of histological diagnosis (66%), followed by pleural fluid cytology (59%) and pleural biopsy (50%). The combination of these three procedures increased the diagnostic yield to 96%. In tuberculous pleural effusion, pleural fluid staining for acid-fast bacilli staining was negative in all cases but mycobacterial culture was positive in 24% of cases while pleural biopsy gave a better yield of 68%. Examination of sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens confirmed the diagnosis of tuberculosis in 40% of cases. A combination of these investigations yielded the diagnosis in 92% of patients with tuberculous effusion. Conclusions Pleural fluid analysis, pleural biopsy and fibreoptic bronchoscopy are helpful in diagnosing tuberculous and neoplastic effusions due to carcinoma of the lung. We describe a case of a 39 year old male who was admitted in our hospital due to persistent bleeding from the biopsy site done on the right breast mass. Our patient presented with tuberculosis-like symptomatology, a breast mass mimicking a hemangioma and on chest CT scan, an empyema-like density with extrathoracic extension. He underwent open thoracotomy and chest wall reconstruction. Histopathologic examination revealed epithelioid angiosarcoma. The tumor cells showed positive staining for CD34 and Factor VIII and were negative for smooth muscle actin. Our patient is currently on his 6th month post surgery. Though functionally well, the note of tumor recurrence and presence of adenopathies signal a bad prognosis. To our knowledge, this is the first case of its kind reported in our country. Primary thoracic epithelioid angiosarcoma is an extremely rare neoplasm with only a few cases reported thus far in the international literature. This highly aggressive tumor, which may arise in various sites, is part of the continuum of the family of epithelioid vascular tumors. Recurrence and behavior of this tumor is unpredictable. It carries a dismal prognosis. No single effective therapy has yet been established, though a combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, as well as immunotherapy have been tried with variable results. Although uncommon, primary intrathoracic angiosarcoma must always remain in the differential diagnosis of pleural and subpleural masses in the presence of pulmonary ascites, nodules, diffuse infiltrates and an opacified lung.",

            "text": "Objectives To identify the expression of AQP 1 in visceral and parietal pleura in SD rat and to examine the effect of AQP 1 in pleural fluid turnover. Methods Pleural membranes were carefully microdissected from normal SD rats. Immunohistochemistry was done using specific goat polyclonal antibodies. SD rats were divided into five groups, including control group (normal saline, n = 8), dexamethasone group (n = 24), erythromycin group (n = 24), hyper osmotic NaCl group (n = 24), and lipopolysaccharide group (n = 24). Agents were intrapleural injected. Pleural tissues were homogenized in Trizol for mRNA isolation. Real time RT-PCR was carried out with AQP 1 gene-specific primers. Results AQP 1 was immunolocalized predominantly to the microvessels and mesothelial cells of visceral and parietal pleura. The extent of AQP 1 expression in parietal pleura was less than that in visceral pleura. AQP 1 expression increased at all phases in dexamethasone group and hyper osmotic NaCl group, whereas it decreased in erythromycin group and lipopolysaccharide group. Conclusion Enhanced expression of AQP 1 may relate to more absorption in pleural effusion by dexamethasone. Rapid osmotic equilibration across the pleural surface is facilitated by AQP 1 . Both erythromycin and lipopolysaccharide downregulated AQP 1 expression suggests a possible mechanism for AQP 1 modulation by inflammatory cytokines. Our experiment provides indirect evidence that AQP 1 may play a role in the pleural fluid turnover. However, animal model of pleural effusion under conditions of stress (i.e. TB, bacteria, virus etc), AQP 1 gene knockout animal and inhibitor of AQP 1 are needed to confirm the role of AQP 1 in pleural fluid transport. Polymerase chain reaction Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a common method of creating copies of specific fragments of DNA. PCR rapidly amplifies a single DNA molecule into many billions of molecules and can be detected by visualization. Setting Diagnostic of pleural effusion caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis is still a clinical problem especially of low sensitivity in conventional methods. Objective To evaluate PCR technique based on IS6110 sequence detection of M. tuberculosis in pleural fluid. Material and method Subjects: A total of 62 pleural fluid samples of highly suspected pleurisy tuberculosis outpatient and inpatient of Persahabatan Hospital, Jakarta. Diagnosis made based on microscopically, microbiological and histopathological finding. Each sample was examined microscopic examination with auramin and Ziehl-Neelsen stain, culture in solid and liquid media, pleural biopsy for histopathology examination, PCR with E1 and E2 primer. Gold standard criteria for pleurisy tuberculosis were positive if one or more examination positive (microscopic, culture, histopathology). DNA was extracted with Boom method. Primer E1 and E2 were used and amplified to 123 bp of IS6110. Sample was exclude if the culture grew mycobacteria other than tuberculosis. Results PCR was a rapid diagnostic test and can detect DNA of M. tuberculosis in pleural fluid specimen with sensitivity 54.35%, specificity 93.75%, positive predicted value 96.15%, negative predicted value 41.67%, false positive 1 (1.61%), false negative 21 (33.87%) (c 2 = 11,278, P = 0.001). Sensitivity of direct stain AFB, culture and pleural biopsy were 12.77%, 23.40%, 96.55% and the specificity were 100%, 100%, 45.45% respectively. Quality control of laboratory, primer used, contaminant and dead bacilli were influenced factors of PCR result. Conclusions PCR has higher diagnostic value of pleurisy tuberculosis compared with AFB microscopy, culture but lower than pleural biopsy, however it should be carefully implemented with patient's clinical condition. Keyword: pleuritis tuberculosis, polymerase chain reaction, diagnostic Background The intrapleural injection of transforming growth factor-beta2 (TGF-b 2 ) or doxycycline produces excellent pleurodesis in rabbit model. However, the intrapleural injection of these agents induces large pleural effusion which is possibly related to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The aim of this study was to investigate whether anti-VEGF antibody has any effect on the fluid production or the pleurodesis induced by TGF-b 2 or doxycycline in rabbits. Methods Two groups of 8 New Zealand white rabbits were given doxycycline 10 mg/kg intrapleurally after chest tube placement. The doxycycline treatment group received 10 mg/kg anti-VEGF antibody intravenously 24 h before doxycycline injection and the doxycycline control group received no Anti-VEGF antibody. Another two groups of 8 New Zealand white rabbits were given TGF-b 2 5.0 mg intrapleurally. The TGF-b 2 treatment group received anti-VEGF antibody 10 mg/kg intravenously 24 hours before TGF-b 2 injection and the TGF-b 2 control group received no antibody. The rabbits were sacrificed at 2 weeks and the pleurodesis score was graded macroscopically on a 1-8 scale. The degree of angiogenesis in pleural tissues was assessed by immunohistochemical staining for factor VIII which was assessed by computer-assisted digital analysis.",

IL-8 is a potent chemoattractant that accounts for the neutrophilic influx seen in the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis. Mechanisms regulating IL-8 expression have been shown to involve protein kinase C (PKC) activation. In this study we investigated the effects of pyocyanin, alone and in combination, with IL-1b and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) on IL-8 mRNA and release in the human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B) by reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RT-PCR and ELISA showed that pyocyanin alone produced no increase in IL-8 mRNA or IL-8 release. However, pyocyanin caused significant potentiation in IL-8 release triggered by IL-1b and PDBu in a dose-dependent manner without affecting IL-8 mRNA levels. Incubation with dexamethasone, budesonide, fluticasone, and erythromycin caused dosedependent suppression of IL-8 release stimulated by pyocyanin plus IL-1b or PDBu. Budesonide and fluticasone were 10-fold more potent than dexamethasone in the inhibition whilst erythromycin exerted its effect at a much higher dose starting at 0.3 mM. Our findings suggest that potentiation of cytokine-or PDBu-induced IL-8 release by pyocyanin may be due to post-transcriptional mechanisms. These data confirm the established role of glucocorticosteroids, and erythromycin as anti-inflammatory action in treating bronchiectasis. Objective To investigate the in vivo efficacies of ceftazidime and cefepime in rats with experimental pneumonia due to extended-spectrum b-lactamaseproducing strain of Klebsiella pneumonia sus ceptible to either of the antibiotics in vitro.

The electron microscopy and flow cytometry analysis were analyzed and the bacteriology, pathology, cytokines in the lung of mice with IPA were valued. Results DCs can engulf aspergillus conidia through coiling phagocytosis and then mature. Transfection of DCs with adenovirus did not affect their capacity to engulf conidia. Adoptive transfer of DCs pulsed ex vivo with heat-inactivated Af (HAF) to naive mice induced the Ag-specific production of IFN-g, and transfection of these DCs augmented this immune response.

            "text": "Introduction Central sleep apnea (CSA) is a disorder with a variable clinical presentation. Polysomnographically, CSA is characterized by recurrent episodes of absent/decreased respiratory effort during sleep. Abnormalities in gain of metabolic ventilatory control system or circulatory abnormalities may contribute to unstable, periodic ventilation during sleep. Acetazolamoide (ACET) is known to potentiate the ventilatory response to chemical stimuli and to alter brain blood flow. Likely, via one or both these mechanisms, ACET has been found to improve sleep-induced periodic breathing and central sleep apnea. Worsening of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has also been reported with ACET. In addition, previous studies indicate that a heightened ventilatory drive may contribute to OSA. Based on these concepts, we hypothesized that in patients, primarily with CSA but with mild OSA, CSA would be improved and OSA worsened by ACET. Methods Patients were selected with a Central AH index \u22655/h and OSA index \u00a35/hr. Central Apnea/Hypopnea was defined as a >80%/>50% reduction in oral/nasal flow, accompanied by a proportional thoracic and abdominal decrease in effort measured by thoracic and abdominal strain gauges. OSA was defined as obstructive AH index \u22655/h and central AH index \u00a35/h. Obstructive apnea/hypopnea was defined as reduction in oral/nasal flow, accompanied by persistence or an increase in thoracic and abdominal effort. In an open label, prospective study of 8 patients diagnosed with CSA, ACET 250 mg orally bid was administered for 6 weeks, followed by repeat polysomnogram (PSG) in the last week of therapy.",

Central apnea index (16 \u00b1 16 vs. 2 \u00b1 3 P = 0.0001) and Central hypopnea index (20 \u00b1 15 vs. 3 \u00b1 4 P = 0.019) improved during NREM and REM sleep.

In the first week of treatment, the highest pressure level (hCPAP) required did not differ between days, and the every day level of hCPAP also did not differ from oCPAP. However, the mean CPAP pressure level (mCPAP) required decreased significantly (P < 0.01) except 5 th and 7 th , and the percentage of sleep time spent in low level of CPAP pressure increased, and in high level of pressure decreased across time. Compare to the pressure at 7 th day of treatment, long term follow-up did not find a significant change of hCPAP and mCPAP at both 2 and 6 months. All patients had good compliance to CPAP treatment, with mean of 5.3 \u00b1 1.9 h/d and at least 6 \u00b1 0.8 d/week usage. No significant BMI change was noticed. Conclusion We found a decreased mean CPAP pressure level during short term treatment, which could be attributed to REM sleep rebound. As both short term and long term hCPAP required by patient did not change, there appears to be not necessary to do re-titration in most of the OSAHS patients using CPAP. Methods 31 OSAHS patients after UPPP surgery were recruited and studied more than 12 months after the procedure. Among them 24 patients were treated with classical UPPP (cUPPP), which removes all of uvula and part of soft palate. 7 had modified UPPP (mUPPP), keeping part of uvula. The control group was 31 age, BMI and AHI matched, newly diagnosed OSAHS patients without prior treatment. A manual titration of CPAP was performed during both NREM and REM sleep in all 62 patients. Patients were studied in the supine posture. When significant mouth air leakage occurred and/or titration worsened with an increase of CPAP pressure, the pressure level was considered as the highest CPAP (hCPAP) patient can tolerate in that sleep stage. The CPAP machine used for titration could produce a highest pressure of 20 cm H 2 O. Results 74% (23/31) of UPPP patients had less than 50% decrease in AHI, and 84% (26/31) of the 31 patients still had AHI >15 (range: 16-110) during postoperation PSG test, and most of needed therapy. All of the untreated OSAHS patients could tolerate 17-20 cm H 2 O of CPAP during sleep. None had severe mouth air leak before an optimal pressure reached. In contrast, four of the surgery group failed to respond to CPAP treatment during both NREM and REM sleep, and one more during REM sleep. All of the seven patients who had a mUPPP could tolerate CPAP. One of the three tested both before and after surgery failed to CPAP treatment after surgery during REM sleep. Conclusion In many patients, UPPP may compromise the ability to apply nasal CPAP as a subsequent therapy. Methods There were 89 patients with OSAS who were confirmed by full nocturnal polysomnography. Height, weight, body mass index (BMI), neck circumference (NC), neck length (NL) of patients were measured. These patients were divided into mild group [5 < apnea + hyponea index (AHI) < 20] and moderate-severe group (AHI > 20). Correlation analysis between the AHI and weight, BMI, NC, NL, NC/NL was performed. Thirty two non-apneic healthy volunteer served as controls (AHI < 5), student's t test was used to examine the differences in all variables between the apneic and non-apneic groups, and differences in variables between the mild and moderate-severe group.",

            "text": "Background Pulse Transit Time (PTT) had shown promise in the diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing as a measure of respiratory effort and arousal in adults and children. There is evidence in adults and children that PTT arousal is more sensitive than cortical arousal in measuring obstructive events. However the exact role of PTT arousal in the diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing in children is yet to be defined. Objective To explore the relationship between the autonomic arousal index as detected by PTT and cortical arousal index as detected by electroencephalograpy (EEG) with the respiratory events in children evaluated for obstructive sleep apnoea. Methods Tenty-two children aged between six and fourteen years old referred for further evaluations of possible obstructive sleep apnoea to the Sleep Unit at Princess Margaret Hospital between March to July 2004 were recruited. Standard overnight polysomnography was performed using Compumedic e-series and scored by standard criteria. PTT arousal was defined as reduction of more than 15 ms from baseline of greater than 5 seconds duration. Results Twenty-two patients consented for the study and fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Mean pulse transit time arousal index was significantly lower than the mean EEG arousal index. Most EEG arousals were not associated with PTT arousals. Similarly most PTT arousals occurred independently of EEG arousal. Respiratory events were more likely to result in EEG arousal than PTT arousal. Conclusion PTT arousal does not appear to be a more sensitive marker of arousal than EEG arousal. Furthermore PTT arousals do not relate to respiratory events. Further work is needed to determine the significant of PTT arousal in children. Background In 1993 Hoffstein and associates have reported the prediction formula for starting level of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). The ability to predict CPAP is likely to be of value in clinical sleep laboratory when allowing the optimal CPAP level to be achieved with only a few changes. However, the utility of the prediction formula has not been well assessed in Japanese patients with OSAS and some potential differences of the variability in predictive CPAP between Asian and Caucasian could be expected.",

Multiple linear regression analysis was used to further examine the determinants of predictive CPAP level, which was the dependent variable. In our patients group maximum r 2 methods revealed that the best threevariable subset was the one that included BMI, Time-S p O 2 < 90%, and ESS. This subset of variables resulted in r 2 = 0.42. Conclusion We conclude that the prediction formula which has been reported in Caucasian patients with OSAS may not fully explain the measured value of CPAP levels in our patients group. It may be caused by the potential differences between the two ethnic groups (Asian v.s. Caucasian patients with OSAS). Background Obesity, in particular abdominal obesity, is an established determinant of insulin resistance. There is growing evidence supporting a causal contribution of OSA on insulin resistance (1,2), independent of obesity. This prospective cohort study further investigated the relationship of abdominal fat, insulin resistance and sleep apnea. Methods Subjects were recruited from our sleep laboratory. Demographic and anthropometric data were collected. Overnight 16-channel polysomnography was performed.

Furthermore, most of these informations were from animal experiments. As there are species differences between animal and human, are the changes in human beings same as in animal? It is difficult to study the influence of the combination of isoniazid and rifampicin to the activity of Cytochrome P450 of human being, because of the reasons of medical ethics. Recent studies showed, human primary hepatocytes are the most similar system to liver in vivo in studying drug metabolism and hepatotoxicity. So we took the primary human hepatocytes as trial system to study the influence of isoniazid and rifampicin to the activities of CYP1A2 and 3A4, and the influence of these two drugs to the expression of mRNA of these two CYP450 isoenzymes. Objective To study the influence of either single or combinative using isoniazid and rifampicin to the activity of CYP1A2 and 3A4. (2) To observe the influence of either single or combinative using isoniazid and rifampicin to the expression of CYP1A2mRNA and 3A4mRNA, to explore the mechanism of influence of these two drugs to the activity of CYP1A2 and 3A4. Methods Part one: Hepatocytes were isolated from human liver, cultivated for 3 days. Then added isoniazid (25 mm; 50 mm), rifampicin (12.5 mmL; 25 mm), and both of them (for CYP1A2: rifampicin 12.5 mm & isoniazid 50 um, rifampicin 25 um & isoniazid 50 mm; for CYP3A4: rifampicin 12.5 mm & isoniazid 25 mm, rifampicin 25 um & isoniazid 25 um, rifampicin 25 um & isoniazid 50 mm), respectively. After cultured for 2 days added substrate (for CYP1A2: phenacetin; for CYP3A4: testosteone), 1 h later measured metabolite of them (for CYP1A2: acetaminophen; for CYP3A4: 6b-testosteone) with HPLC to assess the activity of CYP1A2 and 3A4. Part two: Hepatocytes were isolated from human liver, cultivated for 3 days. Then added isoniazid, rifampicin and both of them, respectively, at the concentration of which as those in Part one. With RT-PCR technique detected the expression of CYP1A2mRNA and 3A4mRNA, to explore the mechanism of these drug's influence to activities of CYP1A2 and 3A4. Results Part one: The activity of CYP1A2 in isoniazid groups with the concentration 25 mm and 50 mm was lower than that in control group (P < 0.01), but not less than 50% of that in control group. The activity of CYP1A2 in rifampicin group with the concentration 12.5 mm was higher than that in control group (P < 0.05), but was not 2 folds or more of that in control group. There was no statistical difference in activities between rifampicin with 25 mm and control groups (P > 0.05); The activity of CYP1A2 of combinative the groups with isoniazid and rifampicin was lower than that of the control group (P < 0.01), but was not less than 50% of that of control group. The activity of CYP3A4 in isoniazid groups with the concentration 25 mm and 50 mm was less than 50% of that in control group. The activity of CYP3A4 in rifampicin groups with the concentration of 12.5 mm and 25 mm was 13.18 and 9.59 times of that in control group, respectively. The activity of CYP3A4 in the combinative groups of isoniazid and rifampicin with 3 different concentration was 9.44, 6.19 and 5.48 times of that in the control group, respectively, but they were lower than those in rifampicin group with corresponding concentration (P < 0.05). Part two: Isoniazid with the concentration of 25 mm and 50 mm groups showed lower expression of CYP1A2mRNA than that of control group (P < 0.05), but there was no difference in expression of CYP1A2mRNA between isoniazid with the concentration of groups 25 mm and 50 mm (P > 0.05). There was also no difference in expression of CYP1A2 between rifampicin groups with the concentration 12.5 mm or 25 mm and control group. The expression of CYP1A2mRNA in the combinative groups of isoniazid and rifampicin with the concentration of R12.5 mm & I50 mm, R25 mm & I50 mm group was lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). There was no difference of the expression of CYP1A2mRNA between the combinative groups of isoniazid and rifampicin and single isoniazid groups with corresponding concentration (P < 0.05). The expression of CYP3A4mRNA in the isoniazid groups with the concentration of 25 mm and 50 mm that was lower than that in control group (P < 0.05). The expression of isoniazid with 50 mm group was lower than that in 25 mm group. The expression of CYP3A4mRNA in the rifampicin with the concentration of 12.5 mm and 25 mm group was higher than that in control group (P < 0.05). There was no difference of the expression level between rifampicin groups with 12.5 mm and 25 mm. The expression of CYP3A4mRNA in the three groups with different combinative concentration was higher than that in control groups (P < 0.01). But the expression in the combinative groups was lower than that in single rifampicin group with corresponding concentration (P < 0.05, P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). Conclusion (1) When isoniazid and rifampicin are used alone or combinatively in the range of maximum clinical blood concentration, they have not significant might inducting and inhibiting action to CYP1A2. (2) The combination of isoniazid and rifampicin cold induce the activity of CYP3A4, but the inducing level was lower than that induced by single rifampicin with the same concentration. (3) The drugs might influence the activity of CYP3A4 by the way of regulation the expression of CYP3A4mRNA.",

            "text": "Objective To investigate the protective effect of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) on mice infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis. Methods 96 female BALB/c mice were randomized into 4 groups, namely CpG ODN treatment (A group), control ODN treatment (B group), infectious control (C group) and healthy control (D group) (n = 24). A group and B group were treated once with CpG ODN or control ODN (30 mg/mouse) intraperitoneally 2 weeks before infection with mycobacterium tuberculosis. 1 \u00a5 10 6 bacili in a volume of 300 ml saline were injected into the tail vein of mice from A group, B group and C group. The 12 mice from each group were sacrificed at 3 weeks postinfection. The expression of Toll-like receptor 9mRNA and ctokines was detected by RT-PCR. The rest 12 mice from each group were monitored for 60 days to account the motality. Results CpG ODN could lengthen survival time of mice infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis, and decrease inflammation in lung tissue, and reduce mycobacterial outgrowth in lungs and spleens. The expression of TLR9mRNA in lungs and spleens of mice infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis was higher than that in healthy ones and CpG ODN didn't affect the expression of TLR9mRNA. Furthermore CpG ODN could increase the expression of IFN-g mRNA and IL-6 mRNA and depress the expression of IL-4 mRNA and IL-10 mRNA in lungs and spleens tissue. Conclusions CpG ODN could increase the immunity of mice infection with tuberculosis through up-regulate Th1 immunity and downregulate Th2 immunity. Backgroud Nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease may occur in patients with no underlying lung disease and no known immunodeficiency. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a potential role of natural-resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (NRAMP1) gene polymorphisms for human susceptibility to the nodular bronchiectatic form of nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease. Methods A case-control study was performed to compare the frequency of several polymorphisms in the NRAMP1 gene in 41 adult patients with nontuberculous mycobacterial disease (18 patients with M. avium complex infection and 23 patients with M. abscessus infection) and 53 healthy controls. Results Heterozygotes at INT4, D543N, and 3\u00a2UTR were observed at significant higher frequencies in patients with nontuberculous mycobacterial disease than in controls (P = 0.033, P = 0.014, and P = 0.002, respectively). The ORs were 2.61 (95% CI 1.07-6.37) for INT4 G/C, 4.31 (95% CI 1.26-14.78) for D543 G/A, and 7.15 (95% CI 2.12-24.18) for 3\u00a2UTR TGTG+/del. Subjects who were heterozygous for two NRAMP1 polymorphisms in INT4 and D543N were particularly overrepresented among those with nontuberculous mycobacterial disease, as compared with those with the most common NRAMP1 genotype (odds ratio 10.88, 95% CI 1.18-100.45, P = 0.035). There were no significant differences between the patients with M. avium complex infection and those with M. abscessus infection. Conclusion These findings suggest that the NRAMP1 genetic polymorphisms are associated with human susceptibility to nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease. Objective To investigate the in-vitro interferon-gamma (IFN-g) release assay based on different Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) antigens in the diagnosis of tuberculosis and of latent tubercular infections, and to compare it with the tuberculin skin test (TST). Methods All subjects were divided into three groups: group 1, patients with tuberculosis (n = 62); group 2, healthy (n = 27); group 3, patients with cancer (n = 29). The PBMC were cocultured for 5 days with different antigens: purified protein derivitives (PPD) of tuberculin, early secretary antigenic target 6 kDa protein (ESAT-6), 38 kDa antigen. The protein levels of IFN-g were detected by ELISA. Total RNA was extracted from the PBMC after 5 days culture. The expression of the IFN-g mRNA was detected by RT-PCR. Results For healthy control, the TST is positive related to the history of BCG vaccination and the contact degree with sputum-positive TB patients (P = 0.047, P = 0.041, respectively). But the ESAT-6 based IFN-g release assay is only significantly related to the contact degree with sputum-positive TB patients, and there is no significant positive relation with the history of BCG vaccination. The invitro IFN-g release level is highest in TB patients and is lowest in cancer patients. The sensitivity and the specificity of the IFN-g release assay based on 38 kDa are 64.9% and 89.3% for the diagnosis of tuberculosis. The expression of IFN-g mRNA was detected only in part of subjects using RT-PCR, and it did not correlated with the production of the IFN-g protein.",

Singapore has one of the fastest aging population in the region, and prevalence of diabetes is steadily rising. Aim To analyse the clinical profile and estimate the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis. Methods A prospective study was carried out on 58 adult patients, admitted to a general medical department with chronic cough, new pulmonary infiltrates and positive sputum smear for acid fast bacilli. There were 49 males and 9 females. 53% (31patients) had diabetes mellitus, the national prevalence is 4.7% among residents aged 18 years and above. 40% of Chinese and 60% of Malays and Indians suffered from diabetes. Among the 31 with diabetes, 61% were Malays, 29% Chinese and 10% Indians. One third of the patients were aged 60 years and above and 68% were diabetic, vs. a national prevalence of 20.7% in those aged 65 and above. Chest X-ray revealed, far advance disease in 48% of diabetics and 77% of non diabetics, and cavities were seen in 74% and 70% of diabetics and non diabetics, respectively. Conclusions The high prevalence of diabetes mellitus, especially among the elderly is a cause for grave concern. Public education and greater awareness among the health care providers is necessary, for early diagnosis and successful containment tuberculosis in Singapore.

Background The resurgence of tuberculosis, especially the development of multidrug resistant tuberculosis and dubious efficacy of BCG vaccine embarrassed the treatment and prevention-two keystones of tuberculosis control. The completion of whole genome of H37Rv is a rich mine. We can explore the resource by updated new technology to find better molecular targets for rapid diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis. Methods The newly developed molecular approach called in vivo induced antigen technology (IVIAT) has suggested to be very useful to identify microbial genes expressed specifically during human infections. M. tuberculosis would turn on the expressions of battery of genes that would be advantageous against human immune system. We use the IVIAT to screen the recombinant M. tuberculosis expression library constructed in pET30 vector. The tuberculosis patients sera as probe to screen the library. Results By using tuberculosis patients sera to screen M. tuberculosis expression library, we got several positive reaction clones. The sequence of these clones were determined and BLASTed for homologue. One positive clone dedicated to one ORF rv3878. The rv3878 appear to be interesting as the ORF is present in a 9.5 kb DNA fragment containing esat6 locus. This fragment denoted as RD1 region is present in M.tb complex but absent from M.bovis BCG and most environmental mycobacteria.

Anti-IL-15 inverted the effect of IL-15. The levels of IFN-g and TNF-a in type II pulmonary tuberculosis were lower than those in type III, but IL-4 and IL-10 were higher than those in type II. Conclusion IL-15 could enhance Th1 cytokine (IFN-g) and proin flammation (TNF-a), and inhibite IL-4 and IL-10, IL-15 could regulate the balance of Th1 and Th2 cytokines. IL-15 could be an important cytokine for tuberculosis immunetherapy. Background Rapid detection of resistant to rifampin is important, the conventional method of determining susceptibility to antituberculosis drugs by plating on solid medium requires a long time. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the significance of quantitative analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis mRNA in the test of susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains to rifampin. Methods The susceptibility to rifampin of 53 clinical isolated strains were test by the percentage of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 85B mRNA copies before and after the use of rifampin, and 1% and 10% were used as the standards for drug resistance, which was compared with absolute concentration method.

IL-7 could be useful for the treatment tuberculosis. Objectives A genetic tendency to Pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) is referred to as inherited thrombophilia and it is undoubtedly a polygenic abnormality. The basis of our understanding of the thrombophilic state is that it arises from an imbalance between the procoagulant, anticoagulant and fibrinolytic components of the coagulation system, resulting in an increased tendency to thrombosis. In this casecontrol study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of the fibrinolytic parthway related gene polymophisms such as the insertion deletion polymorphsim of human tissue type plasminogen activator (TPA) gene, dimorphism in the plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) promoter 4G/5G polymorphsims in Chinese Han population and investigate whether they are associated with PTE. Methods The subjects consisted of 101 patients with PTE and 101 age and sexmatched healthy controls from the same geographic area. All patients were diagnosed by high probability of lung ventilation/perfusion scan and/or multi-slice CT pulmonary angiography as well as medical history and clinical manifestations. Genome DNA was extracted from whole blood using KI-phenol-chloroform. (1) Standard PCR were used to determine the prevalence of the insertion deletion polymorphsim of human TPA gene.",

Results TPA gene: Frequencies of allele I and D in the controls were 0.515 and 0.485 respectively, the distribution of genotypes met the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. No significant differences were found in the frequencies of genotype II, ID and DD between patients and controls., nor in allele I and D. The incidences of DD genotype of TPA genes were slightly higher in cases than in controls. Background The pathogenic mycobacteria cause the deaths of millions of people every year. One of the reasons these pathogens are so successful is that they are able to invade and replicate within host macrophages, so study the difference in gene expression between the tuberculous granulation tissue and normal tissue nearby the lesions is important for selecting the candidate of TB bio-therapy. Methods We made cDNA microarray in which 626 immunogenesis genes were involved. The tuberculous lesions were in 11 osteoarticular tuberculosis, Paired mRNAs from normal osteoarticular tissue specimens from the same cases were labeled with different fluorochromes during cDNA probe synthesis in a reversetranscription reaction. The signal intensity of each spot was measured by laser scanner and gene expression was quantified as the tubercle-to-normal fluorescence ratio (T : N ratio). The gene was overexpressed when the T : N ratio was greater than 2.0 and underexpressed when the ratio was less than 0.5. Results Among 626 immunogenesis associated genes there were 66 genes difference significant, of which 52 expressed higher and 14 lower in tuberculous granulation tissue than that of the controls. Conclusion The numerous alterations of gene expression were present in tuberculous lesions of osterarticular tuberculosis specimens. These results increase the understanding of the mechanisms used by pathogenic mycobacteria to cause disease, the host response to these organisms and provide new insights for antimycobacterial intervention strategies. Poland's syndrome (PS) is a non-genetic congenital abnormality characterized by various degrees of unilateral anterior chest wall hypoplasia and a variety of associated anomalies. PS occurs in 1 : 30,000 live births. We observed 27 patients, 20 of whom we operated upon. The severity of cardio-respiratory impairment correlates with the severity of the syndrome. Reduction of thoracic volume due to depression deformity is observed in up to 25% of PS patients. Paradoxical chest wall movements are possible, especially during stress or pulmonary infection with a reduction of vital capacity to half, particularly in patients with rib defects, which occur in 20% of PS patients. Lung herniation occurs in 8% of PS cases. Radiography confirms unilateral hyperlucent lung and shift of the heart towards the unaffected side. Isolated dextrocardia is observed in 6%, and always in patients with left-sided PS. Bullous pulmonary disease and spontaneous pneumothorax were also described. Extreme forms of PS may be associated with diaphragmatic hernia. Surgical correction is usually carried out in children in two stages, and in adults in one stage. During surgery, unilateral ventilation of the opposite lung is recommended, as well as epidural anesthesia, which should be continued postoperatively. The rib defect and lung herniation are corrected by bony allo-or autografts or split rib grafts taken from the unaffected side. It may also be repaired with a prosthetic mesh patch sutured to the aplastic rib stumps in combination with the latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap. In female adult patients, prosthetic breast implantation is advisable. Background To identify the causes and clinical characteristics, and efficacy of various diagnostic approaches, we studied prospectively of the pediatric patients with chronic recurrent chest pain. Methods Prospective study of 122 patients with chronic recurrent chest pain from June 1998 to June 2003 were performed. Male and female ratio was 81 : 41, age 9.3 \u00b1 3.1 year. A single chart including pain description (histoy) and pain questionaire, associated sympoms was used for systematic history taking. The patients were devided in two groups, Group A, before June 2001 (n = 70), Group B, after June 2001 (n = 52). Chest X-ray and ECG were checked in all patients. But, allergy test and echocardiography, 24 hour ECG monitoring, exercise test, pulmonary function test, gastrointestinal fiberendoscopy were performed selectively. Results Idiopathic origin was most common (32%). The remaining causes were psychogenic (23%) and exercise-induced asthma (20.5%), hyperventilation syndrome (9.1%), tachyarrhythmia (4.9%), cardiac (4.1%), pulmonary (3.3%), reflux esophagitis (2.5%) in order. The positive rate of allergy test (24%) was higher than that of cardiac examinations (11-20%). Exercise-induced asthma was more common than psychogenic causes after June, 2001. Various abdominal symptoms were accompanied in idiopathic and psychogenic chest pain, hyperventilation syndrome. Headache was more commonly found in psychogenic pain, but chest tightness and dyspnea were common in hyperventilation syndrome. About half of exercise-induced asthma had symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Conclusion In majority (72%) of exercise-induced asthma, the chest pain was induced or aggravated by exercise, and relieved by rest. Causative antigens were detected in 69.2% among group B patients with exerciseinduced asthma. Exercise-induced chest pain might be a first manifestation in allergy patients. So, we recommand allergy test for patients with recurrent chest pain that was inducing or aggravating by exercise. Hence, cardiac examinations such as echocardiography or 24 hour ECG monitoring could performed selectively case by case. Etiology of Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is largely unknown and may be heterogeneous, because there are several ethnic differences in clinical characteristics of CTEPH. Female predominance and a higher ratio of chronic to acute pulmonary thromboembolism have been reported in Japanese as compared to the USA. Because such ethnic differences may be controlled by genetic factors, we investigated HLA polymorphisms in Japanese patients with CTEPH. HLA typing by serological and/or DNA typing methods was performed (for HLA-A, B, DPB1, DRB1) in 80 patients and 678 controls, and the association of clinical characteristics with HLA alleles was studied. The frequencies of HLA-B*5201 (40% vs. 24%, odds ratio = 2.14, Pc = 0.037) and DPB1*0202 (19% vs. 6%, odds ratio = 3.41, Pc = 0.0014) were significantly higher in the patients. HLA-B*5201 positive patients showed significant female predominance. Total pulmonary vascular resistance and mixed venous oxygen tension were better in the HLA-B*5201 positives. In contrast, cardiac index and gas exchange parameters were worse in the HLA-DPB1*0202 positives. In the patients carrying HLA-B*5201 and/or -DPB1*0202, the frequency of deep vein thrombosis was significantly lower than the other patients. These observations suggested that both the susceptibility and clinical characteristics of CTEPH were controlled in part by the HLA-B and -DPB1 loci. Background Studying the incidence of cause of lung mass and differential diagnosis in adult cases was made, and value is finely known and exposed to all, but unfortunately such studies has not yet made on children especially in Iran. Materials and Method Studying a six years survey (1376-1382) on operated cases files in Dr. Sheikh Hospital, 37 cases under went surgery for lung mass. Results We found that hydatid cyst were 19 cases (51%); local empyema 6 cases (16%); lung abscess 4 cases (11%); congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) 4 cases (11%); Pleuropulmonary blastoma 2 cases (5%); pulmonary sequestration 1 case (3%) and askin tumor 1 case (3%).

Lung function, including bronchodilator response was successfully measured by spirometry (Sensormedics Vmax29) in 110 children and by forced oscillation (2-48 Hz Chess Medical i2M) in 143. As the validity of FEV 1 has been questioned in this age group, we also investigated the use of FEV 0.5 as an outcome variable. While lung function tended to be lower in the asthmatic children, this only reached statistical significance for pre-bronchodilator FEV 0.5 /FVC (70% v 75%, P < 0.05). Asthmatics had great increases in lung function with bronchodilator (FEV 0.5 : 10.0% v 4.6%, FEV 0.5 /FVC: 6.2% v 2.8%, respiratory reactance at 6 Hz: 36.2% v 18.7%) than non-asthmatics.

Males accounted for 47% of cases and females 53%. The majority of diagnosed cases (74%) were from medical and 26% from surgical services. Immobilization was the most commonly identified predisposing factor in 46% cases, followed by malignancy in 20%, postoperative status in 20% and 12% with hypercoagulability (previous venous thromboembolism, anticardiolipin antibody syndrome and oral contraceptive use). Only 40% of patients were on any form of prophylaxis; the most commonly used method was subcutaneous heparin (58%) with compression stockings and low molecular weight heparin in 21% each. The d-Dimer test and venous doppler scan were positive in 56% and 60% of patients respectively. Spiral CT was diagnostic in 82% cases. Prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism is significantly underutilized at our hospital. Spiral CT was confirmed as the best diagnostic modality. Serum D-dimer assay has emerged as a very popular test for screening patients with acute venous thromboembolism. Most studies quote a sensitivity upto 90%. The objective of our study was to evaluate the clinical utility of D-dimer assay in our local setting. We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients diagnosed with acute venous thromboembolism (deep venous thrombosis and or pulmonary thromboembolism) for the period 2000 to 2004. The diagnosis was confirmed by Spiral CT scan, venous Doppler, Perfusion scan or Pulmonary angiogram. All patients' who also had a D-dimer assay were included in the study. In our hospital, D-dimers are detected using a 'D-dimer Plus' kit. This relies on a latex turbidimetric measurement of the concentration of D-dimer in venous blood. The manufacturer claims a correlation coefficient of 0.99 with a y-intercept of -109 and a slope of 1.21 when compared to commercially available assays. One hundred and fifty nine patients were diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis and or pulmonary embolism during the study period. D-dimer measurements were done in 114 (72%) patients. Seventy-two patients had a positive result whilst forty-two were negative. The calculated Sensitivity of the test comes to 63%.

To investigate the events contributing to inflammatory cell recruitment in the bronchial mucosa we exposed 10 healthy nonsmoking volunteers to 400 ppb ozone or filtered air for 2 h at rest on two separate occasions. Bronchial biopsies were performed 6 h after ozone/filtered air exposure. The biopsies were embedded in glycol mathacrylate and immunostained for inflammatory cells, including neutrophils, mast cells, total T-cells (CD3), T-cell subsets CD8 and CD4, macrophages, eosinophils adhesion molecules (P-selectin, E-selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1) cytokines (TNF-a, IL-1b, GM-CSF, IL-6), chemokines (IL-8 and RANTES), and nuclear factor NF-kB. No significant changes were seen in the number of T-cells and T-cell subsets, macrophages, eosinophils or percentages of vessels expressing P-selectin, VCAM-1, GM-CSF, IL-6 and RANTES in the biopsies. The number of neutrophils and mast cells in the submucosa was significantly higher after ozone exposure (P = 0.009 and P = 0.005 respectively).

Background Though CPAP can improve anoxemia has been approved, Results of the cardiovascular effects of CPAP in ACPE have been controversial, with increased, decreased, or unchanged cardiac output (CO) when CPAP applied. Methods ACPE happened when healthy dogs elevated blood volume significantly. Cardiac output (CO), heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP), central venous pressure (CVP) and intrathoracic pressure (Pt) were measured and recorded before model making and at spontaneous breath, 5 cmH 2 O, 10 cmH 2 O, 15 cmH 2 O CPAP successively in ACPE dogs. Results ACPE occurrence induced significant reduction of CO, BP (P < 0.05) and significant elevation of PAP, PAWP, HR, and Pt (from -(4.90 \u00b1 0.09) to -(10.90 \u00b1 0.75) cmH 2 O (P < 0.05)). PaO 2 decreased (P < 0.05). CPAP at 5 cmH 2 O induced a proper increase in CO and pt (P < 0.05), a slightly drop in PAP, PAWP and HR (P < 0.05). Anoxemia was corrected. CPAP at 10 cmH 2 O decreased CO (P < 0.05), elevated PAP and PAWP (P < 0.05) and Pt (P < 0.01). HR and BP remain.

Background Single lung transplantation (SLT) and bilateral lung transplantation (BLT) are routinely performed in patients with COPD and primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) and secondary pulmonary hypertension (SPH) in western country. But in most Asian country it is far from routine work. Especially for late COPD, we usually treat the late COPD by both lung volume reduction (LVRD) and single lung transplantation. We have more 120 cases LVRD and 4 cases SLT experiences. We reviewed our 4 cases experience with lung transplants for COPD and SPH to determine if any advantage exists with SLT. Methods For 3 COPD cases, ones Fev1 was 23%, the others were respiratory failure, could not accepted the lung function test; the SPH fev1 was 30%, but O2 was less 9 kPa. Two cases HLA and height were match, gene match point were over 6 and the other were unmatch. The 2 COPD and one SPH cases accepted Right SLT, 1 COPD case accepted left SLT. A small muscle spare lateral thoracotomy incision is made for SLT. With ventilation to the contralateral lung, the standard pneumonectomy is being perfomed. During the implantation bronchial anastomosis is performed as the first one. Pulmonary artery anastomosis was followed. The procedure continues with anastomosis of pulmonary veins. De-airing of venous system follows. Venous system was tighten by pulling the ends of the above mentioned venous suture, which was still not tied. Microorganisms from the bronchial secretion of the donor and the recipient are being examined routinely. Immunosuppressive therapy was introduced immediately after transplantation. FK 506 was administered in dose 0.2 mg/kg/day by oral. Later the dose was adopted according to the blood level about 15-20 ng/ml at first week, 10-15 ng/ml at second week and 10-12 ng/ml at following week. MMF was given 0.5 mg B.i.d orally if white cell was over 6000. Single intravenous dose of Methylprednisolone was applied (500.1000 mg/ according to the patients weight) just before reperfusion. Further dosage was within 1 mg/kg/day postoperatively. The immunosuppressivum were Anti-thymocite globulin (ATG) and anti-T-cell-body. Its dosage was variable. It was applied as an induction therapy only during the early post-transplant period. 50 mg daily dosage ATG was given continuously 7 days. The two cases who HLA are match have not given steroid after SLT 6 months. Now usually they just take once FK 506, MMF one day and are checked their FK 506 blood level and follow up their life situation in out patient department every 3 month after SLT. Results All cases have been alive after SLT. The average hospitalization day after operation were 28 days, and the blood lost average each case was 1500 ml. In one case acute rejection was occurred in 5 th day, and the other was occurred in 11 th month, both of them were healed by induce and steroid treatment. The longest case is being 20 month. The first 2 cases who had SLT in 2003, they have being work their former jobs after they accepted SPT 4 months. The average fees were nearly 50000 USD. The other two cases were too early to work. The FEV1 each was 47%, 45% in one year. The 6 minute-walk distance each is 650 m, 450 m, and 420 m at the 40th days after SLT. Conclusion We believe that SLT is the last and effective procedure of choice for COPD. It can improve the Patients pulmonary function indeed and make them enjoy their life as well as working ability as before again. Objective Ozone is a broad-spectrum germicide.

Background Sepsis remains a major cause of morbidity and morality in hospitalized patients.The primary cause of sepsis result from activation of host effector cells, by endotoxin, the lipopolysacchride (LPS) associated with cell membranes of Gram-negative bacteria. Whereas the acute-phase rise lipopolysacchride-binding protein (LBP) initate and amplify the process. Nowadays more and more studies show that blockade the initial process can prevent the development of sepsis. Methods Select peptide which block LBP inflammatory function site by phage display, then examined the effects of the peptide on the binding of FITC-LPS to Phorbolmyristate-acetate (PMA) differentiated U937 (human macrophage-like cell line) by flow cytometer, the mRNA expression and protein production of TLR4 and CD14 by RT-PCR and Western blot, the NFk B DNA-binding activity by EMSA, the TNF a (tumor necrosis factor alpha) production by ELISA.",

Methods Rat diaphragm muscle strips were dissected and mounted in tissue baths under hypoxic (PO 2~ 6.5 kPa) or hyperoxic (PO 2~ 88 kPa) conditions (60 cin). Force frequency relationship was determined. Subsequently, muscle nitrotyrosine formation was assessed as a measure of ONOO formation. In addition, the effects of fatiguing isotonic contractions were determined on nitrotyrosine formation under hypoxic and hyperoxic conditions (60 min). Results Hypoxia depressed force frequency relationship (P < 0.001 vs. hyperoxia). Nitrotyrosine optical density of protein bands already present under hyperoxic conditions was significantly enhanced by hypoxia. Also, additional protein bands were detected during hypoxia at 295 and 243 kDa. Fatigue endurance was reduced under hypoxic conditions (P < 0.05 vs. hyperoxia). Fatiguing contractions increased nitrotyrosine formation under hyperoxic conditions (P < 0.05 vs. rest), but not under hypoxic conditions (P > 0.05 vs. rest).",

The pathogenesis of PAP is unclear. To investigate the expression of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), GM-CSF/IL-3/IL-5 receptor common beta chain (bc receptor), surfactant protein (SP)-A and SP-D in adult patients with idiopathic PAP, so as to demonstrate the possible association of the GM-CSF, bc receptor, SP-A and SP-D with human PAP. Methods The exprssion of GM-CSF, GM-CSF bc receptor, SP-A and SP-D on the alveolar macrophages and alveolar type II epithelial cells were detected by Immunohistochemical staining. Results The age was 51.83 \u00b1 9.52 years old in adult patients with idiopathic PAP (6 cases, males 4, females 2) and 48.75 \u00b1 12.59 years old in normal adult individuals (6 cases, males 4, females 2). There was no difference in the expression of GM-CSF and SP-D on alveolar macrophages between adult patients with idiopathic PAP and normal adult individuals. The expression of GM-CSF and SP-D on alveolar macrophages in adult patients with idiopathic PAP was less than that in normal adult individuals. There was no expression of GM-CSF and bc receptor on alveolar type II epithelial cells in adult patients with idiopathic PAP and normal adult individuals. There was no difference in the expression of SP-A and SP-D on alveolar type II epithelial cells between adult patients with idiopathic PAP and normal adult individuals. Conclusion The decresed expression of GM-CSF bc receptor on alveolar macrophages in the adult patients with idiopathic PAP is one of possible pathogenesis of idiopathic adult PAP.

TGF-b 1 genotype and allele frequencies were not significantly different for patients with lung cancer (n = 102) and controls (nonsmokers, n = 140 or smokers, n = 116). The odds ratio of the TGF-b 1 C allele at nucleotide position 869 was 0.51 (95% confidence interval 0.25 to 1.06; P = 0.0827) for patients and nonsmoking controls and 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.23 to 1.03; P = 0.0702) for patients and smoking controls in a dominant model (TC + CC versus TT), close to reach significant level. The patients group showed significant higher plasma TGF-b 1 levels across different genotypes (1852 \u00b1 123 pg/ml vs. 3422 \u00b1 158 pg/ml for nonsmoking controls and patients respectively).

CPT-11 is converted into its active metabolite, 7-ethyl-10hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38), by carboxylesterase found in the plasma, the intestinal mucosa and the liver. SN-38 is further metabolized by UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) to its inactive form, SN-38 glucuronide (SN-38-Glu), and subsequently secreted into the intestine via bile. Recently the number of patients with renal dysfunction is increasing. The medication method of CPT-11 in patients with renal dysfunction is not established. We examined pharmacokinetics of CPT-11 in patients with thoracic malignant tumor and renal dysfunction. Method Plasma samples were collected at 1, 2, 4, 12 and 24 hours after the infusion of CPT-11 (40 mg/m 2 ) in 2 patients. Result The maximum concentration (Cmax) of CPT-11 and SN38 in plasma was reached between 0 and 2 hours from the onset of infusion. Cmax of SN38G in plasma was reached between 4 and 12 hours from the onset of infusion. Pharmacokinetic profiles of CPT-11, SN38 and SN38G in plasma at a dose of 40 mg/m 2 in patients with renal dysfunction were approximately equivalent to those at a dose of 50 mg/m 2 in patients with normal renal function. Third or fourth Grade toxicity were not seen. Conclusion 40 mg/m 2 drip infusion of CPT-11 for patients with thoracic malignant tumor and renal dysfunction is feasible.",

Current diagnostic criteria of positive mediastinal lymph node metastasis in CT images is defined as the lymph node over 1 cm in diameter. After the introduction of FDG-PET in our institute, some lymph nodes with diameters under 1 cm appeared with increased amount of standardized unit volume (SUV) in pet images. We retrospectively examined the size of mediastinal lymph nodes in CT images among patients with positive level of FDG-PET, and analyzed the sensitivity of FDG-PET. Study population and results Fifteen patients had increased level of SUV in mediastinal region among 78 cases of NSCLC examined by FDG-PET (Oct, 2003 to May, 2004). Seven (47%) of these appeared as negative metastasis in CT images (lymph node size under 1 cm in diameter). Conclusions FDG-PET could be useful in finding small metastasis of mediastinal lymph nodes. The obvious discrepancy in the positivity of FDG-PET and lymph node size in CT images poses the need for investigation on the criteria of the mediastinal lymph node metastasis.",

Methods Sleep apnea was assessed by polysomnography, pulmonary function was assessed by spirometry. Results Forced vital capacity (FVC), maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV) in patients with OSAS were significantly lower than those in control subjects (P < 0.01), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), maximal midexpiratory flow curve (MMEF), FVC, and MVV in patients with overlap syndrome were significantly lower than those in patients with OSAS and in control subjects (P < 0.01). Oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) were decreased in patients with OSAS and with overlap syndrome during sleep. Analysis showed that the FVC, MVV, functional residual capacity (FRC) were inversely correlated with AHI, but positively correlated with SaO 2 nadir in patients with OSAS; in other hand, FEV1, FVC, MVV, MMEF were inversely correlated with AHI, but positively correlated with SaO 2 nadir in patients with overlap. Conclusions Sleep apnea and hypoxemia at night are correlate with decrease of lung volume in patients with OSAS, and severity degree of sleep apnea and oxygen desaturation are correlate with pulmonary function abnormalities and airway obstruction in patients with OSAS coexisting COPD. Decrease of lung volume and increase of airway resistance could aggravate to the severity of sleep-induced respiratory abnormality and hypoxemia at night in patients with overlap syndrome.",

The Results 55 men, aged 21-65, BMI 27.2+/-4.6, AHI 30.1+/-5.2 were recruited. There were significant linear relationships of insulin resistance with AHI, arousal index, O 2 sat < 90%, urinary norepinephrine, waist circumference, BMI, body fat, HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride (P < 0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that AHI (P < 0.001) and abdominal fat (P < 0.001)/waist circumference (P < 0.005)/BMI (P < 0.001) were independent predictors of insulin resistance. Conclusion Sleep disordered breathing reflected by AHI was a determinant of insulin resistance, independent of obesity reflected by detailed quantification of body fat.

The MTB-macrophage interaction system also represents an ideal paradigm for unraveling microbiological and host cell biological mechanisms. Methods Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) was employed to compare the global protein patterns between human macrophage cell line U937 infected and that uninfected with Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MTB) Isoniazid (INH) resistant strains, and 32 protein spots were found to express differentially. Five protein spots which remarkably increased in U937 infected with MTB INH-resistant strains were measured by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The data obtained from peptide mass fingerprinting were used in protein database search. Results Five protein spots in gel were identified as HSP105 b , inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1, Phosphoglycerate mutase 1, cathepsin B, desmocollin 3. Conclusion These data provide insight into the changed global protein patterns of the U937 while in stasis shortly after infection and may prove useful for further study in the interaction between MTB INH-resistant strains and host.

The aim of this study was to evaluate differences in clinical characteristics and outcome among culture positive and culture negative miliary TB patients from Pakistan, a high TB burden country. Methods All adult patients with miliary TB, admitted between 1994 and 2001, were identified using a computerized database. These patients were divided into culture positive and culture negative groups and their clinical characteristics, lab investigations and outcome were recorded and compared. SPSS version 10 was used for statistical analysis. Results Of 110 patients diagnosed with miliary TB, 32 (30%) patients were culture positive. The most frequent sources of positive cultures were sputum (37%), cerebrospinal fluid (18%) and lymph nodes (12%). Half of the patients in both groups were between 30 and 60 years of age. There was female predominance (60%) in culture negative patients. Smoking was more common among culture positive patients (P = 0.02). Majority of clinical features, comorbidities and lab investigations were similar in both groups except the culture positive miliary TB patients were more anorexic (P = 0.013) and breathless (P = 0.05) at presentation and their chest radiographs showed more fibrosis (P = 0.009). There was no significant difference in complications (P = 0.50), and mortality (P = 0.38) in both groups. Conclusion There was no significant difference in clinical characteristics, comorbidities, lab investigations and outcome between culture positive and culture negative miliary TB patients. High clinical suspicion and early treatment is therefore recommended in high prevalent countries.COMPARISON OF LIQUID AND SOLID MEDIUMRESULTS AFTER STARTING THE INITIAL TREATMENT FOR TUBERCULOSIS MASAYUKI NAKAYAMA, TAKEFUMI SAITO, YOSHIKO KANEKO, TAKIO TAKAKU, KOZO MORIMOTO, TAKAHIDE KODAMA, KOICHI WATANABE,KENJI HAYASHIHARA National Hospital Organization Ibarakihigashi National Hospital, Japan",

Pyocyanin, a blue phenazine pigment produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, has been shown to synergise with IL-1 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in triggering IL-8 release. Mechanisms regulating the synergising effects are minimally understood. We hypothesized that the potentiation of IL-8 release in airway epithelial cells would result from activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and subsequent activation of the specific mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, so we investigated signal transduction pathways in human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B). IL-1b and phorbol 12,13dibutyrate (PDBu) induced the release of IL-8 in BEAS-2B. Pyocyanin alone caused no release of IL-8 but potentiated IL-1b-and PDBu-mediated IL-8 release. The stimulation of IL-8 in the presence of pyocyanin plus PDBu or IL-1b required activation of PKC [inhibition by Go 6976 (an selective inhibitor of classic PKC isoforms)]. Go 6976 (100 mM) inhibited PDBu-stimulated IL-8 release in the presence of pyocyanin profoundly (1.35 \u00b1 0.32% maximal response; n = 3; P < 0.001). U0126 (a potent and specific inhibitor of MEK-1/MEK-2), and SB203580 (a selective inhibitor of p38 MAPK) showed profound inhibition on IL-1b-and PDBu-mediated IL-8 release in the presence of pyocyanin but SP600125 (a novel selective JNK inhibitor; 10 mM) failed to inhibit PDBu-mediated IL-8 release in the presence of pyocyanin. The data demonstrate regulation of IL-8 release by PKC pathways converging on the specific MAPK pathways in the local airway responses. (Supported by Hong Kong RGC CERG award 2003-2004.)",

Mycobacteria vaccae vaccine (M. vaccae) is a potent stimulant of Th1-type response, which can down-regulate Th2-driven allergic process. Methods 30 guinea pigs were divided into NS, Asthma and M.vaccae groups at random. A guinea pig model of asthma was formed with ovalbumin. Every guinea pig of M. vaccae group was injected intramuscularly with 22.5 mg M. vaccae 10 Results After ovalbumin challenge, guinea pigs of Asthma group had typical asthma-like symptoms, whereas those of M. vaccae group lightly increased their respiratory frequency. Guinea pigs of M. vaccae group had lower level of total IgE, ovalbumin-specfic IgE and ECP in serum, fewer inflammation cells in BALF, slighter asthmatic inflammation response in lung tissue, less mRNA expression of IL-4 and IL-5 but more mRNA expression of IFN-g in lung tissue than those of asthma group, and the differences between two groups in all parameters as above were statistically significant. Conclusions Our results showed M. vaccae could prevent the development of asthmatic guinea pig because it could modulate Th1/Th2 immune response in lung tissue and decrease the level of total IgE, ovalbumin-specfic IgE and ECP in serum of asthmatic guinea pigs.",

Spirometry was performed in the sit position, diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (D L CO) was measured by single-breath method. The determinations of Dm and Vc were done by the method of Roughton. Thirty-six health subjects were selected as control group.Result Subgroup A has normal D L CO and Vc compared with the control group, but the value of Dm was significantly lower than that of the control group. In subgroup B and C, all the values of D L CO, Dm and Vc were significantly lower than those of the control group. Conclusion The measurements of Dm and Vc are sensitive tests to find the impaired of lung diffusion capacity in patients with COPD, espesialy in early stage COPD.EFFECTS OF LONG-TERM OXYGEN THERAPY ON SURVIVAL AND EVALUATION OF SURVIVAL PREDICTORS FOR PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASEBackground Data on survival of COPD patients in Asia Pacific Region is scarce. The current study is a retrospective cohort survival analysis of patients suffering from COPD requiring Long Term Oxygen Therapy (LTOT) admitted and/or followed up in Respiratory Medical Department, Kowloon Hospital from 1993 to 1999. Methods Case notes of COPD patients put on LTOT between 1993 & 1999 were reviewed. Kaplan-Meier for survival analysis and Cox-regression for survival predictors analysis were performed. The survival status of these patients was confirmed through review of Clinical Management System of the Hospital Authority and the Death Registry of Hong Kong. Results 455 COPD patients put on LTOT from 1993 to 1999 were identified from a database system of Occupational Therapy Department of Kowloon Hospital. 225 patients were excluded for reasons of co-existing lung diseases or other comorbidies that affect survival, short duration of LTOT and non-fulfillment of LTOT prescription criteria. The remaining 230 patients were analysed for survival versus time. The mean age of the cohort is 70 \u00b1 8.4. Their mean % of predicted FEV 1 was 27 \u00b1 10. A total of 139 subjects were identified dead on the censored date on 31 December 2001. The median survival time for our COPD patients on LTOT was 41 months. The survival rates were 88% at the 1 st year, 68% at the 2 nd year, 56% for the 3 rd year, 41% for the 4 th year and 29% for the 5 th year. Gender, age and ADL independence level had significant impact in survival based on Kaplan-Meier analysis: female patients had longer survival than male patients, patients aged <70 and those with higher ADL independence level had better survival. Multivariate analysis with Cox regression revealed that age, gender and ADL independence level were the only survival predictors after adjusting for other potential variables including FEV 1 , % predicted FEV 1 , FVC, FEV 1 /FVC, PaO 2 , PaCO 2 , smoking pack year and prescribed oxygen flow rate. Younger female patients with higher degree of independence in ADL had longer survival. The beneficial effect of LTOT in reducing hospital admissions and length of stay was not demonstrated in the present study.Conclusions Our study provides valuable information on the survival of hypoxaemic COPD patients put on LTOT in Hong Kong. Besides young age and female sex, a higher degree of independence in daily living is associated with a longer survival. Further multi-centered study is recommended to confirm the findings. (Supported by the Hong Kong Lung Foundation Research Fund)Background Simple global assessments of health status can be useful in determining clinical meaningfulness of associated measures(1). The SGRQ is commonly used to measure health status in COPD, including the evaluation of pharmacotherapy. An improvement of approximately 4 units in SGRQ scores has been regarded as having clinical relevance. Such associations in the Japanese population have not been assessed to the same extent as in other populations. Spirometry was measured prior to and one hour after administration of study drugs. The value prior to therapy is termed the trough FEV 1 .Results SGRQ mean scores improved as PGI and PGE improved. The magnitude of change in SGRQ total and impact scores were approximately 4 units with end of study assessment of 'improvement' by both the patients and physicians. There was little deterioration in these patients.The mean trough FEV 1 at end of study associated with a physician rating of 'Improvement' was 93 \u00b1 161 ml while the value associated with patient perception was 50 \u00b1 167. The mean FVC values associated with physician and patient improvements were 224 \u00b1 496 and 98 \u00b1 481 respectively.",

Recent data have suggested an important role of antioxidants and reactive oxygen species in lung carcinogenesis. However, the exact antioxidant profiles in subjects with NSCLC are lacking. We have conducted a study of the systemic antioxidant activities in red blood cell lysate from subjects with NSCLC and healthy control subjects. Method Antioxidants (catalase, superoxide dismutase [SOD], and glutathione peroxidase [GPx]) were measured using chemical kinetic reactions under spectrophotometry as previously described.1 Results There were 189 cases of mostly advanced stage IIIB or IV NSCLC (67% males, 57.0 \u00b1 11.7 years, 56% ever-smoked, 56% adenocarcinoma) and 202 healthy controls (59% males, 49.5 \u00b1 15.6 years, 39% ever-smoked) being studied. In subjects with lung cancer, there were higher catalase activity (32.6 \u00b1 4.3 vs 23.5 \u00b1 0.9 mU/g haemoglobin (Hb), P = 0.03), lower SOD activity (26.4 \u00b1 2.4 vs 55 \u00b1 2.5 U/gHb, P < 0.001), and higher GPx activity (227.3 \u00b1 12.4 vs 50.8 \u00b1 1.1 mU/gHb, P < 0.001) compared with controls. The antioxidant activities in lung cancer subjects were not associated with age, gender, smoking status, or tumour cell types. However, more advanced disease (stage IV compared to IIIB) was associated with lower SOD activity (21.8 \u00b1 2.5 vs 37.0 \u00b1 5.7 U/gHb respectively, P = 0.03). Using multivariate analysis, the presence of lung cancer independently predicts catalase, SOD, and GPx activities.ConclusionNSCLC in Chinese is associated with alterations in systemic antioxidant activities, which may play an important role in carcinogenesis.

Methods We had forty-seven cases of EBTB with marked tracheobronchial stenosis and/or tracheomalacia. Based on the experience of traditional surgical treatment for EBTB, We discussed the indications of endobronchial stent implantation in the treatment of EBTB. In accordance with different location, range and property of lesion, 22 domestic made Ni-Ti memory alloy stents and 25 Ultraflex stents were implanted respectively under general or local anesthetic. At the time of stenting and 1 week, 4-6 months after stenting, the lumen of stenosis segment, dyspnea index and pulmonary function were measured to evaluate the improvement of ventilation function. cases), but the restenosis rate is lower in tracheobronchial malacia and cicatricial constriction type (less than than 10%).

Between 2002 and 2004, we evaluated 21 patients of lung cancer with PET before surgery. All of the patients subsequently received surgical resection with mediastinal lymph node dissection for lung cancer. The predictive value of PET was analyzed by comparison with the pathological results of the surgical specimen. There were 11 males and 10 females in this study. Twelve patients presented with suspected spots in the mediastinum or pulmonary hilum in addition to the lesions of the main tumor in PET, whereas only 4 of whom proved to have intrathoracic nodal metastasis pathologically.

            "text": "Conclusion The newly established multi-drug resistant large cell lung cancer cell line (H460/cDDP) appears to be a typical multi-drug resistant phenotype. p53 mutation induced by cisplatin may play an important role in the development of cisplatin induced multi-drug resistance of large cell lung cancer. The loss of the MDM2 binding site and Ser15 phosphorylation site contribute to the abnormal function of the mutated P53. In the p53 signaling pathway, those genes related with apoptosis regulation and DNA repairs such as MDM2, GADD45, MKK4 may also associate with the development of drug resistance. Wild-type p53 gene transfection reverses the drug resistance of large cell lung cancer cell in vitro and in vivo, due to the substitution of the mutated p53.Background Focal ground-glass opacities (GGOs) have been detected increasingly by helical CT. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the characteristics of focal GGOs in order to develop the standard of treatment for these lesions. Methods Between February 2002 and June 2004, Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) was performed for 20 patients with 24 lesions less than or equal to 3 cm in diameter. Preoperative CT guided bronchoscopic marking using Barium sulfate was performed several days before VATS. Wedge resection with fluoroscopy-guided VATS was performed as primary therapy. The GGOs were ensured the presence and surgical margin immediately. Sections of resected tumor were stained by H.E. and Elastica staining, and examined by light microscopy. Results Single lesions were identified in 17 patients, and multiple lesions (range 2 to 3) were in three cases. One patient with multiple lesions displayed bilateral diseases. All patients were asymptomatic, and detected on CT screening. Pathologic diagnoses for 24 lesions were as follows: Atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) in 3 cases, Locarized bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (LBAC) in 19 cases, and organizing pneumonia or inflammatoric changes in 2 cases. Vascular permeation was not found in all LBACs. However, the pleural indentation was existed in 2 cases, those are more than or equal to 2 cm in diameter. Conclusions VATS limited resection for small GGO on CT may be adequate for managing patients displaying small GGOs, especially less than or equal to 2 cm in diameter.ADIkBa TRANSFER REVERSES THE CHEMORESISTANCE TO TAXOL BY INDUCING APOPTOSIS IN NUDE MICE WITH HUMANLUNG CANCER J NI 1 , K TAKAYAMA 2 , N INOSHIMA 2 , T HARADA 2 , T MINAMI 2 , CC ZHOU 1 , Y NAKANISHI 2 1 Department of Oncology, Shanghai Pneumology Hospital, PRC, 2 Research Institute for Diseases of the Chest, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, JapanBackground For most of patients with lung cancer, chemotherapy is the main choice for management. But the dose-related toxicity of chemotherapy agents and chemoresistance result in the ultimate treatment failure. One of the mechanism of chemoresistance is resistance of the tumor to apoptosis. Activated NFkB (Nuclear Factor kB) takes potent role in cell survival through modulating cell-cycle and inhibiting the apoptosis, thus results in resistance to treatment. Objective To investigate the combinated effect of AdIkBa(adenovirus expressed inhibitor kBa, IkBa, the inhibitor of NFkB) transfer and chemotherapy on the human lung cancer cell line H460 in vitro and in vivo. Methods In cultivated cells, 50% of inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of chemotherapy agents were detected singly or combined with AdIkBa trsnsfer. Annexin-V/PI stain and caspase 3 activity measurement were completed to detect the apoptosis caused by treatment. For established tumor, the effect of combination treatment was evaluated. The interaction of NFkB and p53 and that between NFkB and VEGF were analyzed. Results Part of chemotherapy agents we used, including of paclitaxel (taxol) showed significantly decreased IC50 when combined with AdIkBa in cultivated cells?. Annexin V/PI detection showed more apoptotic cells in this system by activating caspase 3 pathway but not related with TNFa secretion. In sub-treated dose, the combinated treatment showed more effective. For established H460 tumors, combinated treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth. Immunohistochemical stain proved increased expression of p65 after taxol single treatment while combination with AdIkBa intratumoral injection eliminated this expression accompanied with the slightly decreased expression of VEGF and stable p53 status. Conclusion Combination of chemotherapy and IkBa could inhibit the tumor growth effectively by blocking the expression of NFkB and inducing apoptosis. It may be simultaneously bate the expression of VEGF but independent of p53. Also, it might reduce the dose of chemotherapy agents and benefit for clinical application.",

Methods Fifty patients fulfilling the following eligibility criteria were enrolled: chemotherapy-naive, good performance status (PS: 0-1), age < 75, stage III, and adequate hematological, hepatic and renal function. Patients' characteristics were as follows: male/female = 40/10; PS 0/1 = 16/34; median age (range) = 62 (41-74); Ad/Sq/Large/Others = 30/16/2/2; stage IIIA/IIIB = 11/39. Based on the phase I study (Eur J Cancer 37:1359, 2001), the patients received CPT-11 60 mg/m 2 i.v. on days 1, 8 and 15, and CDDP 80 mg/m 2 i.v. on day 1 of every 4 weeks. Radiotherapy of 2 Gy/day commenced on day 2 of each chemotherapy cycle, with 28 Gy and 32 Gy administered for the first and second cycle, respectively. Results After 17 pts enrolled, chemotherapy dose were reduced CPT-11 50 mg/m 2 and CDDP 60 mg/m 2 because of low therapy completion rate. Forty-eight patients were assessable for response, toxicity and survival. Forty patients achieved a partial response (PR), 7 showed stable disease (SD), and 1 showed progressive disease (PD). The overall response rate was 83.3% (95%CI, 70.4-91.3%). The rate was 87.5% in 50/60 dose. Grade 4 leukopenia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 21%, 48% and 2%, respectively. Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, pneumonitis, esophagitis and fatigue occurred 19%, 10%, 10% and 19%, respectively. Treatment-related death occurred in one patient who suffered late pneumonitis. The median survival time was 25.1 months, and the 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates were 72.6%, 50.9% and 39.2%, respectively. Conclusion The combination of CPT-11/CDDP with concurrent split-course TRT is well tolerated with a high activity in patients with locally advanced NSCLC.A STUDY OF INHIBITORY EFFECT OF HTERT DNAZYME ON A549/DDP CELL GROWTHBINGXIANG YU, YOUNING LIU, XIAOFEI ZHENGDept. of Respitratory Medicine, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, ChinaObjective This study analyzed the relationship between telomerase activity and drug resistance in A549/DDP cell. The goal of this study was to show the possibility of telomerase as a new target for the treatment of drug resistance lung cancer cell. Method (1) Total RNA was harvested from cultured A549/DDP cell, RT-PCR was performed to detect telomerase RNA and telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) mRNA. Telomerase activity was measured by TRAP (2) Cultured A549/DDP cells were divided into five groups: control, cisplatin, liposome, liposome+hTERT DNAzyme, cisplatin+ liposome+hTERT DNAzyme, then treated for 72 hours. Telomerase activity was measured and cells were counted by MTT to make cell-growth curve. Results (1) Telomerase RNA and hTERT were expressed and telomerase activity was positive in A549/DDP cell. (2) A549/DDP cell telomerase activity was down-regulated by hTERT DNAzyme with a dose range from 4 to 500 nmol/L. (3) A549/DDP cell growth was significantly inhabited by 32.9% and 60.5% after treatment of hTERT DNAzyme at 0.25 umol/L only and hTERT DNAzyme with 3 ug/ml cisplatin for 72 hours, respectively. Conclusion (1) Telomerase inhibitors may treat drug resistant lung cancer cell since the cell express telomerase activity. (2) hTERT inhibits A549/DDP cell growth and has a synergistic effect with cisplatin. It is suggested that telomerase might be a new target for the treatment of drug-resistance lung cancer cell.EFFICACY AND TOLERABILITY OF GEFITINIB IN EDLERLY PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCERXT ZHANG, LY LI, SL WANG, MZ WANG, W ZHONG Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, China Background & Objectives To evaluate the activity and toxicity profile of gefitinib in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients aged 70 years and over.

The ELVIS (Elderly Lung cancer Vinorelbine Italian Study) trial demonstrated the tolerability and efficacy of VNR in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC, although the dosage and period of administration were not established. In this study, we examined the efficacy of VNR in elderly patients with NSCLC for long-term period. Methods From 2002 to 2003, we analyzed, retrospectively, our data about single-agent VNR as a first-line chemotherapy in elderly patients (more than 80 years) with advanced NSCLC treated for more than 6 months. VNR was given intravenously at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 or 25 mg/m 2 on day 1 and 8. The cycle was repeated every 3 weeks until progressive disease. Results In this study, three patients were treated with VNR for more than 6 months. The median age was 86 years (range 85 to 86). The average cycles were 10 cycles, and period of administration was 9 months. The tumor response for all patients was stable disease, and lung cancer related symptoms were improved in all patients. Hematological toxicities were only grade 1/2 bone marrow suppression. Non-hematological toxicities were grade 1 constipation, fatigue and phlebitis. Conclusion VNR possibly improves QoL of elderly patients with NSCLC for administration of long-term period.CYCLOOXYGENASE-2 EXPRESSION CORRELATES WITH ANGIOGENESIS AND VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR IN NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCERCAICUN ZHOU, QIANGHAU YI Department of Oncology, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, 507 Zhengmin Road, 200433, P.

PZA is precursor that must be converted to pyrazinoic acid by the pyrazinamidase. Pyranamidase lose activity that is relate to PZA resistance, so pyrazinamidase gene (pncA) mutation is thought to accord with pyrazinamidase losing activity. But many clinical isolates from China did not find pncA mutation. Methods The tested Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated and its PZA drug susceptibility testing were performed with absolute concentration. The pncA gene was sequenced besides 80 bp of upstream sequence and 35 bp of downstream sequence. Results 76.5% (13/17) PZA-susceptible isolates lacked mutations. The point mutations of pncA gene mainly resulted in nonsense mutation in PZA-susceptible isolates. The pncA gene mutation was identified in 5 of 26 (19.2%) PZA-resistant isolates, and the upstream sequence mutation was identified in 3 of 26 (11.5%) PZA-resistant isolates, and the simultaneous mutation of pncA and its upstream sequence was identified in 6 of 26 (23.1%) PZA-resistant isolates. while 12 (46.2%) PZA-resistant isolates lacked mutations (Table 1). The point mutations of pncA gene resulted in an amino acid substitution, or insertion and deletion mutations of pncA resulted in frame shift. the upstream sequence mutation were deletion, insertion and point mutation. Conclusion pncA gene and its upstream sequence mutation is among molecular mechanism of PZA resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from China. It is suspected that other gene locus relate to of PZA resistance in clinical isolates from China.AN APPROACH TO RAPIDLY DIAGNOSE AND DETECT RIFAMPICIN RESISTANCE IN MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS BASED ON PHAGE-AMPLIFIED BIOLOGICAL ASSAYLI PENG 1 , YONG-AI LUO 1 , GUO-ZHI WANG 2 * 1 Department of Pulmonary, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing University of Medical Sciences, Chongqing, China; 2 Division of Bacteria Vaccine, National Institute for The Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products, Beijing, ChinaBackground Rapid diagnosis and drug susceptibility test of M. tuberculosis is essential to initiate timely and appropriate treatment to curb the spread of TB, which is a potentially life threatening disease. Increase in multidrug resistant M. tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has become a great cause of concern and rifampicin resistance is considered to be a good predictor of MDR-TB. Detection of rifampicin resistance by PhaB (phage-amplified biologically) assay is a useful tool as mycobacteriophage is specific for M. tuberculosis complex and detect viable cells only. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the assay's utilization in diagnosis and detection on rifampicin resistance in M. tuberculosis. Methods The condition of PhaB assay, including various infection times prior to addition of virucide and the effect of the inactivation agents which could inactive the extracellular phages were investigated. We evaluated the clinical utility of this new assay by analyzing 78 specimens including 52 M tuberculosis complex, 19 Non-M. Tuberculosis (NTM) and 7 common bacteria in respiratory system. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of PhaB assay were tested when it was used in rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis. Some important agents of the method, including mycobacteriophage, virucide and help cells, were investigated at different time when they were preserved at 4\u00b0C. Furthermore, 52 M tuberculosis isolates were tested the susceptibility to rifampicin by the PhaB assay and the conventional LJ culture proportion method in order to assess the PhaB assay. Results The optimal infection time of mycobacteriophage prior to addition of virucide was between 3 and 4 h. Four percent FAS (ferrous ammonium sulphate) could inactive 10 9 PFU (plaque-forming unit) in five minutes. The samples were positive when it included 80 and 100 CFU of M. tuberculosis. However, only six NTM isolates might appear few plaques when CFU \u2265 10 6 , other NTM and all the common bacteria isolates were negative. The sensitivity was 100%, specificity was 77% and accuracy was 92.3%. The important agents in this test, such as mycobacteriophage, virucide and help cells could keep optimal effect when they were preserved at 4\u00b0C. Furthermore, the susceptibility to rifampicin of M. tuberculosis by the PhaB assay correctly assigned 94.1% rifampicin-resistant isolates, and 94.4% rifampicin-sensitive isolates. The PhaB assay's concordance with the L-J culture proportion method was 94.2%. Conclusion The method based on phage-amplified biologically could rapidly diagnose and detect tuberculosis, and it was effective, accurate, simple to perform and easy to implement. The PhaB assay correctly identified the rifampicin susceptibility of M. tuberculosis isolates with the results obtained in 2 days. The simplicity, high sensitivity, high specialty and low cost of the assay could make it be performed in those undeveloped countries of the world, compared with a variety of molecular techniques.THE REGULATION OF INTERLEUKIN-7 ON THE PRODUCTION OF TH1 AND TH2 CYTOKINES BY PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS FROM PATIENTS WITH TUBERCULOSISXIAO-MIN YANG, DE-QIONG DONG, YU-HAO YANG Department of Respiratory Medicine, First Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College, Zunyi 563003, China",

It is immune prevention high risk people from developing into patients by M.smegmatis vaccine. (High risk people refer to those who have already been infected with M.tuberculosis and are of strong positive results in PPD test but aren't tuberculosis patients.) Methods The pharmacology and toxicology studies were made by different animal models which include the immune hypofunction, normal and immune heperfunction animals. Then the vaccine's effect and its mechanism and safety were evaluated widely. Results In the prophylactic effect study of M.smegmatis vaccine, after being infected with powerful M.tuberculosis, the pathological changes and bacteria load in guineapigs treated with M.smegmatis vaccine were much minor than these in control guineapigs (The pathological changes and logarithm of the number of M.tuberculosis separated from spleens of guinea-pigs with M.smegmatis vaccine treatment were 27.5 \u00b1 12.0 and 3.98 \u00b1 0.65, and these of control guinea-pigs were 64.6 \u00b1 21.0 and 4.69 \u00b1 0.67. When the treatment group and control group were compared, P < 0.05). In the mechanism studies, M.smegmatis vaccine were found it could promote the recovery of normal immune function in mice with hypofunction, could elevate the Th1 immune response in normal mice and could depress the immune hyperfunction in hypersensitive animals. At the same time, M.smegmatis vaccine's acute toxicity testing, chronical toxicity testing and systematic anaphylaxis experiment were made on mice, Beagle's dogs and guinea-pigs, respectively. There wasn't any toxicity found. Conclusion M.smegmatis vaccine can strengthen the normal cellular immune function, promote the recovery of normal immune function in mice with hypofunction and suppress the immunogical response in animals with hyperfunction. In the guineapigs infected with tubercle bacillus, the multiplication of tubercle bacillus is suppressed significantly and pathological changes of various organs mitigated in turn. And there isn't any toxicity of vaccine found in the experiments. In short, M.smegmatis vaccine is a kind of safe and effective preventive vaccine against high risk people of tuberculosis.THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLYMORPHISMS OF SUSCEPTIBLE GENES IN FIBRINOLYTIC PATHWAY RELATED TO PULMONARYTHROMBOEMBOLISM IN CHINESE HAN POPULATION ZHENGUO ZHAI, CHEN WANG, YUANHUA YANG, YANMEI LIU, JINGZHONG LIU, BAI XIAO, BAOSEN PANG Division of Pulmonary Disease, Beijing Institute of Respiratory Medicine, Beijing Chaoyang hospital, Capital University of Medical Sciences, 100020, Beijing, People's Republic of China",

In the present study, we retrospectively compared patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy for stage II thymoma with patients who did not receive it in terms of their survival rate and relapse-free rate. The effectiveness of postoperative radiotherapy for Masaoka stage II thymoma was investigated. Methods Twenty-nine patients underwent resection of Masaoka stage II thymoma among 97 patients treated for thymoma between October 1983 and February 2002 at Juntendo University School of Medicine. They were from 25 to 76 years old (mean: 48.5 years). The patients were divided into groups with or without postoperative radiotherapy. The survival rate and relapse-free rate were retrospectively compared. Results Seven of the 29 patients died and 4 suffered relapse. Among the 14 patients given postoperative radiotherapy (total dose of 15.4-50.4 Gy, mean: 43.0 Gy), 100%, 83.3%, and 33.3% were alive at 5, 10, and 15 years after surgery, respectively, with relapse-free rates of 100%, 100%, and 50%. For the 15 patients without postoperative radiotherapy, the 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival rates were 91.7%, 76.4%, and 76.4%, respectively, with relapse-free rates of 88.9%, 88.9%, and 44.4%. The patients with and without radiotherapy showed no significant differences of overall survival and relapse-free survival (P = 0.7128 and P = 0.6526, respectively). Conclusions For Masaoka stage II thymoma, the outcome and postoperative course were not significantly influenced by postoperative radiotherapy.THE DECLINE IN FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN ONE SECONDIN CLINICALLY HEALTHY JAPANESE NON-SMOKING WOMEN: A LONGITUDINAL STUDY M NISHITSUJI, M FUJIMURA, Y ORIBE, T KITA, S MYOU, M YASUI, K KASAHARA, S NAKAO Department of Respiratory Medicine, Kanazawa University School of Medicine, JapanBackground Many studies have reported that FEV 1 is decreasing with aging. But little is known about the rate of decline of FEV 1 in Japanese women. We evaluated the longitudinal changes in lung function and the factors associated with FEV 1 changes over time in Japanese female. Methods FEV 1 measures were recorded in 1696 Japanese non-smoking female who took annually medical check involving pulmonary function test from 1995 to 2001.ResultsThe mean values \u00b1 standard deviations of annual decrease in FEV 1 (slope) were 19.6 \u00b1 30.8 mL/year in non-smokers. Multiple regression analysis revealed that initial age, height, and FEV 1 were significant parameters determining the slope. Conclusion This study clearly showed the aging-related longitudinal decline in pulmonary function in Japanese non-smoking women.ANALYSIS OF 198 CASES WITH SARCOIDOSISHAI-QING CHU, HUIPING LI, GUOJUN HERespiratory department, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Shanghai 200433, ChinaObject To know about the clinical features, the changes in radiography, the pathological findings of sarcoidosis and its diagnosis and treatment through cases analysis. Method Analysis 198 patients with confirmed sarcoidosis involved from 1980 and their clinical, radiographic, pathological features and treatment retrospectively. Result (1) There were 125 female patients (63.1%) and 73 male patients (36.9%) with the average age of 40.17 \u00b1 5.28 years old. The duration of disease was 0.12-7.41 years and stage evaluation showed that there were 3, 86, 91 and 18 cases respective from stage 0 to stage 3. (2) Seventy cases (35.4%) were found asymptomaticly by the physical examination, while other 128 patients (64.6%) complained of various symptoms such as cough, breathless, fever, chest pain. The main extrapulmonary manifestation was superficial lymph node enlargement, eyesight faintness, and skin sarcoidosis. (3) The most often seen presentation of the chest X-ray and CT was hilar and/or mediastinal lymph node enlargement accompanying with bilateral diffusion lesion or not. (4) Ninety-eight of 137 cases (71.5%) with the PPD test showed negative response; 194 cases had the serum ACE measurement with 86 cases (44.3%) higher than normal; 93 cases accepted the FOB and 58 cases (62.3%) were found mucous change, among them, 16 patients (17%) showed mucous coarse with yellow-white spots; 17 cases accepted the BAL (bronchial alveolar lavage) and the average CD 4 /CD 8 in BALF was higher; 67 Ga lung scan were accomplished in 92 cases and 86 (93.4%) of them had 67 Ga gathering. Among the various biopsy means, mediastinoscopy lymph node biopsy is the most valuable, and the superficial lymph node, skin nodus, bronchial mucous and transbronchial lung biopsy are worth popularizing. The prognosis is good after accepting corticosteroids treatment, among the followed-up 63 cases, only 15 (23.8%) cases relapsed in 2 years. Conclusion It should be alert to sarcoidosis when the followings happen: middle age or the young female patient; mild respiratory tract symptoms accompanying with superficial lymph node enlargement or skin, eye involved; long duration of the disease; bilateral lung diffusion lesion in radiographic present accompanying with or without hilar, mediastinal lymphadenopathy. To avoid failing to diagnose or mistake diagnosis, we should try our best to confirm the diagnosis through the tissue pathological examination, and the corticosteroid is needed when there have the treatment indication. Once confirmed, the patient should have a long time continuous observation, follow-up periodically and be alert relapsing.A REPORT OF NINETEEN CHINESE PATIENTS WITH DIFFUSE PANBRONCHIOLITISHP LI, HQ CHU, X LI, H YU, L ZHAO, GJ HE Department of Respiratory Diseases, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, P. R. ChinaBackground Diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) is well characterized in Japanese and reported most number of cases by them around the world. But there are less than 100 cases of DPB reported in China so far. Now we report 19 Chinese subjects with DPB who once administrated in our department and followed up. Methods Nineteen Chinese patients (thirteen of male and six of female, mean age 52 \u00b1 12 years) who administrated Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital between July 1 of 2001 and July 20 of 2004 and fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for DPB were assessed retrospectively for their clinical, radiological, arterial gas analysis, lung function, microbiological, response of the therapy, prognosis and other characteristics. Results All subjects presented with chronic cough and eighteen of them (94.7%) with copious purulent sputum production; seventeen of them (89.5%) had dyspnea on exertion. Eleven of them (58%) had wheezes and seventeen of them (89.5%) had end inspiratory crackles in their chest at initial presentation. Sixteen cases (84.2%) had emphysema, seventeen (89.5%) had chronic sinusitis, twelve (63.2%) were smoker, and only one patient had DPB family history. Three subjects (15.8%) had bronchiectasis and four (21.1%) with cor pulmonale. Only four had elevated cold haemagglutinin titers and six had lung biopsy specimens. Two of nine subjects (22.2%) had positive expression of human leukocyte antigen-B54 (HLA-B54). Eight (42%) had positive sputum Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thirteen (68.4%) patients were misdiagnosed as chronic bronchitis and fourteen (73.68%) were misdiagnosed as bronchiectasis initially. Almost all of them experienced a long time to make their diagnosis clear, from nine months to 40 years, equally 8 years. The period of Sixteen out of seventeen (94%) patients with macrolide and steroid therapy had an excellent response, including symptoms, radiological pictures, lung function indices, blood oxygenation and others. Conclusion Our data suggested that there are actually some DPB patients hided in the cohort of chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis and other pulmonary diseases. Chinese doctors have to improve the understanding of DPB and increase our diagnosis level.Background Comprising half of the world's population and 1.2 billion (57% of global) smokers, Asia-Pacific; consisting of the World Health Organisation (WHO) regions of South East (SE) Asia and Western Pacific includes countries with the highest smoking prevalence, tobacco production and consumption, and 1.7 million smoking attributable deaths. We aim to look at recent tobacco trends and control across the region. Method The most recent data from Asia-Pacific countries and member states including population, real gross domestic product (GDP), smoking prevalence, tobacco economy, smoking attributable deaths and tobacco control measures were obtained from the second edition of Tobacco Control Country Profiles. Analyses were performed using T-test and Pearson correlation statistics. Results Of the forty countries and member states reviewed, smoking prevalence was inversely related to both GDP and sponsorship regulations (P < 0.05). Whilst developing countries had significantly higher male and overall smoking prevalence, developed countries consumed significantly more cigarettes per capita and had higher male smoking-related cancer mortality (P < 0.05). Lower male smoking prevalence was associated with greater tobacco sales regulation (P < 0.05). Female smoking prevalence correlated with smoking-attributed cardiovascular (P < 0.01) and respiratory mortality (P < 0.05), and was significantly higher in Western Pacific countries compared with SE Asian counterparts (P < 0.05). Conclusion Despite vigorous efforts in tobacco control, smoking prevalence remains high in the region. Smoking-related mortality has risen notwithstanding a decrease in per capita consumption over the recent five years, suggesting a continuous adverse health impact of tobacco. With the effecting of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, tobacco surveillance still poses a health challenge to the region, requiring long-term political commitment to more vigilance in regulatory infrastructure and legislation.STAPLE LINE REINFORCEMENT AND WRAPPING WITH BIOABSORBABLE FELT TO REDUCE THE AIR LEAKAGE AFTER THORACOSCOPIC SURGERYY KITA 1 , H NOGIMURA 1 , Y OZAWA, M KATO, H HASEGAWA, K NAKAIZUMI, K SUZUKI 2 , T KAZUI 2 Department of Respirology and 1 Thoracic Surgery, Haibara General Hospital, Shizuoka, 2 First Department of Surgery, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, JapanBackground To reduce the postoperative prolonged air leaks and recurrence of pneumothorax, staple-line reinforcement is often needed for the patients, such as severe pneumothorax with emphysema or interstitial pneumonia. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of sutureline wrapping method with polyglycolic acid (PGA) felt for lung resection by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Methods PGA felt wrapping procedures were as follows. After the lung resection with autosutures, we tied 3 to 5 sections of staple line using 1-0 silk and threaded the sheet of PGA through the access port. PGA felt was fixed by 1-0 silk ligatures and 100 mg minocycline (MINO) solution was applied to the PGA sheet. Between January 2003 and June 2004, VATS with PGA felt wrapping were performed for 15 patients (Group A), and VATS without wrapping were 20 (Group B). We compared both groups. Results The average of postoperative drainage period was 1.6 days in group A (range 1 to 4), and 1.9 days in group B (range 1 to 8). The rate of prolonged air leaks (more than or equal to 5 days) was 0% in group A, and 10.0% (2 cases) in group B. One case in group B was needed re-operation for air leakage. Patients treated PGA felt had shorter periods of postoperative drainage. The recurrence rate was 0% in group A, and 5% (1 case) in group B. It was also lower in group A. There was no other postoperative complication and no mortality. Conclusions VATS with PGA felt and MINO is a safe and useful method that may reduce the postoperative chest drainage periods and the recurrence of pneumothorax.CHEST RADIOGRAPHS IN ACUTE PULMONARY EMBOLISM: AN EXPERIENCE AT A TERTIARY CARE CENTRE IN PAKISTANALI BIN SARWAR ZUBAIRI, MUHAMMAD IRFAN, KULSOOM FATIMA, MUHAMMAD ATIF ZUBAIRI, SYED FAYYAZ HUSSAIN Pulmonary Section, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, PakistanObjective To determine the Chest X-Ray presentation of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) in Pakistani adults presenting to a tertiary care hospital. Methods A retrospective observational study in 50 proven cases of acute pulmonary embolism on Spiral CT Scan of the Chest demonstrating an intraluminal filling defect. Hospital records of patients with a diagnosis of Acute PE were reviewed from January 2000 till March 2004. Two chest physicians independently reviewed the chest radiographs. If there was any disagreement on Chest X-ray findings, the films were reviewed by Radiologist for final interpretation. Results The risk factors for developing acute PE was present in 58% of patients. The chest radiograph were interpreted as normal in only 18% of patients with PE. The most common chest radiographic abnormalities were cardiac enlargement (46%), pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates (46%), atelectasis (32%), pleural effusion (29%), pulmonary congestion (29%), elevated hemidiaphragm (17%), pulmonary artery enlargement (17%), and oligemia (the Westermark sign 10%). Conclusions Cardiomegaly is the most common chest radiographic abnormality associated with acute pulmonary embolism. Our findings are consistent with findings reported from developed countries. Although chest radiographs are essential in the investigation of suspected PE, their main value is to exclude diagnoses that clinically mimic PE.CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND OUTCOME OF PATIENTS WITH ACUTE PULMONARY EMBOLISM FROMA DEVELOPING COUNTRY ALI BIN SARWAR ZUBAIRI, MUHAMMAD IRFAN, KULSOOM FATIMA, MUHAMMAD ATIF ZUBAIRI, SYED FAYYAZ HUSSAIN Pulmonary Section, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, PakistanObjective To determine the clinical profile and outcome of patients with Acute Pulmonary embolism (APE) in a developing country.

The nodules usually show multiple rather than solitary in pulmonary parenchyma adjacent to pleura. FDG-PET is available to differentiate pulmonary nodules from malignancy tumors. Methods We performed FDG-PET on four patients with pulmonary rheumatoid nodules. Next, we investigated chest CT of RA patients (n = 50), retrospectively. Results All four patients had nodules shown significant positive in FDG-PET. Thoracoscopic biopsy reveled benign rheumatoid nodules on three patients. On the rest one, the nodules regressed over the three months after the predonisolone administration without histological diagnosis. Fourteen patients (28%) had pulmonary nodules in chest CT. Eleven of fourteen patient reveled multiple nodules. Conclusion Pulmonary rheumatoid nodule is supposed to be one of the most frequent pulmonary complications of the RA. FDG-PET is not useful to differentiate rheumatoid nodules from malignancy tumors.APPLICATION OF COMPUTER VIDEO FREQUENCY SYSTEM IN AUTOMATICALLY TRACING AND ANALYZING LIVING CELLSMIAOFANG LIU, JUN XU, NANSHAN ZHONG Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical College, Guangzhou, ChinaBackground It is necessary to develop a system that can trace dynamic change of living cells under microenvironment. In this study, a computer aided real-time tracing and analyzing system of living cells video frequency images was established. It provides researchers a convenient facility to investigate the mechanisms regarding behavior variation and instant signal transduction in living cells under different pathophysiologic conditions. Materials and Method The automatic tracing and analyzing video frequency system consists of an inverted fluorescence microscope (Leica DMIRB), a CCD adaptor (MINTRON 1132c), a pentium 4 computer, a blackand-white video capture (10 M 4-Video Capture) as well as a thermostasis incubator. Software of the system is based on Microsoft Windows 98/2000. It was compiled with the object-oriented Visual C ++ advanced computer language. Other materials required are expression vector, primers, and reagents for molecular cloning and transgene etc.ResultsThe system contains four major functional module, real-time cells image capture, cells migration tracing, cell acreage, luminosity and quantity calculation, experimental chart report and data output management. Operators can set global and interval time of image capture, as well as label the target cells. The system automatically completes all the image capture missions according to the predefined configuration. Thus locus and speed of the cell movement can be determined. For every captured cell image, the damage acreage variation of single cells layer undergo partial injury can be calculated automatically, luminosity variation of target cells transfected with interesting gene fused with reporter gene encoding fluorescent protein can be detected under different conditions, and transcription activated cells counting also can be performed. The playback pictures can display whole outline variation process of the scrape area lively. Finally, all the associated analytic chart materials were exported. Conclusion With this system, we constructed a bronchial epithelial cells injury study model by using green fluorescence protein as a tracer, observed and recorded all information regarding repair procedure of damaged epithelial cells, analyzed the effect to cell repair elementarily, while the intra/extra cellular environment changed. It provides a valuable study model to evaluate the effect of drugs for respiratory diseases on pathophysiological action of airway epithelial cells.LONG-TERM CHANGE OF PULMONARY FUNCTION IN PATIENTS OF CHRONIC BERYLLIUM DISEASEWENLAN YANG, DONG ZHU, JINMING LIU Shanghai pulmonary hospital, Shanghai 200433Purpose To study the long term change of pulmonary function in patients of chronic beryllium disease (CBD). Methods Between 1998 to 2004, 12 patients of CBD were observed. The median patients age was 55 years (the age ranges from 40 to 70). All patients were men and they were exposured to beryllium 5-29 years. 5 of them received corticosteroids. Pulmonary function tests were obtained every 2 years for all patients. Patient's sequential examinations were compared with their initial data. Results Among all patients, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ), forced expiratory volume (FVC), FEV 1 /FVC and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (D L CO) were statistically significant impaired. FVC, FEV 1 , FEV 1 /FVC respectively decreased by 27%, 39%, 18% at 6 years. DLCO was very lower when patients were diagnosed CBD, and decreased 21% at 6 years. Among those who received corticosteroids, the loss of FEV 1 , FVC, FEV1/FVC, DLCO were smaller than that of patients who did not receive corticosteroids. Conclusion The lesion on pulmonary function in CBD patients is obvious. The value of DLCO is very lower than the normal one. The treatment with corticosteroids is usually beneficial in early stage.INDUCTION OF INTERLEUKIN-1 BETA AND TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR ALPHA IN U937 CELLS EXPOSED TO HYPOXIA IS MEDIATED BY PKC ALPHA AND RAF-1 KINASEGM WU, Z XU, GS QIAN 1 , Q XUE, SW WANG 2 1 Institute of Respiratory Disease, Xingqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 2 Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, General Hospital of PLA, Beijing, China",

Lung function varies with ethnicity and may also change over time with changes in environmental factors affecting lung development. The aim of the study was to establish update prediction formulae of spirometric parameters for Hong Kong Chinese and to compare the reference values with those derived from other studies on Caucasians and Chinese. Methods Subjects were recruited by random digit dialing, and 70% of respondents who fulfilled recruitment criteria participated. Spirometry was performed according to American Thoracic Society recommendations and the technique was standardized among the eight participating lung function laboratories. Results Evaluable data was obtained from 1089 (494 males and 595 females) healthy non-smokers aged 18 to 80 years. Age and height were found to be the major determinants of spirometric values with a linear decline of height-adjusted values of FEV 1 and FVC with age in both sexes. Spirometric values of this population have increased compared to Chinese populations of similar sex, age and height two decades ago. Reference values based on recommended adjustments of data derived from Caucasian populations overestimated the predicted spirometric parameters by about 5-19%. Conclusion Our findings underscore the need to use reference values based on updated data derived from local populations or those matched for ethnicity and other demographic characteristics.

This study is to apply capsaicin provocation test by dosimeter method and assess its safety in Chinese people for the first time. Methods Capsaicin inhalation cough challenge test by dosimeter method was performed on 56 healthy volunteers, 11 subjects with upper respiratory infection (URI), 10 patients with eosinophilic bronchitis (EB) and 10 patients with asthma. Each subject inhaled progressively doubling concentrations of capsaicin (0.98 ~1000 mmol/L) by a breath-activated dosimeter until the concentration inducing five or more coughs (C5) was reached. The LogC5 was calculated as the cough receptors sensitivity. General lung ventilation and impedance with impulse oscillometry (ISO) were measured before and follow cough provocation test. Results There was no serious uncomfortable complaint about the test in all subjects, while 2 subjects (2.3%) complained about slight nausea and 1 subject (1.1%) felt heartburned and 1 subject (1.1%) was hoarse. Indexes of ventilation (FEV 1 , FVC, FEV 1 /FVC, MMEF) and impedance (Zrs, Fres, R5, R20, R5-R20, X5) didn't significantly change after the cough provocation test in each group. The mean LogC5 value in subjects with EB (1.59 \u00b1 0.71) was significantly lower than normal subjects (2.52 \u00b1 0.37, P < 0.01), URI (2.51 \u00b1 0.66, P < 0.05) and asthma (2.34 \u00b1 0.56, P < 0.05).

China, 2 Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Dept. of Medicine, and Dept. of Biological Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, USABackground While focused on regulatory mechanisms of AQP1 we found unexpectedly that Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) can induce AQP1 expression of Balb/C fibroblast. It has been found that extracellular signalregulated kinases (ERK) was activated by some pathogens. So we want to know if ERK signal pathway involve in AQP1 induction induced by S. aureus. Methods We examined the effects of bacteria infection with S. aureus on expression of AQP1 in Balb/C fibroblasts natively expressing AQP1. Inoculation of fibroblasts cultures with 1 \u00a5 10 10 S. aureus. Immunoblots of cell lysates were probed for the activated forms of the ERK, JNK and p38 MAP kinases at intervals following inoculation of fibroblasts with S. aureus. Pretreatment of the cells with the MEK1/2 inhibitors PD98059 or U0126. Results Inoculation of fibroblast cultures with S. aureus produced up to a nine-fold increase in AQP1 protein expression within 6 hours. ERK was selectively activated in Balb/C fibroblasts within 15 minutes of exposure to bacteria. ERK activation by S. aureus could be inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with PD98059 or U0126. These agents also blocked AQP1 induction in this model. Conclusion ERK activation is a necessary signal step in AQP1 induction of Balb/C fibroblast induced by S. aureus. These data provide the first evidence of a direct effect of bacteria infection on AQP expression.HEMODYNAMIC EFFECTS OF CONTINUOUS POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE ON ACUTE CARDIOGENIC PULMONARY EDEMA IN DOGSNINGFANG LIAN 1 , LEI ZHU, SHANFU NIU Pulmonary department, Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University,1 The First Teaching Hospital of Fujian Medical University, China",

It is well known that the blood levels of AN in healthy subjects are higher than those in obese subjects. Weight loss in patients with chronic respiratory failure (CRF) is a major complication, and is an important determinant of the survival prognosis. Therefore, we hypothesized that the blood levels of AN might be further higher than in healthy subjects, and that it might play a role for body weight loss. Methods In 11 subjects with CRF (male: female = 3 : 8, Age: 52.8 \u00b1 9.7 years). The body composition analysis using bioelectrical impedance analysis (In Body\u00ae), biochemical measurements of the blood, and pulmonary function tests were performed. AN was assayed by validated sandwich ELISA using an adiponectin-specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibody. Insulin resistance was calculated by the homeostasis assessment (HOMA-R). All the subjects were clinically stable at the time point of those measurements. Results AN concentration is negatively correlated with body mass index (BMI) and fat mass (P < 0.05), but not with body fat mass, insulin resistance, or any parameters of lung functions. The patients with extremely high AN level had low levels of BMI. Conclusion Adiponectin is a candidate for one of major contributors of weight loss in patients with chronic respiratory failure. Background Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis (PAM) is a rare disease characterized by widespread laminated calcispherites in alveolar spaces in the absence of any known disorder of calcium metabolism. Although the pathogenesis is unknown, one possibility is that it is an inborn error of metabolism, and thus is regarded as a hereditary lung disease. In presumption of autosomal recessive trait we are trying to clone the responsible gene for the disease. Method Genomic DNA from patients who suffered from PAM and consanguineous marriage in their family tree were analyzed by SNP chips obtained from Affymetrix.",

Background Respiratory diseases may cause considerable disability in the elderly because of their limited respiratory reserve related to ageing. This study aims to study the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and diseases in the elderly Chinese in Hong Kong. Methods A telephone survey was conducted by random household telephone interview from November to December, 2003. Subjects with age \u226570 years were asked to complete a respiratory questionnaire 1 . Subjects were subsequently invited to undergo lung function (spirometry, bronchial challenge) and skin prick tests. Results 1522 subjects (697 male and 823 female) completed the telephone interview. The mean age was 76.4 \u00b1 5.6 years old with 71.1%, 17.2% and 11.7% being non-smokers, ex-smokers and current smokers respectively. At lease one respiratory symptom was identified in 673 (44.2%) subjects. The most frequently reported symptoms were morning phlegm (33.9%), breathless at rest during the day (12.3%) and wheeze over the past 12 months (12.2%). Of the self-reported respiratory diseases, 2.8%, 5.7%, 7.7% and 3.1% had history of tuberculosis, asthma, chronic bronchitis and emphysema respectively. Of the 174 subjects with asthma, chronic bronchitis or emphysema, 96 (55.2%) had sought medical advice in the past 12 months. Among the 153 subjects who had undergone lung function testing, 17 and 13 subjects had FEV1 <80% and <70% predicted respectively. Positive bronchial challenge and skin prick test were identified in 14.3% and 19.6% of subjects respectively. Conclusion Respiratory symptoms, chronic respiratory diseases, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and skin atopy were common among Hong Kong elderlies.

Method The murine model of ALI was estabalished by the method of 'two hit', instillation of little acid and subsequent lipopolysaccharide into lungs. Immunohistochemical techniques was uesd to detect the expressions of Raf-1, MEK-1, Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phosphorylated-ERK (P-ERK) and iNOS, TNF-a, and compare them with control group. Results In the experimental rat lungs, MEK-1, ERK and P-ERK were intensively expressed, but Raf-1 expression was relatively weak. In addition to their expression, the stronger expression of iNOS and TNF-a were seen in the same lung area. Nevertheless, only the minimal exprssions of these kinases were detected in normal control lungs and few cells showed immunoreactivity staining, especially Raf-1 and P-ERK. The control lung expressed lower levels of iNOS and TNF-a than ALI. Significant differences were noted in the experimental and control groups (P < 0.05). Conclusion Raf-1 to MEK-1 to MAPK signal transduction system were activated in the lungs of ALI rat, with the elevated expression of inflammatory mediator NO, TNF-a. The activation of Raf-1 to MEK1-1 to MAPK could lead to the activation of polymorphonuclear neutrophile and macrophage which synthesised and secreted NO, TNF-a.",

The intima thicken and neointima appeared (pulmonary vascular remodeling). MMP-9, TIMP-1 and PDGF-BB were expressed in the SMCs, endothelial cells of embolic vessel and neointima in the PTEs. The expressions reached its culmination at the 3rd and 7th d respectively and became weak at the 14th d. The expression of a-SMA was seen in the cells of the neointima of the embolic vessel. Conclusion PTE could lead to the hyperplasia of endothelial cells, the destruction of IEM. SMCs migrate into the subintimal area and cause the occurrence of neointima and vascular remodeling. The lopsided development of MMP-9/TIMP-1 involve in the pulmonary vascular remodeling associated with PTE.",
