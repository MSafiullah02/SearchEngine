Longer dosage of IFN gives rise to nasal symptoms and signs such as bloodstained nasal discharge. More effective IFNs and regimes are therefore needed. IFNii' is active but the degree to which it will irritate the nose is unknown. Combining IFNs with synthetic antiviral drugs can produce synergistic increases in antiviral activity. It is suggested that these increases may be exploited in future experiments.",

It was realized early on that interferons (IFNs), produced by human or similar cells would be needed but early attempts to produce and use them were unsuccessful or only partially successful. However advantage was taken of Cantell's ability to make IFN from human buffy coat cells and enough IFN was administered to show that repeated intranasal sprays would prevent rhinovirus infections of volunteers and also the common colds they cause (Merigan et al., 1973) . (Table I ). The material was very impure, but later when the NK2 monoclonal antibody became available it was possible to produce the same prophylactic effect with similar IFN freed of all detectable impurities (Scott et al., 1982b) .",

This was important first because it protected against rhinoviruses, proving that the antiviral effect was due to IFN and not to some unrecognized contaminant (Scott et al., 1982a) , and second because experiments were no longer limited by lack of IFN. Later it was shown that IFNa also protected against corona-virus 'colds' (Higgins et al., 1983) and that lymphoblastoid IFN protected against rhinovirus' colds' and also against influenza A infections, though less well (Phillpotts et al., 1984) . The observations on rhinovirus infections of volunteers and recombinant IFNa2 have been confirmed in other centres, and it is also confirmed that influenza infections are less susceptible. Attempts to treat colds by administering IFN sprays after symptoms developed have so far been unsuccessful. These results have been confirmed by a number of volunteer studies in the U.S.A.",

't. Scott & Tyrrell, 1985) . A sufficient dose of IFN does indeed prevent infection, but that dose also produces, after two weeks or so, unacceptable nasal stuffiness, irritation and discharge, and sometimes epithelial ulcers and spotting with blood. This is understandable since IFNs are all apparently pleiotropic substances with many of the effects of lymphokines and they induce inflammation when injected intradennally. However, the unwelcome conclusion is that although they are nontoxic in vitro in clinical use against mild upper respiratory infections they have a therapeutic index of about one.",

The first point to make is that so far we have tested only natural mixtures of IFNa or cloned IFNa2. There might well be another natural IFN that produces less inflammation at the dose required to prevent infection. Since a reduction of only two-or three-fold in the dose of IFN almost eliminates the local adverse effects the ratio of another molecular species may need to be increased only a few fold in order for it to be acceptable in clinical use.",

We propose to examine IFNy in the same way. Of course, by generating hybrid IFN molecules, or modified proteins, following site-directed mutations in the genes, or by chemical synthesis of alternative molecules it might be possible to produce a wide range oflFN-like molecules, some of which could have the desired combination of properties. The problem is that chemistry and genetics have advanced very rapidly but we still have no validated biological test for the characteristics of the IFN molecule which are responsible for the undesirable effects. Until suitable tests are found it will not be possible to select rationally from the many molecules now available, or which could be generated, the one or two which should be investigated clinically.",

L. Ahmed (personal communication) has found that synergy between antirhinovirus drugs can often be detected in vitro and among the most striking examples are the enhancement of both activities which is produced by combining IFNs and dichloroflavan, the chalcone Ro 09-0410 or enviroxime. The enhancement is shown by reduction of cytopathic effect and decrease in virus yield both from tissue cultures and from organ cultures of human respiratory epithelial cells. The effect is seen over a wide range of concentrations of both drugs and can be large in size -for instance there is at least as much reduction in virus yield on combining 1/64 MIC of enviroxime with 1/64 of IFNa as there is with one MIC of each alone. There is no evidence of enhanced toxicity in cells treated with the combination.",
