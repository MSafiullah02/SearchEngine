It is estimated that around one billion individuals suffer from one or more parasitic infections, with the greatest causes of morbidity being attributed to the trypanosomatid parasites. A variety of Leishmania organisms (approximately 20 species) are reported to cause disease which has afflicted about 12 million people in 98 countries of which Indian subcontinent, Sudan and Brazil are the major regions with more incidence of leishmaniasis (Balana-Fouce et al., 1998, Dorlo et al., 2012). The estimated annual number of new cases of leishmaniasis is 2 million, which is usually fatal. Currently, no vaccines are available against this disease, which necessitates the development of alternate strategies to limit its transmission and infection (Modabber, 2010).",

The results of the present study showed in vitro growth suppression of L. donovani promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes by GA. Our results indicate that the GA exerts its antileishmanial action by significant reduction in the parasite viability at concentrations far below the cytotoxic concentration. It was earlier reported that 50 \u03bcg/mL of GA reduced the parasite burden up to 90% in L. donovani infected murine peritoneal macrophages and \u223c10 \u03bcg/mL resulted in 50% inhibition (Bhattacharjee et al., 2012). The results showed that GA displayed antileishmanial activity at non-cytotoxic concentrations. The standard drug miltefosine exhibited \u223c2 fold higher sensitivity against promastigotes and \u223c5 fold higher sensitivity against amastigotes when compared to GA. However, the selectivity index was >5 for GA and almost comparable to miltefosine. The sensitivity of promastigotes, amastigotes and macrophages towards miltefosine was in agreement with the previously published data (Corral et al., 2014, Calogeropoulou et al., 2008, Dube et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Earlier studies showed that HMGR mRNA expression was markedly decreased in GA treated dyslipidemic hamsters (Maurya and Srivastava, 2011). Keeping this in view, effect of GA was studied on recombinant HMGR and native enzyme in promastigotes. At 100 \u03bcM concentration of GA, the recombinant LdHMGR activity was reduced by 90%. Interestingly, it was found that GA inhibits the recombinant enzyme at an IC50 value, which is close to the IC50 value obtained from cell based inhibition studies. This suggested that GA might specifically bind to LdHMGR enzyme. HMGR activity was also measured in GA treated L. donovani promastigotes where \u223c30% reduction was observed. It was observed that the recombinant enzyme inhibition by GA was more compared to inhibition of native enzyme in L. donovani promastigotes (50% inhibition of recombinant HMGR at 24 \u03bcM of GA whereas only 30% inhibition of native HMGR in L. donovani promastigotes was observed at 34 \u03bcM of GA concentration). The differences in effect of GA on the recombinant enzyme activity and that of parasite enzyme activity may be due to the multi-targeted effect of GA (Bhattacharjee et al., 2012). Moreover, the effect of GA in promastigotes was measured on the whole cell lysate of parasite and not purified native HMGR enzyme. In both the native and recombinant HMGR inhibition studies, atorvastatin was used as chemical inhibitor of HMGR enzyme and acted as positive control. Fivefold lower HMGR expression was observed in immunoblot, which further indicated the specificity of GA for HMGR. Thus, the reduction of HMGR enzyme activity is associated with the reduction of HMGR protein levels. AceCS was selected as control protein however if GA has multitargeted effect, proteomics can provide more information regarding other targets. We also confirmed that GA treatment reduces the biosynthesis of ergosterol by inhibiting HMGR enzyme. Ergosterol levels in GA treated wild type promastigotes significantly decreased up to 40% whereas only 20% reduction was observed in GA treated HMGR overexpressors. This explains that it affects the sterol biosynthesis in the parasite and is one of the reasons for parasite killing. Moreover, when attempts were made to reverse the GA mediated growth inhibition with ergosterol, it could only partially revive the growth. This study clearly indicated that though GA acts by inhibiting LdHMGR enzyme and altering ergosterol levels, yet it is not the sole target for GA. It was well documented that GA has multiple mechanism of actions and multiple targets in the parasite. Recent report stated that it inhibits cox-2 enzyme leading to increase NO generation in L. donovani infected macrophages and thus arresting parasite survival (Bhattacharjee et al., 2012).",

Our results indicated that HMGR overexpressing parasites showed \u223c2 fold resistance towards GA mediated inhibition of promastigotes compared to non-transgenic parasites. Therefore, it is illustrated that episomal expression of HMGR in parasites protects them from GA induced lysis as is evident from the higher concentration of GA required to inhibit the transgenic parasites than the wild type parasites.",

However, changes in sterol profile have been linked to amphotericin B and fluconazole resistance (Mbongo et al., 1998, Roberts et al., 2003). The alteration of sterol levels could have important implications in drug response because ergosterol is required for action of some drugs. For example, amphotericin B, a polyene antifungal drug is also used for the treatment of leishmaniasis, which associates, with ergosterol for its action (Croft et al., 2006, Cohen, 1998).",

Overall mode of action of GA in vitro studies is via inhibition of HMGR enzyme (rate limiting enzyme of sterol biosynthetic pathway) and depletion of ergosterol levels, which culminates in parasite death. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report, which conclusively proves that GA can be used as potential inhibitor of L. donovani HMGR, and is an interesting molecule as it possesses immunomodulatory properties too.",
