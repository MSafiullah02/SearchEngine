            "text": "Rhinoviruses are the cause of around 60% of upper respiratory infections (Papadopoulos and Johnston, 1998). Although a connection between upper respiratory infections and asthma exacerbations has long been recognised, its importance was underestimated until recently, when it was demonstrated that in the community, 85% of asthma attacks in children (Johnston et al., 1995) and 44% in adults (Nicholson et al., 1993) are precipitated by upper respiratory infections. One of the main reasons leading to this observation has been the increased sensitivity offered by the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detecting rhinovirus infections. Standard cell culture-based methods are time-consuming and relatively insensitive for a number of viruses, especially rhinoviruses and coronaviruses (Pattemore et al., 1992), therefore several groups are undertaking currently the task of improving and evaluating PCR-based techniques for these viruses.",

As no important differences in clinical presentation are known to exist between these serotypes, conserved areas of the rhinovirus genome near the 5\u2032 untranslated end have been used most frequently as primers (Mori and Clewley, 1994). Unfortunately, most of these areas are also conserved between the other members of the picornavirus family, most notably enteroviruses. To differentiate rhinoviruses from other picornaviruses several approaches have been suggested, including probe hybridisation, PCR-ELISA, nested PCR and sequencing of PCR amplicons (Ireland et al., 1993, Johnston et al., 1993, Mori and Clewley, 1994, Freymuth et al., 1997). However, the use of these methods increases technical demands in terms of both time and cost, without offering, in most cases, an ideal specificity.",

Such a site was either not present, or positioned differently in other picornaviruses of known sequence (Table 1\n). Therefore, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of picornavirus amplicons using BglI, would result in two equal length fragments in rhinoviruses, generating a single 190-bp band in gel electrophoresis. In contrast either one undigested 380-bp band or a double-band pattern would appear in amplicons from other picornaviruses. To test this hypothesis, OL26\u2013OL27 amplicons from 18 cultured and 32 wild-type rhinoviruses whose identity was confirmed by acid stability, as well as amplicons from 34 enteroviruses were digested with BglI. The method was compared with a semi-nested RT-PCR approach (Ireland et al., 1993) for the differentiation of these viruses.",

For the titration assay, Ohio HeLa cells, obtained from the MRC Common Cold Unit were seeded 2 days prior to infection in 96-well plates, reaching 60\u201370% confluence at the time of infection. Eagle\u2019s MEM supplemented with 4% fetal calf serum, 2 mM l-glutamine, 10 mM Hepes (Gibco, Uxbridge, UK), 0.088% sodium bicarbonate, 30 mM magnesium chloride, 0.13% tryptose phosphate broth, and 40 \u03bcg/ml gentamycin (Sigma, Poole, UK) was used. Cultures were carried out in a humidified, 5% CO2 incubator at 33\u00b0C. Titrations were undertaken in quadruplicate, by logarithmic dilutions of the viruses to 1:10\u22129. Titration plates were inspected microscopically daily for up to 7 days for the development of cytopathic effect (CPE), after which they were fixed and stained by 5% formaldehyde, 5% ethanol, 0.1% crystal violet in PBS, and the endpoint titre was read, defined as the highest dilution at which CPE was detected in half of the wells (TCID50) and expressed as the inverse logarithm of this dilution. Acid treatment of rhinoviruses results in at least a 100-fold decrease in titre, while enteroviruses are minimally if at all affected.",

The BglI restriction site, identified in maps of cloned rhinoviruses, is ideally placed in the middle of the amplicon in rhinoviruses, while it is either not present or differently positioned in enteroviruses (Table 1), resulting in easily identifiable patterns after standard gel electrophoresis. When 84 rhinovirus and enterovirus serotypes, as well as community-derived wild type viruses were tested, the theoretical prediction was confirmed in all but two cases. Interestingly, the number of enterovirus strains producing a double-band pattern was somewhat higher (\u223c26%) than that anticipated from the currently available sequences, where less than 20% include a BglI site. Furthermore, in some instances this pattern was obtained from enterovirus serotypes that, according to their sequence, should not possess such a site. This could possibly be attributed to an increased genetic variability of that area in enteroviruses, in contrast to the highly conserved sequence in rhinoviruses. Nevertheless this variability does not seem to affect the ability of the method to differentiate rhinoviruses from enteroviruses, since the different positioning of the BglI site is the crucial factor.",
