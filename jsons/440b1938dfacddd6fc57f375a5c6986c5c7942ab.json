The highly flexible S-protein, with its mobile domains, presents a moving target to the immune system. Here, to better understand S-protein mobility, we implemented a structure-based vector analysis of available \u03b2-CoV S-protein structures. We found that despite overall similarity in domain organization, different \u03b2-CoV strains display distinct S-protein configurations. Based on this analysis, we developed two soluble ectodomain constructs in which the highly immunogenic and mobile receptor binding domain (RBD) is locked in either the all-RBDs 'down' position or is induced to display a previously unobserved in SARS-CoV-2 2-RBDs 'up' configuration. These results demonstrate that the conformation of the S-protein can be controlled via rational design and provide a framework for the development of engineered coronavirus spike proteins for vaccine applications.",

Together these domains cap the S2 domain, protecting the conserved fusion machinery. Several structures of soluble ectodomain constructs that retain the complete S1 domain and the surface exposed S2 domain have been determined. These include SARS-2 1,3 , SARS 4-8 , MERS 4, 9 , and other human 2,10 and murine 11 \u03b2-CoV spike proteins. These structures revealed remarkable conformational heterogeneity in the S-protein spikes, especially in the RBD region. Within a single protomer, the RBD could adopt a closed 'down' state ( Figure 1A) , in which the RBD covers the apical region of the S2 protein near the C-terminus of the first heptad repeat (HR1), or an open 'up' state in which the RBD is dissociated from the apical central axis of S2 and the NTD. Further, cryo-EM structures strongly suggest a large degree of domain flexibility in both the 'down' and 'up' states in the NTD and RBD. While these structures have provided essential information to identify the relative arrangement of these domains, the degree to which conformational heterogeneity may be altered via mutation during the natural evolution of the virus and in a vaccine immunogen design context remains to be determined.",

            "text": "To characterize the unique arrangement of distinct domains in the \u03b2-CoV spike, we first aimed to develop a precise quantitative definition of their relative positions. Examination of available SARS and MERS S-protein structures revealed: 1) the NTD and RBD subdomains and internal S2 domain move as rigid bodies, and 2) these domains display a remarkable array of relative shifts between the domains in the S1 region and the S2 region's \u03b2-sheet motif and connector domain (CD) ( Figure 1B-F) . In order to quantify these movements, we have analyzed the relevant regions of motion and their structural disposition in all available \u03b2-CoV ectodomain spike structures including 15 SARS 4,5,7,8 , 10 MERS 4,12 , a HKU1 2,10 , an OC43 2,10 , a murine \u03b2-CoV, and three SARS-2 13,14 structures (Figures 1E-F and 2). Each protomer in those structures displaying asymmetric 'up'/down' RBD states was examined independently yielding a dataset of 76 structural states. The NTD was split into a primary N-terminal section and a secondary C-terminal section based upon visual inspection of this region in the various \u03b2-CoV structures ( Figures 1B-C and 2) . We next analyzed S-protein geometry using a vector-based approach. Specifically, vectors connecting each region's C\u03b1 centroids were generated and used to define the relative dispositions of the domains ( Figure 1C and 2). The vector magnitudes and select angles and dihedrals were used to identify the breadth of differences in domain positioning and compare between strains. The results indicated that \u03b2-CoV spike proteins in various strains differ markedly from one another and that considerable variability in the domain arrangements within strains exists, especially in the SARS ectodomains (Figures 1E-F and 2A-H). In particular, both 1 and \u02781 (Figure 2A-B) , describing the angle between the SD2 to SD1 and SD1 to RBD vectors as well as the SD1 to RBD dihedral, respectively, effectively report on the 'up' and 'down' configurations while indicating substantial differences between SARS and MERS in both the 'up' and 'down' states. The angular disposition of the NTD elements further indicated differences in SARS and MERS with a particularly marked shift from the examined \u03b2-CoV spikes in the murine structure ( Figure 1E ). Additional S1 differences are observed between vectors involving SD2. The disposition of the S2 domain relative to S1 defined by the dihedral about the vector connecting SD2 to the S2 CD differs markedly between MERS/SARS-2 and SARS as well with the angle between the vectors connecting the NTD' to SD2 and SD2 to the CD demonstrating a shift in SARS-2. Finally, the disposition of the CD to the inner portion of S2 measured as an angle between a vector connected to an interior S2 \u03b2-sheet motif and the vector connecting the CD to SD2 indicates SARS differs from both MERS and SARS-2. Interestingly, the MERS disposition appears to respond to RBD triggering, displaying a bimodal distribution. These results demonstrate that, while the individual domain architectures and overall arrangements are conserved ( Figure 1D ), important differences between these domains exists between strains, suggesting that subtle differences in inter-domain contacts could play a major role in determining these distributions and thereby alter surface antigenicity and the propensity of the domains to access 'up' and 'down' RBD states.",

To this end, we identified protomer to protomer interactive sites amenable to modification and down selected mutations at these sites using the Schr\u00f6dinger Biologics suite 38, 39, 40 . In an effort to eliminate exposure of the receptor binding site of the RBD, we examined the potential for disulfide linkages between the RBD and its contact with S2 near the C-terminus of HR1 to prevent RBD exposure. We identified a double cysteine mutant, S383C and D985C (RBD to S2 double mutant; rS2d; Supplemental Figure S1 ), as a candidate for achieving this goal. The transition from the 'down' state to the 'up' state involves shifts in the RBD to NTD contacts. Therefore, in an effort to prevent these shifts, we identified a site in an RBD groove adjacent to the NTD for which we prepared a triple mutant, D398L, S514L, and E516L (RBD to NTD triple mutant; rNt, Supplemental Figure S1 ). As SD1 acts as a hinge point for the RBD 'up'/'down' transitions (Figures 1A-C, 2I-J), we hypothesized that enhanced hydrophobicity at the SD1 to S2 interface might shift the position of SD1, thus influencing the hinge and potentially the propensity for RBD triggering. A double mutant, N866I and A570L (Subdomain 1 to S2 double mutant; u1S2d, Supplemental Figure S1 ), as well as quadruple mutant, A570L, T572I, F855Y, and N856I (Subdomain 1 to S2 quadruple mutant; u1S2q), were identified for this purpose. Finally, we asked whether linking SD2 to S2 would alter the conformational distribution of the RBDs. The double cysteine mutant, G669C and T866C (Subdomain 1 to S2 double mutant; u2S2d, Supplemental Figure S1 ), was identified for this purpose. These mutants were prepared in the context of a previously published SARS-2 ectodomain construct 3 .",

The mutant spikes were analyzed using a similar workflow as the unmutated spike. All of the mutants displayed well-formed spikes in the micrographs, as well as in the 2D class averages. Following 3D classification, for the rS2d construct, we observed only the 'down' conformation; the 1-RBD 'up' state that was seen for the unmutated spike was not found in this dataset. The u1S2q mutant presented another striking finding, where we observed a new conformational state with 2 RBDs in the 'up' position. The 2-RBD 'up' state has been reported before for the MERS CoV spike ectodomain 12 but has not been observed thus far for either the SARS or the SARS-2 spikes.

Indeed, recent evidence for a mutation in the SD2 to S2 contact region suggests a potential fitness gain for acquisition of such interfacial residues 29 . Based upon our results, this mutant, D614G, may indeed alter the conformational landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein. as an immunogen provides a platform from which to induce such non-RBD responses that may be needed to protect against such an evasion. The second area of interest concerns cryptic pocket targeting antibodies which have proven effective in the neutralization of SARS. These antibodies target an epitope presented only in the 'up' state RBDs and appear to require a two RBD 'up' configuration 33 . The current stabilized ectodomain construct in wide use in SARS-CoV-2 clinical trials was demonstrated previously, and recapitulated here by NSEM, to display only the 'down' and one RBD 'up' states. However, the u1S2q, SD1/S2 targeting design developed here display a prominent two RBD 'up' state distribution compatible with these cryptic-epitope targeting MAbs. This suggests it is capable of inducing such antibodies. While complicating factors, such as a potential for vaccine enhancement, may favor the use of truncated, single domain constructs which may display fewer potentially weakly or non-neutralizing epitopes, these, along with the designs presented here will allow for a detailed characterization of not only vaccine immunogenicity but also antigenicity, paving the way for next generation vaccines for the novel SARS-CoV-2 and the eventual development of a broadly neutralizing \u03b2-CoV vaccine. Thus, while the previous generation of stabilizing mutations ensure well folded trimer, the rational design approach developed here provides a means by which precisely controlling the RBD orientation distribution, thus allowing exploratory efforts to understand the role of conformational dynamics from the perspective of vaccine and drug development.",

This resulted in displacement of the A570L+T572I containing loop from the unmutated position which resides near the S2 L966 residue (Figure 5B and Supplemental Figure S1C). The S2 contact disruption is accompanied by an angular shift of the NTD away from the primary trimer axis owing to SD1 to NTD' contacts, yielding 3 and \u02783 shifts of 5.4\u00b0 and 7.7\u00b0, respectively (Figure 6C). The subdomain rearrangement impacts the positioning of the RBD with only a minor shift in the \u02781 dihedral of 0.1\u00b0 indicating the RBD moved with SD1 indicated in the 1/\u02783 shifts. The newly acquired arrangement in both the RBD and NTD was further accompanied by an apparent increase in their flexibility suggesting conformational heterogeneity. These 'down' state shifts were observed in both the single RBD 'up' structure and the two RBD 'up' structures (Figure 6). Interestingly, the extent to which the SD1 shift differed from that observed in the unmutated construct was context dependent in the 1 RBD 'up' state. While the 'down' state RBD in contact with the up state RBD displayed the large shift in position observed in the all 'down' state, the down state RBD with its terminal position free displayed an intermediate SD1 configuration. The up state RBD in the u1S2q construct resided largely in the position occupied in the unmutated construct. This indicated the effect of the mutations was primarily isolated to the 'down' state and suggested these mutations act to destabilize the 'down' state rather than to stabilize the 'up' state. These features were largely recapitulated in the u1S2q 2 RBD 'up' state conformation with subdomain 1 retaining the shift in the down state RBD (Figure 7). The structural details presented here indicate that, while locking the 'down' state RBD into its unmutated position had little impact on the overall configuration of S1, altering the disposition of SD1 had wide ranging impacts, consistent with the observed strain-to-strain differences in the geometric analysis described in FiguresDiscussionConformational plasticity is a hallmark of enveloped-virus fusion-protein structure, owing to the necessity of protecting the conserved viral fusion elements from host immune responses while retaining a sufficiently steep free-energy gradient to enable host cell fusion 16 . Exposed elements are generally well conditioned to be permissive and responsive to mutations through genetic drift and host immune adaptation. Conformational plasticity, however, presents an important difficulty in the context of vaccine and drug design. Indeed, lessons learned in the continued effort to produce a broadly protective HIV-1 vaccine have demonstrated the importance of a detailed understanding and control of fusion protein dynamics[17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28] . The novel SARS-CoV-2 is likely no exception in this regard and indeed the conformational plasticity of the SARS-2 S-protein appeared greater than that of the HIV-1 Env. We aimed to develop a quantitative understanding of \u03b2-CoV structural states between strains and within each RBD 'down' and 'up' state configuration.

            "text": "From the perspective of immunogen development, the constructs developed here present an opportunity to examine the ability of differentially stabilized S-protein particles to induce two different, yet important antibody responses. First, the disulfide-linked 'down' state locked double mutant (rS2d) would presumably eliminate receptor binding site targeting antibodies which make up the majority of observed responses30,31 . Indeed, a study of MERS responses suggests non-RBD responses (particularly NTD and S2 epitopes) will play an important role in vaccine induced protection 32 . From a theoretical perspective, the wide control over the RBD 'up'/'down' distribution available to the virus suggests that, by analogy to known difficult to neutralize HIV-1 strains, conformational blocking of antibody responses would not be unusual. Although this may result in a fitness cost to the virus, it would not necessarily make the virion non-infectious. Using the double mutant rS2d",
