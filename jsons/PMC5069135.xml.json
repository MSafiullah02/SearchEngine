In microorganisms, antisense therapeutics bind to complementary mRNA and inhibit translation or promote degradation of the targeted mRNA [1]. Although there are many chemical structures that have been designed for antisense technology, we will focus on four structural types that have recently gained the most attention (Figure 1\n): phosphorothioates, locked nucleic acids, peptide nucleic acids, and phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers, plus a few others with structural modifications of these four.",

Further tests in a rhesus monkey model of infection showed that antisense therapy increased survival up to 62%, depending on the dose, and reduced viremia, inflammation and liver damage. More recently, Warren et al. now report that therapeutic treatment with one oligomer alone, targeting the VP24 EBOV protein, protected 75% of rhesus monkeys against a lethal EBOV infection [27\u2022\u2022]. A particularly interesting development is that these antisense oligomers (called PMOplus [28]) did not require a cationic, membrane-penetrating peptide for efficacy. Instead, positive charges are added to the molecular backbone of the molecule. Although the mechanism is unknown by which the positive charges on the backbone enable efficacy, it appears that they enable membrane penetration and provide intracellular access to the replicating virus.",

In recent work, two anti-CHIKV phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (CPMOs) were designed to bind to the two open reading frames of the viral genomic RNA [33]. The authors show that CPMO1 (targeted to ORF1) suppressed viral replication in human cells (HeLa), and significantly lowered viral titers in the tissues using a neonatal mouse model of infection. Importantly, no cytotoxicity was seen in HeLa cells nor was there any PMO-induced toxicity in the neonatal mice.",

The HBcAg, encoded by the C gene, is found in the core of the nucleocapsid and is a precursor to the secretion of HBeAg [39]. Deng et al. synthesized 3 locked nucleic acids targeted to either the HBV S gene, C gene, or the S/C double gene, encapsulated each in liposomes, and treated HBV transgenic mice [40]. The results show that all three treatments decreased HBV DNA replication, but the dual-target S/C LNA showed the greatest reduction. Furthermore, each of the three HBV LNAs reduced the number of HBsAg-positive or HBcAg-positive liver cells as measured by immunohistochemistry. These results, taken with the findings that there was no obvious toxicity, suggest that these LNAs warrant further consideration as therapies against HBV.",

This distinction from the human genome makes the P. falciparum genome a great candidate for targeting by sequence-specific inhibitors. Kolevzon et al. utilized a PNA to alter gene expression in P. falciparum [52\u2022\u2022]. The PNA targeted PfSec13, which is an ortholog of Sec13, a conserved nucleoporin that is essential for viability in P. falciparum [53]. As a means to facilitate solubility and permeability through the cell membranes, the PNA was conjugated to a poly-d-lysine.

Hashimoto et al. utilized phosphorothioate antisense oligos (S-oligos) targeted to T. cruzi inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (TcIP\n3\nR) mRNA [59]. TcIP3R is an essential protein required for the parasitic invasion into host cells [60]. The results show that the antisense oligomer (antisense 5995) decreased the level of the TcIP3R in T. cruzi trypomastigotes. Moreover, this decrease of TcIP3R corresponded with an inhibition of invasion of T. cruzi into 3T3-Swiss albino cells and HeLa cells. Hashimoto et al. has also tested a morpholino oligomer targeted to a splicing site of pre-TcIP3R mRNA [61]. This oligomer (MAO-1) bound to the spliced leader acceptor region and inhibited the maturation of the target mRNA. Exposure of the parasites to the MAO-1 impaired growth in culture and decreased invasion into host cells. The mechanism of action of the MAO-1 was confirmed to be the inhibition of trans-splicing using real-time RT-PCR.",

The usual strategies of screening libraries of compounds or chemically modifying existing antibiotics has produced diminishing returns in recent years, particularly for antibiotics against Gram negative pathogens [64]. An alternative strategy is to design gene-specific oligomers that can specifically target any single pathogen. This approach nearly eliminates or significantly reduces the time required for discovery of a new antimicrobial and broadens the range of potentially available targets to any gene with a known base sequence in any bacterium. Synthetic DNA analogues have been designed and shown to inhibit growth of bacteria since 1981 [65]. Significant improvements have been made along the way, aided by the identification of essential genes and the number of sequenced genomes. But perhaps the most important improvement has been the attachment of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) [66]. Because the cell walls of bacteria are nearly impenetrable by high molecular weight oligomers, delivery of synthetic antisense oligomers into the bacterial cytoplasm requires the attachment of another compound that can penetrate the bacterial cell wall. Most of the recent reports have used antisense oligomers coupled to CPP, often with a sequence of alternating cationic and non-polar amino acids.",

Resistance to standard antibiotics seems to have no effect against antisense oligomers. Some reports have shown significant efficacy in animal models of infection using doses in a clinically relevant range. A few have been tested in non-human primate models, and recently at least one more has reached clinical testing. We think the future is bright for this exciting platform technology that has great potential for addressing the urgent need for new strategies of discovering new antimicrobials.",
