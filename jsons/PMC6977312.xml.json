It was first identified in 1931 during an investigation into an epidemic among sheep on a farm in the Rift Valley of Kenya [1]. The virus infects also humans through inoculation after contact with infected animals or through ingestion of unpasteurized or uncooked by-products of infected animals, or also through inhalation of aerosols produced during the slaughter of infected animals. However, human infections occurred also from the bites of infected mosquitoes, mainly Aedes and Culex but also Anopheles or Mansonia, and other blood-feeding vectors such as flies and ticks have been identified [2\u20134]. To date, no human-to-human transmission of RVFV has been documented.",

The enveloped virion contains a tripartite, predominantly negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome, which codes for structural and non-structural proteins the virus needs to replicate both in mammalian hosts and insect vectors. RVFV attach to cells via the interaction between the viral structural proteins Gn and Gc and C-type lectins, DC-SIGN and I-SIGN [5]. Cells become infected with RVFV by receptor-mediated endocytosis, followed by pH-mediated fusion of virus-endosomal membranes to release nucleocapsids into the cell cytoplasm. Transcription, translation, and genome replication occur in the cytoplasm. The non-structural protein NSs is known to be a major virulence factor allowing the virus to escape host innate immune response. Only one serotype is recognized but strains exist of variable virulence. Moreover, RVFV is classified as a Risk Group 3 agent, and biosafety level (BSL)-3 containment requirements are needed to work with the virus in the laboratory [6].",

            "text": "As other arboviral infections including dengue, chikungunya and zika, RVF is emerging worldwide, due to the globalization of arthropod vectors, mainly mosquitoes, which efficiently transmit an increasing number of old, unrecognized and new viruses. Arboviruses pose a major threat of introduction to several continents, including Europe and North America, with the possibility of co-circulation [7]. The widespread presence of competent vectors, the high viral load in infected animals, trade and global travel, all increase the likelihood of RVFV exportation and establishment outside endemic regions [8\u201310]. Cases have already been imported to Europe and Asia [9, 11, 12] and concerns have raised about its potential to extend to other parts of Asia, Europe [13] and United States [14, 15]. Such an introduction would cause significant losses to the livestock industry and substantial human morbidity and mortality [16]. Clinicians need to consider RVF in the differential diagnosis for febrile illnesses in a suitable context, however manifestations of RVFV in humans are varied and unspecific including hepatitis, encephalitis, hemorrhagic disease, and retinitis with potential dramatic consequences. The overall case fatality rate is estimated from 0.5 to 2% [8, 17], but higher mortality rates were recorded, as for example 18% by the Saudi Health Ministry in 2000 [18], around 22% in East Africa, West Africa, South Africa and Madagascar from 2006 to 2010 [16], and 28% in Tanzania in 2007 [19].",

Strategies of RVFV control appeared us challenging because of its complex biological cycle and its multiple routes of transmission to humans [21]. Besides, the wide clinical spectrum over a long-period of time made very difficult the establishment of standard definitions of human cases and recommendations for their management. We conducted a literature review on the RVF clinical disease and treatments in humans. We identified the state and frontiers of knowledge. Lacking guidelines on the RVF human disease, we proposed an algorithm to assist physicians on the field in the evaluation of cases. This algorithm could help and be improved during next epidemics.",

The typical presentation includes headache, fever, backache and generalized aches in muscles and joints, lasting 4 to 7 days [4, 17, 35, 36]. Malaise, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, flushed face, and conjunctival suffusion were also reported [17, 37]. RVF differs from influenza, dengue and chikungunya as to whether cough, skin involvement (i.e. rash or pruritus) and arthritis are respectively uncommon signs. A slight meningism at the acute stage is not rare, however its prognosis value has never been evaluated [37]. Basically, retro-orbital pains and neck stiffness are features hard to classify because both of them were commonly reported in uncomplicated RVF cases [36], but were also associated with the occurrence of complications [37, 38].",

No standard definition of suspected cases exists. Rates of complications measured in studies depend on the definitions and methods of recruitment. Indeed, the use of clinical or biological criteria specific to RVF complications to define suspected cases could lead to underestimate the mild forms [40\u201342]. Globally, since the first description of the spectrum of RVF in humans by Laughlin et al. during the major outbreak in Egypt in 1977, it is considered that less than 5% of symptomatic cases will present complications including ocular, neurologic and hemorrhagic symptoms, while favorable outcome will occur within 1 week for the others [17]. In this historical series, the different known complications occurred in equal proportions (30\u201335%), but hepatic or renal failures were not identified. During the 2007 Kenyan outbreak, Kahlon et al. described a clinical syndrome suggestive of severe RVF, characterized by fever, large-joint arthralgia, and gastrointestinal complaints, later followed by jaundice, right upper-quadrant pain, and delirium, often coinciding with hemorrhagic manifestations [43]. Complicated forms could have represented up to 20% of symptomatic cases during recent epidemics [36].",

In Saudi Arabia in 2000, hepatic insufficiency (75%) and renal failures (41%) were the most frequent complications [47]. Moreover, during the epidemic in Madagascar, highly fatal associations of two or more complications were highlighted. These occurred in 11/16 (69%) severe cases, of whom 5 (45%) had encephalitis with hemorrhagic symptoms which were lethal in 2/5 (40%), representing half of the deaths (4/16) [46]. Variations in the RVFV tropism and virulence are hypothesized according to the lineage involved and the possible accumulation of genetic mutations or genomic reassortments [17, 48\u201350], despite a low overall genomic diversity (\u223c 5%) at the nucleotide level [51].

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, MyD88, TRIF, MAVS, and RIG-I) were also associated with severe symptomatology [55]. Acute malaria co-occurrence was observed in severe forms and HIV-positive status was associated with a 75% case fatality rate in Tanzania in 2007 [19].

Yellow fever-like expression were also reported with a first improvement at day 3 followed by a rebound of fever [62]. Epistaxis is not considered a reliable sign of how serious the illness is [64, 65]. Thrombocytopenia is invariably present. Hepato-renal failure with jaundice, disseminated intravascular coagulation and encephalitis can be associated [44, 66]. Overall prevalence is estimated 1%, but prevalence was rather 10% in hospital cohorts [40, 47]. A population-based survey during the 2007 outbreak in Kenya even reported 26% of hemorrhagic RVF disease with a mortality of 23% in this group of cases [67]. Indeed, the mortality rate associated with bleeding manifestations is the highest, up to 65% [40, 68]. Viral load could play an important role in the hemorrhagic expression. In humans studies, it exhibited positive correlation with markers of inflammation (IP-10, CRP, Eotaxin, MCP-2 and Granzyme B), markers of fibrinolysis (tPA and D-dimer), and markers of endothelial function (sICAM-1), but a negative correlation with P-selectin, ADAMTS13, and fibrinogen, which are associated with coagulation pathways occurring on the endothelial surface [69].",

In a human outbreak in Mauritania in 1989, up to 5% of observed infections had encephalitis [71]. Two types of pure encephalitis were described: acute febrile forms with short duration and possibility of death, and subacute forms with a longer duration, a lower fatality rate but frequent sequelae [71]. Pulmonary complications may occur [71, 74], and malaria can worsen the severity of neurologic symptoms [19]. Lethality may be as high as 50% in this form [40].",

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed high signal intensity on T2-weighted images in frontoparietal and thalamic regions, with multiple bilateral asymmetrical cortical hyperintense areas consistent with inflammation or ischemia in axial diffusion, while changes in CT-scan of her brain appeared much later [70]. In delayed meningoencephalitis normal glucose and protein concentrations will lymphocytic pleocytosis were found in CSF [17]. In a kidney transplant recipient with cured hepatitis B, presenting acute hepatitis followed by delayed pachymeningitis, specific RVF-IgM were detected in lymphocytic CSF at day 58, while IgG were positive in blood at the first screening at day 44 [74], which was consistent with the first neurologic description in literature [72].",

Active viral replication in brain leading to necrotizing encephalitis was documented in several animal models [75, 76]. The route of transmission and prompt robust immune response could be a determining factor of the RVF neurologic disease course [77]. Indeed, whatever the routes of inoculation, RVFV RNA was detected in the brain of infected rats confirming the virus neurotropism [78], but aerosol exposure to RVFV caused earlier and more severe neuropathology in the murine model and fatal encephalitis in primates [75, 76]. In aerosol-infected rats with lethal encephalitis, neutrophils and macrophages were the major cell types infiltrating the CNS, and this was concomitant with microglia activation and extensive cytokine inflammation [78]. Differences in the peripheral blood biomarkers during the course of the neurological disease in African green monkeys were measured with defect in early T-cells, proinflammatory and antiviral responses in lethal encephalitis [79]. Other immune disorders and alteration in vascular permeability in the brain could be more involved in delayed forms [80].",

The prevalence of ocular manifestations has been estimated to 1% during epidemic outbreaks in Egypt in 1977, and up to 15% both in patients with mild and severe RVF disease during the 2000 outbreak in southwest Saudi Arabia [84]. Unilateral or bilateral symptoms generally occur 5 to 14 days after the RVFV infection, but can be more delayed, and may include decreased visual acuity, scotoma, acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis and retro-orbital pain [85]. The most frequent and most specific ocular lesion is a macular or paramacular retinitis [86, 87]. The funduscopy by indirect ophthalmoscopy usually shows a single well demarcated necrotic lesion with ill-defined creamy-white patchy lesions of macular retinitis with hemorrhages [84]. The other retinal signs include arterial occlusions, vasculitis (mostly phlebitis and sometimes arteritis) [84], sheathing of the vessels, which are best explored using fluorescein angiography. In series, vitreous reaction with vitreal haze or vitritis occurred in less than one third of patients, optic-nerve head edema or palor were described in 15% of cases with retinal involvement, and no infectious optic neuropathy was reported [84, 85]. Anterior uveitis was associated with a posterior uveitis, defining a panuveitis with aqueous flare and fine non-granulomatous keratic precipitates [84, 85]. Fluorescein angiography performed during the active phase of the disease may show early hypofluorescence with delayed filling of the arterioles and venules, associated with late staining of the lesions [84]. It also helps for the diagnosis of vasculitis, showing vessels sheathing and staining, and vascular occlusions when present. Follow-up fluorescein angiography performed several months after RVF diagnosis have revealed window defect in the area of the retinitis, vascular occlusions and obliterated macular vessels [84]. However, ophthalmoscopic and angiographic features of the RVFV associated retinitis are not specific and can be encountered in several viral or bacterial infections (Table 3) [85, 87\u201389].\n",

No chronic anterior uveitis, posterior synechiae, iris nodules, uveitic glaucoma nor cataract were described [38, 84, 85]. It is not known if the ocular manifestations of the RVF result from direct toxicity of the virus or from an immune response to the infection. Post-mortem examination suggested the presence of focal areas of retinal necrosis and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) degeneration with round cell inflammatory infiltration and perivascular cuffing but the presence of the virus in the ocular tissues has not been proved. Most of animal models for RVF do not show any ocular disease [35, 57]. In a sheep model quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was positive on eye tissues after the viremic phase [90], but retinal complications of RVF could also be caused by antibody-related auto-immune reactions [86].",

However a recent cross sectional study has demonstrated an association between infection with RVFV and miscarriage in Sudanese pregnant women (54% versus 12% of risk in non-infected pregnant women with p < 0.0001 and OR 7.4 with 95% CI [2.7\u201320.1] in multiple logistic regression analysis) [93]. The teratogenic potential of the RVFV is unknown. Occasional vertical transmission has been reported, sometimes with fatal outcome in the newborn [94, 95]. Few symptomatic infections were described in pregnant women [91] and children under the age of 10 years old [96, 97]. The question is remaining whether it is the result of a lack of exposure to infected mosquitoes and infected animals, or if there are differences in susceptibility between animals and humans [8].",

Considering RVF is also mosquito-borne disease [56], we recommend for all-day preventive measures against vectors using physical (long clothing and bed nets), chemical (topical repellents and insecticide impregnations) barriers in the environment of viremic patients. Considering the mean length of the viremia, these measures could be reasonably stopped 1 week after the illness onset, but there is no evidence-based cut-off time to allow donation of blood and removal of tissue or organs for transplantation from a RVFV-infected patient.",

Viral isolation is also an assay for laboratory confirmation of RVFV infection but this assay needs to be done on BSL3 and is less sensitive than detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR. Interestingly, RT-PCR for RVFV was reported positive for a prolonged period in urines, semen [74] and whole blood [9]. The RVFV RNA load in blood usually decreases between days 1 to 4 and may be detectable until day 8 after the onset of symptoms [9]. Prolonged and intense viremias were reported during acute encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever. Thus, testing of serial patient specimens collected 24 to 48 h apart may have prognostic value in determining patient outcome. The decrease in viral loads coincides with a rise in RVFV specific IgM and IgG antibodies that may be testing using ELISA. The presence of IgM antibodies appears as an early transient response (day 4 to 60) and protective IgG antibodies persist for several years [36]. A second convalescent blood sample collected 7\u201314 days after the first is necessary to confirm the seroconversion making a definitive diagnosis of a recent RVF infection.",

Evidence suggests ribavirin efficacy in animal models [102, 103], but it failed to prevent from neuropathology in mice infected by RVFV by aerosol exposure [75]. Ribavirin is recommended for the treatment and the prophylaxis of hemorrhagic fever due to arenaviruses and bunyaviruses [104] and was successfully used to cure and prevent from Lassa fever [105]. To date, its use is not indicated when RVF diagnosis is confirmed [39, 56].

Early renal substitution therapy in patients with severe acute renal failure improve the prognosis and survival [39, 56, 81]. For eye involvement, artificial tear preparations may maintain corneal lubrication and provide temporary comfort for ocular irritation. Topical ophthalmic steroids were used in the RVFV anterior segment manifestations [84]. Aciclovir was used in eyes lesions of other mosquito-transmitted viral disease notably chikungunya, dengue and West Nile (Table 2) [112]. Other antiviral drugs (e.g. ganciclovir, foscarnet) could be administrated through intravitreal routes. In case of elevated intraocular pressure, antiglaucoma medications could be useful. Ocular surgery including cataract removal, retinal hole and detachment repair, vitrectomy, and laser ablation for neovascularization could be additional therapeutics to be evaluated.",

[64], the CDC definitions of suspected severe RVF cases during the major epidemic in Saudi Arabia in 2000 [42], the updated guidelines for health workers [39], and clinical series in literature [19, 40, 43, 45, 47, 61, 63], we propose an algorithm to help clinicians at the bedside in the classification and referral of patients during a RVF outbreak (Fig. 4). Using the dengue model for case management, we identified clinical and biological warning signs defining complicated cases at risk of severe illness and requiring hospitalization for medical supervision, as we already proposed for chikungunya [113]. Severe illness included hemorrhagic fever, neurological disorders or hepatic/renal failures requiring intensive cares. Ocular signs were classified as complications. Ophthalmologic examination should be prospectively performed in all confirmed cases to detect early asymptomatic RVFV ocular signs and evaluate their potential ability to predict the occurrence of neuro-ophthalmologic complications. This should at least include visual acuity determination, intra-ocular pressure measurement, slit-lamp biomicroscopy and funduscopy by indirect ophthalmoscopy. In case of RVF signs, a fluorescein angiography should be performed as well as fundus photography if available. Indocyanine Green angiography has not been evaluated yet in FVR ocular manifestation but could possibly bring arguments for a choroidal involvement since a delayed peripapillary choroidal filling in the arteriovenous phase of fluorescein angiography has been described [38, 85]. Optic Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a recent technique that is yet to be evaluated in the retinal complications of RVF. OCT could be helpful to describe the retinal lesions and their evolution through time, and could help elucidate the nature of the macular exudate-like lesions described before [114]. We recommend to follow-up RVF patients for at least 1 month after the onset of symptoms to monitor for possible delayed neurological and/or ocular complications. In the lack of adequate medical support, considering the diversity and time course of RVF complications, medical evacuation of confirmed cases may be considered, except if hemorrhages because this presentation is a highly contagious vital emergency.\n",

There is a global concern about the risk of RVFV exportation in areas where competent vectors are present including Europe and North America. Economic losses, human morbidity and mortality may be significant during epidemics. Infection with RVF has a wide clinical spectrum and may result in delayed complications. There are no commercially licensed vaccines nor antiviral treatment for humans. Human cases are often detected when the virus has already spread among livestock and people, hence outbreak control is challenging. Thus, human case surveillance systems for early detection and correct management are essential to reduce global morbidity and mortality. We proposed a tool for physician guidance on the field. This algorithm should be evaluated during ongoing and coming outbreaks, and could help neighboring places in the detection of cases. We identified frontiers of knowledge and remaining uncertainties concerning RVF which deserves more interest. In particular, therapeutic trials on specific supportive care, antiviral molecules or immunotherapies, should be anticipated to be implemented at the start of future epidemics.",
