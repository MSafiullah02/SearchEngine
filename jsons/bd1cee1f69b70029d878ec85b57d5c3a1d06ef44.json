Brown et al 1 and Babazade et al 4 describe the use of plastic drapes, whereas Lai and Chang 2 and Tsai 3 describe rigid box designs. [1] [2] [3] [4] Although these designs are innovative, they do suffer from some important drawbacks. Rigid box designs significantly limit forearm and hand movements and might require some practice to achieve competence in use. 2, 3 In addition, the rigid design forces assistants to stand far off to the side of the patient, which limits help with airway management and does not offer them the same protection provided to the laryngoscopist. These designs can require initial elaborate construction, such as Tsai's 3 design. Lai and Chang's 2 design, although less elaborate in construction, lacks transparency of other models, possibly making its use even more challenging. 2 Reusable designs of Tsai 3 might also have the added issue of having to be decontaminated, which might be a problem in nonmedical grade devices. 3 Plastic drape cover designs of Brown et al 1 and Babazade et al 4 have the advantage of being inexpensive, commonly available, quick to produce, and disposable. 1, 4 They also have multiple access points for assistance; however, the weight of the plastic drape on proceduralist's hands still might be an issue when performing procedures under the device. The plastic drape is also quite close to the patient's face and this might not be tolerated by some patients.",

When utilizing the hood, visible Glo-Germ spread was confined to the clinician's hands, forearms, intubating manikin's head, neck, and the operating table covered by the hood. Without the hood, Glo-Germ could be identified on the laryngoscopist's hands, entire arms, gown, neck, face, eye protection, mask, and more extended spread around the operating room. As standard masks were used, we also noticed an interesting qualitative difference when the hood was used. Fine droplet Glo-Germ produce a distinctive smell when aerosolized, and this was noticed by the laryngoscopist only when the hood was not used.",

Such data will allow more confident approaches to techniques meant at providing protection during airway management.",
