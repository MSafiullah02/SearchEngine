Although some scholars discussed the effect of firm size on philanthropic giving from the point of view of institutional pressure, it is still hard to conclude that firms take philanthropic giving as a response to institutional pressure because large firms also have more resources and capability to do so just than smaller firms (a resource-based or slack-resource view). Therefore, to support (or defy) institutional viewpoint of corporate philanthropy, more evidences are needed. Besides, in spite of theoretical pervasiveness, empirical research on corporate donation activities needs developing (Bandeira-de-Mello et al., 2008), especially the empirical research in developing countries.",

Since the implementation of a reform and openness policy in China in 1978, economy oriented policy leads to the ignorance of CSR. CSR came into China only in the mid-1990s on a tidal wave of social responsibility audits which were launched by numerous multinational organizations involved in mainly consumer goods and the retail sector (Zhou, 2006). Its expansion and development have to a great extent been in reaction to export requirements, and initially a wait-and-see strategy was adopted by the Chinese government (Tian, 2006).",

This pressure (to move from a passive approach to a much more proactive one) comes from the Chinese government who is altering its attitude and the degree of attention paid to CSR (Tian, 2006).",

Confucians believe that the nature of human beings is to achieve happiness and to do good. As a result, Confucianism advocates people to be benevolent, philanthropic and humane. Corporate philanthropy is observable everywhere in modern China. The 1998 flood disaster, the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) accident, the 2004 Tsunami of India Ocean, the 2008 frost disaster and the May 12, 2008 Great Wenchuan Earthquake, witness disaster relief donations from individuals and companies. Besides, more and more companies contribute their donations to helping the poor and the disable, supporting education, sanitation, sports and arts, and the like. But unfortunately, no precise data is reported by the government to show how much the corporate donation is.",

Therefore, in this study we select the listed companies collected by the two leading websites in China \u2014 the Baidu.com (http://finance.baidu.com/hongguan/guonei/2008-05-19/100237.html) and the Sina.com (http://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/blank/wcjiuzai.shtml) \u2014 as the sample. These two websites collect the contributions of thousands of companies. However, among the companies, there are only 295 listed in Chinese domestic stock markets. Besides, since the earthquake took place in May 2008, companies who got listed after May 2008 are not suitable for this study. Finally, some companies made their donation in mixture of the company, the employees and their control shareholder. Therefore, if we cannot distinguish the companies' donation from their employees or control shareholders, we deleted those companies from our sample. By doing so, we finally got a sample consisting of 254 listed companies.",

The possible reasons may be that most non-service companies in our sample produce consumer goods rather than industrial goods. As a result, they may perceive higher pressure from consumers than service companies who sell the products. After all, consumers care more about the manufacturers rather than the sellers. Therefore, it suggests that further research should divide non service companies into two categories: those who produce consumer goods and those who produce industrial goods.",

We demonstrate the usefulness of institutional theory in explaining the corporate philanthropic behaviors. This is different from the mainstream point of view about corporate philanthropy which argues that firms conduct philanthropy based merely on rational economic considerations. Besides, although Oliver (1991) argues that firms may engage in \u201cwindow dressing\u201d and other symbolic behaviors to avoid sharing social responsibility genuinely, our research finds that they are less likely to avoid their social responsibility under high institutional pressure. Finally, though many scholars identified the potential value of political ties (or even guanxi with other stakeholders) in China, our research demonstrates that the effect of guanxi is dual. Good guanxi with the government also increases a firm's vulnerability to support the government's needs and expectations.",
