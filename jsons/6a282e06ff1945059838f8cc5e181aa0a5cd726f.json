For COWP, the genomic DNA was amplified in 25.0% (6/24) of the isolates; 14.3% were from \"Ribatejo e Oeste\" and 40.0% from \"Alentejo\".

At allow meaningful statistical analysis on geographical differences. \"Alentejo\", 456 samples were obtained and at \"Ribatejo e Oeste\" the number of samples was 97. Twelve age groups were defined: Group 1 (1-7 days old), group 2 (8-15), group 3 (16-24). group 4 (25-32), group After ER-RFLP of the 24 isolates, found ( Genotyping of C. parvurn isolates -Genomic DNA was extracted from 186 samples (128 positives and 58 negatives) and purified by two methds: guanidinium thiocyanate/silica and proteinase w e a t followed by ethanol precipitation. Two pairs of primers were used in the PCR [3, 4] . In conclusion, the prevalence of bovine cryptosporidiosis was high at tbc two studied regions. The only genotype found was the bovine type, which is common to animals and man, suggesting that C. parvum transmission is not necessarily a zoonosis. although zoonotic &ansmission can also occurs. Bovine play an important role as nservoirS for human cryptosporidiosis and also as a source of mvirmental contamination. Although viability studies with DAPI were not conclusive. oocysts were observed in water used for calves. 'his fact can contribute for the spread of animal cryptosporidiosis, environmental contamination and public health risks. Due to the small number of oocysts found in the water samples, determination of the irolates'genotype was not possible. Cryptosporidiosis study at Portugal needs to be pursuit by genotyping more isolates from faecal, animal drinking water and farm effluent samples using other molecular markers. ",
