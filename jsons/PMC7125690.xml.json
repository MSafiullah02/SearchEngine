Thus, the ANP approach is utilized to solve the evaluation and selection problem. Additionally, this study uses a numerical example to illustrate the steps in the proposed method. Base on results, we conclude that the weights of have a central role when selecting a resort type. The ANP is the generic form of the AHP, and allows for complex interdependent relationships among elements (Saaty, 2001). The proposed develop analytic network process (ANP) evaluation structure approach generates more informative and accurate results than the conventional ANP for resort type analysis. The ANP-based decision-making approach provides expert decision-makers with a valuable reference for selecting the location for an international resort park type in Taiwan.",

For example, studies attempted to identify the optimal locations for international resort parks by via conventional mathematical or statistical models. In addition to legislative restrictions, policymakers and business groups seldom consider how to select an optimal location during the decision-making process; this shortcoming can often affect the competitiveness of a tourism advantageous position. Based on the resort development model utilized in Bali, the Taiwanese Tourism Bureau will handled site selection, feasibility assessments, and initial planning of resort areas (Tourism Bureau MOTC, 2004, Tourism Bureau MOTC, 2005). These factors reflect the need for tourism planning to ensure that market demand is met.",

According to Porter, the four determinants of a nation shape the environment in which local firms compete and promote or impede the creation of competitive conditions (Porter, 1990). The four determinants and the two forces are as follows:1.\nFactor conditions: These are factors of production, such as labor resources, nature resources, capital, and infrastructure.2.\nDemand conditions: Demand conditions emphasize the nature of consumer demand in a home country in motivating a firm to increase its competitive position. In this study, marketing division, marketing scope, and local resident attitudes are the primary factors considered under demand conditions.3.\nFirm strategy, structure and rivalries: The conditions govern how companies are created, organized, managed, and determine the nature of domestic rivalry (Tayeb, 1996). It includes business strategies and structures, policymaker attitudes, vision and corporate social responsibility in a relevant industry.4.\nRelated and supporting industries: The presence or absence in a nation of supplier industries and related industries that are globally competitive (Tayeb, 1996). Examples of are local natural resources, local human resources, and a medical center and police station for emergencies that support products and a materials management control system and unit.5.\nGovernment: Government policy has a marked influence on the success of an industry. It includes legal restrictions, government policies and the political environment.6.\nChance: Certain events such as disasters, technological developments, Popular media, changing market demand, and set up bilingual. Chance creates discontinuities that affect competition.\n",

Generally, different tasks are fulfilled by different systems. ANP of measurement concerned with deriving the dominance priorities from paired comparisons of homogeneous elements with respect to a common criterion or attribute (Saaty, 1980, Saaty, 1994). The ANP, which was first developed by Saaty (1980) helps establish decision models for a process containing both qualitative and quantitative components. Qualitatively, ANP decomposes a decision problem from the top overall goal to a set of manageable clusters and sub-clusters, down to the bottom level, which typically contains scenarios or alternatives. The clusters and sub-clusters can be forces, attributes, criteria, activities, or objectives. Quantitatively, ANP uses pair-wise comparisons to assign weights to elements at the cluster and sub-cluster levels, and finally calculates \u201cglobal\u201d weights for assessments at the bottom level. Each pair-wise comparison measures the relative importance or strength of elements within a cluster level using a ratio scale. One of the primary functions of the AHP is to calculate a consistency ratio to determine whether the matrices are appropriate for analysis (Saaty, 1980). However, AHP models assume that uni-directional relationships exist between elements at different decision levels in a hierarchy and uncorrelated elements within each cluster, as well as between clusters. Models that specify interdependent relationships in the AHP are inappropriate. The ANP is then developed to fill this overcome this shortcoming.",

Decision-makers are asked to respond to a series of pair-wise comparisons in which two elements or two components are compared base don how they contribute to their particular upper level criterion (Meade & Sarkis, 1999). Additionally, when interdependencies exist among elements in a component, pair-wise comparisons must also be performed, and an eigenvector can be derived for each element that indicates the affects of other elements on that element. The relative importance values are determined on a scale of 1\u20139, where a score of 1 represents equal importance between two elements and a score of 9 indicates extreme importance of one element (row component in the matrix) compared to another element (column component in the matrix) (Meade & Sarkis, 1999). A reciprocal value is assigned to the inverse comparison; that is, a\nij\n = 1/a\nji; where (a\nij) is the importance of the ith (jth) element compared to the jth (ith) element. Like the AHP, pair-wise comparisons in the ANP are in the framework of a matrix, and a local priority vector can be derived as an estimate of relative importance associated with elements (or components) being compared by solving the following formula:(1)A\u00b7w=\u03bbmax\u00b7w,where A is the matrix of a pair-wise comparison, w is the eigenvector, and \u03bb\nmax is the largest eigenvalue of A. Saaty (1980) developed several algorithms for approximating w. In this study, the following three-step procedure is utilized to synthesize priorities (Meade & Presley, 2002).(a)Sum the values in each column in the pair-wise comparison matrix.(b)Divide each element in a column by the sum of its respective column. The resulting matrix is then called the normalized pair-wise comparison matrix.(c)Sum the elements in each row of the normalized pair-wise comparison matrix, and divide the sum by the n elements in the row. These final values provide an estimate of relative priorities for compared elements with respect to the upper level criterion. Priority vectors must be derived for all comparison matrices.\n",

Tourism is also adversely affected by wars. Examples of detrimental events are the political coup in Fiji in 2000, the terrorist attack in the United States on September 11, 2001, the Bali attack in 2002, and the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in Asia in 2003.2.\nTechnology (SC\n19\n): Advances in technology have contributed to a favorable tourism experience and affected the way resorts market to business and leisure travelers.3.\nPopular media (SC\n20\n): Television (TV) is one of the most popular and influential vehicles for attracting the attention diverse populations. Among the various studies that have mentioned the power of TV affecting contemporary social life, some have focused on the impacts TV programs have on location from a tourism-marketing standpoint. These studies indicate that movies can be a beneficial vehicle for vicarious satisfaction for tourists, a satisfaction that does not require tourist to incur the costs related to travel, time, and health. The effects of films on tourist flow in tourism literature have been widely discussed in terms of economic impacts, intangible benefits, negative impacts, and symbolic meaning and value.4.\nRadically changing market demand (SC\n21\n): An increasing population in a region often decreases tourism, e.g., SARS, subsequently created a dramatic reduction in demand for the local tourism markets.5.\nSet up bilingual (SC\n22\n): To eliminate language barriers, domestic resort parks can utilize bilingual placards and pamphlets. Set up bilingual is based on written or visual materials, including booklets, newspapers, magazines, brochures, advertisements, films, official documents, video tapes, photographs and web pages, that can provide rich information about tourism destinations in two languages.\n",

A supermatrix is a partitioned matrix, in which each sub-matrix is composed of vectors obtained from pair-wise comparisons. As discussed in the Appendix and dotted parentheses in Fig. 3, the supermatrix in this study covers all network elements. Fig. 6\nshows the generalized form of the supermatrix. The supermatrix, inserted with respective vectors and matrices obtained prior to before in Table 6\n. Because the supermatrix includes interactions between clusters, (e.g. an inter dependence exists among criteria and among sub-criteria), not all columns sums to 1. A weighted supermatrix is transformed first to be stochastic (Table 7\n). After entering normalized values into the supermatrix and completing the column stochastic, the supermatrix is then raised to a sufficiently large power until convergence occurs. The current super-matrix reached convergence and attained a unique eigenvector. Table 8\npresents the final limit matrix. This limit matrix is column stochastic and represents the final eigenvector. Synthesis, with respect to selection of resort type, obtained the following results, seaside resorts (0.165), lakeside resorts (0.128), casino resorts (0.141) and health/spa resorts (0.111) (Table 8). Thus, the optimal resort type is seaside resorts.",

Analytical results suggest that the relative weights changed considerably as the interdependent relationships have a considerable effect on the process model. Finally, by applying the ANP to obtain criteria weight and ranking those results, the seaside resort is the preferred resort type. For the international resort park considered in this case study the four resort types considered are utilized to construct the evaluation model. Analytical results correspond to those for the international resort park. The proposed evaluation method selects resort type for a new international resort park under construction, ensuring that it has competitive advantage once established. This study developed an evaluation criterion for selecting seaside resorts for a new international resort park to be established in Taiwan. Additionally, the proposed evaluation criterion provides policy makers and academics with recommendations for future development.",
