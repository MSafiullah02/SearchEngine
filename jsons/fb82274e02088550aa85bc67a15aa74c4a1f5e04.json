Individual puppies were assigned to treatment A or B as they arrived. This ensured that puppies arriving from one breeder were in equal numbers in each treatment group. The dogs were fed individually. Individual fecal scores were recorded daily using the WALTHAM fecal scoring system (18) . The mean daily fecal score was calculated for each group. Data were analyzed via ANOVA with an interaction between treatment and time using the statistical packages S-PLUS (6.1) and GENSTAT (&.1). P , 0.05 was considered to be significant.",
