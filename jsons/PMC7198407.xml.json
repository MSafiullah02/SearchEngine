The reported COVID-19 global death toll has now risen to more than 200,000 since its first death in early January, far surpassing the combined reported death toll of SARS and MERS, which stands at less than 2,000 [2], [3]. Moreover, a considerable number of deaths from COVID-19 are taking place in the community and in care homes, which are commonly not being included in publicised national death tolls. The reported number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the People\u2019s Republic of China has largely been exceeded by those residing elsewhere, with the USA and Europe now the new epicentres of this global health pandemic.",

Disease severity can range from an illness with only mild respiratory symptoms to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Incubation time is also variable, with symptoms taking from two days to as long as around two weeks to appear [7]. COVID-19 presents most frequently as a pneumonia, with its associated signs and symptoms, including fever, dry cough, and breathlessness, with characteristic radiological changes of bilateral lung opacities [6]. Whilst many of these also feature in SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has a propensity to cause lower respiratory tract infections, as suggested by the relatively less frequent occurrence of symptoms such as rhinorrhoea and sore throat. SARS and MERS are also more commonly linked to gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea. Furthermore, it has become increasingly clear that all of these highly pathogenic coronaviruses affect the cardiovascular system, with evidence of both acute and chronic cardiovascular features [8].",

A retrospective study in China involving more than 200 participants revealed that a subset of COVID-19 patients experienced neurological symptoms [9]. These included impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease and skeletal muscle symptoms, suggesting the involvement of both the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). The observed symptoms were more likely to be present in patients suffering from severe disease. Other possible PNS symptoms included hypogeusia and hyposmia. The link between these neurological symptoms and patient outcome could not be investigated, as patients were still acutely hospitalised at the time of the publication. Another study by the same group reported that in 13 patients COVID-19 infection was followed by acute cerebrovascular disease, including ischaemic stroke, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and cerebral haemorrhage [10]. These features were again more common in severe disease and older patients.",

The neurological features included evidence of encephalopathy, corticospinal tract dysfunction, agitation and delirium. MRI and perfusion brain imaging conducted in a small subset of patients also revealed leptomeningeal enhancement and bilateral frontotemporal hypoperfusion, and two patients also had evidence of a small acute ischaemic stroke.

Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 attaches to the host cell membrane through interaction between a spike protein and the host ACE2 receptor [32], [33]. Notably, the binding affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to ACE2 has been found to be significantly higher than that of the SARS-CoV spike protein [32], although the implications of this remain to be established. Whilst still controversial, ACE inhibitors and ibuprofen may increase ACE2 levels [34], potentially facilitating COVID-19 infection, and are of interest because of their use in the management of migraine.",

            "text": "It is also currently unclear how SARS-CoV-2 invades the human CNS. One suggested mechanism is through haematogenous dissemination, whereby the virus crosses into the CNS from the bloodstream by infecting endothelial cells or leukocytes [35]. Another possible pathway is via retrograde neuronal routes, in which the virus gains access to the CNS by infecting peripheral neurons [35]. Animal studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV could reach the brain via an olfactory route, promoting neurodegeneration [33]. Emerging evidence from two studies, both available via bioRxiv preprint, and therefore yet to be peer-reviewed, suggests that SARS-CoV-2 also gains access to the CNS via the olfactory pathway, with concordant results demonstrating the expression of both the ACE2 receptor and the spike protein protease TMPRSS2, which is also required for SARS-CoV-2 entry, by specific subsets of cells present in the olfactory region [36], [37]. Whilst reports of SARS-related olfactory neuropathy are sparse [38], anosmia and hyposmia are increasingly being recognised as key features of COVID-19 infection, often as a presenting symptom [9], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]. Thus, these studies could potentially provide promising avenues for future research aimed at improving our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism.",

The COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated the rapid dissemination of authoritative and practical information by representative neurology bodies globally, providing, for instance, consensus guidance advising about isolation strategies for high-risk patients, and the management considerations for patients on immunosuppressive agents. The scope of these guidelines will change based on emerging data from our colleagues in other specialties, such as whether thromboprophylaxis regimes, or the process of taking informed consent need to be altered in patients requiring intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, given the concerns about prothrombotic states in COVID-19. Moreover, given the possibility that a significant driver of pathology may be related to an overactive immune state, it remains an open question whether certain immunosuppressive agents may be beneficial, such as has been suggested in a case report of ocrelizumab in multiple sclerosis [51]. Owing to outpatient departments being closed to mitigate COVID-19 transmission, several academic centres, hospitals and clinics have rapidly adopted new strategies for managing neurology patients, and it is heartening to see those neurological centres lacking in infrastructure for tele-medicine catching up with those that did, in a concerted effort to maintain acute neurology and outpatient services.",

            "text": "The neurology of COVID-19 and other coronavirus-related infections is a rapidly evolving area of medicine. Whilst most studies in the past, including those relating to SARS and MERS, have mainly involved small patient samples, the latest evidence on COVID-19 suggests that neurological events may occur in a significant proportion of patients. Further studies will allow for an assessment of the presence of any long-term neurological sequelae. There is a need for record-linkage studies that can establish varying degrees of associations between the incidence, severity and prognosis of COVID-19, and specific immunosuppressive disease modifying therapies, that would help in risk stratification and risk modification exercises for the management of patients with neuroinflammatory disorders; this would be especially useful if there were a second wave of COVID-19 illness. Finally, improving our understanding of the neurobiology of coronaviruses could augment our knowledge of neurological disorders with potential viral associations, such as viral encephalitis and multiple sclerosis.",
