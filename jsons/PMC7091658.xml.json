This highly conserved ubiquitously expressed class of enzymes is responsible for correct coupling of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs,1\u20133 which base pair with messenger RNA (mRNA) triplets.4 This ensures incorporation of correct amino acids in the growing polypeptide chain during protein synthesis. Each proteinogenic amino acid is coupled to its corresponding tRNA by a specific ARS,1 as reflected in the ARS nomenclature (for example IARS for isoleucine-tRNA synthetase; LARS for leucine-tRNA synthetase). Because protein translation takes place in both the cytosol and mitochondria, mammalian cells possess cytosolic and mitochondrial ARSs. Mitochondrial ARSs are encoded by separate nuclear genes (nomenclature: ARS2), with the exception of KARS, GARS, and QARS, which encode both the cytosolic and mitochondrial ARSs.1",

In the first description, a heterozygous missense pathogenic variation in GARS was found to cause Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease type 2D, a peripheral axonal neuropathy.5 Subsequently, other dominant pathogenic variations in GARS,6\u201316\nYARS,17,18\nAARS,19\u201324\nHARS,25\nKARS,26 and MARS27 have been associated with peripheral axonal neuropathies. In the past 10 years, pathogenic variations in mitochondrial ARSs (DARS2, RARS2, EARS2, MARS2, FARS2, YARS2, SARS2, AARS2, and HARS2)28 have emerged as a cause of human disease. The clinical presentation of these mitochondrial diseases was reported to depend on the affected ARS, with encephalopathy as the most common manifestation. Only in the past 5 years have homozygous and compound heterozygous pathogenic variations been identified in cytosolic LARS,29,30\nAARS,31,32\nMARS,33\u201335\nIARS,36,37\nYARS,38\nVARS,39\nRARS,40\nDARS,41\nHARS,42\nSARS,43 and in the combined cytosolic and mitochondrial QARS,44\u201347\nGARS,48\u201350 and KARS26,51\u201354 genes. The resulting autosomal recessive diseases show considerable clinical variability and involve numerous organs without apparent logic.",

Potentially, all symptoms reported for cytosolic ARS deficiencies represent the spectrum of a common clinical phenotype. Conversely, some features might be characteristic for specific ARS deficiencies. Nine cytosolic ARSs (IARS, LARS, MARS, QARS, KARS, RARS, DARS, and EPRS) form a multisynthetase complex (MSC). The major role ascribed to the MSC is to improve translational efficiency. Putatively, pathogenic variations in this subset of ARSs result in common symptoms based on deficient MSC function. Alternatively, symptoms might relate to specific amino acids (individually or to groups like branched chain amino acids), based on abundancy in specific proteins or to common (non)canonical amino acid or ARS functions. Combined cytosolic and mitochondrial ARS deficiencies obviously represent a specific subgroup, with mitochondrial dysfunction reflected in laboratory findings, muscle biopsy, and affected organs with high oxidative metabolism (brain, heart). Similarly, sensorineural hearing impairment is frequently seen in other mitochondrial ARS deficiencies, including LARS2, HARS2, RARS2,55 and IARS2.54 However, anemia and hypoalbuminemia in our KARS deficient patient and hepatosplenomegaly during infancy in QARS deficiencies46 might imply involvement of the cytosolic ARS deficiency. Conversely, although the multiorgan phenotype might suggest a mitochondriopathy, we did not find evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction caused directly by the cytosolic ARS deficiency.",

This also concurs with the prominence of symptoms during perinatal growth and infections, periods of high translational demand.

Furthermore, our IARS deficient patient developed cystic abnormalities with time, as reported in YARS deficient patients.38 PAP results from the accumulation of lipoproteins in pulmonary alveoli, leading to restrictive lung disease and respiratory failure.58 Most commonly involved in the pathogenesis is defective granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor activation, either through GM-CSF autoantibodies59 or rare pathogenic variations in GM-CSF receptor genes.60 This leads to deficient alveolar macrophage maturation, which is essential for macrophages to clear and recycle surfactant. Interestingly, among patients with autoimmune antisynthetase syndromes, antibodies against ARSs strongly predict interstitial lung disease.61 In addition, PAP is also a clinical characteristic of lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI), a rare inherited metabolic disease62 caused by a defective cationic amino acid transporter in the kidney, small bowel, lung, spleen, monocytes, and macrophages, resulting in leakage of cationic amino acids (arginine, ornithine, and lysine). Thus a shortage of amino acids, antibodies against ARSs, and genetic ARS deficiencies can all result in PAP, putatively through reduced aminoacylation and deficient translation to ensure adequate surfactant composition or homeostasis. Interestingly, LPI patients show considerable overlap in clinical phenotype with recessive ARS deficiencies, involving neurological impairment, failure to thrive, hepatosplenomegaly, PAP, renal tubulopathy, and hemophagocytic lymophohistiocytosis.62 The fact that both reduced amino acid concentrations and ARS deficiencies can result in common clinical symptoms concurs with insufficient aminoacylation for efficient translation as disease mechanism.",

This is in sharp contrast with the traditional management of replacing protein by glucose in patients with metabolic hepatic disease, but aligns with the previous advice to patients with LARS pathogenic variations29,30 to supply a minimum of 2.5 g/kg of whole protein either enterally or parenterally while unwell. This is supported by the restoration of growth upon increased intake with tube feeding in P1\u20133 (Fig. 2). Similarly, the clinical phenotype in a patient with MARS deficiency improved after starting parenteral nutrition33 and MARS aminoacylation activity and proliferation in yeast with mutant MARS alleles improved upon methionine supplementation.34",

This highlights the importance of deep phenotyping in patients with novel rare genetic diseases. Identification of a common clinical phenotype implies that recessive pathogenic variations in newly identified cytosolic ARSs may result in similar clinical symptoms, which might improve disease recognition and guide diagnostic work-up. Insufficient aminoacylation activity to meet high translational demand as common disease mechanism would also guide therapeutic care. As some residual enzyme activity seems essential for life, adequate supply of protein/amino acids is crucial, especially during periods of increased translational demand, including the first year of life and infections.",
