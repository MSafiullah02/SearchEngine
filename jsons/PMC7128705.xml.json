It soon caused considerable international alarm, after several index cases had given rise to outbreaks of sometimes enormous scales, and when the disease\u2019s ability to spread to distant areas within a very short period of time became obvious (World Health Organization, 2003d). A definition was developed for suspected and probable SARS cases, based on clinical and epidemiological criteria; it has since been modified on several occasions.",

In contrast to many other emerging viral infections such as Ebola, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, and Nipah, SARS also clearly demonstrated its ability for easy and rapid geographic spread.

However, further investigations did not confirm these findings; the said agents were indeed found in a number of SARS patients but not in all (WHO multicentre collaborative networks for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) diagnosis, 2003). Almost nobody knew at that stage that virologists in Beijing had already discovered a new virus in samples from some of the earliest SARS patients. However, the official line in China at the time was that the novel \u201catypical pneumonia\u201d was caused by Chlamydia (Enserink, 2003a). Nevertheless, before the end of March, laboratories in Hong Kong, Germany, Canada, and the United States of America found evidence of a novel coronavirus in patients with SARS by cell culture, electron microscopy, and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers at low stringency designed for other agents followed by sequencing (Peiris et al., 2003b; Drosten et al., 2003a; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Poutanen et al., 2003; Drosten et al., 2003b). These results could not rule out that very thorough and extensive testing had by chance led to the discovery of a novel agent that was not responsible for the new illness but rather an \u201cinnocent bystander\u201d. However, the sequences obtained in different parts of the world were shown to belong to the same, previously unrecognised, coronavirus (Ruan et al., 2003). It could also be shown that SARS patients underwent seroconversion against this coronavirus, using cells infected with patient isolates as antigen for indirect immunofluorescent antibody tests (Drosten et al., 2003a; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Fig. 1\n). Furthermore, no evidence of present or past infection with this agent could be detected in limited surveys of healthy control individuals not suffering from SARS (Ksiazek et al., 2003). This strengthened the case for the novel coronavirus being the cause of SARS, but only after it had been shown to cause a similar illness in artificially infected macaques could it be regarded as fulfilling all four of Koch\u2019s postulates (Fouchier et al., 2003; World Health Organisation Multicentre Collaborative Networks for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Diagnosis, 2003). On April 16, 2003, less than a month after the laboratory network had been brought into existence, WHO officially announced that a new coronavirus, never before seen in humans or animals and now provisionally termed SARS-associated coronavirus (abbreviated as SARS-CoV), was the cause of SARS (Kuiken et al., 2003).",

Most but not all viral particles display the characteristic appearance of surface projections, giving rise to the virus family\u2019s name (corona, Latin, = crown). They have the largest genomes of all RNA viruses. Based on their unique transcription strategy that involves the formation of \u201cnested\u201d mRNA molecules all sharing the same 3\u2019 end, the families Coronaviridae and Arteriviridae (of no significance to human virology) are grouped together in the order Nidovirales (nidus, Latin, = nest) (Cavanagh, 2000). Within the Coronaviridae, the genera Torovirus and Coronavirus (type species: infectious bronchitis virus, IBV) are distinguished. A unique feature of coronavirus genetics is a high frequency of RNA recombination as a result of discontinuous transcription and polymerase \u201cjumping\u201d (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997). One example is the porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV), which evolved in the early 1980s from the enteropathogenic porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), known since the 1940s (Pensaert et al., 1986). Through a large deletion in the S gene, the virus acquired an altered tissue tropism, causing mild respiratory infections.",

It has been proposed that the new virus defines a fourth lineage of coronavirus (Group IV) (Marra et al., 2003) (Fig. 4). However, more recently it was suggested that SARS-CoV may be an early split-off from the group 2 lineage (Snijder et al., 2003). The sequence analysis of SARS-CoV suggests that it is an animal virus with a still unknown natural host species that has recently developed the ability to productively infect humans. A genetically very close but not identical virus was found in wild animals (masked palm civets and a raccoon dog) from a wildlife market in Guangdong (Guan et al., 2003). But uncertainties remain over the exact source of this virus; the animals sampled could have been infected from humans or another animal species (Cyranoski and Abbott, 2003, Normile and Enserink, 2003.",

The first cases retrospectively identified as SARS occurred there in November 2002. Interestingly, amongst these early cases there seems to have been a significantly higher percentage of food handlers, chefs, etc. than in the general population, lending further support to a zoonotic origin. The worldwide spread of SARS-CoV was triggered through a single infected individual from Guangdong who spent some time in Hong Kong before succumbing to SARS (Chan-Yeung and Yu, 2003). During that time he unwittingly infected several others that in turn gave rise to a series of outbreaks (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2003). Through sometimes several generations of transmissions, this event carried the virus to different Hong Kong hospitals and communities as well as to Vietnam, Singapore, Canada, the United States of America, and beyond to a total of 30 countries and areas of the world (World Health Organization, 2003d). The virus travelled in infected humans and was passed on over several generations, as reflected in the genetic relatedness of isolates from these countries. Although China was late in admitting it, the SARS-CoV had unsurprisingly also been spread within mainland China; in the end, the worst affected area was the capital, Beijing, with 2521 cases in total, which surpasses the count for Guangdong with 1512 by far (World Health Organization Western Pacific Region, country office China: http://www.wpro.who.int/wr/chn/chn_sars.asp).",

Shedding of SARS-CoV in faeces and urine also occurs but its significance is unknown. The duration of infectivity is still unclear. Faecal shedding seems to last for several weeks; this however does not necessarily mean that there is sufficient excretion of infectious viral particles to infect other individuals (Peiris et al., 2003a). Practising stringent droplets and contact precaution significantly reduces the risk of infection after exposure to patients with SARS. Therefore, the protective role of the mask suggests that the main route of transmission is by droplets (Seto et al., 2003). SARS-CoV spreads more efficiently in sophisticated hospital settings. Evidence suggests that certain procedures, such as intubation under difficult circumstances and use of nebulizers increase the risk of infection (Chan-Yeung et al., 2003).",

These \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d were mostly very ill and often died from SARS, and invariably serious lapses in infection control precautions had occurred during their management. So far there is no evidence that differences in virus strains may be responsible for the \u201csuper-spreader\u201d phenomenon. There is also no firm evidence suggesting that subsequent transmissions led to clinically less severe illness, possibly through attenuation of the virus.

Using cells infected with the patient\u2019s own virus isolate and an antihuman IgG:FITC conjugate, we were able to demonstrate specific seroconversion in the two Frankfurt SARS patients (Drosten et al., 2003a; Fig. 1). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed that detects antibodies in the serum of SARS patients and reliably yields positive results at around day 21 after the onset of illness (World Health Organization Multicentre Collaborative Network for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Diagnosis, 2003). The neutralisation test (NT) assesses and quantifies, by means of titration, the ability of patient sera to neutralise the infectivity of SARS-CoV on cell culture; the NT titre may therefore be correlated to clinical immunity although this has yet to be demonstrated. However, NT is limited to institutions with BSL-3 facilities. The only antibody test commercially available so far is an IFA which yields a positive result from about day 10 after the onset of illness (Euroimmun, L\u00fcbeck, Germany). As the diagnosis of SARS is based entirely on a set of clinical and epidemiological criteria so far, reported case numbers are likely to include a substantial number of non-SARS patients. Therefore, recovered patients should be tested systematically for specific SARS-CoV antibody reactivity to confirm their diagnoses in retrospect and thus allow a better understanding of epidemiological and other features (Li et al., 2003).",

Although an effective vaccine cannot be expected to be available soon, the relative ease with which SARS-CoV can be propagated in vitro is clearly helpful. A suitable animal model for SARS may be available in the form of cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) (Kuiken et al., 2003). While the availability of vaccines against animal coronaviruses, such as avian infectious bronchitis virus, transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus of pigs, and feline infectious peritonitis virus, is encouraging, the obvious lack of protective immunity in humans after infection with HCoV OC43 and 229E is not. There is also currently no commercial veterinary vaccine to prevent respiratory coronavirus infections, except for infectious bronchitis virus infections in chickens. Further research is also urgently needed to determine whether immune pathogenesis plays a r\u00f4le in SARS or whether immune enhancement may occur, the chances of developing an effective and safe vaccine therefore remain uncertain. It is to be hoped that after such an encouraging start in an atmosphere of open collaboration and mutual trust, progress in SARS-CoV research will not be impeded by patent matters (Gold, 2003).",
