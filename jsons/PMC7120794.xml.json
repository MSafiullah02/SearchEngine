Both belonging to thrombus, acute arterial thrombus is white thrombus, while acute venous thrombus is red thrombus. What does the pathological difference mean? Venous thrombosis can autolyze, while arterial thrombosis cannot. For VTE patients, oral anticoagulants are usually recommended for 3, 6, or 12 months and occasionally lifelong, but the course cannot be determined. Furthermore, even with standard anticoagulation therapy and INR, some patients still develop chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Thus, the physicians are extremely puzzled about anticoagulant usage. Proposed risk factors for VTE include advanced age, infection, malignancy, autoimmune disease, surgery, trauma, pregnancy, long trip syndrome, family history, AMI, heart failure, and so on. Relevant risk factors are increasing over time. Risk factors are derived from the summary of evidence-based medicine. Although these factors are found to be associated with venous thrombosis, the intrinsic factors have not been well elucidated [1\u20134].",

DVT of cerebral cortical vein and cerebral venous sinus, acute PE, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, hepatic venule occlusion, DVT of mesenteric vein and pelvic vein, postoperative DVT and PE, and lower limb DVT are diagnosed in different departments, and thus VTE is almost a disease faced by clinicians in all departments. Of these DVTs, PE has a high morbidity, high misdiagnosis rate and high mortality and has been an important health problem worldwide [1, 2]. VTE can be classified as acquired and hereditary VTE. Epidemiological studies reveal that hereditary VTE has a low morbidity, and VTE is largely acquired VTE. Both hereditary VTE and acquired VTE can be grouped into symptomatic VTE if one can\u2019t be differentiated from the other (Figs. 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3).\n\n\n",

In the same group, the \u03b2 subunit is identical, but the \u03b1 subunit is distinct. At rest, the \u03b1 subunit is covered by the \u03b2 subunit, and thus the integrin is unable to bind to its ligands. Following activation, the extension of the \u03b2 subunit exposes the \u03b1 subunit. The \u03b1 subunit mainly mediates the specific and reversible binding between integrins and their ligands (Figs. 1.9 and 1.10), and the \u03b2 subunit dominates the signal transduction and regulation of integrins affinity [7\u20139].\n\n\n",

In simple terms, the immune system functions to expel all the foreign bodies including exogenous pathogenic microorganisms, grafts, foreign bodies in the wound, toxins, senescent cells, and malignant cells. The immune system can be divided into innate and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is present from birth and is also known as congenital immunity. Innate immune is an evolutionarily ancient defense strategy and is mainly composed of macrophages, granulocytes, NK cells, and complement system. Innate immune can recognize and subsequently clear foreign bodies and then present the information of these foreign bodies to T helper cells in adaptive immune. Adaptive immune is an acquired system during the lifetime of the organism. Immunological memory is a characteristic of adaptive immune and is highly specific to a particular pathogen. Thus, adaptive immune is also known as specific immune system and is composed of T cells and B cells. T helper cells are the core of the immune cells that regulate the cellular immunity and humoral immunity as well as the functions of phagocytes.",

            "text": "Genomics has the characteristics of wholeness, comprehensiveness, and directivity. Although the gene-guided protein synthesis often displays differences in the synthetic process and protein and cell analyses are usually required to confirm the results, the gene expression profile determined by genomic analysis may reflect the differentially expressed genes, and the functional analysis of these genes may determine global changes in a disease and present a direction to the understanding of the disease. The global analysis of genomics is superior to other tools.Gene ontology analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes in PE patients reflected the downregulation of T cell immune receptor complexes and T cell-mediated immunity as compared to control group [17].In respect of innate immunity, the genes related to phagocytes, NK cells, complements, and cytokines were compared between PE patients and controls.mRNA expression of phagocytes related genes: as compared to controls, the mRNA expression of pattern recognition receptor and conditioning receptors in phagocytes was significantly upregulated in PE patients, suggesting the enhancement of phagocyte function [18].mRNA expression of NK cell-related genes: when compared with control group, the mRNA expression of 7/10 of lectin-like receptors and natural cytotoxic effector receptors reduced significantly (P < 0.05), suggesting that the NK cell-mediated killing of target cells was significantly compromised [19].mRNA expression of genes related to complements: when compared with the control group, the mRNA expression of intrinsic ingredients of complements, receptors, and regulatory proteins was disordered, indicating the interrupted cascade reaction of complement system and the loss of complement-mediated membrane lysis [20].mRNA expression of genes related to cytokines: when compared with the control group, the mRNA expression of the following genes changed significantly in PE group.\n\nInterferon gene: mRNA expression of type I interferon reduced (P < 0.05), and IFN-\u03b3 mRNA expression decreased significantly (P < 0.01) in PE group [21].Interleukin: mRNA expression of Th1-related genes to Th2-related genes reduced in PE group, suggesting reduced killing activity [21, 22].Chemokines: mRNA expression of 12 CXC-related genes was significantly upregulated (P < 0.01) in PE group, and CXCL10 mRNA expression reduced markedly (P < 0.01); mRNA expression of 23 CC-related genes reduced dramatically in PE group (P < 0.01) [21].Tumor necrosis factor: Thirty-eight genes encoding members of the TNF superfamily and TNF receptor superfamily were examined. In PE patients, the mRNA expression levels of TNF superfamily members 1, 9, and 13, and TNF receptor superfamily members 1A, 1B, 9, 10B, 10C, 10D, and 19L, were significantly upregulated (P < 0.05), whereas TNF receptor superfamily members 11B, 19, and 25 were significantly downregulated compared to the controls (P < 0.05) [20].Colony stimulating factor: In PE group, the mRNA expression of CSF3, THPO, KITLG (P < 0.05), CSF2, and THPO (P < 0.01) changed significantly [21].Other cytokines: In PE group, the mRNA expression of TGFB1, TGFB1I1, EGF, and VEGF increased markedly (P < 0.01), but TGF B3 mRNA expression reduced dramatically (P < 0.05) [21].In PE patients, the mRNA expression of some cytokines was disordered, which reflects reduced killing activity against microorganisms, so the human body is susceptible to infection by virus, intracellular bacteria, and parasite [21].(e)In PE group, the mRNA expression of some integrins related to leukocytes and platelets was significantly upregulated; mRNA expression of L-selectin and PSGL-1 increased significantly, but E-selectin mRNA expression reduced markedly; mRNA expression of typical cadherin and cadherin precursor showed reducing tendency, and mRNA expression of VE-cadherin reduced significantly; mRNA expression of immunoglobulin superfamily members remained unchanged. These findings indicate that the leukocyte adhesion is significantly enhanced; the platelet adhesion is markedly enhanced; the activity of endothelial cells is significantly compromised; the adhesion between endothelial cells is markedly compromised, leading to the increased endothelial permeability [23].(f)Thirteen differentially expressed genes were leukocyte-related integrin genes. In PE group, mRNA expression of integrin \u03b21 and \u03b22 increased significantly (P < 0.05); platelet-related integrins (n = 7) displayed changed mRNA expression in PE group, of which the mRNA expression of integrin \u03b21 and \u03b23 increased significantly (P < 0.05); the mRNA expression of other ten integrins was either up- or downregulated. These imply that the mRNA expression of leukocyte- and platelet-related integrins is significantly upregulated, and the mRNA expression of fibronectin- and fibrinogen-related integrins also changed markedly [23].\n\n3.In respect of adaptive immunity, the expression of T cell- and B cell-related genes was compared between the PE and control groups.T lymphocyte-related genes in PE group: of six genes related to the T lymphocyte immune synapses, receptor complex, cytoplasmic membrane, and receptors, the mRNA expression of ZAP70, CD247, GZMB (P < 0.05), GZMA, CD3G, and CD3 D (P < 0.01) decreased dramatically [18].Genes related to B cells: a total of 82 differentially expressed genes were related to B cell activation. These genes included (1) B cell receptor-related genes (the mRNA expression of LYN, CD22, SYK (P < 0.05), BTK, PTPRC, and NFAM1 (P < 0.01) was significantly upregulated, but the mRNA expression of FYN (P < 0.05), FCRL4, and LAX1 (P < 0.01) was markedly downregulated in PE group), (2) T cell-dependent B cell activation-related genes (the mRNA expression of EMR2 (P < 0.05), TNFSF9, CD86, ICOSLG, CD37, and CD97 (P < 0.05) was significantly upregulated, but the SPN mRNA expression was markedly downregulated (P < 0.05)), and (3) T cell nondependent B cell activation-related genes (the mRNA expression of LILRA1 and TLR9 increased dramatically in PE patients (P < 0.01) [24]).\n4.Regulator-related genes: In PE group, the mRNA expression of CR1, LILRB4, and VAV1 was significantly upregulated (P < 0.01) but that of SLAMF7 reduced markedly (P < 0.01) [21].5.Genes of B cell-related cytokines: In PE group, the mRNA expression of LTA (P < 0.05) and IL-10 (P < 0.01) increased significantly but that of L1A, IFNA5, IFNA6, IFNA8, IFNA14 (P < 0.05), IL2, IL13, and IFNG (P < 0.01) reduced markedly. These indicate that there is B cell dysfunction in PE patients [24].Phagocytes, NK cells, complement system, T cells, and B cells are the important components of innate and adaptive immune systems, and both of them play important roles in the defense against pathogens. These components together exert the defense effects. Results from genomic analysis indicate that the expression of phagocyte-related genes increases significantly but that of NK cell-related genes reduces markedly, the expression of complement-related genes is disordered but that of cytokine-related genes shows imbalance, and the expression of T cell-related genes reduces dramatically and that of B cell-related genes is disordered. These imply that the balance of systemic immune cell function collapses.\n",

Results showed the combined immune function (killing of target cells) was lost. NK cells, CD8\n+ T cells, and complement form membrane attack complex to kill the target cells in which the perforin drills a hole in the target cells, leading to the release of granzymes and the death of these target cells. The mutation of the perforin gene may cause the generation of abnormal protein (Fig. 1.21b), resulting in loss of function. In patients with symptomatic PE, genomic analysis showed the mRNA expression of granzyme in T cells reduced significantly, suggesting the compromised killing activity of T cells. Although perforin and granzyme act at different steps of killing of target cells, the gene mutation of perforin in familial VTE patients and reduced mRNA expression of granzyme in patients with symptomatic PE cause the same consequence: compromised killing activity of immune cells [25].\n",

The results from cytological examination are consistent with those from genomic analysis and both indicate the compromised immune cell balance. T cells are the core component of immune cells. In T helper (Th) cells, Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells may regulate cellular, humoral, and innate immunity, respectively. The compromised T cell function may significantly reduce the systemic immune function. The collapse of immune cell balance function refers to the nonfunctional state or a state of significantly compromised function of immune cells. In VTE patients, cytological examination reveals that the T cell function is significantly compromised, and genomic analysis indicates that the function of systemic immune cells is significantly inhibited. These suggest that the immune cells become dysfunctional and present a collapsed state of immune cell balance function.",

The risk for VTE in malignancy patients is 4\u20137 times higher than in subjects without malignancy [36\u201338]. The occurrence of malignancy is a consequence of ineffective and delayed clearance of malignant cells by immune cells. We reported that there were necrosis, granulation tissues and rupture of small veins on the sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma, and dark-staining fibrinogen in the vein formed filament-like mesh [13, 14]. In addition, in the necrotic area of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the stomach, a large amount of red cells were observed outside the blood vessels (Fig. 1.23); cancer cells were observed around the veins, and dark-staining fibrinogen formed filament-like mesh in which there were a large amount of cancer cells; the filament-like mesh was able to block the hematogenous metastasis of cancer cells. Based on these findings, we speculate that the occurrence of VTE and hemorrhage in malignancy patients is consequent to the invasion of cancer cells into surrounding veins and arteries due to the unlimited proliferation of cancer cells and is a product in the proliferative phase of cancer cells.\n",
