At this point, while we are still in the early stages of this crisis, where emergency medical care and reducing pressure on health services are the priority, we look to our clinicians, epidemiologists, and experts in the biomedical sciences for frontline solutions. However, we must think more broadly about the role of materials science.",

It is tempting to think that the development of new antiviral agents is beyond the scope of what we traditionally call materials science, yet the scientific literature belies this view, where the impact can be had is in the development of new delivery vectors which enhance the properties of existing antiviral agents, such as their pharmacokinetics, and reduce unwanted side effects. One of the contributions from materials and chemistry is covered in an Invited Viewpoint in this issue [2] .",

[3] demonstrated nontoxic, broad-spectrum antiviral cyclodextrins (a type of cyclic sugar), modified with mercaptoundecane sulfonic acids, which were shown to be virucidal at micromolar concentrations in vitro against a range of viruses including herpes simplex virus (HSV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), dengue virus, and Zika virus. Earlier work by Cagno et al. [4] demonstrated the importance of strong multivalent binding, leading to virus deformation and loss of infectivity, which was achieved by the modification of gold nanoparticles with the same undecane sulfonic acid. ''Nanosponges'' based around branched polymeric cyclodextrins have found promise as potential antiviral drug delivery vectors [5] , while flexible nano-gels which can mimic the heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the cell surface and have been shown to shield viruses and block their entry to the cell [6] .",

Discussion of the deployment, efficacy, and availability of tests has run to many thousands of words, with the only agreement seeming to be that wide-scale testing is critical to understand the spread of infection. Again, looking to the future, the design and fabrication of new materials may here play a role. The detection limit for HIV has been improved by the use of magnetic microparticles together with nanoparticles tagged with oligonucleotide ''bar codes'' which improve the real-time immuno-PCR amplification process for the detection of HIV [7] . Voltammetric detection of viral hepatitis has also been demonstrated with the use of ferrocene-capped gold nanoparticles conjugated to DNA [8] . While these examples only provide a snapshot of the current research capability, and clearly there is a more pressing need for immediately available diagnostics, it is conceivable that through collaboration, rapid development of testing for COVID-19 and related viral infections can be achieved in the near future.",

Any new discovery which works in the laboratory must be rigorously tested, scaled up, and implemented in such a way that that it confers added benefits over the current state of the art. There are many factors to be considered, including complexity of fabrication and usage, cost-effectiveness, and stability. Translation to a clinical setting requires adherence to regulatory frameworks which are generally outside of the skills set of the bench-based materials scientist. This is why, more than ever, working across the disciplines is crucial if we are to reap the benefits of any new technology.",

Though physical distance temporarily separates us, we should strive to collaborate across scientific ''continents,'' listening to experts in other fields and offering our expertise where we can.
