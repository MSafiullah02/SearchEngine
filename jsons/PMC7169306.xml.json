The Frankfurt\u20101 strain of SARS\u2010CoV was kindly provided by Dr John Ziebuhr (University of W\u00fcrzburg, W\u00fcrzburg, Germany), through Dr Fumihiro Taguchi (National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan). For the infectivity assay, Vero E6 cells were seeded in a 96\u2010well microplate (4 \u00d7 105 cells/ml, 0\u00b71 ml/well) and, after overnight culture at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2/air, the cells were inoculated with serial 10\u2010fold dilutions of the virus stock solution (0\u00b71 ml/well, five wells per dilution). On day 3 of culture, virus infectivity [the tissue culture infectivity dose 50% (TCID50/ml), log10] was calculated by using Karber's method [2].",

However, its infectivity in the anti\u2010thrombin III preparation persisted, despite heating for 30 min at 60 \u00b0C, although the same amount of heating inactivated the virus in the other three preparations (Fig. 1). This result was confirmed by an independent experiment (data not shown). Furthermore, when Frankfurt\u20101 was inoculated into the solutions containing the stabilizer alone (without protein), 30 min of heating inactivated the virus to below the detection limit in all four products (data not shown), suggesting that the combination of the blood product preparation and its stabilizer affected the heat sensitivity of the virus. Rabenau and his colleagues also conducted experiments using the SARS\u2010CoV FFM\u20101 strain. As in our study, they found that while the virus was stabilized by heating at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min in the presence of 20% FBS, it was inactivated at 60 \u00b0C in the presence and absence of 20% FBS [3]. In this context therefore we must take into consideration the combination of the plasma products and the stabilizer.",
