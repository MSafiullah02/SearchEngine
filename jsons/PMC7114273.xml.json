Moreover, molecular analysis of S gene of BCoV has been conducted and compared mainly between American and Canadian isolates and/or strains (Chouljenko et al., 1998, Hasoksuz et al., 2002, Gelinas et al., 2001, Rekik and Dea, 1994).

RNA was extracted from the supernatant fluids of HRT-18G cells infected with 10 KWD strains, based on the acid quanidinium\u2013phenol\u2013chloroform RNA extraction method as described by Cho et al. (2001a). As a negative control, RNA was extracted from mock-infected HRT-18G cells. The oligonucleotide primers used in the RT-PCR were designed from the published sequence of the S gene of the Mebus strain (GenBank accession no. U00735). The sequence of primers (positions calculated from the start codon of the S gene) are as follows: 1st upstream primer, 5\u2032-ATGTTTTTGATACTTTTAATTTCC-3\u2032 (1\u201324); 1st downstream primer, 5\u2032-ACACCAGTAGATGGTGCTAT-3\u2032 (901\u2013920); 2nd upstream primer, 5\u2032-GGGTTACACCTCTCACTTCT-3\u2032 (782\u2013801); 2nd downstream primer, 5\u2032-GCAGGACAAGTGCCTATACC-3\u2032 (1531\u20131550); 3rd upstream primer, 5\u2032-CTGTCCGTGTAAATTGGATG-3\u2032 (1459\u20131478); 3rd downstream primer, 5\u2032-TGTAGAGTAATCCACACGT-3\u2032 (2268\u20132286); 4th upstream primer, 5\u2032-TTC ACGACAGCTGCAACCTA-3\u2032 (2151\u20132170); 4th downstream primer, 5\u2032-CCATGGTAACACCAATCC CA-3\u2032 (3003\u20133022); 5th upstream primer, 5\u2032-CCCTGTATTAGGTTGTTTAG-3\u2032 (2691\u20132710); 5th downstream primer, 5\u2032-ACCACTACCAGTGAACATCC-3\u2032 (3587\u20133606); 6th upstream primer, 5\u2032-GTGCAGAATGCTCCATATGGT-3\u2032 (3439\u20133459); 6th downstream primer, 5\u2032-TTAGTCGTCATGTGATGTTT-3\u2032 (4073\u20134092). A one-step RT-PCR assay was performed as described by Cho et al., 2001a, Cho et al., 2001b. The RT-PCR products were purified using a GenClean II kit (BIO 101, Inc., LaJolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Spike protein further divided it into S1 and S2 segments of approximately 86 and 65 kDa, respectively, at the cleavage site aa 768. Among all strains analyzed, a total of 77 and 52 polymorphic nucleotides were identified in the S1 and S2 subunit of the spike glycoprotein of BCoV, respectively, compared with the Mebus strain (data not shown). These polymorphisms led to 46 and 24 aa changes at 41 and 20 distinct sites, respectively. We have shown recently that the respiratory and enteric isolates collected concurrently from two different calves in USA were significantly distinct from the ancestral enteric strain, Mebus (Hasoksuz et al., 2002). By drawing comparisons of deduced aa between our strains and other known BCoV, the two most similar sequences were those of KWD10 strain and RBCV LSU strain (96.6%) in paired comparisons, and the most distant were those of the KWD5 strain and the Mebus strain (93.4%). All the virulent-KWD strains tended to be distant from the ancestral enteric strain, Mebus, suggesting that allelic variation resulted in genetic drift over time (Hasoksuz et al., 2002).",

The aa sequences of 10 KWD strains were more homologous to each other and were very closely related to the virulent RBCV OK and EBCV LY-138 strains, among the other known BCoV studied in paired comparisons (Fig. 1). These data showed that the WD BCoVs circulated in Korea were genetically similar to both RBCV and EBCV. In addition, the phylogenetic comparison of Korean WD strains with other known BCoVs, on the sequences of the hypervariable region, revealed that all Korean WD strains were also clustered in groups with the virulent RBCV OK and BCQ3994 strains, and the virulent EBCV LY-139 strain (Fig. 2\n). The Canadian BCQ CD and WD strains, the American RBCV LSU strain, French EBCV F15 strain and avirulent VACC, L9 and Mebus strains were clustered on a separate major branch (Fig. 2). Therefore, these results indicated that the BCoV strains may be diverging from an enteric tropism to a dual (respiratory and enteric) tropism over time via intermediates (Hasoksuz et al., 2002). This speculation could be supported by our previous paper (Cho et al., 2001a) in which gnotobiotic and colostrum-deprived calves were inoculated with respiratory isolates of BCoV shed viruses, both nasally and rectally. This subsequently induced diarrhea. Moreover, feedlot cattle, which had shown respiratory disease signs at arrival time, developed diarrhea 4 days after arrival, which peaked at 4\u20137 days post arrival (Cho et al., 2001b). Further study will be needed on the differences in pathogenicity, antigenicity, or any other physicochemical characteristics between the KWD strains.",

The hypervariable region showed varied antigenicity when reacting with Mabs directed against the S glycoprotein. Therefore, Chouljenko et al. (1998) reported that four RBCV-specific aa substitutions at aa 510, 531, 543, and 578 can be predictive and Mabs-specific strains for this region may also be distinguished among respiratory, enteric, and vaccine BCoV strains. In the present study, three aa sites including aa 510, 543, and 578 of RBCV OK and LSU strains were identical in all Korean WD strains (Fig. 3\n). In our previous paper (Hasoksuz et al., 2002), enteric and respiratory BCoV pairs collected concurrently from two feedlot calves in USA also had identical aa substitution sites at the same sites. Furthermore, aa 531 (N \u2192 G) substitution of RBCV OK and LSU strains compared with the Mebus strain was also detected in the CD strain BCQ 1523 (data not shown). Since these changes were observed in WD, CD, and RBCV strains, our data does not support the speculation of Chouljenko et al. (1998). In addition, aa 13 and 744 of the S1 subunit have been reported for EBCV-specific sites, which were observed in EBCV strains F15 and LY (Chouljenko et al., 1998). However, aa 13 and 744 of the S1 subunit of all Korean WD strains were identical with those of LSU and OK strains of RBCV, BCQ7373, and BCQ2590 of WD isolates, Mebus, and L9 avirulent strains (Fig. 3). In particular, aa 744, reporting its sequence in many isolates and/or strains, are the same as other known BCoV including RBCV, CD, WD, and EBCV. These results imply that these aa sites are EBCV F15 and LY strain-specific, or that there are no EBCV-specific sites in the S gene.",

Amino acid substitutions in this region could alter the tropism of the coronavirus. For example, the first 200 aa of the S1 subunit of the PRCV were associated with respiratory tropism and reduced enteropathogenicity (Wesley et al., 1991).

Interestingly, all KWD strains had an Ala to Ser change at aa 769, immediately upstream of the cleavage site. Since this change was observed exclusively in the respiratory isolates LSU and OK, it was speculated that the change in aa 769 was a potential marker of respiratory tropism (Chouljenko et al., 1998). Although changes in aa surrounding the cleavage site of the HA molecule of the influenza A virus and Sendai virus have been demonstrated to modulate its cleavability (Rott et al., 1984, Hsu et al., 1987), Rekik and Dea (1994) reported that this change (769; A \u2192 S) did not appear to modulate cleavability, the rate of viral replication or the type of cytopathic changes induced in HRT-18 cells for their enteric BCoV isolates. In our previous paper (Hasoksuz et al., 2002), this change (769; A \u2192 S) was observed in both respiratory and enteric strains.
