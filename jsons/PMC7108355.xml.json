HRV-C has now been detected from patients with respiratory infections worldwide.17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 We have also previously demonstrated HRV-C as important causes of hospitalizations due to respiratory illness in both adults and children.29 While other respiratory viruses such as human bocavirus (HBoV) have been associated with gastroenteritis,16, 30, 31 little is known about the association of HRV-C in diseases other than respiratory infections.",

Although HRV-C has recently been found in the stool of two young children from Switzerland and Finland respectively, both patients had severe pneumonia and evidence of systemic infections. In the report from Switzerland, HRV-C was detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimen, pericardial fluid, plasma and stool of a 14-month-old child with pneumonia and pericarditis.36 The report from Finland described the detection of HRV-C in nasopharyngeal, bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchial specimens, stool and urine of a 3-week-old neonate with severe pneumonia and prolonged infection.37 Such fecal shedding of HRV-C therefore likely represented part of the disseminated viral infections with pneumonia.36, 37 In this study, three of the four children with HRV-C detected in fecal samples presented with diarrhea in the absence of respiratory symptoms, while the other also had acute bronchiolitis. As other potential diarrheal pathogens were also detected in the fecal samples from the former three children, the role of HRV-C in gastroenteritis remains to be determined. We have previously demonstrated HRV-C strains associated with respiratory infections as a clade of diverse genotypes that may easily evade immune protection.29 Analysis of VP4 sequences of the four HRV-C fecal strains showed that they belonged to the existing clade of diverse HRV-C genotypes, indistinguishable from respiratory strains (data not shown). This suggested that any HRV-C strain may be associated with respiratory or enteric disease. Moreover, HRV-C, as well as HRV-A, may possess similar biological properties as other enteroviruses, with the ability to replicate in gastrointestinal tract epithelium. Despite recent findings in ex vivo organ culture, HRV-C has not been successfully isolated in either airway or gastrointestinal cell lines.38 As a result, study of its tissue tropism and pathogenesis has been limited. Further studies are warranted to better understand the role and epidemiology of HRV-C in gastroenteritis and other diseases.",

The 5\u2032-NCR was used for initial PCR screening for HRV-C because it is a highly conserved region and is well known to be much more sensitive than other genome regions for picornavirus detection. Although sequence analysis of the 5\u2032-NCR suggested the presence of potential HRVs or other enteroviruses, further identification of the picornavirus species using VP4 and 3Dpol was only successful in 32 samples. The failure to amplify the VP4 and 3Dpol genes of picornaviruses in other samples may be due to the less conserved sequences than 5\u2032-NCR or mutations in the primer regions. The 32 samples were shown to contain picornaivruses belonging to six different species, including 21 belonging to PV. The frequent detection of PV was not unexpected, as oral PV vaccine was routinely administered to our infants and PV was known to be isolated for up to 7 weeks after oral vaccination.39 Although picornaviruses, except HPeV, are not generally thought to be associated with gastroenteritis, many are transmitted by fecal\u2013oral route and commonly isolated from stool. HRVs have also been occasionally detected in stool samples during search for viruses in other diseases, but detailed sequence analysis was lacking.40, 41 The present study showed that shedding of various picornaviruses, including HRVs, is common in children with gastroenteritis. Moreover, co-detection of different pathogens could be observed, similar to respiratory virus infections where co-infections are common.16, 42\n",

Interestingly, the two strains each belonged to two distinct clades of HPeV1. Further studies may help delineate the genetic diversity of HPeV1 in our population and other countries.",
