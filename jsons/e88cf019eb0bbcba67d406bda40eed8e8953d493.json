Therefore, platelet count can act as a sensitive indicator of illness severity and shows early changes in conditions, indirectly reflecting the body's ability to resist the disease. Recent studies reported that the lungs of COVID-19 patients showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage, which was very similar to those found in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections [27] . There were several reasons why the platelets of COVID-19 patients declined in the early stages. On the one hand, viral infection induced lung tissue damage, resulting in activation, aggregation, and entrapment of the platelet. This led to thrombosis at the lung injury site, which increased the consumption of platelet. On the other hand, mature megakaryocytes may release platelets in the lungs. Therefore, when the damaged lungs caused pulmonary fibrosis and pathological changes, production of platelet might be affected [28] . Furthermore, virus infection may bring about immune damages to platelets by inducing auto-antibodies and immune complexes. The use of immunomodulators and short courses of corticosteroids at low-to-moderate dose may potentially be helpful for critically ill patients with COVID-19, using, essentially, very personalized attitude towards each particular patient.",

When platelet count changes in the early stages of the disease, it can sensitively reflect the severity of the patient's condition. Progression of disease is related to the risk of lowering the platelet count, and reduced platelet count may also aggravate the disease. They are interrelated and each subtly influencing one another. What's more, a downward trend of platelet count is more informative than whether it is within the normal range. The blood routine test is easy to carry out and it is inexpensive. We believe that frequent measurements of the platelet count may be helpful for the treatment of COVID-19, leading to more effective measures much earlier.",

The 2012 EPMA white paper and the 2016 EPMA position paper both highlight the significance of suitable biomarker to early and predictive diagnostics and targeted prevention [10, 11] . Our findings conform with the predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM) concepts of the above two papers and further refine their content, showing the practical application of PPPM in particular case of worldwide epidemic of SARS-CoV-2. Our data indicate that platelet count has important information, which could be used for improved prediction, patient stratification (moderate vs high severity of the disease), and personalized prevention needed for the COVID-19-infected individuals, in order to save lives and economical resources.
