Signs and symptoms were defined according to Denny and Clyde.14 Recruitment covered the period from November 1999 to October 2001. Nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS) were collected in a standardized manner as described.13 Of the 3.677 NPS that were collected within the PRI.DE study, half were randomly assigned to this study. The randomization was performed via a program generating random numbers in order to distribute samples equally between 2 different laboratories. The ethics committee of each participating center approved the study protocol and written informed consent was obtained from parents of all children. RNA was extracted and tested for RSV, PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3, influenza viruses and HCoV-NL63 by hexaplex PCR and real-time RT-PCR as described.10 Samples collected in France (winter 2003/2004) and the Netherlands (2002 till 2005) that were screened for HCoV-NL63 were analyzed as described.6, 15 Furthermore, data from literature were included only for those studies that screened consecutive years in Western Europe and in which each year the sample selection criteria did not change.

The hospitalization rate is 85 per 100,000 children per year, corresponding to 2022 hospitalizations per year in Germany. However, during double infections it is debatable whether one or the combination of the two viruses causes the disease encountered. Double infections with HCoV-NL63 and a second respiratory virus were frequently found (49.3%). Furthermore we observed a very strong association between a high HCoV-NL63 viral load and single infections, and in case of double infections the viral load was low (p\n < 0.0001, Wilcoxon's two sample test).10 To ascertain that the disease burden is calculated for HCoV-NL63 infections only and not influenced by infections with another respiratory virus we included only those infections which were not accompanied by a second respiratory virus (n\n = 35). Furthermore we included merely HCoV-NL63 infections with high viral load, which was arbitrarily defined as samples with more than 10,000 copies per ml (n\n = 25). Using these restrictions we calculated that the annual incidence of HCoV-NL63 infection was 7 per 1000 children per year (95% confidence interval (CI) 3\u201313 per 1000 children per year), reflecting an absolute number of 16,929 visits to the physician in Germany per year (95% CI: 7255\u201331,440). The estimated hospitalization rate due to HCoV-NL63 alone is 22 per 100,000 children (95% CI: 7\u201349 per 100,000 children per year). This number reflects 522 children in Germany per year (95% CI: 166\u20131163), which is a conservative estimate.",

            "text": "The winter season is the preferred season for infection by HCoV-NL63, yet large year-to-year differences in frequency is apparent. As shown in Fig. 1, infection by HCoV-NL63 is limited to a small percentage in the first year of the study, whereas in the winter of 2000/01 the frequency reaches levels above 10%. This indicates that there is an inter-epidemic period,17 but it cannot be determined whether HCoV-NL63 peaks every 2, 3 or more years. To investigate this periodicity and the inter-epidemic period we combined literature data and performed additional screening for HCoV-NL63 in hospitalized patients and outpatients with acute respiratory infections in the Netherlands and France during the period 2001 till 2005. A higher frequency of infection in the winters of 2000/01, 2002/03 and 2004/05 and less infections in the 2001/02 and 2003/04 winter was observed (Table 3\nand 15, 18, 19), indicating that the frequency is high every other year. To verify whether the inter-epidemic period is 2 years we combined all our data and the published data on HCoV-NL63 screenings during 2 or more consecutive years in Western Europe6, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and confirmed that in 2000/2001, 2002/2003 and 2004/2005 significantly higher infection rates are observed compared to 1999/2000, 2001/2002 and 2003/2004 (combined rates 4.5% vs 1.5%, p\n < 0.0001, Chi-square test, Fig. 2\n).",

Therefore, sampling in paediatric practices provides the opportunity to collect a representative patient set that reflects the population of German children that are ill but not hospitalized. Most studies that have looked at the frequency of HCoV-NL63 infection in patients with respiratory infections have focused exclusively at hospitalized patients. In the PRI.DE study it is possible to investigate the frequency of infection in both groups: those hospitalized and those visiting the paediatric clinic (outpatients). In a previous study we noticed that HCoV-NL63 infection is observed more frequently in outpatients,10 and here we calculated that it reflects almost 17,000 visits to the paediatrician each year in Germany, whereas less than 600 children under the age of 3 years need to be hospitalized.",

The difference in age of the test populations is unlikely to explain the difference. We think that other reasons are more significant. In the Hong Kong study all HCoV-NL63-children were included regardless of the viral load in the NPA, or the presence of a second infection. Furthermore, only a single year was monitored in Hong Kong, and we noticed that the incidence of HCoV-NL63 displays year-to-year differences with a 3\u20134 times higher rate in uneven winters in Western Europe. We did not include any double infections and HCoV-NL63 infections with low viral load, to diminish the chance that children who are ill due to another respiratory virus infection are counted. In addition, it cannot be ruled out that we even missed some double infections since our samples were not tested for all respiratory pathogens (e.g. hMPV, human bocavirus, and rhinoviruses).",
