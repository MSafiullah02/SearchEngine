Systematic reviews on telerehabilitation interventions poststroke have demonstrated either better or equal salutary effects on motor, higher cortical, and mood disorders compared with conventional face-to-face therapy. 13 However, studies on the effectiveness of telerehabilitation for nonstroke conditions are still lacking.

The coronavirus can persist on inanimate surfaces at typical room temperatures and humidity for up to 9 days but inactivated efficiently by surface disinfection procedures with 62%-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute. 14 Although evidence on infection control specific to rehabilitation settings is sparse, limited data have shown persistence of bacterial contaminants in rehabilitation equipment such as electrode sponges, water for hot pack units, topical lotions, and therapy ball pits.

With the exception of clerical staff and telerehabilitation, it is impractical for rehabilitation HCWs to work from home because our discipline is very handson. Hence, strategies like split teams and restricted movement are more relevant in rehabilitation. Split teams is complete physical division of a workforce into (usually 2) subteams with each containing the necessary skill sets to continue most of its functions if 1 subteam becomes unable to work. Restricted movement is another strategy whereby the principle is every member in a subteam does not come in physical contact with any staff from other subteam(s) to minimize risk of cross-infection. Hospital management should also review triage processes at entry points and workflows that separate high-risk from low-risk areas and subteams. Other often forgotten issues are HCWs who are parents of young children. If schools or day care centers close and both parents are working, HCWs may be forced to stay home to look after them. HCWs may also be afraid to return home after work in fear of passing loved ones the virus if infected and infectious during the asymptomatic phase.

Activate the highest level of national Response Management protocols to ensure the all-of-government and all-of-society approach needed to contain COVID-19 with nonpharmaceutical public health measures. 2. Prioritize active, exhaustive case finding and immediate testing and isolation, painstaking contact tracing, and rigorous quarantine of close contacts. 3. Fully educate the general public on the seriousness of COVID-19 and their role in preventing its spread. 4. Expand surveillance to detect COVID-19 transmission chains, by testing all patients with atypical pneumonias, conducting screening in some patients with upper respiratory illnesses and/or recent COVID-19 exposure, and adding testing for the COVID-19 virus to existing surveillance systems (eg, systems for influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infections). 5. Conduct multisector scenario planning and simulations for the deployment of even more stringent measures to interrupt transmission chains as needed (eg, the suspension of large-scale gatherings and the closure of schools and workplaces).",
