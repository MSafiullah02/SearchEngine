In patients with respiratory failure due to coronavirus, transport out of the ICU for open tracheostomy (OT) may be limited or restricted due to risk of viral exposure to staff and to physiological instability, making bedside percutaneous tracheostomy (PT) necessary.

A systematic review estimated the odds of transmission from tracheostomy (OR 4.2) as second only to intubation (OR 6.6). 6 However, there was a paucity of studies on tracheostomy that prohibited a direct comparison of the procedures. In our opinion, current data vastly underestimate the risk of tracheostomy, in which droplet and blood splatter is virtually guaranteed.

            "text": "Surgeons should consider both short-term and long-term outcomes of tracheostomy along with the risks of exposure of the clinical team. In many cases tracheostomy should be deferred until the patient has ceased viral shedding. In some circumstances, tracheostomy may accelerate ventilator weaning, 4 which might improve throughput of patients with Covid-19 in the hospital system, making room for new patients if ICU resources and ventilators become scarce. This is important since, depending on the trajectory of the pandemic in the USA, it is projected that the need for ventilators may far exceed the number of devices available, currently estimated at approximately 75 000 including those available in the Strategic National Stockpile 13 and another 98 000 ventilators that can perform only basic functions. 14 The long-term outcomes after tracheostomy in non-surgical patients are poor, with a 1-year mortality of 46.5% overall and 54.7% for those over age 65 years, 15 and these data may be useful in having goals of care discussions with families. In the absence of large-scale triage, the decision to perform a tracheostomy in a patient with Covid-19 currently should be made on a case-by-case basis and with multidisciplinary input, maintaining a patient-centered and family-centered and caregiver safetyfocused approach. It should be emphasized that data on tracheostomy in this population are very limited. Patients with severe disease likely are not physiologically stable enough to undergo the procedure, and patients who are recovering from the disease may benefit from traditional ventilator weaning and liberation strategies. At this time, we recommend against performing tracheostomy in patients with active Covid-19 disease.",

The risk of complications and death are similar between OT and PT, except that stoma site infections are more common with OT. 4 The choice of OT or PT may be made based on an individual patient's clinical condition, anatomy, the operator's experience with each technique and logistical considerations such as the risk of transportation (if necessary) to the operating room for OT. preparation and procedural safety 1. Perform in a negative pressure airborne infection isolation room (AIIR). a. If an AIIR is not available, avoid entry into room by nonessential personnel for up to 3 hours due to persistence of viable virus in aerosols. 18 2. Limit the number of participants in the room to essential personnel only. 19 3. An experienced attending surgeon or other experienced practitioner should perform the procedure. a. Trainees should not be involved unless absolutely necessary 19 to expedite the procedure and avoid unnecessary risk. 4. Post a runner outside the room to aid communication and to obtain new equipment as needed. 5. Take only essential equipment into the room, including an oversupply of any medications that will be needed. Have potentially necessary and backup equipment immediately outside the room. a. It is important to avoid delays or interruptions after starting the procedure due to lack of equipment or sedative medications. 6. Ensure presence of a HEPA viral filter on the ventilator and suctioning equipment. 7. Perform standard hand hygiene and use a double glove technique, which has been recommended to reduce risk of viral transfer during doffing of PPE. 20 Wear a fluid-resistant gown. Double gowning has also been recommended by some. 21 8. Use a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) with standard donning as recommended by the CDC. Use an N95 mask under the PAPR hood as backup in the event of PAPR mechanical failure. a. According to the CDC, not using a respirator mask during an aerosol-generating procedure upgrades the risk of healthcare personnel from low risk to medium risk. 9 b. According to the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation, PAPR is superior to a mask for protection from viral transmission. 11 c. Respirator efficacy is measured by the assigned protection factor (APF). PAPRs used in healthcare typically have an APF of 25, while N95 masks filter 95% of particles and have an APF of 10. 22 d. PAPR has been recommended based on experience with the SARS epidemic in Asia. 21 e. During non-procedural situations, in the event of failure of PAPR gear, healthcare personnel are instructed to leave the room immediately since they are no longer protected from airborne viral transmission. Suddenly aborting a tracheostomy procedure at a critical moment could result in airway loss and death. Therefore, we recommend wearing an N95 mask under the PAPR as a backup to allow completion of the procedure should the PAPR fail. f. If situations where a PAPR is not available, personnel should use an N95 or higher mask, along with a fluid shield and full eye protection. 9. Use neuromuscular blockade in addition to full sedation/analgesia to prevent coughing and resultant particulate spread. a. Routine paralysis has been recommended by practitioners involved with tracheostomy during the SARS outbreak of 2002 in Asia 21 23 and other specialty societies. 24 10. Fully drape the entire patient and bed to avoid any contamination of the bed, pillow, sheets or equipment. a. Use a double layer of impervious draping to prevent soak-through. b. Place instruments on a flat tray or table instead of on the patient to avoid equipment rolling or falling off the bed. 11. Place a cuffed, non-fenestrated tracheostomy tube. 24 Inflate cuff after placement and check to ensure absence of a cuff leak (see Technical considerations for PT and OT below). 12.

Bronchoscopy itself is an aerosol-generating procedure and could pose an addition risk of exposure. While there is insufficient evidence that its use decreases the number of complications during tracheostomy, 4 c. If opting not to use bronchoscopy, consider alternative methods to determine withdrawal of the endotracheal tube above the tracheotomy site, including but not limited to: 1. Palpation with a finger on the trachea while the endotracheal tube is being withdrawn; the surgeon can feel the trachea become softer and more pliable as the tube is withdrawn above the proposed tracheotomy site. 2. Use of a Doppler over the incision site; when the endotracheal tube is withdrawn above the proposed tracheotomy site, the audible volume from air flow through the end of the tube will be much louder. 3. Blind placement of the needle, using aspiration of air or bubbles in a fluid-filled syringe to confirm intratracheal placement. \u25ba Avoid electrocautery to prevent aerosolization of viral particles. \u25ba Stop mechanical ventilation after an exhalation, after placing the guidewire and just prior to tracheal dilation. \u25ba Hold ventilation until intratracheal placement of the tracheostomy tube and inflation of the cuff, if the patient's condition will allow (no critical hypoxemia). \u25ba Resume ventilation through the tracheostomy after cuff inflation. \u25ba Remove endotracheal tube from the mouth, placing it directly into a plastic bag for disposal.",
