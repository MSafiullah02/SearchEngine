            "text": "Heterocyclic composites are an important class of organic compounds possessing broad applications in various fields of science [1\u20137]. One of the most eminent heterocyclic motifs, thiazolidine, is a five-membered heterocycle system having the formula C3H7NS containing one nitrogen and one sulfur atom, and which exhibits notable medicinal and pharmaceutical properties. In the thiazolidine nucleus, a large number of substitutions are possible on 2, 4 and 5 positions responsible for enhancing the compound's pharmaceutical importance. Thiazolidine and its composites are key components of many natural products and drugs (Fig. 1), and are also present in many synthetic compounds such as anticancer [8\u201311], antimicrobial [12\u201314], antitumor [15, 16], antidiabetic [17], antiparasitic [18, 19], anti-inflammatory [20\u201322], antitubercular [23], antifungal [24], antiviral [25, 26], anti-HIV [27\u201329], cytotoxicity [30], antitrypanosomal [31], antinociceptive and anti-hypernociceptive compounds [32]. In addition, the use of thiazolidines as an inhibitor of tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase I [33] and influenza neuraminidase [34], pro-drugs for the treatment of cystinosis [35], radioprotective against \u03b3-irradiation [36] and as S1P1 receptor agonists [37, 38] has also been reported. They are also used in peptide and protein modification [39], protein chemical synthesis [40], as activators to innate immunity [41] and also act as immunostimulating agents [42].",

            "text": "These derivatives are also involved in various syntheses as synthetic precursors, potential biomarkers for oxidative stress and formaldehyde exposure [43], heterogeneous catalysts [44, 45], free radicals, superoxide anion radical and hydroxyl radical scavengers [46\u201348], inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitors [49], to construct non-fullerene small molecules [50] and on and on. Green chemistry was formulated in the 1990s and includes 12 principles. The green processes diminish the adverse effects of any chemical reaction by following certain criteria viz. catalyst- and solvent-free synthesis and designing of biodegradable and less toxic products with high efficiency. In this review article, we have compiled researches which step ahead toward green chemistry. In the past few years, divergent synthetic strategies [51] have been introduced aimed at efficient and green synthesis using inexpensive reactants, nontoxic solvents, reusable catalysts, nanoparticle-catalyzed synthesis and solvent-free synthesis with high yields using different techniques such as microwave irradiation (MWI), sonochemistry, surface chemistry and others (Fig. 2). Multicomponent reactions (MCRs) (Strecker, Ugi, Bucherer-Bergs, Biginelli) are excellent pathways for the synthesis of heterocycles [52] as they have all the features for ideal synthesis like simple procedure for generating complex hybrid molecules in fewer steps which possess excellent pharmaceutical activity with high atom economy and eco-friendliness [53, 54]. The notable features of thiazolidine scaffolds compel us to study the literature and outline the current status of thiazolidine, its derivatives and also their biological significance. Recently, Jain et al. [55] reviewed the biological activity of thiazolidinone derivatives from 2000 to 2011. In 2013, Jain and coauthors [56] reviewed the multifarious applications of various thiazolidine-2,4-dione derivatives. Nanjan et al. [57] reviewed the antidiabetic activity of thiazolidinone. But there is no detailed review of the synthesis and biological activity of thiazolidines to date. So here, we have summarized a literature survey of different strategies developed for the synthesis of thiazolidines and their analogs, highlighting their activity and their use as starting materials in the synthesis of various heterocyclic systems with potent pharmaceutical properties during the period of 2014\u20132019, hoping to inspire new and even more creative approaches for researchers (Fig. 3). We have also included a comparative study of various synthetic protocols of thiazolidine derivatives with their advantages (+) and disadvantages (\u2212) (Figs. 4, 5, 6, 7). In this review, an endeavor has been made to underline the recent issues in thiazolidine synthesis like environmental, health, cost and energy issues. By using truly greener pathways, we can overcome these factors for a promising future of thiazolidine derivatives.",

The authors studied this procedure in different conditions like various solvents (isopropanol, methanol, acetic acid, toluene, ethanol and DMF) and varied catalysts (p-TSA, sulfamic acid, hydrochloric acid and sulfanilic acid). In this synthesis, \u03b2-cyclodextrin-SO3H was the most favorable with water as its heterogeneous biopolymer-based solid acid catalyst and was reusable without any vital changes. A safe and greener reaction pathway, low toxicity, high yield of product and easy isolation method were advantages of this protocol. The reaction mechanism is depicted in Scheme 2. The mechanism shows that \u03b2-cyclodextrin-SO3H might first activate the aldehyde by enhancing the electrophilic character of its carbonyl moiety which formed an imine intermediate and \u03b2-cyclodextrin-SO3H anion, and this anion further increased the nucleophilic character of thioglycolic acid which reacted with the imine intermediate and formed an adduct, which was further activated by \u03b2-cyclodextrin-SO3H anion, followed by ring closure and final dehydration, resulting in formation of novel products.",

A general mechanism for DROC-mediated synthesis explained that initially N-arylsulfonylaziridine, activated by the Lewis acid (BF3\u00b7OEt2) with TBAHS, gave an intermediate which was highly reactive and showed SN2-type ring-opening reaction with isothiocyanates to furnish a new intermediate with an inverted configuration. This intermediate underwent 5-exo-dig cyclization to afford 2-iminothiazolidine (7) derivatives, which have high yields and excellent enantioselectivity (Scheme 4). In this synthetic strategy, different stereoisomers under different conditions gave enantio- and diastereospecific products. Firstly, enantiopure (R)-2-phenyl-N-tosylaziridine (R)-5a reacted with phenyl isothiocyanates 6a, using scandium(III) triflate as a catalyst in dichloromethane at 0 \u00b0C, to form (S,Z)-N,5-diphenyl-3-tosylthiazolidin-2-imine ((S)-7a) single regioisomer (52%) with low enantiomeric excess (34%) (Scheme 3). Various solvents, catalyst and temperatures were applied to obtain the best reaction conditions. When the reaction was catalyzed by BF3\u00b7OEt2 and TBAHS (tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate) at \u221230 \u00b0C, high yields were obtained (97%) with excellent enantiospecificity (98% ee). The authors also studied the effect of different substituents on yield and stereoselectivity. This study continued in substituted (R)-2-phenyl-N-arylsulfonylaziridines and phenyl isothiocyanate under previous reaction conditions and formed corresponding 2-iminothiazolidines with good enantiomeric excess. When 2-aryl-N-tosylaziridines cyclized with phenyl isothiocyanate using BF3.OEt2 and TBAHS in CH2Cl2 at 0 \u00b0C, regioisomers of 2-iminothiazolidines were produced in high yields (up to 99%). With the same previous reaction conditions, except the amount of catalyst, trans-2, 3-disubstituted aziridines gave single diastereomers (de, ee > 99%) related 2-iminothiazolidines in 90% yield (Scheme 4).",

Further Michael addition of 2-(nitromethylene)thiazolidine 16 and the adduct resulted in the formation of an intermediate, followed by imine\u2013enamine tautomerization, then nucleophilic addition of an amino moiety to the carbonyl group, and, finally, intramolecular cyclization produced desired products 20(a\u2013p) in 75\u201394% yields (Scheme 10). The remarkable features of this new protocol were operational simplicity, mild reaction conditions, easily available substrates, easy workup, high yield in short time periods and a highly environmentally benign method.",

The catalyst was reusable for seven progressive cycles. This novel reaction was carried out on different aromatic aldehydes and aniline, and it was concluded that the EWG in aldehydes reacted faster as compared to EDGs. Two mechanisms have been proposed for the reaction. In the first mechanism, aldehyde and amine interacted to form imine intermediate, then a sulfur atom of mercaptoacetic acid attacked the carbon atom of imine which was catalyzed by CoFe2O4@SiO2/PrNH2 NPs followed by intramolecular cyclization to give thiazolidinones (Pathway A). In the second mechanism, initially, formation of amide took place from aldehyde, thioglycolic acid and amine followed by cyclocondensation of a carbonyl group of aldehyde with sulfur and a nitrogen motif catalyzed by the same NPs to give cyclic compounds, thiazolidinones (Pathway B) (Scheme 18).",

Here, [Et3NH][HSO4] is an inexpensive, eco-friendly catalyst, stable in water and air, exhibited both catalytic and medium engineering capability, is recyclable up to five runs without any significant loss of catalytic activity and also eliminated the additional use of the solvent. According to the possible reaction mechanism, initially, ionic liquid protonated the cyanates to furnish an intermediate, which underwent nucleophilic addition with 1,3-diketones and formed a new intermediate, which further reacted with ethylchloroacetate with consequent expulsion of HCl. The nitrogen of the compound attacked the carbonyl group and eliminated ethanol to form a C\u2013N bond and finally formed the products 37 (Scheme 27). The authors applied diverse catalysts like [Et3NH][HSO4], [Me3NH][HSO4], [Et2NH2][H2PO4] and [Me3NH][CH3COO], and various solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), EtOH, DMF, CH3NO2, toluene and [Et3NH][HSO4] in different amounts at varied temperature for optimization of the reaction conditions w.r.t. good yields and time (Table 2). The solvent also played a crucial role in the yields of reaction; i.e. nonpolar solvent (85%) \u02c3 polar-aprotic solvent (55\u201374%) \u02c3 polar-protic solvent (52%). However, the best results were obtained at 120 \u00b0C in 20 mol% of IL as a reaction media under solvent-free conditions. High atom economy, operational simplicity, an environmentally friendly nature, easy catalyst synthesis, low waste material, mild conditions and shorter reaction time are the notable advantages of this procedure.",

Here, aroyl isothiocyanates played a role either as an ambient nucleophile (\u2013SCN or \u2013NCS) or electrophile. When this reaction was accomplished with solvent, the yield was comparatively low. This process was examined with substituted aziridine and aroyl isothiocyanates, and the authors demonstrated that the synthesis was facile when aziridine bearing electron-donating groups and aroyl isothiocyanates having electron-withdrawing substituents were taken. The mechanism of the reaction showed that this methodology involved [3+2] cycloaddition reaction which occurred by the SN2 pathway. This was confirmed by the reaction of optically active aziridine and aryl isothiocyanate, and it gave optically active product. The lone pair on the nitrogen of aziridine made it a nucleophile, and its attack on the sp hybrid carbon of heterocumulene NCS formed a thiourea intermediate, whose sulfur atom attacked the benzylic site of aziridine, and ring opening occurred (Scheme 31).",

According to the reaction mechanism, it was suggested that nano-CdZr4(PO4)6 activated the carbonyl moiety of aldehyde and acid via coordinating with the carbonyl oxygen (Scheme 35). For comparative study, the authors employed diverse solvents, e.g. H2O, EtOH, PhMe, THF and DMF, and catalysts like H2SO4 and nano-SnO/ZrO2/CdZr4(PO4)6. However, PhMe and nano-CdZr4(PO4)6 were proved best as they gave high yields in short reaction time. The authors also studied the reaction under reflux conditions, but it displayed low yields in long reaction time as compared to ultrasonic irradiations. The use of nano-CdZr4(PO4)6 as an efficient, highly active, easily recovered, eco-friendly catalyst with notable reusability without loss of its activity is the superior feature of this method. Simple reaction procedure, easily available reactants, use of sonochemical technique, high yields, synthetic efficiency, easy workup and short reaction time are the additional benefits of this protocol.",

The authors applied different catalysts, solvents and temperature range using various ratios of reactants to optimize reaction parameters. According to the possible reaction mechanism, initially, metal acetylide attacked imine and generated an alkyn-amide nucleophile, which further reacted with isothiocyanate as an electrophile to form an intermediate. This intermediate has two nucleophilic atoms, thus two possibilities occur: nitrogen attack gave S-cyclized product thiazolidine-2-imine; and sulfur attack produced N-cyclized product imidazolidine-2-thione 51. Single-crystal X-ray analysis confirmed the existence of 2-imino thiazolidine.

The 3D structures of both compounds were different, due to presence of diverse substituents at the phenyl ring and co-crystallization with solvent molecules. Compound 72a docked with hydrophobic\u2013hydrophobic interaction, but compound 72b docked with both hydrophobic\u2013hydrophobic and H-bonding interactions.

Both compounds exhibited more antimicrobial activity against standard drugs. Compound 72b gave better activity than 72a against B. subtilis, S. pneumonia and E. coli and also showed high potency against antifungal treatment. The molecular docking study revealed that substitution on phenyl rings plays an important role in the geometry of compounds, which controls its behavior and mode of interaction.

For the study of the 4-hydroxy-thiazolidine-2-thione moiety as a drug, it was divided into two subunits, subunit A (the phenyl group) and subunit B (the pyridin-3-ylmethyl moiety), on the basis of their structure. The modification in subunit A was carried out by the reaction of substituted sulfonyl chlorides and 4-aminoacetophenone, and they formed intermediates which further reacted with phenyltrimethylammonium tribromide, pyridin-3-ylmethenamine and carbon disulfide (Scheme 74). This compound was more potent as pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2) activators. The SARs study using fluorescent PK-LDH coupled assay showed that the electronic and steric effect of substituents at the benzene ring affected activation activity of PKM2. Compounds 91t and 91y (AC50 value 0.52 \u00b5M, 0.74 \u00b5M respectively) showed higher potency than other derivatives (AC50 = 2.96 \u00b5M). The EWG (91h\u201391m), multi-substituents (91d and 91e) and large groups which showed steric hindrance (91n\u201391p) on the benzene ring deactivated PKM2, and when the ring was substituted with \u2013CH3 and \u2013OCH3 groups at the meta and para positions, the activity was decreased, whereas a methyl group at the ortho position at nanomolar concentration increased the activity. The PKM2 activity was affected when the benzene ring was replaced with different rings (91q, 91r, 91z), replacement of the N-containing bicyclic ring with other rings, and length of carbon linker between the 4-hydroxy-thiazolidine-2-thione framework and the pyridine framework due to hydrogen bonding interaction with PKM2.

The in vitro antiproliferative activity was evaluated in two cancer cell lines (MV4-11 and K562) against selected inhibitors. They used mainly two approaches; Firstly, they synthesized fused tricyclic series through hydrolysis followed by conjugate addition, which showed significant improvement in both solubility and metabolic stability. Another approach showed improvement in metabolic activity by addition of pseudothiohydantoin in place of the rhodanine head group. A compound of series 96 was formed by Knoevenagel condensation of carbonyl compounds and rhodanine using piperidine in EtOH (Scheme 76). The other derivatives were synthesized by Suzuki\u2013Miyaura coupling, using RB(OH)2 and Pd(PPh3)4 in Na2CO3, which further underwent Knoevenagel condensation with rhodanine using piperidine as catalyst to obtain tricyclic compounds. The compounds were divided into 11 classes on the basis of their structure. These series possessed better selectivity for pan-PIM kinases than other kinases. All tested compounds displayed good activity, and derivative 98b exhibited high activity against the K562 cell line, with an IC50 value of 0.75lM. Compound 97a has a phenyl group, and displayed a 90-fold increase in activity, with an IC50 value of 6.7 \u00b1 3.1 nM, and the in silico study revealed that their rhodanine head group showed H-bonding interaction with water which was connected with the Lys67 residue, and this interaction was found to be sandwich-like interaction between the products and the lipophilic area of the PIM binding pocket.

The final compounds were synthesized in two steps: initially, substituted carbonyl compounds were refluxed with thiosemicarbazide and HCl in EtOH, and Schiff bases were formed, which further reacted with chloroacetic acid and CH3COONa using glacial AcOH, to furnish 4-thiazolidinone derivatives 131(a\u2013t) (Scheme 98). All synthesized molecules gave moderate to excellent inhibition, with IC50 values in the range of 1.73\u201369.65 as compared to standard thiourea. Among all newly synthesized compounds, 131(c, f, h, j, o, p, q, s and t) showed excellent inhibition activity with IC50 values of 9.34 \u00b1 0.02, 14.62 \u00b1 0.03, 8.43 \u00b1 0.01, 7.3 \u00b1 0.04, 2.31 \u00b1 0.002, 5.75 \u00b1 0.003, 8.81 \u00b1 0.005 and 1.73 \u00b1 0.001, respectively. The pharmacological activity of compounds was affected by the steric effect, different substituents and their positions (Table 7).",

The concentration of inhibitor and temperature affected their efficiency of reaction: with increase in concentration, efficiency increased, but increased temperature decreased their efficiency. The weight loss measurement revealed that MBTMT (97.5%) showed higher efficiency than CBTMT (95.8%) at 303 K. This inhibition process was based mainly on adsorption, with both inhibitors obeying the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, and it was concluded that their inhibition depended on the covered surface area and number of active sites, i.e. N and S atoms. The higher value of \u00b5 (dipole moment) and lower value of \u0394E (energy gap) enhanced compound inhibition efficiency.",

            "text": "Green chemistry is a fascinating area in the field of sustainable synthesis. Green solvents and catalysts play a significant role in synthetic organic chemistry. Today\u2019s chemistry researchers need to explore new avenues of synthetic methodologies and biological applications of heterocyclic scaffolds. Though various developments have occurred in the synthetic and biological study of thiazolidine and its derivatives, there is a need for further development of the chemistry to enhance discoveries in this field. During the extensive review of the literature review on thiazolidine and its derivatives, several strengths and weaknesses were noted. For example, solvents used in the process of synthesis are hazardous to the environment, and therefore solvent-free synthesis has proven to be a boon for the environment and society, as it reduces waste and energy consumption. Solvents also serve as a heat transfer medium, and thus detailed study of their thermodynamics is required. A major drawback regarding the purification procedures (column chromatography) is that they require a large amount of solvents for purification, so extensive research is needed to avoid flaws. Ionic liquids are used as green solvents due to their recyclability, low volatility and so forth, but their high cost, safety issues and lack of generalization limit their use. In the recent scenario, crucial improvements in issues such as energy efficiency, by-product generation, impurity removal procedures, release of toxic products, whole life-cycle study and following common basic procedures with some modifications are necessary in the context of cost, population, environment, energy, health and resources. For industrial-level applications, synthesis methods could fulfill parameters including atom economy, environmental factor (e-factor), ecoscale, process profile, life-cycle analysis, environmental quotient and effective mass yield. Regarding pharmacological significance, thiazolidine-containing drugs show a variety of biological activity due to interactions such as hydrogen bonding, ion\u2013dipole interaction, hydrophobic action, \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interaction, Van der Waal forces and bonding with various enzymes and pharmacophores.",

Therefore, critical study is needed with special emphasis on SAR and the role of PPARs in molecular mechanisms and biological activity. A better understanding of the structure of ligands and receptors and their interaction needs to be achieved. Keeping all these facts in view, thiazolidine motifs will prove to be valuable candidates for designing more effective and potent drugs by reducing their side effects. This review article includes a detailed study of thiazolidine and its derivatives, and their varied synthesis and pharmaceutical applications, and will pave a better pathway for future directions and challenges.",

The application of MW-, nanoparticle- and ionic liquid-mediated synthesis in such processes has opened a new avenue for thiazolidine formation. It is likely that in the future, many more powerful and benign methodologies will emerge in this field. Furthermore, attention should be paid to modification and substitution in thiazolidine nuclei and also toward SAR and docking studies for improving the design strategies for drug targets. On a global scale, the opportunity in the field of thiazolidine is broad for synthetic and medical discovery, and this knowledge has been applied in the synthesis of multi-target hybrid drugs, which control diseases such as diabetes, cancer, multiple sclerosis and lupus. We trust that this review will serve as an update for researchers focused on the synthesis of thiazolidine derivatives and will encourage further growth in this field.",
