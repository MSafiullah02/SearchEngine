HRSV is considered the major pathogen causing respiratory disease in infants and neonates worldwide, which may result in serious complications such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis (Holberg et al., 1991). This virus is responsible for 38% of the lower respiratory tract infections in infants up to 1 year of age. Half of these infants have re-infections after 1 year (Schmidt et al., 2004). HRSV is also a significant cause of respiratory disease in the elderly (Han et al., 1999), immune-compromised patients, such as bone marrow transplant patients (Hall et al., 1986), and is related to the development of asthma in childhood (Lemanske, 2004).",

The nucleoprotein or N protein associates with the viral RNA, forming a helical structure and guaranteeing resistance to RNases (Meric et al., 1994). The phosphoprotein or P protein has two known functions: it interacts with the N protein, giving specificity for viral RNA encapsidation (Curran et al., 1995, Spehner et al., 1997); and interacts with the L protein (the major unit of the virus replication complex), conferring stability and the correct placement in the ribonucleo-complex for RNA synthesis (Bowman et al., 1999, Horikami et al., 1992). The genome encodes also three transmembrane surface proteins (F, G, SH), a matrix protein (M), a nucleocapsid-associated protein (M2-1), an M2-2 protein (the second product of the M2 gene) and two nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2) (Collins et al., 2001).",

However, a recent study showed that the RNA polymerase II dependent expression of HRSV F protein can only be achieved at high levels with the optimization of the gene, which involves the elimination of premature polyadenylation sites (Ternette et al., 2007a). In a further study, the same group used the optimized F gene to test a DNA vaccine in mice, showing induction of antibodies and protection against HRSV (Ternette et al., 2007b). In another recent study, DNA vaccines containing the optimized BRSV N or F genes were used to induce robust cell-mediated immunity and protection of calves against the BRSV challenge (Boxus et al., 2007).",

After transfection of human cells, protein expression was monitored by Western blot and immunofluorescence assays for optimized and non-optimized genes. In both experiments, neither the N protein nor the P protein could be detected for plasmids containing the natural sequence of the genes. However, robust expression of both proteins was obtained after optimization. The study shows that these proteins are expressed in different intracellular localizations compared with HRSV infected cells. Immunization tests were performed and only the optimized genes were able to generate humoral immunity. The positive effect of HRSV N and P gene optimization is described as an approach that might be considered for the development of a DNA vaccine against HRSV.",

Ternette et al., 2007a, Ternette et al., 2007b showed that HRSV genes have several differences when compared with cellular genes. The evolution in the cytoplasmic environment causes the accumulation of numerous modifications in HRSV genes, which would be negatively selected if these genes were transcribed in the cell nucleus. The accumulation of premature polyadenylation sites for example, which hinder the synthesis of full mRNA, was shown to be a critical feature. As shown in this report, the premature poliadenilation sites of the N and P genes were reduced to zero after the optimization process and their CAI values were improved to approximately 0.9.",

The nuclear localization was confirmed by the separation of nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extracts (Fig. 3). It is possible that the N protein may be interacting with cellular RNAs that are presented in the nucleus. The perinuclear localization can be explained by the interaction of the N protein with RNAs that are being exported from the nucleus, or that are being translated at the rough endoplasmic reticulum (Jansen, 2001). It has been shown that the coronavirus N protein contains a nucleolar localization domain and that it can localize to the nucleus and affect cell division (Wurm et al., 2001). The N protein HRSV sequence in the PredictNLS (http://cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/predictNLS/) server was tested, but no nuclear localization sequence was found.",

The antibody levels were further increased with aluminum phosphate adjuvant (Fig. 5). It is known that cellular immunity against HRSV avoids the vaccine-enhanced disease observed in the formalin-inactivated vaccine (Becker, 2006, Olson and Varga, 2007) and, since N and P proteins are nucleocapsid proteins, they might have important roles in generating such cellular immunity. It was recently demonstrated that the HRSV N protein has important cellular epitopes (Terrosi et al., 2007). The use of specific peptides, representative of T cell epitopes for N and P proteins, should be considered in further cellular immunity studies using the N and P optimized genes.",

The data presented indicate that DNA vaccines containing the optimized N and P genes may generate protective immunity against HRSV and to avoid the vaccine-enhanced disease inflammatory effects.",
