Due to the high likelihood of virus transmission via large droplets 39 and fomites, COVID-19 infection spread rapidly around the planet (2). Preventive public health 40 measures have been implemented to fight the pandemic. Although the strategies applied 41 internationally are similar, the timeliness, scale, and assertiveness of implementation regimes have 42 varied considerably (3). 43 In Vietnam, the first person with a COVID-19 infection was detected on January 23 rd and 44 as of May 5 th , 2020, Vietnam had totaled 271 confirmed cases with zero deaths (4). Currently 45 Vietnam is among the countries with the lowest number of reported cases, which is remarkable 46 given its population size (approx. 95 million people) and proximity to the epicenter. From the start 47 of the outbreak the government of Vietnam implemented intensive control in the northern Vinh 48 Phuc province (considered to be the local focus of the disease) using a strategy of rapid testing for 49 early detection of sources of infection, assertive contact tracing, timely isolation and free clinical 50 care for people with the infection. Community preventive efforts were implemented early and have 51 been pervasive throughout the country. The government supported social distancing, self-isolation 52 of vulnerable people, mandatory isolation of symptomatic people and those who test positive, focal 53 environmental sanitization, frequent hand washing and wearing of face masks in all public spaces. 54 By February 25 th , one month after the first case was recorded, all patients had successfully 55 recovered and had been discharged from hospitals. After more than 20 days with no new case 56 reported, the 17 th positive case of COVID-19 was confirmed on March 6 th .

Indeed, respondents were mainly people from medium to 261 high social strata, since poor and vulnerable populations in Vietnam may have limited internet 262 access. The snowball sampling method and recruitment over just one week possibly explains the 263 high proportion of health professionals and health science students. Random sampling of the 264 population is necessary. Second, it is not possible to verify the veracity of responses provided via 265 a web-based questionnaire. Third, the cross-sectional study design provided only a snapshot of 266 preventive behaviour over one week. It will be important to monitor adherence to official 267 recommendations over time as societies adapt to changing conditions throughout the unpredictable 268 course of this pandemic. 269 Conclusion 270 The study provides insight into compliance with the social distancing and other risk 271 mitigation measures implemented in Vietnam in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, 272 adherence to government instructions was high and most likely played a role in rapidly controlling 273 the epidemic in Vietnam and limiting its public health impact.

According to Berlin-based Dalia Research, 62% of respondents in Vietnam believe the government is doing the \"right amount\" in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (17); it is therefore not surprising that Vietnam has been internationally recognized for their success in controlling COVID-19 (18).
