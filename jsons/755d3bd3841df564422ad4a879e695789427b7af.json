Yet the industrial revolution transformed not just how firms made things, but the fundamental approach to value creation in industrial economies. To date, big data has not achieved this distinction. Instead, today's successful big data business models largely use data to scale old modes of value creation, rather than invent new ones altogether. Moreover, today's big data cannot deliver the promised revolution. In this way, today's big data landscape resembles the early phases of the first industrial revolution, rather than the culmination of the second a century later. Realizing the second big data revolution will require fundamentally different kinds of data, different innovations, and different business models than those seen to date. That fact has profound consequences for the kinds of investments and innovations firms must seek, and the economic, political, and social consequences that those innovations portend.",

Small samples were unreliable; large samples were expensive; samples might not be representative, despite researchers' best efforts; tracking the same sample over many years required organizations and budgets that few organizations outside governments could justify. None of this, moreover, was very scalable: researchers needed a new sample for every question, or had to divine in advance a battery of questions and hope that this proved adequate. No wonder social research proceeded so slowly. Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger and Cukier (2013) argue that big data will eliminate these problems. Instead of having to rely on samples, online data, they claim, allows us to measure the universe of online behavior, where N (the number of people in the sample) is basically all (the entire population of people we care about). Hence we no longer need worry, they claim, about the problems that have plagued researchers in the past. When N = all, large samples are cheap and representative, new data on individuals arrives constantly, monitoring data over time poses no added difficulty, and cheap storage permits us to ask new questions of the same data again and again. With this new database of what people are saying or buying, where they go and when, how their social networks change and evolve, and myriad other factors, the prior restrictions borne of the cost and complexity of sampling will melt away.",

Today, it's the punchline to a joke. The rate of change in online commerce, social media, search, and other services undermines any claim that we can actually know that our N = all sample that works today will work tomorrow. Instead, we only know about new developments-and the data and populations they cover-well after they have already become big. Hence our N = all sample is persistently biased in favor of the old.

Danah Boyd's work (Boyd and Marwick 2011) has shown that teenagers cultivate online identities very different from their offline selves-whether for creative, privacy, or other reasons. In others, it may mean that people are more vitriolic, or take more extreme positions. Online political discussions-another favorite subject of big data enthusiasts-suffer from levels of vitriol and partisanship far beyond anything seen offline (Conover et al. 2011) . Of course, online and offline identity aren't entirely separate. That would invite suggestions of schizophrenia among internet users.

Historically, the CDC had monitored US flu infection patterns through a network of doctors that tracked and reported Binfluenza-like illness^in their clinics and hospitals. But doctors' reports took up to 2 weeks to reach the CDC-a long time in a world confronting SARS or avian flu. Developing countries with weaker public health capabilities faced even greater challenges. Google hypothesized that, when individuals or their family members got the flu, they went looking on the internet-via Google, of course-for medical advice. In a highly cited paper, Ginsberg et al.

Machine translation provides a very pertinent example: human speech and writing varies enormously within one language, let alone two. Faced with the choice between better algorithms for understanding human language, and more data to quantify the variance in language, more data appears to work better. But for other applications, the Bbigness^of data may not matter at all. If I want to know who will win an election, polling a thousand people might be enough. Relying on the aggregated voices of a nation's Twitter users, in contrast, will probably fail (Gayo-Avello et al. 2011; Gayo-Avello 2012; Huberty 2013) . Not only are we not, as section 2 discussed, in the N = all world that infatuated Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger and Cukier (2013); but for most problems we likely don't care to be. Having the right data-and consequently identifying the right question to ask beforehand-is far more important than having a lot of data of limited relevance to the answers we seek.",

The world of their passing had cars and airplanes, electric light and refrigerators, and telephones, radio, and motion pictures.

These changes were expensive, complicated, and slow-so slow that John Stuart Mill despaired, as late as 1871, of human progress.

These and other technologies are deeply embedded in, and reliant on, data generated from and around realworld phenomena. None rely on Bdigital exhaust^. They do not create value by parsing customer data or optimizing ad click-through rates (though presumably they could). They are not the product of a relatively few, straightforward (if ultimately quite useful) insights. Instead, IBM, Google, and Nest have dedicated substantial resources to studying natural language processing, large-scale machine learning, knowledge extraction, and other problems. The resulting products represent an industrial synthesis of a series of complex innovations, linking machine intelligence, real-time sensing, and industrial design. These products are thus much closer to what big data's proponents have promised-but their methods are a world away from the easy hype about mass-manufactured insights from the free raw material of digital exhaust.",

The big gains from big data will require a transformation of organizational, technological, and economic operations on par with that of the second industrial revolution. Then, as now, firms had to invest heavily in industrial research and development to build the foundations of entirely new forms of value creation. Those foundations permitted entirely new business models, in contrast to the marginal changes of the first industrial revolution.

Innovation will rely less on small entrepreneurs, who lack the funds and scale for systems-level innovation. Where entrepreneurs do remain, they will play far more niche roles. As Rao (2012) has argued, startups will increasingly become outsourced R&D, whose innovations are acquired to become features of existing products rather than standalone products themselves. The success of systems-level innovation will threaten a range of current jobs-white collar and service sector as well as blue collar and manufacturing-as expanding algorithmic capacity widens the scope of digitizeable tasks. But unlike past revolutions, that expanding capacity also begs the question of where this revolution will find new forms of employment insulated from these technological forces; and if it does not, how we manage the social instability that will surely follow. With luck, we will resist the temptation to use those same algorithmic tools for social control. But human history on that point is not encouraging.",
