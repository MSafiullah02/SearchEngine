We reevaluated 81 children who had been prospectively followed up since hospitalization for wheezing at less than 2 years of age. The baseline data on characteristics of the children, family-related factors, and viral causes of wheezing were collected on entry into the study. At the median age of 12.3 years, current symptoms suggestive of asthma and allergy were recorded. As part of the clinical examination, an outdoor exercise challenge test and skin prick tests to common inhalant allergens were performed. Asthma, as indicated by current inhaled anti-inflammatory medication or repeated wheezing and positive result in the challenge test, was present in 32 (40%) children, and 90% of them were sensitized to at least one allergen. Early asthma-predictive factors were atopic dermatitis (odds ratio (OR), 3.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-10.1) and the presence of specific IgE to inhalant allergens (OR, 11.3; 95% CI, 1.9-67.6). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) identification during wheezing in infancy was relatively rare (20%) among later asthmatics compared with other or no viral identification (52%) or rhinovirus identification (58%). Since the prevalence of childhood asthma in our area is 4.0-5.0%, we conclude that the increased risk of asthma persists until the teenage years after hospitalization for wheezing in infancy. The risk was about 5-fold after respiratory syncytial virus-induced wheezing, and more than 10-fold after rhinovirus-induced wheezing in the present study.

The risk of asthma after hospitalization for severe wheezing in infancy has varied from 28-39% at ages 10-13 years. 4, 9, 10 The aim of the present prospective follow-up study was to evaluate the occurrence of asthma and atopy at ages 11-13 years, 10-12 years after early childhood wheezing treated in hospital. Special attention was paid to the early host-and virus-specific factors, which at this critical age may predict the development of asthma or persistence of the disease.",

Only diagnoses made by a physician were accepted. Additional information on maternal smoking during pregnancy, and passive smoking and pet contacts at home or at daycare, was recorded. 1 Viral infections were studied by antigen detection in the nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) taken at entry and by antibody measurements in paired sera. The adeno group, influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1, 2, and 3, and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) were assayed. 1 In 2000, 81 frozen good-quality NPA samples, taken on admission in 1992-1993, were available for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection of rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, and coronaviruses. 11 In 2002, an adequate NPA sample was available for RSV PCR in 61 cases. 12 During the primary hospitalization, a venous blood sample was obtained to determine blood eosinophils, serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and total immunoglobulin E (IgE). The cutoff level was 0.44 cells \u00c2 10 9 /l for blood eosinophils, 13 a value of 16 mg/l for serum ECP, 14 and a value of 60 kU/l (144 mg/l) for total serum IgE. 15 In 2000, allergen-specific IgE antibodies (Phadiatop Combi 1 ) were determined in frozen serum samples, which had been obtained at enrollment in 1992-1993, by the fluoroenzyme-immunometric assay (FEIA) Uni-CAP TM (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). 16 The presence of IgE antibodies in the mixtures of inhalant and food allergens was screened by the detection limit (!0.35 kU/l), and if positive, allergen-specific IgE antibodies were measured by the same limit. The Phadiatop Combi 1 panel for food allergens includes egg white, cow's milk, fish, wheat, peanut, and soy bean, and for inhalant allergens, timothy grass, birch and mugwort pollens, cat, dog, and horse danders, house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, and spores of the mold Cladosporium herbarum.",

Forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV 1 ) was the parameter applied in challenge tests. First, the children were carefully instructed on how to perform the test. Thereafter, the measurements were repeated three times, and accepted if the FEV 1 variation was less than 5% and the graphic curves were appropriate and equal in shape. The highest FEV 1 value was used in later comparisons. The baseline pulmonary testing was followed by an exercise that consisted of free running outdoors for 8 min at a heart rate of 80% or more of the predicted maximum. Heart rate was monitored by telemetry (Polar Sport Tester, Polar Elektro Ltd., Kempele, Finland) at 1-min intervals. The FVS was measured, and lungs were auscultated 5, 10, and 15 min after exercise. FEV 1 changes were calculated as follows: ((pre-exercise FEV 1 \u00c0postexercise FEV 1 )/ pre-exercise FEV 1 ) \u00c2 100%. The exercise challenge test was regarded as positive if there was a 10% or greater fall in FEV 1 values 5, 10, or 15 min after the test. 18 One of the authors (M.K.H.) was responsible for both the performance of lung function and exercise challenge tests and the interpretation of results.",

            "text": "Recent observations confirmed that the years before puberty are critical for the persistence of asthma. 20 In previous studies, children with mild bronchiolitis in infancy, not requiring hospitalization, were at risk for asthma until ages 6-8 years, but not any more at ages 11-13 years, 8, 21 whereas severe bronchiolitis, requiring hospitalization, predicted asthma at least until ages 10-13 years. 4, 9, 10 We prospectively followed up a group of children with wheezing requiring hospitalization in infancy, and over half of them had outgrown the symptoms related to wheezing before school age. 3 In the present study, we reexamined the children at ages 11-13 years, which seems to be a critical age for the persistence of asthma, 8 and there were three main results. First, at a median age of 12.3 years, asthma was still common among children hospitalized for wheezing in infancy, now present in 40%. This figure is in line with the previously reported 28-39% asthma prevalences at the same age in children hospitalized for wheezing in infancy. 4, 9, 10 Second, rhinovirus as a causative agent of the index episode of wheezing in infancy was common (58%), but RSV was rare (20%), in those children considered asthmatics in this study. The results confirm that the outcome after bronchiolitis is dependent on its viral etiology, as observed in this same cohort at early school age. 11 Third, atopic dermatitis and sensitization to inhalant allergens on study entry predicted asthma 10 years later. This is in accordance with the commonly accepted view that atopy has a very central role in the development of asthma. 2, 3, 5, 6 During the follow-up, we evaluated, by comparable criteria, the occurrence of asthma on average 6 years 3 and in the present study 11 years after wheezing in infancy. The occurrence of asthma was similar (40%) in both studies. Asthma was stable in two thirds of the cases, and in one third, both remissions and relapses were seen. Thus, the risk of asthma after early childhood wheezing persists through childhood until the teenage years, though some children are nonsymptomatic for long periods. This is in accordance with previous follow-up studies on severe bronchiolitis in infancy and asthma in the teen years. 4, 9, 10 According to Sigurs et al., the asthma rate after early RSV bronchiolitis increased from 23% to 28% at the corresponding ages 7 and 13 years. 4, 22 In Noble et al., in contrast, the prevalence of wheezing fell from 43% at age 5 years, to 34% at age 10 years, in children with bronchiolitis in infancy. 9 A similar decreasing trend was also seen in studies by Wennergren et al.: the asthma 16 31 1 ORs and 95% CIs between asthmatics and nonasthmatics were determined by chi-square test. 2 ORs and 95% CIs between asthmatics and nonasthmatics were determined by logistic regression adjusted for sex, age, passive smoking during infancy, and atopic dermatitis on study entry. 3 RSV as single viral finding or in combination with other viruses. 4 RSV not identified. 5 Rhinovirus as only identified virus. 6 Rhinovirus in combination with other viruses, other viruses, or no viral identifications.",

            "text": "In the previous follow-ups until age 10 years or more, only a few or no infantile risk factors were evaluated in regard to asthma after bronchiolitis. 4, 9, 10 Wennergren et al. 23 reported that 18% of wheezing infants had atopic dermatitis and 14% had elevated serum IgE by using a population-based limit of mean \u00fe 2 SD, as in our present study, but neither finding was predictive for asthma at age 10 years. 10 Heymann et al. reported similar figures, i.e., 18% for atopic dermatitis and 15% for serum IgE >64 kU/l, in wheezing children under 3 years old. 7 The figures were slightly higher in the present study: 20% for atopic dermatitis, and 28% for serum IgE >60 kU/l. The differences in total IgE results raise the question that in our study, compared with other hospital-based studies, atopic children may have been overrepresented. Unfortunately, none of the earlier studies evaluated allergen-specific IgE in children younger than 2 years. The high figures in our study, 16% for inhalation allergens and 43% for food allergens, were comparable with those of 25% and 23% in the study of Sigurs et al. at ages 2.5-3.5 years. 25 In that study, children were tested 2.5 years after RSV bronchiolitis, and a positive family history of atopy further increased the risk of sensitization. 25 In both studies, the detection limit of the test (0.35 kU/l) was used, due to a lack of population-based references or clinically established diagnostic limits. In our study, sensitization to inhalation allergens, measured at admission, was seen only in children over 12 months old. These children, compared to children under 12 months old, reacted more beneficially to early anti-inflammatory treatment, 1 and were at greater risk for later asthma. 1, 3 In this subgroup, early wheezing was evidently the first sign of asthma.",

In contrast, no association or tendency was seen for paternal asthma or maternal or paternal atopy. The statistically negative result for maternal asthma was probably due to insufficient power of the study, since the association was significant in the analyses of questionnaire data. Atopy, in contrast, was common in both mothers and fathers, allowing reliable statistical conclusions. Childhood exposure to tobacco smoke is relatively low in Finland; the reported figures vary between 6-13%. 29 Thus, passive smoking was surprisingly common in this study group. Over 40% of the children were exposed to tobacco smoke during infancy, and over 20% during pregnancy. The risk of asthma was increased, compared with nonexposed children, 1.4-2.0-fold, but the difference was not statistically significant. This negative result carries a potential risk of being biased, since smoking was rare in high-risk families; only 3 parents with asthma smoked at the time of study entry.",

            "text": "Earlier studies on the outcome after bronchiolitis stressed the role of RSV in the pathogenesis of asthma. 4, 22 In a recent case-control study, RSV was the predominant virus during winter, and rhinovirus during spring and summer, in children under 3 years old hospitalized for wheezing. 7 Rhinoviruses were found in children at all ages, including even infants under 6 months old. The authors correlated viral and serum IgE data and concluded that allergic sensitization seems to be a predisposing risk factor for an augmented response to acute infections, with rhinovirus leading to wheezing. 7 However, no follow-up data were available. According to the birth cohort data from Tucson, the risk of wheezing after RSV lower respiratory tract infection decreases gradually with age and growth of the child, and finally becomes insignificant by age 13 years. 8 In that study, no data on rhinoviruses were available. In the present study, rhinoviruses were associated with the development of asthma at early school age, but RSVs, in contrast, were associated with a more favorable outcome. 11 Now, at ages 11-13 years, early RSV-induced wheezing was still associated with a relatively favorable outcome. The effect of early rhinovirus infection was the opposite, but the risk, probably due to many confounding factors the children faced at school age, was not significant anymore. Therefore, rather than being an independent risk factor for asthma, rhinovirusinduced wheezing could serve as a marker in infants, revealing those who are prone to wheeze due to either ongoing airway inflammation or even early structural changes in the airway wall. 30 The lack of a simple, widely accepted definition of asthma has hampered the study of childhood asthma. In the present study, the applied asthma criteria were strict; children had to be on maintenance medication for asthma, or had to have repeated subjective symptoms and a positive result in the exercise challenge test as an objective criterion. The exercise challenge test has been specific but not very sensitive for the diagnosis of asthma, 18 and 10-15% falls in FEV 1 were used as cutoff points. 18 We chose, in order to improve the sensitivity of the test, the 10% limit for the present study. Our decision that all 29 children with inhaled anti-inflammatory medication for asthma be registered current asthmatics may have biased the results. However, 75% of them had either repeated episodes of wheezing, prolonged cough, or a positive result in the exercise challenge test. The exclusion of 7 children with no symptoms from the analyses did not change the main results. Likewise, sensitivity analyses, by moving them into the nonasthma group, gave similar main results as with the primary analyses.",

The main shortcoming of the study was the absence of a control group. However, the prevalence of childhood asthma at ages 7-13 years has been carefully studied in our area, and in this population study, the criteria for asthma were comparable to the criteria applied in the present study. 19 The prevalence of asthma at school age is 4.0-5.0% in our area. In the present study, the risk was about 5-fold after RSV-induced wheezing. The respective risk was rather similar, 6-8-fold after RSV bronchiolitis, compared with controls in the study of Sigurs et al. 4 However, the asthma risk was more than 10-fold after rhinovirus-induced wheezing in the present study. Since the study group was highly selected, i.e., children hospitalized for wheezing in infancy, our results reflect only the outcome after the severe clinical form of bronchiolitis or early wheezing.",

Infants with early atopy and wheezing induced by viruses other than RSV carry the highest risk for chronic asthma. At this young age, atopy is often silent, with a later onset of clinical symptoms. Our result, that the presence of specific IgE antibodies to inhaled allergens in infancy predicted asthma in teenage years, confirms the validity of the algorithms applied in recent studies, including early sensitization to aeroallergens as a major risk factor for asthma. 31 Thus, laboratory tests are indicated to reveal silent atopy in wheezing infants, at least in severe cases requiring hospitalization, and if clinical or laboratory findings of atopy are present, a follow-up, lasting until school age or even longer, should be considered.",
