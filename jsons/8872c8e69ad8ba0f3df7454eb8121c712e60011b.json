Lesions consisting of perivascular cuffing of mononuclear cells, focal gliosis, neuronal necrosis and neuronophagia were observed in the brainstem, cerebellum and spinal cord. Non-suppurative ganglionitis in the spinal ganglion and neuritis in the spinal root were also observed. Regardless of the route of inoculation, all pigs infected experimentally with PTV showed a similar distribution of CNS lesions. Histological lesions in the CNS caused by oral or intranasal inoculation of the virus were mild compared with those induced by intravenous infection. Immunohistochemically, the distribution of PTV antigens corresponded closely with the distribution of brain lesions. PTV particles were detected via electron microscopy in the cytoplasm of nerve cells and the endothelial cells of blood vessels in the spinal cord of inoculated pigs. Polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated the presence of PTV RNA in the CNS, tonsils and large intestines of 21 of the 22 pigs inoculated. Direct CNS invasion via the blood vessels appears to be a major route of infection for PTV. The gnotobiotic pig provides a useful model for further study of PTV pathogenesis.",

The disease is considered to be of socioeconomic importance (Knowles, 2008) . Originally called Teschen disease, this swine disease was recognized as a particularly virulent, highly fatal, non-suppurative form of encephalomyelitis (Trefny, 1930) . A milder form of the disease with almost no mortality was identified in Wales and named Talfan disease, while in Denmark, the disease is known as poliomyelitis suum (Knowles, 2008) . Other pathogenic PTV strains were subsequently also defined as causal agents of polioencephalomyelitis (Knowles, 2008) . Infection with PTV is most often asymptomatic and PTV is still frequently isolated from the faeces, tonsils and other non-neural organs of apparently unaffected pigs (La Rosa et al., 2007) . However, PTV has also been isolated from pigs displaying a wide variety of clinical signs (Knowles, 2006) , and no study has yet clarified how PTV infection leads to lesions in pigs.",

Viraemia follows regularly in infections with virulent PTV serotype 1 (PTV-1) strains, resulting in infection of the central nervous system (CNS) . However, the detailed mechanisms by which this infection leads to the development of encephalitis are still unclear. For example, while CNS disorders could not be induced in specific pathogen free (SPF) pigs by either intraoral or intranasal inoculation of the PTV Toyama 2002 strain, intravenous inoculation proved successful, resulting in CNS disorders characterized by non-suppurative encephalomyelitis with neurological signs (Yamada et al., 2009a) . However, the resulting histological lesions were much milder than those in pigs infected naturally. Conversely, a hysterectomy study has shown that CNS disorders can indeed be induced via intranasal or oral inoculation, provided the inoculum comprises the Talfan or Konratice strains of the Teschen virus in gnotobiotic pigs (Edington et al., 1972) . The aim of the present study was to clarify how PTV infection leads to lesions in pigs.",

PTV-1 infection was confirmed by the virus neutralization test in all inoculated pigs and infection in the CNS was further confirmed via detection of PTV RNA using RTnested PCR in all pigs inoculated with PTV except for animal 14. Histological lesions in the CNS induced by oral or intranasal inoculation were mild compared with those in pigs inoculated intravenously. Oral and intranasal inoculations led to neurological signs of infection at 13 to 15 dpi. These signs were not progressive and disappeared within 3 or 4 days. There was a decreasing severity and range of histological lesions in the CNS at 20 and 28 dpi, presumably because of the increased serum antibody titre. In contrast, pigs inoculated intravenously showed a progressive neurological disorder and severe histological CNS lesions at 20 dpi despite an increase in serum antibody titre, possibly due to the host defence mechanism (i.e. the serum antibody titre) being too slow to prevent CNS lesions caused by PTV on induction of severe viraemia. The above findings underscore the potential importance of development of viraemia in the passage of the PTV to the CNS for neural infection in pigs. PCR analysis showed that PTV RNA was detected for shorter periods in the liver of pigs inoculated orally or intranasally than intravenously, suggesting that the infection route may affect how the serum antibody titre initiates host defence on primary infection of PTV and development of viraemia.",

These results suggest that the PTV Toyama 2002 strain may initially invade the endothelial cells of blood vessels in the CNS due to viraemia. In the CNS, vascular endothelial cells organize the bloodebrain barrier (BBB), which is sealed together at its edges by tight junctions to block viral infection of the CNS and prevent the free transport of pathogens between the blood stream and parenchyma of the CNS (Spindler and Hsu, 2012) . PTV may pass though the BBB, however, by infecting endothelial cells. The Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) reportedly enters the CNS via a haematogenous route (Joo and Chu, 1999) and may also enter the brain via the olfactory pathway based on the distribution of lesions and viral antigens following intranasal and intravenous inoculations (Yamada et al., 2009b) . Some viruses, such as Aujeszky's disease herpesvirus (ADV) (Narita et al., 1991) and highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus (Yamada et al., 2012) , also show multiple routes of invasion into the CNS. However, our present findings indicate that PTV does not enter the brain via the olfactory pathway, since the distribution of the lesions and viral antigen did not differ between pigs inoculated intranasally and intravenously.",

We previously described that the earliest lesions in the CNS of piglets infected with the PTV Toyama 2002 strain occur in the spinal ganglion and spinal cord and speculated that the initial infection of the spinal ganglion may reflect the absence of a BBB at this location, thereby allowing the PTV to spread to the spinal cord by passing through the nerve fibres of the dorsal root of the ganglion via retrograde axonal transport (Yamada et al., 2009a) . Similarly, the poliovirus (Ohka et al., 1998 (Ohka et al., , 2004 Mueller et al., 2005) and enterovirus 71 (Chen et al., 2007) , which like PTV are a members of the Picornaviridae family, have been reported to enter the CNS from the blood across the BBB or be transmitted to the CNS through peripheral nerves via retrograde axonal transport. Immunohistochemical findings in the present work indicated that PTV enters the CNS by similar retrograde axonal transport or via haematogenous spread. However, we did not detect virus particles in the axons, arguing against retrograde axonal transport of PTV. Further studies are necessary to clarify the pathogenesis of the PTV Toyama 2002 strain and the detailed mechanisms of its CNS entry and neurological infections, which lead to encephalitis in pigs.",

While PCR analysis detected PTV in the small and large intestines, lesions were only seen in the latter. PTVs have frequently been isolated from the faeces of piglets with diarrhoea, but since they can be readily isolated from normal piglets and since diarrhoea can be caused by a variety of other viral and bacterial agents, the relationship has remained correlative and not causal (Knowles, 2006) . PTVs may be considerably less important enteric pathogens than rotaviruses or coronaviruses (Knowles, 2006) . On the other hand, diarrhoea has been produced experimentally by PTVs in piglets believed to be free of other pathogens and the role of PTVs as enteric pathogens is uncertain (Knowles, 2006) . Although the PTV Toyama 2002 strain may have less enteric virulence than neurological virulence, it may have the potential to produce diarrhoea in some pigs. In addition, it would seem that the clinical manifestation of Teschovirus encephalomyelitis in the field is dependent on other, so far unidentified, factors. Further experimental studies in gnotobiotic pigs are necessary to clarify the pathogenesis of PTVs using other strains.",
