Most regions promptly complied with these recommendations, whereas Veneto maintained its policy, implemented after the occurrence of the first cases, of extensive testing and isolation of positive cases (3).

Four regions in the same area of Italy, with similar demographics, economics, and healthcare system, which were almost simultaneously hit by the virus, adopted different strategies for COVID-19 outbreak containment. In Veneto, where extensive testing was applied (3), the increase in COVID-19 mortality was milder than in the other regions, which initially clustered in a steeper relation between the number of tests and mortality. Accordingly, the proportion of positive tests was lower in Veneto than elsewhere, whereas the rate of daily increase in mortality in Emilia-Romagna, initially similar to that in Lombardy, declined when the rate of daily increase in the number of tests performed became steeper. Thus, whereas with its policy for extensive testing Veneto was efficaciously containing the spreading of the disease, Lombardy, Piedmont, and initially also Emilia-Romagna, were somehow chasing the virus, using tests more to confirm clinically plausible diagnoses than to contain the epidemics.",

Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. shows that the number of tests increased daily from February 24 through March 27 in all regions, although with marked differences. Starting from 0.3, 1.5, 0.3, and 4.5 tests per 10,000 persons by February 24, Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy, Piedmont and Veneto reached 107.2, 95.3, 45.2 and 170.5 tests per 10,000 persons by March 27. Piecewise regression showed that the progressive increase in the number of tests performed changed slope in all regions, although with different timing and extension. The slope increased by March 10 in Lombardy, March 14 in Veneto and Piedmont, and March 17 in Emilia-Romagna. It was initially lowest in Piedmont, intermediate in Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna, and maximal in Veneto (0.4, 1.3, 1.2, and 2.3 more tests per 10,000 per day, respectively). Then, it increased to a similar extent in Veneto and Emilia-Romagna, although it remained smaller in Lombardy and Piedmont than in the other two regions (8.7, 7.4, 4.2, and 2.8 more tests per 10,000 per day, respectively). From March 2 through April 3, mortality increased from 0.02, 0.04, 0.00, and 0.004 to 4.27, 8.26, 2.39, and 1.17 per 10,000 persons in Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy, Piedmont and Veneto, respectively. Figure 2 shows the relationship between the cumulative number of COVID-19 tests performed from February 24 through March 27, and the corresponding lagged mortality (March 2-April 3) in the four regions. Compared to Veneto, Lombardy, Piedmont and until March 17 also Emilia-Romagna clustered towards a steeper mortality rate increase with increasing number of tests performed. After that date, in Emilia-Romagna the slope of the relationship flattened substantially: the piecewise regression confirmed a change in the slope when the cumulative number of 41.1 tests per 10,000 was reached, in coincidence with the sudden increase in the rate of daily testing on March 18. Slopes remained unchanged in the other regions. When the cumulative number of tests All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",
