            "text": "Human rhinoviruses (HRVs), the\nviruses predominantly associated with the common cold, are highly prevalent in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. Prior to the development of sensitive molecular viral detection assays, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza virus were the most common and most concerning respiratory viral pathogens detected in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients [1]. Due to the development of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for viral detection, HRVs are now known to be the most common viruses detected from respiratory specimens in HCT recipients and can account for 25\u201340% of cases of viral respiratory infections in these patients [2\u20134] (Figure 32-1). Due to their high prevalence and their ability to cause progressive infection, HRVs are also a significant cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in HCT recipients (Table 32-1). HRV infection is also common in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, although the incidence is not known among SOT recipients as a whole. In lung transplant recipients\n, data from older retrospective and prospective studies suggests an incidence of 35\u201355% among patients with positive respiratory samples [5\u20137] (Figure 32-2). In a recent prospective surveillance study of 112\nlung transplant recipients, HRVs represented 62% of all positive samples [8]. Among symptomatic\nlung transplant recipients, HRV represented 34% of all respiratory viruses detected [9].\n\n\n",

The total number of genotypes continues to grow as new genotypes are characterized; currently at least 160 unique genotypes are described. Due to poor growth in traditional viral culture models, HRV-C was only recognized after the development of molecular diagnostic techniques. Thus, HRV-C is not a novel species, but rather one that has been circulating unnoticed due to lack of an appropriate diagnostic assay. There are several biologic characteristics of HRV-C that differentiate the species from HRV-A and HRV-B. HRV-A and HRV-B both use ICAM-1 or LDLR for cell attachment and entry, whereas it appears that HRV-C may utilize a distinct receptor, cadherin-related family member 3, that is associated with asthma susceptibility [11, 12]. Additionally, HRV-C species are stable at higher temperatures and readily infect upper and lower airways, whereas HRV-A and HRV-B species tend to be more limited to the sinuses and upper airways [13, 14]. These biologic characteristics are thought to play a role in variations in clinical outcomes observed among the different species.\n",

            "text": "With the widespread availability of PCR diagnostics, data are emerging on the incidence and clinical relevance of HRV infections in immunocompromised patients. Early studies relied on culture to detect HRV, a specific but insensitive method because the standard viral culture systems are not optimized for HRV detection, especially HRV-C [22]. For example, a Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center surveillance study from 1987 to 1992 detected HRVs in 29 specimens, and only one was from a lower respiratory tract specimen [2]. A prospective 5-year study at MD Anderson Cancer Center cultured specimens specifically for HRVs at lower temperatures with roller culture methods, and reported that HRV infections were associated with substantial morbidity and mortality in 7 of 22 (32%) myelosuppressed patients [23]. In that study, approximately one third of the adult HCT recipients who developed symptomatic HRV infections prior to engraftment had progression of upper respiratory tract symptoms to LRTI, and all cases with pneumonias were fatal. Lung biopsies and autopsies revealed findings consistent with interstitial pneumonitis and/or ARDS, but no in situ evaluation was performed to definitively assess HRV infection. Similar reports with evidence of LRTI based on radiographic and BAL findings continue to be noted [24\u201326], but it remains unknown if pneumonia is a direct cause of viral invasion of the lung tissue or by host responses in the lung. Evidence for in vitro and in vivo replication in lower respiratory tract has been shown in experimental infection, where HRV was isolated from human volunteers after intranasal HRV challenge by in situ hybridization [27]. The use of RT-PCR\ncontinues to provide new information about the frequency of HRV infection. In a study of BAL samples from 77 HCT recipients that were tested using RT-PCR\n, HRV was detected in six patients (8%), mortality rate was very high (83%) and two of the six patients showed persistent HRV infection. However, all of the HRV-infected patients had significant coinfections and it was not certain whether HRV infection was the direct cause of poor prognosis [25]. In a small cohort of patients with hematologic malignancy, LRTI was associated with hypoalbuminemia and bacterial co-pathogens were seen in 25% of patients [28].",

            "text": "Recent studies have shown that immunocompromised adults with HRV demonstrated similar hospital admission rates, intensive care unit admissions, and mortality rates as patients with pandemic H1N1 influenza [29]. Several reports have linked HRV infection to severe respiratory failure and even death [23\u201325]. Furthermore, recently presented data suggest that LRTI associated with HRV leads to a mortality rate comparable to that of RSV, influenza virus, and PIV [30], independent of the presence of co-pathogens. Risk factors for mortality following HRV LRTI included bone marrow stem cell source, oxygen requirement at time of diagnosis, and steroid use \u22651 mg/kg prior to diagnosis [30]. Other factors that may influence clinical severity include the presence of HRV RNA in blood, viral load, and HRV species type; however, no data exist in immunocompromised patients to date. HRV viral RNA was detected in the sera of 30 (12%) of 243 pediatric patients with severe HRV respiratory infection, with HRV-C being the predominant species [31]. In healthy pediatric patients, increased respiratory viral load has been associated with HRV LRTI and HRVC has been implicated as a more virulent pathogen [32\u201334]. Others, however, have shown lack of correlation between HRV-C and oxygen requirement, length of hospitalizations, and coinfections [35]. The predominance of HRV-C in HCT recipients has also been described in small studies, with higher rates of pneumonia in patients with HRV-C detected from the upper respiratory tract [36]. In a small cohort of patients with hematologic malignancies, the rate of LRTI was not different between patients infected with HRV-A, HRV-B, or HRV-C [28]. The relative risk of HRV-C infection in the immunocompromised population remains unknown, and more research is needed to define the role of strain differences on outcomes.",

In a large, prospective surveillance cohort of allogeneic HCT recipients, detection of HRV pretransplant was associated with significantly fewer days alive and out of the hospital, and significantly higher mortality at 100 days posttransplant [41]. Further, larger prospective studies are needed to determine risk factors for posttransplant complications, the role of viral load and symptom burden at the time of transplantation, and the need to potentially delay transplantation for patients with HRV present prior to transplantation. Ultimately, the issue of viral causality of disease and evaluation of prophylactic and treatment modalities will need to be addressed. The impact of HRV infection prior to SOT is not known.",

These factors can predispose to lower respiratory tract infections. The impact of HRV on outcomes in\nlung transplant recipients can range from asymptomatic infection to severe disease. In a pooled analysis of all respiratory viruses detected in\nlung transplant recipients, viruses were detected five times more frequently when respiratory symptoms were present [42]. A correlation between higher symptom scores and higher rhinovirus load in the upper respiratory tract has been demonstrated, although even asymptomatic patients can have relatively high viral loads [43]. The relative rate of progression from upper to lower tract disease for HRV specifically is not known, although the effect on lung function has been evaluated in aggregate for all respiratory viruses and suggests a decline in forced expiratory volume (FEV1) of \u22125% to \u221230% [42]. For HRV specifically, the FEV1 loss was similar to that seen in other respiratory viruses [8]. The correlation between respiratory viral infections and acute rejection, chronic rejection, and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) remains somewhat unclear, with several conflicting findings when respiratory viruses were evaluated in aggregate [6\u20138]. A recent large cohort of 250\nlung transplant recipients, however, showed an independent association between respiratory viral infections (34% HRV) and chronic lung allograft dysfunction in multivariate models [9]. This association was influenced by time, with more of an effect within a shorter period following respiratory infection. Larger, prospective studies investing individual viruses are needed to clearly assess the impact on these outcomes.\n",

The availability of more sophisticated diagnostic tools, such as RT-PCR\n, has facilitated the detection of CoVs in normal and immunocompromised persons. These improved molecular methods of viral discovery facilitated the recent identification of the novel Group 1 and 2 human CoV subtypes\u2014NL63 in 2004 [52] and HKU1 in 2005 [53].

Five patients were febrile at the time coronavirus was present, with fevers lasting 1\u20137 days. All patients initially presented with rhinorrhea and nasal discharge; two children had cough as a presenting symptom. Chest radiographs of only one of the three children were abnormal; LRTI based on decreased oxygen saturation, tachypnea, and abnormal chest radiograph was present in only one child with leukemia, who was significantly neutropenic and lymphopenic at the time CoV was detected. CoVs have been associated with LRTI in HCT recipients with sometimes fatal outcomes [66, 67, 69\u201371]. The clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection in HCT and SOT patients are not well described, and presentation can range from mild symptoms to respiratory failure and death [62\u201365, 72].\n",

With the advent of molecular detection methods and increased interest in CoV detection during the SARS outbreak, new strains of CoVs have been discovered and new RT-PCR assays developed that facilitate further studies of these viruses. Based on RT-PCR assays, four strains of non-SARS CoVs (OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1) appear to cocirculate during the non-summer months in temperate climates, and are associated with symptomatic disease in immunocompromised hosts [54].

This virus was named \u201chuman bocavirus,\u201d due to its relatedness to the genome organization of two other parvoviruses, bovine parvovirus and minute virus of canines, in the family Parvoviridae. This virus continues to be detected in young children with a winter seasonality [111\u2013113]. The relationship of HBoV and respiratory disease in immunocompromised patients is not yet clear. Preliminary evidence to date demonstrates case reports of disseminated HBoV infection with involvement of the respiratory tract, blood, and stool in several patients, sometimes associated with GVHD and prolonged viral shedding in the feces [114, 115]. Other studies have reported little evidence linking this virus with pulmonary pathology or severe respiratory disease in\nHCT or lung transplant recipients [116\u2013118]. Further research is necessary to link this virus with the disease in the transplant recipient. No specific antiviral therapy is available.\n",

New, sensitive diagnostic assays allow for routine detection of rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, coronaviruses, and bocavirus, and additional data on the epidemiology, risk factors, outcomes of infection, and the impact of different viral strains are desperately needed. Preliminary studies suggest that detection of these viruses prior to transplant may affect outcomes, but additional studies are needed to explore this important clinical area. Furthermore, as new antivirals are being developed, it will be important to identify high-risk patients that may benefit from treatment. Finally, a better understanding of these viruses will be able to inform better infection prevention strategies that will remain the mainstay of viral control.",
