The classic triad of MFS is ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia, which was first described by Miller Fisher in 1956 [1]. It is an important differential diagnosis to consider in patients presenting with acute or subacute flaccid descending paralysis and is sometimes overlooked in favor of other etiologies, such as stroke, myasthenia gravis (MG), electrolyte abnormalities, and botulism. Below, we describe a case of MFS with an atypical presentation of respiratory failure due to vocal cord paralysis, in addition to the classically reported ataxia and areflexia.",

An electrocardiogram and chest X-ray were unremarkable. A urine drug screen and serum alcohol levels were negative. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and cortisol levels were within normal limits. Thiamine, vitamin B6, and B12 levels were normal. Serological tests were negative for Lyme disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), syphilis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Blood and urine cultures obtained at presentation showed no growth. Non-contrast computed tomography (CT) of his head and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain were normal except for mild ventriculomegaly (Fig. 1). CT angiography of his head and neck revealed patent intracranial vasculature. A repetitive nerve stimulation electromyographic (EMG) study demonstrated patchy, moderate to severe, peripheral motor nerve denervation consistent with AIDP. A lumbar puncture was performed and analysis of the obtained cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed albuminocytologic dissociation with less than 3 nucleated cells per mL of fluid, elevated CSF protein of 62 mg/dl, and normal glucose levels (88 mg/dl). CSF cultures did not demonstrate any growth. Anti-GQ1B antibody and anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody levels were negative.\n",

            "text": "It is prudent to first rule out an acute vascular cause such as stroke, especially involving the cerebellum and brainstem; for example, for example, an absence of any lateralizing neurological signs and disturbed consciousness would rule out stroke, especially one with brainstem involvement. Next, metabolic abnormalities due to alcoholism, vitamin deficiencies, or electrolyte deficiencies would be evident on a metabolic panel and on serum vitamin and ethyl alcohol levels. An absence of a suggestive history of exposure to Clostridium botulinum, such as consumption of canned or tinned foods, cosmetic use of botulinum toxin injection, or intravenous drug use, significantly lowers the possibility of botulism. An absence of fever and meningeal signs, and analysis of CSF obtained on lumbar puncture, can rule out meningitis and encephalitis. Spinal cord trauma and spinal shock in the initial stages would result in flaccid paralysis of extremities aside from obvious signs of trauma. Also, concomitant bulbar paralysis is highly unlikely. Overlapping autoimmune demyelinating syndromes such as Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) and Bickerstaff\u2019s brainstem encephalitis (BBE) must be considered. GBS is more likely to have a characteristic pattern of ascending paralysis. BBE is considered to lie on the same spectrum as MFS as it may present with ataxia and ophthalmoplegia and can have positive anti-GQ1b antibodies. However, BBE is characterized more by hyperreflexia and somnolence. New-onset MG can be suspected but, in our patient, motor involvement was patchy, the anti-AChR antibody test result was negative, and EMG was not suggestive of MG.",

His overall respiratory status also improved with decreasing oxygen requirement and decreased need for tracheostomy suctioning. He continued to have moderate pharyngeal dysphagia and required placement of a jejunostomy tube for feeding. His hospitalization was also complicated with development of aspiration pneumonia. He was eventually discharged to a skilled nursing facility on a tracheostomy collar and jejunostomy tube after a total of 6 weeks of hospitalization and subsequently discharged home after making suitable progress in physical rehabilitation. He continued to follow-up with the physical medicine and rehabilitation (PMR) out-patient clinic and remained tracheostomy-dependent at 6 months following hospitalization. He was able to ambulate with a walker at that time.",

Our patient presented with stridor and respiratory distress in addition to ataxia, areflexia, and descending motor weakness. Albuminocytologic dissociation noted on CSF analysis, unremarkable central nervous system imaging, and EMG findings suggestive of patchy peripheral nerve denervation in combination with the above clinical presentation helped to narrow the otherwise wide differential diagnosis to MFS.

            "text": "MFS accounts for 1\u20135% of AIDP cases in the West but approximately one-fifth of AIDP cases in Japan and Taiwan [2, 3]. It is associated with antibodies against GQ1b (a ganglioside component) in approximately 80\u201390% of cases [4]. Anti-GQ1b antibodies develop following an infection (Campylobacter jejuni, Haemophilus influenzae) through a process of molecular mimicry as the body mounts an immune response to a biochemically similar epitope on the bacterium [5]. The presence of this antibody shows a strong association with involvement of the third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerves. Anti-GQ1b antibody can also be present in other variants of AIDP in which there is ataxia or ophthalmoplegia at presentation [6]. Multiple cases of anti-GQ1b antibody-negative MFS have been reported in the literature [7\u20139]. A study by Kimoto et al. [10] demonstrated that almost 10% of MFS cases were anti-GQ1b antibody-negative. The authors suggested that antibodies against gangliosides other than GQ1b can also play a pathogenic role in the development of MFS. This could possibly explain the absence of anti-GQ1b antibodies in the case we have described.",

            "text": "A single-center retrospective study of 157 patients with AIDP in Taiwan demonstrated bulbar dysfunction in 19 patients with MFS but no incidence of respiratory failure [3]. Although cases of vocal cord paralysis associated with classic AIDP have been reported [11, 12], we found only one reported case of vocal cord paralysis due to MFS [13]. In that case, laryngeal muscle re-innervation and pacemaker therapy was attempted successfully to treat persistent vocal cord paralysis; however, there is no discussion of the patient receiving any medical therapy such as intravenous immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis. Among the AIDP variants, MFS is considered to have a good prognosis and is usually self-limiting [14]. A Cochrane review of MFS treatment trials demonstrated that intravenous immunoglobulin did hasten recovery, affording an almost 90% chance of complete clinical recovery at 6 months as compared to a variable recovery between 60 and 100% in patients receiving only supportive therapy [15]. It has been proposed that intravenous immunoglobulin acts by blocking the Fc receptors on macrophages, thereby preventing antibody-mediated attack on Schwann cell membranes. In addition, there is inhibition of cytokines by anti-cytokine antibodies present in the pooled sera and suppression of the complement cascade [16]. There was no evidence that corticosteroids affected the overall clinical course, but early plasmapheresis (within 4 weeks of onset of symptoms) was noted to contribute to faster recovery in both ambulant and non-ambulant patients [17]. The results from trials assessing the use of a combination of above treatments are currently awaited.",
