The most common indications in children comprise biliary atresia and metabolic liver diseases. Many attempts have been made to optimize the timing of liver transplantation for advanced chronic cholestatic liver diseases. A number of investigators have developed prognostic indices using clinical and laboratory parameters for prediction of survival in patients with PBC and PSC. The most popular model, the Mayo model, considers prognostic variables such as serum levels of bilirubin and albumin, age, prothrombin time, and the presence of peripheral edema including response to diuretic therapy. Apart from the prognostic model, the level of serum bilirubin is the most heavily weighted variable for prediction of survival. In patients with PSC, interventional endoscopic therapy may produce clinical and biochemical improvement and may prolong transplant-free survival.",

Merion et al. reported that the adjusted relative mortality risk is significantly higher in transplanted patients than in those waiting for OLT with a MELD score of less than 152. Patients with MELD scores of 18 or higher derive significant survival benefit. Candidates with very high MELD scores have an extremely high waiting-list mortality whereas the post-transplant mortality risk seems to rise more gradually [2] . Those patients, whose calculated score is higher than 40 are aggregated with those whose MELD score is equal to 40.",

Therapy consists of a 6-month program including 18 hours of group sessions. The alcohol concentration in the breath and alcohol metabolites in the urine is measured at every group session.

Grade-IV encephalopathy, bleeding, as well as severe jaundice are considered particularly unfavourable. The great risk of septic complications following transplantation also accounts for high mortality.

Auxiliary liver transplantation can be further discussed in fulminant hepatitis B (also with HDV co-infection) and halothane-induced acute liver failure. It should also be mentioned that particularly crucial to the consideration of auxiliary transplantation is the extent of liver cell necrosis and moreso the potential regeneration ability. However, since there are notable predictors for the latter, the practice of auxiliary liver transplantation nowadays has been virtually abandoned.",
