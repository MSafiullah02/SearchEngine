They established a low pre-test probability (29-years-old, absence of atherosclerotic risk factors), used information from the chest CT (absence of coronary calcification), demonstrated normal left ventricular ejection fraction and absence of wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography and supported their decision with negative cardiac biomarkers (troponin and myoglobin). They made another important decision -they did not administer fibrinolytic therapy for what turned out to be a STEMI mimic.",

Logistically, we now understand that the decision to proceed with angiography carries a significant risk for nosocomial spread of the virus endangering hospital staff. We are also learning that acute kidney injury is quite prevalent and highly associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients.(6) One should think twice before administering intravenous contrast medium in these patients.",

(7) In a setting of limited staffing and resources, and where time-to-treatment is expected to be significantly delayed, fibrinolytic therapy provides a more rapid and logistically easier approach to reperfusion therapy while reducing staff exposure to infection. However, contraindications for fibrinolytic therapy have to be absent and STEMI mimics have to be excluded. The fibrinolytic strategy is probably most reasonable for hospitals without PCI-capability or immediate availability. At PCI-capable hospitals with adequate staffing, primary PCI is still preferred. (8, 9) Until there is universal availability of rapid testing (< 5 min) for both the virus and the antibodies, our approach to STEMI will have to be modified. This is primarily due to new 4 infection control considerations that will have to be included in our daily workflow. The current door-to-balloon time quality metric should be suspended by hospital quality improvement committees as a measure of system performance because of the current diagnostic and logistical challenges in delivering STEMI care. In the ACC NCDR CathPCI Registry reporting form, noting a \"system delay\" as a reason for a prolonged door-to-balloon time will avoid any external quality of care penalties.",

            "text": "Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted every aspect of cardiology practice. Importantly, the performance of primary PCI in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is increasingly challenging given delays in emergency medical system availability and transfer times, suspension of prehospital activation of the cardiac catheterization laboratory, prolonged emergency department evaluations, and infection control requirements in the cardiac catheterization laboratory that delay time-to-treatment. All this is happening while the hospital systems are facing unprecedented staffing and space challenges.(1-3) In this issue of JACC Case Reports, Loghin et al. (4) report on a young man who presented with symptoms consistent with acute hypoxic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. He was found to be COVID-19 positive. In the setting of fever and acidemia, he developed inferior ST-segment elevation. In the pre-COVID-19 era, this patient probably would have undergone emergent diagnostic coronary angiography and would not have been the subject of a case report.",
