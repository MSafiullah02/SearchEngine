Therefore, strategies are needed to at least maintain mental health and physical fitness in a safe way, such as practicing light and homebased physical exercises. This practice needs to be adapted to the home environment and directed by skilled health professionals; people with epilepsy should be guided/advised in practicing home-based exercise, which should include aerobic exercises, muscle strength exercises and flexibility exercises [21, 37] . Thus, it is necessary to outline effective education and health strategies [37, 38] in the short, medium and long term in order to minimize the negative impact of social isolation and quarantine caused by CoVID-19 for the general population and people with epilepsy.",

The most prudent thing to do is to respect social isolation and quarantine and seek alternative strategies, such as home-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 based physical exercise, which may include popular social networks (Instagram), video and information search sites (YouTube) for health promotion among the general population and people with epilepsy.",
