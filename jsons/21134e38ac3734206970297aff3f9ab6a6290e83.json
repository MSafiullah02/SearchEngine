This paper focuses on the spread of the disease by applying heatmap retrieval of hotspot areas and spatial analysis is carried out using the Moran index. For capturing spatial autocorrelation between the provinces of South Africa, the adjacent, as well as the geographical distance measures, are used as a weight matrix for both absolute and relative counts. Furthermore, generalized logistic growth curve modeling is used for the prediction of the COVID-19 spread. We expect this data-driven modeling to provide some insights into hotspot identification and timeous action controlling the spread of the virus. Figure 9 .

Within a week investigators found that the initial cases where all associated with a seafood market where live poultry and wild animals were being sold ( [2] ). Since then the disease has been registered, and become known, as the coronavirus or COVID-19 which is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). This disease has shown that in early stages of infection, symptoms of severe acute respiratory infection can occur. These may include a cough, fever and shortness of breath ( [3] ). Some patients may then develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other serious complications which may potentially lead to multiple organ failure ( [1] ). Since mid-December, COVID-19 has spread to all seven continents, increasing its prevalence throughout the entire world, and was declared a pandemic, by the World Health Organization (WHO) on the 11th of March ( [4] ). This rapid spread has been fuelled by the fact that the majority of infected people do not experience severe symptoms, which makes it more likely to remain mobile and hence infect others ( [5] ). The transmission primarily occurs through contact from person to person, coughing or sneezing and touching of contaminated surfaces ( [6] ).",

The individual, who travelled between China and Cairo on a business trip was identified through contact screening ( [7] ). The first South African case was confirmed by The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) on the morning of the 5th of March 2020. The patient, a 38 year old male, was part of a group of 10 people, including his wife, who arrived back in South Africa on the 1st of March from Europe. Since then the number of infections and deaths have risen drastically. President Cyril Rhamaphosa was praised by the director-general of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adganom Ghemreyesus, for his leadership and approach to protecting South Africans during these trying times ( [8] ). The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) also commended President Cyril Ramaphosa for his leadership and for South Africa's \"ruthlessly efficient\" response to the coronavirus ( [9] ). On the 15th of March President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a national state of disaster, the terms of the Disaster Management Act which enable the focus to be put on preventing and reducing the risk of the virus spreading ( [10] ), and only a few days later on the 23rd of March the President declared a national lockdown commencing on midnight of the 26th of March.",

The main concerns, which are thought to escalate the spread of the coronavirus, are the large and densely populated areas and townships, including a high level of poverty and movement within these areas. Combined with existing epidemics such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis (TB) and malaria, this might lead to an increase in morbidity and mortality. Since the wide spread of non-communicable diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease, hypertension and diabetes, in Africa are known risk factors for severe cases of COVID-19 these may also increase the death rate in these lowerincome countries ( [11] ). As winter is approaching, overcrowded houses and the large immunocompromised population, will contribute to the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases rising ( [12] ).",

Although it has been shown that South Africans are generally complying during the lockdown, by investigating insights from vehicle-tracking data, is was shown that vehicle activity dropped by 20% even before the lockdown and reduced by 75% after the lockdown was implemented ( [14] ). This decline in movement directly indicates the effect on the economy, with the closure of businesses like manufacturing, retail and restaurants, to name only a few. With numerous businesses no longer operating, many South Africans are no longer receiving an income. The Human Science Research Council also released a note on the mental health of South Africans, stating that the stage is already set for major mental health implications, and noting that that failure to put measures into place to mitigate the psychological impacts of quarantine, is likely to lead to an ineffective and slow economic recovery ( [15] ).",

Finding these hotspots will provide insights in identifying, and assist in tracking, the COVID-19 spread. With this information South Africa will be better able to predict local outbreaks and develop public health policies to better manage and update medical procedures currently set in place. Since the strict lockdown (level 5) is phased out from the 1st of May (moved to level 4 lockdown), the location of these hotspots could assist in guiding the riskadjusted strategy and the economic activity plan, set out by the South African government. It would thus be important to know where these hotspots are and if they are statistically significant. Further, a generalized logistic model of the growth trend will be employed to show the difference between the hotspot areas and the areas outside of it. With the continuing growth and development of COVID-19 in South Africa, this analysis might be helpful to guide political leaders and health authorities to manage the allocation of resources and prepare for future virus control.",

Some other indices include the Getis' G index, Geary's C, local Ii and Gi, spatial scan statistics and Tango's C index ( [19] and [18] ). The Moran index has both a local and global representation. The global Moran's I is a global measure for spatial autocorrelation while the local Moran's I index examines the individual locations, enabling hotspots to be identified based on comparisons to the neighbouring locations ( [19] ). This local Moran's I has been successfully applied to hotspot identification for infection clusters such as those investigated by [20] , who researched the bovine tuberculosis breakdowns (bTB )in Northern Irish cattle herds in order to access the spatial association in the number and prevalence of chronic bTB across Northern Ireland. Other areas where this index has been successfully applied and commonly used are diseases, mortality rates, environmental planning and environmental sciences. It's important to note that the result can be affected by the definition of the weight function, data transformation and existence of outliers ( [19] ).",

Comparatively, no significant spatial correlation is tested out based on spatial geographic distance (the last column of Table 2 ), which indicates the spreading direction in South Africa is mainly based on adjacent areas to neighbors, and doesn't matter how far the distance to the infectious center. So main cities adjacent to are at higher risk. To extend the analysis, we calculated the corresponding p-values of Moran's test given by Table 2 over the time, shown in Figure 5 . Comparing the corresponding p-values of Moran's test, some deviation exist in the statistical timeliness in main cities of provinces from March 21, 2020 to April 25 so it is inevitable that maybe bias occurred in our results. From April 20 to 25, the spatial autocorrelation is significantly different in terms of adjacency to main cities. This means that the prevalence of COVID-19 varies in main cities. Additional analysis has been taken into account to validate the results based on the Moran index characteristics. The observed Moran index along with its expected value and standard error are tabulated in Table 3 . The expected value of Moran index is -1/(N-1)=-1/8=-0.125 in our case. Using the adjacency weights, we obtain the same result as discussed based on Table 2 . However, since the null hypothesis that there is no spatial autocorrelation between the provinces is not rejected for the geographical distance, we can argue there is no evidence of negative auto-correlation here, as with random data you would expect it to be a negative value more often than positive.",

The high values of the R-Squared, shown at the bottom-right of each figure, also confirms the goodness of fit of all 8 models, with FS having the lowest R-Square (0.939).
