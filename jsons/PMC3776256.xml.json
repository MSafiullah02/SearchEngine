The members formed small interest groups (n = 3\u201310 members) covering the different chapters of these guidelines. A first version was sent out in March 2010 based on the corresponding chapters of the digital version (http://www.hivbook.com). The different groups were free to base their chapters on this proposal after review of the relevant literature or to create new chapters. Via an email system these new chapters were put together until the groups reached a consensus on a final draft. Four weeks before a consensus conference in Cologne on 25 June 2010, these drafts for all 12 chapters were sent out to all members of all groups and to all DAIG members with the request for suggestions for changes. The submitted suggestions for changes which were received were then sent out to the members prior to the meeting. During the consensus conference all suggestions were discussed and voted on separately. Finally, each single chapter and the whole guideline proposal were voted on separately. There was an agreement of 100 % on the whole proposal between all members of the guideline group.",

However, the importance of this recommendation under effective ART is questionable.Primary prophylaxis: IgG-positive patients with <100 CD4 T-cells/\u03bcl require primary prophylaxis. The drug regimen of choice is TMP/SMX. In cases of allergy, desensitization may be considered [40]. See above for alternatives. Primary prophylaxis can be discontinued if CD4 T-cell count is >200 cells/\u03bcl for at least 3 months.Secondary prophylaxis: In the absence of immune reconstitution, patients require lifelong secondary prophylaxis, usually consisting of half the dose needed for acute therapy [67]. Clindamycin is presumably less suitable as secondary prophylaxis as it cannot cross the intact blood\u2013brain barrier [63]. TMP/SMX also seems less effective for secondary prophylaxis. However, it may be considered because it is simple. A higher dose than that for PcP is definitely required [68, 69]. Prophylaxis may be discontinued safely if initial therapy has led to radiological resolution and if there is an immune reconstitution of >200 CD4 T-cells/\u03bcl for at least 3\u20136 months [31, 70\u201372].\n",

Discontinuation of secondary prophylaxis to avoid side effects as soon as possible is recommended and feasible [77, 100, 101]\u2014however, not before at least 6 months of maintenance therapy and immune reconstitution at a CD4 T-cell count of >100\u2013150 cells/\u03bcl.

In the first stage after discontinuation, patients undergo an ophthalmology control at least once a month.
