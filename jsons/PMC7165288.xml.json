The suggested imaging modalities are chest radiography, chest CT, and PET/CT based on the imaging department facilities. All referred individuals with suspected SARS-CoV-2 have to be imaged by same imaging protocols and scanners. The protocols could be provided by medical imaging experts (physicists and radiologists) to obtain images with highest quality and lowest patient's side effects. For example, low-radiation-dose protocols are critical in the cases of CT and PET/CT. Imaging with same scanners and protocols reduces the biases and provides more reproducible/repeatable results with minimal false positive rate.",

Based on the previous radiomics studies, we suggest three-dimensional segmentation with deep learning algorithms. In addition, automat segmentation produces lower biases than manual segmentation. In addition, three-dimensional segmentation provides more information than two-dimensional in the case of radiomics analysis. After segmentation, radiomics features are extracted, selected, and are used for further analysis. For feature selection, approved machine learning algorithms are suggested based on the previous radiomics studies. The selected radiomics features would be as main inputs for developing intelligent models.",

For developing models, in addition to radiomics data, other clinical, epidemiological, and biological data could be used. These models include diagnostic prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic models. In all these models, AI algorithms are used in combination with imaging or other features. In diagnostic models, imaging features are used for diagnosis or improving the diagnosis. Combination of quantitative and qualitative parameters (and other parameters) will result in better diagnosis and better patient management. The radiomics features could also act as prognostic and predictive markers and used for survival and side effects of disease prediction. By delta radiomics features (changes in radiomics features due to a therapy), the impacts of treatments and their correlation with patient's outcome could be assessed. In addition, by incorporating underlying diseases into the models, better predictive power may be obtained. By finding associations of radiomics features with genomics parameters of the SARS-CoV-2 such as immunological genes, biological mechanisms of the disease could be well understood and therapeutic targets are identified. In addition, patients based on their imaging features are categorized and managed.",
