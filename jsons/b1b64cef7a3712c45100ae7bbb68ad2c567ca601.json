Seasonal variations in PFOS between dry season and wet season was also monitored for more than 3 years. PFOS was detected in most water samples.

To assess the persistence of these AFFF-derived precursors, groundwater, soil, and aquifer solids were obtained in 2011 from an unlined firefighter training area at a U.S. Air Force Base where AFFF was regularly used between 1970 and 1990. On a molar basis, precursors accounted for 41-100% of the total concentration of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in archived AFFF formulations. In the training area, precursors measured by the oxidation assay accounted for an average of 23% and 28% of total PFASs (i.e., precursors and perfluorinated carboxylates and sulfonates) in groundwater and solids samples, respectively. One precursor in AFFF, perfluorohexane sulfonamide amine, was observed on several highly contaminated soil and aquifer solids samples, but no other precursors present in AFFF formulations were detected in any samples at this field site. The fraction of PFASs consisting of perfluorinated carboxylates and sulfonates was greater in groundwater and solid samples than in any archived AFFF formulations, suggesting that much of the mass of precursors released at the site was converted to perfluorinated carboxylates and sulfonates (Houtz et al., 2013). In the year 2010, effluents from 90 European WRRFs were analyzed for 156 polar organic chemical contaminants. The analyses were complemented by effectbased monitoring approaches aiming at estrogenicity and dioxin-like toxicity analyzed by in vitro reporter gene bioassays, and yeast and diatom culture acute toxicity optical bioassays. Analyses of organic substances were performed by solid-phase extraction (SPE) or liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) followed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) or gas chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS). The obtained results show the presence of 125 substances (80% of the target compounds) in European wastewater effluents, in concentrations ranging from low nanograms to milligrams per liter where PFAS is one of them",

Analysis of the degradation rates of the 12 fluorobenzene congeners showed two trends: slower degradation with increasing number of fluorine substituents and increasing degradation rates with increasing number of adjacent fluorine substituents. Besides defluorination and hydrogenation, the scope of the catalyst includes dehalogenation of polychlorinated benzenes, bromobenzene, iodobenzene, and selected mixed dihalobenzenes (Baumgartner et al., 2013).

CIP sorption was characterized as a function of pH, CIP concentration, ionic strength, and competing anion such as phosphate (0.1 mM) to cover a broad range of environmentally relevant geochemical conditions. Results indicated a bell-shaped sorption envelop where sorption of CIP on nano-Fe 3 O 4 (s) increased from 45% to 80% at pH 3.44-5.97; beyond that sorption gradually decreased to a value of 25% at pH 8.39. The application of a NF-MBR was investigated for the treatment of two pharmaceutical compounds, cyclophosphamide and CIP (Zaviska et al., 2013). The two antibiotics were weakly degraded even with acclimated sludge, and only a small fraction of these compounds was retained when the fouling of the membrane increased. However, COD, TSS and color were effectively removed and no unclogging operation was necessary (4 months of operation without chemical cleaning). The photolytic degradation of norfloxacin, enrofloxacin and CIP, fluoroquinolone antibacterials widely used in human and veterinary medicine, was investigated by Babic et al. (2013) under simulated solar irradiation in different water matrices. The results showed that investigated fluoroquinolones degrade very quickly and photodegradation followed pseudo first order kinetics. In the case of pharmaceutical mixture irradiation, no significant differences in rate constants were observed compared to single-component experiments. Tewari et al. (2013) collected water samples from five WRRFs, six canals, and in mainstream Chao Phraya River of Bangkok, in three sampling events representing different seasonal flow conditions. Fourteen major pharmaceuticals including acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, atenolol, caffeine, CIP, diclofenac, ibuprofen, mefenamic acid, naproxen, roxithromycin, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfathiazole and trimethoprim were analyzed. Levels of pharmaceutical residues in WRRF influents on average were the highest for acetylsalicylic acid (4700 ng/L), followed by caffeine (2250 ng/L) and ibuprofen (702 ng/L) while in effluents, the concentration of caffeine was the highest (307 n/L), followed by acetylsalicylic acid (261 ng/L) and mefenamic acid (251 ng/L). Simulated sunlight experiments and matrix calculations were performed by Wei et al. (2013) to differentiate the photolytic reactivity for each dissociation species of CIP. The results showed that the five dissociation species of CIP do have dissimilar photolytic kinetics and products. Their results implied that for accurate ecological risk assessment of ionizable emerging pollutants, it is necessary to investigate the environmental photochemical behavior of all dissociation species. The work by Bonvin et al. (2013) investigated the direct photolysis of human metabolites of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX). All investigated metabolites, except sulfamethoxazole beta-D-glucuronide were found to be more photostable than SMX under environmentally relevant conditions. Photolytic back-transformation to SMX was observed for 4-nitroso-SMX, indicating that this metabolite may serve as an environmental source of SMX. Borgman and Chefetz (2013) evaluated the combined effects of biosolids application and irrigation with treated effluents on the mobility of pharmaceutical compounds (PCs) in soil and elucidated the main mechanisms affecting their transport. Column-leaching experiments revealed that application of biosolids generally increased the retardation of PCs, whereas treated effluents increased the mobility of weakly acidic PCs in the biosolids-amended soils. Experiments conducted at environmentally relevant PC concentrations (similar to 1 \u00b5g/L) highlight the importance of irreversible sorption as a possible mechanism for low leachability.",

Decreasing the pH of the biologically treated effluent from 7 to 5 significantly increased the ozone degradation rate of CBZ, while decreasing the degradation rate of VLX.The effects of initial pH, humic acid concentration, and temperature on the removal of tetracycline by anaerobic granular sludge from aqueous solution were investigated byLi, Ji et al. (2013) using the batch adsorption technique. The results showed that the highest removal efficiency of 93% was achieved around pH 3.0 and the removal efficiency at the neutral pH range (pH 6.0-8.0) was about 91.5%. The thermodynamic analysis indicated that the adsorption kinetics followed the pseudosecond-order equation with Langmuir model better fitted than the Freundlich model for the description of the adsorption process.Cefazolin, one of widely used cephalosporins, was targeted byLi, Wei et al. (2013) to explore its transformation behaviors in chlorination disinfection process. Authors proposed that two kinds of reactions occurred in chlorination system, one was oxidation of thioether-sulfur to sulfoxide and di-sulfoxide, and the other was base-catalyzed electrophilic substitution of alpha-H of amide by chlorine atom. The pH value determined the occurrence of reaction types, and increasing chlorine dose promoted transformation of cefazolin.Chlorinated nitroaromatic antibiotic chloramphenicol (CAP) is a priority pollutant in wastewaters. A fedbatch bioelectrochemical system (BES) with biocathode with applied voltage of 0.5 V (served as extracellular electron donor) and glucose as intracellular electron donor was applied to reduce CAP to amine product (AMCl 2 ) by Liang et al. (2013). The biocathode BES converted 87.1 \u00b1 4.2% of 32 mg/L CAP in 4 h, and the removal efficiency reached 96.0 \u00b1 0.9% within 24 h; conversely, the removal efficiency of CAP in BES with an abiotic cathode was only 73.0 \u00b1 3.2% after 24 h. The gamma irradiation-induced degradation of sulfamethazine (SMT) in aqueous solution in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) was investigated by Liu and Wang (2013). Their results showed that gamma irradiation was effective for removing SMT in aqueous solution and its degradation conformed to the pseudo first-order kinetics under the applied conditions. When initial H 2 O 2 concentration was in the range of 0-30 mg/L, higher concentration of H 2 O 2 was more effective for the decomposition and mineralization of SMT; however, the removal of total organic carbon (TOC) was not as effective as that of SMT. The study by Lozano et al. (2013) presented a investigation of Triclocarban (TCC), TCS, and Methyltriclosan (MeTCS) concentrations in the liquid phase (dissolved + particulate) as well as solid phases within a single, large WRRF. Total TCC and TCS concentrations decreased by >97% with about 79% of TCC and 64% of TCS transferred to the solids. The highest TCC and TCS removal rates from the liquid phase were reached in the primary treatment mainly though sorption and settling of solids. The coupling of membrane separation and photocatalytic oxidation was studied by Martinez et al. (2013) for the removal of pharmaceutical pollutants. The retention properties of two different membranes (nanofiltration and reverse osmosis) were assessed along with the abatement of concentrated pharmaceuticals of the rejected stream by means of heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation using TiO 2 and Fe 2 O 3 /SBA-15 in presence of hydrogen peroxide as photo-Fenton system. Both photocatalytic treatments showed significant removals of pharmaceutical compounds, achieving values between 80 and 100%. The aim of the paper by Michael et al. (2013) was to critically review the fate and removal of various antibiotics in wastewater treatment, focusing on different processes in view of the current concerns related to the induction of toxic effects in aquatic and terrestrial organisms, and the occurrence of antibiotics that may promote the selection of antibiotic resistance genes and bacteria, as reported in the literature. Authors found that the removal efficiency during wastewater treatment processes varied and was mainly dependent on a combination of antibiotics' physicochemical properties and the operating conditions of the treatment systems. As a result, the application of alternative techniques including membrane processes, activated carbon adsorption, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), and combinations of them, which may lead to higher removals, was found to be necessary before the final disposal of the effluents for their reuse for irrigation or groundwater recharge. The fate and removal of 48 PPCPs during anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge were investigated in four full-scale WRRF by Narumiya et al. (2013). Their results showed changes in K d values of PPCPs with carboxyl or amino functional groups, probably due to a shift of dissociation equilibrium with the increase in pH.Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were almost completely degraded (>90%); TCS, TCC, and ofloxacin were moderately degraded (around 30-50%); but CBZ was not eliminated.The research byOttmar et al. (2013) attempted to evaluate a previously developed model for predicting influent concentrations of prescription pharmaceuticals and understand why some drugs are more accurately predicted than others.

The most representative pharmaceutical families found in water were described and related water pollution issues were analyzed. The performances of different water treatment systems in the removal of pharmaceuticals were also summarized. Comprehensive study on the occurrence and fate of several classes of antimicrobials, including sulfonamides, trimethoprim, fluoroquinolones and macrolides, in Croatians municipal wastewaters was performed by Senta et al. (2013) using an integrated approach, which comprised analysis of both dissolved and particulate fractions. A nation-wide screening showed ubiquitous occurrence of human-use antimicrobials in raw wastewater samples with the total concentrations ranging from 2 to 20 \u00b5g/L, while veterinary antimicrobials were typically present in much lower concentrations (<100 ng/L). The percentage of the particulate fraction in raw wastewater varied significantly depending on the type of the antimicrobial and the load of suspended solids. The study by Subedi et al. (2013) included a nationwide survey of psychoactive pharmaceuticals (i.e., antischizophrenics, anxiolytics, and antidepressants) in sludge from 40 representative WRRFs that receive domestic, industrial, or mixed (domestic plus industrial) and produced by combining sol-gel and assembling processes (Tang, Zhang et al., 2013). Taking advantages of graphene and TiO 2 , the catalyst exhibited strong light absorption in the visible region and high adsorption capacity to organic pollutants, resulting in almost 100% photocatalytic removal efficiency of typical herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) from water under simulated solar light irradiation. The degradation of caffeine in different kind of effluents, via photo-Fenton process, was investigated in lab-scale and in a solar pilot plant by Trovo et al. (2013). The treatment conditions (caffeine, Fe 2+ and H 2 O 2 concentrations) were defined by experimental design. The optimized conditions for each variable, obtained using the response factor (% mineralization), were: 52.0 mg/L caffeine, 10.0 mg/L Fe 2+ and 42.0 mg/L H 2 O 2 (replaced in kinetic experiments). Although lower mineralization rates were verified for high organic load, under the same operational conditions, less H 2 O 2 was necessary to mineralize the dissolved organic carbon as the initial organic load increases.",

Under both redox conditions, degradation was stereospecific and followed similar trends in half-lives, 17 beta-E2 < 17 alpha-E2 < E1, with degradation considerably slower under sulfate reducing conditions. Results supported the inclusion of isomer-specific behavior and the potential for reversible transformation and interconversion in anaerobic sediments in modeling fate in stream networks and developing risk management strategies. Qiang et al. (2013) investigated the degradation efficiencies of several typical endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during sludge ozonation, including estrone (El), estriol (E3), 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2), BPA, and 4-nonylphenol (NP). Results indicated that the EDCs present in activated sludge could be effectively removed by ozone even though the apparent rate constants in sludge were 3-4 orders of magnitude lower than those in water; however, authors noted that the applied ozone dose should be prudently controlled because a low dose may lead to an increase of BPA and NP concentrations in the liquid phase of activated sludge. Furthermore, H 2 O 2 addition or pH adjustment could improve the removal of most studied EDCs, but could exert a negative effect on the more hydrophobic and refractory compound, NP. The removal of six EDCs, including El, E2, E3, EE2, BPA, and NP, was investigated by Qing et al. (2013) in 20 rural WRRFs using one of the four treatment processes: activated sludge (AS), constructed wetland (CW), stabilization pond (SP), and micro-power biofilm reactor (MP). Results indicated that all the six EDCs were detected in wastewater samples with NP showing a maximum detection frequency (97%) and a maximum influent concentration (5002 ng/L). After biological treatment, the concentrations of E2, E3 and NP decreased remarkably, while El, EE2 and BPA exhibited varying removal efficiencies that depended on the specific treatment process and sampling season. In general, the centralized AS process outperformed those decentralized processes (i.e., CW, SP and MP) and a higher removal of El, EE2, NP and BPA in the AS process was observed in summer (>70%) than in winter while among the three decentralized processes, the removal of EDCs in the SP process was limited, especially for El, EE2 and BPA (18-46%) in winter. Home-made Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Samplers (POCIS) were studied by Vallejo et al. (2013) for passive sampling of 15 EDCs (4 alkylphenols and steroid hormones) in influent and effluent samples of WRRFs as well as up-and downstream of the receiving river water. While the influent concentration of BPA, cisADT, E1, TT, PG, EE2 reached the \u00b5g/L level, the rest of the target analytes were determined at ng/L. The analyte concentrations in the effluent never exceed ng/L level except for BPA.A sequential relative rate technique was used to investigate the effects of water components on the rates of (OH)-O-center dot generation and EE2 degradation in a modified flat plate serpentine reactor, Cl -, Na + , Fe 3+ , dissolved organic matter (DOM) etc..

At room temperature conditions, greater than 86% degradation efficiency was achieved within 24 h of reaction time for a mixture containing 0.05 g of magnesium and four selected oxygenated aromatic hydrocarbons with 250 mg/L concentrations. It is noted that glacial acetic acid is needed as an activator for the degradation reaction to proceed. Reductive was the possible pathway of transformation(Elie et al., 2013).Degradation of benzene by coil, bolt, and rod shaped electrodes in a dielectric barrier/packed-bed discharge plasma reactor were systematically investigated byJiang et al. (2013). The reactor using the coil electrode showed better performance in reducing the dielectric loss in the barrier compared to that using the bolt or rod electrodes. In the case of the coil electrode, both the benzene degradation efficiency and energy yield were higher than those for the other electrodes, which can be attributed to the increased role of surface mediated reactions. Irrespective of the electrode geometry, the packed-bed discharge plasma was superior to the dielectric barrier discharge plasma in benzene degradation at any specific applied voltage. The main gaseous products of benzene degradation were CO, CO 2 , H 2 O, and formic acid.Discharge products such as O 3 , N 2 O, N 2 O 5 , and HNO 3 were also detected in the outlet gas.Sorption of phenanthrene (PHE) by plant-residue derive biochars (PLABs) and animal waste-derived biochars (ANIBs) obtained at two heating treatment temperatures (450 and 600 o C) and their corresponding deashed biochars was investigated. Organic carbon (OC)normalized distribution coefficients (K oc ) of PHE by biochars generally increased after deashing, likely due to enhancement of favorable and hydrophobic sorption sites caused by mineral removal. Positive correlation between PHE log K oc by PLABs and bulk polarity combined with negative correlation between PHE log K oc values by ANIBs and surface polarity suggested PLABs and ANIBs have different sorption mechanisms (Sun et al., 2013). Plumes containing more than one contaminant can be found in sites polluted by gasoline or chlorinated solvents. Yeh et al. (2013) designed an experiment to test degradation of organic compounds in couples. methyl-t-butyl-ether, benzene, and toluene were mixed in pairs and degraded by the goethitecatalyzed Fenton-like reaction at neutral pH and low H 2 O 2 doses. Results revealed that the amount of each compound removed in bicontaminant systems was less than that in one-contaminant systems. This decline in removal was related to the reactivity constant (k (HO center dot) ), initial concentration (C 0 ), and number of double bonds of the compounds. When the k (HO center dot) values of two compounds differed considerably, the one with the larger k (HO center dot) value or the higher C 0 reduced or inhibited the Fenton-like reaction of the pollutant with the smaller k (HO center dot) or lower C 0 . Compounds with few double bonds tended to be less competitive for Fenton-like removal. By adding H 2 O 2 repeatedly, the removal of a compound that is less competitive for the Fenton-like reaction can be recovered (Yeh et al., 2013). Phenolics. Nationwide inventories of alkylphenol surfactants in U.S. sewage sludges (SS) using samples from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's 2001 national SS survey showed that nonylphenol (NP) was the most abundant analyte (534 \u00b1 192 mg/kg) in SS composites, followed by its mono-and di-ethoxylates (62.1 \u00b1 28 and 59.5 \u00b1 52 mg/kg, respectively). The mean annual load of NP and its ethoxylates in SS was estimated at 2408-7149 metric tonnes, of which 1204-4289 is applied on U.S. land. NP compounds showed observable loss from SS/soil mixtures (1:2), with mean half-lives ranging from 301 to 495 days. Surfactant levels in U.S. SS ten-times in excess of European regulations, substantial releases to U.S. soils, and prolonged half-lives found under field conditions (Venkatesan and Halden, 2013a). Liu, Zhang et al. (2013) investigated the occurrence of 14 phenolic compounds (PCs) in the raw, treated wastewater, dewatered sludge and gas samples from a coking WRRF in China. It was found that 3-cresol was the dominant compound in the raw coking wastewater with a concentration of 183 mg/L, and that chlorophenols and nitrophenols were in the level of \u00b5g/L. Phenol was the dominant compound in the gas samples, while 2,4,6trichlorophenol predominated in the dewatered sludge sample. The anaerobic and aerobic treatment units played key roles in the elimination of chlorophenols and phenols, respectively. Analysis of daily mass flows of PCs in WRRF showed that 89-98% of phenols and 83-89% of nitrophenols were biodegraded, and that 44-69% of chlorophenols were adsorbed to sludge, indicating that the fate of PCs was highly influenced by their biodegradability and physical-chemical property. The degradation of m-cresol solution using an electrochemical oxidation system with Ti/SnO 2 -Sb 2 O 5 -IrO 2 anode for anodic oxidation and porous carbonnanotube-containing cathode for H 2 O 2 electrogeneration along with Fe 3+ reduction was studied. The porous cathode made of graphite, carbon nanotube (CNT) and polytetrafluoroethene (PIPE) exhibited a higher catalytic activity toward O 2 reduction producing H 2 O 2 and Fe 3+ reduction for Fe 2+ regeneration, favoring m-Cresol degradation by electro-Fenton oxidation. Furthermore, the aerobic biological treatment showed that the electrochemical treatment was able to evidently enhance the biodegradability of m-cresol solution (Chu et al., 2013). Magnetic TiO 2 (MT) composites were prepared and applied to decompose phenol, which is one of the listed priority pollutants. The total organic carbon and ringremaining intermediates of o-DHB, p-DHB and 1,4-BQ in solution were detected during the photodegradation of phenol. The results suggested that recyclable MT composites prepared in this study, which belonged to the category of recyclable green materials, exhibit good photocatalytic activity to degrade phenol so as to possess applicable potential for the degradation of refractory organics in the aqueous solution (Chang and Tseng, 2013). The electrochemical degradation of oaminophenol (OAP) in aqueous solution by galvanostatic electrolysis using Ti/SnO 2 -Sb 2 O 3 /PbO 2 as anode was investigated. The experimental results showed that the refractory organics in wastewater can be removed by pure electrochemical process. COD removal efficiency of 91.6% was obtained in 70 min at initial pH 11.0 and current density was equal to 50 mA cm 2 . Addition of a novel catalyst, gamma-Al 2 O 3 supported Ce-doped CuO, improved the efficiency of degradation and COD removal reached to 91.7% in 20 min under mild conditions (Chen, Yu et al., 2013). Simultaneous oxidation of sulfite and organic pollutants in water using Photo-sulfite reaction as a green advanced oxidation process was studied by Guo, Lou et al. (2013). The photo-sulfite system (UV-Fe(III)-sulfite) efficiently decomposed 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) and other organic pollutants at all conditions tested. The reactivity of photo-sulfite system was sustained due to the spontaneous switch of photoactive species from Fe(III)sulfito to Fe(III)-hydroxo complexes with the depletion of sulfite and the decrease in pH. In contrast, in the absence of light the performance of the Fe(III)-sulfite system was greatly diminished after the consumption of sulfite. The formation of the Fe(III)-sulfito complex is a necessary step for initiating the photo-sulfite reaction. Inhibition of the or more of the oxidation of 2,4,6-TCP and methyl orange (MO) was observed in the presence of ligands that can stabilize one of the reactants: Fe(III), Fe(II), or sulfite (Guo et al., 2013c). Jing et al. (2013) showed that modification of nano-oxides (e.g., nano-SiO 2 ) with cationic surfactants (e.g., cetyl pyridinium chloride, CPC) has superior sorptive capacity for the removal of organic contaminants from wastewater. The partitioning of nonpolar naphthalene into coated CPC was induced by hydrophobic effect alone and presenting linear isotherms, while that of polar pnitrophenol was induced by not only the hydrophobic effect but also the hydrogen-bonding interaction and presenting isotherm nonlinearity (Jing et al., 2013). UV C , H 2 O 2 /UV C , Fenton and photo-Fenton treatment of a nonylphenol polyethoxylate (NP-10) were comparatively studied and acute toxicity of treated solutions on Vibrio fischeri was tested.

Growth of cells on propane as the sole carbon source greatly enhanced degradation rates when contrasted with cells grown on complex organics which verified that propane monooxygenase involves in the biotransformation along with the genetics experiments. Propane-induced rates in order of fastest to slowest were NDMA > NDEA > NDPA > NPYR > NMOR at concentrations <2000 \u00b5g/L. Removal rates for linear functional groups scaled inversely with mass and cyclic nitrosamines were more recalcitrant than linear nitrosamines. Controls demonstrated significant NDEA and NDPA losses independent of biomass, suggesting abiotic processes may play a role in attenuation of these two compounds under experimental conditions tested(Homme and Sharp, 2013).The attenuation of bulk organic matter and trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) was evaluated for various aquifer recharge and recovery (ARR)-ozone (O 3 ) hybrid treatment process combinations using soil-batch reactor and bench-scale ozonation experiments as a proof of concept prior to pilot and/or field studies. NDMA was eliminated below the method detection limit (<5 ng/L) both during ARR treatment alone and the ARR-ozone hybrid(Yoon, Drewes et al., 2013).Explosives.A study showed that aggressive TAML activator with peroxides boosts the effectiveness of the known surfactant/base promoted breakdown of 2,4,6trinitrotoluene (TNT) and transforms the surfactant induced nondestructive binding of base to 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (TNB) into an extensive multistep degradation process.Treatment of basic cationic surfactant solutions of either TNT or TNB with TAML/peroxide (hydrogen peroxide and tert-butylhydroperoxide, TBHP) gave complete pollutant removal for both in less than 1 h with above 75% of the nitrogen and above 20% of the carbon converted to nitrite/nitrate and formate, respectively(Kundu et al., 2013) A novel highly photocatalytic graphene-ZnO-Au nanocomposites (G-ZnO-Au NCs) has been developed byRoy et al. (2013) and used to reduce nitrobenzene. About 97.8% of nitrobenzene was reduced to aniline during a reaction course of 140 min was achieved. The efficiency of G-ZnO-Au NCs is 3.5-and 4.5-fold higher than those provided by commercial TiO 2 and ZnO NSs, respectively.Water Environment Research, Volume 86, Number 10-Copyright \u00a9 2014 Water Environment FederationThe result also revealed that the reduction of NB to aniline was through nitrosobenzene to phenylhydroxylamine in the photoelectrocatalytic reaction, while via nitrosobenzene directly in the photocatalytic reaction. G-ZnO-Au NC photocatalyst holds great potential in removal of organic pollutants like nitrobenzene and in the production of aniline(Roy et al., 2013).Acidic compounds. Misiti, Tandukar et al. (2013) measure naphthenic acids (NAs) in crude oil, desalter brine, influent, activated sludge mixed liquor and effluent refinery samples received from six United States refineries. The total acid number (TAN) of the six crudes tested ranged from 0.12 to 1.5 mg KOH/g crude oil and correlated to the total NA concentration in the crudes. The total NA concentration in the desalter brine, influent, activated sludge mixed liquor and effluent samples ranged from 4.2 to 40.4, 4.5 to 16.6, 9.6 to 140.3 and 2.8 to 11.6 mg NA/L, respectively. The NAs in all wastewater streams accounted for less than 16% of the total COD, indicating that many other organic compounds are present and that NAs are a minor component in refinery wastewaters. Susceptibility tests showed that none of the activated sludge heterotrophic microcosms was completely inhibited by NAs up to 400 mg/L. Growth inhibition ranging from 10 to 59% was observed in all microcosms at and above 100 mg NA/L. Throughout a 90-day incubation period, the total NA concentration decreased by 33 and 51% in PAC-free and PAC-containing mixed liquor microcosms, respectively. The lower molecular weight fraction of NAs was preferentially degraded in both mixed liquors. The persistence of the residual, higher molecular weight NAs is likely a combination of molecular recalcitrance and decreased bioavailability when chronically-sorbed to the biomass and/or PAC (Misiti, Tezel et al., 2013). Electro-Fenton (EF) oxidation of salicylic acid (SA) from an aqueous solution was studied in a continuous stirred tank reactor with the purpose of optimizing the process parameters on a laboratory scale. In this study, electrolytic reactions carried out for 100 mg/L of SA solution, the parameters of catalyst concentration, pH, voltage, flow rate (residence time), and electrode spacing were varied. A maximum of 70% oxidation was obtained at an initial Fe 2+ concentration of 5 mg/L, pH of 2.5, voltage of 2.5 V, flow rate of 10 mL/min, and electrode spacing of 3 cm, after 10 h of electrolysis (George et al., 2013). In a study by Gu et al. (2013), a sewage sludge derived porous carbon (SC), which was prepared by physicochemical activation and carbonization (600 o C), was applied for the adsorption and degradation of 1to 9 mg/L) and 48.1% TOC Water Environment Research, Volume 86, Number 10-Copyright \u00a9 2014 Water Environment Federation reduction, far higher than the efficiency of 46% and 24by a biologically active carbon (BAC) column that were efficient in degrading tri-and di-HAAs, and mono-and di-HAAs, respectively was developed by Tang, Wang et al. (2013). The process tested to remove trichloroacetic acid (TCAA). An empty bed contact time of 10 min achieved nearly complete removal of 1.2 \u00b5M TCAA and its subsequent products, dichloroacetic acid (DCAA) and monochloroacetic acid (MCAA). HAA removal was a result of chemical dehalogenation and biodegradation rather than physical adsorption. Preliminary kinetic analyses were conducted and the pseudo-first-order rate constants were estimated at ambient conditions for Fe reduction of TCAA and biodegradation of DCAA and MCAA by SAC. Siloxanes. The fate and behavior of D5), and dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane (D6) in the environment were reviewed by Wang, Norwood et al. (2013). They evaluated cVMS usage data and patterns, physico-chemical properties, toxicology, partitioning and degradation, methods of detection, and concentrations. The use of cVMS as an intermediate in the formation of silicone polymers, personal care and household products has resulted in their widespread environmental exposure; they have been detected in biogas, air, water, soil, biosolid, sediment, and biota samples. Modeled and experimental results suggest that cVMS may be subject to long-range atmospheric transport, but have low potential to contaminate the Arctic. For D4 and D5, there was no evidence of trophic biomagnification in aquatic food webs, while some aquatic organisms demonstrated a high degree of bioconcentration and bioaccumulation. High concentrations of cVMS observed in indoor air and biosolids resulted from point sources. Concentrations of cVMS in water, sediment, and soil were all below their noobserved-effect-concentrations. The occurrence and fate of 5 cyclic (D3 to D7) and 12 linear (L3 to L14) siloxanes in raw and treated wastewater (both particulate and dissolved phases) as well as in sludge from a WRRF in Athens, Greece were investigated. Cyclic and linear siloxanes (except for L3) were detected in all influent wastewater and sludge samples at mean concentrations of (sum of 17 siloxanes) 20 \u00b5g/L and 75 mg/kg, respectively. The predominant compounds in wastewater were L11 (24% of the total siloxane concentration), L10 (16%), and D5 (13%), and in sludge were D5 (20%) and L10 (15%). For 10 of the 16 compounds detected in influents, the removal efficiency was higher than 80%. Sorption to sludge and biodegradation and/or volatilization losses are important factors that affect the fate of siloxanes in WRRFs. The mean total mass of siloxanes that enter into the WRRF via influent was 15.1 kg/day, and the mean total mass released into the environment via effluent was 2.67 kg/day those found in Southern Ontario and Southern Quebec, Canada. In addition, receiving water and sediment impacted by WRRF effluents, and biosolidamended soil from agricultural fields were also analyzed for a preliminary evaluation of the environmental exposure of cVMS in media impacted by wastewater effluent and solids. Concentrations of D4, D5, and D6 in influents to the 11 WRRFs were in the range 0.282-6.69 \u00b5g/L, 7.75-135 \u00b5g/L, and 1.53-26.9 \u00b5g/L, respectively. In general, wastewater treatment showed cVMS removal rates of greater than 92%, regardless of treatment type. The D4, D5, and D6 concentration ranges in effluent were <0.009-0.045 \u00b5g/L, <0.027-1.56 \u00b5g/L, and <0.022-0.093 \u00b5g/L, respectively. The concentrations in receiving water influenced by effluent, were lower compared to those in effluent in most cases, with the ranges <0.009-0.023 \u00b5g/L, <0.027-1.48 \u00b5g/L, and <0.022-0.151 \u00b5g/L for D4, D5, and D6, respectively. Sediment concentrations ranged from <0.003-0.049 \u00b5g/g-dw, and 0.011-5.84 \u00b5g/g-dw, and 0.004-0.371 \u00b5g/g-dw for 04, D5, and D6, respectively.The concentrations in biosolid-amended soil, having values of <0.008-0.017 \u00b5g/g-dw, <0.007-0.221 \u00b5g/g-dw, and <0.009-0.711 \u00b5g/g-dw for 04, D5, and 06, respectively, were lower than those in sediment impacted by wastewater effluent in most cases.

            "text": "Hendren et al. (2013) provided a critical review of traditional and emerging exposure modeling approaches to highlight the challenges that scientists and decisionmakers face when developing environmental exposure and risk assessments for nanomaterials. Authors found that accounting for nanospecific properties, overcoming data gaps, realizing model limitations, and handling uncertainty were key to developing informative and reliable environmental exposure and risk assessments for engineered nanomaterials. They also found methods suited to recognizing and addressing significant uncertainty to be most appropriate for near-term environmental exposure modeling, given the current state of information and the current insufficiency of established deterministic models the relative impact of humic(HA)    and fulvic fraction of NOM on the stability and mobility of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), a combination of dynamic light scattering and quartz crystal microgravimetry with dissipation monitoring was used byFurman et al. (2013).Authors found that in the absence of unbound NOM, (1) surface modification on either AgNP or silica substrate by different NOM fractions could lead to substantial changes in the extent and kinetics of AgNP aggregation and deposition, and (2) HA has a greater capability to enhance the transport of AgNPs by reducing their aggregation and deposition. With unbound NOM, HA competed more successfully for binding sites on the substrate under electrostatically favorable conditions and formed a steric layer to prevent subsequent deposition of AgNPs.Time-resolved dynamic light scattering was employed byHe et al. (2013) to measure the aggregation kinetics of AgNPs over a range of monovalent electrolyte (NaCl) concentrations. An aggregation dissolution model, in which the proportion of accessible reactive sites on primary particles as well as the aggregate size and 131 were assumed to be key determinants of reactivity, was found to provide an excellent description of the decline of normalized rate of dissolution of AgNPs during aggregation for different NaCl concentrations. The model also provided fundamental insights into the factors accounting for the observed change in rate of dissolution of AgNPs on injection into seawater thereby facilitating improved prediction of the likely toxicity of AgNPs in the marine environment. Kaegi et al. (2013) conducted experiments addressing the behavior of Ag-NP in sewers and in WRRF by spiking Ag-NP to a 5 km long main trunk sewer and collecting 40 wastewater samples after 500 m, 2400 m and 5000 m each according to the expected travel times of the Ag-NP. Mass closure of the Ag derived by multiplying the measured Ag concentrations times the volumetric flow rates indicated an efficient transport of the Ag-NP without substantial losses to the sewer biofilm. Ag-NP reacted with raw wastewater in batch experiments were sulfidized to roughly 15% after 5 h reaction time as revealed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Authors concluded that Ag-NP discharged to the wastewater stream may become sulfidized to various degrees in the sewer system and can be efficiently transported to the WRRF where very high removal efficiencies may divert most of the Ag-NP mass flow to the digester and only a small fraction of the Ag may be released to surface waters. Levard et al. (2013) focused on the dissolution behavior Of AgNPs in chloride-containing systems and also investigates the effect of chloride on the growth inhibition of E.coli (ATCC strain 33876) caused by Ag toxicity. Their results suggested that the kinetics of dissolution were strongly dependent on the Cl/Ag ratio and can be interpreted using the thermodynamically expected speciation of Ag in the presence of chloride. They also showed that the toxicity of AgNPs to E.coli at various Clconcentrations was governed by the amount, of dissolved AgClx(x-1)-species suggesting an ion effect rather than a nanoparticle effect. Li, Hartmann et al. (2013) analyzed the fieldcollected samples from nine municipal WRRFs to evaluate the reduction in AgNPs by mechanical and biological treatments in sequence in WRRFs. The AgNPs concentrations in influent were all low (<1.5 \u00b5g/L) and decreased (average removal efficiency of similar to 35%) significantly after mechanical treatment, indicating that the mechanical treatment contributed to the AgNPs removal. Afterward, more than 72% of the remaining AgNPs in the semi treated wastewater (i.e., wastewater after mechanical treatment) were reduced by biological treatment. Together, these processes reduced 95% of the AgNPs that entered WRRFs, which resulted in low concentration of AgNPs in the effluents (<12 ng/L). Park et al. (2013) investigated the removal of engineered NPs (AgNPs, TiO 2 NPs, and SiO 2 NPs) using activated sludge by evaluating the effects of several important factors of the NPs, including physicochemical properties, contact time between NPs and activated sludge, aquatic chemistry of sewage, and the presence of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in the activated sludge. For all three types of NPs tested, a considerable amount of NPs were removed after exposure to activated sludge in a time-dependent manner; nevertheless, the removal efficiencies depended on the type of NPs and seemed to be affected by the NP stability relative to the hydrodynamic diameter (HDD) and zeta potential. In addition, the presences of both ionic compounds and EPS significantly enhanced the NP removal efficiency, indicating that the instability of the NPs resulting from the ionic strength in sewage and entrapment of NP by EPS played an important role in NP removal by activated sludge. Yuan, Chen et al. (2013) investigated the dissolution, aggregation, and reaction kinetics of AgNPs with the three types of water disinfectants (ultraviolet, sodium hypochlorite, and ozone) under the different conditions of pH, ionic strength, or humic acid (HA). The physicochemical changes of AgNPs were measured by using UV-Vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer. The results showed that when AgNPs contacted the disinfectants, oxidative dissolution was the primary reaction while the reaction kinetics studies revealed that the reaction rate of AgNPs with disinfectants was significantly influenced by different disinfectants along with different pH and the presence of sodium nitrate and HA. The extent and mechanism of sulfidation of ZnO NPs were investigated by Ma et al. (2013), and the properties of resulting products were characterized. Synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that transformation of ZnO to ZnS occurs readily at ambient temperature in the presence of inorganic sulfide. The extent of sulfidation depends on sulfide concentration, and close to 100% conversion can be obtained in 5 days given sufficient addition of sulfide. Sulfidation also led to NP aggregation and a decrease of surface charge which suggested that sulfidation of ZnO NPs alters the behavior, fate, and toxicity of ZnO NPs in the environment. Bolyard et al. (2013) sought to understand the behavior of engineered nanoparticles in landfill leachate by examining the interactions between nanoparticles and leachate components. The primary foci of their study were the effects of ZnO, TiO 2 , and Ag nanoparticles on biological landfill processes and the form of Zn, Ti, and Ag in leachate following the addition of nanoparticles. Coated nanopartides did not affect biological processes when added to leachate; five-day biochemical oxygen demand and biochemical methane potential results were not statistically different when exposed to nanoparticles, presumably due to the low concentration of dissolved free ionic forms of the associated metals resulting from the interaction with leachate components. The removal of uncoated ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) during simulated wastewater treatment processes and its impact on treatment performance were examined by Hou et al. (2013). They found that simulated primary clarification removed the majority (about 70%) of the dosed ZnO NPs while during simulated sequencing batch reactor (SBR) processes, ZnO NPs were completely removed in each cycle throughout the 11-day experimental duration. Continuous input of ZnO NPs into the wastewater (at concentrations up to 5 mg/L) did not reduce chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal while al. (2013) studied the aggregation kinetics and stability of graphene oxide (GO) using timeresolved dynamic light scattering over a wide range of aquatic chemistries (pH, salt types (NaCl, MgCl 2 , CaCl 2 ), ionic strength) relevant to natural and engineered systems.Although pH did not have a notable influence on GO stability from pH 4 to 10, salt type and ionic strength had significant effects on GO stability due to electrical double layer compression, similar to other colloidal particles. It was found that the natural organic matter significantly improved the stability of GO in water primarily due to steric repulsion while long-term stability studies demonstrated that GO was highly stable in both natural and synthetic surface waters; while GO remained stable in synthetic influent wastewater, effluent wastewater collected from a treatment plant rapidly destabilized GO, indicating GO will settle out during the wastewater treatment process and likely accumulate in biosolids and sludge.Khan et al. (2013) evaluated the influence of organic matter type and concentration in landfill-relevant conditions on SWNT transport through a packed-bed of mixed municipal solid waste collectors. Results indicated that SWNT transport may be significant in mature waste environments, with mobility decreasing with decreasing humic acid concentration. SWNT mobility in the presence of acetic acid was inhibited, suggesting their mobility in young waste environments may be small. SWNTs also exhibited collector media-dependent transport, with greatest transport in glass and least in paper.",

The oxygen and nitrogen donor atoms containing Lewis base N-methyl-N-phenyl-1,10-phenanthroline-2-carboxamide (MePhPTA) ligand was synthesized and subsequently an adsorbent was prepared by direct immobilization onto mesoporous silica.Their results suggested that hybrid Lewis base adsorbent has a good prospect of promising applications for separation/sorption of lanthanide ions from effluents.Jackson et al. (2013) evaluated the removal of mercury from wastewater using chemical reduction and air stripping with a full-scale treatment system. Their results indicated that chemical reduction coupled with air stripping can effectively treat large volumes of water to emerging part-per-trillion regulatory standards for mercury.Pasakarnis et al.

In the absence of chloride, reduction of Hg(II) to Hg(0) was observed over a range of magnetite stoichiometries (0.29 < x < 0.50) in purged headspace reactors and unpurged low headspace reactors. In the presence of chloride, however, X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy indicated the formation FGD) gypsum for the treatment of leachate from the coal ash (CA) dump sites. Leaching tests of coal bottom ash (CBA) carried out at acidic pH revealed the existence of several heavy metals such as Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, Mn, Cu, Ni and Zn. Sulfide rich effluent from the sulfate reduction process was used to precipitate heavy metals as metal sulfides from CBA leachate with removal efficiencies ranging from 40 to 100%.Kamei-Ishikawa et al. (2013) studied the fate of stable strontium (Sr) in the sewage treatment process as a means to predict the fate of radiostrontium. In the mass balance of Sr in the sewage treatment plant, 76% of the Sr entering the plant was discharged to the receiving water on average; additionally, 14% of the Sr flowing through the plant was transferred to the sewage sludge and then concentrated in the sludge ash without being released to the atmosphere. Sr was also shown to sorb on the activated sludge; however, the measurements indicated Sr desorption from activated sludge occurred 48 h after the contact.The research byLuo, Tian et al. (2013) investigated the fate of As(V) adsorbed on nano-TiO 2 in the presence of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) Desulfovibrio vulgaris strains DP4 and ATCC 7757. The incubation results demonstrated that As(V) was desorbed from nano TiO 2 , and subsequently reduced to As(III) in aqueous solution. The release of adsorbed As(V) was two to three times higher in biotic samples than that in abiotic controls.Water Environment Research, Volume 86, Number 10-Copyright \u00a9 2014 Water Environment FederationThe study byXu, Capito et al. (2013) focused on selective removal of arsenic and monovalent ions from brackish groundwater reverse osmosis (RO) concentrate for beneficial use and safe environmental disposal using in situ and pre-formed hydrous ferric oxides/hydroxides adsorption, and electrodialysis (ED) with monovalent permselective membranes. A method using ferric sludge from surface water treatment plant was demonstrated as an efficient adsorbent to remove arsenic from RO concentrate, providing a promising low cost, \"waste treat waste\" approach.Muehe et al. (2013) described the Fe mineralogy and As mobility during the reduction of As-loaded biogenic and abiogenic Fe(III) minerals by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. They found that microbial reduction of As(III)bearing biogenic Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides released more As than reduction of abiogenic Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides. In contrast, As was immobilized more effectively during reduction of As(V)-loaded biogenic than abiogenic Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides during secondary Fe mineral formation.Norris et al. (2013) aimed to enhance heavy metal removal of filter drain gravel with an iron oxide mineral amendment to increase surface area for heavy metal scavenging in sustainable urban drainage system (SuDS). Experiments showed that amendment-coated and uncoated (control) gravel removed similar quantities of heavy metals; moreover, when normalized to surface area, iron oxide coated gravels (IOCGs) showed poorer metal removal capacities than uncoated gravel. Inspection of the uncoated microgabbro gravel indicated that clay particulates on the surface (a natural product of weathering of this material) augmented heavy metal removal, generating metal sequestration capacities that were competitive compared with IOCGs. Advanced biodegradable and non-toxic organic chelators were synthesized on the basis of the S,Sethylenediamine-disuccinate (S,S-EDDS) ligand by Ullmann et al. (2013). The novel process was developed for the simultaneous removal of both heavy metals and organic pollutants from contaminated soils, sediments or sludge from wastewater. The new chelators were designed to bind various target metal ions, to promote extraction of these ions into organic solvents. The method of continuous flow ultracentrifugation was developed by Zhang et al. (2013) to separate three size fractions (<1 \u00b5m, <0.6 \u00b5m and <0.2 \u00b5m) of the submicron particles from the soil polluted by wastewater and smelter dust respectively. A higher enrichment factor of the metals in the fractions of <1 mu m or less were observed in the soil contaminated by wastewater than by smelter dust. The organic substance in the wastewater and calcite from lime application were assumed to play an important role in the metal accumulation in the fine particles of the wastewater polluted soil.NutrientsExtensive research in urban watersheds has broadened our knowledge about point and non-point pollutant sources, but the fate of nutrients is not completely understood(Carey et al., 2013). The effect of prolonged reclaimed water irrigation is also unknown. Stable isotopes have been used to trace pollutants, but distinguishing sources (e.g., fertilizers, wastewater, etc.) can be difficult.Identifying pollutant sources may aid our understanding of harmful algal blooms because the extent of the relationship between urban nutrient sources and algal blooms is unclear.Further research on the delivery and fate of nutrients within urban watersheds is needed to address manageable water quality impacts.The fate of organics and nitrogen during the biological treatment with MBR and subsequent membrane filtration processes (nano filtration, NE; reverse osmosis, RO) were investigated by Insel et al. (2013) for a landfill leachate. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) removal performances of membrane bioreactor (MBR) were obtained to be around 89% and 85%, respectively. NF/RO post treatment after MBR system was required to increase COD and total nitrogen (TN) removal performances up to 99%. A study was carried out to understand the fate of biodegradable dissolved organic nitrogen (BDON) and bioavailable dissolved organic nitrogen (ABDON) along the treatment trains of a WRRF equipped with an activated sludge (AS) system and a WRRF equipped with a twostage trickling filter (TF) process. Results showed that BDON and ABDON varied significantly within the treatment facility and between the two facilities; from after primary clarification to final effluent, the TF facility removed 65% of BDON and 63% of ABDON while the AS facility removed 68% of BDON and 56% of ABDON. For the TF facility, BDON and ABDON were 62% and 71% of the effluent dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), while they were 26% and 47% of the effluent DON for the AS WRRF. The survey of 60 hybrid constructed wetlands (CWs) from 24 countries reported after 2003 revealed that hybrid constructed wetlands were primarily used in Europe and in Asia while in other continents their use is limited (Vymazal, 2013) with the most commonly used hybrid system as vertical flow (VF) -horizontal flow (HF) constructed wetland. The more detailed analysis revealed that VF-HF hybrid constructed wetlands were slightly more efficient in ammonia removal than other hybrid systems. All types of hybrid CWs were comparable with single VF CWs in terms of NH 4 -N removal rates; on the other hand, CWs with free water surface units removed substantially more total nitrogen as compared to other types of hybrid constructed wetlands. However, all types of hybrid constructed wetlands were more efficient in total nitrogen removal than single HF or VF constructed wetlands.An integrated approach, which combined freshwater microalgae Chlorella zofingiensis cultivation with piggery wastewater treatment, was investigated byZhu et al. (2013). The characteristics of algal growth, lipid and biodiesel production, and nutrient removal wereexamined by using tubular bubble column photobioreactors to cultivate C. zofingiensis in piggery wastewater with six different concentrations. The diluted piggery wastewater with 1900 mg/L COD provided an optimal nutrient concentration for C. zofingiensis cultivation, where the advantageous nutrient removal and the highest productivities of biomass, lipid and biodiesel were presented. Guo, Liu et al. (2013) studied the inhibition of roxarsone on biological phosphorus removal processes for roxarsone-contaminated wastewater treatment, in terms of the removal and rates of chemical oxygen demand (COD), phosphate. Results showed that presence of roxarsone considerably limited the COD removals, especially at roxarsone concentration exceeding 40 mg/L. Additionally, roxarsone inhibited both phosphorus release and uptake processes, consistent with the phosphate profiles during the biological phosphorus removal processes; whereas, roxarsone is more toxic to phosphorus uptake process, than release function. The results indicated that it is roxarsone itself, rather than the inorganic arsenics, inhibit biological phosphorus removal processes within both aerobic and anaerobic roxarsone-contaminated wastewater treatment. Emerging Biological Agents Pathogens. Interest in the analysis and mitigation of the impact of WRRF effluents on receiving water bodies has been increasing particularly the fate of pathogens. The role of a WRRF on the E. coli level at eight nearby marine beaches in Tsuen Wan was studied by Chan et al. (2013) using a 3D deterministic hydrodynamic model. The model precisely predicted the E.coli levels on the beaches which justified that the model is valuable in the interpretation of the complex variation of beach water quality which depends on tidal level, solar radiation and other hydro-meteorological factors therefore can be used in optimization of disinfection dosage and in emergency response situations (Chan et al., 2013). people to characterize and understand infectious risks associated with land application, and to describe the diversity of viruses in human populations. 43 different types of human viruses were identified in sewage sludge. Newly emerging viruses (e.g., Coronavirus HKU1, Klassevirus, and Cosavirus) were highly abundant followed by respiratory viruses, and Enteroviruses (Bibby and Peccia, 2013). A water quality model involving the analysis of several sewer systems (SS) discharging their polluting overflows on the coast in a sensitive marine environment has been developed by De Marchis et al. (2013). The proposed model was tested in a real case study (the Acicastello bay in Italy) where data were available both for SS model and for receiving water body propagation model calibration. The analysis showed a good agreement between the model and monitored data. The integrated model was demonstrated to be a valuable tool for investigating the pollutant propagation and to highlight the most impacted areas (De Marchis et al., 2013). The persistency of human-specific Bacteroidales spp. as promising indicators for fecal contamination in river water during a 3-week agitation was investigated. Water temperature and the presence of predator were identified as the leading factors affecting the fate of Bacteroidales spp. in the environment thus they have to be critically evaluated while identifying fecal pollution sources (Kobayashi et al., 2013) Water Environment Research, Volume 86, Number 10-Copyright \u00a9 2014 Water Environment Federation Stormwater carries a wide spectrum of pollutants including fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). A study investigated the ability of simplified bioinfiltration systems containing quartz sand and iron oxide-coated quartz sand (IOCS) to remove two FIB (Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coil) suspended in synthetic stormwater with and without natural organic matter (NOM) as well as the potential for accumulated FIB to be remobilized during intermittent flow. Results indicated that using geomedia such as IOCS that promote irreversible attachment of bacteria, and maintaining saturated condition, could minimize the mobilization of previous attached bacteria from bioinfiltration systems, although NOM may significantly decrease these benefits (Mohanty et al., 2013). The concentrations of the indigenous pathogen indicators Escherichia coil, Clostridium perfringens and somatic coliphage were tracked for 30 days under stable operation of a two-stage laboratory-scale digester treating a mixture of food waste and blackwater. The study showed that anaerobic digestion reduces E. coli numbers mainly in the thermophilic stage but Clostridium perfringens and somatic coliphage numbers did not change in both stages",

Due to their extensive use, large amounts of antibiotics are released into municipal wastewater due to incomplete metabolism in humans or due to disposal of unused antibiotics, which finally find their ways into different natural environmental compartments.The presence of antibiotics in the environmental media emerged evolution and dissemination of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) which now become an increasing concern about the potential environmental and public health risks. ARB and ARGs have been detected extensively in wastewater samples. Available data show significantly higher proportion of antibiotic resistant bacteria contained in raw and treated wastewater relative to surface water. According to these studies, the conditions in WRRFs proliferate ARB and cause dissemination of ARGs. Moreover, another",

Diversity analysis revealed most of the samples to have similar diversities at phylum level being dominated by Proteobacteria, though a few samples, typically recovered from CIP or doxycycline amended agars were often dissimilar. Arcobacter spp. or E. coli were dominant in the bacterial communities recovered on agars amended with CIP or doxycycline, respectively. These results suggested that Bacterial populations containing multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) in the final treated effluent were possible (Sigala and Unc, 2013). In order to assess hospital effluent (HE) influence on wastewater treatment plant biomass, lab-scale conventional activated sludge systems (CAS) were continuously fed with real HE or urban effluent as a control. The comparative metagenomic analysis of the CAS showed that HE treatment resulted in an increase of class 1 resistance integrons (RIs) and the introduction of Pseudomonas spp. into the bacterial community. HE treatment did not reduce the CAS process performance; nevertheless it increases the risk of dissemination into the environment of bacterial species and genetic determinants (RIs) involved in antibiotic resistance acquisition (Stalder et al., 2013). A study investigated the presence of methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in untreated hospital wastewaters (UHWW), their transmission into the receiving WRRF and survival through the WRRF. 224 S. aureus strains were isolated from UHWW-1, UHWW-2 and its receiving WRRF inlet and post-treatment outlet. Among them, 131 were identified as MRSA strains. 24 of MRSA strains were also vancomycin resistant. Multidrug resistant strains (including MRSA) were more prevalent in hospital wastewaters than in the WRRF. The study also showed the survival of MRSA strains in UHWWs and their transit to the WRRF and then through to the final treated effluent and chlorination stage",

The results suggested that advanced membrane treatment technology is promising for managing public health risks of ARGs in wastewater effluents and that removal may even be enhanced by colloids in realworld wastewaters. Alumina membranes removed ARGs to a greater extent than polyvinylidene fluoride membranes of the same pore size (0.1 \u00b5m)(Breazeal et al., 2013).Water EnvironmentResearch, Volume 86, Number 10-, and ARGs in lagoon outputs, and their potential removal by the treatment wetland prior to release to surface waters in 2012 were investigated. The results of this study indicated that while the treatment wetland may effectively attenuate excess nutrients and remove some micropollutants and bacteria, it does not does not achieve efficient ARGs removal (Anderson et al., 2013). Burch et al. (2013) investigated whether airdrying beds reduce antibiotic resistance gene (ARC) concentrations in residual municipal wastewater solids. Three laboratory-scale drying beds were operated for a period of nearly 100 days. Abundance of total bacteria, fecal bacteria and human fecal bacteria as well as the integrase gene of class 1 integrons and five ARGs representing a cross-section of antibiotic classes and resistance mechanisms (erm(B), sul1, tet(A), tet(W), and tet(X)) were monitored. The results showed that air-drying beds were capable of reducing all gene target concentrations by 1 to 5 orders of magnitude, and the nature of this reduction was consistent with both a net decrease in the number of bacterial cells and a lack of selection within the microbial community (Burch et al., 2013b). In another study, performance of conventional aerobic digestion in reducing the quantity of ARGs in untreated wastewater solids was investigated. A bench scale aerobic digester was fed untreated wastewater solids collected from a full-scale municipal wastewater treatment facility for more than 200 days at a residence time of approximately 40 days. During this time, the quantities of tet(A), tet(W), and erm(B) decreased by more than 90%. In contrast, intl1 did not decrease, and tet(X) increased in quantity by 5-fold. These results demonstrated that aerobic digestion can be used to reduce the quantity of ARGs in untreated wastewater solids, but that rates can vary substantially depending on the reactor design (i.e., batch vs continuous-flow) and the specific ARG (Burch et al., 2013a). The UV disinfection of antibiotic resistant heterotrophic bacteria and their relevant genes in the wastewater of a municipal wastewater treatment plant has been evaluated. Two commonly used antibiotics, erythromycin and tetracycline were selected because of their wide occurrences in regard to the antibiotic resistance problem. UV treatment at a fluence of 5 mJ/cm 2 removed the total erythromycin-and tetracycline-resistance genes by 3.0 \u00b1 0.1 log and 1.9 \u00b1 0.1 log, respectively. UV treatment was effective in reducing antibiotic resistance in the wastewater (Guo et al., 2013b). To understand the effect of UV disinfection on antibiotic resistant bacteria, both total heterotrophic bacteria and antibiotic resistant bacteria (including cephalexin-, CIP-, erythromycin-, gentamicin-, vancomycin-, sulfadiazine-, rifampicin-, tetracycline-and chloramphenicol-resistant bacteria) were examined in secondary effluent samples from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. UV disinfection results in the log reductions of nine types of antibiotic resistant bacteria varied from 1.0 \u00b1 0.1 to 2.4 \u00b1 0.1 for total heterotrophic bacteria, as well as all antibiotic resistant bacteria at a fluence of 5 mJ/cm 2 . On the other hand results indicated that UV disinfection led to enrichment of bacteria with resistance to sulfadiazine, vancomycin, rifampicin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol, while the proportions of cephalexin-, erythromycin-, gentamicin-and CIP-resistant bacteria in the wastewater decreased (Guo et al., 2013a). The effect of UV radiation on antibiotic-resistant E. coil strains was compared with that of chlorination process. Under the investigated conditions, UV disinfection process resulted in a total inactivation after 60 min of irradiation (1.25 x 10 4 \u00b5 W s/cm 2 ) compared to 120 min chlorine contact time (initial chlorine dose of 2 mg/L).",

The catalytic activity of free and immobilized laccase from Trametes versicolor was characterized as a function of pH, temperature and substrate concentration in the reaction medium. The immobilized laccase exhibited a lower affinity for octylphenol than for nonylphenol, but all the other parameters of applicative interest resulted more significant for octylphenol. The study of cell proliferation with MPP89 Water Environment Research, Volume 86, Number 10-Copyright \u00a9 2014 Water Environment Federation cells, a human mesothelioma cell line, and the assay with the YES test indicated the loss of estrogenic activity of the APs solutions after laccase treatment. Another class of EDCs, dithiocarbamates (DTCs), were examined in the study by Padhye et al. (2013) to evaluate their potential to form nitrosamines, highly carcinogenic chemicals, when in contact with various water and wastewater disinfection oxidants. Their results showed that DTCs can serve as nitrosamine precursors, by release of secondary amines through hydrolysis or through reactions with oxidants. The reactions of DTCs with monochloramine and ozone were found to be particularly problematic in the risk of generating nitrosamines, though all four tested oxidants, including free chlorine and chlorine dioxide, formed nitrosamines. The efficacy of two rhizobacteria (Sphingobium fuliginis TIK1 and Sphingobium sp. IT4) of Phragmites australis for the sustainable treatment of water polluted with phenolic EDCs was investigated by Toyama et al. (2013). In sequencing batch reactor experiments using Phragmites in association with TIK1 or IT4, both associations repeatedly removed phenolic EDCs from Phragmites-IT4 associations would be useful for sustainable treatment of polluted waters containing various phenolic EDCs. In the study by Yost et al. (2013) the distribution of steroid hormones, phytoestrogens, and estrogenic activity was thoroughly characterized within the anaerobic waste lagoon of a typical commercial swine sow operation. The isoflavone metabolite equol was by far the predominant phytoestrogen species, with daidzein, genistein, formononetin, and coumestrol present at lower levels while phytoestrogens were often more abundant than steroidal estrogens, but contributed minimally toward total estrogenic activity. Analytes were significantly elevated in the solid phases of the lagoon; although low observed log K OC values suggested enhanced solubility in the aqueous phase, perhaps due to dissolved or colloidal organic carbon. Garcia et al. (2013) performed comparative, analysis of effluent water quality from model decentralized aerobic and septic on-site wastewater treatment systems and a centralized municipal wastewater treatment plant. Parameters used to assess centralized wastewater treatment plant effluent water quality such as whole effluent toxicity and endocrine active substances appeared useful for water quality assessments of decentralized discharges. Authors concluded that aerobic on-site wastewater treatment systems may represent more robust options than traditional septic systems for on-site wastewater treatment in watersheds with appreciable groundwater -surface water exchange. Green et al.

Stable and radiocarbon isotopes (C 13 and C 14 ) were measured throughout the process train in four municipal WRRFs equipped with secondary activated sludge treatment. Isotopic mass balance analyses indicate that 4-14% of influent total organic carbon (TOC) was of fossil origin with concentrations between 6 and 35 mg/L; 88-98% of this was removed from the wastewater. The TOC mass balance analysis suggested that 39-65% of the fossil organic carbon from the influent was incorporated into the activated sludge through adsorption or from cell assimilation while 29-50% is likely transformed to carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) during secondary treatment. The fossil organic carbon fraction in the sludge undergo further biodegradation during anaerobic digestion with a 12% decrease in mass. 1.4-6.3% of the influent TOC consists of both biogenic and fossil carbon was estimated to be emitted as fossil CO 2 from activated sludge treatment alone. Authors pointed out that current greenhouse gas accounting guidelines, which assume that all CO 2 emission from wastewater is biogenic may lead to underestimation of emissions(Law et al., 2013).

Among six PAHs, the content of fluoranthene was the highest, accounting for 62-66% of total PAHs. Throughout the wastewater treatment process, different treatment units exhibited different removal efficiencies for six PAHs. Biological treatment stage and aerated grit chamber appeared to be necessary for effective removal of six PAHs. The removal efficiencies of six PAHs were 73-83% at biological treatment units, and 24-56% at the aerated grit stage, respectively.

They were detected in the 63 (100%) of sewage samples analyzed, 7 (33.3%) of river water and in 10 (23.8%) of air samples collected at the WFFR area. This study demonstrated that despite the treatment, the municipal sewage may be a reservoir of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms and plasmid-mediated antibiotic resistance genes which can be spread in the environment through air.The fate of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and their genes encoding antibiotic resistance in both untreated sewage from hospitals, and in sewage after different stages of treatment was investigated. From among 167 and 147 E. coli strains isolated from hospital effluents and municipal sewage up to 37.1% and 17.7%, respectively, were ESBL-positive.

Overall the results indicated that WRRF discharges may contribute to the spread of ARGs into the environment and may also impact on the bacterial communities of the receiving river(Marti et al., 2013).A study investigated whether fecal coliforms (FC) isolated from surface waters located near a WRRF outflows display TCS resistance and, if so, whether such organisms exhibit increased resistance to antibiotics. Water samples were collected at two streams in Morris County, NJ that receive WRRF effluent: Loantaka Brook and the Whippany River. Water samples were collected at three sites within each location near the WRRF effluent outflow.Abiotic river parameters were measured and FCs were enumerated for each sample. River parameters were analyzed to determine if TCS or antibiotic resistance was correlated to water quality. TCS resistance levels were determined for individual isolates, and isolates were screened against seven classes of antibiotics at clinically relevant levels to assess cross-resistance. Environmental FC isolates resistant to high level TCS included species of Escherichia, Enterobacter, Serratia and Citrobacter. There was no correlation between river water quality and resistance of isolates to TCS which also display multidrug resistance. Presence of isolates not resistant to TCS, but resistant to other antibiotics, were significantly correlated to increased river flow, precipitation, and decreased nutrient levels, suggesting that observed resistance is due to run-off events(Middleton and Salierno, 2013).In another study, the abundance and proportiondynamics of seven antibiotic resistance genes in the wetland media biofilm and in the influent and effluent of parallel horizontal subsurface flow mesocosm cells of a newly established hybrid constructed wetland treating municipal wastewater were examined. The targeted genes encoding resistance to major antibiotic classes such as tetracyclines, macrolides, sulfonamides, penicillins, and fluoroquinolones were quantified. All targeted antibiotic resistance genes were detectable in the tested mesocosm environments, with the tetA, sul1, and qnrS genes being the most abundant in the mesocosm effluents. The abundance of 16S rRNA and antibiotic resistance genes, and the proportion of antibiotic resistance genes in the microbial community, were reduced during the wastewater treatment by the constructed wetland. The results also revealed a relationship between antibiotic resistance genes abundance and the removal efficiencies of NO 2 -N, NH 4 -N, and organic matter (Nolvak et al., 2013). In a study, raw and treated wastewater composite samples were collected from an urban WRRF over 14 sampling dates. Samples were characterized for the occurrence of tetracyclines, penicillins, sulfonamides, quinolones, TCS, arsenic, cadmium, lead, chromium and mercury; antibiotic resistance percentages for tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole, CIP and amoxicillin and the community composition. Variations on the bacterial community structure of the final effluent were significantly correlated with the occurrence of tetracyclines, penicillins, sulfonamides, quinolones and TCS in the raw inflow. Members of the class Epsilonproteobacteria presented positive correlations with those antimicrobials, whereas negative correlations were observed with Beta-and Gamma-proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Antibiotic resistance percentages presented different trends of variation in heterotrophs/enterobacteria and in enterococci, varied over time and after wastewater treatment. Antibiotic resistance was positively correlated with the occurrence of tetracyclines residues and high temperature.
