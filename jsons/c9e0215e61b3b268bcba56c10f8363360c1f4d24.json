In the last decades bats became a possible source for several human infecting agents such as Ebola, SARS and MERS coronaviruses, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus (Wynne and Wang, 2013) . With over 1250 species distributed globally, bats represent the most diverse and species rich taxa among mammals (Teeling et al., 2005) . The zoonotic potential of numerous bat-harbored viruses has been described also in Europe (Kohl and Kurth, 2014) . Additionally, several novel viruses have been detected recently; however, there is no data on their role in association with bat or human diseases (Kemenesi et al., 2014 (Kemenesi et al., , 2015a .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 332, "end": 354, "text": "(Wynne and Wang, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 470, "end": 492, "text": "(Teeling et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 585, "end": 607, "text": "(Kohl and Kurth, 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 757, "end": 779, "text": "(Kemenesi et al., 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 780, "end": 805, "text": "(Kemenesi et al., , 2015a", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The family Caliciviridae comprises small non-enveloped RNA viruses, which are classified in five genera: Vesivirus, Lagovirus, Norovirus, Sapovirus and Nebovirus.

Calicivirus related sequences have been also reported from different bat species in Hong Kong, Hungary and New Zealand (Tse et al., 2012; Kemenesi et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015) . The common characteristic of these bat-derived calicivirus sequences is the phylogenetic divergence from other known members within the family Caliciviridae. The generation of partial or full-length genome sequence data on these recently discovered viruses is crucial to improve viral taxonomy and classification, to develop reliable diagnostic assays and to better understand the molecular mechanisms driving the evolution and host species adaptation of caliciviruses. Human and animal caliciviruses may evolve by accumulation of punctate mutations and by exchange of genetic material via recombination (Giammanco et al., 2013) . Also, interspecies transmission has been documented repeatedly and the origin of some human calicivirus strains may have been triggered by a combination of various evolutionary mechanisms (Smith et al., 1998; Scheuer et al., 2013) .

Likewise, there was 34.7% aa identity and 47.6% similarity, between the template Norwalk virus CP (PDB ID: 1IHM) and the CP of the bat calicivirus strain BtCalV/BS58/ HUN/2013. These identity and similarity values allowed reliable homology modeling and reconstruction of the capsid and virion structure of the two viruses to be made. The mature calicivirus capsid protein has three main domains: S, P1 and P2 ( Fig. 1c and d) . The S (i.e. shell) domain is composed of a canonical eight-stranded \u03b2-barrel structure. This domain forms the inner part of the virion and it has the most conserved structure within caliciviruses. The P1 and P2 subdomains build up the middle and the outer protruding part of the virion, respectively. The hypervariable regions, the primary targets of neutralizing antibodies, are located on the P2 subdomain (Ossiboff et al., 2010) . The basic structure together with the recognized main domains was predicted to be conserved in the two Hungarian bat caliciviruses. However in the P2 region we detected three deletions and an insertion (Fig. 1a and c) in the CP of the bat calicivirus BtCalV/M63/HUN/2013 when compared to the FCV template sequence. In the case of the strain BtCalV/ BS58/HUN/2013, we found two insertions and two deletions on the P2 subdomain ( Fig. 1b and d) with respect to the template structure. Insertions and/or deletions in the P2 domain are common even among caliciviruses of the same genus and/or genotype (Pinto et al., 2012; Medici et al., 2015) . These small structural and sequential differences may play important roles in the P2 subdomain dual functions. The protruding regions of the virion may be involved as antigens in the humoral immune response (Fig. 1e and f) . Furthermore, this variable part of the P2 subdomain may take part in protein-protein interactions between the CP and its functional cell receptor.
