This commentary concurs with Heine and Quintavalla's challenge to the common argument that civil and political rights are of higher importance [1] [2] [3] . But this commentary goes further, in suggesting that before a society begins to prioritize implementation of human rights, it must first secure the basic understanding that the right to health is indeed equally important to civil and political rights. This commentary uses the example of national courts to show how judicial engagement with the right to health has begun to chip away at the boundary between the categories of rights. It suggests that greater interconnection among health and other rights has also made mapping out a hierarchical relationship far more difficult. Thus, before implementation can have any defined order, states must first come to a shared understanding regarding the equal if not greater importance of the right to health.",

Ce commentaire rejoint la contestation par Heine et Quintavalla de l'argument commun selon lequel les droits civils et politiques sont d'une importance sup\u00e9rieure [1] [2] [3] .

The legal recognition of health in this respect is paramount, as it confers a binding duty on states to protect the wellbeing of their people. Stemming from the iconic Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) to the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the right to health is now well established under international human rights law. Yet, in comparison to civil and political rights, the realization of health and other social rights has largely lagged behind. For one, the International Bill of Rights established two separate rights-oriented treaties-one focused on civil and political rights, and the other on social and economic rights-with different approaches to implementation. Under these treaties, civil and political rights are subject to immediate realization. The fulfilment of health, however, is undermined by the fact that it is subject to only progressive realization [4] . Simply put, states have been able to put off the realization of the right by claiming resource constraints, excusing almost any kind of health deprivation. Such matters are compounded by the fact the current international legal order does not provide an adequate framework for how the right to health should be implemented or prioritized in comparison to other rights, particularly civil and political rights.",

Today the right to health and other social rights are well established under international law. Yet in comparison to civil and political rights, the right to health is still considered the \"step child of the human rights movement\" [9] . While states readily accept civil and political rights as fundamental, they have often viewed health and other social rights, which are particularly costly to enforce, as inferior, if even as rights at all. Legal scholars continue to argue that treating needs such as health and housing as \"rights\" \"undermines the enjoyment of individual freedom and distorts the functioning of free markets\" [10] . For Cass Sunstein, for example, recognizing rights such as food, health, and housing would provide an excuse \"to downgrade the importance of civil and political rights\" [10] . In fact, while civil and political rights are inherently justiciable, the ability of judges to adjudicate matters of health is frequently questioned. Aryeh Neier and Dennis Davis, for instance, argue that courts lack the legitimacy and competency to adjudicate health and other social rights. They find that judicial remedies are not always effective in vindicating these rights, and so administrative remedies and the democratic process are better suited to deal with matters of social rights [11, 12] . Thus, they argue that health and other social rights should remain outside the purview of courts altogether. Even when courts have successfully protected the right to health, legal scholars have still felt that the adjudication of health undermines goals of equity.",

Today, the right to health and other social rights are well recognized in countries around the world, including in approximately 67.5% of all constitutions [16] . Where health was once deemed merely an aspirational goal to be worked toward over the long term, it has now translated into a justiciable right, with corresponding legal obligations. In other words, it has become enforceable. Courts, by drawing on the interconnections among different rights, have upheld the fundamental importance of the right to health.",

The right to life has been used to enforce the right to health, but in a growing number of instances the right to health and other social rights have been used to in turn develop civil and political rights. necessary to make them effective for all 2 . In this way the boundaries among \"categories\" of rights have begun to dissolve, and the very meanings of rights themselves have simultaneously expanded. While this greater interconnectedness can help identify shared priorities among health and other rights, namely civil and political rights, as Heine and Quintavalla note, it can also make mapping out a hierarchical relationship far more difficult. Therefore, societies may want to first prioritize the equal importance of health before defining an order to the implementation of rights.",

As the world has become ever more interconnected, with the growth of international trade and mass migration, disease patterns have changed. Public health threats can no longer be addressed through an individual medical lens. Indeed, increased globalization has meant that responses to public health emergencies, such as COVID-19, go beyond purely medical responses to incorporate the various social determinants that can impact population health. To this end, it is crucial to understand health as an inclusive right, extending not only to timely and appropriate health care but also to the underlying determinants of health [17] . Indeed, people's ability to lead healthy lives depends on the availability of sufficient food and clean air. Courts have focused on the greater population's needs when enforcing health and other social rights, recognizing this idea that the right to health vests both individually and collectively. Following this trend, in the context of tobacco control, states have adopted population-based initiatives to create smoke-free laws, raise taxes on cigarettes, and place restrictions on the advertisement of tobacco products in order to ensure wider health outcomes 3 .",
