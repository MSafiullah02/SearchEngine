Because of its potential role in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, it has become important to gather information on this species, and notably to provide a tool to determine the origin of farm and market animals. For this purpose, we studied the genetic variability and the phylogeographic pattern of the masked palm civet Paguma larvata. First, two portions of mitochondrial genes, cytochrome b and the control region, were sequenced for a total of 76 individuals sampled from China, the Indochinese region and the Sundaic region. Results indicated a low genetic variability and suggested a lack of a phylogeographic structure in this species, which do not allow inferring the geographic origin of samples of unknown origin, although it is possible to distinguish individuals from China and the Sundaic region. This low variation is in contrast to the well-marked morphological differentiation between the populations in the Sundaic and Chinese-Indochinese regions. We also used five microsatellite loci to genotype 149 samples from two wild and four farmed populations in China, where the masked palm civet is farmed and where the SARS coronavirus was isolated. These analyses also showed a reduced variability in Chinese civets and showed that farmed populations did not exhibit a lower genetic diversity than wild populations, suggesting frequent introductions of wild individuals into farms.",

They were sampled from two wild and four farm populations, as follows: one wild population from the south-east of Sichuan province north-west of the Liangshan Mountain range (from Xihua University Museum) (n = 17); one wild population from Houhe National Nature Reserve in Hubei (n = 49); four farm populations: Nibin farm in Sichuan province (n = 20); Wufeng farm in Hubei province (n = 23); Quwo farm in Shanxi province (n= 12); Rongxian farm in Guangxi province (n = 28).",

Comparison of alleles' number between different sample sizes and measurement of the allelic richness (i.e. number of alleles independent of sample size) were performed using the program FSTAT v 2.9.3 (Goudet, 2001) . A Hardy-Weinberg (HW) test for each locus in each population and global tests for all populations were performed with Genepop (Raymond & Rousset, 1995) . The program FSTAT was also used to test for linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the polymorphic loci within each species and calculate two different measures of the genetic differentiation over subpopulations (F st , Kimura & Crow, 1964 ; R st , Kimura & Ohta, 1978) as well as inbreeding coefficients (F is ). The sequential Bonferroni correction was applied to derive significance levels for the analysis involving multiple comparisons (Rice & Gaines, 1989) . The genetic divergence between each pair of six palm civet populations based on allele frequencies was calculated according to Nei's D A genetic distance (Nei, Tajima & Tateno, 1983) using Population v 1.2.28 (http://www.cnrs-gif.fr). Genetic distances; trees were also constructed from these genetic distances values using the neighbour-joining clustering (Saitou & Nei, 1987) . Bootstrap re-sampling (n = 1000) was performed to assess the robustness of dendrogram topologies. We also used a clustering method that does not use a spatial prior, as implemented in Structure 2.0 (Pritchard, Stephens & Donnelly, 2000) , to detect the maximum number of populations (K), five independent runs of K= 1-6 were performed with 1 \u00c2 10 6 MCMC repeats and a burn-in of 1 \u00c2 10 6 . K was identified using the maximal values of Ln P (D) (the posterior probability of the data for a given K). Moreover, the program Bottleneck v1.2.02 was used to test for heterozygosity excess and to determine whether allele distributions within populations had been affected by recent changes in the size of the two wild populations (Cornuet & Luikart, 1996; Luikart & Cornuet, 1998) .",

            "text": "The genetic divergence among the studied Pag. larvata populations was quite low (mean pairwise genetic distance c. 0.6%) and did not express any clear phylogeographic signal. The sequenced markers (Cytb and CR) are usually variable in other carnivores (see studies by Davison et al., 2001; Cosson et al., 2007; Tchaicka et al., 2007 ; but see Pe\u00b4rez-Haro et al., 2005) . Comparatively, for a similar CR fragment (HVRI, 346 bp), the variability was lower in the masked palm civet than in closely related species: the binturong Arctictis binturong (Cosson et al., 2007) and the common palm civet Par. hermaphroditus (Patou et al., unpubl. data) . The genetic variability in masked palm civets was also explored in a nuclear gene (nuclear intron 7 of the b-fibrinogen; M.-L. Patou, unpubl. data) , which also showed low variability (mean pairwise genetic distance c. 0.3%). Comparable results were obtained for the complete Cytb gene by J. Chen (unpubl. data) and Masuda et al. (2008) . Moreover, the microsatellite analyses did not contradict these findings. These molecular results were in contrast with the marked morphological differences observed among the masked palm civet populations (Pocock, 1934a,b; G. Veron, pers. obs.) , suggesting unlinked evolutionary mechanisms at the molecular and morphological levels in this species. In fact, the relationships between morphological and molecular evolution have long been debated (e.g. Omland, 1997; Bromham et al., 2002) . An empirical study on rodents (Renaud, Chevret & Michaux, 2007) concluded that correlations between morphological and molecular evolution can be lost when organisms had to answer to an ecological change. In this case, morphological changes may occur rapidly (as observed in specialized taxa; e.g. semi-aquatic genet Genetta piscivora, which exhibits very distinctive morphological features but small genetic distance values to other genets, Gaubert et al., 2004) . In the masked palm civet, two main morphotypes can be distinguished and their distribution limit appears to be located in southern Thailand by the study of a high number of museum specimens (n = 225; from AMNH, New York; BMNH, London; MCZ, Cambridge; MNHN, Paris; USNM, Washington; Institute of Zoology, Beijing; and observation of wild and captive individuals, G. Veron, pers. obs.). Specimens from Malaysia and Indonesia do not have the black and white head pattern, but have a yellowish face, and their body colour is dark brown. Specimens from the other parts of the range display the typical black and white head pattern with a conspicuous white longitudinal band on the nose, and the body colour is lighter, varying from beige, yellowish and grey to light brown. The northern morphotype seems to display much more variability in the colour and head pattern than the southern one. The head and body length of the northern and southern morphotypes does overlap, while Hainan and Taiwan specimens are smaller (head and body length not exceeding 540 and 600 cm, respectively) than specimens from other populations (head and body length up to 790 cm). However, despite the low variability and lack of structure, in our molecular results, none of the Sundaic individuals was found in the China-Indochina clade, suggesting a putative population subdivision. Three haplogroups of masked palm civets were suggested through our analyses:",

On the other hand, Wilcoxon's test did not suggest the occurrence of a bottleneck. The expansion could be a natural northern expansion during Pleistocene as suggested by Tong (2006) , or a more recent expansion due to human activity and notably by moving these animals for the farming and consumption purposes. Civet trade is important (Bell et al., 2004) and farming in China was conducted on a large scale. We found no museum specimens (n = 225) having localities more northerly than 3019'N. Corbet & Hill (1992) mapped the distribution up to 3510'N in China; nowadays, the species is recorded as far north as 3919'N (Zhang, 1997) . The lack of genetic variability and of structure within the Chinese samples does not agree with the division of the Chinese populations into nine subspecies as suggested by Gao (1987) and Jiang et al. (2003) , and, in fact, the morphological evidence does not support this subdivision either.",

The mean F st value of 0.035 from all loci indicated that 96.5% of the genetic variation was explained by the differences among individuals and 3.5% by the differentiation among populations. The greatest genetic differentiation occurred between Shanxi and Sichuan farm populations (F st = 0.132), which indicated that perhaps they originated from two distinct populations. The lowest genetic differentiation occurred between Hubei wild and farm populations (F st =\u00c00.001), which was consistent with the fact that all individuals in Hubei farm were cultured many years ago from the Hubei wild population. There was also reduced differentiation between the Hubei and the Sichuan wild populations (F st = 0.018). We are uncertain whether this value was an accurate measure of the level of genetic differentiation between different civet subspecies. To fully address this issue, however, more rigorous investigation with a greater number of samples from different wild populations will be needed.",

Whether captive breeding was beneficial or harmful for native civet populations is unknown, but this practice may accelerate the crossbreeding and genetic exchange between different populations.",

Indeed, we found no molecular evidence supporting the monophyly of any particular clade matching with a peculiar farm, Chinese province or geographical region, and our results did not support any subspecies subdivision. However, three main haplogroups were put forward while the individuals from Malaysia and Indonesia exhibited a putatively higher genetic diversity. The Chinese farmed populations did not exhibit a lower genetic diversity than the Chinese wild populations, and this probably resulted from bringing in new wild individuals regularly. By these captures, the wild population may be at risk. The discovery of the SARS-like CoV in masked palm civets in the Southern China markets has led to the interdiction of the farming of this species. Whether this has not been replaced by increased local trapping and wildlife traffic is unknown, but should be considered.",
