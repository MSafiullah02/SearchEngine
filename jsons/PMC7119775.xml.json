This virus causes porcine epidemic diarrhea, an enteric disease characterized by acute watery diarrhea and dehydration (DeBouck and Pensaert, 1980). The clinical and pathological symptoms are similar to transmissible gastroenteritis, making it difficult to differentiate between the two infections (Pospischil et al., 1981, Pritchard et al., 1999).",

Isolation and in vitro culture of PEDV using stable cell lines is difficult, and only a few strains have been cultured successfully in cell lines (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988, Kadoi et al., 2002, Kweon et al., 1999). Among the diagnostic methods used, the RT-PCR method is an easy, rapid, specific, and sensitive test for the detection of PEDV in Vero cells and from fecal samples and homogenized intestinal tissues (Kim and Chae, 2002, Song et al., 2006). However, RT-PCR only confirms the presence of the viral genome, and not necessarily the presence of infectious virions. Hence, it may not provide sufficient information for determining the presence of infectious virions. At present, plaque assay and immunofluorescence antibody tests have been used for measuring virus infectivity of PEDV in vitro (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988).",

Within 72 h p.i., several overlapping plaques were observed which made it difficult to determine accurately plaque count (Fig. 3B). Unlike the cell-adapted strain of KPEDV-9, primary isolates of PEDV do not cause cell-to-cell fusion of Vero cells (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988). This was also observed among the primary isolates of PEDV collected from local farms in South Korea. Fig. 3A shows the infectivity of five different primary isolates of PEDV. All 5 isolates (HS-01, HS-02, HS-05, PT-01 and IC-01) did not show typical CPE after infection of Vero cells even after 48 h p.i.

            "text": "FFA offers some advantages for PEDV over the plaque assay technique. One clear advantage is the ability to observe virus infected cells without discernable CPE. Since this method detects viral proteins in infected cells using antibodies that are virus-specific, it is possible to detect the presence of the virus as long as sufficient amount of viral proteins are expressed by the infected cells. In addition, the use of virus-specific antibodies also allows antigenic confirmation of PEDV. Previously, it was reported that the parental strain of PEDV CV777 infects only a small number of cells and fail to cause syncytium formation in Vero cells. CPE was observed only after several passages (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988). However, using the FFA, virus infection can be confirmed 8 h after initial infection of the cells. This allows detection of PEDV as well as measuring the titer of the stock on every passage of the virus. Furthermore, adaptation of the virus to Vero cells may be monitored by observing the size of the foci and comparing the rate of infection and spread of the virus to adjacent cells. Another advantage of FFA is the short incubation period required to detect cells infected with the virus. Unlike plaque assay, the presence of the virus may be confirmed within a few replication cycle of the virus. In contrast, the plaque assay requires several replication cycles of the virus before discernable CPE is observed. Finally, the 96-well microtiter plate scale for cell culture used in FFA provides the advantage of using more replicates and a large number of dilutions for detection and titration of the virus (Ishimine et al., 1987).",
