Evidence suggests that cancer 15 patients are at higher risk of death from COVID-19 16 [1]. Thus, minimizing the potential exposure of this group 17 by reducing hospital visits and admissions, postponing 18 low-risk surgeries, and delaying or reconsidering intra-19venous therapies has to be factored into the risk/benefit 20 discussion for BCa patients.",

Three specific scenarios warrant special 26 attention: (1) initial diagnostic work-up for gross hematu-27 ria; (2) selection of patients with high-risk non-muscle-28 invasive BCa for restaging transurethral resection; and (muscle-invasive BCa on pathology. In addition, the VI-36 RADS score is designed to provide locoregional staging and 37 to predict the likelihood of organ-confined versus locally 38 invasive disease. Consequently, applying VI-RADS at the 39 time of presentation with gross hematuria may aid 40 urologists in minimizing elective procedures and obtaining 41 a radiation-free the evaluation of both T and N staging from 42 a single examination, while providing a prognostic criterion 43 for adjusting oncologic class priority among overwhelmed 44 waiting lists (Fig. 1A). 45 This ability to differentiate non-muscle-invasive from 46 muscle invasive BCa was used to predict BCa upstaging at 47 repeat TURBT in a recent prospective series (area under the 48 receiver operating characteristic curve 0.93, 95% CI 0.87-49 0.97) [4] and therefore VI-RADS has been proposed for 50 avoiding repeat TURBT according to the European Associa-51 tion of Urology guidelines. This may be particularly useful in 52 cases lacking muscularis propria in the specimen or in the 53 setting of a unifocal, small, high-grade Ta/T1 tumor, for 54 which a preoperative VI-RADS score of 1-2 may indicate a 55 low likelihood of tumor understaging and therefore 56 patients may be quickly directed to appropriate adjuvant 57 intravesical therapy for follow-up. This relatively safe 58 approach might minimize potential exposure to COVID-59 19 infection by avoiding a second hospital admission for a 60 surgical procedure that is not devoid of possible complica-61 tions (Fig. 1B).",
