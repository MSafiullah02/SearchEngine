CDI can antagonize calcium, dilate blood vessels, increase blood flow, and improve microcirculation of the heart. It also has the function of inhibiting platelet adhesion, aggregation and release, and improving prostacyclin metabolism, etc. These functions have been documented in large amounts of clinical literature, and CDI has been proven to have reliable therapeutic effects.

Clinically, \u03b2 receptor blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotonin II receptor antagonists, and aldosterone receptor antagonists have been used for left ventricular remodeling treatment after AMI. Chao et al.

The results showed that TSN could significantly reduce the levels of LEDVI and LESVI and increase the levels of LVEF and E/A 2\u20136 weeks after treatment, thus inhibiting the post-AMI enlargement of left ventricular internal diameter at the end of diastasis and left ventricular remodeling. The results demonstrated that TSN had a marked effect on the disease. It was revealed that the main pharmacologic actions of TSN on the cardiovascular system included anticoagulation and antiplatelet aggregation, improving coronary artery collateral circulation, reducing infarcted cardiac muscle area, reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, reducing myocardial consumption of oxygen, and increasing left ventricular work.",

The patients in the treatment group were treated with conventional therapy (mainly benzylpenicillin, low salt diet, symptom relief, etc.), and at the same time, 20 mg of 654-2 and 12\u201316 ml of CDI were, respectively, added into 250 ml of 10 % glucose and administered by intravenous drip, once a day, for 7\u201310 days as one course of treatment. If necessary, the drugs were discontinued for 3 days, then the second course of treatment was performed, and the treatment could be stopped if no effect was obtained. Urine-routine was measured before and after treatment. The patients in the control group were administered with the traditional treatment. The results showed that in the treatment group 27 cases were cured, and among them 21 cases had their symptoms of nephritis all disappear after one course of treatment (spirit and appetite were recovered, edema was dissipated, and urine protein turned negative) and 6 cases had their urine protein turn negative after 2 courses of treatment. Five cases showed improvement, and two cases showed no effect. The average time for edema to subside was 5.37 \u00b1 1.26 days, the average time for blood pressure to return to normal was 3.84 \u00b1 1.26 days, the average time for urine protein to turn negative was 14.57 \u00b1 3.08 days, and the average time of hospitalization was 12.4 days. In the control group, 22 cases were cured, 7 cases improved, and 5 cases showed no effect. The average time for edema to subside was 9.08 \u00b1 2.63 days, the average time for blood pressure to return to normal was 6.48 \u00b1 2.62 days, the average time for urine protein to turn negative was 14.57 \u00b1 3.08 days, and the average time of hospitalization was 14.3 days. CDI has the function of reducing platelet aggregation and adhesion, inhibiting platelet generation, inhibiting blood coagulation, promoting fibrinolysis, improving hemorheology, and so on. The combination of 654-2 with Danshen has the function of dilating the renal arteries, reducing blood viscosity, increasing renal blood flow, improving kidney microcirculation, increasing the flow rate of urine in renal tubules, and preventing and relieving the occlusion of cast and cast-off cells on the distal convoluted tubules, thus realizing the effects of diuresis, subsiding edema, and eliminating proteinuria in a short time. 3 months of follow-up was performed, with affirmative therapeutic effects.",

The patients in the control group were administered with 10 mg of benazepril once a day, and the patients in the treatment group were administered orally with 10 mg of benazepril once a day, and 30 ml of CDI in 250 ml of 5 % glucose injection was administered by intravenous drip once a day. Blood pressure was measured once each day for the patients in the two groups. Two weeks after treatment, if the blood pressure was not reduced to 140/90 mmHg or lower, benazepril would be increased to 20 mg, once a day, treated for 4 weeks. The average blood pressure over 3 days at the end of treatment was used as the blood pressure after treatment, and urinary albumin was measured within 24 h after treatment. Urinary albumin was examined by radiation immunity. The results showed that there was no statistical difference in blood pressure reduction between the two groups after treatment (P > 0.05). There was, however, a statistical difference in the reduction of urine protein between the two groups after treatment (P < 0.05). The results demonstrated that the effect of Danshen and benazepril treatment on urinary albumin was significantly better than that of benazepril alone, and significant therapeutic effects could be obtained by the combination of the two drugs. The method is convenient and the side effects are few, making it an effective method for the treatment of hypertensive renal injury.",
