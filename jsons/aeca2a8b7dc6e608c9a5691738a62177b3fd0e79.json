Taken together these problems indicate that Verity et al.s IFRs should be treated very cautiously when planning. While awaiting actual measurements, we would base IFRs on the DP data, with the Chinese case-fatality data informing the dependence of IFR on age: in supplementary material we provide a crude Bayesian model with its IFR estimates by age. Corresponding population IFR estimates and 95% credible intervals are China: 0.43% (.23,.65), UK: 0.55% (.30,.82); India 0.20% ( .11,.30).

For the Diamond Princess we lump the 80-89 and 90+ age groups into an 80+ group to match the China data, noting that there are no deaths in the 90+ group. We obtained the age of death of the 12 cases from the Diamond Princess Wikipedia page, checking the news reports on which the information was based. One case has no age reported except that he was an adult. Given that there was no mention of a young victim we have assumed that he was 50 or over. We adopt the assumptions of Verity et al. (2020) of a constant attack rate with age, and that there is perfect ascertainment in one age class, but assume that this is the 80+ age group for the DP. The assumption seems more tenable for the DP population than for China, given that 4003 PCR tests were administered to the 3711 people on board, with the symptomatic and elderly tending to be tested first. However given that the tests were not administered weekly to all people not yet tested positive, from the start of the outbreak, and that the tests are not 100% reliable, the assumption is still unlikely to be perfect, which may bias results upwards. Unlike Verity et al. (2020) we do not correct the case data, but adopt a simple model for under-ascertainment by age, allowing some, but by no means all, of the uncertainty associated with this assumption to be reflected in the intervals reported below. We then model a proportion of the potentially detectable cases as being symptomatic, making a second strong assumption that this rate is constant across age classes. This assumption is made because the data only tell us that there were 314 symptomatic cases among 706 positive tests but not their ages, so we have no information to further distinguish age specific under-ascertainment and age specific rates of being asymptomatic. We then adopt a simple model for the probability of death with age (quadratic on the logit scale).",

However we assume that only a proportion of symptomatic cases are detected (at least relative to whatever threshold counted as symptomatic on the DP). Furthermore we are forced to adopt a modified ascertainment model for China, and correct for the difference between this and the DP ascertainment model, within the sub-model for China. We assume the same death rates for symptomatic cases in China, but apply the Verity et al.

Mixing is slow, but 5\u00d710 7 steps, retaining every 2500th sample, gives an effective sample size of about 660 for \u03b4, the slowest moving parameter. We discarded the first 2000 retained samples as burn in, although diagnostic plots show no sign that this is necessary. Posterior predictive distribution plots are shown in Figure 2 . We note the problems with young Chinese detected cases, although even the most extreme mismatch only corresponds to a factor of 2 IFR change, if reflecting incorrect numbers of actual cases. In older groups the model cases are a little high on average, but not by enough to suggest much change in IFR. These mismatches might be reduced by better models for the ascertainment proportion by age. Figure 1 shows the posterior predictive distribution for total Diamond Princess deaths with the actual deaths as a thick red bar. The median and credible intervals for the IFR as percentages in various groups are in Table 1 . They show different estimates of this crucial quantity compared to Verity et al. (2020) , again emphasising the urgent need for statistically principled sampling data to directly measure prevalence, instead of having to rely on complex models of problematic data with strong built in assumptions.
