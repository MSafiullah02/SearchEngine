At the same time, it is also one of the main pollutants of cattle-derived biological products (Yarnall and Thrusfield, 2017). Due to the complexity of disease pathogenesis, there is no effective means to control or treat BVDV infection (Quinet et al., 2016).

The RNA genome of BVDV is approximately 12.5 kb, consisting of a single large open reading frame with a UTR on both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends and encodes a polymerized protein that is then processed by host and viral proteases into the capsid protein, three envelope glycoproteins (Erns, E1, E2) and seven or eight non-structural proteins (NSPs) comprising Npro, P7, NS2/3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B (Collett et al., 1991; Tautz et al., 1997). The first four proteins are structural, whereas the rest are nonstructural and function in viral assembly, replication, and host immune evasion. NS5B, which is located at the carboxyl terminus of the polyprotein, is highly conserved among pestiviruses, and has been confirmed to possess RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity, and is responsible for transcription and replication of the viral genome (Zhong et al., 1998). Due to these unique characteristics, NS5B is an ideal target for the development of antiviral drugs against BVDV.",

            "text": "Single-domain antibodies, also known as nanobodies (Nbs), are derived from the heavy chain antibody variable region (VHH) in camelids and considered as the smallest available intact antigen-binding fragments (Hamers-Casterman et al., 1993; Muyldermans et al., 2009). Nanobodies have desirable properties such as small volume (15 kDa), good antigen binding performance, strong tissue penetration and high stability (Zou et al., 2015); these attractive features make them beneficial for immunoassays and therapeutic applications. In addition, for the majority of nanobodies, their intrinsic stability is sufficient for proper folding and intracellular function (Rothbauer et al., 2006). For example, ALX-0171, a trivalent nanobody that binds fusion proteins on the surface of RSV, thereby inhibiting viral replication, is a novel, inhaled biotherapeutic; it is in development for the treatment of RSV infections in infants and is currently in a clinical phase III trial (Detalle et al., 2016; Larios Mora et al., 2018). In addition to some nanobodies as drugs for clinical applications, some studies have referred to the antiviral effects of specific nanobodies in vitro. For example, a novel nanobody Nb25 was found to effectively block duck HAV replication by targeting a conserved B cell epitope of this virus (Xue et al., 2019). Another nanobody NbMS10, which targets the MERS-CoV receptor-binding region significantly abrogates virus replication via its neutralization activity (Zhao et al., 2018). Further, Intracellularly-expressed Nb6 was found to potently suppress porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome replication (Liu et al., 2015). Nevertheless, there have been no reports on the use of nanobodies for antiviral therapy against BVDV to date.",

Next, these 116 colonies were sequenced and eight different NS5B-specific nanobodies were eventually screened based on the amino acid sequence classification of the antibody CDR3 hypervariable region; these were named Nb1, Nb5, Nb20, Nb45, Nb54, Nb60, Nb100, and Nb114. The deduced amino acid sequences were aligned against the human VH sequence, numbering and CDRs followed the methods described by Kabat et al (Kabat and Wu, 1991). The data in Fig. 2\nshow that except for Nb60, the other seven nanobodies had typical hydrophilic amino acid substitutions in the FR2 region. Interestingly, Nb60 also displayed notable reactivity against NS5B. In addition, iELISA results indicated that all eight nanobodies could specifically bind the NS5B recombinant protein, but did not cross-react with PRRSV-NSP4 recombinant protein (Fig. 3\nA). PRRSV NSP4 recombinant protein was expressed and purified using the same vector pET-28a and method used for BVDV NS5B. This protein also contained a 6\u00d7His-Tag, excluding the possibility that these nanobodies might recognize the 6\u00d7His region. Of all nanobodies, Nb1, Nb45 and Nb100 displayed the highest affinity (Fig. 3B). Based on these results, these three nanobodies were selected for subsequent experimental studies and the negative nanobody Nb35 was selected simultaneously as a negative control.",

Next, to determine whether the intracellular expression of nanobodies is cytotoxic, cell proliferation assays, using recombinant MDBK-NbsEGFP cell lines and wild-type MDBK cells were performed and growth curves were plotted over time. The results showed that the stable expression of intracellular nanobodies in MDBK-NbsEGFP cell lines were not cytotoxic, and no remarkable differences were observed between recombinant and the wild-type cells (Fig. 4C). Since pre-experimental results implied that the MDBK-Nb100EGFP cell line had no antiviral activity and the MDBK-Nb45EGFP cell line showed weaker antiviral activity, but the MDBK-Nb1EGFP cell line has strong antiviral effects (Fig. S1), the MDBK-Nb1EGFP cell line was utilized eventually to further explore the antiviral effect of nanobodies.",

However, despite their huge potential for development, monoclonal antibodies still have apparent limitations, such as complex structure, large molecular weights, high development and production costs, which limit their applications in related fields. With the development of genetic engineering technology, the emerging nanobody has greatly improved antibody performance, with its unique advantages such as small size (15 kDa), high specificity and affinity, and recognition of specific antigenic epitopes (Dmitriev et al., 2016; Hassanzadeh-Ghassabeh et al., 2013). In addition, according to a previous report, nanobodies are more soluble due to typical hydrophilic amino acid substitutions (Vu et al., 1997); thus, we speculate that the substitution of hydrophilic amino acid to hydrophobic amino acid in this study might further increase the hydrophilicity of NS5B-specific nanobodies (Fig. 2).",

NS5B has been shown to possess RdRp activity and plays a pivotal role in the transcription and replication of the BVDV genome (Choi et al., 2004). Therefore, NS5B-specific nanobodies were screened using phage display in this study to explore their anti-BVDV effect. Here, to facilitate this study, stable cell lines were generated by first packaging the lentivirus and then transducing it into MDBK cells, which not only avoided problems associated with individual transfections but also resulted in stable and efficient expression of Nbs fusion proteins. Further, to clarify that nanobodies were successfully delivered to the cells, a C-terminal EGFP was fused to the Nbs via an IgA-hinge linker to act as a marker and facilitate Co-IP detection (Fig. 4, Fig. 6). It has been reported that fluorescent protein-nanobody fusion proteins of the HIV-1 capsid protein can recognize and dynamically trace HIV-1 morphogenesis in living cells, and this novel fluorescent biosensor provides a robust tool for cell-based HIV research (Helma et al., 2012). This suggests that the NS5B-specific nanobodies identified here might also have the potential to act as a tool for the direct and dynamic visualization of NS5B in BVDV-infected living cells. Results of subsequent virus infection experiments showed that a novel nanobody, named Nb1, which specifically targets BVDV NS5B, significantly abolished viral replication (Fig. 5, Fig. 6), demonstrating that intracellularly-expressed nanobodies can suppress BVDV infection in vitro.",

Unexpectedly, even though all three Nbs showed similar in vitro affinities for NS5B, the degree of inhibition of viral replication was completely different. Nb100 had no antiviral activity and Nb45 showed weaker antiviral activity, whereas Nb1 exhibited a strong antiviral effect (Fig. S1). We speculate that this is because different Nbs might bind different NS5B epitopes, and that Nb1, but not Nb100, could bind the key epitope of NS5B, inhibiting its RdRp activity and thus exerting strong antiviral effects. The NS5B protein is mainly distribute in the cytoplasm of BVDV-infected cells, and the replication and transcription of viral genes also primarily occurs in the cytoplasm, implying that Nbs might exert antiviral activity mainly by targeting NS5B protein in the cytoplasm. Surprisingly, our IFA and Western blotting results both clearly indicated that the Nbs were mainly distributed in the nucleus, and only a small portion were identified in the cytoplasm (Fig. S2). In view of these inconsistent results inconsistency in the subcellular localization of NS5B protein and Nbs, the anti-viral molecular mechanism of Nbs needs to be further researched, and we are currently working on this.",

This provides an ideal target for the development of anti-BVDV drugs. Due to advantages that are unmatched by traditional antibodies, Nbs have broad value for clinical application (Pardon et al., 2014; Siontorou, 2013). However, The biggest problem associated with intracellular antibodies is the delivery of related expression genes into cells, while several possible strategies have been developed to overcome this problem, such as nanobody gene delivery into cells via an intrabody gene therapy delivery strategy (Southwell et al., 2009) and a trans-activating transduction (TAT) peptide Nb6 fusion to promote protein entry into cells (Wang et al., 2019).

MDBK, MDBK-Nb35EGFP and MDBK-Nb1EGFP cell lines were infected with BVDV at MOIs of 0.1 and 1 for 48 hpi. BVDV-induced CPEs were monitored under an inverted microscope (A). The scale bar indicates 250 \u03bcm. BVDV production was analyzed based on TCID50 values (B). BVDV-NS5B protein levels were measured by western blotting with \u03b1-tubulin as the control (C). Cell viability was assessed using the CCK-8 method at 48 hpi (D). Interaction between intracellularly expressed Nb1 and BVDV-encoded NS5B in MDBK cells infected with BVDV. MDBK-Nb1EGFP and MDBK-Nb35EGFP cell lines were infected with 1 MOI of BVDV, and cells were collected at 72 hpi. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by western blotting using a mouse anti-GFP monoclonal antibody and a mouse anti-NS5B polyclonal antibody (E). Data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD representative of three independent experiments. p values were calculated using ANOVA. Significant differences, as compared to control values are denoted as ***(p < 0.001).",
