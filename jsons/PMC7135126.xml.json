Estimates of the number of cases of infectious diarrhea each year in the United States range from 25 million to 99 million, resulting in 2.2 million hospital visits.24, 29, 47, 53, 69 Children less than 5 years old are particularly susceptible to infectious diarrheal disease for a variety of epidemiologic and immunologic reasons, producing greater than 20 million cases that result in approximately 200,000 hospitalizations and 400 deaths.33, 46, 69, 72 Much of the childhood mortality is related directly to the dehydration associated with infectious diarrheal disease.48\n",

These organisms or their toxins primarily affect the small intestine rather than the colon.

Briefly, laboratory approaches recommended in these guidelines to improve cost-effectiveness of stool culture include selective testing for the most likely pathogen; discouraging the submission of stool specimens from patients who have been hospitalized for greater than 3 days, unless overriding circumstances prevail (exceptions include hospital outbreaks, advanced age, comorbid disease, neutropenia, and HIV infection); specific examination for C. difficile or its toxins in appropriate settings for patients who have been hospitalized for greater than 3 days; and use of screening tests, such as fecal leukocytes or fecal lactoferrin, for possible inflammatory or invasive diarrhea.

A simple, rapid, and useful test for acute infectious diarrhea is microscopic examination for fecal leukocytes in stool. Loeffler's methylene blue and Gram stain may be used for direct microscopic examination of fecal specimens for the presence of fecal leukocytes. Fecal leukocytes may be observed after mixing equal amounts of methylene blue and fecal suspension on a slide and examining using a light microscope at 400 times magnification.46 Fecal leukocyte evaluation is considered positive if 3 or more leukocytes are seen per high-power field in 4 or more fields.46, 89 A positive examination indicates an inflammatory condition in the colon, not necessarily associated with an infection. Fecal leukocytes generally are observed in patients with salmonellosis, shigellosis, campylobacteriosis, EIEC, EHEC, staphylococcal enterocolitis, Entamoeba histolytica, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and pseudomembranous colitis, among others.69, 72Gram-stained smears of stool may be useful in determining the presence of fecal leukocytes but offer some disadvantages. Slides can be difficult to interpret, smear thickness and staining are difficult to standardize, cells deteriorate quickly, and specimens must be examined within minutes of collection to be accurate. Because the sensitivity of direct microscopic examination is 60% to 70%, the absence of fecal leukocytes does not exclude enteric pathogens.93\n",

S. dysenteriae type I produces an exotoxin that has enterotoxic and neurotoxic actions. Direct examination of fresh dysenteric stools may show a cellular exudate with erythrocytes and numerous leukocytes.27, 46 The definitive diagnosis of shigellosis is made by stool culture using selective and nonselective media. Selective differential media, such as XLD, SS, deoxycholate-citrate, Hektoen enteric (HE), and MAC agars, are well suited for the isolation of Shigella from stool specimens. DNA hybridization assays and DNA probes specific for invasion genes have been used for the diagnosis of shigellosis,14, 38, 41 but these assays are not readily available in clinical laboratories.

ETEC and EPEC are important causes of diarrhea in infants, and ETEC is a primary cause of traveler's diarrhea.22, 28, 61 Children less than 2 years old have a much higher risk of acquiring traveler's diarrhea. Diarrheagenic E. coli can produce watery, cholera-like diarrhea (ETEC), dysentery-like symptoms (EIEC), and grossly bloody diarrhea (EHEC). E. coli O157:H7, one of the common EHEC serotypes, was described first in 1982 and produces a Shiga-like toxin that causes sporadic cases and outbreaks of hemorrhagic colitis.85 The organism is associated with severe hemolytic-uremic syndrome, especially in children (see articles by Ramaswamy and Jacobson, page 611, and Tarr and Neill, page 735). One of the major distinguishing cultural characteristics of this serotype is that about 80% of isolates do not ferment d-sorbitol. The medium of choice for isolation of this organism is sorbitol-MacConkey (SMAC) agar. Agar or broth medium containing the substrate 4-methylumbellifery1-\u03b2-d-glucuronide (MUG) can be used for detection of glucuronidase produced by E. coli. About 92% of E. coli O157:H7 isolates lack the enzyme \u03b2-glucuronidase and do not produce a fluorescent product when observed with long-wave UV light. Latex agglutination can be used as a rapid test for E. coli serogroup O157 detection in primary cultures. The MUG assay, sorbitol-fermentation testing, and agglutination in E. coli O157 antiserum are useful tests for screening for cytotoxigenic strains of O157.68 Methods for the recovery and detection of other pathogenic E. coli are not routinely available.",

George et al44 was the first to describe a selective medium (cycloserine-cefoxitin-fructose agar [CCFA]) for recovery of C. difficile from stool; this formulation is in common use today. Direct detection of a C. difficile-associated antigen, glutamate dehydrogenase, in stool is another approach in documenting presence of the organism. Direct detection of C. difficile toxins responsible for clinical disease has become more popular because neither the culture method nor the marker antigen test distinguishes toxigenic from nontoxigenic strains, and cultures require at least 48 hours.3, 71\n",

Many EIA kits detecting toxin A, toxin B, or both are commercially available and vary considerably in sensitivity (34% to 100%) and specificity (88% to 100%). EIA and LA kits are available for detection of C. difficile glutamate dehydrogenase, although positive results do not differentiate toxigenic from nontoxigenic (i.e., colonizing) strains. Negative results with simultaneously performed glutamate dehydrogenase and toxin A tests reliably rule out the possibility of C. difficile-associated disease (negative predictive value, 99.6%).11 Despite availability and rapidity of EIA C. difficile antigen and toxin tests, the cytotoxin B tissue culture assay is the most specific test for detection of toxigenic C. difficile.",

Most of the more recently described protozoal agents producing diarrhea are not detectable by these methods, requiring additional specific stains or EIA methods.
