However, IFN-\u03b1 alone or in combination with ribavirin often leads to a range of side effects, and the sustained virological response rate after combination therapy of pegylated IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin is <50%, particularly for those infected with HCV genotype 1 or 4.2 Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of alternative anti-HCV agents, especially for patients who do not respond to IFN-\u03b1 therapy.",

The viral genome consists of one long open reading frame (ORF) flanked by untranslated regions (UTRs) at both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the genome. The ORF encodes a single polyprotein of 3010 amino acids that is proteolytically processed by cellular and viral proteases into \u226510 polypeptides corresponding to the viral structural and non-structural (NS) proteins. The 65 kDa HCV NS5B protein has RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity and is a key player in HCV RNA replication.3 RdRp activity is not present in mammalian cells, offering the opportunity to identify selective inhibitors of the HCV RdRp. The crystal structure of HCV NS5B resembles a right hand shape with finger, thumb and palm domains similar to other polymerases.4 Over the last decade, researchers have begun developing nucleoside and non-nucleoside analogue inhibitors, which target the active site in the palm subdomain and the allosteric sites in the thumb subdomain of NS5B.5",

To screen the library, we performed an in vitro RdRp assay using recombinant NS5B. The in vitro RdRp assay was carried out in a FlashPlate coated with streptavidin using poly(A) RNA/biotinylated oligo(U)12 as a substrate in the presence of 10 \u03bcM of each library compound. As shown in Figure 1(b), the natural MOP inhibited NS5B activity by \u223c28% at 10 \u03bcM concentration. In an attempt to improve the inhibitory potency, we produced various AADs of MOP in which the aromatic ring oxygen of MOP was changed to different amino acids (Figure 1a). These derivatives were tested for RdRp inhibitory activity. Among the resulting MOP AADs, we found that derivatives containing Asn, Lys, Phe, Gly, Ala, Val, Leu or Ile side chains had greater inhibitory potency (up to \u223c45%) than the parent MOP. However, the activity was still \u223c50-fold lower than that of benzothiadiazinylquinone (42% inhibition at 200 nM), a potent HCV inhibitor designed to target the palm site of the NS5B polymerase.25 Considering the novel potential of these microbial secondary metabolites as anti-HCV agents, we proceeded to characterize their structure\u2013function relationships.\n",

R-1 cells were treated with 10 \u03bcM of each MOP AAD for 48 h and then the remaining steady-state level of NS5B protein was determined by western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 2(a), among the selected group of MOP AADs that inhibited NS5B RdRp activity in vitro, Lys, Phe, Val, Leu and Ile derivatives also inhibited HCV replication in Huh7 cells, which harbour a HCV subgenomic replicon RNA. Treatment of cells with the positive control, IFN-\u03b1 (100 IU/mL), or the MOP AAD both reduced the NS5B protein levels to different degrees. IFN-\u03b1 reduced NS5B by 75% while the reductions for the AADs were: Lys 30%; Phe 39%; Val 38%; Leu 45%; and Ile 35%. In the conditions of this assay, none of the MOP compounds significantly affected Huh7 cell proliferation (at most <10% at 10 \u03bcM concentration), as assessed by a colorimetric MTT assay (data not shown). Notably, in contrast to the in vitro RdRp assay results, the parental MOP compound did not significantly reduce HCV protein expression levels in the Huh R-1 cells, which might be due to its lower affinity to the RdRp or inability to pass through the plasma membrane.\n",

The HCV RNA levels were decreased by 38%\u201353% by treatment with 10 \u03bcM of each of the MOP derivatives (Figure 2b). We finally selected MOP Phe, Val and Leu derivatives to further characterize the mechanism of HCV inhibition in HCV-infected cells. We used the HCV infection system established with the genotype 2a HCV clone JFH1, which yields infectious HCV virus from Huh7 or Huh7-derived cell lines.17 Because combination therapy with pegylated IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin is the current standard therapy for the treatment of HCV infection,26 we also sought to evaluate the potential of the MOP AADs to act in combination with IFN-\u03b1. HCV-infected Huh7 cells were treated with 10 \u03bcM of each MOP AAD alone or in combination with IFN-\u03b1 (100 IU/mL) for 72 h and the HCV genome level was analysed by real-time qRT\u2013PCR. As shown in Figure 3(a), HCV RNA abundance was decreased by 52%\u201358% when the virus-infected cells were treated with 10 \u03bcM of the Phe, Val or Leu MOP derivatives. Combination of IFN-\u03b1 (100 IU/mL) with the Phe, Val or Leu MOP AADs (10 \u03bcM) reduced the HCV RNA levels by 77%, 82% or 88%, respectively. The MOP-Leu derivative showed the greatest reduction of HCV RNA when combined with IFN-\u03b1 and inhibited HCV replication in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 value of 8.9 \u03bcM (Figure 3b). We also monitored viral NS5A and NS5B protein expression by western blot analysis. As shown in the Figure 3(b) inset, the MOP-Leu derivative reduced NS5A and NS5B expression in a dose-dependent manner. Lastly, the compound displayed no significant cytotoxicity at concentrations up to 50 \u03bcM (<20% decrease of cell viability at 50 \u03bcM), as assessed by the MTT cell viability assay (Figure 3c). Together, these results demonstrate that MOP AADs had antiviral activity against both genotype 2a HCV (from the Huh7 infection model) and genotype 1b HCV (from the subgenomic replicon system in Figure 2), and suggest their potential as novel HCV antiviral drugs when used in combination with IFN-\u03b1.\n",

Lastly, two hydrogen bonds between oxygen atoms of a carboxylate group on the inhibitors and Arg501 and Lys533 side chains on NS5B were also observed, as with the carboxylic acid moiety of the reference compound. The location of this inhibitor-binding site suggests that the binding of these inhibitors could interfere with a conformational change essential for HCV NS5B polymerase activity.29",

To assess the possibility that MOP AADs may inhibit HCV replication by inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis, we first performed in vitro HMG-CoA reductase assays in HCV replication-supporting Huh7 cells. As shown in Figure 5(b), MOP derivatives (the Phe, Val and Leu derivatives) did not have any observable HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity, even at a high concentration (10 \u03bcM), while pravastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, significantly decreased the enzyme activity at a concentration of 1 \u03bcM.\n",

This result prompted us to further investigate whether the MOP AADs block HCV replication by inhibiting the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway downstream of mevalonate. To test this possibility, we examined whether the increase in HCV replication by the addition of mevalonate can be suppressed by the MOP AADs. Huh7 R-1 cells, which harbour an HCV subgenomic replicon, were incubated with 10 mM mevalonate in the absence or presence of 10 \u03bcM of the Phe, Val or Leu MOP AADs. After 2 days, the cells were harvested and HCV subgenomic RNA levels analysed by real-time qRT\u2013PCR. As shown in Figure 5(c), the HCV RNA level increased by \u223c37% with the addition of mevalonate; however, the mevalonate-induced increase was completely blocked by MOP AAD treatment. Moreover, the increase in intracellular cholesterol caused by mevalonate supplementation was also inhibited by MOP AAD treatment and the cholesterol levels were reduced to the level of mock-treated cells (Figure 5d). Together, these results suggest that in addition to a direct inhibition of NS5B RdRp activity, these MOP AAD compounds also inhibit HCV replication by interfering with the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway downstream of the HMG-CoA reductase step.",

The MOP AADs failed to dock to the other three NNI sites and did not show any common binding patterns shared with previously reported inhibitors known to bind to NNI-binding sites I, III and IV (data not shown). The pharmacophore of HCV NS5B NNI binding to thumb subdomain site II is composed of the hydrogen-bond interaction sites (Arg501 and Lys533) and a hydrophobic cavity, which appear to be occupied by a carboxylic acid residue and prophenyl residue of MOP AADs, respectively. Among those two predicted interacting parts of the MOP AADs, the carboxylic acid residue seems to be more critical for NS5B inhibition, since the MOP lacking this carboxylic acid residue showed comparably lower NS5B inhibitory activities and no detectable anti-HCV activity in HCV-replicating cells. Further, molecular docking simulations showed that the parental MOP compound did not make hydrogen bonds with Arg501 and Lys533. The NNIs binding to this site, like the inhibitors binding to the NNI-binding site I on the upper section of the HCV NS5B thumb domain, are likely to prevent the polymerase from adopting the closed conformation required for productive polymerization during elongation.29",

However, further studies are needed to determine whether these MOP derivatives provide a novel scaffold binding to the thumb subdomain allosteric sites of NS5B from other genotypes as well. In addition to genotype diversity, the emergence of resistant mutants is another obstacle for the development of NNIs. For instance, treatment of patients with NNI site II inhibitors, such as filibuvir and VCH759, in clinical trials resulted in the selection of resistant mutants with mutations at Leu419, Met423 and Ile482 of NS5B.35,38,39 Our molecular docking simulation predicted that Leu489/Ile482/Met423 is also involved in the binding of the selected MOP AADs to the site II hydrophobic pockets.

In particular, cholesterol biosynthesis was proposed as an integral part of HCV RNA replication, which occurs on lipid rafts.31,40 In addition, HCV entry through the low-density lipoprotein receptor and viral assembly occurring on the surface of lipid droplets are also linked to cholesterol biosynthesis.41,42 Accordingly, various inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase have been shown to suppress HCV replication.33,43 Our results suggest that the anti-HCV activity of MOP AADs (the Phe, Val and Leu derivatives) might also be partially due to their ability to interfere with the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway. The key enzyme in the mevalonate\u2013cholesterol pathway, HMG-CoA reductase, was not inhibited by the MOP derivatives. However, the increased HCV RNA levels induced by mevalonate supplementation were inhibited by the MOP AADs. It was previously suggested that geranylgeranylation of the host factor FBL2 is required for targeting of HCV NS5A to the intracellular membranous structure to form the RNA replicase complex.43 This previous study also demonstrated that the addition of cholesterol failed to rescue HCV RNA replication in the presence of lovastatin.43 Thus, it is likely that the MOP AADs prevented HCV replication in part by blocking the generation of geranylgeranyl or its precursors, since the HCV NS5A\u2013FBL2 interaction required for HCV replication depends on geranylgeranylation of FBL2.43 Of note, the increased intracellular cholesterol level in the mevalonate-treated cells decreased upon treatment with the MOP AADs. Therefore, MOP AADs appear to be capable of inhibiting the step(s) involved in converting mevalonate to cholesterol or the enzyme converting farnesyl diphosphate to geranylgeranyl diphosphate.",

A double-hit strategy, including inhibition of HCV RdRp activity and interference with the mevalonate synthetic pathway, to inhibit HCV amplification may provide the basis for successful antiviral therapy using the MOP AADs derived from this microbial secondary metabolite. The selected AADs of MOP potentiated the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b1, suggesting that combination therapy with IFN-\u03b1 or other drugs may offer an alternative strategy for controlling HCV replication.",
