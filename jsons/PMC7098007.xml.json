This is important because the source of leadership has critical implications for pandemic vaccination policies. In contrast to other disasters, where the logic of political survival usually incites executives to choose a politically precautionary response strategy, public health agencies follow their expert judgments and practice in opting for pandemic responses that could either follow a precautionary or a proportional strategy. Hence, national pandemic responses such as vaccine purchases and distribution become highly divergent, depending upon which strategy health authorities use.",

The comparative approach is based on a most-similar case design where different crisis responses take place in otherwise similar socio-political contexts (Przeworski and Teune, 1970; Landmann, 2008). The countries have been purposely selected to constitute a group of critical cases (Eckstein, 1975; George and Bennett, 2005) that have strategic importance: if the political theory of survival fails to predict government responses under the most optimal of conditions (mature and rich democracies), then the same is likely to also hold true in countries with less favorable conditions where centralism, patronage, corruption and red tape are prevalent. In these countries politicians could be capable of both ignoring their popularity among voters as well as any advice from the independent (external or internal) expert agencies.

In terms of disaster responses, the countries\u2019 emergency and evacuation policies to the 2004 Tsunami were also remarkably similar. Due to the many vacationing Scandinavians in Thailand, the Tsunami was the most deadly disaster due to a shock occurring in nature for more than a century for both Sweden (543 fatalities) and Denmark (46 fatalities) (EM-DAT, 2012). The disaster responses were all based on direct Prime Ministerial involvement, and the evacuation efforts were harmonized across the Scandinavian countries (\nPolitiken, 2005b). All three governments were faced with public criticism for responding too hesitantly, and the disaster responses were subsequently subject to much debate and independent inquiries (\nPolitiken, 2005a). With regard to pandemic responses, the institutional setups are also very similar: the countries have strong agencies of pandemic prevention and a great deal of flexibility with regard to the number of vaccines they can purchase (\nKristeligt Dagblad, 2009). During the 2009 pandemic, however, the Danish Government pursued a much more restrictive vaccination policy based on risk group coverage rather than the universal coverage pursued by the other Scandinavian countries (see Table I).",

Since its successful handling of polio using mass vaccination in the 1950s, the CDC has been the center of epidemic (and pandemic) response (Etheridge, 1992). To an extent, the executive branch has been particularly discredited as a leader of responses to epidemic influenza due to past mismanagement (Neustadt and Fineberg, 1978). Hence, history suggests that public health emergencies are bureaucratized rather than politicized in the USA. As in Scandinavia, this stands in stark contrast to other disasters, such as the hurricane flooding of New Orleans in 2005 (Katrina), where peak-level, executive (presidential and/or departmental) leadership has been the focus for public guidance and attention (Gerber and Cohen, 2008; Preston, 2008).",

Directly strengthening expert communities in countries with weak democratic institutions (e.g. through agency support and training) could boost the likelihood of a more scientific response to pandemics.
