The first case reported in cattle was in 1971 (Panciera et al., 1971). Now, bovine cryptosporidiosis is considered as one of the major causes of neonatal calf diarrhoea characterized by emission of yellow watery stool, progressive dehydration, growth retardation and possibly death (de Graaf et al., 1999). In contrast, asymptomatic infection commonly occurs in yearling heifers and mature cows (Sant\u00edn et al., 2008). In cattle, Cryptosporidium has become a concern not only because of the direct economic losses associated with the infection, but also from a public health perspective because of the potential for environmental contamination with oocysts and especially contamination of water, an important source of cryptosporidiosis outbreaks as recently reviewed by Baldursson and Karanis (2011). Currently, no drug therapy is available and the high resistance of Cryptosporidium oocysts in the environment makes cryptosporidiosis difficult to control (Cacci\u00f2 and Pozio, 2006).",

A chronological sequence of species from birth to adulthood has been suggested by some authors, with C. parvum being predominant in pre-weaned dairy calves (<2 months), C. ryanae and C. bovis occurring mainly in weaned animals and C. andersoni becoming dominant in adult cows (Sant\u00edn et al., 2004, Sant\u00edn et al., 2008, \u0160lapeta, 2006, Fayer, 2010, Xiao, 2010). For other authors the succession according to the age of dairy calves varies according to geographic area and management system adopted (Feng et al., 2007, Geurden et al., 2007, Silverl\u00e5s and Blanco-Penedo, 2012). In Belgium, Hungary and the USA, the most prevalent species in young dairy calves (<1 month) was C. parvum (Geurden et al., 2007, Plutzer and Karanis, 2007, Sant\u00edn et al., 2008), whereas in other countries including Sweden, India and China, C. bovis was shown to be the most prevalent species in young dairy calves (<1 month) (Feng et al., 2007, Silverl\u00e5s et al., 2010).",

In addition, a high level of excretion was observed in the youngest oocyst-excreting calves (3\u20139 days) of the third cohort (mean oocyst excretion: 2.5 \u00d7 106\n opg). Mean oocyst excretion were significantly different in each age group between years (p\n < 0.001) (Fig. 1).",

(2008) in dairy calves. The average levels of excretion of Cryptosporidium sp. were also similar to what was reported in dairy calves by Silverl\u00e5s et al. (2010). However, when including a pluri-annual approach, we observed that the peak of excretion could occur at different ages depending on the year of sampling. This peak occurred between 17 and 23 days of age in calves of the 1st cohort while it took place at around two weeks of age (10\u201316 days) in calves of the 2nd and 3rd cohorts, this latter pattern being in agreement with previous data obtained with C. parvum in dairy calves (Sant\u00edn et al., 2004). Similarly, the highest prevalence of cryptosporidiosis varied from one cohort to another. In the first cohort, the maximum prevalence was seen in animals aged 24\u201330 days, while these peaks were reached early in calves from the second and third cohorts (between 17\u201323 and 10\u201316 days of age, respectively). Both the earlier peaks of prevalence and excretion in cohorts 2 and 3 suggest a more intense contamination of the premises, leading to a very early exposure of the calves (Silverl\u00e5s et al., 2010, Silverl\u00e5s et al., 2013). As Cryptosporidium oocysts are widely dispersed and can survive for months in the environment (Chalmers and Giles, 2010), the build-up of oocysts in a given environment, if not modified by adapted disinfectants or cleaning procedures, may represent a high risk to the newborn animals.",

(2008), the first detection of C. bovis and C. ryanae took place later, at 4 and 8 weeks of life respectively, whereas other studies demonstrated earlier excretion of these species (at 2\u20134 weeks of life) (Feng et al., 2007, Silverl\u00e5s et al., 2010). In our study, we did observe an effect due to age and year of sampling on the distribution of Cryptosporidium species in pre-weaned beef calves. Calves from the first cohort excreted mainly the species C. bovis between 10 and 30 days of age, whereas none of the calves from the third cohort excreted this species. Calves from the second cohort excreted C. parvum and C. bovis with similar age patterns (7\u201327 and 11\u201330 days of age respectively) and levels of excretion (500 to 2 \u00d7 106\n opg), whereas calves from the third cohort excreted mainly the species C. parvum from 4 to 26 days of age. The species C. ryanae was distinctly identified in older calves (from 18 to 30 days old) from each cohort and at lower levels of excretion (range: 1 \u00d7 103 to 2.2 \u00d7 105\n opg). In view of these observations, it is possible that neonatal calves are more susceptible to infection with C. parvum and C. bovis than to infection with C. ryanae or, the higher infection dose in calves could come with a shorter prepatent period because shedding rates could pass the detection level earlier than at a lower dose (Silverl\u00e5s et al., 2013), as has been described in lambs (Blewett et al., 1993, Ortega-Mora and Wright, 1994). These observations also confirm that the age-related occurrence of Cryptosporidium species in calves is not totally well defined and varies according to the survey location, the load of oocysts in the environment and, notably, calf management system (Feng et al., 2007, Geurden et al., 2007, Sant\u00edn et al., 2008, Silverl\u00e5s et al., 2010, Budu-Amoako et al., 2012). The animals involved in our study were all housed together with the calves born earlier in the calving season. This may explain why they were infected with species usually found in older calves, in contrast with the dairy farms, where neonates are usually raised separately from older animals. However, this hypothesis deserves further investigation because the observations of Silverl\u00e5s and Blanco-Penedo (2012) showed that calves staying with the dam 3 days after birth excreted the same species of Cryptosporidium than those immediately removed. Here, we also observed differences in distribution of Cryptosporidium species in the same cattle herd over time, while animal management parameters remained comparable.",

The three Cryptosporidium species were found in diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic samples, although the species found in diarrhoeic samples was mainly C. parvum. The species C. parvum is frequently recorded as the dominant species in diarrhoeic calves, while C. ryanae seems to occur in subclinical situations (Kv\u00e1\u010d et al., 2006, Fayer et al., 2008, Sant\u00edn et al., 2008). The role of C. bovis with regard to diarrhoea is more conflicting as this species has been described in both diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic samples from dairy calves (Silverl\u00e5s et al., 2010). Other enteric viral or bacterial pathogens (E. coli, Rotavirus, Coronavirus) can be observed in calves during the first 3 weeks of life and can contribute to the severity of cryptosporidiosis (de Graaf et al., 1999). Here, among the 40 diarrhoeic samples identified in calves (<3 weeks of age) from the third cohort, 21 were found to be infected with C. parvum only. This observation confirms the clear implication of C. parvum in the occurrence of clinical signs in beef calves less than 3 weeks of age.",

            "text": "Lastly, the risk to human health posed by Cryptosporidium infection in beef calves was investigated. The detection of the zoonotic species C. parvum in beef calves between 4 and 26 days old confirmed the potential role of young beef calves in human cryptosporidiosis suggested by some authors (Atwill et al., 2003). Following analysis of a fragment of the gp60 gene to determine C. parvum subtypes, we obtained two subtypes belonging to the IIa family. In this study, subtypes IIaA15G2R1 and IIaA18G1R1 were identified. These subtypes were already described in calves (Alves et al., 2006, Plutzer and Karanis, 2007, Soba and Logar, 2008, Wielinga et al., 2008, Coklin et al., 2009, Follet et al., 2011). Subtype IIaA15G2R1 has been widely reported in calves and humans in several countries such as Portugal, Slovenia, the Netherlands and France (Alves et al., 2006, Soba and Logar, 2008, Wielinga et al., 2008, Follet et al., 2011, Rieux et al., 2013b). Subtype IIaA18G1R1 was described for the first time in one diarrhoeic pre-weaned calf in Hungary in 2007 by Plutzer and Karanis and was also found recently in young diarrhoeic calves in Sweden (Silverl\u00e5s et al., 2013). During our study this subtype was found in diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic samples as well. In a given farm, the number of subtypes found can be restricted to only one when no animal movement occurs (Brook et al., 2009, Silverl\u00e5s et al., 2013). In our study, little trading within the cattle herd occurred, but other livestock flocks (dairy goats, meat sheep) were present at the same location and transportation of faecal material through animal workers cannot be ruled out. Another explanation could be that the other subtype, IIaA18G2R1, were carried by exchange of faecal material by a new animal entering the herd, such as a bull or by another individual working on the farm. Due to unreadable gp60 sequences of some isolates identified as C. parvum, it is also possible that both subtypes had been circulating in calves since the previous year, but that the dominant subtype was subtype IIaA18G2R1. These results suggest that the dominant subtype of C. parvum can vary in the same beef cattle herd from year to year. Moreover, this observation confirms previous studies and strongly suggests a possible role for beef calves as a reservoir for human zoonotic isolates of C. parvum in western France.",
