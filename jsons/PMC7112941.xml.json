The FNA was triggered by an earthquake off the coast of Japan that registered 9.0 on the Moment magnitude scale. The earthquake and the ensuing tsunami resulted in massive economic losses and environmental damage.1\nOver 100,000 residents who lived within 20 km of the nuclear power plant were forced to evacuate one day after the accident. The Japanese Science Ministry reported that long-lived radioactive cesium had contaminated over 30,000 km2 of Japanese land (World Nuclear Association, 2014). Additionally, a large amount of contaminated water accumulated on the site, and managing the contaminated water is a difficult and risky endeavour.",

To provide a flavour of the public's reaction to this large-scale nuclear accident, Fig. 1\npresents the frequency of Google searches involving the keywords \u201cNuclear Power Plant\u201d across six countries.4\nIn each country, search frequencies soared to their peak levels in the days immediately after the FNA, but then declined sharply over the following one to two months. The trend of Google searches appears very similar across the six countries. Although the search frequency trend suggests intensive but short-lived public interest, the real effects of the FNA on the public acceptance of nuclear power are still unclear. On one hand, if people overreacted only temporarily as predicted by prospect theory, then the FNA will not have a persistent effect on risk perception. On the other hand, it is possible that risk assessment is permanently heightened as a result of the increased awareness of nuclear safety concerns in the post\u2013FNA era.",

Using data from various sources, a growing body of literature has sought to track the impact of environmental disamenities on property values using revealed preference models.5\nAn implicit assumption of early studies is that the risk associated with environmental disamenities is constant over time. However, this assumption is not sensible in our case, because the FNA led to the public updating their assessment of the risks of nuclear energy, which consequently affected their marginal willingness to pay for property located near nuclear plants. China was selected for our study on the price effects of changes in perceptions of nuclear safety-related risk because it has a fast-growing number of nuclear power plants. However, it was not itself directly impacted by the FNA, as it experienced neither earthquake-related destruction, nor radiation contamination.",

However, we did not find significant negative effects further than that distance. This geographic cutoff is similar to the extended distance of contamination in Japan. Second, the effects are transitory, as the impact of FNA on land prices near nuclear plants decreased in the months following the disaster and became statistically insignificant. Third, the effects are heterogeneous across nearby plants. That is, the estimated short-run effects are stronger for land parcels near operational plants and those under construction. Additionally, older plants and those with a larger capacity impacted nearby land prices more profoundly, demonstrating the rational variance of price with the level of perceived risk.",

Both studies find that the housing prices near nuclear power plants have decreased after FNA. However, due to the social media censorship in China, the spreading of information, which can consequently influence the updated risk perception, may result in different impacts on real estate markets in China than in other countries. Indeed, we find that compared to the evidence from Switzerland and Germany, the reaction of land markets in China is much stronger in terms of magnitude and affected distance. However, it only lasts for one month, which is substantially shorter than the estimates found in those two countries. We believe that the empirical findings of this paper will highlight important economic implications of the development of the nuclear industry and energy policy in China.",

Many studies in this area tend to look at the value of housing in proximity to hazardous sites over a long term period, assuming that people get complete information. Muller and Mendelsohn (2009) consider the role of regulation policy and calculate the welfare gain of switching pollutant trading program for 3130 electric generating units in the US. While such studies tend to disregard the FNA-like shocks that dramatically influence risk perception, the current paper aims specifically to evaluate the effects of such shocks on public risk assessment and on price. Our study thus adds to the discussion on how an exogenous shock that impacts the perceived risk arising from proximity to hazardous sites influences the marginal value of property in the area. Since the FNA did not have a direct impact on China's environment, we believe that the findings we present represents the pure price effect of the updated perceived risk associated with hazard facilities.",

As outlined previously, as well as having direct economic consequences (Barone and Mocetti, 2014), natural disasters also influence people's risk perception. Theories of experimental psychology predict that people and markets will over-respond to unpredictable events by giving more recent information more weight (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979). These theories are supported by numerous empirical studies that track stock prices following such unpredicted events (Bondt and Thaler, 1985, Brooks et al., 2003, Ederington and Lee, 1993). Nevertheless, it is worth noting that such an overreaction to changed risk perception is not universal, and that patterns of risk perception make it such that this effect does not hold in all markets (Viscusi, 1990). In the case of the real estate market, it is still unclear if it can respond as fast as the stock markets. Many recent empirical studies have investigated the reaction of property prices to different unexpected events, and found mixed results.7\nOur paper therefore contributes to the literature by showing how a disaster can change risk perceptions internationally.",

The investment in a nuclear power plant can have significant economic effects on local communities and empirical studies have shown that the establishment of a nuclear energy facility generally stimulates per capita income and employment (Ando, 2015). However, unlike other large-scale power generation projects, the major issue associated with nuclear power is the unpredictability of the health and environmental risks posed to neighbouring communities. The public concern over nuclear hazards has historically been provoked by a number of significant nuclear plant accidents. Of these, only two have measured up to level 7 (the highest level) on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES).

The first explosion of the No.1 reactor occurred on March 11, 2011 and was followed immediately by the evacuation of people living within a 20 km radius of the power plant. The subsequent explosions on March 15 of the No. 2 and No. 4 reactors raised the overall level of concern and the evacuation zone was extended up to a 30 km radius. The melting of the reactor on the same date raised concerns over the spread of radiation to a wider area through wind and rain. The graphs in Appendix A illustrate the ground level dose rate and the rate of deposit of radioactive substances (mainly cesium-134 and cesium-137) that were being leaked by the reactor one month after the accident. The graphs show that the most affected areas were in the northwest parts of the plant. While the radiation dose for people living within 40 km of Fukushima is greater than 2\u03bcSv per hour (equivalent to about 7884 millirems per year), the average exposure to natural radiation among people in non-contaminated zones is only 300 millirems per year (at sea level). Even the US federal limit for occupational radiation exposure for individuals involved in work in nuclear zones (5000 millirems per year) is far surpassed in the area surrounding the plant. What's more, the two main radionuclides, cesium-137 and cesium-134, have 30-year half-life and 2-year half-life respectively, which means that the contamination of the affected areas will persist for an extendedperiod (World Nuclear Association, 2014).",

While the first commercial nuclear plant began operation at Daya Bay only in February 1994, the nuclear industry subsequently moved into a rapid phase of development. Soaring demands for energy coupled with serious concerns over pollution led to the establishment of huge incentives to build new nuclear power plants. This policy, together with the substantially lower costs of constructing a nuclear power plant in China relative to other countries, means that China's nuclear generating capacity is the fastest growing in the world (Davis, 2012). The construction of eight additional nuclear power plants was announced in the Tenth Economic Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005), and the numbers have risen consistently in the years since.

However, in 2004, the central government decided to use the Westinghouse AP1000, a Generation-III technology, rather than the indigenous technology pushed by the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), to be the main nuclear reactor technology in the near future. The latest technology acquisition is therefore mainly from the US via Westinghouse (owned by Toshiba) and French. The safety level of a nuclear power plant is associated with many aspects including the generation of the reactor technology, training of nuclear power workforce, and the safety culture at the operation level. It is expected that along with the newly planned AP1000 reactor and the investment in nuclear power workforce training, the risk of nuclear accident will be substantially reduced in the future. In fact, as China has endeavoured to achieve world's best standards in nuclear safety, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) concludes high confidence on China's nuclear safety regulation system (World Nuclear Association, 2014).8\n",

They also pressed the authorities to release more information about the operation, construction and future development of China's nuclear power (Thomson, 2011). In response to the FNA and the subsequent rising concern of the general public over the safety of nuclear power, the State Council announced its decision to temporarily suspend the approval of new nuclear power plants. The authorities also decided to conduct a comprehensive safety check of all nuclear power plants, which were all found to be safe after the inspection (He et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2014). The national policy toward nuclear energy changed from \u201cpositive development\u201d in 2004 to \u201csteady development with safety\u201d between 2011 and 2012. Nevertheless, the suspension of the approval of new nuclear power plants was short-lived and new construction projects received official approval from October 2012.",

In particular, the city governments are the only legitimate sellers in the primary urban land markets. After some reforms in the early 2000s, the procedure of urban land market transactions has been standardized. At the beginning of each year, a local land planning committee decides on leasehold details, including the total amount of leaseholds, land use regulations, the sequences of sales, and reserve price of each individual parcel. Subsequently, the land parcels are sold by the land bureau via a selected transaction method, such as negotiated sales, English auctions, two-stage auctions, and sealed bids (Cai et al., 2013, Qin et al., 2016).9\n",

In practice, auctions with detailed land characteristics are announced about 20 days in advance, a cash deposit is required to be made for each auction participant. It is noteworthy that different from the conventional English auction where potential bidders enter simultaneously, the two-stage auction has a first stage of approximately 10 days during which the auction details are listed, bidders are required to express interest in entering the auction with their minimum prices publicized. If there are at least two bidders willing to offer prices above the reserve price set by the government, then the transaction turns into an English auction in the second stage (Cai et al., 2013).",

As one nuclear power plant usually contains multiple reactors constructed at different times, newer reactors had to be manually matched with their plants by cross-referencing their project names. By referencing the construction dates and the dates of operation, we were able to infer the operating status of each nuclear power reactor. Using the time of the FNA (2011) as our frame of reference, we categorized the plants into three major groups: operational, under construction, and in planning. If a nuclear plant had at least one operating reactor, it was categorized as being operational.

After grouping the reactors into different plants by their project names, Fig. 2\npresents the location of all 45 nuclear plants, each of which either were already hosting or were going to host one or more reactors.

Furthermore, two recent studies: Bauer et al., 2013, Boes et al., 2015, which investigate the impacts of FNA on the real estate markets in German and Switzerland, find that the impacts are restricted to areas within 5 km and 20 km radius, respectively. Therefore, choosing a zone 100\u2013140 km away from nuclear power plant sites is rather conservative.",

That is, the public's perception of the risk of nuclear accidents and the expected disutility of disaster exposure decreases with distance from the plants. Therefore, if any, the treatment effects of FNA on land prices are expected to decline with distance. To examine this, we use the regression method to search for effects at different distance bands from the nuclear plants. Specifically, we divide the 100 km buffer zones around the nuclear power plant sites into five rings, and estimate the effects of FNA on land prices using each individual band as a treatment group until the estimated effects of FNA on land prices taper off. Hence the cut-off distance of the significant effects and insignificant effects implies the maximum geographic extension of the impact of FNA.",

Using proximity to nuclear plant sites as a criteria for defining treatment and control groups fits well into the special context of this paper because the impacts of FNA on risk perception tend to differ spatially.15\nMoreover, the land market policies during the investigation window largely focused at the national level, and are unlikely to be regional-specific or differ with the distance to nearest nuclear plants. One potential concern on the validity of our identification strategy is about the general economic impacts of nuclear plants, which may subsequently affect the land prices. For example, Ando (2015) shows heterogeneous effects of nuclear power plant establishment on the local economic growth. However, we consider that the potential growth effect of nuclear plants will not influence our causal inferences for three reasons: First, in our regressions, we include the 5 km night light around each land parcel and city-distance band fixed effects to partially capture the local economic activity. Second, the economic growth effect of nuclear plants tends to exist in the long run,16\nhowever, our study only focuses on a much shorter time period (9 months) after FNA. Third, and more importantly, as the key assumption for the DID estimations in this study is that there is no significant difference between the changes of land prices for treatment group and control group before FNA, in Section 5, we will show that this common trend assumption indeed holds by estimating Eq.

Plants constructed in earlier years tend to use older production techniques, making maintenance more difficult and increasing the chances of leaks. For the public, the construction year of a plant is more straightforward than the other reactor details as a signal of the technology and safety level. Therefore, individual risk perceptions may decrease with construction year. Moreover, electricity-generating capacity can also affect individual risk perceptions, as it is sensible to assume that larger plants may cause more damage in case of a nuclear accident.

Nevertheless, in Column 2, we find heterogeneous long-term effects: the coefficient of I\nSep. to Dec. 2011\n \u00d7 \nI\ntreatment\n \u00d7 \ny_gap is 0.013 and I\nSep. to Dec. 2011\n \u00d7 \nI\ntreatment\n \u00d7 \ny_gap\n \u00d7 \ncapacity is \u22120.022, both of which are marginally significant at the 10% level. This result suggests that, in the long run, the impact of FNA on land market tends to decrease with older plants, and this impact is larger for big plants. Results in Column 4 report similar findings except that the interaction term I\nSep. to Dec. 2011\n \u00d7 \nI\ntreatment\n \u00d7 \ncapacity is not statistically significant.

Column 2 places the treatment group boundary at 60 km, while keeping the control group boundary the same as Column 1. After extending the treatment boundary for 20 km, neither the short-term nor long-term impacts of FNA are found to be significant. This suggests that including area that are less affected into the treatment groups will lead to an imprecise estimation of the real treatment effects. Columns 3 and 4 replicate the above regressions but narrow the control group boundaries further to 100\u2013120 km. The estimated treatment effects of FNA are reported to be slightly larger than those in Columns 1 and 2. In summary, evidence from these various combinations of treatment and control groups implies that: a) the conclusion of short-term effects of FNA on land prices is robust to the choice of control groups, and b) our inferred 40 km treatment boundary is a credible choice for assessing the effect of FNA on risk perception.",

In this section, we conduct a placebo test to assure that the short-lived impacts we have found are only related to the FNA and the nuclear power plants. To do this, we randomly select 45 coal-fired plants in China, we geocode these selected coal-fired power plants and match them with the nearby land parcels using the same method that we have applied in the previous analysis. Fig. 6\nshows the spatial locations of the selected thermal plants and the matched land parcels. It can be observed that the chosen coal-fired power plants mainly locate in the north and middle China, which is due to the uneven natural resources (inland water and coal) distribution. However, the distinct difference of geographic locations of coal-fired and nuclear power plants in southern and northern China enables us to avoid mixing the impacts of nuclear power plants on land prices after FNA in this placebo test.",

As it is shown that all the estimated effects in different treated months are statistically insignificant, the short-term effects in April 2011 is even positive, which are substantially different from the estimated effects near the nuclear power plants. In Columns 3 and 4, we examine whether there are any trends of the estimated effects in different time spans. In contrast to our previous results, the estimated coefficients appear to decrease over time, which is opposite to what we have found in Table 4.

As the land transactions we used in the regressions are limited to the primary land market, where the local governments are the sellers and they have market power in their own land markets. Therefore, to ascertain that the short-term negative price effects of FNA on neighbourhood land markets we estimated are driven by the increased risk perception of the buyers, rather than the temporary changes of other factors such as strategic sales of the governments after FNA. We restrict our regression sample to land transactions that are sold via three major auction types in Chinese land market: two-stage auction, English auction and sealed bid, which account for about 56% of our total observations.",

As we described in the background section, the land development planning and sequence of land sales are determined by a local land planning committee each year, so it is less likely that the local government can change their publicized land selling schedule temporarily. Second, different from the mechanism of negotiated sales, in which the seller (local government) and buyer are negotiating a price, and the land sale can be closed if the negotiated price is higher than the reserve price set by the government. The public auction sales, however, are much more competitive. If the nuclear risk perception of bidders has increased after the FNA, then it should be reflected in the final transaction prices. Table 10\nshows the regression results using this sub-sample. The estimated short-term effects are similar to our findings in column 2 of Table 5 in terms of magnitude and significance level. Therefore, we argue that the price effects of FNA are mostly driven by the public's increased risk perception.",

Many countries have acted quickly to enhance the regulation of nuclear energy after the disaster. Estimating and understanding the impacts of FNA on the public's perception of the risk of nuclear energy outside Japan are particularly important. If individuals overreact to the disaster, then the immediate policy response of governments will be driven by these overreactions and may not be efficient in the long run. Using a comprehensive dataset of land transactions in China before and after FNA, this paper examines the effects of FNA on land prices near nuclear power plants in China, so as to assess the impact of changes in the public acceptance of nuclear energy after FNA.",

In particular, land prices drop by an average of about 18% one month after FNA. This 40 km buffer is similar to the extent of radiation leakage in Fukushima in Japan, indicating that even though the disaster did not affect China directly, its influences on risk perceptions can also be widespread and considerable. Second, we find the impacts are heterogeneous in various aspects. We find that the impacts were mainly concentrated in April 2011, the first month after FNA, which is a clear evidence of overreaction in the market. In addition, the effects of FNA varied significantly by plant running status. In the short run, land prices dropped significantly near operating and constructing plants, while there are still long-lived effects for the plants being constructed.
