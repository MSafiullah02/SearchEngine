The HCV NS5B gene encodes a polymerase, which is responsible for virus replication and is a potential target for the development of antiviral agents. Many studies for classification of HCV use a particular segment of the NS5B gene, in addition to other specific regions, and phylogenetic analysis. Actually, some nucleoside/nucleotide analogues and nonnucleoside inhibitors target NS5B protein. This review focuses on HCV variability, phylogenetic analysis and the role of NS5B in the virus-host interactions.",

The catalytic domain, formed by N-terminal 530 aa, exhibits the classical \"fingers\", \"palm\" and \"thumb\" subdomains typically seen in all RNA dependent RNA polymerases. The active site of NS5B is fully encircled by the fingers and thumb domains, which closely interact. All regular structures, studied until now, reveal a closed conformation, encircled on one side by the fingertips and on the other side by the linker and the so-called b-hairpin. Therefore, the active site is fully enclosed and the nucleotide molecules can bind easily with no further rearrangement of the domains [14, 15] . As observed in in vitro studies, NS5B is able to conduct a template-directed RNA synthesis on its own, requiring only divalent metals (magnesium or manganese) as cofactors. NS5B can also catalyze both de novo synthesis from a single-stranded template and primer extension from the subsequent RNA duplex or from a pre-annealed template/primer duplex [16] .",

The architecture of the membrane alterations induced by HCV reveals unexpected similarities between HCV and the unrelated picorna-and coronaviruses. Therefore, HCV induces, early during an infection, double membrane vesicles (DMVs), which emerge as protrusions of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Later on, HCV triggers multi-membrane vesicles (MMVs) that are probably the result of a cellular stress reaction [18] . Consequently, morphology of the MW depends not only on RNA replication, but also on activity of the nonstructural proteins NS3-NS5B, in concert with cellular factors [15] . Indeed, host factors such as lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III alpha (PI4KIII\u03b1) are essential for RNA replication and interact with NS5B and NS5A proteins. Silencing of PI4KIII\u03b1 reduces vesicles formation, suggesting that this enzyme is critically involved in web morphology and consequently in viral replication [19, 20] .",

Moreover, 83 cellular factors such as translation factors, ribosomal proteins, and metabolic enzymes have been found to be associated with HCV genomic RNA.

[10] , reported the significant finding of HCV homologous non-primate virus. Phylogenetic analysis of conserved regions in NS3 and NS5B genes of rodent virus demonstrated homologous sequences with human viruses. The homology allows to hypothesize a zoonotic source of infection and suggests development of new animal models useful to investigate HCV pathogenesis and treatment. In particular, comparative genetic analysis and functional characterization studies might reveal host specificity determinants and different tissue tropism [10] . Extrahepatic replication of HCV in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) has significant implications for disease progression and treatment outcome. However, few data are available concerning HCV variability in extrahepatic sites. Blackard et al. [43] , by phylogenetic analysis of NS5B and E1/HVR1 sequences, evaluated quasispecies extrahepatic diversity by assessing NS5B variability in serum and PBMC samples from chronic HCV patients. Moreover, they identified the possible compartmentalization in PBMCs of HCV variants. Adaptive evolution of non-structural genomic regions such as NS5B could contribute to HCV persistence [43] .",

The informative sites distinguishing clade 1 from clade 2 are distributed throughout the genome, but are mainly located in the E1, E2, NS2, NS5A, and NS5B coding regions. In particular, one site within the 5\u2032 UTR and several sites within the NS5B genotyping fragments differ between clades 1 and 2, this information could be helpful to known if clades differ for therapy resistance. Furthermore, several variants are located at codons associated with resistance to protease inhibitors (NS3 Q41) or polymerase inhibitors (NS5B S368) [44] .",
