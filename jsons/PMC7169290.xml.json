Based on history, clinical signs, serum antibody titers, and failure to demonstrate other etiologies, this cat's uveitis initially was attributed to toxoplasmosis. The presence of positive serum antibody titers to T. gondii and correlation between titer and uveitis are controversial in cats without systemic signs of infection. However, seroprevalence of T. gondii is higher in cats with anterior uveitis than in those without anterior uveitis.\n28\n In this case, detection of decreasing serum T. gondii IgM antibody titer after administration of clindamycin suggested the presence of active toxoplasmosis at the initial presentation. Although this patient had an IgM/IgG C\u2010value of < 1, which is inconsistent with ocular toxoplasmosis, this was calculated using samples collected following administration of prednisolone. Therefore, this test result cannot be accurately interpreted because glucocorticoid administration can significantly decrease intraocular T. gondii\u2010specific antibody production.\n21\n Also, the effect on C\u2010value of surgical manipulation of the globe, in this case prior to collection of aqueous humor, is unknown. Failure to amplify T.\u2010gondii DNA from the subretinal fluid of the patient could be interpreted to mean that T. gondii was not involved with the ocular disease.\n29\n However, PCR results using aqueous humor are commonly negative in cats with experimentally induced T.\u2010gondii infection and validation of this assay for subretinal fluid has not been performed. In addition, it is possible that this cat was infected with both T. gondii and fungus and that, while clindamycin administration led to the negative T.\u2010gondii PCR result, ocular inflammation persisted because of the fungal infection. Unfortunately, ocular tissue was not later available for determination of the presence of T.\u2010gondii DNA.",

Although H.\u2010capsulatum antibody production was not observed in this case, false\u2010negative serologic tests have been reported in feline histoplasmosis.\n24\n An antigen test also was negative. The H.\u2010capsulatum antigen detection test is most sensitive in human patients with disseminated or acute pulmonary histoplasmosis\n30\n and false negatives are common in experimental subjects with a low fungal burden.\n31\n Although this case did not appear to have disseminated fungal disease or a large fungal load, the diagnosis of ocular histoplasmosis could not be excluded on the basis of this negative result. The negative PCR result for H.\u2010capsulatum DNA on the fixed enucleated eye of this cat was an interesting finding. As PCR methods for identifying H.\u2010capsulatum DNA are not currently validated or accepted as accurate in human or veterinary patients, clinical interpretation of this result was difficult.\n31\n Molecular diagnostic methods such as PCR are thought to be the most sensitive tests for identification of many infectious organisms. However, in mice affected with histoplasmosis, PCR evaluation for H. capsulatum was not significantly more sensitive than silver stains for identification of the organism.\n32\n Also, fixation of the tissue may have caused DNA denaturation and cross\u2010linking, resulting in the absence or significant reduction of extracted DNA. The possibility that an unknown fungal organism morphologically similar to H. capsulatum caused ocular disease in this patient also exists. Diagnosis by isolation of the organism from cultures provides the strongest evidence for infection with H. capsulatum in humans and animals.\n31\n Unfortunately, fungal culture was not performed in this case because fixation of tissue made culture impossible following histopathologic identification of fungal organisms.",

Immunosuppressive factors are thought to have a minor role in predisposing cats to H.\u2010capsulatum infection, but concurrent infection with FeLV, FIV, or FIP has been reported.\n25\n, \n35\n In immunocompromised humans, opportunistic infections with H. capsulatum and T. gondii can occur in the heart, lungs, and ocular tissues.\n42\n, \n43\n, \n44\n To the authors\u2019 knowledge, no reports exist of concurrent seropositivity to, or infection with both H. capsulatum and T. gondii in any species.",
