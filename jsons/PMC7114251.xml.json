            "text": "Respiratory viral infections (RVIs) are the most frequent reason for medical consultations in the world (Anzueto and Niederman, 2003). They can be associated with a wide range of clinical manifestations from self-limited infections of the upper respiratory tract to more devastating conditions affecting the lower respiratory tract, such as pneumonia. In addition, RVIs have a considerable impact on quality of life and productivity of the society. For example, in the United States alone, these infections are responsible for 20 million absences from work and 22 million absences from school every year (Brooks et al., 2004). The annual burden of epidemic influenza alone averages millions of physicians visits, 150,000 hospitalizations, and 36,000 deaths (CDC, 2005). In the United States, the costs of non-influenza-related RVIs may reach 40 billion dollars annually (Fenderick et al., 2003). Each year, consumers spend 2\u20133 billion dollars on a myriad of products marketed to treat cold symptoms, such as antihistamine, analgesic, antitussive and anti-inflammatory agents (Temte, 2000).",

Recently identified respiratory viruses such as human metapneumovirus (Van den Hoogen et al., 2001, Boivin et al., 2002a); human parechovirus-3 (Ito et al., 2004, Boivin et al., 2005), and new human coronaviruses (HCoVs), such as the one associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Ksiazek et al., 2003) as well as HCoV-NL (Fouchier et al., 2004) and HCoV-HKU1 (Woo et al., 2005a, Woo et al., 2005b) are important additions to this list. Currently, there are approximately 200 known viruses that typically produce respiratory syndromes. They are grouped into five viral families including one family of DNA viruses (Adenoviridae) and four families of RNA viruses (Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Picornaviridae and Coronaviridae) (Table 1\n). The purpose of this paper is to review the major respiratory viruses that cause diseases in humans, with an emphasis on current therapeutic options.",

These agents inhibit an early step in the influenza A virus replication cycle by interfering with the function of the viral M2 protein (Fig. 1\n). The latter acts as an ion channel through which the hydrogen ions pass into the interstices of the viral particle, resulting in the dissociation of the matrix protein (M1) from the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. The RNP can then enter the cell nucleus and initiate replication (Martin and Helenius, 1991). Both amantadine and rimantadine are effective at low doses against various subtypes of influenza A viruses whereas they have no activity against influenza B viruses. In cell culture experiments, the concentration of amantadine that inhibits influenza A virus plaque formation by 50% (IC50) varies from 0.1 to 0.4 \u03bcg/ml (Hayden and Palese, 2002).",

Molecular characterization of adamantane-resistant influenza A variants has revealed that a single substitution at one of five codons (26, 27, 30, 31, and 34) in the transmembrane region of the M2 protein may confer drug resistance (Klimov et al., 1995, Masuda et al., 2000, Boivin et al., 2002b, Saito et al., 2003). A recent report showed that H3N2-infected individuals shed more amantadine-resistant variants than their H1N1-infected counterparts (Saito et al., 2003). Of note, the current avian influenza H5N1 virus (Z strain), which emerged in Southeast Asia, is resistant to amantadine (Li et al., 2004). This concern is further enhanced by the fact that adamantane-resistant mutant viruses were found to maintain good replicative capacities in vitro and were at least as virulent as wild-type (sensitive) viruses in animal models (Sweet et al., 1991, Abed et al., 2005). Furthermore, adamantane-resistant influenza A viruses are transmissible in humans (Hayden et al., 1989).",

NAIs inhibit the cleavage of the terminal sialic acid residues attached to viral glycoproteins and cellular glycolipids (Fig. 1), a process necessary for release of influenza virions from host cells and for spread of the virus throughout respiratory mucus (Palese and Compans, 1976). Zanamivir and oseltamir have excellent in vitro activity against all nine NA subtypes of influenza A and against the NA of influenza B viruses (Mendel and Roberts, 1998). Notably, these drugs are effective against avian viruses of the H5N1 subtype, although higher doses and prolonged treatment with oseltamivir were required to achieve inhibition of such viruses in mice (Yen et al., 2005). The zanamivir IC50 values for clinical isolates vary widely using a plaque reduction assay (PRA) in Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (2\u201316,000 nM), but fall in a much narrower range (0.64\u20137.9 nM) by directly testing the inhibition of NA activity using an enzymatic assay (Whetherall et al., 2003). Zanamivir exhibits better in vitro antiviral activity against influenza B viruses, whereas oseltamivir has lower IC50 values against influenza A isolates (Boivin and Goyette, 2002, Whetherall et al., 2003).",

Ten to 20% of the inhaled dose is bioavailable; however, the concentration of the drug in the respiratory tract is estimated to be >1000 times that of the IC50 value of influenza A and B viruses (Peng et al., 2000). Absorbed drug is excreted in the urine without metabolic changes (Cass et al., 1999b). Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is available for oral administration (capsules or liquid suspension) as an ethyl ester prodrug which is converted to its active form (oseltamivir carboxylate) after ester hydrolysis in the gut (Kim et al., 1997). About 75% of the dose is widely distributed in the body, allowing the drug to be active outside the respiratory tract (Moscona, 2005). Oseltamivir carboxylate is excreted mainly through the kidneys; therefore, dosing must be reduced in patients with advanced renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) (Moscona, 2005).",

Zanamivir at a dose of 10 mg twice daily for 5 days started within 48 h of onset of symptoms reduced the duration of symptoms of naturally occurring influenza infections by 1\u20132.5 days in adults (Monto et al., 1999b, Hayden et al., 1997, The MIST Study Group, 1998, Makela et al., 2000, Boivin et al., 2000). In children 5\u201312 years old, zanamivir reduced duration of symptoms by 1.25 days (Hedrick et al., 2000). A meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials has also demonstrated that zanamivir conferred reduction in duration of symptoms by 2.5 days with a 43% reduction in complications in high-risk patients with confirmed influenza infection (Lalezari et al., 2001). Similarly, oseltamivir is effective in the treatment of naturally occurring influenza infections in adults (Nicholson et al., 2000, Treanor et al., 2000, Aoki et al., 2003). In patients treated with either 75 mg (recommended dose) or 150 mg of oseltamivir b.i.d. for 5 days, the median time to alleviation of symptoms was reduced by 1.2 and 1.45 days, respectively (Nicholson et al., 2000). In adults and adolescents with a proven influenza illness, oseltamivir treatment reduced the incidence of influenza-related lower respiratory tract complications and antibiotic use by 55% and 26.7%, respectively (Kaiser et al., 2003). In children (1\u201312 years old), oseltamivir treatment reduced the median duration of illness by 1.5 days and afforded reductions in cough, coryza and fever (Whitley et al., 2001). The incidence of antibiotic prescriptions was also significantly reduced in the oseltamivir group (31%) compared to the placebo group (41%). For maximal benefits, antiviral treatment must start as early as possible and within 48 h of the onset of symptoms. Indeed, for every 6 h reduction of oseltamivir treatment initiation time compared to symptom onset, median illness duration could be shortened by \u223c10 h (Aoki et al., 2003). In United States of America, zanamivir is approved for treatment of individuals \u22657 years (10 mg twice daily for 5 days) whereas oseltamivir is licensed for treatment of persons >1 year (30\u201375 mg twice daily for 5 days) (Moscona, 2005).",

            "text": "In vitro studies have shown that numerous (12\u201320) viral passages in presence of the drug are required to select resistant variants. Resistance to NAIs can result from mutations in the active site of the NA enzyme, associated or not with aa changes in or near the receptor binding site of the HA protein. The latter changes are thought to reduce viral dependency on NA activity. However, the clinical consequences of HA mutations on development of NAI resistance have not been demonstrated, in contrast to NA mutations (Abed et al., 2002, Gubareva et al., 2001). NA mutations associated with NAI resistance are subtype-specific and drug-specific and involve both catalytic and framework residues (Table 4\n). Mutations at codon 292 (Arg292Lys) and 119 (Glu119Val) predominate in H3N2 viruses, whereas a His274Tyr mutation (N2 numbering) is the most frequent in H1N1 viruses (Abed et al., 2004, Whitley et al., 2001, Wang et al., 2002, Weinstock et al., 2003). Of note, the last mutation has been reported in H5N1 viruses isolated in Asia (Le et al., 2005; de Jong et al., 2005). Unlike amantadine-resistant variants, NAI-resistant influenza viruses were infrequent in clinical trials with estimated rates of resistance varying from 0.4% to 1% in the adult population and from 4% to 8% in children (Roberts, 2001). However, higher rates (18%) of oseltamivir resistance were reported in a recent treatment study of Japanese children (Kiso et al., 2004). Most, but probably not all, NAI-resistant variants seem to be compromised with regard to infectivity and transmissibility in mice (Ives et al., 2002) and ferrets (Herlocher et al., 2002). So far, resistance to zanamivir has been extremely infrequent, with one case reported from an immunocompromised child infected with influenza B (Gubareva et al., 1998). Whether this lower rate of resistance is due to intrinsic drug properties or lower use of this compound compared to oseltamivir should be clarified.",

Zanamivir derivative compounds containing different side-chains could also be considered as possible anti-influenza agents (De Clerq, 2002). The efficacy of the new NAIs against influenza A and B mutants is summarized in Table 4. Finally, ribavirin (discussed below) has in vitro activity against influenza viruses (Couch, 2000).

This drug has a broad spectrum of activity against DNA and RNA viruses (Balfour, 1999). Ribavirin inhibits viral replication by several mechanisms, including inhibition of viral polymerase, inhibition of 5\u2032 cap formation of mRNA, and inhibition of IMP dehydrogenase leading to a decrease of intracellular GTP concentrations (Balfour, 1999). Despite initial promising clinical studies, ribavirin was not found to confer clinical benefits in a large non-randomized cohort study of 223 previously healthy infants with respiratory failure due to HRSV infection (Moler et al., 1996). The clinical impact of ribavirin for treatment of HRSV lower respiratory tract infections in infants and children was also evaluated in a meta-analysis of 10 controlled trials (Vuvojic and Mills, 2001). The drug provided significant reduction in the duration of assisted ventilation whereas it had no significant impact on mortality rates, length of hospitalization and pulmonary functions. In 1996, the American Academy of Pediatrics revised its recommendation by replacing the statement \u2018ribavirin should be used\u2019 by \u2018ribavirin may be considered\u2019 in infants and young children at risk of severe HRSV disease. Nevertheless, ribavirin therapy remains recommended in high-risk patients for whom HRSV infection is associated with significant rates of mortality, such as bone marrow transplant recipients (Moscona, 2000, Englund et al., 1988). Ribavirin is highly toxic for bone marrow progenitors and is administered in an aerosolized form for treatment of respiratory tract infections.",

A conformational change of the F protein leading to the formation of a stable HR1/HR2 six-helix bundle is responsible for the fusion of viral and cellular membranes (Zhao et al., 2000). Therefore the HR1/HR2 region seems to be a suitable target for the development of anti-HRSV agents. Recombinant HR1 and HR2 proteins expressed in E. coli showed a strong inhibitory effect on HRSV fusion with IC50 values of 1.68 and 2.93 \u03bcM, respectively (Wang et al., 2003). Recently, several small molecules with potent inhibitory effects on HRSV fusion have been identified. The triphenyl compound VP-14637 (ViroPharma) and the benzimidazole analogue JNJ2408068 (Johnson and Johnson) are small molecules that bind into a hydrophobic cavity in the inner core of the F protein, interacting simultaneously with both HR1 and HR2 (Douglas et al., 2005). These agents efficiently inhibited HRSV infection in vitro with IC50 values of 1.4 and 2.1 nM, respectively (Douglas et al., 2005). In a cell fusion assay, the IC50 values of the same agents were 5.4 and 0.9 nM, respectively. The characterization of drug-resistant HRSV variants selected in vitro in presence of such inhibitors revealed amino acid changes in the HR2 (Asp486Asn, Glu487Asp, Phe488Tyr) and in the intervening domain between HR1 and HR2 (Lys399Ile and Thr400Ala) (Douglas et al., 2005). Further in vitro studies showed that substitutions at residues 486\u2013488, which are involved in direct contact with bound inhibitor, could be responsible for the resistance phenotype (Douglas et al., 2005).",

Interferons may also contribute with humoral antibodies and macrophages to the elimination of picornavirus infections (Balfour, 1999). Commercial preparations of interferon alpha are not orally bioavailable and need to be given by intramuscular or subcutaneous injections. Intranasal interferon \u03b1-2b was found to be active during clinical prophylactic studies of HRV infections, but has not demonstrated benefits in the treatment of established infection (McKinlay, 2001).

It acts by integrating into the cavity of the viral capsid to inhibit its uncoating, thus blocking attachment to host-cell receptors and inhibiting viral replication (Pevear et al., 1999). Pleconaril demonstrated a potent broad spectrum activity against 93 of the 101 HRV serotypes and 45 of 55 culturable enterovirus serotypes (McKinlay, 2001). Pleconaril exhibited a median IC50 value of 0.07 \u03bcg/ml when tested against 5 selected HRV serotypes and 46 clinical HRV isolates (Kaiser et al., 2000). Pharmacokinetic studies in adults and children have shown that plasma concentrations were above the drug concentration that inhibits >90% of HRVs in vitro after oral administration (Pevear et al., 1999). In clinical trials, pleconaril conferred reductions in symptom severity and duration in individuals with naturally occurring colds (Ison et al., 2002). A recent study has shown that the clinical benefit correlated with drug susceptibility of the baseline virus isolate (Pevear et al., 2005). Pleconaril-treated subjects infected with highly susceptible viruses (IC50 \u2264 0.38 \u03bcg/ml) experienced a median reduction in symptom duration of 1.9\u20133.9 days compared with that for the placebo-treated subjects. By contrast, subjects whose baseline virus isolate susceptibility was >0.38 \u03bcg/ml did not benefit from pleconaril treatment. During a 6-week prophylactic study on picornavirus respiratory infections, pleconaril was associated with an increase in menstrual irregularities. Subsequently, concerns have been raised that this drug might increase the metabolism and reduce the efficacy of some hormonal contraceptives and drugs used to treat HIV (Webster, 2005). As a result, pleconaril was not licensed by the FDA. An intranasal formulation of the drug is under investigation.",

With the notable exception of influenza viruses, there are no approved vaccines for the prevention of most respiratory viral infections despite continual efforts in this field. However, the immunoprophylactic agents RespiGam and Synagis constitute an effective strategy for the prevention of severe HRSV infections in premature and at-risk infants. Similarly, with the exception of anti-influenza agents, including adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) and neuraminidase inhibitors (zanamivir and oseltamivir), there are no other licensed antivirals against the large variety of clinically important respiratory viruses such as HPIV, HRV, and Ads. Although ribavirin has been approved for the treatment of HRSV infection, its clinical use has been limited by its side effects combined to its minor clinical efficacy. Because most respiratory viral infections are self-limited and due to the lack of rapid point-of-care diagnostic methods, the commercialization of antiviral agents against respiratory viruses represents an important challenge. Nevertheless, numerous antiviral agents have shown potent in vitro and in vivo activities against different families of respiratory viruses and merit additional studies.",
