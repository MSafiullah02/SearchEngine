For serious bodily harm, assault may be the crime charged. Acts that risk exposure but that do not result in actual transmission may be treated as attempts or as other offenses such as reckless endangerment.",

In some cases, the alleged offender acts with the intent to kill or harm by transmitting the infection. These are cases in which the infection is deliberately used as a weapon, just as a knife or a gun might be. In other cases, the offender acts with the knowledge that the behavior at issue risks exposing another to the infection and thus transmitting it, but does not intend the transmission and indeed may profoundly hope that transmission will not occur. Some cases of this type have been prosecuted as reckless endangerment, where the mens rea is criminal recklessness.

Statutes of this type have been primarily aimed at sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS in particular. The explanation for these special statutes may be disapproval of the sexual activity involved. In these statutes, the typical mens rea is the knowledge of disease status; these statutes do not apply to cases in which the individual did not know (or could not reasonably have known) his/her condition. As the actus reus, these statutes may list a set of behaviors thought to be exposure-prone, such as penetrative sex, needle-sharing, or blood donation. These statutes have the advantage of clarity in defining the offense, but may err in their understanding of behaviors that are high-risk and the nature of disease transmission more generally.",

As a contagious disease, HIV is unusual in that transmission requires an actual transfer of bodily fluids or tissues. For any particular HIV infection, moreover, the likelihood of matching victim and vector is far higher than it is in the case of transmission of many other contagious diseases. HIV therefore invites individualistic analysis: viewing a transmitter as a perpetrator to be punished if he or she meets appropriate standards for culpability. As we shall later observe, even if such individualistic analysis were appropriate for HIV, it is far less appropriate for the transmission of diseases such as tuberculosis, polio, or influenza through air, water, or fomites (objects such as a handkerchief or a blanket or the apocryphal toilet seat that can transmit infectious agents).",

In eighteen US states, crimes such as reckless endangerment, attempted homicide, or assault with intent to kill have been used to prosecute sexual conduct that risks transmission of HIV (Webber 2012, \u00a7 7.03). Some prosecutions for homicide or assault with intent to kill did founder on difficulties in proving intent or causation.1 But in cases of the deliberate use of HIV as a weapon, as when someone injects another with tainted blood, proof of intent is not problematic. Proof of causation may be more difficult if the HIV status of the victim was unknown before the injection or if the victim had multiple exposures around the time of the alleged transmission.2 Moreover, given the increasing status of HIV/AIDS as a chronic condition, the ultimate nature of the harm may be unclear; in making a decision about prosecution, it is likely impractical to wait to see whether the victim will die. These problems may be addressed through offenses other than homicide, such as attempted homicide or reckless endangerment, although the Commission was concerned that these lesser offenses would not adequately address the seriousness of the wrong involved.",

            "text": "Before the advent of HIV, many US states had statutes criminalizing the knowing exposure to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as syphilis or gonorrhea as a misdemeanor offense. These statutes were available to serve as a model for the new problem of HIV. In addressing HIV, a few states simply added HIV to the list of STDs in these statutes, but most enacted separate laws to deal with what was judged to be the more serious issue of HIV, classifying the offense as a felony rather than a misdemeanor (Wolf and Vezina 2004, 845\u2013846). The most common HIV-specific criminalization statute, adopted in almost half of the states, is a \u201cknowing exposure\u201d statute that makes it a crime for a person who knows s/he is HIV+ to engage in a list of exposure-prone behaviors, including specified sexual activities, blood or organ donation, or needle exchange (Webber 2012, \u00a7 7.03(H)). These statutes vary in important respects, however. Some state HIV-specific statutes group together behaviors that have quite different levels of risk.3 Commentators criticize these groupings as based in poor science (Presidential Commission 1988, 130\u2013131) and as failing to mirror actual culpability (Burris et al. 2010; Galletly and Pinkerton 2004). Statutes also vary in considering actual harm rather than risk of harm4 and in whether they require specific intent to transmit the virus.5\n",

Providing potential partners with information about infection status may discourage risky behaviors, but leaves this up to the judgment of the partner. On the other hand, statutes encouraging disclosure to partners may be more appropriate if the asserted goal of criminalization is retributive (Burris et al. 2010).",

Colorado13 and Kentucky14 limit the offense to someone who knows s/he is HIV+ either patronizing a prostitute or engaging in prostitution. Pennsylvania\u2019s anti-prostitution statute makes it a more serious offense for an HIV+ person to patronize a prostitute or to engage in prostitution and enhances the offense of procuring prostitution if the person knows that the prostitute is HIV+.15 In the main, these statutes also focus on the individual who is HIV+ as the offender to be singled out for punishment.

Indeed, UNAIDS advises punishing such actions under general criminal laws, rather than under HIV-specific statutes (UNAIDS 2004, 15\u201316). Among recommendations designed to reduce disease transmission, UNAIDS opposes criminalization in circumstances in which risks of transmission were low or protection was employed.

Criticisms include that punishment further victimizes those who have already been victimized. Punishment may be tainted by racial or ethnic bias; the majority of prosecutions in Canada, for example, have been against immigrants from Africa (Grant 2009, Global Network of People Living with HIV 2010, 16\u201317). Punishment may entrench norms of gender bias, particularly against women who risk oppression, persecution, or even death if they reveal their HIV+ status (Global Network of People Living with HIV 2010, 15). Some of the recently-enacted statutes in sub-Saharan Africa define the offense to include a risk of vertical transmission from mother to child, thus effectively criminalizing child-bearing by HIV+ women (Global Network of People Living with HIV 2010, 24\u201325) and arguably undercutting prevention (Ahmed 2011).

Diseases that are transmitted through air, water, or fomites such as contaminated surfaces quite likely do not involve one-to-one downstream transmission chains. To the extent that humans (and non-human animals, too) are inextricably interconnected in unpredictable forms of victim-hood and vector-hood, knowing exposure statutes will do little to reduce overall burdens of disease (Battin et al. 2009; Grant 2009). This is true even if the statutes would function as effective deterrents in the case of someone who did know his/her disease status antecedently, because such cases are too infrequent to reduce overall transmission efficiency.

Quite coercive public health measures applied to risky TB patients include detention and isolation for prolonged periods of time (Duffy 2009 (Ireland), Senanayake and Ferson 2004 (Australia and New Zealand), Oscherwitz et al. 1997 (United States)); prohibitions on immigration, emigration, or travel18; and deportation (Simmons 2008).

For these infections, powerful arguments have been advanced for significant measures to prevent disease spread, especially vaccinations, social distancing, travel restrictions, isolation, or quarantine (Clarkson 2010; Mok et al. 2010). With the attack on the World Trade Center, the anthrax attacks, and fears of avian influenza and SARS, commentators have defended controversial proposals for expanding public health powers in the US (Model State Emergency Health Powers Act 2001). These proposals, however, bring in the criminal law only to the extent that failure to obey quarantine or isolation recommendations is defined as a misdemeanor (Model State Emergency Health Powers Act 2001, \u00a7 604.). The use of infectious agents in bioterrorism has also drawn strong support for criminalization (Scharf 1999). Even here, however, commentators warn that a focus on bioterrorism risks distracting support from the development of the international infrastructure needed for prevention and protection of public health (Fidler 2002).",

Massachusetts, a 1905 decision upholding mandatory smallpox vaccination with a $5 fine for refusal.21 The common contemporary method for imposing vaccination requirements in the US is admission to school, however (Hodge and Lawrence 2001\u20132002). School-admission statutes have been enacted in all 50 states, with exemptions for medical reasons in all states, exemptions for religious reasons in 48 states, and exemptions for philosophical reasons in 20 states (Mahmoud-Davis 2010, 221). Despite the massive reduction in communicable disease transmission that has resulted from immunization requirements, exemptions are widespread and outbreaks are recurrent. Recent alleged concerns about vaccine safety have led to drops in immunization rates that threaten the viability of herd immunity. Distrust of governmental restrictions on liberty fosters vaccine refusals. Yet contemporary calls for criminalization of vaccination refusal are rare. At most, vaccination requirements may be enforced indirectly through the use of the criminal law to punish child neglect in the form of the failure to send children to school. In one reported example, after Maryland implemented a vaccination requirement for school attendance in 2007, parents of children in the county with the highest level of non-compliance were threatened with fines of up to $50/day and 10 days in jail if they did not get required immunizations (Hernandez 2007a, b).",

As members of the households where she was employed became ill, she was eventually suspected as the source of the infection and detained by N.Y. public health authorities. At the time of her initial detention, she did not know that she harbored the infectious agent, salmonella typhi. She was quarantined for over 3 years, then retrained as a laundress and released with the stipulation that she never seek employment as a cook again. Five years later, in 1915, Mallon was identified as the source of another typhoid outbreak, this time at a maternity hospital where she had been working as a cook under an assumed name. Mallon was once again quarantined\u2014this time for over 26 years, until her death. Overall, Mallon was estimated to have infected about 50 people, three of whom died.",

Nonetheless, her behavior was not treated as criminal and there were no calls for criminalizing behavior thought likely to expose others to typhoid.

We consider several types of transmission facilitation: trafficking in persons, deliberate failure to comply with requirements to report infectious disease outbreaks, deliberate discouragement or prevention of treatment, and deliberate discouragement or prevention of vaccination.

Traffickers thus engage in transmission facilitative behavior if they do not take care to ascertain the health status of those they traffic. This may seem the least of their wrongs in light of the harms to the individuals themselves who are the subject of trafficking. Nonetheless it presents risks of widespread harm to many. Some jurisdictions, as we have described above, have enacted statutes that enhance the offense of procuring prostitution if the procurer did not take steps to determine the HIV status of the prostitute. Statutes of this type focus on transmission facilitation, rather than on the behavior of the individual prostitute or patron.

The \u201cdonor\u201d country may not wish to punish those of its citizens who have traded their own bodily security for whatever money they could garner, however little. The recipient country has little interest in punishing a resident who has managed to fulfill his or her desperate need for a life-sustaining organ. With trafficking of sex workers or of labor, however, the incentives may be different for the recipient country. Enhancing the offense of trafficking when it involves facilitating disease transmission is defensible both as a matter of criminal law and as a matter of public health, although it would involve addressing the practical problems of enforcement that attend anti-trafficking legislation more generally.",

WHO may also receive information about possible public health emergencies from sources other than states parties; in such cases, states parties have the obligation to cooperate with WHO in verification of reports (WHO 2005, Art. 10). Suppose that state officials know of, but deliberately suppress, information about public health emergencies of international concern. Motivations might include protecting business, protecting tourism, or protecting their own positions (Forum on Microbial Threats 2010, 29).24 Although the International Health Regulations are legally binding on WHO and states parties, they have no specific enforcement provisions other than the moral suasion of WHO over states parties. This lack of enforcement authority for the World Health Regulations has concerned some commentators (Brady 2007). A 5-year review completed in May 2011 judged that \u201cThe most important structural shortcoming of the IHR is the lack of enforceable sanctions.

His denials persisted despite repeated pleas from scientists and South Africa\u2019s own HIV plan. In a speech to the 13th International AIDS Conference held in South Africa in 2000, Mbeki acknowledged that some viewed his stance on HIV \u201cas akin to grave criminal and genocidal misconduct\u201d (Cohen 2000; Specter 2007). Before the opening of the conference, Mbeki refused to assent to the statement in the Durban declaration that the HIV virus causes AIDS (Sidley 2000). Instead, Mbeki and several of his ministers promoted a traditional medicine, ubhejane, rather than anti-retrovirals, as treatment forms. Relatedly, there have been deliberate efforts to discourage people on a wide scale from participating in effective disease-prevention efforts. To take one example, in 2003, in response to pressures from religious leaders, political leaders in several states in northern Nigeria banned polio vaccination. The ban was based on fears that the vaccine would sterilize girls (Forum on Microbial Threats 2010, 27). The background to the ban included political and religious conflicts in Nigeria and the election of President Obasanjo, as well as a flawed test of an anti-meningitis drug, Trovan, which had harmed children in the area several years earlier (Frishman 2009).26 Wild polio remained endemic in Nigeria, and the epidemic ultimately spread to at least twenty countries, causing the overwhelming majority of cases of polio worldwide\u2014an estimated 80%\u2013and extinguishing hopes for eradicating polio in the near term.27\n",

            "text": "Finally, the importance of building trust cannot be underestimated in addressing the spread of infectious disease. Trust is especially crucial in the contexts of ongoing change that may characterize the identification and control of novel infections. Both infectious organisms themselves and scientific understanding of them may be evolving rapidly. Trust is important because information is easily rendered out of date as communicable disease continues to change and often rapidly. What is critical is always new information that can be reliably updated and is judged valid or confirmed. In short there is something of a dialectical relationship among the flow of information, quickly evolving epidemics, and the effectiveness of public health responses that may be disrupted by the ponderous nature of criminalization regimes. Trust is critical to the willingness to share information that may be needed to forestall disease spread. Moreover, trust underlies acceptance of disease control measures that impose costs\u2014including orders for isolation and quarantine. Without trust, people may be unwilling to share materials needed to identify sources of infection, antivirals, or vaccines. When criminalization singles out some but is ineffectual in reducing spread, it may paradoxically undermine the very trust needed to achieve its goals. The situation may be worsened by the apparent hypocrisy of states that turn diseases into crimes but at the same time devote half-hearted resources to public health and hamstring prevention efforts for moralistic reasons such as disapproval of same-sex relationships. Both the United States and other countries would do well to recognize that statutes criminalizing exposure to HIV/AIDS are an exceptional, and most likely counterproductive, development.",

            "text": "Much is expected of public health agencies. Agencies are charged to identify, contain, eliminate, or eradicate diseases that threaten the populations that they serve. Public health administrators may gather data intrusively, collaboratively, or passively. Public health agencies may devise positive incentives to secure the cooperation of those infected or judged likely to be infected with a disease. Public health administrators also may adopt strategies that minimize risks to the privacy of those infected with the disease in order to gain their cooperation in disclosing their condition. But in other times\u2014for example, times of complacency when the disease is no longer perceived as a threat to those most at risk\u2014public health agencies may undertake campaigns that draw dramatic attention to the danger of the disease and may seek to impose sanctions on behaviors associated with disease transmission. At times, such public health activities may focus on individuals, but within the context of interrupting disease spread. What matters most to public health is the imperative of devising flexible responses to deal effectively with the changing context of disease burdens. Such needed flexibility is lost if the state moves to criminalize disease transmission. Criminalization freezes in time what a public health agency can do in responding to the changing challenges that grave diseases present over the course of their existence.",
