Nucleic acid assays are key targets in biosensing that enables viral load monitoring and disease diagnosis [3,4]. Conventional assays such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), phenol-chloroform extraction and electrophoresis are reliable, but requires laboratory techniques that are time consuming [5]. Rapid disease diagnostic tests are however required for monitoring infections such as hepatitis, dengue, etc. [[6], [7], [8], [9]] Furthermore, developing countries often lack infrastructure as well as properly trained personnel to provide accurate diagnosis [10,11]. Recently, the concept of \u201clab on paper\u201d has generated significant interest for nucleic acid assaying due to its ease of use and cost effectiveness, especially for applications in resource limited settings [[12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]].",

            "text": "Conjugated polyelectrolytes such as cationic polythiophene have been explored for biosensing applications due to its unique optical and electronic properties [18,19]. The colorimetric response of CPE relies on conformational alternations in the backbone of the polymer [20,21]. The conformational transitions are usually followed by changes in fluorescence intensity and the extent of the conformational alternations in backbone depend on the energy required for interring twisting. Xia et al. [22]. suggested a strategy for colorimetric detection of DNA, protein and small molecules by incorporating water-soluble conjugated polyelectrolyte and gold nanoparticle with the target molecules. Although the target analytes could be colorimetrically ascertained for sub-nM concentrations, assaying in solution state is tedious and yields optimal responses only in a controlled laboratory condition [22]. Therefore, polythiophene-miRNA complexation on a paper-based platform for detection of mir21 sequence was first evaluated by Yildiz et al. [23]. The complementary peptide nucleic acid (PNA) sequence to mir21 was deposited on the CPE impregnated PVDF paper. Naked eye perceivable colorimetric responses were obtained at clinically relevant concentration ranges upon addition of mir21 in buffer solutions [23]. In a subsequent study, the colorimetric responses were evaluated by an image processing software that enabled quantification of nucleic acids in plasma samples [24]. Other reports for detection of oligonucleotide which are related to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and human papillomavirus (HPV) also indicate the potential applications for paper based sensors [25]. However, most of the current paper-based assays are dependent on either naked eye interpretation of colorimetric responses or an image processing software for analysis, which may introduce artefacts thereby inhibiting accurate quantification of colorimetric responses. Furthermore, conventional image processing software requires a server or a computer as well as several intermediate data transfer steps for diagnosis [26,27]. Recently, smart phone based detection methodologies have attracted significant attention [[28], [29], [30], [31]]. Herein, we propose a smart phone application algorithm that evaluates the colorimetric responses based on a pixel level analysis approach, enabling quantification of nucleic acids with high precision at clinically relevant concentration ranges. The algorithm analyzes color differences and retrieves the color profiles of the pixels of the sample droplet pattern of the CPE on PVDF membrane for reliable and sensitive interpretation of colorimetric responses. The CPE employed herein is cationic poly[N,N,N-triethyl-3-((4-methylthiophen-3-yl)oxy)propan-1-aminium bromide], referred to as PT.",

Hence, the orange color (HBV DNA-PNA-PT) and the significantly different pink/grey color (PNA-PT) enables colorimetric or naked eye detection of target HBV DNA. However, trace amounts of nucleic acids often yield weak colorimetric responses that are not perceivable by naked eye indicating the requirement of additional image processing protocols. In this study, an algorithm has been developed for precise interpretation of colorimetric response of PT on PVDF membranes. Experimental results suggest that the developed algorithm enables reliable determination of colorimetric responses that are not readily perceivable by the naked eye nor by conventional RGB analysis. The smart phone application based on the described algorithm has been developed and validated for the detection of HBV DNA. The algorithm could be installed in an application format on any smartphone with a camera for capture and analysis of colorimetric responses, and for enabling point of care nucleic acids assays in complex matrices. Furthermore, the proposed cartridge-based assay and smart phone application offer great potential for rapid and point of care screening of infectious diseases.",

In the first step, the algorithm locates the vertical centroid of the digital image via analysis of RGB components of individual pixels along the vertical direction. A horizontal red line along the vertical centroid is illustrated in Fig. 1a that corresponds to the 1000th pixel along the vertical direction of the digital image of size 2000 \u00d7 2000 pixels. RGB color codes of all the pixels are then recorded staring from the black PMMA frame that yield pixels RGB values as [0, 0, 0], whereas, non-zero values, for instance starting from [170, 110, 120] as shown in Fig. 1a, are recorded for the pixels corresponding to the PT deposited on PVDF membrane. Upon recoding RGB color codes of all the pixels along the vertical centroid, the algorithm records additional nine sets of horizontal axis pixel color codes, that correspond to four pixels above and five pixels below the vertical centroid in order to ascertain the colorimetric responses. The algorithm then constructs a 10 \u00d7 2000 matrix to determine red, green blue component of all the individual pixels along the scanning direction (Detailed description of image processing is provided in the supporting information; Fig. S1 (a)\u2013(e)). Finally, the algorithm executes an averaging operation to yield a pixelated color code that is displayed at the user interface in form of a bar chart.",

As shown in Fig. 1c, the red intensity profile centered at 250 drops significantly to 220 for the microstain region, assuring that the microstain with a slight color difference with respect to the background can be recognized by the smart phone application. The next validation experiments for the smart phone applications was conducted by creating an artificial droplet pattern as shown in Fig. 1d. The red, green and blue intensity profiles of the artificial droplet pattern exhibit two symmetrical minima corresponding to the outer and inner edges of the rim of the droplet pattern. These results show that the smart phone application is capable of recognition of both microstains and droplet patterns and might be subsequently utilized for colorimetric analysis of PT droplets on PVDF membranes. The red component exhibits the steepest change as compared to blue and green since the optical transition of PT is in the range of 500\u2013600 nm.

Fig. 4\na illustrates that the digital image does not reveal a definite droplet shaped pattern for membrane upon addition of HBV DNA, and that visual identification of HBV DNA is not feasible for lower concentrations (around 1 nM). However, BioRGB analysis yields distinguishable \u0394 RED signals for 1, 10, 100 and 1000 nM as 10, 25, 50 and 60, respectively (Fig. 4b, difference between control and sample). It is to be noted that the algorithm analyzes the response from all the individual pixels rather than by the averaging regions of interest, an approach adopted by typical image analysis software. As concentration increases from 1 nM to 1 \u03bcM, the color saturation and darkening occurs, and therefore the control spot (HBV DNA) and sample spot (HBV DNA + PNA) are distinguishable by BioRGB. As shown in the residual plot in Fig. 4c, the scattering of \u0394 RED values are 2.5%, which is larger than for the responses obtained in DI. The major reason of the increase in scattering may due to increase in refractive index (turbidity) in plasma samples. However, the scattering observed in plasma samples does not deteriorate the data-driven decision of BioRGB. Fig. 4b illustrates that the proposed BioRGB smartphone application possesses a scattering of less than 2.5% (reproducibility of over 97.5%) within the HBV DNA concentration range of 1 nM to 1 \u03bcM.",

The first control experiment perfomed with DNA1 (DNA1: 5\u2019 \u2013 TTT ATA GAA GTA GTG GTA CC-3\u2032 non complementary sequence to PNA) shows that the responses of DNA1-PNA are much lower than HBV DNA-PNA (see Fig. S2). This result demonstrates that PNA is specific to HBV DNA sequence. The interference experiment has performed in the co-existence of target HBV DNA sequence and DNA1. The result shown in S3 reveals that the non-complementary DNA1 does not associating complementary PNA as compared to target HBV DNA and the effect of non-complementary DNA1 on red intensity value is marginal. The response of the proposed assay to longer DNA sequence (DNA 31 = 31 base pairs) has been also tested since the real samples may contain longer sequence. The result shown in Fig. S4 demonstrated that red intensity for HBV DNA (shorter sequence) and DNA 31- PNA 31 (longer sequence) are nearly identical and this assures the proposed assay is applicable for the longer DNA sequences as well.",

RGB analysis yielded red intensity variations of 15, 25, 45 and 65 for 1, 10, 100 and 1000 nM of DNA, respectively, which are comparable to those obtained using BioRGB. However, these values tend to vary depending on the regions of interest that are subjective to human judgement. Furthermore, scattering intensities in RGB based colorimetric analysis are prone to be higher owing to manual section of pixels (as observed from Fig. S5, for concentration of 10 nM and higher), which compromises the overall sensitivity and robustness of the assay. In contrary, the proposed methodology eliminates the error involved in defining the regions of interest for image analysis approach and also yields a sensitive approach for analyzing colorimetric responses.",

The sensor approach is ideal for use in resource limited settings, where colorimetric response can be captured and interpreted using a simple smartphone. The smartphone application is capable of capturing and digitizing the colorimetric responses followed by an analysis of the individual pixels using an in-built algorithm. The proposed pixelated approach yields quantitative DNA concentration read outs, thereby eliminating the margin of error involved in conventional methodologies adopted for interpretation of colorimetric responses. The developed algorithm can be installed in an application format in any smartphone with a camera, for capture and analysis of colorimetric responses, enabling point of care nucleic acids assays in complex matrices. The obtained results illustrate that a ubiquitous smartphone can be utilized for colorimetric nucleic acids assays in complex matrices via the developed application that perform point of care without requiring sophisticated software nor instrumentation. Successful detection of HBV DNA was demonstrated in plasma, mimicking clinical samples, with a detection limit of 1 nM.",
