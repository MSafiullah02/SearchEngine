The model would technically suggest a negative correlation (e.g. colder days would be associated with more confirmed COVID-19 cases, and hotter days with fewer cases). Yet, these results could be highly misleading since these estimates are likely to be substantially biased because of the aforementioned reasons. number of estimated cases is given by the size of the circles as a function of temperature (x-axis). The circles in green correspond to the effects we are interested inthose that explain the influence of temperature on the spread of COVID-19. If temperature has no effect on the spread of COVID-19, then the green circles should be the same size at low and high temperatures. The pink circles represent the possible effect of temperature on testing (as reported in Table 1 ) under the illustrative assumption that high temperatures reduce testing frequency.
