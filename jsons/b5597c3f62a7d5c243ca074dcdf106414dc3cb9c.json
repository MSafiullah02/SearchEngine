If rickettsial infection is a possible diagnosis, doxycycline should be given (see Chap. 16 for further discussion on rickettsial infections). Patients with evidence of complications, hemodynamic instability, or severe dehydration should be admitted for supportive care, targeted treatment of the specific complication and intravenous antibiotics [1, 13] .

Glucocorticoid therapy has been shown to reduce severity of illness and mortality in patients with severe disease based on a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial out of Indonesia with a relatively low side effect profile. Therefore, if patients develop delirium, coma, shock, or DIC, glucocorticoid therapy should be considered with dexamethasone loading at 3 mg/kg IV followed by 1 mg/kg IV every 6 h for eight doses. Steroid treatment beyond this is contraindicated as it may increase relapse rate [23] [24] [25] [26] .",

Patients may endorse pruritus as well. With defervescence, a late cutaneous eruption develops, characterized by confluent and erythematous islands, which are often pruritic in nature (Figs. 23.8 and 23.9). The rash often resolves within 2-3 days but may last up to as many as 5 days. In addition, as the disease resolves, pruritic desquamation of the palms and soles may occur.

Signs of severe infection include abdominal pain, persistent nausea and vomiting, fluid accumulation (ascites, pleural effusion), mucosal bleeding, lethargy or altered mental status, hepatomegaly, increased hematocrit with rapid decrease in platelet count, and signs of shock or end-organ dysfunction. Aggressive IV fluid supplementation is warranted in those with signs of dehydration. Fevers, myalgias, and arthralgias can be managed with acetaminophen. NSAIDs and aspirin should be avoided, given the potential hemorrhagic complications. During the disease course, hemoglobin and platelets should be monitored. Transfusion with packed red blood cells is indicated for worsening anemia and suspected bleeding. Platelet transfusion is indicated for severe thrombocytopenia (<10,000/mm 3 ) but should not be pursued prophylactically.

            "text": "Patients infected with C. diphtheria usually present in one of two fashions: respiratory diphtheria or cutaneous diphtheria. Respiratory diphtheria is often caused by toxigenic strains, whereas cutaneous diphtheria may be caused by both toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains. Respiratory diphtheria often presents with sore throat, malaise, cervical lymphadenopathy, and low-grade fever. Early in the disease course, only pharyngeal erythema may be present, which then progresses to isolated areas of gray and white exudate (see Figs. 23.13 and 23.14; Table 23 .11). Although known as the hallmark of this disease, pseudomembranes form in only one third of cases. Pseudomembranes are easily friable gray tissue adhering to underlying tissue, composed of necrotic fibrin, leukocytes, epithelial cells, and organisms. These membranes can spread anywhere along the respiratory tract; however, the majority of cases are found along tonsils and oropharynx. Extensive spreading of these membranes can lead to respiratory compromise which will be discussed below [41] . Cutaneous diphtheria is often the more benign of the two conditions as systemic toxicity is rare. Early, patients may experience a small blister or pustule, often over a site of minor skin trauma, with straw-colored fluid that ruptures early forming a punched-out ulcer. These shallow ulcers usually become chronic, poorly healing lesions (taking from 6 weeks to up to a year to heal) that become covered by gray membrane. While initially painful during the first 2 weeks, these lesions often become anesthetic and develop a hemorrhagic or purple base (see Fig. 23.15 ). In addition, this variant of the disease tends to predominately affect the impoverished and intravenous drug users. Patients with cutaneous diphtheria rarely develop the respiratory variant of the disease but commonly serve as a reservoir of infection for others [42] [43] [44] .",

As with other rickettsial disease, infection induces a widespread vasculitis [51, 52] . Murine typhus is primarily transmitted via the rat flea, particularly in the developing world and in locations with large rat populations. However, any type of flea may carry and transmit the disease. In suburban United States, cats, opossums, mice, and shrews may host infected fleas. Humans are infected via infected flea bite. Most cases of murine typhus in the United States are reported in people from California, Hawaii, and Texas [51, 52] .",

In children, doxycycline is still the recommended agent of choice regardless of age. The recommended dosing of doxycycline in children is 4 mg/kg daily divided into two doses to be received every 12 h. Of note, fluoroquinolones and chloramphenicol may also be used but appear to be less efficacious. In addition, fluoroquinolones should not be used in children under the age of 18 years.
