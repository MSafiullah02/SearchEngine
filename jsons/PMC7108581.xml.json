Published reports of the number or percentage of research institutions that conduct health surveillance are not available, nor are there reports indicating whether institutions include more of their intramural facilities in surveillance programs. Facilities newly subject to surveillance may turn out to harbor previously unsuspected infectious disease. The current trend toward incorporating additional facilities into monitoring programs could thus foster the impression of continued disease prevalence as detected by the percentage of positive samples processed by diagnostic laboratories. Because data are not available, no conclusions can be drawn; however, any impact of more institutions beginning to monitor will be diluted by the great majority of institutions that already have routine surveillance programs. In addition, there has been no impact from institutions initiating health monitoring programs for other diseases such as M. pulmonis and Sendai virus.",

Long-term shedding of an agent that remains infectious in the environment for a long time makes elimination very difficult.

What is the problem with continued low prevalence of subclinical infections, especially if the responsible scientists express little concern?\u201d There are at least two important problems raised by low-prevalence subclinical infections. First, any nidus of infection in any part of an institution poses a risk of contamination to the remainder of the facilities. Second, many research measurements are increasingly precise, and some, such as various cytokines, are exquisitely sensitive to perturbation from even subclinical and transient infection. Given that for many viruses there is a dose-response effect, that not all animals will be exposed to the same dose or in the same week, and that response to infection varies among individual animals, even subclinical infections can increase variability in all parameters they influence. As a result, there is a growing clash between investigators who study subtle variations in metabolic, immunologic, or transcriptional responses and others who are reluctant to endure the cost, research delays, or potential changes in their models that might result from infection eradication campaigns.",

Again, the low prevalence of parvoviruses is an important factor: in many instances, only a very small minority of animals are infected, and among these the systemic effects are often subtle and relevant to only a few research areas. Effects of the virus on infected cells may be more significant (productive infection is cytolytic), but very few cells are productively infected so the overall effect on a tissue can be small. Therefore, for most research, any individual animal is unlikely to be affected, and effects on a small percentage of animals in a group are unlikely to change overall study conclusions.",

Contamination of entire lots of feed and bedding seems unlikely, given the generally localized nature of rotaviral contaminations (i.e., a single institution at a time), whereas contamination of entire lots of feed might reasonably be expected to result in nationwide outbreaks. A more probable, although unproven, mechanism of contamination is exposure of individual bags or pallets of feed or bedding to infected wild or feral mice. Mice have a keen sense of smell, and stored feed must be a powerful lure. Mice nesting on or near stored feed could easily contaminate the bags or contents with multiple agents.

Eradication of TMEV from research facilities depends on accurate detection of infected groups of mice, elimination of those that are infected (or shedding), and adequate cleaning and disinfection of contaminated materials. Prevention of recontamination entails the screening of incoming animals, disinfection of imported material, testing of biological materials, and proper use of PPE. Based on its moderate environmental stability, resistance to disinfection, and relatively long duration of shedding, the difficulty of TMEV eradication may be intermediate between that for parvovirus (more difficult) and rotavirus (less difficult).

In immunocompetent mice, enterotropic MHV causes clinical disease only in nursing pups of MHV-na\u00efve dams, so transmission of the virus by fomites contaminated by animals not known to be infected is likely a major reason for its continued prevalence. This problem is exacerbated by growth in the use of immunodeficient mice as well as in the use of genetically manipulated mice with unrecognized immunologic alterations (Barthold and Smith 2007).

Persistent and/or disseminated infection of enterotropic MHV in a wide range of mice with immunologic deficits (e.g., athymia, B cell deficiencies, interferon deficits) underscores the interactions with host defense mechanisms by even enterotropic strains (Compton et al. 2003, 2004a).",

Knowledge of egg longevity in the environment is important to determine the need for environmental decontamination, but specific data are unavailable. A. tetraptera eggs are thought to be long-lived in the environment, remaining dormant for several months at 4\u00b0C (Stahl 1966). Anya (1966a) reported, however, that culturing newly shed eggs at 37\u00b0C accelerated embryonation, decreased the number of viable eggs, and reduced their longevity. In a study to determine methods to inactivate viable S. muris eggs, 100% inactivation occurred only with temperatures of 100\u00b0C for 30 minutes and ethylene oxide, although high kill rates with formaldehyde and chlorine dioxide suggested that these chemicals could be successful with adjustments to the protocol (Dix et al. 2004). Huerkamp and colleagues (2000) reported the eradication of S. muris without environmental decontamination, suggesting that the eggs in the environment may not have outlived the treatment period (fenbendazole in feed every other week for five treatments). S. obvelata eggs appear to be unstable\u2014they are reported to survive only 42 hours under ideal conditions, and may be inactivated by drying or immersion in liquids (Chan 1952; Grice and Prociv 1993).",

Usual methods include flotation of fecal pellets in saturated salt or sugar solution for A. tetraptera (Baker 2007) and microscopic examination of clear cellophane tape applied to the anus (tape test) for Syphacia sp. (LeBlanc et al. 1993). Although centrifugation dramatically enhances the sensitivity of simple flotation of fecal pellets, many such pellets from mice with patent infections may be egg-free. A 24-hour cumulative sample is more definitive (Bunte and Nolan 2006). Tape tests may yield false negatives due to cyclic egg excretion in S. muris (Van der Gulden 1967) or a mature infection in S. obvelata (Clarke and Perdue 2004). As noted above, egg excretion decreases with increasing age and duration of infection (Behnke 1976, 2007; Chan 1952). For example, Baker (2007) refers to a study in which only 15% of S. obvelata\u2013infected mice were positive by tape test at 7 weeks of age, compared with 100% at 4 weeks. Given that sentinels are typically exposed to soiled bedding for several months, they may no longer be regularly shedding eggs by the time they are tested. In A. tetraptera, male mice harbor more worms than females (Behnke 1976) and worm count also varies by mouse strain (Derothe et al. 1997).",

S. obvelata infection induces a protective T helper cell type 2 (Th2) cytokine response, with elevated interleukins and circulating IgG (Agersborg et al. 2001; Michels et al. 2006), and these changes in host defense mechanisms can affect research unrelated to parasites. For example, S. obvelata\u2013infected AKR mice mounted an increased antibody response to sheep red blood cells (Sato et al. 1995), and S. obvelata\u2013infected BALB/c mice immunized against ovalbumin showed an increased allergic response to antigenic challenge (Michels et al. 2006). It has also been suggested that early infection with helminths may reduce subsequent atopy by increasing the proportion of Th2 to Th1 responses, although this is unproven (Mao et al. 2000; Weiss 2000). Studies have also demonstrated reduced incidence of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in nonobese diabetic mice with other helminths (Cooke et al. 1999; Imai et al. 2001) due to a switch to Th2 dominant responses, and a similar effect can be predicted with pinworms for the same reason (Franke and Shirwan 2006; Michels et al. 2006).",

Mice with abnormal P-glycoprotein, and thus ivermectin sensitivity, include a subpopulation of CF-1 mice (Lankas et al. 1997) and mice homozygous for disruption of the Abcb1a (previously known as mdr1a) P-glycoprotein gene (Didier and Loor 1995; Saito et al. 2001). Reports have described ivermectin toxicity in neonatal rodents (Lankas et al. 1997; Skopets et al. 1996), perhaps because P-glycoprotein protein expression in brain capillary cells is incomplete until postnatal day 21 (Tsai et al. 2002).

Although apparently safe, treatment with oral fenbendazole was reported to reduce litter size in Sprague-Dawley (SD) but not GEPR-9 rats (Johnston et al. 2006). Unfortunately, feed consumption and body weight were not measured, both of which could affect litter size. In addition, statistical significance was found only with continuous treatment of SD rats, in which there was dramatic difference in ages between groups: treated rats averaging 297 days of age produced smaller litters, whereas untreated rats averaging 142 days of age produced larger litters. Studies have found no effect (Barlow et al. 2005; Keen et al. 2005) or only minor effects of fenbendazole treatment on behavioral testing (Barron et al. 2000).",

The lack of an ovicidal disinfectant remains a major problem, as does the challenge of locating and decontaminating equipment that may harbor pinworm eggs. It is particularly important to decontaminate biosafety cabinets and change stations to prevent them from serving as sources for widespread dissemination. For A. tetraptera outbreaks, steam cleaning or scrubbing surfaces with detergent at frequencies of less than 5 days (i.e., twice weekly) should prevent the transfer of embryonated eggs from one user to another via fomites.
