The main regulators of leucocyte trafficking are chemokines, a family of chemoattracting cytokines that control cell migration and adhesion [1] . However, other factors, in particular extracellular cyclophilins, can also induce potent chemotactic responses in immune cells (reviewed in [2] ). We [3] [4] [5] [6] and others [7, 8] have observed that secreted cyclophilin A (CypA) is a potent leucocyte chemoattractant in vitro. In addition, CypA has also been shown to elicit inflammatory responses, characterized by a rapid influx of leucocytes, when injected in vivo [7, 8] . Based on the potent chemotactic properties of cyclophilins, we proposed several years ago [2] that extracellular cyclophilins might contribute directly to leucocyte recruitment during inflammatory responses and thereby complement chemokines as innate immunity factors. In studies aimed at establishing the mechanism whereby cyclophilins mediate their chemotactic activity, our group was the first to identify CD147 as the principal signalling receptor for extracellular cyclophilins [3] . Indeed, all human [3, 6] and mouse [4, 5] leucocytes examined to date require expression of CD147 for extracellular cyclophilindependent chemotaxis to occur.

It has been characterized under a variety of names in different species: OX-47 antigen [10] and CE9 [11] in rats, gp42 [12] and basigin [13, 14] in mice, HT7 [15] , neurothelin [16, 17] and 5A11 antigen [18] in chickens. In humans, this protein was first discovered by Biswas and colleagues as a tumour cell-derived factor stimulating production of a collagenase (matrix metalloproteinase type 1, MMP-1) by fibroblasts [19, 20] and was designated 'tumour cell-derived collagenase stimulatory factor' (TCSF) [21] . Later, it was found that TCSF is expressed not only on cancer cells, but also on normal cells [22, 23] . The same human protein was described in other studies as hBasigin, M6 or Hab18G [24, 25] . It has become better known under the name 'extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer' (EMMPRIN), because this property of the protein has been studied most extensively. For consistency, in this review we will refer to this protein by its recently adopted designation, CD147 [26] . CD147 is expressed at varying levels in many cell types, including haematopoietic, epithelial and endothelial cells [10, 22, 27] . It is up-regulated markedly on CD71-positive early erythroblasts, and in heart, placenta and thyroid tissues [28] . Human CD147 is a 269 amino acid-long protein that belongs to the type I integral membrane protein family with a predicted molecular mass of 27 kDa [23] . The N-terminal extracellular part of CD147 consists of two immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains that are heavily glycosylated [12] [13] [14] 29, 30] . Endoglycosidase F treatment leads to a mobility shift from 58 kDa to 28 kDa approximately, suggesting that the majority of CD147 glycosylation is N-linked [24] . Recently, another form of CD147, containing an additional extracellular membrane-distal Ig-like domain, has been characterized [31] .

Female mice deficient in CD147 are infertile due to the failure of female reproductive processes including implantation and fertilization [36, 37] . The implantation defect may indicate a misregulation of MMP production [42] . CD147-null animals also show a dramatic reduction in accumulation of the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)-1 and -3 proteins in the retinal pigment epithelium, supporting a proposed role for CD147 in targeting these transporters to the plasma membrane [43, 44] . The deletion of MCT-3 in the basolateral membrane of the retinal pigment epithelium results in severely diminished expression of CD147, confirming the functional importance of this interaction as a regulator of CD147 expression [45] .

However, another study, in which CD147 expression was silenced in Jurkat T cells, showed a reduction, rather than an increase, in T cell activation [47] . The reasons for this discrepancy are unknown, although it should be noted that the first study focused upon changes in intracellular signalling pathways and the second measured changes in cell function. Interestingly, the authors of the signalling study reported that the inhibition of NF-AT activity by CD147 was mediated exclusively by its intracellular tail, with no participation from either the extracellular or transmembrane regions [46] . Thus, variable outcomes between studies could be due to different functional parameters, regulated by distinct regions of CD147, having been measured. Additional support for a negative regulatory role by CD147 during T cell activation is provided by in vitro studies in which anti-CD147 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were shown to inhibit activation mediated by anti-CD3 [48] [49] [50] [51] , or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)/ionomycin [49] , in human peripheral blood T cells and T cell lines. Because the observed effects were functional in nature, anti-CD147 clones with a signalling capacity must have been selected.

Cyclophilins are best known as ubiquitously distributed intracellular proteins which were first recognized as the host cell receptors for the potent immunosuppressive drug, cyclosporin A (CsA) [54] . While most studies to date have focused upon the intracellular activities of cyclophilins, including their role in regulating protein folding, their function as molecular chaperones [55] , and the activity of CypA as a modulator of CD4 + T cell signal transduction and T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokine production [56] , accumulating evidence suggests a role for cyclophilins as mediators of intercellular communi-cation via extracellular sources of the proteins [2] . Some members of the cyclophilin family, notably cyclophilin B (CypB), contain endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-directed signal sequences that promote their secretion [57] . Indeed, CypB is detected readily in both human milk [58] and plasma [59] . CypB can also be released from chondrocytes by activated MMPs [60] . Cyclophilin A (CypA) has been shown to be secreted by cells in response to inflammatory stimuli [7, 8] and oxidative stress [61, 62] . Activated platelets have also been demonstrated to secrete CypA [63] . Unlike CypB, CypA does not contain any of the prototypical signal peptides found on most proteins undergoing secretion through a classical pathway. Instead, the mechanism of CypA secretion was shown recently to proceed via a vesicular pathway [62] . In these studies, CypA was found to localize to the plasma membrane of vascular smooth muscle cells following reactive oxygen species (ROS) stimulation, with secreted CypA protein detectable within 30 min of stimulation. Apart from CypA and CypB, no other members of the cyclophilin family have been shown to be secreted actively, although the possibility remains that some intracellular cyclophilins become extracellular due to protein release by dead or dying cells.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 286, "end": 290, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 475, "end": 479, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 604, "end": 608, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 753, "end": 756, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 919, "end": 923, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 978, "end": 982, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 994, "end": 998, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1063, "end": 1067, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1166, "end": 1169, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1170, "end": 1172, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1194, "end": 1198, "text": "[61,", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1199, "end": 1202, "text": "62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1269, "end": 1273, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1519, "end": 1523, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Cyclophilins: intracellular and extracellular activities"}, {"text": "The active site residues of cyclophilins have been demonstrated to be critical for both the signalling and chemotactic activities induced by these proteins.

Such a mode of signalling requires only a transient interaction between the ligand and the receptor, consistent with a low-affinity binding interaction between CD147 and CypA.

Interestingly, activation of T cells was shown to remove the dependence of CypA-specific responses on heparans [6] , suggesting that increased CD147 expression and/or dimerization in activated T cells may substitute for heparans by enhancing CypA binding to CD147. This result supports a model whereby cyclophilin binding to HSPGs is required to complement a low-affinity interaction between cyclophilins and CD147 expressed on non-activated cells.

In addition to its activities described above as a cyclophilin receptor and an inducer of MMPs, CD147 can also affect the activation and development of T cells [48, 50, 66] , regulate transport of monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) to the plasma membrane [67] and contribute to the blood-brain barrier function of cerebral endothelial cells [68] . Interestingly, these different activities appear to involve different domains of CD147. CD147 consists of a 206 amino acid extracellular region containing two Ig-like domains, a 24 aa residue transmembrane domain and a 39 aa cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 1a) . The extracellular region contains three N-linked glycosylation sites. The extracellular portion of CD147 is quite diverse, while the 24 residue-long transmembrane domain, represented by a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids interrupted by a charged residue (glutamic acid), is almost identical among different species [3, 69] . This structural feature of the transmembrane domain suggests a potential for additional functional roles besides anchoring CD147 in the membrane. Charged residues are not usually found in proteins spanning the membrane only once (as is the case for CD147), because a charged residue in the middle of the lipid bilayer is highly energetically unfavourable. Thus, CD147 has a propensity to form complexes with other membrane proteins thereby shielding the charge in an energetically stable state. Indeed, the transmembrane domain is responsible for many of the interactions between CD147 and other transmembrane proteins [70] , including b1 integrins [52, 71] , CD43 [72] and syndecan [73] (Fig. 1a) . Such interactions may contribute to the activity of CD147 in leucocyte adhesion [72, 73] . They may also be involved in CD147mediated signalling responses.

When association of CD147 with monocarboxylate transporter MCT1 was disrupted by mutating this glutamic acid, neither CD147 nor MCT1 reached the plasma membrane [78] , suggesting that CD147 might be a part of the heteromeric membrane complex involving MCTs. In support of this notion, a recent study [79] showed the association of MCT4, CD147 and b1-integrin at the basolateral membrane, and suggested that this complex CD147-cyclophilin interactions may regulate cell migration through modulation of focal adhesions. CD147 also interacts with caveolin-1 on cell surfaces and this interaction seems to regulate CD147 clustering and activity negatively, thus exerting tumour-suppressing activity [80] . Conversely, several reports suggested carcinogenic activity of caveolin-1 via up-regulation of CD147 glycosylation, which is linked to MMP induction and tumour invasion [81, 82] .

This signal seems to function only in some cell types (e.g. it was not recognized in human retinal pigment epithelium cells [83] ), suggesting that it mediates interaction with limited cell-specific regulators of protein trafficking. Future studies will hopefully integrate these findings into a unifying model of CD147 trafficking. Such a model will suggest not only new targets for therapeutic interventions in diseases where CD147 is recognized as a pathogenic factor [e.g. cancer or rheumatoid arthritis (RA)], but will also explain the role of CD147 in other biological processes, such as development of the eye or spermatogenesis [84, 85] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 286, "end": 290, "text": "[83]", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 417, "end": 421, "text": "[83]", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 929, "end": 933, "text": "[84,", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 934, "end": 937, "text": "85]", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CD147 and cyclophilins: structural and signalling aspects"}, {"text": "Addition of CypA or CypB to CD147-expressing cells initiates a signalling response characterized by Ca 2+ flux and activation of ERK1/2 kinases [3, [75] [76] [77] . Genetic analysis demonstrated that amino acids Pro 280 Gly 281 are critical for this signalling [3] . In addition, Pro 211 is involved in interaction with another cyclophilin, Cyp60, which regulates cell surface expression of CD147 [86] . Pro 211 is located either near the end of the transmembrane domain facing the outside of the cell or may be partially exposed and accessible to extracellular cyclophilins. Indeed, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies of the recombinant proteins revealed that CypA-mediated isomerization of CD147 stabilizes the rare cis-conformer of the Trp 210 -Pro 211 peptidyl-prolyl bond, potentially representing a 'proline switch' [64] . Thus, cyclophilin/CD147 interactions may represent the first discovered ligand/receptor interaction in which proline isomerization on the outside of the cell results in intracellular signalling on the inside of the cell. Although no direct interaction of CypA was found with Pro180 of CD147, there may be other mediators involved in sequestering cyclophilins to this site by way of ternary interactions. CypA forms ternary complexes with calcineurin and calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporin [87] , suggesting that a complex array of interactions may underlie cyclophilin/CD147 signalling. Therefore, interaction of cyclophilin with Pro 180 may be necessary for binding, whereas subsequent interaction with Pro 211 induces signal transduction. As with signalling induced by homotypic interaction between CD147 molecules, the mechanisms of cyclophilin-induced signalling remain unknown. Again, additional molecules that are associated directly and indirectly with CD147 appear to be involved in signalling, as the cytoplasmic tail of CD147 is not necessary for CypA-induced ERK activation [74] . Adding to the complexity of the issue, it remains to be determined whether ERK activation is in fact required for chemotactic responses mediated by cyclophilin-CD147 interaction, or whether some other signalling pathway is involved.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 144, "end": 147, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 148, "end": 152, "text": "[75]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 153, "end": 157, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 158, "end": 162, "text": "[77]", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 261, "end": 264, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 397, "end": 401, "text": "[86]", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 828, "end": 832, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1332, "end": 1336, "text": "[87]", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 1928, "end": 1932, "text": "[74]", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CD147 and cyclophilins: structural and signalling aspects"}, {"text": "While different CD147 domains are involved in MMP induction and chemotactic responses, these domains may be close to each other due to intermolecular interactions with other mediators.

In fact, multiple extracellular CD147 forms have been identified that include full-length CD147 associated with large microvesicles where CD147 continues to stimulate the secretion of MMPs and proinflammatory cytokines [88] [89] [90] [91] . Interestingly, the entire CD147 ectodomain as well as the individual Ig-like domains are cleaved from the cell surface by many of exactly the same MMPs that are secreted due to CD147 stimulation [92] [93] [94] [95] . The stimulatory activity of these extracellular CD147-derived peptides has been demonstrated recently. Here, the recombinant CD147 ectodomain that comprises both Ig-like domains (residues 22-205) was shown to stimulate secretion of MMPs [96] and proinflammatory cytokines [64] . The first Ig-like domain (Ig1 in Fig. 1a) and N-linked glycosylation are responsible for MMP-stimulating activity [23, 97, 98] ; however, how this occurs remains unknown. For example, CD147 Ig-like domains appear not to associate directly with each other at even millimolar concentrations [64] , suggesting that other protein interactions may mediate the proposed CD147 Ig1 homophilic association. Adding to this complexity, the CD147 Ig1 domain has been found to form a highly stable 'swapped dimer' , where one C-terminal beta-strand (residues 94-103) folds structurally into the other monomer [99] (Fig. 1b) . Although this appears to be mediated by two proline cis/trans isomerizations (Pro91 and Pro93), there is currently no evidence that CypA (or any other cyclophilin) mediates such an interaction or that this isomerization can occur spontaneously in solution [64] . Thus, how swapping occurs, whether CypA is involved and whether domainswapping underlies CD147 homophilic interactions remains to be seen. CD147 Ig1 domain-swapping may, in turn, result in a conformational change to other interacting proteins, similar to that of the cadherin family [100] . However, unlike the cadherins, there is no evidence of a monomer/dimer equilibrium for CD147 and all extracellular forms have been found to be monomeric. Thus, CD147 Ig1 domain-swapping represents either a misfolded form that rarely occurs for recombinant Ig-like domains [101] or there may be mediators of CD147 activity that induce domain-swapping and subsequent signalling. With regard to intracellular signalling associated with this cyclophilin-independent activity, experiments where purified CD147 was added to fibroblasts to stimulate MMP-1 transcription demonstrated a critical role of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in this activation [102] . Whether p38 activation is mediated by signalling originating from the cytoplasmic tail of CD147, or from a CD147-associated protein, remains unknown. In contrast, MMP-2 production by fibroblasts was shown to be dependent upon the phospholipase A2/5-lipoxygenase pathway, but not on MAPK p38 activation [88] . It appears that different signalling pathways leading to MMP induction can be initiated by CD147, suggesting a complex regulation probably involving two kinds of signalling molecules: those that associate directly with the CD147 cytoplasmic tail and those that associate with CD147 indirectly, via a bridging protein.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 465, "end": 469, "text": "[88]", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 470, "end": 474, "text": "[89]", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}, {"start": 475, "end": 479, "text": "[90]", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 480, "end": 484, "text": "[91]", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 682, "end": 686, "text": "[92]", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}, {"start": 687, "end": 691, "text": "[93]", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 692, "end": 696, "text": "[94]", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 697, "end": 701, "text": "[95]", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 941, "end": 945, "text": "[96]", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 976, "end": 980, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1097, "end": 1101, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1102, "end": 1105, "text": "97,", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 1106, "end": 1109, "text": "98]", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 1272, "end": 1276, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1579, "end": 1583, "text": "[99]", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 1852, "end": 1856, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 2142, "end": 2147, "text": "[100]", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 2422, "end": 2427, "text": "[101]", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 2808, "end": 2813, "text": "[102]", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 3118, "end": 3122, "text": "[88]", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1016, "end": 1024, "text": "Fig. 1a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1584, "end": 1593, "text": "(Fig. 1b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Structural aspects of cyclophilin-independent activities of CD147"}, {"text": "Given the multiple partners and activities of CD147 it is not surprising that this protein has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases.

CD147 stimulates MMP production by stromal fibroblasts and endothelial cells around the tumour, as well as by tumour cells themselves, through a mechanism involving homophilic interactions between CD147 molecules on opposing cells [88, 93, 102, 109] . Elevated levels of CD147 are detected in numerous malignant tumours and have been shown to correlate with tumour progression in experimental and clinical conditions [88, [110] [111] [112] [113] .

The MMP-inducing function of CD147 is also known to contribute significantly to tissue repair and remodelling during cancer development as well as several pathological conditions (reviewed recently in [121] ).

The presence of a cyclophilin inhibitor, NIM811, also reduced MMP-9 secretion significantly during the differentiation process. Conversely, the presence of CypA enhanced MMP-9 secretion by mature foam cells. CypA and CD147 were found consistently in atherosclerotic plaques of apoE-deficient mice.

A number of mechanistic details of interactions between cyclophilins and CD147 is still unknown and awaits further studies. In particular, it would be extremely important to refine our understanding of cyclophilininduced signalling through CD147. How does isomerization of Pro211 on CD147 initiate intracellular signals? What other sites on CD147, besides Pro211, are involved in signalling response to cyclophilin? Does this signalling involve any other proteins? What signalling pathways are initiated by cyclophilin and what are signal transduction mechanisms for these pathways? Answers to these questions would be essential for future translational efforts aimed at targeting cyclophilin/CD147 pathway. Indeed, demonstration that these molecules and their interactions play a direct role in different types of inflammatory conditions provides an attractive new target for intervention. Although reagents that block either CD147 or cyclophilin function were shown to be effective in reducing inflammatory responses in experimental models of disease, the specificity of these reagents is still quite broad, in that multiple functions of CD147 and cyclophilins were probably inhibited. The current challenge is to design therapeutic agents with the capacity to block specific functions of these molecules, while leaving other functions unaffected. In this context, a recent study reported the development of a small-molecule compound with the capacity to specifically inhibit the function of CypA, without any effect on CypB activity [159] . Similar approaches are under investigation to develop reagents that impact selective functions of CD147, for example by targeting different domains of the molecule.

(a) Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) induction is mediated by a homotypic interaction between CD147 molecules on different cells; chemotactic responses are initiated by interaction between cyclophilin and CD147. Immunoglobulin 1 (Ig1) domain is involved in MMP induction, whereas proline 211 and possibly proline 180 are required for interaction with cyclophilins and for cyclophilin-induced signalling. Glutamic acid in position 218 is potentially involved in interactions with other transmembrane proteins, such as CD43, b1 integrin and syndecan. The relevance of these interactions to disease pathogenesis is described in the text. (b) Potential model of CD147 homophilic interactions. A recently solved structure of CD147 Ig1 domain alone has revealed that the C-terminal beta-strand of one subunit is swapped with that of the other subunit[99]. It is still unclear how this process is regulated.
