            "text": "Around the turn of 2019, a novel coronavirus was seen as the focal cause of a cluster of symptoms that began in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly across continents with the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring a Public Health Emergency of International Concern known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), or coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). As of April 7, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported over 390,000 cases with over 10,000 deaths within the United States (US), and a cumulative incidence increasing from 8.3 to 418 cases per 100,000 persons [1]. Globally, over three million cases have been reported, with close to one million confirmed cases and 50,000 deaths in the US as of April 28, signifying a three-fold increase in cases over weeks [2]. Risk factors include existing co-morbidities while middle and older-aged adults are most affected, with the latter often displaying severe disease and higher mortality rates. Among its various presentations, neurological sequelae were seen in 36.4%, while 5.7% had acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) [3]. COVID-19 is known to have thrombotic complications in nearly 31% of critically ill patients [4]. Although a temporal relationship between COVID-19 patients and stroke incidence has not been parsed out, we present a case of a young patient with no risk factors who developed a severe COVID-19 infection and neurological sequelae. Short and long term outcomes in these patients are unknown [5]. We aim to strengthen the existing literature, explore the development of strokes in COVID-19 patients, and discuss strategies to identify patients at a higher risk to optimize resource allocation.",

On arrival, her vitals were blood pressure - 97/73 mm Hg, heart rate - 127 beats/minute, respiratory rate - 18 breaths/minute while saturating was at 95% on supplemental oxygen, along with persistent fevers despite acetaminophen administration. On exam, she appeared ill, uncomfortable, and in acute distress. Initial investigations were remarkable for hypernatremia, acute kidney injury (AKI), and bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph indicative of pneumonia (Figure 1). Ceftriaxone and azithromycin were started empirically with intravenous hydration, while nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 was obtained. Her hypoxia and fevers continued to worsen with increasing oxygen requirements, evolving hypotension, and tachypnea, requiring intubation and sedation with transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU).",

On daily awakening trials, she displayed significant features of confusion and encephalopathy. During saturation and weaning of her paralytic, new left-hand flaccidity was noted. The finding was subtle, and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) could not be assessed due to her inability to follow commands. However, brainstem reflexes were preserved with pupillary and cough reflexes to stimuli, the ability to trigger spontaneous breaths, and response to pain. Delays in obtaining an emergent CT scan of her head ensued due to her positivity for COVID-19 and an equivocal stroke-like presentation. After appropriate precautions were set up, the final read of the CT was unrevealing for an acute or subacute infarct or hemorrhage (Figure 3). At the same time, her last known well could not be gauged due to her level of sedation and fluctuating mentation, precluding reperfusion therapies. Atorvastatin and aspirin were started for secondary prevention, while COVID-19 labs were repeated to trend progression of the disease. A repeat CT scan revealed ischemic changes in the region supplied by the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) consistent with a cortical stroke (Figure 4). Follow up echocardiogram, and hypercoagulable workup was negative as seen in Table 1, including ultrasounds in the upper and lower extremities looking for deep vein thromboses (DVTs) to look for sources of thrombi (Figure 5). After remaining on mechanical ventilation and nasogastric (NG) feeding for a prolonged period, a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube were performed.",

SARS-CoV-2 has the propensity to infect the central nervous system, with autopsy reports revealing hyperemia and edema in affected patients [3]. COVID-19 patients with cerebrovascular diseases were noted to be at a higher risk for critical illness and multiorgan dysfunction based on previous reports from the SARS epidemic [6]. Amongst retrospective studies looking at the development of neurologic features during critical COVID-19 illness, 3.4% - 5% were found to have new ischemic strokes, with the youngest patient at 55 years of age [5,7]. In our patient with no apparent risk factors for a CVA and a young age, this case demonstrates that patients, regardless of their age, are at risk for severe neurological complications from this disease. COVID-19 is known to induce states of hypercoagulability by deranging pathways of hemostasis seen on thromboelastography (TEG) [8]. The viral load contributes to coagulopathy and endothelial dysfunction, similar to patients that developed strokes associated with SARS [5].",

She received a short course of therapeutic anticoagulation but was suboptimally given due to the lack of data guiding the use of anticoagulation in severely ill COVID-19 patients. Another explanation could be an exaggerated systemic inflammation or a \"cytokine\" storm, often a marker of severe disease manifested in our patient with increasing pro-thrombotic markers, including IL-6 levels. Blood cultures and echocardiography were unremarkable for signs of an infection, while carotid ultrasound with dopplers was negative for low flow states between the carotids. Studies looking at neurological manifestation in COVID-19 patients, signs were most commonly noted early in the disease course presenting with muscle symptoms and confusion, while d-dimer levels were higher compared to non-severe infections [3].",

Acute stroke management pathways have been delineated in COVID-19 patients keeping in mind practice patterns, resource allocation, and the presence of a large vessel occlusion (LVO).

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is known to induce states of hypercoagulability placing critically ill patients at high risk for vascular complications. Limited knowledge of the sequelae of this infection and guidelines leaves isolated case reports to guide clinical decision making, especially in patients exhibiting neurological complications. Despite being a disease that is known to traditionally affect the elderly, emerging reports of seemingly low-risk patients developing strokes are being published and thromboprophylaxis must be considered in seriously ill, high risk, or patients with high d-dimer levels. Encephalopathy is a frequently cited neurological manifestation of COVID-19 disease and can present as a sentinel sign for evolving strokes. Patients that develop strokes are at risk for suboptimal outcomes due to the diversion of resources to manage COVID-19 patients, while the development of acute stroke management pathways can help address these practice patterns. Further research is needed to parse out a temporal relationship between COVID-19 patients and the incidence of strokes including long term outcomes.",
