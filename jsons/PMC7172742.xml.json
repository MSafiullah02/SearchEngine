This surveillance is based on general practitioners and paediatricians who collect nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with S-ILI.

As expected, we showed that the risk of IV detection was higher during the influenza epidemic period, which supports the use of this S-ILI definition and the influenza epidemic detection method [13]. However, the proportion of S-ILI patients positive for IV was 48.0% over the study period and never higher than 76.0% by week (Fig. 1). Laboratory confirmation of virus infection by RT-PCR is costly and is not feasible in real time at the physician's office. Although an accurate aetiological diagnosis will require laboratory analysis, knowledge of combined observable factors predictive of viruses responsible for infection among S-ILI patients, might help to improve the rapid management of these infections. Analyses provided here are comparisons in relative terms, which should not be interpreted as patterns of incidence.",

However, some limitations should be noted. First, patients were included using a fever definition of >39\u00b0C, resulting in a high proportion of IV-positive patients (48.0%). This did not allow the study of milder respiratory infections nor of the impact of symptoms included in the definition. Second, we highlighted symptoms associated with IV detection without type/sub-type/lineage distinction. This choice was based on previous studies in France [2], although others reported that symptoms may differ with influenza types and subtypes [7]. In France, the 2015/16 influenza season was dominated by influenza type B viruses (among IVs detected 72% were type B and 27% were subtype A (H1N1)pdm09) [9], whereas the 2016/17 season was dominated by subtype A (H3N2) (98%) [25]. Third, only four virus classes were studied\u2014others such as adenoviruses or coronaviruses were not investigated. Fourth, we excluded the 192 co-infected patients (2.7%) from the analyses. As all of them were infected by IV, we compared these co-infected patients with those who were positive for IV only: we found that the co-infected were younger and presented similar symptoms, with slight differences: more dyspnoea, less malaise and less headache. Fifth, data collected allowed the analysis of neither the intensity nor the severity of the infection in terms of duration of symptoms or risk for hospitalization.",
