It is surprising how little we know about the domestic dog, considering its huge practical and emotional impact on human lives, whereas the wolf and other wild canid relatives have been studied in far greater detail (Serpell, 1995). Past work has focused mainly on the ecology of free-roaming dogs (for example Beck, 1973, Miller and Lago, 1990, Boitani et al., 1995, Meek, 1999), owned and stray dog populations in rabies areas (for example Matter et al., 2000, Kitala et al., 2001), or studied the individual behaviours patterns in dog\u2013dog interactions (Bradshaw and Lea, 1992). Most recently, the potential for contact between pet dogs was demonstrated through analysis of the public space used for dog walking (Westgarth et al., 2009a).",

            "text": "It can be observed that dogs interact with other dogs whilst out walking, through behaviours such as sniffing, play and aggression. Dogs may also interact with people other than their usual household members, such as other dog walkers. Opportunities for interactions might be affected by human preferences such as walk frequency and on/off leash preferences, the walking environment, and individual dog behaviours and type. In recent years there has been increased emphasis on the importance of socialisation (Hunthausen and Seksel, 2002), thus these interactions are likely to be socially beneficial for the dogs and will also enhance their welfare by providing stimulation and exercise (Defra, 2009). However, they may also present a risk of infectious disease transmission between dogs, for example in the transmission of upper respiratory tract diseases by contact with infectious discharges or by aerosol (Greene, 2006). Dogs may also investigate excretions and alternative food sources whilst on a walk and these might also be considered a disease risk. For example, the enteric pathogen canine coronavirus can survive warm temperatures for several days but seems to prefer colder temperatures and therefore may survive longer during winter months (Tennant et al., 1994). Feline parvovirus shed in faeces can survive in the environment for several months (Ikeda et al., 2002) and it is likely that canine parvovirus is the same. Campylobacters also manage to persist in the environment despite lacking many of the usual bacterial survival mechanisms (Murphy et al., 2006). Younger dogs have been shown to be at increased risk of Campylobacter spp. carriage (Sandberg et al., 2002, Wieland et al., 2005, Westgarth et al., 2009b) and one mechanism to this may be because younger dogs show more exploratory behaviours (Siwak et al., 2001). Although classical rabies was eradicated from the UK in 1922, there are concerns over re-introduction via imported animals (Defra, 2009). The epidemiology of rabies spread through pet dogs may be a future concern, as would be the emergence of a new virulent disease.",

Bradshaw and Lea (1992) recorded the behaviour sequences that occur during dog\u2013dog interactions in popular walking areas; after an initial approach phase, the majority of interactions consisted of olfactory inspections, in particular of the head and anal regions. Female dogs were more likely to concentrate on the head area and males the anal area of the other dog. These close-contact olfactory inspections are likely to be sufficient for infectious disease transmission. However this study did not quantify how frequently the interactions occurred, which is likely to be important in terms of both disease risk to the individual and subsequent transmission through a population.",

The effect of putting a dog on a leash may also vary depending on whether the other dogs in the environment are on or off leash. In support of this hypothesis, Bradshaw and Lea (1992) observed that no dog on a leash was the initiator of an interaction, and no interactions were recorded where both dogs were on leash. However their study was not specifically designed to assess the use of a leash in relation to the frequency of interactions. Putting a dog on a leash could be used as an intervention to reduce disease transmission between dogs, and also between dogs and people, during a disease outbreak. It may also be useful in reducing antagonistic encounters between dogs.",

It is also likely that dogs behave differently during interactions with familiar people or dogs than with strangers.",

The dogs were all familiar with the area and had walked the route at least once previously. The volunteer dogs recruited were all over 1 year of age, of various breeds, and the owner stated that they were comfortable walking the dog both on and off leash around other dogs. Data were collected between November 2006 and April 2007 between the hours of 8.30 am and 5 pm on both week and weekend days. Each dog was required to walk the route (in both directions) on two occasions, no more than 2 weeks apart, and at the same time and day of the week. In the first session the dog walked the length of the route off leash first and then on leash on the way back. In the second session the on and off leash walking was reversed, to account for any behaviour differences due to stage during walk (e.g. beginning/end) rather than leash use. However, it has been suggested that dog behaviour differs little between when they are first let free, in intermediate segments and on completion of their walks (Bekoff and Meaney, 1997).",

In particular, the use of a relatively narrow walking path in study two, rather than a larger open space where the dogs would not be forced to pass so close together, might suggest that there may be an even bigger reduction in contact due to use of the leash in more open spaces.

In our study, owners were more likely to pick up faeces when the dog was on a leash than off leash. This must be interpreted with caution, as numbers observed to defaecate whilst on a leash were low, but it may be easier to notice in this situation (or conversely harder to ignore).

The association between sniffing and urination was not surprising, as dogs can often be seen sniffing around the time of (and particularly preceding) urination, especially if the urination is for marking purposes. From an early age all canids investigate and sniff urine and faeces from other animals, in order to gain information about conspecifics, and may urinate or defaecate on, or roll in, other animals\u2019 faeces (Fox, 1984). Such close contact during investigation of faeces and urine of other individuals may provide an opportunity for pathogen transmission. Our univariable analysis suggested that if dogs were allowed both on and off leash more sniffing behaviours were performed whilst off leash, suggesting they may prefer to perform sniffing behaviour whilst off leash, or that stimuli that promote sniffing are less accessible when on a leash.",

In face of a disease outbreak, it would be important that everyone followed a leash-rule, if interactions were to be reduced to maximum effect.
