After the announcement of 41 confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Wuhan City, China on January 11th, infected patients were identified in Thailand on January 13th and in Japan on January 16th. More cases were confirmed in some areas of China outside Wuhan, including Beijing and Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province on January 20th, and the number of confirmed cases has continued to rise. Moreover, there have been reports of secondary transmission from China and countries including Singapore, Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam into Korea [1].",
