Indeed, the presence and number of comorbidities is associated with poorer clinical outcome in patients with COVID-19. In the study2 of 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, 261 (23\u00b77%) patients with COVID-19 reported having at least one comorbidity, with hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease being the most common. In this study,2 23 (2\u00b71%) patients had hepatitis B infection. Severe cases were more likely to have hepatitis B infection (2\u00b74% vs 0\u00b76%) than non-severe cases. Abnormal liver function tests, including elevated aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and total bilirubin were noted.2 Liver abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 might be due to viral infection in liver cells but could also be due to other causes such as drug toxicity and systemic inflammation.4 Data suggest that liver injury is more prevalent in severe cases than in mild cases of COVID-19.4 However, data about other underlying chronic liver conditions such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease, and autoimmune hepatitis, and their effect on prognosis of COVID-19 needs to be further evaluated.",

First, the Chinese IBD Society issued official guidelines for managing patients with IBD in early February 2020.9 The guidelines include practical recommendations on the use of immunosuppressive agents and biologics, diet, and intentional postponement of elective surgery and endoscopy, as well as personal protection provisions; these are outlined in the panel\n. Second, the China Crohn's & Colitis Foundation has organised a group of volunteer gastroenterologists that specialise in IBD to offer online consultancy to patients with IBD since Jan 29, 2020. Third, an online virtual IBD visit programme has been initiated in some IBD centres, which provides convenient and cost-effective care, and could potentially reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by avoiding close contact with infected patients in public areas. With the increasing concern from patients with IBD globally, helpful online resources about COVID-19 have been provided by international non-profit organisations such as Crohn's Colitis of Foundation America and Crohn's & Colitis UK.10, 11 Such guidance and advice should be delivered urgently to health-care workers as well as patients with IBD.PanelKey recommendations for managing patients with IBD during the COVID-19 epidemic\nPotential risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection\n\n\u2022Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on immunosuppressive agents\u2022Patients with active-stage IBD with malnutrition\u2022Elderly patients with IBD\u2022Patients with IBD frequently visiting medical clinic\u2022Patients with IBD with underlying health conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes\u2022Patients with IBD who are pregnant\n\nMedication for patients with IBD\n\n\u2022Continue current treatment if disease is stable, and contact your doctor for suitable medicine if disease has flared\u2022Use of mesalamine should be continued and should not increase the risk of infection\u2022Corticosteroid use can be continued, but be cautious of possible side-effects\u2022A new prescription of immunosuppressant or increase in dose of an ongoing immunosuppressant is not recommended in epidemic areas.\u2022Use of biologics such as the anti-TNFs infliximab or adalimumab should be continued\u2022If infliximab infusion is not accessible, switching to adalimumab injection at home is encouraged\u2022Vedolizumab use can be continued due to the specificity of the drug for the intestine\u2022Ustekinumab use can be continued, but starting ustekinumab requires infusion centre visits and therefore is not encouraged\u2022Enteral nutrition might be used if biologics are not accessible\u2022Tofacitinib should not be newly prescribed in epidemic areas unless there are no other alternatives\n\nSurgery and endoscopy\n\n\u2022Postpone elective surgery and endoscopy\u2022Screening for COVID-19 (complete blood count, IgM or IgG, nucleic acid detection, and chest CT) before emergency surgery\n\nPatients with IBD and fever\n*\n\n\u2022Contact your IBD doctor about potential option to visit fever outpatient clinic with personal protection provisions if temperature continues over 38\u00b0C\u2022Suspend the use of immunosuppressant and biological agents after consultation with your IBD doctor, and follow appropriate local guidance for suspected COVID-19 if COVID-19 cannot be ruled out\nCOVID-19=coronavirus disease 2019.
