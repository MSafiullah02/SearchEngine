The protein expression plasmid harboring the SCV NTPase/Helicase domain (pHelA12, kindly provided by Dr. Huang, J.-D. University of Hong Kong, China), which was constructed in the previous study [9], was transformed into E. coli RosettaTM competent cells (Novagen). The recombinant His-tagged SCV NTPase/Helicase was purified as described previously [9] with a following modification; after purification with a nickel-charged HiTrap chelating column (GE Healthcare) chromatography, fractions containing the protein, which was determined by 10% SDS\u2013PAGE, were ultrafiltrated with Amicon stirred cell (YM-30). During the ultrafiltration, desalting and buffer exchange was accompanied for the next column containing 180 ml of Sephadex G-100 resin (Sigma), which was washed with Buffer A (25 mM Tris\u2013HCl; pH 7.5, and 0.3 mM NaCl). After the protein sample (2 ml) was applied to column, it was eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate 0.3 ml/min. Pure fractions determined by SDS\u2013PAGE were combined, and the pooled fractions were ultrafiltrated with Amicon stirred cell (YM-30) for volume down. The purified protein in 30% (v/v) glycerol was frozen at \u221280 \noC for long term storage. Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay system (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard.

First, 5 \u03bcg of the RNA library was preincubated with 100 \u03bcl of Ni\u2013NTA sepharose beads in 100 \u03bcl of binding buffer (30 mM Tris\u2013HCl; pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 1% (w/v) BSA) for 20 min at room temperature with occasional shaking. The RNA-bead complexes were precipitated and discarded for removing RNAs with nonspecific binding activity to sepharose bead. In each cycle, precleared supernatant was incubated with 2 \u03bcg of His-tagged SCV protein in 100 \u03bcl binding buffer for 30 min at room temperature. One-hundred microliters of Ni\u2013NTA sepharose was added and incubation was continued for another 20 min. The reaction mixture was centrifuged to remove RNA molecules that do not bind the protein, and pellets were washed five times with 500 \u03bcl of the binding buffer. The helicase complexed with RNA was dissociated from the Ni\u2013NTA beads by eluting with the elution buffer (binding buffer components plus 250 mM imidazole). RNAs bound to the protein were recovered from the supernatant by phenol\u2013chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Recovered RNAs were reverse transcribed with ImProm-II\u2122 reverse transcriptase (Promega), amplified by PCR with Taq DNA polymerase, and used for next round of selection. Eight consecutive rounds of selection were performed in the same manner. However, starting from the round nine, a more stringent condition was employed by reducing the protein concentration at every one or second round: 1 \u03bcg (round 9), 0.5 \u03bcg (rounds 10\u201311), 0.25 \u03bcg (rounds 12\u201313), and 0.125 \u03bcg (rounds 14\u201315). After the 15th round, cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned into a linearized pGEM T vector (Promega). After subcloning and transformation into E. coli, plasmid DNA was isolated from individual clones and the DNA sequences of clones were analyzed. The secondary structure of selected RNA aptamers was predicted by the MFold program based on the Zuker algorithm [22].",

These RNAs were categorized as groups I and II, depending on the presence of the additional sequence of 5 nucleotides [GAAAG] that follows the AG-rich conserved sequence.

It was found that the predicted secondary structure of every RNA aptamer contains several stem-loop structures, in which the AG-rich conserved sequence and the [GAAAG] sequence mainly reside at the loop region in all the structures (Fig. 2\n). This result implies that the exposed [AAAGGR(G)GAAG] and [GAAAG] sequences in RNA aptamers are important for interaction with the SCV NTPase/Helicase. It has been previously reported that RNA aptamers for hepatitis C virus NS3 protease contains a conserved sequence of 9 nucleotides in the loop structure [18]. Thus, the loop structure containing a conserved sequence in RNA could constitute a binding motif structure to SCV RNA helicase whereas the stem structure of any sequence could have a stabilizing function.",

ATPase activity of the SCV helicase has been previously reported to be highly stimulated by single-stranded RNA [9]. We have confirmed the RNA-stimulated ATPase activity of the purified SCV helicase using RNA homopolymer (poly (rU)), and RNA concentration dependence on the ATPase activity was investigated (data not shown). Since the RNA aptamer pool constitutes a mixture of RNAs of 90 nts length, it may stimulate the ATPase activity of the protein if the protein recognizes the RNA pool as a genuine cofactor for ATP hydrolysis activity. As shown in Fig. 3\nA, ES15 RNA stimulated the ATPase activity in a dose-dependent manner with a K\n1/2 value of 2.34 ng/\u03bcl. This dose-dependent stimulation of ATPase activity was also observed with the random RNA library, suggesting that the SCV helicase hydrolyzes ATP by utilizing ES15 RNA as a RNA cofactor for ATPase activity regardless of RNA sequences and binding affinity. We next investigated whether the RNA aptamer pool could inhibit ATPase activity of the helicase in the presence of 100 nM poly (rU) RNA. As shown in Fig. 3B, ES15 RNA failed to significantly inhibit the poly (rU)-stimulated ATPase activity even at the highest amount tested. At a high dosage of the RNA aptamer pool slight decrease of the ATPase activity was observed. This is probably because the RNA aptamers might take over the binding of poly (rU) to the helicase and maximal stimulation of the ATP hydrolysis by ES15 RNA is less than that by the poly (rU) (data not shown). Averaged molecular weight of the aptamer pool (ES15 RNA) was precisely determined to be 30.2 kDa by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. 3C). Using the averaged molecular weight and K\n1/2 value of ES15 RNA for ATPase stimulation shown in Fig. 3A, apparent ATPaseIC50 for ES15 RNA was calculated to be 77 nM. This value indirectly reflects a binding affinity of the ES15 RNA to putative site for ATP hydrolysis stimulation in the SCV helicase. In the previous report of the RNA aptamers against HCV NS3 helicase domain, RNA aptamers specific to the helicase with high-affinity interfered with the substrate RNA binding without stimulation of the ATPase activity [19]. On the contrary, in our study both original random RNA library and RNA aptamer pool stimulated ATPase activity of the protein, indicating that the RNA aptamer pool against the SCV helicase can substitute RNA substrate in a competitive manner and play a role as a cofactor for ATP hydrolysis.",

            "text": "We then tested if ES15 RNA could inhibit DNA unwinding activity of the SCV helicase. dsDNA unwinding activity of the protein was measured by a fluorometric assay based on the FRET from the Fluorescein to the TAMRA (Fig. 4\nA). A similar approach for the helicase activity assay has been reported recently in the HCV helicase and the SCV helicase [7], [24]. Previously, it has been shown that the SCV helicase requires 5\u2032-overhang of the dsDNA substrate for its 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 directionality in unwinding [9]. Thus, we have designed dsDNA substrate with a 20 nts of 5\u2032-oligo(dT) overhang as described in Materials and methods. When the two oligomers are in very close proximity due to annealing, the FRET occurs from the Fluorescein to TAMRA, emitting a very weak fluorescence from Fluorescein. Whereas, an increase of fluorescence in Fluorescein dye may be observed due to the absence of FRET after the duplex has been unwound either by the heat denaturation or by the helicase (Fig. 4A). To ensure that the unwound oligoDNAs do not reanneal, an excess amount of trap DNA that is identical to the shorter strand (T0D25Flu) but does not contain the Fluorescein was included in the reaction. Thus, reannealing process has very little effect on the fluorescence of Fluorescein. Reaction condition was chosen to ensure that the helicase undergoes its dsDNA unwinding catalysis in a steady-state. As 5 min incubation of the dsDNA substrate and the helicase in the presence of ATP and Mg2+ is sufficient enough for the steady-state of DNA unwinding, effect of the presence of various concentrations of ES15 RNA or random RNA library was tested in the middle of steady-state phase of helicase reaction and compared to the control reaction where no RNA was added. Trap oligoDNA was added along with the testing RNAs to augment the fluorescence signal from 5\u2032-end Fluorescein of the displaced DNA strand.",

ES15 RNA inhibited the helicase activity in a dose-dependent manner, yielding helicaseIC50 value of 0.035 ng/\u03bcl (=1.2 nM) from the hyperbolic fit (solid line in graph, Fig. 4B). Remarkably, the helicaseIC50 value appeared to be smaller than the ATPaseIC50 value, indicating that the RNA aptamers more strongly bind to the helicase when the protein is complexed with dsDNA substrate rather than the helicase without dsDNA substrate. The random RNA library did not show a significant inhibition of the helicase activity, suggesting that strong binding affinity with defined sequences (i.e., conserved sequences in SE15 RNAs) to the helicase is necessary to inhibit dsDNA unwinding activity. Although the binding site of SE15 RNA on the SCV helicase is not defined in this study, the isolated ES15 RNA against the SCV NTPase/Helicase is a fully effective inhibitor of dsDNA unwinding activity of the helicase with IC50 of 1.2 nM, but not ATPase. Thus, we could speculate that the aptamers interact with the helicase either at a substrate binding domain for ATP hydrolysis or at an allosteric site to impede the helicase activity.",
