However, in Africa, ferns are highly diversified in the eastern mountain arc, and somewhat less so in the western mountains (Schelpe, 1983). Three main latitude groupings \u2013 tropical, Mediterranean and Cape \u2013 are usually used to describe the continental pteridophyte flora of Africa (Korna\u015b, 1993). Island floras include the Macaronesian flora, the flora of the Atlantic islands, and the flora of the Malgache region. The Macaronesian flora is mainly related to Mediterranean or Palaeomediterranean floras. Madagascar has an extraordinarily rich tropical flora with a very high number of endemic species, probably influenced by a very conservative climate. The flora of the South Atlantic islands is most closely related to that of South America, the sub\u2010Antarctic islands, and to a lesser degree to the Cape flora. A feature of this flora is their adaptation for long\u2010distance dispersal (Smith, 1972).",

Diversity and local endemism should therefore increase towards refuges because of their isolation and the maintenance of favourable climatic conditions. The existence of refuges has been questioned by several authors. The main arguments against them are Neotropical (Colinvaux et al., 2000), while those in favour are based on evidence from Africa (Linder, 2001). Based on the distribution of several groups of plants (Linder, 2001) and animals (Mayr & O'Hara, 1986; Harcourt, 2000), Africa is thought to harbour several of these refuges. There is remarkable congruence between centres of endemism and refuges, suggesting that the latter are not artefacts and that the pattern of African flora is well defined (Linder, 2001).",

Standard pairwise and stepwise multiple regression analyses (SPR and SMR) were used to determine the explanatory power of climatic and physical variables.3Independent SMR analyses were performed for large genera to show their climatic preferences, and in order to explain their distribution patterns. These analyses were performed using the relative contributions of species to each OGU and environmental variables.4The influence of dispersal and reproduction methods on the colonization of isolated marine or \u2018habitat\u2019 islands and on the evolution of endemism was assessed, relating the proportion of species with trilete spores and gemmiferous reproduction, etc., to environmental factors.5The floristic affinities among OGUs were analysed using non\u2010metric multi\u2010dimensional scaling (NMS) and compared with \u03b2\u2010turnover and inter\u2010OGU distances.6Patterns of endemicity were documented by performing several tests: (i) the determination of correlations between the number of endemic species and latitude to look for gradients in endemicity; (ii) the determination of correlations between the number of endemic species and the distances between OGUs, in order to study their isolation; and (iii) SMR analyses of the relative contribution of endemic species and climatic and physical variables, in order to determine these variables\u2019 explanatory power.7The consistency of floral affinities deduced from NMS analyses was tested. To phenetically classify biotas and to search for possible historical patterns, parsimonic analysis of dispersion (PAD) was performed.\n",

This is appropriate for the examination of general biotic similarity based on the number of common taxa (Sneath & Sokal, 1973). The matrix was then used to perform an NMS to assess the goodness of fit of the resulting spatial configurations with stress values (Kruskal & Wish, 1978). To interpret the plot, an MST was superimposed on the vectors to detect any undue distortion of the multidimensional configuration of the different OGUs (Dunn & Everitt, 1982).

Sites were used as characters and the presence or absence of species as states of these characters. Endemic species were deleted. All characters were unweighted and unordered. Fitch parsimony was used for all the assays. Data were analysed using the exhaustive option. Polarization of characters into plesiomorphic and apomorphic states was assessed using the standard comparison procedure with an outgroup composed entirely of zeros (Lundgberg rooting; Rosen, 1988). MacClade version 3.04 software was used to edit the data set analysed with PAUP (Maddison & Maddison, 1992), and also to map the distribution of particular character\u2010state changes. A recommended prerequisite for PAD analyses is to select areas with a comparable number of taxa (Rosen, 1988; Crisci et al., 2000). If areas with a very dissimilar number of species are studied, the sites with a lower number usually end up at the base of the respective clade. This apparent artefact is one of the main problems of PAD or parsimonic analyses of endemicity (PAE). Thus, sites with a low number of taxa should be excluded. In this analysis, OGUs with less than 45 species were excluded. Even if PAD analyses unveil hierarchical patterns among OGUs, they should not be used to search for historical patterns between areas, but only to phonetically classify biotas (Rosen, 1988; Crisci et al., 2000).",

The correlation between the logarithm of the species number and latitude was low (R = \u22120.41, P = 0.035) due to climatic heterogeneity and differences in area and elevation. The main climatic variable that changes with latitude is usually temperature, with lower latitudes showing high overall temperatures and weaker seasonal variations (see Appendix S2). But other climatic variables also depend on latitude, e.g. rainfall, moisture, the number of hours of sunshine per year and cloud cover. However, temperature can be also influenced by other factors. Moisture varies with longitude due to the effects of sea currents, but inversely on either side of Africa (Iriondo, 1999; Gasse, 2000). As expected, species number (logarithm transformed) is weakly correlated with longitude (R = 0.478, P = 0.011).",

These data indicate that these islands maintained a comparatively richer flora of ferns than other islands of similar area.

These are represented by a comparatively high number of species in Namibia, on Jebel Marra and on Table Mountain. They also grow in the tropical zone \u2013 at least the species adapted to inselbergs \u2013 on dry slopes and in other arid habitats (Reitsma et al., 1992). Some genera of this group grow in mountainous areas, where they reach high elevations. They are sometimes found in forests but never live as epiphytes (Table 9). Species such as Adiantum thalictroides Willd. ex Schltdl., Cheilanthes hyaloglandulosa W. Jacobsen & N. Jacobsen, C. eckloniana (Kunze) Mett., C. hirta Sw., C. multifida (Sw.) Sw., Pellaea calomelanos (Sw.) Link, P. boivinii Hook., P. quadripinnata (Forssk.) Prantl, Pityrogramma aurantiaca (Hieron.) C. Chr., P. elongata (C. Chr.) Pichi\u2010Serm., P. rupicola Pichi\u2010Serm., grow above 2000 m (Jacobsen & Jacobsen, 1989). Thus, in some cases, these Cheilanthoid ferns grow at high elevations in the microthermal region (Jacobsen & Jacobsen, 1989). They can be found in cloud forests, which rarely suffer water shortages (Bruijnzeel & Veneklaas, 1998; Foster, 2001), and in ericaceous brush. The abundance of ferns with xerophytic morphology in cloud forests is comparable with that of other plants (Flenley, 1992a, 1995). Bruijnzeel & Proctor (1995) and Flenley (1992b) suggest this morphology can be explained by exposure to harmful UV\u2010B radiation at these elevation. Reduced leaf transpiration, root respiration and nutrient uptake in these poor soils have also been proposed as compatible with the development of xeromorphic features (Hafkenscheid, 2000; Foster, 2001). The drought\u2010tolerant taxa are characterized by particular adaptations such as curling, and by being poikilohydrous or winter\u2010 or summer\u2010dormant. A revision of these life styles was published by Korna\u015b (1977). Some peculiar features include long dormancy with shedding of fronds, the protection of buds with scales and the bases of the stipes, resurrection after extreme desiccation, a geophytic life style, a very fast life cycle with a shortening of the gametophytic phase, and large increases in spore production and survival time, etc. (Given, 1993).",

This can be explained in that the Namib and Kalahari deserts are older than the Sahara or other African deserts. The Benguela current originated some time after the upper Eocene (Maley, 1996), causing the drying of the south\u2010western coast of Africa (forming the Namib and Kalahari Deserts), while the Sahara appeared as late as the lower Pliocene (Maley, 1980). The pronounced glacial Antarctic cooling that occurred during the late Quaternary was accompanied by intensification of the south\u2010east trade winds which caused stronger aridification along the east African coast (Shi et al., 2001). There are several other cases of arid\u2010adapted genera with their centre of distribution in Namibia which reach the Saharo\u2010Sindian deserts or the dry habitats of the Mediterranean (De Winter, 1971). These distributions are most easily explained if these taxa were dispersed from south\u2010eastern Africa to the North via an arid tract of territory (Van Zinderen Bakker, 1975; Coetzee, 1983). Until the late Miocene, the woodland savanna of the Sahara would have prevented the spread of many of these genera (Axelrod & Raven, 1978; Maley, 1996).",

The arc\u2010sines of the relative proportions of ferns with chlorophyllous spores, and those of gemmiferous gametophytes, correlated with the arc\u2010sines of humidity (R = 0.721, P < 0.0001, and R = 0.781, P < 0.0001, respectively).",

With respect to the \u03b2\u2010turnovers of the sites of Upper and Lower Guinea, the largest differences in fern flora were seen between Mt Oku, Annob\u00f3n, and Mt Togo; all other sites showed quite similar values. These three sites have a considerably impoverished flora with only 51, 42 and 39 species, respectively. This might be due to the lower elevation of their mountains (which also occupy a reduced area) and the drier climate (they lie beyond the equatorial forest zone). The largest differences between central and south\u2010eastern Africa were those of Drakensberg and Madagascar respect to the Kipengere Range (\u03b2\u2010turnover Drakensberg\u2010Kipengere = 0.656 and Madagascar\u2010Kipengere = 0.580; the number of species is 207 in Drakensberg, 336 in Kipengere and 542 in Madagascar).

The variables showing the greatest beta and partial correlations were inter\u2010OGU distance (B = 0.45, pc = 0.46, P = 0.020) and humidity (B = 0.54, pc = 0.45, P = 0.021) (R\n2 = 0.25, F = 3.89 and SE = 0.1).

The number of endemic species by ensemble of sites was, therefore, also plotted. These ensembles were Ethiopia and Jebel Marra, Upper Guinea (Loma, Togo and Kwahu), Lower Guinea (Bioko, R\u00edo Muni and Mt Cameroon), the islands of the Gulf of Guinea (Annob\u00f3n, S.

This suggests the island was a refuge for both groups, but that the flowering plants suffered greater isolation leading to higher endemicity (41.7% of ferns and 80.6% of plants are endemic, Myers et al., 2000). These results are not surprising as endemicity in ferns is usually less than that observed in flowering plants. Myers et al. (2000) reported a higher ratio of plant endemicity than Hobohm (2000). They also recorded data for birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians, most of which showed degrees of endemicity of around 80\u201390%. The exception was birds (55.4%) which is similar to the figure for ferns. These results might be explained by the superior dispersal capabilities of ferns and birds. They also confirm the important role of Madagascar as a refuge for most taxonomic groups. The extraordinary number of endemic species in Madagascar is not explainable by isolation, climatic stability or low competition alone; only a combination of these can explain the problem satisfactorily. This island seems to be a \u2018museum of endemic diversity\u2019 for many taxonomic groups including primates (Harcourt, 2000), amphibians (Bossuyt & Milinkovitch, 2000), butterflies (Torres et al., 2001), and plants such as Winteraceae, Canellaceae, Monimiaceae, Diegodendraceae, Sphaerosepalaceae, Sarcolenaceae, Asteropeiaceae and Medusagynaceae. (Leroy, 1978). Comparable patterns of high endemicity on islands close to a relatively depauperate continent have been reported for flowering plants, e.g. on the Canary Islands, Ceylon, New Guinea, New Caledonia, New Zealand, the Greater Antilles, or even the Californian coastal islands (Cronk, 1992; Medail & Qu\u00e9zel, 1997; Mueller\u2010Dombois & Fosberg, 1998; Baldwin, pers. comm.). In some cases, species currently extinct on the continent are preserved, have related taxa, or have even undergone adaptive radiation on these islands. Cronk (1987, 1990) suggested that Madagascar is a centre of \u2018reliction\u2019, meaning that groups of plants now extinct in all the remaining areas of their initial distribution continue to survive here. Such \u2018reliction\u2019 has also been reported on St Helena (Cronk, 1987, 1990).",

If the ratio between the number of endemic species and the total number of species is plotted against the logarithm of the inter\u2010OGU distances, the correlation is weak but significant (Fig. 7b; R = 0.404, P = 0.029). The sites were ordered according to the MST obtained from the Jaccard indices matrix used for multidimensional scaling (see previous section). If the observed values are plotted against those predicted, four sites are recorded outside the 95% confidence limits (CI): Madagascar, St Helena, Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha. Below the 95% CI are Jebel Marra, Namibia, Angola and Mt Loma (Fig. 7b). The latter OGUs now have either a dry climate or a small habitable area. The isolation of the central Atlantic and sub\u2010Antarctic Islands is sufficient to explain their impoverished flora and high endemic ratios. But this cannot be the case of Madagascar, which is too close to the continent to seriously impair the windblown arrival of spores; even large vertebrates have made the crossing (Mc Call, 1997). There are also large differences in endemicity in continental Africa, e.g. between the Eastern African mountain arc and Upper and Lower Guinea. These differences are at their greatest, however, between Drakensberg (4.5% endemicity) and Bioko (1.5% endemicity) (Table 1). Myers et al. (2000) indicated the eastern mountains and coastal forests of Tanzania and Kenya to have the highest endemism ratios in the world for flowering plants.",

Ethiopia and Mt Oku fell at the base of the two first clades. However, these sites have a rather impoverished flora, making it difficult to interpret their holding this position (Fig. 8). Three major components were also detected in numerical analyses of Zambian ferns by Dzwonko & Korna\u015b (1978)\u2013 the Guineo\u2010Congolian, Afro\u2010montane and Southern xerophilic elements \u2013 which essentially correspond to groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. These three large biogeographical areas seem to show good floral and climatic coherence. A consistent clade is that of tropical eastern Africa: Inyanga plus Drakensberg appears as a small clade sister of the main clade containing the Aberdare, Kipengere and Rukiya Ranges. The crown of the tree has Madagascar as its sister. The close relationships between Madagascar and Kipengere were also shown by NMS, as were those between Drakensberg, Inyanga and the Great Lakes sites. In the tropical western Africa clade, Angola appears as the sister of Upper and Lower Guinea. Mt Cameroon is closely related to the islands of the African aseismic dorsal (Bioko and S. Tom\u00e9) while the two continental areas of R\u00edo Muni and Mt Moukand\u00e9 (Gabon) are beside one another. These area relationships are also quite similar to those revealed by NMS analysis.",
