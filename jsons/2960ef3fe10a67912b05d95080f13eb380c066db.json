Automation of workflows in molecular diagnostics is instrumental for coping with the large number of tests ordered by clinicians, as well as providing fast-tracked rapid testing for highly urgent cases. In this study we evaluated a SARS-CoV-2 LDT for the NeuMoDx 96 system, a fully automated device performing extraction and real-time PCR. Methods: A publicly available SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay was adapted for the automated system. Analytical performance was evaluated using in-vitro transcribed RNA and clinical performance was compared to the cobas 6800-based reference assay within the lab. Results: The Envelope (E) Gene-LDT displayed good analytical performance with an LoD of 95.55 cp/ml and no false positives during evaluation of crossreactivity. A total of 176 patient samples were tested with both the E-Gene-LDT and the reference assay. Positive and negative agreement were 100% and 99.2% respectively. Invalid-rate was 6.3%.",

Particularly in the case of respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, clinical symptoms can be largely indistinguishable from other common respiratory pathogens such as e.g. Influenza (4) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are necessary to confirm or rule out the novel virus (5) . A variety of suitable assays were made available early on during the outbreak, notably by Corman et al. (6) and the CDC, which were swiftly adopted by many labs in Europe and around the world. However, their overall testing capacity remained limited (7) . We and others have previously demonstrated how automation in molecular diagnostics enables easy scaling of testing capacity by substantially cutting back hands-on time for PCR-assays (8, 9) .",

The assay demonstrates comparable analytical and clinical performance to established LDTs currently in use for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. Due to its random-access capabilities and short turn-around times (80 minutes), the system is well suited for automating medium-throughput routine SARS-CoV-2 testing, or as an addition to high-throughput systems to allow fast-tracking for highly urgent clinical samples.",
