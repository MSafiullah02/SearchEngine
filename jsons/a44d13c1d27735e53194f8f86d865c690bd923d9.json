Vehicle or remdesivir were given by intraperitoneal injection or renal injection through the left ureter in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mice. Serum and kidneys were harvested.

Novel coronavirus pneumonia is becoming a worldwide public health event due to the rapid increase in new cases and the high severity and mortality (1) (2) (3) . A latest research shows that COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit were older (median age 66 vs 51) and more likely to have comorbidities (72.2% vs 37.3%) than patients not in the intensive care unit, suggesting that elderly people or patients with underlying disease have higher disease severity (3). Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common disorder and the prevalence of CKD is around 10% in adults (4, 5). Thus, CKD patients combined with COVID-19 should be drawn enough attention from nephrologists.",

Another clinical study with 59 COVID-19 patients showed that proteinuria occurred in 63% of patients (9) . 19% and 27% COVID-19 patients have elevated plasma creatinine and urea nitrogen levels, respectively (9) . A consecutive cohort study with 710 COVID-19 patients further shows that the prevalence of renal impairment is high, which is associated with in-hospital death (10) .

There was no dead cells and cell morphology was normal at the highest concentration (100 \u03bc M) of GS-441524 when observed by microscopy. The protein expression of fibronectin (FN), phosphorylation of Smad3 (pSmad3), and alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) were assessed by Western blotting as markers for fibrosis. TGF-\u03b2 stimulation increased the expression of FN, pSmad3 and \u03b1 -SMA in NRK-49F cells, and dose-dependent inhibition of these fibrotic markers was observed starting from 10 \u03bc M of GS-441524 (Figure1B). The effect of GS-441524 on renal fibrosis was further studied in renal epithelial cells (HK2). 48 hours stimulation with 2.5 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2 increased the cell proliferation of HK cells as shown by CCK8 assay, and inhibition of cell proliferation was observed at 100 \u03bc M of GS-441524 (Figure 1C). Remarkable inhibition of FN, pSmad3, and \u03b1 -SMA expression by GS-44152 was observed starting from 10 \u03bc M of GS-441524 (Figure 1D). We further tested the direct effect of remdesivir in vitro. 24 hours treatment with remdesivir slightly inhibited cell proliferation of TGF-\u03b2 stimulated NRF-49F cells at 2C shows that 48h treatment with remdesivir significantly inhibited cell proliferation at the highest concentration of remdesivir (10 \u03bc M), and normal cell morphology was observed at this concentration.
