            "text": "More than 300 flavanoids have been isolated from Glycyrrhiza species and they are responsible for its yellow color. Especially, G. glabra has yellow color due to the flavonoids like liquiritin, isoliquiritin (Yamamura et al. 1992) . The flavanones and chalcones are the main types among these (Herz et al. 1998; Li et al. 2000; Zhang and Ye 2009) . A number of flavonoids have been identified in these roots such as liquiritin, liquiritigenin, rhamnolliuiritin, liquiritin apioside, gralbranin, glabrol, licoflavanone, isoliquiritigenin, neoisoliquiritin, licuraside, licochalcone A and B, licoricidin, 7-methillicoricidin, hispaglabridin A and B, liocflavone A and B, liocflavanol, glyzaglabrin, licoisoflavanone, glabroisoflavanone, glabrone, licoricone, gancaonin (Lou and Qin 1995; Xing et al. 2003; Williamson 2003; Zhang and Ye 2009 ). 5,8-Dihydroxyflavone-7-O-b-d-glucuronide, glychionide A, and 5-hydroxy-8-methoxyl-flvone-7-O-b-d-glucuronide, glychionide B have been isolated from the roots of G. glabra . The glabridin, galbrene, glabrone, shinpterocarpin, licoisoflavones A and B, formononetin, glyzarin, and kumatakenin isoflavonoid derivatives too are present in liquorice (Williamson 2003) . Also, hispaglabridin A and B, 4\u2032O-methylglabridin and 3\u2032-hydroxy-, 4\u2032-O-methylglabridin (De Simone et al. 2001; Haraguchi 2001) , and glabroisoflavanone A and B (Kinoshita et al. 2005) have been found in the liquorice roots.",

            "text": "In the 1990s, Fenwick and his co-workers have described two aglycone forms of glycyrrhizic acid, 18b-glycyrrhetinic acid and 18a-glycyrrhetinic acid. The anti-inflammatory and antiarthritic activity in animal studies too have been followed and attributed to the glycyrrhetic acid (Amirova 1993) . A speedy healing of gastric ulcers is attributed to the presence of glycyrrhizin and the aglycone of glycyrrhizin in the liquorice (Amirova 1993; Blumenthal et al. 2000) . Glycyrrhiza roots are reported to contain triterpenoid saponins (glycyrrhizin, glycyrrhizic acid). These are the major characteristic constituents of liquorice responsible for the sweet taste (Blumenthal et al. 2000) . The major triterpenoid saponin in the root of this plant is glycyrrhizic acid. Latter is the main sweetener in this plant, nearly 50 times sweeter than sugar (Nomura et al. 2002) . Other triterpenes too have been reported namely liquiritic acid, glycyrretol, glabrolide, isoglaborlide, and licorice acid (Isbrucker and Burdock 2006) . The described several saponins have been reported by Zhang and Ye (2009) from Glycyrrhiza species namely, licorice-saponin A3, 22b-actoxylglycyrhhizin, uralsaponin B, apioglycyrrhizin, araboglycyrrhizin, and icorice-saponin E2. In 2013, Vashist and Sharma have published data mentioning about the presence of ammonium glycyrrhizinate (3.4%) and calcium glycyrrhizinate (4%) in the ethanolic extract of G. glabra. Nomura and Fukai (1998) have published several reports on the phenolic constituents of Glycyrrhiza species. The main phenols include liquiritin, isoliquiritin, liquiritin apioside, and isoprenoid-substituted flavonoids, chromenes, coumarins, dihydrostilbenes. For example, isobavachin has been reported from Glycyrrhiza pallidiflora, sigmoidin B in G. uralensis, liquiritigenin in some Glycyrrhiza species by the same workers. Nomura et al. (2002) have investigated several Glycyrrhiza species from the point of view of phenolic compounds. They have found isoprenoid-substituted flavonoid (pyranoisoflavan, glabridin) (G. glabra), isoflavans (G. uralensis), licochalcone A (G. inflata, Glycyrrhiza eurycarpa), licoricidin (6), and licorisoflavan A (Glycyrrhiza aspera). Similar observations have been reported in 2003 by Williamson. Latter identified liquiritin, liquiritigenin, rhamnoliquiritin, neoliquiritin, chalcones isoliquiritin, isoliquiritigenin, neoisoliquiritin, licuraside, glabrolide, and licoflavonol. In 2008, Zhu et al. worked on the biologically active compounds of G. uralensis collected from Mongolia. They have reported 3 flavanone constituents (liquiritin apioside, liquiritin, and liquiritigenin) and 3 chalcones (isoliquiritin apioside, isoliquiritin, and isoliquiritigenin). In 2009, Zhang and Ye described several phenolic compounds derived from Glycyrrhiza species including glycycoumarin, glabrocoumarin, glycyrin, inflacoumarin A, licopyranocoumarin, isoglycerol, neoglycerol, licobenzofuran, licocoumarone, glabrocoumarone, gancaonin, and kanzonol. Isolation and identification of isoliquiritigenin from Chinese liquorice have been carried out by Chin et al. (2007) and liquiritin by Huang et al. (2010) .",

They have conducted enzyme or cell-based bioactivity screenings of 1-58 according to the clinical therapeutic effects of liquorice. A number of compounds have been reported to significantly activate Nrf2, inhibit tyrosinase or PTP1B, inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced NO production and NF-jB transcription, and inhibit the proliferation of human cancer cells (HepG2, SW480, A549, and MCF7). Glycybridin D has shown moderate cytotoxic activities against the four cancer cell lines, with IC50 values ranging from 4.6 to 6.6 lM ). Further studies have indicated that Glycybridin D (10 mg/kg) decreases tumor mass by 39.7% on an A549 human lung carcinoma xenograft mice model with little toxicity ). These workers have carried out studies to discover bioactive natural products from one botanical source of G. inflata. A total of 67 free phenolics have been isolated to form a compound library. Based on the licorice bioactivity, these compounds have been subjected to screening using cell-or enzyme-based bioassay methods. A total of 11 compounds have exhibited potent cytotoxic activities against 3 human cancer cell lines (HepG2, SW480, and MCF7), but have shown little toxicity on human normal cell lines LO2 and HEK293T. A number of chalcones have been observed to show remarkable anti-inflammatory activities. Out of these, licochalcone B, IC50 8.78 \u00b5M, licoagrochalcone C, IC50 9.35 \u00b5M, and licochalcone E, IC50 9.09 \u00b5M have exhibited the most potent inhibitory activities on lipopolysaccharide-induced NO production, whereas IC50 13.9, 7.27, 2.44, 6.67, and 3.83 \u00b5M have shown potent inhibitory activities on NF-KB transcription. Nine prenylated phenolics have been found to be PTP1B inhibitors. Particularly, licoagrochalcone A, kanzonol C, 2\u2032hydroxyisolupalbigenin, gancaonin Q, glisoflavanone, and glabrol with IC50 values of 0.31-0.97 \u00b5M.

In the same year, Frattini et al. (1977) found many heated liquorice compounds, the furan derivatives. The reason given for this is pyrolysis and condensation reactions which occur during heating, when sugars in liquorice roots are very rich. Acetol, propionic acid, 2-acetylpyrrole, Z-acetylfuran, and furfuryl alcohol are the most abundant components. None of the identified compounds alone are responsible for the flavor in liquorice. On the other hand, total extract shows a typical liquorice aroma, possibly due to an integrated response to the proper mixture of the proper volatiles, rather than to the odor of one or two components (Frattini et al. 1977) .",

He has reported compounds such as a-pinene, b-pinene, octanol, c-terpinene, stragole, isofenchon, b-caryophyllene, citronellyl acetate, caryophyllene oxide, and geranyl hexanolate. Out of these, geranyl hexanolate represents the higher percentage (34%) whereas b-pinene the lowest (1.7%). The phytoestrogens have been investigated in the roots of G. glabra from Syria by Khalaf et al. (2010) . They have identified daidzein, daidzin, genistin, ononin, glycitein, genistein, and coumestrol, whereas dihydrostilbenes from the root extract of G. glabra grown in Sicily has been reported by Sultana et al. (2010) . Wagner et al. (2016) have studied the application of the molecular sensory science concept including aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA) on the basis of gas chromatography-olfactometry combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. They elucidated the key odorants of raw liquorice (G. glabra) and found 50 aroma-active compounds via AEDA; 16 of these have been identified in raw liquorice for the first time. c-Nonalactone, 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethylfuran-3(2H)one, and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde have shown the highest flavor dilution (FD) factor of 1024. Nearly, 43 compounds have been quantified using stable isotope dilution analysis (SIDA); 6 more compounds have been quantified using labeled standards and odor activity values (OAVs), which is the ratio of concentration to the respective odor threshold. OAVs have been calculated revealing OAVs 1 for 39 compounds. The highest OAVs were shown by (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal, 5-isopropyl-2-methylphenol, hexanal, and linalool (Wagner et al. 2016 ). On the basis of the data obtained by these workers, an aqueous reconstitution model has been prepared by mixing the 39 odorants in their naturally occurring concentrations. The recombinate has elicited an aroma profile very similar to the profile of raw liquorice, proving that all key aroma compounds have been correctly identified and quantified (Wagner et al. 2016) . Ata et al. (2017) have studied the ion-pair extraction combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. They have proposed the determination of biogenic amines in liquorice samples (G. glabra). Their evaluations have revealed that limit of detection and limit of quantitation for the biogenic amines are 1.4-2.7 and 4.7-9.1 ng mL \u22121 , respectively. Relative standard deviations based on 5 replicate extractions of 100 ng mL \u22121 of each biogenic amine were <4.7% for intra-day and 7.4% for inter-day precision. The method described by Ata et al. (2017) has been in accordance with the satisfactory accuracy and good reproducibility for the quantitative determination of biogenic amines in liquorice samples. Nine biogenic amines (putrescine, cadaverine, histamine, spermine, spermidine, tyramine, tryptamine, agmatine, and phenylethylamine) have been detected in liquorice samples and total biogenic amine concentrations have been determined at 369 ng mL \u22121 in fresh and 3532 ng mL \u22121 in non-fresh samples. Putrescine has been found at the highest concentrations-up to 704 ng mL \u22121 in all the analyzed samples, followed by tyramine (675 ng mL \u22121 ) and tryptamine (282 ng mL \u22121 ). Putrescine, tyramine, and spermine concentrations have dramatically increased, whereas agmatine concentration has significantly decreased, in non-fresh liquorice samples compared to fresh ones (Ata et al. 2017) . Moreover, they have reported that the consumption of freshly prepared liquorice is recommended because of the relatively low concentration of total biogenic amines. Ye et al. (2017) have examined the bioactive constituents of G. uralensis leaves. Seven chemical components have been isolated by repeat column chromatography and using spectroscopic methods. Their structures have been determined to be a novel prenylated dihydrostilbene, a,a\u2032-dihydro-3,5,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetrahydroxy-2,5\u2032-diprenylstilbene, a methylated flavonoid, quercetin-3-Me ether, and 5 prenylated flavonoids: 5\u2032-prenylquercetin, 8-[(E)-3-hydroxymethyl-2-butenyl]eriodictyol, 6-prenyleriodictyol, 5\u2032prenyleriodictyol, and 6-prenylquercetin-3-Me ether. These compounds show strong radical scavenging activity toward DPPH, and most of them have demonstrated greater inhibitory activity against a-glucosidase than their unprenylated counterparts .",

It is also well known as one of the most frequently used herbs in China, as it has been in use in their traditional medicine for centuries. This herb is commonly used in herbal formulas to harmonize other ingredients and applied under 12 regular meridians in Chinese traditional medicine. As per the compendium of Materia Medica (Bencao Gangmu) liquorice acts as an effective antidote, a detoxicant, a beneficial agent in the development of bone and muscle, and a remedy for throat disorders and cough (Li 2003) . It is also included in many traditional Chinese medicine formulas for treating liver disease. Similarly, in Japan sho-saiko-to (TJ-9) is used for liver disorders (e.g., chronic active hepatitis), (Hirayama et al. 1989 ). This formula is said to have come from Xiao Chai Hu Tang (Minor Bupleurum Formula) in Shang Han Lun of TCM (Chang 1981) .",

A mixture of Ephedra, Cassia twig, bitter apricot kernel, and liquorice, known as Ma Huang Tang--a classic Chinese Formula has recently been confirmed to be effective in the treatment of pulmonary disorders like bronchial asthma, acute bronchitis, colds, and influenza. Direct effects of the bitter apricot kernel and liquorice are mentioned to be nonsignificant but, the two drugs have a significant synergetic effect when administered with Ephedra or Cassia twigs ). This clearly shows that liquorice has ability to harmonize with the other ingredients in the formula. Liquorice gargles are reported to be highly effective in the incidence and severity of postoperative sore throat (Agarwal et al. 2009 ). This confirms the findings for its use in traditional Chinese medicine. Some liquorice healing effects in the traditional Chinese medicine is fully confirmed by modern medicine. However, we still need to enlighten the fact which compound(s) in this herb mediate these effects (Kao et al. 2014).",

            "text": "The sweetness of liquorice comes from glycyrrhizic acid or glycyrrhizin, a triterpenoid saponin glycoside; 30-50 times sweeter than sucrose. It induces impulses from sugar receptor-containing cells at a concentration (3.0 mM), much lower than sucrose (Ahamed et al. 2001; Kao et al. 2014) . Glycyrrhizin maintains its sweetness after heating as against the sugar substitute aspartame. Although sugar and glycyrrhizic acid taste sweet, but glycyrrhizic acid induces a lower onset sweet flavor than sugar. Its sweetness remains in the mouth for a longer time (Kao et al. 2014) . Another triterpenoid in liquorice is glycyrrhetinic acid (18a-glycyrrhetinic acid and 18b-glycyrrhetinic acid) obtained from the hydrolysis of glycyrrhizic acid. Presystemic metabolism by intestinal bacteria performing glycolysis can complete this process (Ploeger et al. 2001) . The glycyrrhizic acid is metabolized by human intestinal bacteria through the action of the glucuronidases of Bacteroides J-37 and Eubacterium sp. to yield 18b-glycyrrhetinic acid (18bGA) (Kim et al. 1999 ). In the Chinese Materia Medica, dry-roasting or honey-roasting are the two processes used to obtain liquorice preparation which accelerates the hydrolysis of the sugar chains in the saponin and glycosidic flavonoid constituents (Sung and Li 2004; Kuwajima et al. 1999 ). Both raw liquorice as well as liquorice preparata are important agents in traditional Chinese medicine, each having different function. Anti-inflammatory activities and neuroprotective effects of roasted form is said to be more potent than raw one, which goes against the characteristics described by traditional Chinese medicine (Hwang et al. 2006; Kim et al. 2010) . As per \"Bencao Gangmu\" raw form can be used to treat the syndrome known as inflammation in modern medicine (Xie Huo in Chinese) , and roasted form for reinforcement (Bu Zhong in Chinese) (Li 2003) . The roasted form is used in Buzhong Yiqi Tang instead of raw, suggesting that glycyrrhizic acid and 18b-glycyrrhetinic acid may have distinct biological characteristics (Kao et al. 2014) .",

Multiple mechanisms have been proposed for the hepatoprotective effects of glycyrrhizic acid and 18b-glycyrrhetinic acid (Kao et al. 2014 ). The glycyrrhizic acid and 18b-glycyrrhetinic acid are reported to have an ability to protect hepatocytes from bile acid-induced cytotoxicity (Gumpricht et al. 2005) . A beneficial effect of glycyrrhizic acid on hepatitis has been demonstrated recently. The intravenous administration of glycyrrhizic acid is said to decrease serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and necro-inflammation and fibrosis in the liver (Manns et al. 2012) . The protective effects of glycyrrhizic acid and 18b-glycyrrhetinic acid are controlled by several mechanisms, which likely are involved in the reduced AST (aspartate transaminase, also called GOT) and ALT (also called GPT) activities. The glycyrrhizic acid can also modulate the pregnane X receptor (PXR), as well as cytochrome P450 family 3 subfamily A (CYP3A), to protect against lithocholic acid-induced injury ). The treatments with glycyrrhizic acid and 18b-glycyrrhetinic acid can inhibit liver fibrosis, which otherwise may lead to cancer (Moro et al. 2008; Kao et al. 2014 ). Both may be effective in the protection of other organs, as they have positive effects on brain damage induced by ischemia and 6-hydroxydopamine. A recent study has demonstrated that both of these can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) indicating that they are potent agents for the treatment of neural diseases, ischemic brain diseases, and Parkinson's disease (Kao et al. 2009 (Kao et al. , 2014 Tabuchi et al. 2012) . Glycyrrhizic acid also exhibits protective effects in the kidney. It has been demonstrated that it protects against cisplatin-induced genotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. The protective effects have also been observed with a renal hypoxia-reoxygenation model, however 18b-glycyrrhetinic acid does not exhibit the same potential (Yokozawa et al. 2000; Arjumand and Sultana 2011) . Glycyrrhizic acid seems to be effective against ischemic damage, including damage to the spinal cord, myocardium, liver, and gut (Yokozawa et al. 2000; Di Paola et al. 2009; Haleagrahara et al. 2011; Ogiku et al. 2011) .",

            "text": "Glycyrrhizic acid and 18b-glycyrrhetinic acid are considered inhibitors of inflammation induced by both bacterial and viral infection, as inflammation is frequently triggered by bacteria or viral infection, and antibacterial and antiviral activities are possible anti-inflammatory strategies. Former can inhibit the replica- (Takahara et al. 1994 ), hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Orlent et al. 2006) , herpesviridae (varicella zoster virus, VZV) (Baba and Shigeta 1987), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) (Lampi et al. 2001 ), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (Lin 2003) , cytomegalovirus (CMV) (Numazaki et al. 1994) , and influenza viruses, including H1N1 (Pompei et al. 1979 ) and H5N1 (Michaelis et al. 2011) . The glycyrrhizic acid also inhibits the growth of Helicobacter pylori, and thus can be used in the treatment of gastric ulcers, 18bGA has also been shown to be effective against clarithromycin-resistant strains of H. pylori (Chung 1998; Krausse et al. 2004) . Glycyrrhizic acid and 18b-glycyrrhetinic acid are also reported to modulate inflammation-related mechanisms. Traditional Chinese medicine often incorporates this herb to enhance the effect of other formulas that act as anti-inflammatory agents. Anti-inflammatory effect of liquorice extract is enhanced by glycyrrhizic acid without glycyrrhizic acid (Uto et al. 2012 ). Glycyrrhizic acid is reported to possess an ability to inhibit H5N1-induced proinflammatory gene expression without affecting the cytolytic activity of natural killer cells (Michaelis et al. 2011) . These findings depict that glycyrrhizic acid probably modulates inflammation by two regulatory methods namely, inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines and the promotion of immune function. In this regulation PI3K probably plays a role. The inflammation is very effectively modulated by glucocorticoids and the glucocorticoid receptor, latter is extensively used in clinical treatments (e.g., dexamethasone). Several potential mechanisms exist for the involvement of glycyrrhizic acid and 18b-glycyrrhetinic acid in the induction of cortisone activity. The two can activate glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling by binding to the GR and inhibit the activity of corticosteroid 11b-dehydrogenase isozyme 2 (11b-HSD2), which converts active cortisol into inactive cortisone (Whorwood et al. 1993; Kao et al. 2010; Ma et al. 2011 ). Both may also enhance GR signaling by eliminating intracellular oxidative stress (Kao et al. 2013) . No increase in the glucocorticoid-induced side effects is seen, although glycyrrhizic acid enhances glucocorticoid activity. Excessive glucocorticoid levels are reported to exert diverse effects on bone microstructure, integrity, and mineral metabolism (Iba et al. 1995) . It has been demonstrated that glycyrrhizic acid has the potential for use as an agent to protect the bones against glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (Ramli et al. 2013) . A nuclear component (high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) that functions extracellularly as a signaling molecule in acute and chronic inflammation has been reported to get inhibited by binding to glycyrrhizic acid (Mollica et al. 2007 ). According to Kao et al. (2013) , glycyrrhizic acid and 18b-glycyrrhetinic acid can modulate PI3K signaling to alleviate inflammation. All these results demostrate that glycyrrhizic acid and 18b-glycyrrhetinic acid possess considerable potential for development as novel inflammation-modulating agents (Kao et al. 2014) .",

Glycyrrhizic acid may inhibit angiogenesis by targeting ERK signaling, and can be protective against UV-B-induced carcinogenesis in the epidermis of SKH-1 hairless mice (Cherng et al. 2011; Kim et al. 2013) . GA also prevents hepatocarcinogenesis associated with hepatitis because it is effective against HCV-induced liver disorders (Ikeda et al. 2006; Ikeda 2007) . AS compared to GA glycyrrhetinic acid has a more potent anticarcinogenesis effect. According to Lee et al. (2008) , 18b-glycyrrhetinic acid not only induces apoptotic cell death but also exhibits a synergistic toxic effect with antibiotics and anticancer drugs like camptothecin, mitomycin c, and doxorubicin. The report published by Farina et al. (1998) reports that glycyrrhetinic acid, oleanolic acid, and ursolic acid have similar chemical structures and potent antiulcer activities. A satisfactory anticarcinogenesis outcome is found in the compounds whose chemical structures are similar to that of glycyrrhetinic acid (Csuk et al. 2011) . The glycyrrhetinic acid and its derivatives are highly effective in the treatment of many cancer cells as they are sensitive to treatment, including human epithelial ovarian carcinoma cell lines OVCAR-3 and SK-OV-3 Yang et al. 2012) , the human prostate cancer cell lines DU145 (Shetty et al. 2011; Szpak et al. 2011 ) and PC3, the human breast cancer cell line MCF7 (Sharma et al. 2012; Zhao et al. 2012) , the human bladder cancer cell line NTUB1 , the human leukemia cell line HL60 , the human erythromyeloblastoid leukemia cell line K562 , the human colon cancer cell lines RKO and SW480 ), the pancreatic cancer cell lines Panc1 and Panc28 , and many other cell lines. 18b-glycyrrhetinic acid is more toxic than glycyrrhizic acid, glycyrrhizic acid displays no obvious cell toxicity, even at 200 lM (Kao et al. 2009 (Kao et al. , 2010 (Kao et al. , 2013 .",

Studies on their antioxidant abilities are limited. These compounds are reported to be the potent protective agents against cancer and all four compounds may have a potent antispasmodic effect (Lee et al. 2013) . These four compounds are said to play an important role in healing effects, their chemical structures are similar, a simultaneous study on these compounds may facilitate the elucidation of the relationship between their biological effects and structure (Kamei et al. 2005; Kao et al. 2014) . The biological functions of liquiritin are similar to those of glycyrrhizic acid. Liquiritin promotes neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells with nerve growth factor treatment (Chen et al. 2009 ), suggesting its potential as a remedy for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, liquiritin may exhibit an antidepressant-like effect in chronic variable stress-induced depression model rats by modulating oxidative stress (Zhao et al. 2008 ). It proves beneficial in patients with diabetes mellitus because it attenuates the induction of the RAGE/NFjB pathway in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by advanced glycation end products (AGE), (Zhang et al. 2013 ). According to Cheel et al. (2010) , liquiritin and glycyrrhizic acid can stimulate immune responses, enhance antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutases (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase in mice focal cerebrum ). These may act as protective agents against epithelial injury in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) . Liquiritin may bind to DNA like glycyrrhizic acid ) and may directly affect gene expression or other DNA-related mechanisms. Both are glycones or glycosides, the functional groups important for DNA binding, but this characterization is yet to be confirmed (Kao et al. 2014) .",

            "text": "The IC50 values of these compounds are 49.3 and 55.8 lM for liquiritigenin and isoliquiritigenin respectively. Both are effective anti-inflammatory agents displaying potential PPARc activating activity, suggesting their potential for use in recovery from metabolic syndrome ). Latter is also an inhibitor of aldose reductase, suggesting it might be effective in treating diabetic complications (Aida et al. 1990 ). Liquiritigenin inhibits iNOS and proinflammatory cytokines by blocking NFjB , while isoliquiritigenin is involved in the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) to modulate inflammation (Tanaka et al. 2001 ). Liquiritigenin has a protective role against a number of injuries in many cells and organs, including acetaminophen-induced rat liver damage, cadmium-induced rat hepatoma Reuber H35 cell (H4IIE) damage, D-galactosamine/ lipopolysaccharide-or CCl4-mediated rat hepatitis, Ab(25-35)-induced injury of rat hippocampal neurons, and infection by Candida albicans (Kim et al. 2004 (Kim et al. , 2006 Lee et al. 2009; Liu et al. 2009; Kang et al. 2010a ). On the other hand isoliquiritigenin also protects cells and organs by inhibiting cisplatin-induced rat anorexia, the diabetes-induced hyperaggregability of platelets, the accumulation of cyclic AMP in rat ventricular heart muscle, and by potently promoting neuronal health by inhibiting monoamine oxidase A and B among other mechanisms (Tawata et al. 1992; Wegener and Nawrath 1997; Pan et al. 2000; Takeda et al. 2008) . Liquiritigenin can enhance bile secretion in the liver through choleretic effect and can enhance the activity of transporters and phase II enzymes in the liver, which is thought to be related to the antidote ability of liquorice (Kim et al. 2009 ). In addition to an increase in the bile secretion, it might increase the rate of hepatic blood flow, and may exhibit chemopreventive activity in liver and lung cancers Jayaprakasam et al. 2009; Kang et al. 2010b; Zhou et al. 2010) . The mechanisms by which it modulates chemoprevention may involve apoptotic molecular targets, like cytochrome c, caspases, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), PI3K, Akt, and vascularization (Liu et al. 2011 Xie et al. 2012 ). C8-prenylation of a flavonoid such as liquiritigenin may enhance the induction of H4IIE and C6 glioma cell apoptosis without affecting its antioxidative properties (Watjen et al. 2007) . This compound has been reported to inhibit lipoxygenase and prostaglandin E2 (PEG2), induce cell cycle arrest in the human prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and LNCaP cells, induce cell death in the human breast cancer cell line MCF7 at high concentration, suppress pulmonary metastasis of mouse renal cell carcinoma, inhibit human lung cancer cell growth, inhibit colon cancer in ddY mice, induce apoptosis in human MGC803 gastric cancer cells, and activate the apoptosis in hepatoma cells among other effects in cancer cell, and therefore liquiritigenin is a potent protectant in cells and organs, whereas isoliquiritigenin exhibits greater potential in cancer chemoprevention (Yamamoto et al. 1991; Ma et al. 2001; Baba et al. 2002; Maggiolini et al. 2002; Yamazaki et al. 2002; Kanazawa et al. 2003; Takahashi et al. 2004; Ii et al. 2004; Hsu et al. 2005a, b; Kao et al. 2014) .",

The isoangustone A, another phenylflavonoid has also been identified, with lower antioxidant activity than that of DGD (Lee et al. 2010b, c; Kim et al. 2012a) . Both DGC as well as DGD are potent ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor c (PPARc), which is thought to play a role in metabolic syndrome. The liquorice ethanolic extract containing DGC and DGD when used for the treatment in KK-Ay and obese C57BL mice has been observed to prevent and ameliorate metabolic syndrome in diabetic forms (Mae et al. 2003) . According to Seo et al. (2010) , DGC is not only a ligand of PPARc but also an activating factor of Nrf2 and detoxifying enzymes. It also modulates PI3K/Akt and Nrf2-Keap1 to protect against glutamate-induced neuronal cell damage (Kim et al. 2012b) . Both DGC and DGD are relatively newly isolated compounds from liquorice and exhibit various potent activities, but further study of their biology and toxicity is needed (Kao et al. 2014) .",

Glabridin might modulate bone disorders in postmenopausal women and increase osteoblastic cell function (Somjen et al. 2004; Choi 2005) . Although a potent antioxidant, its brain penetration through the BBB is altered by p-glycoprotein, which might limit its application in central nervous system (CNS) diseases (Yu et al. 2007 ). The main application of glabridin seems to be in cosmetics. The antioxidant ability can help to modulate anti-inflammatory mechanisms in skin tissue (Kao et al. 2014) . The clinical studies are lacking however, some commercial formulations with liquorice extract claim that glabridin is useful for skin depigmentation (Leyden et al. 2011) . According to Jirawattanapong et al. (2009) , glabridin and its derivatives inhibit tyrosinase. There are reports of a reduction in UV-B-induced pigmentation and erythema in brownish guinea pigs after glabridin administration for 3 weeks following UV-B irradiation (Yokota et al. 1998 ). In addition to this potent anti-inflammatory activity, it has been reported to inhibit inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and upregulate manganese SOD, catalase, and paraoxonase 2 expression (Kang et al. 2005; Yehuda et al. 2011) .",

Its most important characteristic is sterol regulation, which is involved in its effectiveness in the prevention of fatty liver (Rhee et al. 2012 ). This compound might have a nootropic effect due to the regulatory ability of glucocorticoids, thus improving verbal fluency and verbal memory in humans (Sandeep et al. 2004 ). The quotes from traditional Chinese medicine \"Bencao Gangmu\" state that liquorice consumption may enhance memory.

The gap junctions are also related to pain control. The reason being the spinal cord glia exhibits extensive gap junctional connectivity, which is involved in the contralateral spread of excitation resulting in mirror image pain (Spataro et al. 2004) . Carbenoxolone is also an inhibitor of gap junctions, its application in pain relief seems reasonable. Connexin gap junction proteins (Cx43 and Cx26) initiate brain metastatic lesion formation in association with the vasculature. It can prevent tumor cell extravasation and blood vessel involvement (Stoletov et al. 2013 ) and is frequently used in cancer research to probe the relationship between gap junctions and cancer formation. A typical study is the relationship between gap function and breast cancer metastasis or melanoma brain colonization (Stoletov et al. 2013 ).
