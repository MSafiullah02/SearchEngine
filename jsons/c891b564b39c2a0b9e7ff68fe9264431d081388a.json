            "text": "Background: Leptospirosis is a potentially fatal zoonosis. It can cause a wide range of symptoms, including diffuse alveolar haemorrhage which occurs in a minority of cases but carries a mortality of over 70%. These patients may present with severe acute respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis for diffuse alveolar haemorrhage is broad whereas prompt diagnosis and treatment can be lifesaving. Case presentation: A 20-year-old previously fit and well trout farm worker presented with a 3-day history of malaise, fevers, diarrhoea, vomiting and jaundice. He developed haemoptysis, severe headaches, neck stiffness and photophobia on the day of emergency admission. He was anaemic and thrombocytopenic. Anuric acute kidney injury (urea 32, creat 507) required immediate haemofiltration. In view of progressive respiratory failure with fourquadrant lung infiltrates on imaging, he was given broad spectrum antibiotics and pulsed methylprednisolone empirically, in case of a vasculitic pulmonary-renal presentation. He was intubated within 48 h of admission. Despite attempted protective ventilatory management, he remained hypoxaemic and developed pneumomediastinum. He was retrieved to a specialist cardiorespiratory intensive care unit on femoro-femoral mobile VV-ECMO. Three days from admission, results showed positive Leptospira IgM and real-time PCR. Serial bronchoscopies showed old and fresh clots, but not the classical progressive late red tinge of the returned lavage fluid. After eight days, VV-ECMO was weaned, he was extubated three days later, and made a full recovery. At 9 months follow-up, he was clinically better, with resolution of the CT scan findings and near normal lung function, albeit with low normal gas transfer. Conclusions: Leptospirosis is a rare but important differential to be considered in diffuse alveolar haemorrhage presenting to the ICU, especially in young males. A thorough history for occupational or recreational risk factors may offer the diagnostic clue. Most patients recover fully with antibiotics. However, resulting acute severe respiratory failure can ensue. In this situation, early consideration for respiratory ECMO support offers time for clearance of endobronchial clot, parenchymal recovery, and prevention of ventilator-induced lung injury. Steroids have no clear evidence but may be used to avoid delay in treating suspected vasculitic or autoimmune causes of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage.",

He received early renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury (AKI). A high-resolution CT scan of the chest after intubation demonstrated pneumomediastinum, pneumoperitoneum and extensive dependent consolidation.

Haemodiafiltration with regional citrate-based anticoagulation was required until day seven of the admission. Methylprednisolone was continued at a maintenance dose of 60 mg bd for 4 days until the full vasculitic screen had come back negative, with fluconazole added prophylactically in view of the steroid burden. Ceftazidime and gentamicin were started empirically for rising inflammatory markers and fever on day 6 of ECMO and continued for 7 days. The patient received 8 days of ECMO support.

It can have a mortality exceeding 50% in the intensive care setting and is traditionally associated with haemoptysis, although this may be absent in a significant proportion of patients [5] . Radiological features include a non-specific diffuse infiltrative opacification pattern on chest X-ray and ground-glass opacities on CT in acute bleeding [6] . It carries a wide differential diagnosis including vasculitis, infection, drugs, acute respiratory distress syndrome and heart failure [3] . In leptospirosis, pulmonary haemorrhage has been the presenting sign preceding other clinical features [7] . In patients admitted to the ICU with undifferentiated pulmonary haemorrhage, leptospirosis should be considered even in the absence of other typical features. DAH does not always present with classical BAL findings, as was the case here. There was evidence of clotted appearances interspersed with fresh blood. This was probably related to the delay between initial presentation with haemoptysis and the BAL, which was only performed after the initiation of ECMO. By this time, some interalveolar and endobronchial clotting would have commenced. It remains speculative as to whether the classical BAL findings would have been found if BAL was performed at the referring centre at presentation or soon after intubation. However, we did not find an alternative source, and no alternative microbiology became apparent from the ECMO BAL samples.",

Portals of entry include skin abrasions, mucous membranes or conjunctivae; it is unclear whether the bacteria can penetrate intact skin. Diagnosis is usually made using serology tests including IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). However, rapid diagnostics by blood PCR are also available [8] . Leptospira can be cultured but it requires special media. Growth is observed beyond a week and may take up to 3 months meaning routine blood cultures will be negative [9] . Clinically, leptospirosis is a biphasic illness with an acute febrile leptospiraemic phase lasting about a week, followed by an immune leptospiruric phase characterised by antibody production during which most of the complications occur. The average incubation period for leptospirosis is 10 days. Most cases involve a mild, flulike, self-limiting illness or may be subclinical. However, there are many clinical manifestations. Fever, myalgia and headache are almost universal. In addition, conjunctival suffusion, non-productive cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are commonly seen in over one third of patients [9] . The mortality for anicteric leptospirosis is very low. Neurological complications may be seen, the most common of which is aseptic meningitis with a lymphocytic predominance. Laboratory studies are non-specific. White cells are typically normal, and thrombocytopenia may occur.",

Common characteristics include male gender and young age (average 39 years, 20 to 72 years). The duration of ECMO was 2-18 days in survivors, typically 1 week. All patients received at least a penicillin or cephalosporin. Almost all patients had a convincing transmission source, either occupational or recreational, which highlights the importance of a thorough collateral history in suspected cases of leptospirosis. Including this case, mortality was 1/11 (9.1%) amongst ECMO patients at discharge, which is much lower than the reported mortality of over 50% in acute respiratory failure in an ICU context without ECMO [2, 12] .",

A thorough history for occupational or recreational risk factors is crucial and if in doubt leptospirosis serology and PCR should be sent. Most patients make a full recovery with treatment, but barotrauma does seem to be associated with DAH in leptospirosis and ECMO support should be considered early to avoid harm from non-protective ventilation. There is no clear evidence for steroids in confirmed leptospirosis and their use cannot be recommended. However, they are often instituted empirically prior to diagnosis in case of vasculitic causes for pulmonary haemorrhage. Unfortunately, leptospirosis continues to cause the greatest mortality and morbidity in low-and middle-income countries where access to ECMO is severely limited. In the future, the encouraging outcomes of patients managed with ECMO should be considered when arguing for the introduction of ECMO programmes in high-burden countries. ",
