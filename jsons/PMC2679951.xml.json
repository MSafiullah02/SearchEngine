            "text": "Memory CD8+ T cells localized in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues are important components of adaptive immunity, protecting against recurrent infection (Lefrancois and Masopust, 2002). IL-15 and IL-7 are important homeostatic cytokines for memory CD8+ T cells in secondary lymphoid tissues (Surh et al., 2006). IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice have a profound defect in memory-type CD44Hi CD122Hi (IL-2/15 R \u03b2 chain) CD8+ T cells (Kennedy et al., 2000, Surh et al., 2006) and progressively loose memory CD8+ T cells following acute infection (Becker et al., 2002). Nonetheless, a subset of IL-15-independent memory CD8+ T cells survives following viral infections (Becker et al., 2002, Obar et al., 2004, Schluns et al., 2002, Zuo et al., 2005), potentially supported by IL-7 (Carrio et al., 2007, Surh et al., 2006). During viral persistence chronic or sporadic antigen (Ag) exposure may also contribute to maintenance of Ag experienced CD8+ T cells (Obar et al., 2004). The regulation of CD8+ T cell survival and function in non-lymphoid tissues, especially during chronic viral infections is poorly understood (Bergmann et al., 1999, Ely et al., 2006, Hawke et al., 1998, Khanna et al., 2003, Masopust et al., 2006, Zhou et al., 2004). In numerous models of virus-induced encephalitis CD8+ T cells are prominent anti viral mediators, which are retained in the CNS for prolonged periods, even in the absence of detectable infectious virus (Griffin, 2003, Hawke et al., 1998, Ramakrishna et al., 2004, van der Most et al., 2003). Nevertheless, little is known about the maintenance of virus-specific CD8+ T cells in the CNS, where the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and limited MHC molecule expression on resident cells (Galea et al., 2007, Griffin, 2003) pose additional constraints on T cell homeostasis.",

            "text": "This report investigates the role of IL-15 in maintaining virus-specific CD8+ T cells in the CNS during chronic infection by the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV). JHMV CNS infection is controlled within two weeks (Bergmann et al., 1999, Bergmann et al., 2006, Ramakrishna et al., 2004), yet viral RNA persists at very low levels (Marten et al., 2000). Despite a 50% reduction in the absolute numbers of virus-specific CD8+ T cells in the CNS of IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to wt mice during acute infection, the fraction of virus-specific cells was similar and immune control of infectious virus was not affected (Zuo et al., 2006). The present study demonstrates that IL-15 deficiency did not alter levels or effector functions of virus-specific CD8+ T cells persisting in the chronically infected CNS. CD8+ T cells retained within the CNS of both wt and IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice expressed low levels of CD122 and CD127 throughout persistence and only a small proportion of CNS persisting CD8+ T cells were in cell cycle. These data suggest that the vast majority of virus-specific CD8+ T cells maintained in the CNS are derived from acute effector cells and survive independent of IL-15.",

            "text": "JHMV establishes a persistent CNS infection associated with low levels of persisting viral RNA, retention of T cells, and demyelination, but undetectable infectious virus (Bergmann et al., 2006, Marten et al., 2000). To determine whether IL-15 contributes to maintenance of CD8+ T cells within the CNS, JHMV infected wt and IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice were examined between 1 and 30 weeks p.i. Total numbers of virus-specific Db/S510 tetramer staining CD8+ cells isolated from brains of IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice at one week p.i. were on average \u223c 40% of those in wt mice (Fig. 1A). The lower absolute numbers of CNS recruited CD8+ T cells reflect reduced na\u00efve CD8+ T cells in secondary lymphoid tissue of na\u00efve IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice (Zuo et al., 2005). Nevertheless, the proportion of virus-specific cells within the CD8+ T cell population was 37\u201350% in both groups, consistent with previous data (Zuo et al., 2006). Despite initially reduced total numbers of virus-specific CD8+ T cells within the CNS, IL-15 deficiency did not accelerate their relative rate of contraction (Fig. 1A). Virus-specific CD8+ T cells declined in both groups during persistence, with numbers in the CNS of IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice remaining at \u223c 40% of wt levels out to 12 weeks p.i. (10 weeks: 7200 vs 21,100; 12 weeks: 9700 vs 18,300, respectively). Numbers of virus-specific CD8+ T continued to slowly decline up to 30 weeks p.i., at which time cells from IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice approximated 70% of the wt numbers (Fig. 1A). In both groups the highest percentages of virus-specific specific CD8+ T cells, constituting > 50% of CD8+ T cells, were detected in spinal cords (Fig. 1B), the primary site of viral RNA persistence (Marten et al., 2000). Similar to brains, the absolute numbers of virus-specific CD8+ T cells in IL-15\u2212/\u2212 spinal cords were lower, comprising within 30\u201350% the numbers recovered from wt mice. By contrast, virus-specific CD8+ T cells in the spleen and CLN were < 1% in both groups and no statistically significant differences were evident in spleens (Fig. 1B). Similar kinetics of infectious virus clearance in both mouse groups (Zuo et al., 2006) suggested that differential viral loads did not affect CD8+ T cell maintenance. Similar attrition of virus-specific CD8+ T cells within the CNS of both groups suggested that their maintenance was independent of IL-15 as a survival factor.",

            "text": "Homeostatic proliferation and survival of memory CD8+ T cells in lymphoid tissue are supported by IL-7 in addition to IL-15 (Surh et al., 2006). Persistent infections are associated with a sustained loss of CD127 expression on CD8+ T cells (Lang et al., 2005, Paiardini et al., 2005) and an apparent reduced ability to generate memory CD8+ T cells. Minimal levels of CD122 and CD127 are expressed by CD8+ T cells entering the CNS during acute JHMV infection, despite prominent expression of CD122 in lymphoid tissue (Zuo et al., 2006). To test whether either receptor chain, particularly CD127, is re-expressed after CNS viral Ag diminishes, CD122 and CD127 expression was examined during chronic JHMV infection. In both wt and IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice < 5% of virus-specific memory CD8+ T cells within the CNS expressed CD122, consistent with IL-15 independent maintenance (Fig. 2A). Splenocytes from wt mice contained a larger frequency of CD122+ tetramer\u2212 CD8+ T cells compared to IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 2A), consistent with IL-15 dependent CD8+ memory T cells in this compartment (Surh et al., 2006). However, the percentage of cells expressing CD122 in the tetramer+ splenic CD8+ T cells was similar at \u223c 25\u201330% (Fig. 2A and B). CNS derived virus-specific CD8+ T cells also remained predominantly CD127\u2212/Lo (Fig. 2A), suggesting that IL-7 mediated signaling only partially compensates for IL-15 in maintaining CD8+ T cells within the CNS. In stark contrast to the CNS, \u223c 85% of virus-specific CD8+ T cells in the spleen expressed CD127 in both wt and IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 2A and B), supporting differential maintenance mechanisms in these tissues. Although CD127 expression increased somewhat on the total CNS persisting CD8+ T cell population compared to cells present during acute inflammation (Fig. 2C), expression levels did not reach those of splenic memory CD8+ T cells (Fig. 2C). Low CD122 and CD127 expression on CNS derived CD8+ T cells suggests that they maintain an effector phenotype. Analysis of IL-15 and IL-7 mRNA in the CNS of wt mice demonstrated low expression compared to spleens (Fig. 2D). Detection of basal IL-15 mRNA in the CNS of na\u00efve mice is consistent with IL-15 expression in cerebellum and hippocampus (Gomez-Nicola et al., 2008). However, no significant increases of these cytokines in the CNS were observed during infection, supporting a minor role in driving CD8+ T cell turnover within the CNS.",

Cells in the spleen exhibited more heterogeneous CD62L expression, consistent with memory T cells established following control of peripheral infections (Wherry et al., 2003b).

Similar frequencies were detected within the tetramer+ and tetramer\u2212 CD8+ T cell populations (data not shown), negating selective turnover of virus-specific compared to CD8+ T cells of unknown specificity. Although proliferation rates were increased almost 2-fold in the CNS of IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice, there was also no evidence for preferential proliferation of tetramer+ CD8+ T cells. Analysis of corresponding memory phenotype CD44Hi CD8+ T cells in the spleen demonstrated \u223c 14% Ki-67+ cells in wt mice and \u223c 23% in IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 4B).

IL-15 independent survival was supported by a persisting CD122\u2212/Lo phenotype in the vast majority of CNS persisting CD8+ T cells, as well as their IL-15 independent attrition. Similar percentages of virus-specific CD8+ T cells in lymphoid tissue of wt and IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice during chronic infection was further consistent with their moderate CD122 expression in the spleen. This contrasted with high CD122 expression during the expansion phase (Zuo et al., 2006). Furthermore, while splenic JHMV specific CD8+ T cells expressed CD127 during persistence, CNS persisting CD8+ T cells expressed only low levels of CD127 in both wt and IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice. The persistence of JHMV specific CD8+ T cells in the CNS contrasts the gradual loss of memory CD8+ T cells from the respiratory tract attributed to IL-7R and IL-15R downregulation following influenza virus infection (Shen et al., 2008). Low level proliferation confirmed that IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 do not play a major role in sustaining CD8+ T cells within the CNS. Nevertheless, IL-7 likely contributes to sustain CD127+ virus-specific T cells in lymphoid tissue in both wt and IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice, supporting a nonredundant role of IL-7 in homeostasis (Carrio et al., 2007). A possible stimulus contributing to CD8+ T cell maintenance during persistent infection is persisting Ag (Obar et al., 2004, Wherry et al., 2003a). However, JHMV Ag is undetectable and viral RNA barely detectable in brains and spinal cords of wt mice by 6 weeks p.i. (Marten et al., 2000) providing little evidence for direct Ag mediated stimulation.",

However, they gradually down regulated CD44 expression, an adhesion molecule whose ligands include extracellular matrix proteoglycan and hyaluronate (Lesley et al., 1993). Virtually all inflammatory cells express high levels of CD44 during acute JHMV infection (Bergmann et al., 1999) consistent with CD44 mediated lymphocyte extravasation and entry into the CNS (Brennan et al., 1999). Down regulation of CD44 expression and gradual IL-15 independent Bcl-2 accumulation in CNS CD8+ T cells implies local differentiation into long-lived memory CD8+ T cells (Grayson et al., 2000). Consistent with a resting state, CD8+ T cells expressing granzyme B were sparse throughout persistence. Prolonged CD69 expression by CNS T cells may thus reflect a retention rather than recent activation signal (Shiow et al., 2006). Indeed, there is no evidence for direct antiviral functions of CD8+ T cells persisting in the CNS of JHMV persistently infected mice as demonstrated by the necessity for humoral immunity to control recrudescence, even in mice with established T cell memory (Ramakrishna et al., 2003, Ramakrishna et al., 2006). Furthermore, effector CD8+ T cells persisting in the CNS, even when virus is cleared, are not necessarily associated with pathology (Hawke et al., 1998).",

A major contribution of ongoing CD8+ T cell recruitment into the CNS during JHMV persistence is unlikely due to limited BBB penetration by resting memory cells compared to other organs (Masopust et al., 2004). A decreased population of proliferating cells in CNS resident compared to splenic memory CD8+ T cells, independent of Ag specificity, further supports minimal continual CNS recruitment. Finally, inhibition of chemokine signaling does not alter CD8+ T cell frequencies during JHMV persistence (Stiles et al., 2006). These data favor the notion that CNS CD8+ T cell populations are sustained as a result of low turnover.",

This dichotomy is most evident in the association between enrichment and persistence of virus specific CD8+ T cells with elevated IL-15 levels in the CNS of simian immunodeficiency virus infected monkeys (Marcondes et al., 2007). Differences may reside in virus tropism, type I IFN mediated upregulation of IL-15, as well as persistent virus load. Our results support basal expression of IL-15 in the CNS (Gomez-Nicola et al., 2008), yet levels are significantly reduced relative to lymphoid tissue. The absence of significantly enhanced IL-15 expression during infection is consistent with low levels of type I IFN induction by coronaviruses (Ireland et al., 2008, Roth-Cross et al., 2008). Although we cannot rule out that loss of in vivo CD8+ T cell function during persistence may be attributed to the sparse IL-15 environment, IFN-\u03b3 secretion was effectively initiated after short term stimulation in vitro without supplementing IL-15. The recent findings that IL-15 enhances activation of astrocytes and microglia (Gomez-Nicola et al., 2008), furthermore caution that IL-15 supplementation in vivo to enhance CD8 T cell immunity in the CNS may contribute to gliosis and pathology.",
