Given a growing appreciation in the literature for both heterogeneity of presentation and disease severity, it is critical to have a clear sense of COVID-19 testing performance (2) . It is unclear why our patient's first two nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were negative. Possible explanations include improper collection or handling technique, viral load below the detectable limit of the assay, or diminished upper airway viral shedding. The latter possibly reflects the natural history of the disease wherein duration of viral shedding (which may precede symptom onset by several days) was observed to be as few as eight days to as many as 37 (1); additionally, it is conceivable that the patient's immunocompromised state may have contributed.",

Based on these observations, the authors theorized a de-isolation protocol that not only considers date from symptom onset as is suggested by CDC (7), but also viral load. In a similar study, To and colleagues sought to ascertain viral load dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the posterior oropharynx and tracheal aspirates, as well as antibody kinetics and the viral genome, by collecting serial swabs from 23 patients (8) . They found that viral loads correlated positively with age and peaked shortly after symptom onset and subsequently declined. Of note, they found that in one third of the cohort viral RNA could still be detected from the posterior oropharynx after 20 days. This observation questions the feasibility of incorporating viral load into deisolation protocols, as it remains unknown whether these patients are continuing to shed live virus versus inactive virions coated in neutralizing antibody.",

The majority of patients presented with fever, cough, and fatigue, while 39 (19%) had severe disease. The authors reported positive rates highest for BAL specimens (93%), followed by sputum (72%), nasal swabs (63%), brush biopsy (46%), pharyngeal swabs (32%), feces (29%) and blood (1%), with no positives detected from urine. Furthermore, a number of studies have attempted to define the natural history of viral shedding in COVID-19 disease. In an analysis of nine patients with mild COVID-19, W\u00f6lfel and colleagues found that pharyngeal shedding predominated and reached a peak in the first week of symptomatic disease, with upper airway viral load already declining at the time of presentation (6). This observation is consistent with our patient's negative NP RT-PCR results from illness on days seven and ten. Shedding in sputum, however, continued through the first week of disease and extended as far as 3 weeks after symptoms began in patients with evidence of lung J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",
