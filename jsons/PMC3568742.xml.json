            "text": "Because therapeutic options are limited and the majority of intervention strategies are focused on supportive treatment, emphasis has been placed on identifying patients who are at higher risk for ALI [4,5]. Patients with ALI represent a heterogeneous group of patients with regard to predisposing conditions [6] that differ in pathophysiologic changes [7,8], clinical and radiologic [9] characteristics, as well as treatment options [10,11], but the data on specific risk factors in subsets of patients according to predisposing causes are limited. Although sepsis, particularly pulmonary in origin, is the most common underlying risk factor for ALI, in only a small proportion of hospitalized patients with pneumonia does the complication develop (< 10%) [4]. Defining risk factors associated with the development of ALI in patients with infectious pneumonia is challenging because virulence factors of different pathogens have been implicated in causing lung damage [12,13]. In patients with pneumonia, the relation between ALI and specific pathogens has been described mainly in case series and case reports of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with Legionella and certain types of viral and fungal pneumonia, suggesting that some pathogens are particularly prone to induce lung injury. A recent study of critically ill patients demonstrated that pulmonary infection is associated with a higher risk of developing ARDS, as compared with infections at nonpulmonary sites [14]. Systematic data regarding occurrence, risk factors, and outcome of ALI/ARDS in patients with infectious pneumonia are lacking.",

The details of the ALI electronic alert have been previously published [16]. All patients with a positive ALI \"sniffer\" were reassessed and ALI diagnosed by an independent review of portable chest radiographs, arterial blood gases, and hemodynamic parameters based on American/European consensus conference definition [19]. For adequate interpretation of radiologic studies in the diagnosis of ALI, the abstractors reviewed a structured ALI tutorial before study onset. Interrater reliability for diagnosing ALI was assessed in previous studies (kappa value of 0.8) [20]. The timing of ARDS was determined by the first recorded time of either criterion when both criteria (PaO2/FIO2, bilateral infiltrates) were met.",

If an appropriate control was not found for a specific pathogen, matching was for the same genus, family, and finally pathogen group (G-, G+, atypical bacteria, viruses, and fungi). Patients with coinfections were matched to appropriate controls in the same fashion (all pathogens were matched). Because preliminary data suggested increased risk of ALI among Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, these cases were matched to specific pathogen, regardless of coinfection. The matching was conservative to provide as perfect as possible matches. Among 171 cases of ALI, 118 were diagnosed with ALI more than 6 hours after pneumonia onset, of whom 112 were matched according these criteria. We extracted data from the preexisting hospital electronic database, which included integrated microbiologic and susceptibility results, vital signs as well as laboratory parameters, comorbidities, and use of medications. Risk factors were compared between patients who developed ALI and matched controls. For quality assurance, we performed random checks of electronic database entries. Standard definitions were used for shock [21], inappropriate antimicrobial treatment [22], and transfusions [23]. We used the Pneumonia severity index (PSI) [24] to assess baseline severity of illness and the Charlson score [25] as a measure of comorbidities. Arterial oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (SpO2) was recorded if there was a delay in obtaining arterial blood gas analysis, and the SpO2/FIO2 ratio was used to substitute PaO2/FIO2 ratio (SpO2/FIO2 < 315 corresponds to PaO2/FIO2 < 300) [26]. To assure similar exposure time to possible risk factors between cases and controls, the exposure time for each control was matched to the exposure time of the corresponding case. That means that data on possible intrahospital exposures of cases were collected from onset of pneumonia to onset of ALI, whereas in controls, data were tabulated for the same number of hours subsequent to the onset of pneumonia.",

[28]. Among the most common pathogens, no difference in the rates of ALI was found. We observed a higher proportion of ALI occurrence in patients with less common infections due to fungal and viral respiratory pathogens. The higher rate of ALI among these pathogen groups likely relates to P. jiroveci, and specific endemic fungi, including Blastomyces species and viral infections (RSV, cytomegalovirus). Possible explanations for this higher risk include delayed antimicrobial treatment, as these pathogens are often not treated with initial empiric antimicrobial coverage, as well as baseline characteristics of the patients, because these infections more commonly occur in those who are immunocompromised. Progression to ALI is likely a result of a complex interaction of patient immune status and specific pathogen [29]. Conversely, when adjusted for a specific pathogen, immunosupression did not influence progression to ALI. However, these results must be interpreted with caution because matching by specific pathogen is similar to matching by immune status or other baseline risk factors for these pathogens, which precludes analyzing the significance of these risk factors for developing ALI. Unfortunately, our study design does not allow further assessment of independent effects of a pathogen on risk for ALI development. Although numerous reports exist of Legionella pneumonia-induced ARDS, our study failed to confirm an increased risk of ALI in these patients. It is possible that early initiation of empiric antimicrobial coverage for atypical bacteria, as proposed in current pneumonia guidelines, has reduced this devastating complication in patients with Legionella pneumonia. We observed no case of ALI in the course of pneumonia caused by other \"atypical\" bacteria.",

The evolution of ALI could be influenced by both baseline characteristics of the patients (first hit) as well as a variety of intrahospital exposures (second hit) [31]. Certain prehospital exposures (alcohol, smoking) [32,33], medical errors (delayed shock resuscitation, delayed antibiotic treatment) [30], and iatrogenic exposures (plasma transfusion from alloimmunized donors, gastric aspiration, certain chemotherapeutic drugs) [23,34,35] have all been associated with development of ALI in hospitalized patients. Similar to the results of other studies [35], we observed higher baseline severity of illness among ALI cases. Considering baseline characteristics, patients with ALI were more often smokers, although statistical difference was not reached. This could be because we used patients' histories to obtain information on smoking. In a recent study by Hsieh [36], serum and urine nicotine metabolites identified considerably more active smokers than did smoking history. Active and passive cigarette smoking was found to be associated with ALI after severe blunt trauma, when a biomarker of tobacco smoking was used to assess smoking history [37]. Unlike several other studies [32,38], the history of alcohol abuse did not influence the risk of ALI. In addition, although the majority of studies implicated diabetes to have a protective role [39,40], no difference in number of diabetics was found between the cases and controls in our study.",

When matched for age, gender, and pathogen characteristics, and adjusted for baseline severity of illness, the major interventions that were associated with an increased risk of ALI were transfusions and inappropriate initial antimicrobial therapy. Previous studies demonstrated an increased risk of ALI in patients with delayed treatment of infection [30]. The time of antibiotic initiation did not influence ALI development in our study, as most patients received antibiotics in the emergency department or immediately after admission; however, ALI was associated with inappropriate initial antimicrobial therapy. In patients with pneumonia, inappropriate initial antibiotic treatment noticeably increases the risk of hospital death [41,42]. The failure to provide adequate antibiotic treatments is more likely in HCAP and HAP, as Gram-negative bacteria and S. aureus are major pathogens in these patients [28]. In addition to antimicrobial resistance [41], it seems that patients with HCAP are often not empirically treated for these organisms, resulting in suboptimal antibiotic therapy and increased mortality [43]. Although shock was clearly associated with ALI development, the association of delayed goal-directed resuscitation could not be examined because of a relatively low number of shock patients among controls. The observed association between transfusion and lung injury has been demonstrated in number of studies [40,44,45]. The observed association between the use of statins and the decreased risk of ALI is consistent with the recent report by O'Neal et al. [46]. Contrary to a previous report in a population-based cohort of nonselected patients at risk of ALI [47], the use of antiplatelet agents in patients with infectious pneumonia was not associated with decreased risk of ALI.",

Because the majority of patients with pneumonia do not undergo any microbial testing, some patients with pneumonia were excluded and may have biased our study population to more severe cases that underwent such evaluation. Diagnosis of atypical pneumonia is difficult because of the fastidious nature of atypical organisms; the sensitivity of cultures is low, serologic assays are poorly standardized [52], and PCR is not generally available [27]. Because only semiquantitative analysis of lower respiratory secretions were available, differentiation between microbiologically definite and probable pneumonia was not possible in all patients. Conversely, because ALI/ARDS also has noninfectious etiologies (aspiration, organizing pneumonia, transfusion-induced lung injury (TRALI), acute eosinophilic pneumonia, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and other interstitial lung diseases), we believe that isolation of a microbiologic agent strengthened the diagnosis of infectious pneumonia and prevented the inclusion of noninfectious lung diseases that might have been included by using only the clinical definition.",
