Prone positioning was first suggested in 1974 [13]; however, the clinical benefit of prone positioning in patients with ARDS was not confirmed until 2013 when the PROSEVA study showed decreased 28-day and 90-day mortality and increased ventilator-free days only when it was started early and there were sufficiently long sessions [12]. Further, meta-analysis by Cochrane database also revealed that prone positioning would reduce the mortality rate when used with lung-protective strategies and longer duration in patients with severe ARDS [14, 15].",

Even though peak airway pressure, dynamic driving pressure, and compliance are mathematically coupled, we planned to formally test the collinearity within them and, if verified, to use a specific Cox model for each. We also included those collinear variables two-by-two into three additional Cox regression models [23], besides the other covariates. One model pertained to peak airway pressure and dynamic driving pressure, one to peak airway pressure and compliance, and one to dynamic driving pressure and compliance. If both variables in the couple lacked significance, the conclusion could be that the same information was carried by each component of the couple. If one of the variables in the couple remained significantly correlated with survival, this variable would be more informative than the other in the couple. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR). In this study, we used the two-tailed test, and the definition of significance was p value < 0.05.",

The present study was more homogenous and specific to patients with ARDS caused by influenza pneumonia. Systematic review and meta-analysis studies in prone positioning have revealed decreased mortality in patients with severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, but not in less severe hypoxemia. Survival benefits were noted using a range of PaO2/FiO2 ratio thresholds up to approximately 140 mm Hg [25] or less than 200 mm Hg [26]. In the present study, the PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 95.9 \u00b1 54.5 mm Hg before prone positioning.

In terms of the response of prone positioning to ARDS, the different entities of the risk factor possibly produce different outcomes. In addition to severity of hypoxemia, further clinical trials would assist in clarifying the survival benefits of prone positioning in the specific risk factors.",

A secondary analysis of data from 787 ARDS patients enrolled in two independent randomized controlled trials revealed that when ventilating patients with low tidal volume, driving pressure was a risk factor for death in ARDS patients, as was plateau pressure or compliance of respiratory system [33]. Airway driving pressure was significantly related to lung stress and could detect lung over-stress with acceptable accuracy (r2 = 0.581 p < 0.0001 and r2 = 0.353 p < 0.0001 at 5 and 15 cm H2O of PEEP) in ARDS patients [23]. Furthermore, the APRONET study on prone positioning of ARDS patients found that prone positioning was associated with low complication rates, significant increase in oxygenation, and a significant decrease in driving pressure [14 (11\u201317 cm H2O) to 13 [10\u201316] cm H2O, p = 0.04] [34]. Our previous study for severe ARDS patients with ECMO revealed that higher dynamic driving pressure [hazard ratio 1.070 (1.026\u20131.116), p = 0.002] during the first 3 days of ECMO was one of the factors independently associated with ICU mortality [35]. The present study in influenza pneumonia-related ARDS patients receiving prone positioning also found that increased dynamic driving pressure (hazard ratio 1.372, 95% confidence interval 1.095\u20131.718; p = 0.006) was identified as one of the independent predictors associated with 60-day mortality. It was suggested that ventilatory support with lung-protective strategy with low tidal volume and optimal PEEP level be applied, and these be then adjusted according to the driving pressure, ideally less than 15 cm H2O, although this limit should be addressed in future studies [36]. Despite some studies associating driving pressure with physiological and clinical outcomes, it is necessary to evaluate the driving pressure as a primary end point during ventilatory setting in ARDS patients in the near future.",

A prospective international prevalence study (the APRONET study, ARDS Prone Position Network) found that the rates of prone positioning were up to 5.9%, 10.3% and 32.9% in mild, moderate and severe ARDS [30]. In our study, the rates of prone positioning were 18%, 15% and 31% in mild, moderate and severe ARDS, respectively. The substantially different rates in the use of the prone positioning may reflect the management bias of prone positioning in patients with ARDS between the different studies. Furthermore, among our eight involved hospitals, the rate of prone positioning varied from 0% (0/37) to 67% (2/3) and the bias even existed between different hospitals in the same study. It is important to be homogenous on the indication and management in the selected prone position as one of the standard interventions in severe ARDS.",

Secondly, the primary end point of this study was 60-day mortality, and the value of computed power was 0.585. This was a retrospective study, and 65 patients with severe ARDS receiving prone positioning were analyzed. Although more patients were needed to increase the power of this study, the limitation was from the nature of retrospective study within a 3-month period. Thirdly, prone positioning is not a routine intervention in the management of ARDS and has no standard procedure such as how many hours a day, how to perform it or how to protect the patients. In this study, even though every patient had prone positioning for more than 16 h a day, the exact duration showed little difference between each hospital. Fourthly, the change in physiological measurements pertains to a difference between supine and prone position, and hence, the impact of chest wall is not taken into account. Finally, in this study, we focused on influenza-related ARDS patients, and whether the result can be extrapolated to all patients with ARDS is unknown, requiring further investigation. To confirm the benefit of prone positioning in ARDS especially in influenza pneumonia, further prospective randomized control studies are needed with strict standard procedures and patient selection.",
