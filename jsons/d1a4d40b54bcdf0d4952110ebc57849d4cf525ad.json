The Tropical Medicine Research Centers (TMRC) is a program that is intended to support 4 foreign institutions-currently located in Mali, China, Colombia, and Brazil-in conducting research of direct relevance to the health of the people in tropical environments and to promote collaborations and exchange of information between foreign and U.S. scientists (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/ rfa-files/RFA-AI-06-006.html). This program was initiated in 1991 to support International Centers located in disease endemic areas in conducting research in major tropical diseases. The 2006 initiative solicited applications in the areas of leishmaniasis, Chagas' disease, and human African trypanosomiasis to facilitate translational research using the recently published genomes of the trypanosomatids. r International Cooperative Biodiversity Groups Program (ICBG). The International Cooperative Biodiversity Groups is a program with a threefold mission: conservation of biodiversity, economic growth for develop-ing countries (e.g., Central and South America, Nigeria, Cameroon, Madagascar, Jordan, Central Asia, Papua New Guinea, Laos, and Vietnam), and discovery of pharmaceuticals from natural products. NIAID, together with the National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), FIC, the National Science Foundation, and the USDA, are the co-sponsors of ICBG. The current awards are given to multidisciplinary research groups that also include in-country, research-capacity collections, and partnerships with a pharmaceutical company. The ICBG program has been widely recognized as a model for research partnerships that acknowledge intellectual property ownership of indigenous communities. Framework Agreement between the U.S. government and the government of the Republic of South Africa concerning cooperation in scientific, technologic, and environmental fields, including areas of public health, was signed on December 5, 1995. This agreement is still in effect.",

Partners include hospitals and institutions in Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The network is committed to building independent research capacity within the SEA countries involved. NIAID and the Wellcome Trust provide financial support.

Among them are the program at Tufts University on cryptococcus; four core activities to support HIV/AIDS research; work on the interactions of HIV/AIDS and TB and of HIV/AIDS and malaria; and malaria drug studies. Despite expending 7.6% of the gross domestic product (GDP) on health in 2004, Uganda has a high infant mortality rate and low life expectancy (WHO). HIV prevalence declined from 15% in 1991 to 5% by 2001, but this decline has stopped. The government has announced a countrywide plan to implement male circumcision as an HIV/AIDS preventive method. As in neighboring countries, tuberculosis incidence is high (WHO), and cases of MDR TB have been found. Outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis have occurred in 2006 and 2007, cholera in 2003, and Ebola in 2000. In addition, bacterial diarrhea, hepatitis A, typhoid fever, vector-borne diseases-malaria and African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness)-and watercontact schistosomiasis are high risks in some locations.

In addition, wellcharacterized clinical samples will be available for distribution to TBRU investigators and their collaborators through a newly established repository. The activities of the TBRU are coordinated with other major organizations involved in tuberculosis research, including CDC, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), WHO, Global Alliance for TB Drug Development, and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD), and with interested industrial partners. Vaccine Action Program (VAP). The Indo-U.S. Vaccine Action Program (VAP) was initiated in 1987 as a bilateral program that focuses on the development of safe and effective vaccines for major communicable diseases of interest to India and the United States through joint research and development. Currently, the focus of VAC is on HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. r U.S.-Japan Cooperative Medical Science Program. This is a 36-year-old bilateral, cooperative research program involving U.S. and Japanese scientists who convene on a regular basis to address public health priorities in Asia; for example, the U.S.-Japan Workshops in Medical Mycology (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/fungal#2e). The goals of these workshops have been to initiate interactions; build collaborations; identify research needs; turn needs into opportunities; stimulate molecular research in medical mycology; and summarize recommendations emerging from workshop proceedings (1). International Training and Research in Emerging Infectious Diseases (ITREID). The International Training and Research in Emerging Infectious Diseases (ITREID) has been established as collaboration between NIAID and the Fogarty International Center (FIC) to support international training and research. The intent of this program is to enable NIH grant recipients to enhance laboratory, epidemiologic, clinical, and social sciences research and to train scientists and public health workers from developing countries and their U.S. counterparts in research, control, and prevention strategies. International Malaria Research Training Program(IMRTP). The IMRTP initiative is a joint collaborative program of the Fogarty International Center and NIAID aimed at training and/or expanding the capabilities of scientists and health professionals from developing countries in which malaria is endemic and to engage in research relevant to severe malarial anemia (http://grants. nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-TW-01-006.html).",

Five comprehensive awards and seven planning grants were announced (http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/dec2003/fic-16.htm). Areas of research include discovery of natural products for treatment of HIV, TB, malaria, and other tropical diseases, with screening of extracts from Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Papua New Guinea, Laos, Vietnam, Panama, Jordan, and Costa Rica. Two additional comprehensive awards co-funded by NIAID were awarded in 2006 (http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/jan2006/fic-03.htm) from the planning grants. r 2006 NIAID Research Conference. As part of its mission to reduce the burden of human disease, NIH-and NIAID in particular-has committed to encouraging the accelerated translation of biomedical discoveries into new treatments outside the United States. One direction for NIAID has been to broaden research opportunities and collaborations with scientists and research and educational institutions in Europe and in particular of countries from Central and Eastern Europe, the Baltics, Russia, Ukraine, and other newly independent states of the former Soviet Union. To this end, the Office of Global Research at NIAID took the initiative to organize the 2006 NIAID Research Conference in Opatija, Croatia (June 26-30, 2006) (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/program/croatia).The Scientific Program of the Conference covered a wide range of sessions by invited speakers on topics reflecting the broad scope of scientific activities",
