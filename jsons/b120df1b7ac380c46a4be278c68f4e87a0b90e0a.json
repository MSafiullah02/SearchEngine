The loss of cash is limited to the amount in the wallet, but unlike a credit or debit card issuer, the Federal Reserve (or, more generally, a central bank) or the Treasury cannot protect the carrier of cash against such \"fraudulent use\" (that is, theft); nor is the carrier protected against pathogens such as the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, possibly lurking on the banknote surfaces.

Second, we have central banks and governments, which in many instances perceive digital currency as a threat to the existing monetary system (including through its cannibalization). However, there is a flipside to this too: the issuergovernments stand to gain, not lose, control as -unlike with paper money -with digital money all transactions are recorded and the information is readily available to the authorities; albeit this information should only be used to prevent nefarious activities. 15 In this regard, the U.S. is the sovereign state with most to lose in the process of the inevitably forthcoming avalanche of government-issued digital currencies, with a clear policy implication: adapt to the changing reality, issue the digital dollar sooner rather than later, or risk being marginalized [Kakushadze and Liew, 2018 ] -including by China (see, e.g., [Horsley, 2020] ) and other players. 16 It is difficult to imagine mass adoption of digital currencies unless they are issued by governments (or governmental agencies) with streamlined rules and regulations. What would be truly remarkable in this regard is a supranational digital currency, which was termed iCurrency in [Kakushadze and Liew, 2015] , backed by a broad consortium of sovereign governments [Kakushadze and Liew, 2018] , [Kakushadze and Yu, 2019] . iCurrency would allow more precise estimation of global inflation, global output, global productivity, global labor gains, and other global macroeconomic indicators, as well as GDP (gross domestic product) for various countries and regions and globally. (GDP measured using iCurrency was termed iGDP in [Kakushadze and Liew, 2015] .) With low sovereign government intervention (which requires a democratic protocol for the issuing consortium of sovereign governments) and low fees for global transactions, iCurrency should be a boon to our global economy. Perhaps somewhat ironically, government-issued digital currencies may be a step forward (not backward) in this regard, depending on how the world leaders approach this issue. This brings us to our 15 In the U.S. the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (or BSA) [Meltzer, 1991] , among other things, requires financial institutions to file a Currency Transaction Report (CTR) with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) for all transactions exceeding $10,000. The U.S. Government records and stores information about all such transactions internally. This information is invaluable in light of the U.S. dollar being the dominant reserve currency [Kakushadze and Liew, 2018] . 16 The Federal Reserve has been looking into developing a digital currency in the U.S. for some time -see, e.g., [Heeb, 2019] . For the digital dollar to be competitive, reducing tax rates and not taxing non-US-derived income might be required [Kakushadze and Liew, 2018] . Quoting from [Kakushadze and Liew, 2015] : \"If mankind is destined to make it to Mars (and beyond) and establish extraterrestrial colonies in our solar system, a universal currency devoid of government control and other forms of manipulation would appear to be a necessity, rather than wishful thinking.\" So, ridding our monetary system of paper money indeed appears to be a win-win: among many other things, not only would it be good for our global economy, but it would also get rid of a ubiquitous medium for spreading germs and help save lives, so we would have one fewer worry in times of crises such as the latest coronavirus outbreak. SCRL), the leading worldwide network for cross-border payments, is a cooperative society operating under the Belgian law and is owned by its member financial institutions. However, the U.S. is still able to get its way by, e.g., levying sanctions on SWIFT if the latter does not cooperate (see, e.g., [Gladstone, 2012] ). In this regard, if there is a supranational iCurrency and SWIFT is replaced by another network for cross-border payments in iCurrency, the U.S.'s leverage will not be diminished as it can levy sanctions all the same. 18 The U.S.'s leverage does not lie in it directly controlling SWIFT (which it does not), or that the U.S. dollar is the dominant reserve currency. Instead, it stems from the U.S. being the largest and most stable economy, and most wish to avoid their U.S. assets frozen, travel restricted, or being otherwise sanctioned. 17 As mentioned above, what we are proposing here is not adopting decentralized or Libra-like cryptocurrencies as national digital currencies or a supranational iCurrency, but government-issued and appropriately regulated sovereign digital currencies and a supranational digital iCurrency issued by a broad consortium of governments. However, regulatory sentiments around the world for cryptocurrencies are still instructive; see, e.g., [GLRC, 2018] . 18 E.g., if, hypothetically, Ripple started processing payments for Iran, it would invariably draw the U.S.'s ire.",

Thus, according to [Gourinchas, Rey and Govillot, 2017] , this excess return was about 2. 6%/yr during 1952, Q1 to 1972, Q4, and 2.4%/yr from 1973, Q1 to 2016, Q1. However, this exorbitant privilege also has a flipside: the \"exorbitant duty\". 20 In a nutshell, the U.S. provides insurance to the rest of the world (ROW) in exchange for having the (exorbitant) privilege of paying low interest rates on its safe dollar-denominated assets. So, the exorbitant privilege is not a free lunch but an insurance (risk) premium. In times of global crisis, the U.S. dollar appreciates (owing to a flight to safety), which results in a massive wealth transfer from the U.S. to the ROW. 21 Superfluously this may appear innocuous as on average the exorbitant privilege translates into a positive return. However, the U.S. debt increases in the process as the valuations of the U.S. Treasuries do not collapse [Gourinchas, Rey and Govillot, 2017] .",

The status of the U.S. dollar as the dominant reserve currency also harms the competitiveness of the U.S. exports as its exchange rate is an estimated 5-10% higher than it would otherwise be [Dobbs et al, 2009 ]. Would it not make more sense to spread the burden during the global crises more evenly across the world as opposed to shouldering it alone while the ROW gets bailed out -in fact, gets paid -for (in many cases) causing such crises in the first instance? The latest coronavirus outbreak and the turmoil that it has caused the financial markets was certainly not caused by the U.S. In this regard, iCurrency would be beneficial, not harmful, to the U.S. The stability of iCurrency 24 would have to be maintained by the entire consortium, not by the U.S. alone. This latest crisis caused by the coronavirus outbreak might be the high time for the U.S. to reevaluate its view on the U.S. dollar as the dominant reserve currency, the exorbitant privilege and exorbitant duty and shift toward a less volatile and more sustainable (at least in terms of its ever-growing debt) regime where the ROW, many parts of which got extremely wealthy through wealth transfers from the U.S., will take its fair share of responsibility for the stability of our global economy. And the U.S.'s hegemony does not hinge on the U.S. dollar being the dominant reserve currency, but on its stable economy, legal system, science and technology, innovation, entrepreneurship, free speech, democracy, and many other things that make the U.S. what it is.",
