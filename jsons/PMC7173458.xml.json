Pulmonary infections are commonly reported from developing and developed countries.4., 8., 9., 10. Although there are many microbiological testing methods available for the diagnosis of such infections and there are various antimicrobial treatment therapies for the management of pulmonary infections, sometimes the curing rate of these infections is reported to be low due to certain limitations. Microbiological testing methods are believed to be slow and insensitive, whereas, the uncontrolled and over use of antibiotics create the major problem of antibiotic resistance.11., 12. Recently, the ability of common pathogens to acquire resistance to widely used antimicrobial therapies has been increased.13 The authors further suggested that the number of pathogens that exhibit resistance to one or multiple drugs (MDR) have been increasing gradually. Currently, the problem of antimicrobial resistance in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and other pathogens causing pulmonary infections has become a major threat. Karchmer14 reported that antimicrobial resistance is particularly prevalent among the most common pathogens associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections, which includes Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes.\n15 Hence, the morbidity and mortality associated with the pulmonary infection pose a growing challenge to clinical practitioners.16 Considering the huge scope and applications of nanotechnology in biomedicine, it has been proven that nanotechnology will play a crucial role for the management of problems associated with antibiotic resistance including multiple drug resistance. Therefore, these life-threatening challenges including pulmonary infections can now be overcome with the help of nanotechnology.12., 17.\n",

Other severe sign and symbols of pneumonia are vomiting, unconsciousness, convulsions.1 Bacteria are supposed to be the most common source of pneumonia. Streptococcus pneumoniae is responsible for more than 50% of the infections, Haemophilus influenza causes 20% of the infections. Mycoplasma pneumoniae also causes infection in 3% of the population and some other bacterium like Stenotrophomonas maltophilia also reported to cause pneumonia.18 Certain viruses like coronaviruses, influenza virus, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus causes pneumonia.19 Fungal pneumonia is very rare. It is mostly observed in immunocompromised patients. Common fungi which cause pneumonia are Cryptococcus neoformans, Pneumocystis jirovecii, and Coccidioides immitis.\n2., 20.\n",

When a TB patient speaks, coughs, or sneezes, TB bacteria may be spread and infect nearby individuals. Even if a person is infected with M. tuberculosis, it may be in inactive form and is only activated in patients with lower immunity or who is in a later stage of life.21 Common signs of TB are persistent cough with sputum for more than 3 weeks, chest pain, loss of appetite, chill, fever, sweating at night, fatigueness and weight loss. Most patients do not show the symptoms of TB but develop the disease at the later stage.4., 22. Not every individual become sick after this infection, they can have TB bacteria in the body but the body is able to fight against the bacteria. People with such an infection do not spread TB infection to others. This form of infection is known as Latent TB.

Mostly, aspergillosis is caused by A. flavus, A. niger and A. terreus. A. fumigatus is commonly found in patients suffering from invasive aspergillosis. There are three types of pulmonary infections: allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA).24., 25. The common symptoms of aspergillosis are fever, cough, breathlessness and chest pain. ABPA infection is mainly characterized with asthmatic patients and with eosinophilia deficient patient. Generally, invasive aspergillosis is reported in immunocompromised patients with neutropenia and after organ transplantation.26., 27.\n",

Min and Jang31 studied the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of macrolides drugs (viz. azithromycin, clarithromycin, dirithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, and telithromycin) against respiratory viral infections caused by rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus. The results showed significant antiviral activity against all the tested pulmonary viruses. Henry et al.32 proposed the bacteriophage therapy for the treatment of pulmonary infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. They found that pulmonary infections caused by antibiotic-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be safely managed by using various bacteriophages from the Myoviridae and Podoviridae family. In another similar study, Semler et al.33 demonstrated the use of phage therapy for respiratory infections caused by antibiotic-resistant Burkholderia cepacia. The effectiveness of the therapy was studied by establishing the B. cenocepacia respiratory infections in mice using a nebulizer and a nose-only inhalation device, the mice were treated with different B. cenocepacia-specific phages delivered as either an aerosol or intraperitoneal injection. The results obtained after 2 days of treatment suggested that aerosol phage therapy appears to be an effective method. Whereas, the mice that received phage treatment by intraperitoneal injection did not show significant activity.",

They demonstrated that use of aerosolized amikacin as a standard oral therapy against nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary infection significantly improved treatment efficacy without producing systemic toxicity. Therefore, it was proposed that aerosolized delivery of amikacin is a promising adjunct to standard therapy for pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial infections.

Moreover, it requires a prolonged course of therapy with a combination of drugs. However, there are numerous challenges regarding the treatment of NTM pulmonary infections, but few drugs which can manage these infections are available. Some macrolide drugs like azithromycin and clarithromycin are the efficient and important drugs in the therapy for MAC lung infections. In the case of a resistant strain, a combination therapy with rifampin or rifabutin, and ethambutol (triple therapy) with or without an intravenous aminoglycoside is recommended for about 18 months or more. Similarly, in the case of infection by M. kansasii, combination of isoniazid, rifampin and ethanbutol is mostly recommended for about 12 months. In addition, macrolides, such as, clarithromycin and the fourth generation fluoroquinolone moxifloxacin demonstrated very good in vitro activity against M. kansasii and may be an alternative to isoniazid. Whereas, lung infections due to M. abscessus are very difficult to treat successfully with drug therapy alone. Chemotherapy in conjunction with surgical resection is often recommended in those who can tolerate it. Overall, different kinds of medications and therapies are available for the management of pulmonary infections, but in case of some pulmonary infections existing treatments and therapies showed certain limitations, which are briefly discussed here.",

There are many limitations of microbiology laboratories to perform the conventional diagnostic tests for pulmonary infections. The culture based methods that are currently used are slow, insensitive, may not distinguish colonization from infection and may be influenced by previous antimicrobial used. On the other hand, serological tests are also slow and poorly sensitive. Therefore, many authoritative guidelines on the management of pulmonary infection, such as, community-acquired pneumonia in adults do not support routine comprehensive microbiological testing, except in certain situations or in patients with severe disease.44., 45.\n",

Through scaling down size of compounds, Nano-Drug Delivery System (NDDS) can transform and improve the performance of many drugs to an extent not reachable by conservative formulations.89 For example, NDDS can be capitalized to encapsulate drugs and thereby (1) protect them from degradation, (2) target the drugs to particular cells/tissues/organs, releasing them in a restricted behavior as a response to a precise stimulus, (3) increase their solubility, (4) enhance their epithelial absorption and increase their blood circulation time, and (5) enhance their uptake by cells.90., 91., 92. Moreover, combined NDDS can concurrently detect and treat a disease by encompassing both imaging and therapeutic compounds, which are termed as theranostics.93 Nanomedicine could play a key role in the near future to achieve the highly desired modified medicine.94 Over the last few decades, the usefulness of the design and development of NDDS to overcome a variety of biopharmaceutical drawbacks in the diagnosis, prevention, vaccination, and disease treatment has been intensively explored by a large number of research groups globally, leading to an enormous number of scientific articles available in international journals. Moreover, it has generated a generous rational property platform. Nevertheless, and despite the fact that nanomedicine began as a discipline almost half a century ago, only a few NDDS have found their way to the market.94., 95. This experience could be explained by the lack of economic profitability, consumer mistrust and the lack of assurance because of poor information or education, unproductive regulation of novel and generic products, and feeble patent protection.96\n",

The conventional methods of diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary infections have limitations. The cultural and serological methods used for identification are slow, tedious, may not distinguish colonization from infection, and may be influenced by previous antimicrobials used for the treatment. In this context, PCR methods have been useful up to a certain extent for rapid identification of the causal organism. Nano-PCR and nanobiosensors may play important role in diagnosis of pulmonary infections. The long-term treatment of pulmonary infections by antibiotics and their inappropriate use has resulted in the multidrug resistance problem. This problem is mainly evidenced by tuberculosis, which has become a global problem; therefore, there is a need to develop alternative strategies for the treatment of tuberculosis. The use of nanotechnology in diagnosis of pulmonary infections and also for delivery of drugs would be of paramount importance. Nanoparticles, particularly biodegradable nanoparticles, can be used for this purpose. The activity of the nanoparticles can also be enhanced by their use in combination with existing antibiotics. Finally, nanotechnology will provide a viable alternative for the development of a long-term strategy to tackle the problems of diagnosis and drug delivery in pulmonary infections.",
