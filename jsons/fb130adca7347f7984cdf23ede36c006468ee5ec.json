Results were available within an average of 15 hours (range 10-19) at our institution. 8 UW Virology laboratory has the capacity to run 4000 cases per day of a \"non-rapid\" SC2 test called \"SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Qualitative PCR.\" Results are expected the same day for specimens received in the morning, next day otherwise. 8 In principle, the RT-PCR test has 100% sensitivity (true positive rate). Due to sampling error or biology of the disease, e.g., virus present in the lower, but not upper respiratory tract, in the clinical setting the test results in some false negatives. A 2020 study compared chest CT and RT-PCR on 51 patients in China. Chest CT showed a sensitivity of 98% while RT-PCR showed a sensitivity of 71% from the first throat swab or sputum. On the 2 nd RT-PCR, 23% of those initial negatives were positive, on the 3 rd test 4% were positive, and on the 4 th test 2% were positive. 9, 10 The current clinical sensitivity and specificity for SC2 testing using RT-PCR at UW is reported to be high, but actual values are unknown, as there is no gold standard for COVID-19 status.",

Consider that a respiratory droplet averages 6 microns, while the size of a single SC2 virion is reported to be 0.1 micron. 20 In the case of SC2, mask levels 1-3 provide acceptable protection.

Importantly, for dental healthcare workers aerosol-generating procedures (AGP) were only permitted in urgent or emergent settings with the proper PPE as emerging literature demonstrated high-risk viral transmission via respiratory droplets. 5,6 In addition, Washington Governor Jay Inslee ordered the closure of educational facilities on March 13, 2020, instituted a \"Stay at Home\" order on March 23, 2020, and directed the closure of all non-essential services on March 25, 2020. 7 University of Washington (UW) Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMS) Department carries the unique distinction of providing tertiary care for Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho. In addition, the Department services four different hospitals in the Seattle area and UW School of Dentistry (SOD).",

Effective March 12, 2020, all of UW Medicine and the SOD limited care to urgent and emergent cases in the clinic and operating room. Washington state Governor Jay Inslee's current proclamation suspends elective surgeries and procedures until May 18, 2020 although this is subject to change. 14 Guidelines defining urgent or emergent procedures varied and progressed rapidly over the month of March across the country. The American College of Surgeons (ACS) released guidance for triage of nonemergent surgical procedures on March 17, 2020 delineating elective surgeries into three tiers (low, intermediate, high), and further subdividing each tier into two categories (healthy or unhealthy). 21 Examples of operative procedures were given, but these were specific to general surgery. The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (AAOMS) followed a bulletin from the American Dental Association (ADA) released on March 19, 2020. 22 On March 26, 2020, Arbeitsgemeinschaft f\u00fcr Osteosynthesefragen Craniomaxillofacial (AO CMF) released recommendations for maxillofacial procedures ranging from facial trauma, oncologic care, and dental procedures. 18 As of April 13, 2020, UW Medicine moved forward with scheduling patients for procedures if delaying the procedure or operation for more than 90 days would adversely affect the patient's health outcome. 14 The UW OMS Department developed OMS-specific guidelines and provided it to all faculty and residents on March 23, 2020. Subsequently, incorporating the advice of local and national organizations, a surgical acuity scale was developed (table 1) 23-27 . This table is an adaptation of the ACS surgery acuity scale and synthesizes the recommendations from the AAOMS, ADA, AO CMF, and the Commission of Dental Accreditation (CODA) accreditation guidelines for OMS training programs.
