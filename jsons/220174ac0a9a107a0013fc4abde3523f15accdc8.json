            "text": "The rapid emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented and poses an unparalleled obstacle in the sixty-five year history of organ transplantation. Worldwide, the delivery of transplant care is severely challenged by matters concerning -but not limited to -organ procurement, risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, screening strategies of donors and recipients, decisions to postpone or proceed with transplantation, the attributable risk of immunosuppression for COVID-19 and entrenched health care resources and capacity. The transplant community is faced with choosing a lesser of two evils: initiating immunosuppression and potentially accepting detrimental outcome when transplant recipients develop COVID-19 versus postponing transplantation and accepting associated waitlist mortality. Notably, prioritization of health care services for COVID-19 care raises concerns about allocation of resources to deliver care for transplant patients who might otherwise have excellent 1-year and 10-year survival rates. Children and young adults with end-stage organ disease in particular seem more disadvantaged by withholding transplantation because of capacity issues than from medical consequences of SARS-CoV-2. This report details the nationwide response of the Dutch transplant community to these issues and the immediate consequences for transplant activity. Worrisome, there was a significant decrease in organ donation numbers affecting all organ transplant services. In addition, there was a detrimental effect on transplantation numbers in children with end-organ failure. Ongoing efforts focus on mitigation of not only primary but also secondary harm of the pandemic and to find right definitions and momentum to restore the transplant programs.",

In this context, especially maintaining organ transplantation care is complex, as numerous aspects related to donor and recipient management, need to be taken into account.

Is it safe to perform transplants from live donors? What are additional risks for transplant recipients in terms of immunosuppression and COVID-19? How should potential recipients be managed, both pre-and post-transplantation? Which treatments should be considered for transplant recipients with COVID-19? What are logistic implications and, most importantly, what is the impact of the outbreak on donation and transplant volumes and waitlist outcomes?

Under normal conditions, the Netherlands has approximately 1150 ICU beds, which is 6.7 ICU beds per 100.000 people. In comparison: the USA has about 34.7 beds per 100.000, Germany 29.2, Italy 12.5, France 11.6 and the UK 6.6. In the current pandemic, hospital capacity and critical care facilities are severely stressed by the number of COVID-19 patients. In order to provide optimal care for these patients, a centrally coordinated national effort was made to double ICU capacity to a total of 2400 in early April 2020. Regular ICUand medium care, including transplant care was scaled down to meet this demand. Regarding our concerns for donation and transplant rates we therefore raised national awareness through (social) media and by direct contact with the network of intensive care physicians involved in organ donation and organ tissue transplant coordinators. In addition, a letter was sent to relevant professional organizations and the national coordination center for capacity. Currently approximately 500 ICU beds are reserved to allow for (semi-)urgent non-COVID-19 care, including donation and transplantation.",

            "text": "Health care workers (HCW) involved in organ donation are at increased risk of acquiring and spreading SARS-CoV-2, since they work closely together and travel to various hospitals and visit virus hotspots. To preserve a safe organ donation chain, recommendations to reduce the risk of infection of HCW and transplant recipients were made recognizing limitations of available scientific evidence. First, SARS-CoV-2 testing of all deceased donors was implemented, since asymptomatic carriers and transmission through organ transplantation because they could not bear the extended waiting times. So far, no donor has been tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; in one donor the retrieval procedure was cancelled because of a high suspicion of COVID-19 based on chest CT, but with a negative PCR. This was followed by discussions about necessity of CT scan for donor screening. [13] A CT scan provides rapid information on COVID-19 in patients with moderate to severe symptoms and is of additional value in patients with a single false negative nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2. [14] To date, there is no data on sensitivity and specificity in asymptomatic patients and therefore not recommended in international guidelines. [15] The risk of losing additional organ donors because of false negative COVID-19 associated abnormalities on CT-scan such as groundglass opacities and consolidation in e.g. neurogenic oedema is deemed high. In this light, chest CT-scan is now only used in potential organ donors with negative nasopharyngeal swab but an inconclusive history for excluding COVID-19. To maintain social distancing during organ procurement, additional vehicles for transport to donor hospitals are used, and chauffeurs and HCW were advised to wear facial personal protection equipment (PPE). So far, no donation professionals were infected during procedures. To facilitate extra time needed for recipient test results to become available, allocation for liver, heart and lung transplantation is initiated before donor SARS-CoV-2 screening is known (Table 1A) . Additionally, the second recipient on the allocation list is allocated to minimize risk of donor loss related to prolonged cold ischemia times. Despite these efforts, donation volumes markedly decreased in the first month as the pandemic unfolded (15 March 2020-15 April 2020) compared to the months before ( Figure 1A ). The reasons for this are not completely clear. Traffic has decreased due to increased working from home, leading to less traffic accidents and trauma patients becoming organ donors. Also, there have been signs that people have become more reluctant to call for medical help, fearing to be a burden for medical professionals or to be infected with COVID-19 at a health care facility. This could also be the case when urgent medical assistance is needed, as in acute coronary syndromes, subarachnoidal bleedings et cetera. Finally, donor awareness among emergency physicians and intensivists could have decreased due to the strain put on them by the COVID-19 epidemic. Currently, we are investigating these issues. ",

In light of limited and contradictory evidence, and in part driven by stretched and overwhelmed hospital capacity, the Dutch transplant community was an early adopter of the recommendations made by Kumar et al. (Table 1B) . [6] In general, this led to prudence in performing kidney transplantation until the impact of induction and maintenance immunosuppression on COVID-19 is more understood. Deceased-donor kidney transplantation is considered case-by-case in a shared decision process with the patient, carefully weighing the urgency and benefit of transplantation against risks. This approach allowed for regional differences among centers while sharing a (Table 1B) . As discussed before, with progression of the COVID-19 pandemic, ICU capacity across the country is limited. As a result, per March 25, all heart and lung transplantcenters have limed their capacity for now to urgent cases with low life expectancy if not transplanted (Table 1B) . It is expected that the need for urgent lung transplantation may rise in the upcoming weeks for patients with severe ARDS. [25] As community acquired risk for COVID-19 is high, it is agreed that COVID-19 positive patients could return on the active organ waiting list after resolution of clinical symptoms and negative COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab or sputum PCR (Table 1B) ",

It was considered generally unethical and unsafe to expose healthy individuals to an operation that would potentially increase their risk ofacquiring SARS-CoV-2 in hospital or developing more significant COVID-19 postoperatively because of weakened immunity. As a result, all living-donor kidney transplant programs, a yearly volume of about 500 per year, have halted resulting in approximately 65 cancelled transplants in the 6 weeks since COVID-19 was first observed in the Netherlands. A national committee, consisting of relevant stakeholders including surgeons, nephrologists, ethicists and DTS, DTF and patient representatives, has been installed to determine under which circumstances living-donor kidney transplants can be restored (step-wise) in a safe and responsible manner. Living-donor pediatric liver transplantation, with a volume of 15 per year (50% of all pediatric liver transplants), however, continues. The decision to continue this program was taken after careful consideration of donor risks in view of the lifesaving nature of the procedure and absence of liver-replacement therapy. In anticipation of a prolonged period of low numbers of deceased donor organs, living donation is promoted where possible, and it is decided to transplant across the ABO blood group barrier in small children.",

Given the high waiting list mortality and suboptimal or absent alternative treatment options for end-stage disease, liver-, heart-and lung-transplantation should continue in principle. For liver it is agreed that transplantation should continue to be focused on the patients with the highest need, i.e. highurgent cases, those with Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) >20, or with otherwise life-threatening disease such as hepatocellular carcinoma approaching borders of Milan criteria",

In the Netherlands the transplant community quickly aligned. This resulted in the development of new national guidelines regarding organ donation in the ICU, test requirements for potential donors and organ recipients and national rules regarding the acceptance of organs by transplant centers. Worrisome, donation and transplant volumes markedly decreased and mortality on the waiting list of renal transplantation increased. The pandemic will have ongoing effects in the long term. Waiting lists will increase, resulting in increased waiting list mortality and worse pre-operative conditions. It is therefore of great importance to find the right momentum and definitions under which to fully restore transplant programs.",
