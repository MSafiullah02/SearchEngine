            "text": "The Department of Dentistry of National Taiwan University established in 1953 was the first local institution for dental education established in Taiwan. The earliest dental students in the Department of Dentistry of National Taiwan University were recruited in 1955 to open a new era of dental education in Taiwan. Although dentists are also a type of physician, the physicians under the \u201cPhysician Law\u201d in Taiwan did not include dentists at that time. Until 1967, the Legislative Yuan in Taiwan passed the new \u201cPhysician Law\u201d, and then dentists were recognized as \u201clegal physicians\u201d under the new \u201cPhysician Law\u201d. However, the new \u201cPhysician Law\u201d was formally implemented until 1975, after which the dentist was the only qualified dental practitioner with a dentist license. Since Japanese colonial period in 1916 (Taisho 5), the legal status of a dentist as a \u201clegal physician\u201d determined by \u201cTaiwan Dentist Ordinance\u201d has been delayed for almost 60 years.1 So we know that the development of dentists in Taiwan has been over a century since the Japanese colonial period when the dentists were first recognized as having a professional position by law.",

According to the statistics from the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the number of practicing dentists increased from 8944 in 2001 to 14,717 in 2018, with a total growth rate of approximately 64.5% and an average annual growth rate of 2%\u223c3%. Thus, the dentist manpower growth rate in Taiwan is relatively stable.2 However, because the practicing styles of dentists and physicians in Taiwan are very different, for dentists more than 85% of them serve in dental clinics, and less than 15% serve in hospitals, but for physicians 36.5% of them serve in private clinics and 63.5% serve in hospitals.3 A previous study found that the number of dentists in hospitals was 22% of the total number of dentists nationwide in 1986; this proportion decreased to 13% in 2004 and remained stable until 2008. Approximately half of the dentist manpower resources in hospitals concentrate in the northern region of Taiwan. In contrast, there are about 20% dentist manpower resources in the central region and 20% in the southern region of Taiwan. The eastern region and offshore islands have very few dentist manpower resources in Taiwan.4 Meanwhile, dental clinics designated as training institutions and teaching hospitals (especially medical centers) are usually concentrated in the northern and urban areas of Taiwan.5 It is consistent with the conclusions of a Japanese study reporting that prefectures with more dentists or dental clinics have a greater ability to offer postgraduate clinical training for dentists.6\n",

After 32 years, a total of 1312 hospital dentists have been added, with a mean annual increase of 41 dentists per year. Interestingly, during the period from 1986 to 2018, the number of hospital dentists decreased twice and increased significantly once. Since the National Health Insurance implemented in year 1995, the income of dental clinic dentists increased and the life quality of dental clinic dentists improved, while the number of hospital dentists decreased by 180 from 1316 in year 1994 to 1136 in year 1996. Afterwards, the number of hospital dentists increased slowly.12 However, when the disease of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) suddenly happened in year 2003, the number of hospital dentists decreased by 34 from 1326 in year 2002 to 1292 in year 2003. Moreover, the number of hospital dentists (1316 hospital dentists) in 1994 remained the same as that (1316 hospital dentists) in 2005. The National Health Insurance and SARS actually had a great impact on the number of hospital dentists, and the effect lasted for more than ten years.4 From 2005 until now, the number of hospital dentists increased by 62 per year. The postgraduate year training program for dentists (PGYD) implemented in year 2010. Although this system was not mandatory, the number of hospital dentists still increased gradually in the first three years from 1509 in 2010 to 1647 in 2012. It showed that the PGYD system was implemented hurriedly and thus many dental graduates were on the sidelines. However, in the next two years, the number of hospital dentists suddenly increased more than one hundred from 1764 in 2013 to 1870 in 2014, suggesting that the PGYD system matured gradually and accepted by the majority of dental graduates. The training period of the PGYD system was two years. Because the hospitals provide better resources for dentistry,13 an average of 60% of the dental trainees received their PGYD training in the hospitals.1 Therefore, after a significant increase in the number of hospital dentists for two consecutive years in 2013 and 2014, the increment returned back to a stable level afterwards.",

            "text": "In Taiwan, the Taipei City had the largest numbers of hospitals (including 9 medical centers, 11 regional hospitals, and 10 district hospitals) with dental department and a total of 3304 dentists. However, only one district hospital (none of medical center and regional hospital) was located in Penghu and offshore islands, and there were 36 dentists in Penghu County, 19 dentists in Kinmen County, and 6 dentists in Lienchiang County. Besides, there were 14 out of the 22 cities and counties without any medical center. Thus, the maximum gaps were greater than 728-fold for the hospital dentists, 858.67-fold for the dental clinic dentists and 550.67-fold for the overall dentists. More than half (52.8%) of overall dentists practiced in the northern region of Taiwan. There were 16 out of the 22 cities and counties with the number of dentists below the average (574 dentists). This finding indicates that there is a serious urban-rural disparity in dentist manpower resources in Taiwan. Based on the data reported in October 2019, this study also found a big difference in the number of people served by each dentist in different regions of Taiwan; i.e., the number of people served by each dentist was 801 for the Taipei City, approximately 1100\u20131400 for the Hsinchu City and Chiayi City, 4841 for the Chiayi County, 3896 for the Yunlin County, and 3867 for the Pingtung County. When compared with the data published 10 years ago in 2009, the number of people served by each dentist was 1036 for the Taipei City, 5765 for the Chiayi County, 4663 for the Yunlin County, and 4550 for the Pingtung County. According to the standard recognized by the Taiwan Dental Association, the lack of dentist manpower means that one dentist should serve more than 4000 people. As time goes by, in Taiwan there is a decrease in regions with insufficient dentist manpower. Moreover, an increased number of dentists have moved to non-urban areas because the implementation of the total budget system for dentists in the national health insurance since 1998. In addition, the increase in dentist manpower in urban areas is relatively low due to the approaching to the saturation point of dentist manpower in the urban areas. Although the health care policies are indeed an important factor influencing the growth of dentists, the phenomenon of oversupply of dentists in the urban areas and the urban-rural imbalance of dentists still exist in Taiwan up to date.10\n",

For example, in a Japanese study the Gini coefficient has been reported to be 0.405 and 0.335 for the distributions of dental trainees belonging to either a program or a facility, respectively. The same study also demonstrated that the disparities in the number of dental trainees in prefectures can be partly corrected by the redistribution of these dental trainees in the facilities-group system.8 According to the Gini coefficient values, we found that the geographical disparities caused by medical center dentists could be partly corrected by regional and district hospital dentists. Meanwhile, both the maximum gap and the coefficient of variation for the numbers of dental clinic dentists and overall dentists were similar, indicating that the current distribution of overall dentists is mainly determined by the dentists in the dental clinics that have several characteristics such as smaller organization, wider distribution, and higher proportion.",

Moreover, the geographical distribution of overall dentists showed a significantly greater imbalance in Taiwan, especially that of medical center dentists. This finding indicates that the problem of dentist oversupply and geographical imbalance of dentists may continue to deteriorate. Therefore, in order to prevent these untoward outcomes, we suggest that a mechanism for absolute control of the total dentist manpower should be implemented. For example, the number of enrolled domestic dental students should not be increased. Moreover, to enroll dental students by informal channels such as department transfer and dual majors should be forbidden. Furthermore, we also have to set a mechanism to control the sudden growth of a large number of dentists graduated from foreign dental schools. In addition, none of the dental department should be allowed to establish in Taiwan in the near future. With regard to the distribution of dentists, the hospital accreditation should include the item that a teaching hospital must have the responsibility to train the dentists for the remote areas of Taiwan. The government should grant subsidies to encourage dentists to serve in the remote areas, and combine the resources of the society into a joint plan to continuously promote the oral health care programs for people living in the remote areas.",
