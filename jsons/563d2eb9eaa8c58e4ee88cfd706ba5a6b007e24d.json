Studying social media can be informative to assess how we are collectively coping with this unprecedented global crisis. However, social media platforms are also populated by bots, automated accounts that can amplify certain topics of discussion at the expense of others. In this paper, we study 43.3M English tweets about COVID-19 and provide early evidence of the use of bots to promote political conspiracies in the US, but also as a tool to enable participatory activism to surface information in the English-speaking Twitter that could otherwise be censored in China.",

Social distancing measures, travel bans, self-quarantines, and business closures are changing the very fabric of societies worldwide. With people forced out of the safety and comfort of their life routines, social media take centerstage, more than ever, as a mirror to global social discussions. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to determine whether online chatter reflects genuine people's conversations or otherwise may be distorted by the activity of automated accounts, often referred to as bots (a.k.a., social bots, sybil accounts, etc.). The presence of bots has been documented in the context of online political discussion (A. Bessi & Ferrara, 2016; E. Ferrara, 2017; Luceri et al., 2019) , public health (Allem et al., 2017; Broniatowski et al., 2018; Hwang et al., 2012; Subrahmanian et al., 2016; Sutton, 2018) , civil unrest (Stella et al., 2018) , stock market manipulation (Emilio Ferrara, 2015) , the spread of false news (Grinberg et al., 2019; Shao et al., 2018; Vosoughi et al., 2018) , alongside with other tools such as troll accounts (Badawy et al., 2018 (Badawy et al., , 2019 Bail et al., 2019; Broniatowski et al., 2018; Luceri et al., 2020; Sutton, 2018) .",

We leverage a large Twitter dataset that our group has been continuously collecting since January 21, 2020, when the first COVID-19 case was announced in the United States (Holshue et al., 2020) . We use combinations of machine learning and manual validation to identify bots, and then use computational tools and statistical analysis to describe their behavior, in contrast with human activity, and their focal topics of discussion.

Both studies account for large-scale data collection from online platforms like Facebook and Twitter but do not emphasize the importance of information manipulation on such social media.

For example, (Alshaabi et al., 2020) analyzed 1,000 unigrams (1-grams) posted on Twitter in 24 languages during early 2020, and compared them with the year prior. The authors emphasize how the global shift in attention to the COVID-19 pandemic is concentrated around January 2020, after the first wave of infections in China started to phase off, and peaked again in early March, when the United States and several other western countries started to get more heavily hit by the pandemic. Their work suggests that social media mirror offline attention dynamics, and hints at the potential implications that diminished collective attention can have on the perception of gravity of this pandemic (or lack thereof).

            "text": "To further investigate this relation, in Figure 4 we show the distributions of account age of users at the time when they joined the COVID-19 discussion. The histogram portrays two very distinct stories for accounts in the top and bottom deciles of the bot score distribution: the former appear to be joining the COVID-19 in the early days since their creation: in fact, the average amount of time elapsed between account creation and first COVID-19 post for high bot score users is less than 100 days. In other words, the vast majority of high bot score accounts have been created relatively in proximity to the emergence of the COVID-19 outbreak and jump on this discussion with high intensity shortly after their creation. For example, over 80,000 high bot score accounts have been created between 50 and 100 days prior to their first COVID-19 tweet. Conversely, it is apparent that accounts in the bottom decile of the bot score distribution have been created significantly prior to the events. The second aspect that we evaluate is the provenance of these accounts. The attribution of account provenance is a well-known challenging task, because the Twitter API does not provide crucial forensic information that would be required for exact provenance attribution, such as the IP address of the machine or VPN server an account connects from. However, in lieu of such information, the best proxy at our disposal is the ability to reconstruct the server and data center that dispatched each tweet. There are two data centers, namely DC10 and DC11, that dispatch tweets, and 30 servers associated with these data centers. A simple language analysis of the tweets originating from the two data centers clearly suggests that DC10 is used to dispatch tweets originating in Asia, South-East Asia, Russia, and the Middle East. Conversely, DC11 dispatches tweets originating predominantly from Europe and the Americas. Figure 5 illustrates remarkable differences in the data center connectivity patterns between accounts in the top and bottom deciles by bot scores. In particular, it appears evident that DC10 (the data center that serves the Eastern world) dispatches almost 50% more tweets originating from high bot score accounts (blue bars) than from low bot score ones (orange bars). The opposite patterns appear to be true for DC11 (the data center serving the Western world): DC11 dispatches two-third more tweets from low bot score users than from top score ones. We can only speculate about the origin of such difference, in absence of the investigative tools necessary to get a definitive answer: prior investigations carried out by Twitter unveiled the systematic presence of information operations based in countries such as Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China. We speculate that a fraction of these may be carried out using bots, which in turn leave a digital trail associated with the data center used to dispatch tweets. This is a pre-print, currently under consideration for publication, which has not yet been peer-reviewed 13 Furthermore, Figure 6 provides additional insights on the discrepancies observed at the level of server connectivity. If no correlation existed between bot likeness and internet connectivity patterns, one would expect the same number of tweets originating from each server as a function of bot scores. However, Figure 6 clearly shows that certain servers serve many more high bot score users, and conversely others serve significantly more low bot score users. ",

We decided to avoid any other preprocessing step, such as removing hashtags shorter than some number of characters, or hashtags that do not appear above a certain threshold, in order to avoid skewing the results in any way.
