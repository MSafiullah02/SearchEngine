            "text": "Studies in cancer have recently yielded a broad range of molecular targets upregulated on the surface of tumor and tumor-associated cells [10], [11], [12]. Numerous markers have been identified and characterized for tumor cells, the surrounding stroma, and tumor endothelium [2], [10], [13]. Analysis of the NCI-60 cell line panel, which includes carcinomas of several origins (kidney, breast, colon, lung, prostate, and ovarian), tumors of the central nervous system, malignant melanomas, leukemias and lymphomas, has served to illustrate such marker heterogeneity in tumor cells [14], [15]. In parallel with the NCI-60, gene and protein expression analysis, pharmacological sensitivity of the cells to over 105 different chemical compounds has been registered [15], [16]. Indeed, for some genes, correlation of expression data to drug sensitivity profiles has uncovered mechanistic basis for the activity of certain drugs [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. Thus, conventional genomic and proteomic approaches have already identified several potential tumor markers and drug targets. However, despite such advances, correlation between drug activity and gene expression profiles has not yet been established for most of the compounds tested [21], [23], [24]. This may suggest the existence of unknown factors and the need to develop alternative methodologies to discover \u201cdruggable\u201d molecular targets.",

            "text": "Over the past decade, drug development has largely focused on approaches to selectively deliver reagents to the cells primarily responsible for or affected by disease. Characterization of molecular diversity at the disease cell surface level\u2014represented by membrane-associated proteins that are often modified by lipids and carbohydrates\u2014is the basis for the development of targeted therapies [2], [3], [8]. We have proposed that selectively expressed disease-specific receptors and corresponding ligands can be applied toward the development of systems for target-directed delivery of imaging agents, gene therapy vectors and cytotoxic drugs [8]. Natural or artificial ligands binding to surface receptors preferentially expressed on accessible cells may be used to direct therapeutics to sites of disease with potential for increased therapeutic windows [8], [25]. In general, tumor markers, exposed to the circulation, are likely to be found on endothelial and other blood vessel-forming cells [10], [26]. Coupling of tissue-homing compounds to a drug yields a targeted therapeutic that is likely to be more effective and less toxic than the parental drug [3], [8]. So far, molecules selected based on their homing to tumors have been used as carriers to guide the delivery of cytotoxic drugs [25], pro-apoptotic and cytotoxic peptides [27], [28], metalloprotease inhibitors [29], cytokines [30], imaging agents [31], [32], and genes [32], [33] in transgenic and xenograft mouse models of human disease. If proven feasible, target-directed therapeutic approaches will improve the treatment efficacy of various diseases by limiting the systemic exposure of other tissues to untoward effects.",

Gene expression determined by high-throughput microarray analysis has been used to survey the variation in abundance of many thousands of distinct transcripts from the NCI-60 tumor cell panel [14], [15]. Such data provided functional insights about the corresponding gene products in malignant tumor cell transformation [15], [17], [38], [39]. Information-intensive genomic approaches have yielded candidate tumor markers to be validated at the protein level in prospective studies [40]. From the standpoint of systemic drug targeting through differentially expressed vascular receptors, another initiative has been the identification of genes that are differentially expressed in neoplastic\u2014but not in normal\u2014endothelium [12].",

Protein microarrays have also evolved to allow fast high-throughput profiling of proteins that constitute biological samples, although this technology is still challenged by technical constraints [43], [44]. Ultimately, the ability to perform high-throughput profiling of protein expression may lead to the construction of the proteome for every tissue, in its normal state and in disease [45].",

Construction of such \u201cinteractomes\u201d operating within the context of the cell surface will help to identify ligand/receptor systems for the purposes of therapy targeting [50]. As technologies related to proteomics advance, new approaches for systematic molecular analysis of endothelium at the protein level are also surfacing [51], [52]. However, conventional methods for systematic protein expression and interaction analysis may well overlook potential diagnostic markers or targets because mere establishment of all proteins and their interactions present in a tissue does not necessarily take anatomical context into account. Some disease markers may be exposed in restricted locations in a way that makes them good drug targets irrespective of their expression level. Therefore, to generate a map of druggable receptors for disease-directed targeting, information derived from conventional protein profiling and binding assessment should be enhanced by integration with data from functional screening for circulation-accessible molecules.",

Excellent reviews summarize the experience with using random and semi-random peptide libraries in the context of various display platforms [71], [72], [73], [74], [75]. Among the most commonly used libraries are those with the general structure CXNC, which express random 5 to 9 amino acid residue-long peptides flanked by cyclized cysteines on each side [76]. Such libraries expressing cyclic peptides on filamentous phage surface have been used by or group [77]. Other groups have also used similar libraries displayed on lytic phage surface [56].",

            "text": "As evidenced by numerous studies within the past decade, cell surface receptor proteomes can be mapped by screening peptide libraries [8], [57], [78], [79], which is discussed in detail in Section 4.1. Peptide libraries have also been selected for motifs mimicking epitopes of antibodies produced in disease. For example Mintz et al. panned a library displaying random peptides on autoantibodies of prostate cancer patients, which led to identification of Grp78 as an antigen overexpressed by human prostate cancer [80]. In another study, Vidal et al. found an HSP90-mimic peptide as a human ovarian cancer antigen by epitope mapping on the pool of antibodies from ascites purified from ovarian cancer patients [81]. Together, there seems to be a theme emerging, in which stress-response chaperons become immunogenic in cancer. As importantly, peptide ligands selected from unbiased screens without any predetermined notions about the nature of the cellular receptor repertoire have been used for the subsequent identification of the corresponding target cell surface receptors [77], [78], [82], [83], [84], [85]. As discussed above, peptide targeting specific receptors on the surface of cells implicated in disease can also be used for directing imaging agents, cytotoxics, or gene delivery vectors [3], [8]. Artificial inhibitory peptides produced from transgenes have also been used to disrupt signaling intracellular pathways of interest in the Drosophila model [86]. In the future, such artificial gene products could be developed into vectors for diagnostic or therapeutic intent. Peptides may have other desirable benefits over currently used antibodies, because of their increased tissue penetration and diffusion, rapid blood clearance, or simplicity of synthesis in vitro and quality control.",

            "text": "It has been serendipitously observed that cell surface-binding peptides selected from display libraries are often similar to domains found in naturally expressed proteins [87], [88]. For example, a peptide may mimic a ligand of a vascular receptor via a motif sufficient for receptor recognition. Initially, Koivunen et al. isolated peptides targeting alpha 5 beta 1 integrin via mimicking fibronectin, peptides targeting alpha v beta 3 and alpha v beta 5 integrins by mimicking vitronectin, and peptides targeting alpha IIb beta 3 integrin by mimicking fibrinogen [76]. The majority of integrin-binding peptides contained the three amino acid long (tripeptide) motif Arginine\u2013Glycine\u2013Aspartic Acid (RGD). Based on these observations, it has been proposed and proven that in many cases binding peptide motifs mimic interactions of cell surface receptor with their natural ligands. Examples of biochemical unit recognition and binding of ligand motifs other than those based on the RGD/integrins, include Asparagine\u2013Glycine\u2013Aspartic Acid (NGR) binding to aminopeptidase N/CD13 [25], [82], Glycine\u2013Phenylalanine\u2013Glutamic Acid (GFE) to membrane dipeptidase [25], [82], [89], [90], and Aspartic Acid\u2013Proline\u2013Leucine (RPL) to VEGF-1 [78]. Thus, a stretch of three residues appears to provide the minimal framework for structure formation and protein\u2013protein interaction. As discussed in Section 4.1, our group has developed a bioinformatics platform based on the analysis of frequencies of tripeptide motifs within peptides selected in the screen for identification of the prototype receptor ligands mimicked by short peptides [85], [91], [92]. A number of comprehensive reviews summarize peptide motifs and their corresponding ligand/receptor systems identified by using phage display [67], [93], [94]. To interrogate early atherosclerotic lesions and explore plaque-associated endothelial cell proteome, Kelly et al. recently screened a phage-displayed random peptide library in ApoE-/-mice [95] to identify plaque-targeting peptides, similar to several proteins involved in atherosclerosis. Such findings may be translated into agents useful in early disease detection. The prospects for application of specific small peptides for specific needs of experimental targeted therapy have been critically evaluated over the past few years [3], [6], [96], [97]. Libraries of unnatural amide-linked oligomers encoded by RNA have also been designed to express and screen peptides consisting of unnatural amino acids [98], [99]. Techniques for peptide library construction constantly evolve [100]. Careful side-by-side comparison will be necessary to determine the best designs, which may actually be specific for individual display platforms. Recent approval of a number of peptides for clinical purposes reflects their recognition as promising therapeutic agents [101].",

            "text": "Presence of autoantibodies against various antigens has been revealed not only in infection, but also in autoimmune or allergic diseases [105], [106], [107] and in cancer [80], [108], [109], [110]. Factors that induce autoantibodies to self-antigens usually include protein mutations [111], [112], overexpression [113] or aberrant modifications [114] and cell localizations [114]. Serological identification of antigens by recombinant expression cloning (termed SEREX), which involves bacterial expression of cDNA libraries derived from tumor tissues and screening the recombinant proteins with autologous serum, has pioneered the combinatorial search for tumor antigens [115]. The list of disease antigens for which humoral immune response has been detected continues to grow, and is reviewed elsewhere [116], [117]. Several antibodies have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and have been used as therapeutics in the clinic for several years [101], [118]. An emerging target for anti-cancer therapies is angiogenesis, the process of vasculature sprouting from existing blood vessels, which is regulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor [119]. A recent example of an antibody with clinical anti-cancer activity is against the VEGFR pathway [120]. FDA approval of Avastin (bevacizumab), an anti-VEGF humanized monoclonal antibody is a breakthrough for treatment of various cancers by targeting tumor-related angiogenesis [121]. Other drug-conjugated antibodies directed at cancer antigens include Rituxan and Zevalin (anti-CD20) for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Herceptin (anti-HER2/neu) for metastatic breast cancer, Mylotarg (anti-CD33) for acute myeloid leukemia, Campath and Alemtuzumab (anti-CD52) for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and Erbitux (cetuximab) (anti-EGFR) for advanced colorectal cancer, among many others. Despite the recent developments of approaches to streamlined generation of antibodies [122], [123] and their humanization, traditional techniques for raising antibodies with desired activities and specificities remain to pose limitations.",

Recombinant antibody engineering remains a dynamic field and new approaches to construct libraries of antibody-like molecules displaying antigen recognition motifs are in development. For example, a library displaying variable domains of camelid heavy chain antibody domains was selected for antagonistic anti-EGFR nanobodies, which efficiently inhibit EGF binding to the EGFR, EGF-mediated signaling, and delay the growth of tumor xenografts [135]. Affibodies, the backbone of which is based one of the IgG-binding domains of staphylococcal protein-A have been randomized to create libraries selected on such cancer epitopes as HER2 and TNF-alpha to create agents potentially useful for imaging and therapy targeting applications [136], [137].",

            "text": "The first approach is the TCR display libraries, created by using single-chain variable domains of human TCR [153], [154], [155], [156]. In vivo, cytotoxic T lymphocytes use T cell receptors to recognize cell with abnormal antigen presentation, and activate antigen-specific cell killing. The specificity of TCR recognition toward MHC-presented antigens of altered cells makes them candidates for cell-specific drug delivery. Alternatively, TCR can be introduced in patients' T cells, which can be used for so called passive immunization. TCRs consist of alpha and beta chains, with each chain containing a variable (V) domain and a constant (C) domain. Similar to immunoglobulins' Fvs, V-domains of TCR contain hypervariable regions, which determine the specificity of T cell. The structure of the antigen-recognizing site of TCR is very similar to that of antibodies and, similar to antibodies, recombinant TCR can be expressed in bacteria as a single-chain TCR (scTCR), without loss of specificity for antigen [157]. Several groups have achieved scTCR expression in a display format [158] and made first steps toward selection of peptide-specific TCR from TCR libraries [159], [160]. However, due to low affinity of binding between TCR and MHC-I/peptide, further modifications of scTCR, like multimerization and mutations have been necessary for sensitive detection of target MHC-I/peptide. Yeast surface display of TCRs has also been shown possible by expression of scTCRs with permutated variable region residues proximal to the CD3 domain on yeast surface [155].",

Usage of TCR-like antibody molecules for studying MHC-I antigen presentation in health and disease, as well as for therapeutic purposes in cancer, infectious diseases, and autoimmune disorders, have been recently reviewed elsewhere [164].",

Display of random peptides library in the context of MHC for the purpose of patient T cell repertoire surveillance would enable high throughput identification of MHC-restricted peptides as targets for cell-specific therapy. Because in vivo interaction of MHC-peptides with TCRs takes place in the context of APCs and T cells, and is orchestrated by a group of supporting cell surface molecule interactions (CD4/MHC-II, CD8/MHC-I, CD2/LFA-3, LFA-1/ICAM-1, among others) [103], [145], [165] it is challenging to mimic this supramolecular structure in the context of display systems. In addition, MHC-peptide library construction and screening has been hampered because MHC presentation must be accompanied by non-covalently bound beta-2 macroglobulin (\u03b22M) [103]; therefore expression and folding of functionally active complex is Escherichia coli periplasm is technically difficult. Finally, the naturally low affinity of TCR binding to the MHC-peptide-\u03b22M complex (Kd = 0.1\u20133 \u03bcM), in particular in the absence of stimulating molecules mediating efficient immunological synapse [166], makes selection of display libraries complex.",

Unfortunately, the authors could not demonstrate interaction of displayed and folded single chain MHC/peptide complex with T cells. Consistent with low affinity of TCR binding to MHC/peptide increased avidity (achieved by tetramerization of MHC/peptide complex) allowed to visualize the interaction. In an attempt to design multivalent display of MHC-presented antigens, Le Doussal et al. has demonstrated bivalent fusion peptide \u2013MHC-I (H-2Kd)-\u03b22m presentation by a small fraction of phage particles [159]. Even with such a low ratio of bivalent phage, binding of Kd-displaying phage to a H2-Kd-restricted TCR immobilized on solid phase (as well as to Kd-restricted T cell hybridomas) has been shown. Still, no significant binding to relevant T cells was detected in the study. Therefore, further optimization of peptide-MHC display is still awaited for the TCR-mediated immune recognition to become a subject to productive screens for CTL antigens and their corresponding TCRs by using display technologies.",

Shorter fragments have a natural selective advantage because library units encoding them need less time for production and because they are less likely to pose constraints on the display unit function. These issues are relevant for virus/phage display methods (see Section 4.1), in which longer polypeptides have a higher chance of disrupting virion functions, such as assembly and infectivity. In addition, in the majority of phage display systems, proteins are generally expressed as C-terminal fusions with the N-terminus of the minor coat protein pIII for display on phage particles. Because full-length cDNAs generally contain several stop codons near their 3\u2032 end, this approach cannot be used for their expression on the phage surface. These problems have impeded the progress in construction and use of full-length cDNA libraries in display applications. Instead, initial breakthroughs were achieved with libraries displaying protein fragments [168]. Such protein domain libraries have been developed for antibody epitope mapping to directly and unequivocally identify the antigen. Given these advantages over other techniques, this approach has been widely used and has served to screen the whole yeast proteome for protein domains binding the second src-homology (SH3) domain of Bem1p protein [169].",

Plasminogen-activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) was among the first to be displayed on the pIII protein of filamentous phage [170]. Phage-displayed PAI-1 retained its capacity to form equimolar complexes with its target serine protease tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), as well as its ability to inhibit t-PA activity. Procedures for display cloning of cDNAs have evolved significantly since then, and monovalent phage display relying on helper phage (see Section 4.1) has made whole protein presentation generally possible [171], [172], [173], [174], [175], [176]. Considerable technical advances in systematic expression of cDNA libraries on the surface of bacteriophage has been achieved with the development of the Jun/Fos fusion approach [177], [178]. This system has been adopted for in vitro selection of catalytically active polypeptides [179]. An interesting attempt was undertaken to screen for extracellular proteins by using a cDNA library in which only proteins carrying the cell membrane localization domain can be displayed on filamentous phage [180]. Another perspective approach that may evolve as a tool for isolation of semi-natural molecules potentially superior to short peptides and antibodies is based on display of avimers: multidomain polypeptides shuffled from extracellular domains of receptors; in this study [181], avimers were multivalently displayed on phage, and selection of the library resulted in isolation of avimers with high avidity and the resulting sub-nanomolar affinity.",

            "text": "In addition to the widespread usage of immunological molecules, such as immunoglobulins and TCRs, naturally designed to display permutated polypeptide sequences, there are many other novel library frameworks that may be adopted for the presentation of polypeptides in display libraries [67]. Application of cell surface proteins as polypeptide presentation scaffolds is discussed in the corresponding sections for bacterial, yeast and mammalian cell surface display (see Section 4.2). Non-conventional scaffolds for protein display are discussed in an excellent recent review [74]. The key for selection of a library platform is the availability of exposed loops that link stable structural elements such as alpha-helices and beta-sheets. These loops are accessible for ligand binding and can accommodate sequence variation without changing the overall structure and stability of the underlying scaffold. Tertiary structures and rigidity of scaffolds can be modulated by the presence of stabilizing disulfide bonds linking spatially separated strands of the protein. Based on the architecture of their backbone, scaffold proteins can be classified into those consisting of: (i) alpha-helices, (ii) few secondary structures or irregular architecture of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, and (iii) predominantly beta-sheets. Examples of scaffolds with alpha-helical frameworks include Z-domain affibodies, immunity proteins of E. coli, cytochromes, and ankyrin repeat proteins and others. Examples of scaffolds with irregular structures include Kunitz domain proteins and PDZ domain proteins. Examples of scaffolds with beta-sheet frameworks include TCRs, CTLA proteins, knottins, and fibronectin type-III domains. Functional proteins have also evolved as attractive scaffolds for polypeptide display. For example, the beta-barrel green fluorescent protein (GFP), served as a combinatorial peptide library display scaffold, and peptides exhibiting anti-proliferative effects were selected [182]. Another useful function protein is executed by a series of small domains, termed protein transduction domains (PTDs), such as HIV-1 TAT protein, herpes simplex virus VP22 protein, or the third alpha-helix of Antennapedia homeodomain (penetratin), which promote the intracellular transport of peptides and proteins across cell membranes and into cells [183], [184]. Selection of cell membrane permeability libraries for PTD-displayed polypeptides could become an approach to identification of molecules with cell localization and/or function of interest, and labeling of these peptides for optical imaging, nuclear scintigraphy, or magnetic resonance imaging could have biological and medical applications [185].",

            "text": "In 1985, Smith, Scott and colleagues established a method for displaying polypeptides on the surface of filamentous M13-derived bacteriophage (phage) [59]. This technique was originally developed to map epitope-binding sites of antibodies by panning random peptide-phage libraries on immobilized immunoglobulins. Since then, phage display has been used as a powerful method to register polypeptide binding with a diverse range of basic biological, as well as technical and medical applications [77], [186]. Biology of phage has been well reviewed [189], [190], [191], [192]. In contrast to the lytic bacteriophage species (e.g., T4), filamentous phages replicate and assemble without killing the E. coli host. The most abundant capsid component, is the major coat protein pVIII, which is represented by approximately 2700 molecules. There are 5 molecules of the minor pIII coat protein at one end of the phage virion, which, along with the 5 copies of pVI, another minor coat protein, is involved in bacterial cell binding and in the termination of phage particle assembly during morphogenesis. The other end of the phage is capped by five complexes of minor coat proteins pVII and pIX, which are required for initiation and maintenance of phage assembly in the host bacteria. In libraries used most commonly, polypeptides to be displayed are expressed as fusions with the phage coat protein pIII [59], [77], [189]. During the phage assembly process, the resulting fusion proteins are transported to the bacterial periplasm or inner cell membrane and are incorporated into the phage particle along with the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) encoding the displayed fusion protein [189]. Thus, phage clones produced by host E. coli have peptide phenotypes coupled with their genotypes.",

In polyvalent phage display, each copy of the capsid protein (such as pIII) displays the polypeptide. Libraries of that type are based on vectors derived directly from the phage genome, such as fd phage [193], and encode all the proteins needed for phage replication and assembly. Polyvalent phage display is commonly used for selection of libraries of short peptides, display of which does not interfere with the essential function of the pIII protein. Monovalent phage display is the solution for cDNA libraries, which encode proteins or protein domains too large for the pIII protein to retain its function. In monovalent display, particles mosaic for recombinant and wild-type capsid proteins are produced by a phagemid vector encoding the fusion protein and by a helper phage, respectively. The purpose of the helper phage is to provide all the proteins required for phagemid replication, ssDNA production and packaging, hence allowing \u201cphage rescue\u201d.",

Rapid enrichment of library clones encoding binding polypeptides is achieved by phage library incubation with a target followed by removal of the non-reacting phage and amplification of binder clones in the host bacteria. Usually, three to five rounds of panning are sufficient to enrich for binding peptide sequences. The primary structure of the polypeptide corresponding to the clone is then deduced by sequencing the corresponding encoding DNA. In this manner, libraries with large diversity (approximately to 1010 unique individual sequences) can be created, amplified, stored, and screened against a target of interest.",

Standing aside from other M13-based protein display systems, the pVIII-based platform, which features many more copies of this coat protein per particle, may offer specific advantages for imaging applications [198], [199]. Recently, a multivalent display system alternative to pIII on filamentous phage pVII minor coat protein was reported [196]. The authors show that pVII protein is apparently not structurally compromised by fusion with large polypeptides, such as scFv antibody fragments, thus demonstrating the feasibility of utilizing pVII as a fusion partner without the necessity of co-infecting helper phage required for pIII phagemid systems. There is slow but steady progress in the design of phagemid vectors that allow efficient display of correctly folded functional proteins on phage, and new systems are constantly added for applications involving specific types of displayed proteins [200].",

Because filamentous phage are assembled in the cytoplasmic membrane and are secreted from infected bacteria without cell lysis, correct transfer of the hybrid capsid proteins across the lipid bilayer of the inner membrane of E. coli is prevented [201]. To overcome that limitation, alternative bacteriophage display systems that assemble their capsid in the cytoplasm and are released via cell lysis have been developed by using lytic bacteriophage such as T4 [202], T7 [172], and P4 [201], [203]. Libraries of peptides displayed from lytic phage species have also been created and screened [204], [205], and T7 Select cDNA libraries (Novagen) are often used for isolation of interacting proteins [56], [206].

There are features that make lambda phage potentially advantageous: ability to display multimeric proteins, lack of displayed fusion secretion requirement, and adjustable valency of the displayed fusions. Lambda display has been suggested as an alternative for poorly soluble proteins that tend to form inclusion bodies when expressed in bacteria [209]. Lambda-based systems are potentially attractive for protein display from cDNA libraries, and their input into functional proteomics progress is likely to increase [210]. There has been some follow up on the use of this system since its original inception, perhaps suggesting general application for lambda phage-displayed libraries [211], [212], [213].",

            "text": "Phage display has been routinely used to screen peptide or antibody libraries for ligands on purified and immobilized molecules in vitro\n[189]. Numerous research groups have employed phage display for selection of peptides binding to purified proteins of interest in projects aimed at identification of protein\u2013protein interaction pairs and mapping of their interaction domains [6], [8], [88], [174], [214]. Recent examples from our group include the selections for random peptides binding to SPARC [215], [216], integrins [76], [184], caspases [217], metalloproteases [29], and their exploitation as agents directing drug delivery. Examples of peptides and antibodies identified in such screens on prospective drug targets have been reviewed elsewhere [6], [88], [96], [200], [218]. Several recent developments on phage display application to protein\u2013protein interaction mapping are worth noting. The selectively infective phage technology (SIP) has been implemented for systematic registration of protein\u2013protein interactions [219], [220], and attempts to map protein\u2013ligand interactions by using whole genome phage libraries is underway [178]. Prediction and identification of protein interactions by using phage display in high-throughput is likely to complement and or synergize with other large-scale initiatives aiming at similar goals [87], [176]. Another example of interactome-type research is the screen for the membrane voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein (VDAC) epitopes by using a phage library expressing liver cDNAs and VDAC reconstituted into liposomes and captured on a chip surface. Remarkably, at least 40 % of hits were already reported voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) ligands, and some of the 55 novel interactions functionally blocked the channel [221]. Successful identification of peptide epitopes sets the basis for subsequent utilization of phage display for mapping protein interaction domains (Kolonin et al., unpublished).",

Recent examples of successful phage display selection on cells include the identification of peptides targeting vascular endothelial cells in gastric cancer [224] and of a VEGF-mimic [225]. It has been shown that phage particles displaying ligands binding to internalizing receptors, such as integrins, can undergo efficient uptake by targeted cells. This has been shown to be the case for both peptides [226] and antibodies [227] displayed on M13. Based on that notion, phage display technology has been successfully mobilized for targeted gene delivery into mammalian cells [32], [228], [229].",

The subsequent research of our group has combined random peptide library selections with a platform strategy comprised by advanced molecular biology and bioinformatics, as well as utilization of clinically-annotated patient samples. This approach allows to quickly and efficiently identify functional cell surface receptors in conjunction with their ligands that can be directly used as prototypes for therapeutic targeting. For example, peptides targeting tumor receptors have been identified, functionally explored, and used in pre-clinical studies [6], [25], [32], [84], [96], [97], [199], [233], [234]. Below, we expand on several examples of recent developments that illustrate how this systematic strategy can be applied for clinical cell surface proteome mapping of human tumors and vascular beds.",

This presents the proteome of the tumor cells as potentially directly targetable with systemically administered therapeutics. To advance the construction of the cell surface ligand/receptor map of human cancers, the NCI-60 panel of human cancer cell lines from different histological origins and grades [14], [15] was recently systematically analyzed with phage display [91]. We used BRASIL [78] to select peptides binding to receptors expressed by the NCI-60 cells from a combinatorial library. The selected peptides were surveyed by using a comprehensive strategy (Fig. 2\n). By statistical analysis of peptide motif sequences, each NCI-60 cell line was assigned a unique set of peptide motifs that were isolated during the selection for cell surface binders. We showed that tumor cells can be grouped by profiles of their phage display-derived peptide ligands directed to differentially expressed cell surface receptors [91].",

Analysis of selected peptide motif sequences grouped cells lines according to profiles of motif distribution within the NCI-60. Some of the peptide motifs were found within proteins known to bind the receptors that had NCI-60 expression profiles matching cell line recognition profiles of the peptides, and that are implicated in cancer. Candidate targeted cell surface molecules were identified, which included many tyrosine kinase receptors. As a proof of principle, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), known to be upregulated in various cancers, was validated as a target of a pool of tripeptides, which were isolated as candidate mimics of biological EGFR ligands. Results of this feasibility study suggest that tumor cells can be grouped by profiles of their peptide ligands directed to differentially expressed cell surface receptors [91].",

In some cases, the data on homing ligands and their receptors generated in animal models have been useful for validation of corresponding drug targets in human disease. However, it has become clear that information derived from studies in mice cannot always be easily translated into real clinical applications because of the species-specific differences in expression of many vascular targets [237]. Inconsistent recapitulation of the results from the murine models to human biology may have correlated with frequent lack of immediate success in translational clinical trials. The uncovered cross-species variation in expression or presentation of tumor markers, with PSMA [251] and TEM7 [12], [252] serving as examples, could perhaps account for the lack of efficacy. A mere difference in tissue site, level, or time of expression of a vascular protein between mice and men may partially explain why pro-drugs identified by using mice undergo unexpected localization in humans and, therefore, are inappropriate for ligand-directed targeting. Thus, all in vivo phage display data derived from animal models must be carefully validated before being applied to clinical studies.",

As an initial step, we have selected a phage-displayed random peptide library by analyzing peptide motifs distribution to bone marrow, prostate, fat, muscle and skin in a cancer patient [85], [253], [254]. We performed a high throughput analysis of motifs recovered from five organs: bone marrow, white fat, skeletal muscle, prostate, and skin. For each organ, we identified frequently isolated short (tripeptide) motifs, which could direct binding in blood vessels upon phage library intravenous administration, contained within selected peptides. The large-scale survey of almost 50,000 tripeptides showed that the distribution of combinatorial peptides in human tissues was non-random [85]. Out of the 25 organ-homing tripeptides 11 were enriched in a single organ, whereas the others were enriched in multiple organs, consistent with the working hypothesis that some of them bind to tissue-specific endothelial markers and others bind to ubiquitous vascular cell surface molecules [85].",

A large follow-up study with well-annotated archival human tissues revealed that the expression of the IL-11R\u03b1 is increased in prostate cancer and in associated vasculature, in particular upon prostate cancer metastasis; IL-11R\u03b1 was also evaluated as a target in primary and metastatic prostate cancer by using morphological and functional analyses [226]. Importantly, although IL-11R\u03b1, has been recognized as a target in human cancer, the specific requirements for ligand-receptor binding and molecular mechanisms that enable signal transduction were not as well understood. Based on our phage display selection data, we designed and validated an in-tandem strategy of binding assays and site-directed mutagenesis and NMR spectroscopy [225] and showed that the GRRAGGS sequence mimics a new functional protein-binding site within IL-11 (Card\u00f3-Vila et al., submitted).",

Thus, systematic characterization of the vasculature by using this \u201cconventional\u201d in vivo setup has been rate-limited by the need to separately perform individual multi-round screens for motifs homing to each tissue studied. For instance, the reported patient screening [85] involved only a single round of selection and, therefore, required statistical analysis of very large numbers of phage clones (thousands, as opposed to hundreds in a conventional screen) to identify homing peptide motifs. For systematic vascular mapping, there are also practical limitations to the number of phage clones that can be routinely processed, thus requiring further methodology optimization. In order to meet such challenge, we have recently introduced a comprehensive strategy to use phage display for synchronous identification of organ-homing peptides for multiple tissues in a screen simultaneously [92]. This strategy allows one to survey an order of magnitude fewer peptide sequences than those analyzed in the original method [85] due to statistical power generated in subsequent selection rounds (Fig. 4\n). We evaluated our approach in mice by performing a screen to isolate peptides independently segregating to six different organs and developed a statistical analysis platform for identification of motifs selectively enriched in targeted tissues. Finally, to demonstrate the efficiency of this approach, we biochemically validated one of the identified pancreas-homing peptides as a mimic of peptide hormones that bind to prolactin receptor [92]. Improved statistical algorithms for analyzing peptide sequences isolated in serial synchronous selections by using Bayesian mixture models for complex high-dimensional count data are currently being developed (Ji et al., in press).",

Real-time PCR was also adopted to monitor the changes in phage binding to cardiac vascular epitopes upon aging [261]. A method with potential for clinical diagnostics is phage display-mediated immuno-PCR (PD-IPCR), which is a modification of immuno-PCR (IPCR) performed with a recombinant phage particle instead of a monoclonal antibody [262]. In PD-IPCR, the phage-displayed scFv and the encoding phage DNA combine the detection and the template units.

Recovery of phage binding to cells of interest was successfully assisted by LCM in mice after in vivo library administration [260]\n, as well as after ex vivo application of phage to freshly collected oral squamous cell carcinomas [263].

Similar approaches have been undertaken to the identification of peptides with inhibitory properties. For instance, random peptide libraries have been used as a source of Pseudomonas aeruginosa MurD amide ligase inhibitors, thus providing a prototype compound to target cell wall biosynthesis of this pathogen [268]. In another study, anti-protective antigen peptides were selected from a phage library by competitive panning with lethal factor precursor of the anthrax toxin [269]. The selected 12-mer peptides were synthesized in tetra-branched form and were modified for inhibitory efficacy, as prototypes of artificial anti-anthrax protective antigens. Similarly, enzymatically active kallikrein 2 (hK2), a serine protease that may mediate metastasis of prostate cancer, was subjected to combinatorial selection with phage libraries [270]. Several selected peptides were validated as inhibitors of hK2enzymatic activity and, therefore, as a prototype drug against prostate cancer. In another approach, phage display library based on connexin43 (Cx43)-binding RXP motif has been used to identify novel peptide sequences that bind Cx43 and modify Cx43 regulation [271]. Moreover, phage display has been used to functionally target specific cell compartments of non-protein nature. For example, a peptide library was selected for peptides that bind to liposomes in pH-dependent manner, some of which were able to cause leakage of liposome contents [272]. Lipopolysaccharides were also recently explored as targets of peptides displayed by phage libraries [273].",

Various computational tools and algorithms have been generated to facilitate prediction of protein interaction sites based on phage display binding data [276]. Combination phage-displayed random peptide library selection with such computational predictions have, for instance, allowed mapping a neutralizing antibody epitope on the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [277], as well as to define cellular coronavirus receptor and thus approaches to development of SARS inhibitors [278].",

Baculovirus envelope modification with display technology was also performed to direct viral tropism to tumor cells [291]; tumor-homing peptides originally identified by in vivo phage display were displayed on the baculoviral surface fused with the transmembrane anchor of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein. The targeted virions specifically bound to and internalized into human tumor cells. Display of tumor-targeting ligands appears to enhance baculovirus-mediated gene delivery [291].",

Directing AAV to cells of interest with targeting adaptor peptides conjugated to an adenovirus-binding moiety [33], as well as incorporation of tumor-targeting peptides into recombinant AAV capsid for directing virus tropism [293] has been successful. As proof-of-concept, an AAV-based library displaying random peptides has been designed and screened on human coronary artery endothelial cells. Selected peptide motifs enhanced transduction in coronary endothelial cells but not in control cells, confirming AAV as a viable targeting vehicle [294]. Recently, AAV was also tested for in vivo display applications [249]. Peptides identified based on their homing to rat lungs and brain were incorporated into the VP3 region of the AAV-2 capsid. The resulting viruses displayed the peptides on the virion surface that retargeted the transgene-carrying viruses to the expected vascular beds in vivo\n[249]. Recently, for the first time, our group has also reported delivery of reporter and therapeutic genes in vivo by using a hybrid vector with genetic sic-elements merged from an M13 derived bacteriophage and adeno-associated virus [32]. We termed this new double-stranded AAV/single-stranded bacteriophage vector AAV/phage (AAVP). AAVP carrying a transgene cassette for its intracellular conversion from single stranded to double stranded DNA, was targeted to integrin-expressing cells and enabled tumor transduction and molecular genetic imaging in tumor models [32].",

            "text": "Cell display systems feature transfection of cells with the library DNA and expression of library-encoded polypeptides as fusions with extracellular receptors (Fig. 1). Selection of a bacterially expressed library of scFv antibodies was introduced by using the periplasmic expression with cytometric screening (PECS) technology [266]. In this approach periplasmic localization of library proteins served as a dialysis bag to selectively retain scFv-bound, but not free, ligand. Fluorescent labeling of the ligand allows one to perform cytometric screening for cells containing antibody-antigen complexes. Since then, the ability to display polypeptides of interest as fusions to proteins of the bacterial envelope has also been tested as a potential alternative to viral/phage display [297]. Bacterial display can also serve to display functional enzymes, vaccine antigens and polypeptide libraries [298]. Outer membrane proteins of Gram-negative bacteria have been used as carrier proteins to present foreign peptide epitopes on bacterial cell surfaces [299]. Foreign gene products have been fused to surface-accessible regions of porins and other outer membrane proteins such as OmpA and the OmpC, PhoE, LamB, FhuA, and BtuB [299], [300]. Insertions, of more than 100 amino acid residues can be tolerated in certain cases. Another class of bacterial surface proteins for display is autotransporters, which contain the translocator domain mediating the outer membrane trafficking of the passenger [301]. Replacement of the natural passenger domain of autotransporters with heterologous proteins leads to their display at the bacterial surface by the translocator domain. Surface display of a human cathepsin G inhibitor indicated that bacterial peptide libraries can be subjected to functional screening based on target enzyme labeling [302]. Despite proof-of-principle experiments, side-by-side comparison of bacterial and phage display of the same peptide library in search of target-binding motifs indicated that the phage-based platform may be advantageous [303].",

Yeast display provides an advantage over bacteria-based technologies in cases when cell-surface and secreted proteins require endoplasmic reticulum-specific post-translational processing for efficient folding and activity [305]. To date, yeast display has allowed presentation of numerous functional proteins on cell surface. For example, a hetero-oligomeric Fab fragment of a catalytic antibody was expressed with the tandem-linked C-terminal half of \u03b1-agglutinin in conjunction with expression of secreted Fd fragment of the heavy chain. The combined Fab fragment assembled on the yeast cell surface catalyzed hydrolysis of the corresponding substrate [306]. In addition to antibodies, yeast display has also been developed to express T cell receptors [155]. In a subsequent study, Holler et al. screened a yeast display library of V-alpha CDR3 mutants for higher affinity soluble monomeric TCR variants and selected TCR variants with affinities in low nanomolar range [153]. As an advantage over the wild-type TCR, high-affinity TCRs were capable of directly detecting peptide/MHC complexes on antigen-presenting cells. Recently, Jin et al. applied yeast display for molecular evolution of a human integrin protein and EGF; as a result, protein mutants with remarkable affinity for physiological interactors were identified [307].",

An important breakthrough in mammalian display technology was an achievement of single-chain Fv expression on the cell surface display of 293T cells [194]. To prove the principle that affinity maturation is possible in mammalian systems, cells expressing an antibody with high affinity were efficiently enriched from a large excess of cells expressing a lower affinity antibody. Moreover, selection of a combinatory library randomized in an intrinsic antibody hotspot was also successful. Although this approach is challenged by the inherent limitations of library management in mammalian cells, development of targeting systems such as this will become relevant in biomedical applications.",

            "text": "Ribosome (polysome) display was among the first cell-free in vitro display assays developed [311]. In ribosome display, selection is based on the ternary complexes formed as a result of in vitro translation of proteins and their attachment to the ribosome and to the encoding mRNA. Stabilization of mRNA-ribosome-polypeptide complexes in a rabbit reticulocyte translation system is achieved by modulation of magnesium ion concentration and by terminating polypeptide elongation either with chloramphenicol or with low temperature (Fig. 1). The immobilized mRNA is then amplified from the polysome complexes bound to the target for further rounds of selection. Ribosomal display has been proven a valuable method for selecting high affinity compounds from diverse libraries [308]. Applications of ribosomal display in biomarker identification, imaging and targeting are likely to further evolve [312]. For example, ribosome display was used for selection of DNA-binding proteins [313]: three different zinc finger DNA-binding protein libraries, containing randomized sequence in each finger, were selected on biotinylated target DNA fragments bound to streptavidin magnetic beads, leading to the isolation of semi-synthetic factors with potentially novel transcriptional activities. A ribosomally-displayed combinatorial library of ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) was selected for binders of MAP-kinases [314]. Remarkably, a single round of ribosome display selection lead to isolation of a specifically binding ligand with micromolar affinity. After subsequent selections, some of the enriched JNK1, JNK2 and p38-specific DARPins with nanomolar affinity were confirmed to be functional in the cellular cytoplasm. Moreover, it has been shown that affinity maturation of phage antibody populations by using ribosome display can generate high affinity antibodies with K(d)s in the picomolar range without the use of error prone mutagenesis, whereas the highest affinity antibody (scFv fragment) produced by phage display had K(d)s in the nanomolar range [143]. An improvement of cell-free translation system was achieved by combining recombinant E. coli protein factors with purified 70S ribosomes: higher selection-specific cDNA yields were observed [315]. Further attempts to prevent dissociation of the tripartite RNA-ribosome-polypeptide complexes may further improve the robustness of the system and may make ribosomal display a user-friendly method for combinatorial selection.",

During in vitro translation, ribosomes reach the junction between the mRNA and the engineered DNA linker and stall, which allows for puromycin entry of the ribosomal A-site and the formation of a stable amide bond with the encoded peptide (Fig. 1). As a proof-of-principle, fusions between an mRNA molecule and its encoded myc epitope peptide were enriched from a pool of random sequence mRNA-peptide fusions by immunoprecipitation [316]. In a continued effort of using mRNA display to isolate high-affinity ligands, various combinatorial or semi-combinatorial (randomized trypsin inhibitor EETI-II) peptide libraries have been selected and enriched for binding motifs [317]. A unidirectional nested deletion library displayed from mRNA was used to map epitopes of an anti-polyhistidine monoclonal antibody, leading to isolation of a high-affinity polyhistidine peptide, confirming the viability of this approach [75]. In addition, mRNA display library has been facilitated by the design of combinatorial libraries encoding peptides synthesized with unnatural amino acids [98], [99]. Such non-biological polymers may have potentially far-reaching advantages due to their extended spectra of binding targets and biological stability. However, the general applicability of this technology remains to be determined at this time.",

P2A is an endonuclease that initiates a rolling circle replication process by binding to the viral origin (ori) and introducing a single-strand discontinuity (nick) in the DNA, priming DNA synthesis by using the host replication machinery, and finally attaches to the molecule of DNA from which it has been expressed through a (still poorly understood) cis-activity. These features enable pools of polypeptides that are linked to P2A to be synthesized in vitro so that they also become covalently attached to their own coding DNA (Fig. 1). While potentially capable to avoid many of the problems limiting other display systems, CTD has as yet been underutilized. Recently, however, Reiersen et al. reported the suitability of CTD for library selection [318]. The covalent antibody display (CAD) was used for specific selection of anti-tetanus toxoid scFvs from a V-gene library with 50 million different members prepared from human lymphocytes. Although vulnerability of DNA and RNA complexes fundamental for in vitro display methods may pose a problem, in the future, in vitro display technologies could become instrumental not only for directed evolution of proteins, but also for in vivo selections and other applications currently limited to phage display.",

Analysis of peptide motifs targeting an individual receptor provides a basis for rational drug design of targeted peptidomimetics, which is currently being undertaken based on the ligand-directed map of IL-11/IL-11R\u03b1 interaction mapped with in vivo phage display as a follow up of the human vascular mapping effort [85]. Investigational New Drug (IND) studies are planned for three peptidomimetic drugs from our group against cancer [80], [226], [233] and obesity [84]. Advancements in tools for peptide structure analysis open new possibilities for rapid and efficient identification and validation of receptors targeted by peptides in context-directed and functional screenings [41]. For example, Giordano et al. used NMR spectroscopy to understand the structural basis of the interaction between a VEGF-mimic mimic peptide and the VEGF receptors, which led to the identification of three key residues involved in ligand-receptor binding [225]. Rational anti-angiogenesis drug design based on this information is currently under development (Giordano et al., unpublished).",
