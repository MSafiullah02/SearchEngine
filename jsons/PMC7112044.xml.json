            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a life-threatening form of atypical pneumonia that rapidly spread in Asia, North America and Europe in early 2003 [1], [2]. SARS is characterized by high fever, malaise, rigor, headache and non-productive cough or dyspnea and may progress to generalized interstitial infiltrates in the lung, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation [3]. The causative agent of SARS is a coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1], [2], [4]. Its 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro), a chymotrypsin-like cysteine proteinase which is essential for viral replication, has been recognized as a key target for anti-SARS drug design [4]. The active site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro has a catalytic dyad with Cys145 as the nucleophile and His41 as the general base [4], [5]. This proteinase cleaves the initially translated polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab at 11 conserved interdomain sites, in which the P1 position has a well-conserved Gln residue, and the P2 position has a hydrophobic amino acid residue [6].",

            "text": "Currently, there are no effective anti-viral agents for the treatment of SARS. However, rational design and library-based screening have identified some small molecules that are potent inhibitors of 3CLpro, such as the HIV proteinase inhibitor TL-3 [7], bifunctional aryl boronic acids [8], thiophenylcarboxylate [9], keto-glutamine analogues [10a], AG7088 analogues [11], (a), anilides [12b], benzotriazole esters [12c] and pyridinyl esters [10b]. In our previous studies, we demonstrated that a series of 5-halopyridin-3-yl aromatic esters act as very potent covalent inhibitors of 3CLpro with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range (Fig. 1\n) [10b]. These compounds initially bind competitively and strongly to the active site, but are then hydrolyzed by the enzyme as substrates and released. Despite their potent inhibition of 3CLpro and relatively long half life in buffer at neutral pH, they are likely to be problematic as drug candidates because of the propensity of esters to be rapidly hydrolyzed by lipases, esterases and other enzymes in mammalian cells. These compounds and many of the other reported inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CLpro can potentially also react non-specifically with other thiols or nucleophiles in mammalian cells, thereby leading to toxicity.",

            "text": "In order to develop stable and non-covalent inhibitors based on these pyridinyl esters, the ketone 5 was initially investigated as a potential SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitor (Fig. 2\n). The carbonyl of this relatively unreactive compound could form a hemithioacetal with the enzyme\u2019s active site thiol, but this should be a reversible process. Disappointingly, compared to its oxa analogue, the pyridinyl ester 1 (91% inhibition at 100 \u03bcM concentration, IC50\n = 7.9 \u03bcM, Fig. 1), the ketone analogue 5 displays no inhibition at 100 \u03bcM concentration [10b]. However, it seemed that corresponding fluorinated ketones might be better inhibitors, as they possess the combined features of a more electrophilic carbonyl group and a chemical structure that fits the enzyme active site. The fluorinated ketones should be more stable in vivo than the corresponding pyridinyl esters, and would also avoid the hydrolysis problem that leads to the reactivation of the enzyme [10b]. Furthermore, the difluoromethylene moiety has been proposed as a mimic of an oxygen atom in biological systems [13]. In the present work, we examine a group of methylene ketones and corresponding mono- and di-fluorinated methylene ketones as potential SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors.",

Compounds 6 and 7 were then tested as inhibitors of SARS 3CLpro using a continuous fluorometric assay in which enzymatic cleavage of an internally quenched fluorogenic peptide substrate, (Abz-SVTLQSG-Tyr(NO2)R) leads to enhanced fluorescence (a), (b). The monofluoro ketone 6 shows weak inhibition against 3CLpro (10% at 100 \u03bcM concentration, Table 1\n), and no improved inhibition was observed after 2 h preincubation with the 3CLpro. However, the di-fluoro ketone 7 displays stronger inhibition against 3CLpro (38% at 100 \u03bcM concentration, Table 1). Similarly, preincubation of 7 with the 3CLpro for 2 h shows no improved inhibition. These results suggest that the fluorinated ketones 6, 7 are non-covalent and completely reversible inhibitors for SARS 3CLpro. As proposed, fluorination leads to the substantial improvement in the inhibitory activity against the 3CLpro. The di-fluoro ketone 7 appears to be a reasonable mimic of the corresponding pyridinyl ester 1 (91% inhibition at 100 \u03bcM), with only 2- to 3-fold less potent inhibition. As the pyridinyl ester 1 (IC50\n = 7.9 \u03bcM) is only a moderate inhibitor among the pyridinyl esters (2\u20134, IC50\n = 50\u201363 nM), it seemed that the difluoromethylene ketone mimics of the very potent esters (i.e. 2\u20134) could inhibit SARS 3CLpro very strongly in a non-covalent and reversible fashion.",

The testing results, which only examine the initial binding affinity, are listed in Table 1. Surprisingly, most of the methylene ketones (11a\u2013c) as well as their fluorinated methylene ketone analogues (12a\u2013c, 13a\u2013c) inhibit 3CLpro poorly. However, the methylene ketone 11d and its fluorinated methylene ketone analogues 12d, 13d are good inhibitors of 3CLpro with IC50 values of 13\u201357 \u03bcM. Interestingly, introduction of a fluorine substituent to this group of inhibitors bearing the p-chlorophenyl ring (11d, 12d, 13d) decreases the inhibitory activity \u223c2-fold, which stands in contrast to results with inhibitors 11a\u2013c, 12a\u2013c, 13a\u2013c that are lacking this ring. This suggests that the three-ringed inhibitors (11d, 12d, 13d) may have a different binding mode from the two-ringed inhibitors (11a\u2013c, 12a\u2013c, 13a\u2013c). After 2 h preincubation of 25 \u03bcM methylene ketone (11d) or fluorinated methylene ketones (12d, 13d) with 3CLpro, no improved inhibitory activity is observed, indicating that these compounds act as non-covalent fully reversible inhibitors of SARS 3CLpro. The inhibition mechanism was also examined on a longer time scale using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) studies. After mixing 10 equivalent of inhibitor 11d, 12d or 13d with 1 equivalent of 3CLpro, and incubating the solution for 24 h, no mass change is observed in the major mass peak of 3CLpro. This further demonstrates that compounds 11a\u201313d utilize a non-covalent reversible mechanism of inhibition. These compounds represent a new class of SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors, and to our knowledge, are among the most potent non-covalent and reversible inhibitors of this enzyme.",

            "text": "To gain further insight into the inhibition mechanism, modeling studies (Fig. 2) of 3CLpro with inhibitors 11a\u201313d were conducted [10b]. Since the S2 and S4 pockets in the active site of 3CLpro are relatively large, the shorter two-ringed compounds (e.g. 11c) cannot occupy the maximal volume in these S sites in any docked conformations. However, due to their extended end-to-end length, the three-ringed compounds can occupy more of the binding surface from the S2/S4 to the S1 pocket. Therefore, the three aromatic ring compounds (11d, 12d, 13d) are more effective in blocking the binding of substrates into the active site, and thus exhibit better inhibition against 3CLpro than the two-ringed ones, as revealed in the enzymatic assay. Based on our previous modeling studies (b), [23], the three-ringed esters utilize a non-covalent and reversible mechanism of inhibition in a S4\u2013S1 binding mode, by blocking entry of substrates into the active site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. This is supported by a recently reported crystal structure of a three-ringed thioester with the 3CLpro\n[24]. Docking results suggest that these ketone analogues (11d, 12d, 13d) adopt binding conformations similar to that of the corresponding esters (e.g. 4). Each of these three compounds is oriented in an extended conformation from S4 to S1 pocket, with the oxygen atom of their furan ring forming a hydrogen bond with the main chain NH of Glu166, an interaction that was also predicted for the three-ringed esters. The pyridinyl moiety preferentially binds inside the S1 specificity pocket, which limits the possible spatial orientations of the substituents at the \u03b1-position of the central ketone group. In the 3CLpro:12dand 3CLpro:13d complexes, the fluorine substituents of the inhibitor point towards the main chain carbonyl oxygen of His164 (Fig. 2). This pushes 12d and 13d slightly out towards the solvent. Thus, the van der Waals interactions between the fluorinated compounds and the active site residues of the enzyme are likely to be weaker than those for 11d.",
