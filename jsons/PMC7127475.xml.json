They are generally effective at reducing the severity and duration of clinical signs, but do not prevent infection or shedding (Radford et al., 2007). The high level of antigenic variability amongst FCV isolates has raised concerns regarding the level of cross protection afforded by older vaccines (Radford et al., 2006), and the apparent limited protection afforded against isolates associated with FCV-VSD (Hurley and Sykes, 2003).

Efficacy of both human and feline interferons has been demonstrated in vitro against FCV (Fulton and Burge, 1985, Mochizuki et al., 1994, Taira et al., 2005, Truyen et al., 2002) and the use of rFeIFN-\u03c9 has been reported to have a positive therapeutic effect in FCV infected cats in experimental and field efficacy trials (Ninomiya et al., 1991, Ohe et al., 2008). Treatment with rFeIFN-\u03c9 was also associated with an improvement in clinical signs in cats with refractory FCGS in a double-blinded placebo-controlled study, however FCV shedding was not monitored, making it unclear whether the improvement was due to the antiviral or immunomodulatory properties of interferon (Hennet et al., 2011). Recently, feline calicivirus specific antiviral phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) were tested in naturally occurring outbreaks of FCV-VSD (Smith et al., 2008) and were highly efficacious, with treatment resulting in improved survival, reduction in shedding, and a more rapid clinical recovery.",

The duration of compound exposure in this assay was from 1 h prior to infection through to the assay endpoint, thereby allowing the identification of agents acting at any stage of the viral lifecycle.

FCV F9 was chosen for screening due to its well characterised in vitro growth properties, however it is unclear whether FCV F9 used in the current study is representative of currently circulating viruses, due to natural viral evolution of circulating field viruses over the last half century in face of vaccination with F9 based vaccines, or cell culture adaptation, as can occur with high passage number. It is therefore possible that results obtained against FCV F9 may not be representative of efficacy against circulating strains, particularly given the known genetic heterogeneity of FCV (Coyne et al., 2012). Additional antiviral screening was performed against a panel of seven recent FCV isolates from Australia. Variation in susceptibility to antiviral agents can arise rapidly due to viral evolution in response to selection pressures imposed by the use of an antiviral drug in a population, however it may also pre-exist in treatment naive populations. Ferraris et al. (2005) showed significant variability in the sensitivity of influenza A viruses to the neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir, even in viruses isolated prior to the widespread use of these drugs. In contrast, in the current study all tested FCV isolates were susceptible to the inhibitory effects of mefloquine based on the CPE inhibition assay. A concentration\u2013response study demonstrated a greater than two-fold increase in potency for the two field isolates tested compared to the reference virus FCV F9. Although further studies are required to determine whether this is a general feature of field isolates, or whether unique to the two tested isolates, it highlights that consideration must be given to the viral strain used for screening.",

For HCV, combination therapy of ribavirin and interferon has historically been the standard of care, and demonstrated good clinical success (Feld and Hoofnagle, 2005). As rFeIFN-\u03c9 is an approved therapeutic in cats we sought to investigate its use in combination with mefloquine. Interferon monotherapy has previously demonstrated small antiviral effects against FCV in vitro (Mochizuki et al., 1994, Truyen et al., 2002). In vivo efficacy has also been reported in experimental and field studies of FCV (Ninomiya et al. (1991), Uchino et al. (1991) cited in Ohe et al. (2008)). At the concentration used in the current study however, monotherapy with rFeIFN-\u03c9 provided limited protection from CPE which may reflect differences in the sensitivity of virus yield reduction assays compared to CPE inhibition assays (McDonagh et al., 2014) as well as differences in the experimental and infection conditions. Combination therapy with rFeIFN-\u03c9 and mefloquine however demonstrated additive effects, with increasing concentrations of interferon resulting in a reduction in the IC50 of mefloquine. This combination may prove a useful therapeutic option for FCV infections, particularly if it reduces the dose of mefloquine, and a possible concomitant reduction in the risk of adverse reactions.",

The mechanism of action of mefloquine against this diverse group of viruses is not known, nor is it clear whether antiviral efficacy is due to a common broad spectrum mechanism of action. Investigations into the likely mechanism of action of mefloquine against FCV were not conducted in the current study. Given the documented effects of mefloquine on endocytosis, and the morphological changes suggestive of alterations in these pathways in CRFK cells (McDonagh et al., 2014) it is tempting to speculate that the antiviral effects against FCV may arise through perturbation of these pathways. Cellular entry of FCV occurs via receptor mediated endocytosis following binding to the cellular receptor fJAM-A (Stuart and Brown, 2006). Treatment with known inhibitors of different steps of viral entry, including inhibitors of endocytosis, revealed FCV entry involves clathrin coated pits and that endosome acidification was required for infection, in agreement with a previous report by Kreutz and Seal (1995) that showed that chloroquine inhibited viral replication. Under the assay conditions of the current study chloroquine provided no protection against virus induced CPE, suggesting that if viral inhibition was arising through the lysosomotropic effects of mefloquine (Glaumann et al., 1992), this effect is considerably more potent for mefloquine than for chloroquine. Alternatively, a mechanism unrelated to its accumulation in lysosomes, such as an action as an adenosine analogue as hypothesised for JC virus (Brickelmaier et al., 2009), may account for the observed antiviral effects.",

            "text": "Although mefloquine is a human approved pharmaceutical with a significant body of literature regarding its pharmacokinetics and safety, its use in cats has not been reported. It is well recognised that due to deficiencies in a number of drug metabolism pathways, the pharmacokinetics of certain drugs in cats can be quite different to those of other species, a fact which should be considered when extrapolating human pharmacokinetic data to this species (Court, 2013). The IC50 value calculated for the field isolates, based on inhibition of CPE, was approximately 3 \u03bcM which is lower than plasma concentrations of mefloquine reported in human studies (4\u201323 \u03bcM depending on dosing regimens) (Kollaritsch et al., 2000, Simpson et al., 1999). Extrapolating from available data therefore, it may be possible to achieve in vivo concentrations of mefloquine within the therapeutic range; however the potential for cytotoxicity must be considered given the low SI of the compound in CRFK cells.",

This is the first report of the antiviral activity of mefloquine against a calicivirus. Testing against a panel of recent Australian FCV isolates demonstrated the antiviral effects of mefloquine against the reference strain FCV F9 extends to more clinically relevant isolates, and there was no evidence of antagonism when used concurrently with rFeIFN-\u03c9. Further investigation and optimisation of this compound for clinical use in treating the more serious manifestations of FCV infection is warranted. Consideration should be given to investigating the effectiveness of mefloquine against other members of the Caliciviridae of medical or veterinary importance.",
