DESIGN: Rapid antigen testing, viral culture, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for up to 15 viruses in symptomatic residents and chart review. SETTING: A 120-bed LTCF. MEASUREMENTS: Comparison of rapid antigen testing, respiratory viral cultures, and DFA testing and RT-PCR in residents with symptoms of a respiratory tract infection. RESULTS: Twenty-two of 52 residents developed symptoms of a respiratory tract infection between January 29, 2008, and February 26, 2008. RSV was detected using RT-PCR in seven (32%) of the 22 cases. None of the seven cases had positive RSV rapid antigen testing, and only two had positive culture or DFA results. This outbreak occurred during a time when state wide RSV rates were rapidly declining. One patient was admitted to the hospital during the infection and subsequently died. CONCLUSION: RSV may cause outbreaks in LTCFs that traditional diagnostic methods do not detect. RT-PCR can provide a more timely and accurate diagnosis of outbreaks, which allows for early symptomatic treatment, rational use of antibiotics, and improved infection control.

            "text": "R espiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a well-known cause of lower respiratory tract infection in young children, 1 is now increasingly recognized as an important cause of respiratory infection in adults. 2 The clinical effect of RSV may approach that of nonpandemic influenza, a cause of significant morbidity and mortality in adults. 3, 4 Based on national mortality and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention viral surveillance data over a 25-year period , the annual mortality associated with RSV has been estimated at approximately 10,000 deaths per year in adults aged 65 and older. 5 In addition to high-risk individuals with cardiopulmonary disease and immunocompromising conditions, 2,6-10 older adults are increasingly recognized as an at-risk population for RSV infection. RSV infections develop in 4% to 10% of high-risk adults and 3% to 7% of healthy elderly patients annually. 4 The effect in frail elderly people, especially those in long-term care facilities (LTCFs), can be substantial. 9, 11 A review of various studies of RSV infection in LTCFs estimated that 5% to 10% of LTCF residents develop RSV infection annually, of whom 10% to 20% have lower repiratory tract disease. 9 RSV infections lead to an annual average of 15 hospitalizations and 17 deaths per 1,000 persons in LTCF. 12 Although the effect of RSV infection in older adults is substantial, RSV infections are often underdiagnosed in this population for a number of reasons: low clinical suspicion, decreased viral shedding rates in older individuals, poor sensitivity of rapid antigen testing, and delayed results in traditional viral culture or paired serum antibody testing. 7, 9, [13] [14] [15] [16] Until recently, diagnosis of RSV and other respiratory viruses has largely relied on culture and antigen detection using immunofluorescence assays. The sensitivity of these tests is limited, and the diagnosis is often retrospective. 14 Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has recently emerged as a rapid, highly sensitive, highly specific method of detection. 15, 16 The objective of this report is to describe the use of RT-PCR in detecting outbreak of RSV in a LTCF.",

Two veterans were sent to the emergency department, one of whom was admitted to the general medicine service for a presumed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation with possible pneumonia. This patient subsequently developed an acute myocardial infection, resulting in stage IV congestive heart failure. This patient was then placed on hospice care and died 1 month after symptom onset.",

Almost half (42%) of the LTCF residents developed RTI during this outbreak, which occurred toward the end of the RSV season. Thirty-two percent of those who developed RTI were RSV positive, resulting in a RSV infection rate of 13% of total residents. This attack rate is slightly higher than but comparable with the numbers quoted in the literature of 4% to 10% of high-risk adults during each RSV season. 4 Only one case of RTI was attributable to another viral etiology. Moreover, RSV infection was associated with the hospitalizations for pneumonia for two case patients and the death of one case patient, further highlighting the substantial effect of RSV on LTCF residents, most of whom have a number of comorbid diagnoses.",

            "text": "Although RSV has known outbreak potential, higher clinical suspicion and better diagnostic tools are needed. Rapid antigen tests are notoriously insensitive for diagnosis; 19 the rapid antigen tests in all of the RSV case patients were negative. The lack of pathognomonic clinical features also makes diagnosis of RSV based on clinical presentation alone difficult, 20 especially because RSV seasons often overlap with those of other respiratory viruses, such as influenza. 21 Improved molecular diagnostic technology allows for more-rapid and more-precise identification of the pathogen. RT-PCR provides diagnosis within 4 to 6 hours from easily obtained nasal swab samples. In an adult population that usually sheds lower viral titers, RT-PCR has been shown to be 73% sensitive and 99% specific, compared with the traditional criterion standard of viral culture, which was 39% sensitive and 100% specific. 15 RSV is transmitted by close contact through large droplets and fomites. Standard infection-control measures, primarily contact isolation, limit nosocomial spread of RSV infection in elderly people and children. 11 In this outbreak, all case patients used shared areas with no restriction of access or contact isolation. Three case patients continued to attend the facility hemodialysis unit, three continued to undergo physical and occupational therapy in the shared activity room, and four continued to participate in recreational therapy in the recreation room. The ongoing surveillance is performed in real time with DFA and culture only. RT-PCR is not done daily, but as RT-PCR becomes more cost effective, use of this rapid and sensitive diagnostic test will become more widespread, leading to better infection control methods, such as hand washing, contact isolation, and the timely implementation of activity restriction, to limit real-time spread of the infection. In addition, education of staff in infection-control measures and screening staff for viral infections are crucial in further improving infection control. 22 Prompt diagnosis and control of RSV infection can potentially lead to shorter outbreak periods, shorter length of hospital stays, appropriate and targeted antibiotic therapy, and overall lower cost. 23 In one study, LTCF residents were prescribed an average of 2.4 antibiotic courses per year, with more than 8% of infections ultimately attributable to influenza and RSV infection. 12 Antibiotics have consistently been shown to be prescribed in excess during influenza and RSV seasons. The full effect of RSV in LTCF may lead to development and use of better vaccination and prophylactic therapy. 19 It was not possible to collect specimens from the LTCF clinical staff, which limited the ability to understand their role in disease transmission. In addition, successful infection control using RT-PCR requires ongoing surveillance, etiological diagnosis, appropriate infection control infrastructure, and partnership with laboratories with appropriate diagnostic technology.",
