            "text": "Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is widely distributed in cattle-producing areas and countries (Houe, 1999). Clinically severe disease outbreaks associated with acute, uncomplicated BVDV infection have been reported in the US, Britain, Canada, and Germany (Carman et al., 1998). BVDV infection causes various clinical symptoms such as diarrhea, respiratory disorders, and immunosuppression (Thiel et al., 1996). Meanwhile, infection with a highly virulent virus, BVDV-2 could result in prolonged fever, leukopenia, severe thrombocytopenia, and diarrhea (Bolin and Ridpath, 1992; Corapi et al., 1989). In particular, transplacental infection of BVDV in pregnant cows results in reproductive failure such as abortion, mummification or congenital defects according to the gestation stage (Nagai et al., 2001). During the first trimester of gestation the virus infection may produce persistently infected (PI) calves, which are immunotolerant to the infected virus. Thereafter, PI calves maintain significantly a large reservoir, shedding large quantities of the virus in their lifetime, in addition to being a risk group for the mucosal disease (Nettleton and Entrican, 1995; Thiel et al., 1996).",

            "text": "Together with classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and border disease virus (BDV), BVDV belongs to the genus Pestivirus of the family Flaviviridae. The virus genome consists of a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA (approximately 12.5 kb in length), which has one large open reading frame (ORF) coding about 4,000 amino acids (Collett et al., 1988; De Moerlooze et al., 1993; Deng and Brock, 1992) and its polyprotein is proteolytically processed during virus replication to generate viral structural and non-structural proteins (Meyers and Thiel, 1996). Further, the genome contains untranslated regions (UTRs) at both ends (5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs). Pestivirus 5\u2032-UTR includes several short ORFs of unknown function and has been predicted to form a highly structured RNA element that may serve as an internal ribosome entry site to initiate cap-independent translation of ORFs (Brown et al., 1992). The 5\u2032-UTR is particularly attractive for the purpose of viral differentiation because it is highly conserved among members within each pestivirus species (Boye et al., 1991; Berry et al., 1992). On the basis of the 5\u2032-UTRs analysis, BVDV was segregated into two genotypes, BVDV-1 and BVDV-2. Sequence homology within each group was over 93%, while between groups 1 and 2 dropped to 74% (Ridpath et al., 1994). Moreover, BVDV-1 was subdivided into BVDV-1a including reference strain NADL, and BVDV-1b including reference strain Osloss (Pellerin et al., 1994; van Rijn et al., 1997). In general, BVDV was also subdivided into cytopathic BVDV (cpBVDV) and non-cytopathic BVDV (ncpBVDV) biotypes based on cell culture results.",

In this study, primers for BVDV detection were designed on 5\u2032-UTR to determine two BVDV genotypes. The sensitivity of the established RT-PCR was reasonable to detect BVDV from clinical samples. In addition, the specificity of PCR was distinct from other bovine viruses. Because CSFV does not infect cattle and BDV is not present in Korea, these viruses were excluded in the test. Most of the collected samples were aborted fetuses derived from bovine reproductive studies, and the ratio of abortion related to BVDV infection was approximately 6.8%. This result was similar to that of a recent report in Korea (Lee et al., 1999), in which a major cause of 73 abortions or stillbirths determined by pathological findings was neosporosis (21%). The report suggested that BVDV only or co-infection of other viruses and bacteria was 8%. For genotyping the isolates, BVDV-2 specific primer set was designed on the Npro region, with which was appropriate for differential RT-PCR. This study clarified that two genotypes, BVDV-1 and BVDV-2, are present in the Korean cattle population. It was also reported that a Korean isolate of BVDV-2 was a non-cytopathogenic virus. Sequencing efforts were restricted to the four viruses that were able to grow in culture. But, it would have been better to include all 20 positives in this analysis. This would also have helped in determining the relative abundance of type 1 versus type 2 viruses, although this study showed for the first time the existence of type 2 viruses in Korea. It would not be able to discriminate as to whether or not animals are infected with the two types of virus simultaneously. Through direct fluorescent assay, the possibility to be a bovine parvovirus, bovine coronavirus, bovine rotavirus, and bovine adenovirus was excluded.",
