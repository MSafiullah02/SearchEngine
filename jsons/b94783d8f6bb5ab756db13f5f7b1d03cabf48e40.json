Early deaths and long-stay patients (> 72 h) had more severe injuries based on the GCS and neuroimaging characteristics, compared with short-stay patients. Long-stay patients received more monitoring and were treated at higher intensity, and experienced worse 6-month outcome compared to short-stay patients. Between-center variations were prominent in the proportion of short-stay patients (MOR = 2.3, p < 0.001), use of intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring (MOR = 2.5, p < 0.001) and aggressive treatments (MOR = 2.9, p < 0.001); and smaller in 6-month outcome (MOR = 1.2, p = 0.01).",

Patients with severe TBI often receive a highly intensive and multidisciplinary approach to prevent or mitigate both secondary brain injury and systemic complications [2] . For less severe TBI cases (without severe extracranial injury), clinicians have to estimate whether they will benefit from ICU admission, since guidelines with high-level evidence on ICU admission criteria are lacking. ICU admission is costly, and might also potentially be inappropriate for the patient, with risk of overtreatment and ICU-related complications, such as infections from multi-resistant bacteria [3] .",

Recent data suggest that the landscape of TBI in Europe is changing and that, correspondingly, ICU admission policies may have been modified, including a larger proportion of milder TBI patients [4, 5] .",

Around 6% of patients died in the first 3 days after admission, with clearly severe intracranial and extra-cranial injuries. Patients in this group were significantly older, and only approximately half of those with documented intracranial mass lesions in this group received an operation. In survivors, we studied two distinct groups: those with a brief transition through the ICU and the second characterized by a prolonged ICU treatment. We selected the first 72 h as criterion to separate these two patient streams, triggered by the high ICU discharge rate during the first 3 days. This separation identified patients with different clinical characteristics, care pathways, and outcomes: long-stay patients were more severely injured, required more frequent invasive monitoring (including ICP) and therapies (both surgical and medical), and suffered a worse outcome. In contrast, short-stay patients were less severely injured, received less monitoring and treatments, and achieved better outcomes. The most frequently indicated reasons for ICU admission in this latter group were the need for strict neurological observation and mechanical ventilation (which, however, was continued for at least 24 h only in . 3 Six-month Glasgow outcome scale extended. This figure shows the distribution of the functional outcomes at the GOSE after 6 months for all ICU patients, short-stay patients, and long-stay patients a third of cases). This may reflect current policy of early intubation at the scene of accident, and/or during initial assessment and evaluation. Cranial and extra-cranial surgery could also have been alternative indications for a short period of intense post-operative observation in the ICU. These data can be interpreted in one of the two ways. On the one hand, the observed practice may represent a prudent strategy, offering close surveillance and assistance to patients at relatively low risk, but with the opportunity to ensure consistently good outcomes. The risk of deterioration in mild TBI is low but non-negligible. A recent meta-analysis, including 45 studies (for a total of 65,724 patients), estimated a 12% incidence of neurological deterioration and 3.5% neurosurgical intervention in mild TBI (characterized as GCS 13-15) [17] . Alternatively, the observed admission strategies may represent costly over-triage, because the ICU is an expensive resource, which should be used wisely. The fact that 11 patients in the short-stay group were discharged home directly from the ICU raises strong reservations on their need for intensive care. A previous study in mild TBI patients in the ICU in the USA showed that 17% of cases were over-triaged, with over triaged patients defined as \"ICU stay \u2264 1 day; hospital stay \u2264 2 days; no intubation; no neurosurgery; and discharged to home\" [18] . Our data on ICU admission of mild TBI patients are partially concordant with these findings, and while they do not permit accurate costbenefit analysis, they clearly indicate a trend in ICU admission policies that deserves attention.",

This may reflect the small proportion of outcome variance modifiable by differences in management, and/or that differences in individual aspects of management may be discordant and make any outcome impact less easily detectable. Further, between-center variations in outcome that we demonstrated were smaller than previously reported [25, 26] . This may be because previous analyses were based on older data, collected across multiple studies, and heterogeneity in time and location explained the larger outcome variance in these older reports. It is also possible that over time, a more homogeneous standard of treatment has evolved in Europe and Israel.",

Limitations include that we focused on the ICU while an individual patient's fate, and policies of the center at which treatment is delivered, depends on the continuum of care (from pre-hospital to rehabilitation). Second, the centers differed in their ICU characteristics, which might potentially contribute to between-center differences in ICU stay, treatment and outcome. In addition, we might have missed some important case-mix variables in the models that might have contributed to differences between centers (instead of true differences in policies). Third, the low number and non-consecutive enrolment in some centers could result in non-representative recruitment with reference to local ICU admission policy and introduce selection bias. Finally, all centers participating in CENTER TBI are characterized by their commitment to TBI research. They might represent a selected sample of the neuro-trauma centers in Europe limiting generalizability.",
