            "text": "Entamoeba histolytica is responsible for amebiasis, a parasitosis with a worldwide distribution and an elevated mortality rate, possibly the highest after malaria and schistosomiasis. As much as 1% of the world's population is thought to be infected and up to 100,000 related deaths are reported annually (Mandell et al. 2005; Murray et al. 2005; World Health Organization 1997) . The infection is more prevalent among the lower socioeconomic classes in tropical and subtropical climates; other risk factors include immigrants from endemic areas, institutionalized populations (e.g., those with mental retardation), communal living, and promiscuous homosexual males (Ravdin 1988) . The most severe cases are often identified among neonates, during pregnancy and postpartum, corticosteroid use, malignancy, and malnutrition (Ravdin 1988) . Cysts remain viable for long periods of time in the environment after being excreted in the feces of human hosts. Humans can become infected by ingestion of these forms that ultimately become trophozoites in the small bowel, constituting the invasive form of the parasite (Barrett-Connor 1982; Botero 2003; Binford and Connor 1976; Hasleton 1996; Travis et al. 2002; Murray et al. 2002; Fishman 1998) . The majority of cases develop noninvasive infection in keeping with the natural life cycle of Imaging of Parasitic Diseases of the Thorax the parasite; in these patients, trophozoites become encysted and excreted again via the feces into the environment (Mandell et al. 2005) . While invasive disease may develop by direct invasion of the colonic epithelium, the factor that determines pathogenicity remains unknown (Mandell et al. 2005) .",

While \"anchovy sauce\" content can be obtained from an amebic hepatic abscess or from expectorate from a hepatobronchial fistula, the isolation of parasites in these samples is erratic. Cultures can be obtained only in feces, since the protozoan does not grow in pus.

Rarely, invasion of the inferior vena cava occurs, eventually resulting in pulmonary thromboembolism. As in pleural disease, pericarditis and pericardial effusion can result from an inflammatory reaction or drainage of a liver abscess into the pericardium or pleura, usually located in the left hepatic lobe (Figs. 3.6, 3.7) (Le Roux 1969; Shamsuzzaman and Hashiguchi 2002; Ibarra-Perez et al. 1981; Landay et al. 1980 ).",

Children younger than 5 years old, pregnant women and HIV-infected patients are at special risk (Mandell et al. 2005; World Health Organization/Unicef 2005) . Of particular concern is P. falciparum, which is responsible for the majority of cases of severe malaria, causes more than 1 million deaths each year and exhibits an increasing occurrence of resistance to chloroquine and other antimalarial drugs (World Health Organization 2000a). Parasites are inoculated into the human blood by the bite of the Anopheles mosquito. They mature inside the erythrocytes and are released by hemolysis. The process occurs at certain time intervals that coincide with the periodicity of episodic fever (tertian or quartan) (Murray et al. 2005; World Health Organization 1997; Ravdin 1988; Barrett-Connor 1982; Botero 2003; Murray et al. 2002) and it is specific for each species (Murray et al. 2005; Botero 2003; Binford and Connor 1976; Hasleton 1996; Travis et al. 2002; Fishman et al. 1998; Taylor and White 2002) . Thus, malignant tertian fever (P. falciparum) manifests with irregular fever spikes, whereas benign tertian fever (P. vivax, P. ovale) and quartan fever (P. malariae) manifest with fever spikes every 48 and 72 h respectively (Botero 2003) .",

As of 2005, the WHO continued to include ARDS as a criterion for the definition of severe P. falciparum malaria (World Health Organization 2000a). In the setting of malaria, ARDS secondary to P. falciparum is associated with high mortality of 80% (World Health Organization 2000a). Although the pathophysiologic events related to the development of ARDS remain unclear, available data support the fact that pulmonary edema is rather a high permeability edema secondary to microvascular dysfunction (Cosgriff 1990) . Infected erythrocytes sequestrated in the lungs lead to a release of local cytokines that eventually results in pulmonary edema, dyspnea, hypoxic acute lung injury, and ARDS (Mandell et al. 2005; Taylor and White 2002) . Although the majority of cases of ARDS are related to the P. falciparum infection, association with P. vivax and P. ovale is also documented in the literature (Lee and Maguire 1999; Munteis et al. 1997; Tanios et al. 2001; Curlin et al. 1999; Carlini et al. 1999) . Radiographic and CT findings are consistent with ARDS, i.e., pleural effusions, diffuse interstitial edema, and lobar consolidation (Figs. 3.8, 3.9) (Taylor and White 2002; Cosgriff 1990; Lee and Maguire 1999; Munteis et al. 1997; Tanios et al. 2001; Curlin et al. 1999; Carlini et al. 1981; Cayea et al. 1981; Gachot et al. 1995; Torres et al. 1997) .

The infection is acquired through the bite of an insect from the Reduviidae family (genera Triatoma, Rhodnius, and Panstrongylus), by the inoculation of trypomastigotes into the human body. The insect usually defecates near to the bite and the inoculation may occur from rubbing the reduviid bug feces over the bite or some other skin defect (Murray et al. 2005) . The parasites multiply within the macrophages, which eventually rupture, releasing amastigotes capable of invading diverse organs hematogenously, including the heart and the gastrointestinal tract, but namely the esophagus and colon (Botero 2003; Binford and Connor 1976; Hasleton 1996; Travis et al. 2002; Murray et al. 2002; Fishman et al. 1998) .",

Areas of myocardial fibrosis are identified as myocardial delayed enhancement in inversion recovery gradient-echo sequences 10-20 min after the intravenous injection of gadolinium-based contrast ( Fig. 3.13 ). These hyperintense areas, which can be transmural, subendocardial, along the midwall, and subepicardial, are more prone to being identified toward the apex, inferior, and inferolateral walls. Although often indistinguishable from myocardial fibrosis due to coronary artery disease, the finding could be a helpful marker of disease severity among seropositive patients, especially those who are asymptomatic (Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance 2003; Mahrholdt et al. 2005; Rochitte et al. 2005 ).

Human infection is thought to be present in one-fourth of the world's population (World Health Organization 2002) with an estimated mortality between 20,000 and 60,000 per year (Mandell et al. 2005; Sarinas and Chitkara 1997) , primarily as a consequence of intestinal obstruction (Sarinas and . The parasite has worldwide distribution; however, tropical and subtropical climates in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Central/South America account for the majority of people infected . Under certain unusual circumstances, Ascaris suum, a large roundworm endemic to pigs, can infect humans (see visceral larva migrans) (Maruyama et al. 1996; Sakakibara et al. 2002) . The parasite is acquired by ingestion of embryonated eggs, usually present in contaminated foods or fluids (Fishman 1998) . For completing their natural cycle, parasitic larvae migrate from the small intestine to the pulmonary arterial circulation 4 days after the ingestion of the eggs (Mandell et al. 2005) . After 6-10 days of growing, larvae break into the alveoli and eventually are ingested; once in the intestine and after 2 months, mature worms produce eggs that are excreted in human feces, completing the cycle. Larvae in the lungs produce an inflammatory reaction with destruction of capillaries and alveolar walls, subsequent edema, hemorrhage, and epithelial cell desquamation, causing chemotaxis of neutrophils and eosinophils (Botero 2003; Binford and Connor 1976; Hasleton 1996; Travis et al. 2002; Murray et al. 2002; Fishman et al. 1998) .",

Asthma has also been described in the setting of ascariasis (Cromp-ton 2001) . Eosinophils and Charcot-Leyden crystals are often identified in the sputum . Confirmation requires identification of larvae in the sputum or gastric aspirates (Murray et al. 2005; Fishman 1998; Proffitt and Walton 1962) . In patients from non-endemic areas who present with pulmonary symptoms, the diagnosis is suggested when eggs are present in the stool (Botero 2003; Zumba and James 2002) .",

Although reports on the global prevalence of the disease are highly dissimilar (ranging from 1 to 100 million people worldwide), it appears clear that strongyloidiasis is not as frequent as infection with other nematodes (e.g., Ascaris lumbricoides or Trichuris trichiura) (Mandell et al. 2005; Murray et al. 2002) . The parasite is found in all tropical and subtropical regions (Mandell et al. 2005; Murray et al. 2002) . Infective filariform larvae are capable of invading the skin from the contaminated soil (Murray et al. 2005) . Larvae migrate hematogenously to the lungs where they mature and are eventually coughed up and swallowed. In the small intestine adults produce eggs, which generate rhabditiform larvae that can be either excreted into the environment in human feces, completing the cycle, or become filariform larvae (Murray et al. 2005; Barrett-Connor 1982; Botero 2003; Binford and Connor 1976; Travis et al. 2002; Murray et al. 2002; Fishman 1998) capable of autoinfection to perpetuate the cycle. This chronic pathway of continuous autoinfection can lead to a massive and life-threatening parasitic infestation (the so-called hyperinfection syndrome), especially in AIDS patients and in patients who are receiving glucocorticoid therapy (Chu et al. 1990 ). Hyperinfection syndrome is associated with a mortality rate close to 100% without treatment and perhaps higher than 25% when treated (Mandell et al. 2005) .",

Hookworms share several characteristics with A. lumbricoides including worldwide distribution, especially in the tropical and subtropical regions, and the necessity of a maturation phase in the lungs. The infection is thought to occur in about 25% of the world's population (Murray et al. 2005; Sarinas and Chitkara 1997; Hotez and Pritchard 1995) . As opposed to ascariasis, hookworm infection is acquired by the percutaneous penetration of larvae from the soil. Parasites migrate to the lungs where they ultimately penetrate the alveolar walls, ascend through the trachea and eventually are swallowed up into the small intestine (Mandell et al. 2005) . Pulmonary disease is related to the migration of parasites to the lungs, which causes eosinophilic pleural effu-sion (Yassin et al. 2007) or transient pneumonitis (Loeffler's-like syndrome), pathophysiologically and clinically similar to ascariasis , though less frequent and severe (Mandell et al. 2005) . Peripheral blood eosinophilia is common . Radiographic manifestations are thought to be similar to those of ascariasis ; however, there are not enough data available in the radiologic literature. Diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating the parasite in respiratory, gastric or duodenal secretions . The presence of eggs is not helpful during pulmonary disease, since this event is expected to occur 2 months after the dermal penetration , i.e., after the parasite's pulmonary phase (Mandell et al. 2005 ).",

In all three species, the infection is usually acquired by ingestion of contaminated products (Mandell et al. 2005; Chitkara and Sarinas 1997; Phills et al. 1972) . Once in the intestinal mucosa, larvae can migrate to a variety of organs including lymphatics, liver, lungs, and less frequently the heart, central nervous system, eye, and other organs . T. canis and T. catis have worldwide distribution wherever dogs and cats, respectively, are present (Murray et al. 2005) . Children are at higher risk due to pica, proximity with pets, and outdoor play . Infection with A. suum was reproduced experimentally in humans in the 1970s (Phills et al. 1972) ; however, outbreaks have been described in Japan since then (Maruyama et al. 1996; Sakakibara et al. 2002; Sakai et al. 2006 ). Larvae of these species are unable to grow into mature adults in humans and thus eggs or worms are not detected in feces (Sakai et al. 2006) . VLM due to T. canis and T. catis can cause pulmonary disease in 25-85%. Clinical manifestations include mild forms with coughing and wheezing, severe bronchiolitis, asthma, and acute/chronic eosinophilic pneumonia with respiratory failure Bartelink et al. 1993; Inoue et al. 2002) , usually with associated peripheral blood eosinophilia (Fishman 1998; Chitkara and Sarinas 1997) . The pulmonary migration of A. suum triggers an inflammatory reaction similar to that elicited by A. lumbricoides (Phills et al. 1972) . Clinical forms of infection with A. suum are similar to other presentations of VLM (Sakai et al. 2006; Phills et al. 1972) . Diagnosis of VLM is achieved by the detection of antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Sakai et al. 2006; Chitkara and Sarinas 1997) . Larvae of A. suum can be isolated in respiratory secretions and gastric aspirates during the pulmonary phase (Phills et al. 1972) .",

Isolated case reports have shown other characteristics like mediastinal and retroperitoneal adenopathy evident on the CT scan (Wolach et al. 1995) . In adults, radiographic manifestations include scattered bilateral reticular or heterogeneous opacities that can be migratory Bartelink et al. 1993 ) and less commonly, nodules and segmental consolidations that can resolve within days Inoue et al. 2002; Feldman and Parker 1992; Sane and Barber 1997) . Bacterial superimposed infection has been documented in immunosuppressed patients (Kremery et al. 1992 ). Limited information is available regarding CT findings (Fig. 3.24) . Isolated case reports in adults demonstrated peripheral alveolar and ground-glass opacities (Inoue et al. 2002) and small ill-defined ground-glass and solid nodules (Sane and Barber 1997; Roig et al. 1992) . Radiologic characteristics of infection due to A. suum appear to be similar to other forms of VLM, including bilateral reticulonodular opacities on chest radiographs and bilateral nodules with halo or ill-defined ground-glass opacities on CT scans, which may be associated with multiple low attenuation lesions in the liver (Maruyama et al. 1996; Sakakibara et al. 2002; Sakai et al. 2006 ).",

The disease has been sporadically reported worldwide, with many cases emanating from the East Coast and South of the United States (Mandell et al. 2005; Asimacopoulos et al. 1992) . It is caused by Dirofilaria immitis, a filarial nematode that is transmitted from dogs to humans by mosquitoes. An immature adult worm, unable to mature in the accidental human host, can reach a peripheral vein and travel in the bloodstream until it lodges in the arterial pulmonary circulation where it dies, causing local vasculitis and eventually an infarct (Mandell et al. 2005; Botero 2003; Murray et al. 2002) . The infection is frequently asymptomatic and becomes evident due to the incidental detection of a solitary pulmonary nodule (Mandell et al. 2005; Murray et al. 2005; Fishman 1998 ). Patients can sometimes present with coughing, pain, and hemoptysis, most likely due to pulmonary infarct (Mandell et al. 2005; Fishman 1998 ). Eosinophilia is present in less than 15% of cases (Mandell et al. 2005) .",

Peripheral blood eosinophilia and elevated serum IgE levels are present. Radiographically, reticulonodular infiltrates or a miliary pattern are seen on chest radiographs.

(Courtesy of Dr. Fortunato Juarez, INER, Mexico DF, Mexico) thoracic duct in the chest and diffuse lymphangiectasia in the abdomen and pelvis were reported by Ahn et al.

Diagnosis is confirmed by identification of microfilaria in lymph nodes or pulmonary nodules, and by specific serology tests. However, often microfilariae cannot be identified on microscopic examination; then a favorable response to treatment with diethylcarbamazine is diagnostic (Kuznen 2006; Lahiri 1993 ).",

            "text": "Unilocular cystic echinococcosis is caused by E. granulosus. Overall, the liver is the most commonly affected organ; however, thoracic disease is a very common presentation among adults (Beggs 1985; Bonakdarpour 1967; Polat et al. 2003 ) and perhaps the most common among children (Slim et al. 1971; Bloomfield 1980) . Diverse organs in the chest can be affected by the disease either by growing cysts from the liver that traverse the diaphragm or by hematogenous spread (Gottstein and Reichen 2002) . Although the lungs are affected in most cases of thoracic hydatid disease, other thoracic organs can be affected (pleural fissures, parietal pleura, chest wall, mediastinum, diaphragm and heart) (Kilic et al. 2006; Oguzkaya et al. 1997; Qian 1988) . Pulmonary hydatid disease can remain asymptomatic for long periods of time (months to years) or manifest with diverse symptoms including coughing, hemoptysis, bilioptysis, pneumothorax, pleuritis, lung abscess, parasitic pulmonary embolism, anaphylaxis secondary to cyst rupture, or cyst superinfection (Gottstein and Reichen 2002; Polat et al. 2003 Eosinophilia is present in less than 15% of cases and generally occurs in the setting of leakage of antigenic material, i.e., cyst rupture. Although a variety of serologic studies are available, high false-negative and falsepositive results have been described (Morar and Feldman 2003) . Indirect hemagglutination and ELISA tests in association with abdominal ultrasonography can be used as screening tests in high-risk populations (Gottstein and Reichen 2002; Shambesh et al. 1999; MacPherson et al. 1987) . Definitive diagnosis relies on the histopathology (Gottstein and Reichen 2002) . Radiographic and CT findings demonstrate cystic lesions, which can be solitary (60% of cases) or multiple (Fig. 3.27) , unilateral or bilateral (20-50%). Lesions are predominantly identified in the lower lobes (60%) and can exhibit diameters between 1 and 20 cm. The coexistence of liver and lung disease is present in only 6% of patients (Polat et al. 2003) . Uncomplicated cysts, the most common presentation (Saksouk et al. 1986 ), may be seen as round or oval masses that have well-defined borders (Fig. 3.28) , do not enhance after contrast material injection, whilst the pericyst enhances if infected, and have a hypoattenuating content relative to the cap-sule. On MRI, the cyst content appears characteristically hypointense on T1-and hyperintense on T2-weighted images with a well-defined wall that is isointense and hypointense respectively (Von Sinner et al. 1990 . The development of daughter cysts inside the mother cyst is an early sign of degeneration. On MRI the contents of the mother cyst tend to be more intense with hypointense, viable daughter cysts on T1-and both the mother and the daughter cysts are isointense on T2-weighted images (Von Sinner et al. 1990 . The \"meniscus sign\" or \"crescent sign, \" which is characterized by the presence of air between the pericyst and the laminated membrane, appears as growth continues and the cysts erode adjacent bronchioles (Figs. 3.29, 3.30) . It is considered to be a sign of impending rupture. Cystic rupture may result in different radiologic signs. The \"double arch, \" \"cumbo sign, \" or \"onion peel sign, \" defined as the presence of the meniscus sign and an air-fluid level within the endocyst. The \"water lily sign\" represents an endocyst floating in a partially fluid-filled cyst (Fig. 3.31) , whereas an endocyst floating in a cyst with no fluid is recognized as the \"mass within the cavity\" appearance (Beggs 1985; Bonakdarpour 1967; Polat et al. 2003; Pedrosa et al. 2000; Balikian and Mudarris 1974) . Rupture can be associated with consolidation adjacent to the cyst (Saksouk et al. 1986 ). Atypical manifestations of cysts are less frequent, but have certainly been described (Koul et al. 2000) . Radiographic and CT findings in transdiaphragmatic dissemination (Fig. 3 .32) include pleural effusion, hemidiaphragm elevation, pulmonary consolidation, laminar basal atelectasis, pleural cysts, hydropneumothorax, bronchobiliary fistula and empyema (Balikian and Mudarris 1974; Koul et al. 2000; Bhatia 1997; Gouliamos et al. 1991; Ramos Fig. 3 .27 Multiple hydatid cysts. a PA chest radiograph showed two welldefined pulmonary round opacities (arrows) in the left lung simulating pulmonary nodules. b CT scan of the chest confirmed the cystic nature of the lesions, which demonstrated a low attenuating value of -9 HU compatible with fluid density. c PA chest radiograph showing innumerable widespread opacities in both lung fields compatible with pulmonary hydatidosis, simulating cannon ball pulmonary metastases Von Sinner 1990a; Kurkcuoglu et al. 2002a; Kabiri et al. 2001; Sahin et al. 2006; Nadir et al. 2005) . Pulmonary cysts do not or very rarely calcify (Bonakdarpour 1967; Polat et al. 2003) . Similar radiologic findings have been reported in other intrathoracic extrapulmonary cysts, e.g., mediastinum, pericardium, hila, chest wall (Nadir et al. 2005; Cantoni et al. 1993; Dahniya et al. 2001; Marcos et al. 1969; Ozdemir et al. 1994; Tuzun and Hekimoglu 2001) , cardiovascular system ( Fig. 3.33 ) (Cantoni et al. 1993; Miralles et al. 1994; Malouf et al. 1985; Tercan et al. 2005; Odev et al. 2002; Franquet et al. 1999) . In contrast to pulmonary hydatid cysts, mediastinal hydatid cysts do calcify at the periphery, i.e., they show pericystic calcifications (Fig. 3.33) (Zidi et al. 2006) . In some patients with cardiac hydatid disease, cyst rupture may occur, leading to hydatid embolism to the pulmonary arteries (Fig. 3.34) , or to the brain, causing a stroke.",

It is prevalent in Central Europe, Russia, western China, northern Japan, North America, particularly Alaska and Canada, and North Africa (Morar and Feldman 2003) . Intermediate hosts include foxes and small rodents. Definitive hosts are dogs and cats. Humans become infected by accidentally ingesting the eggs of the tapeworm, excreted by the final hosts or during normal feeding by a variety of rodents and small lagomorphs (Vuitton et al. 2003) . The infection behaves like a malignant liver tumor, invading and metastasizing to the brain, lungs and other organs (Mandell et al. 2005; Morar and Feldman 2003) . If left untreated, virtually 100% of patients will ultimately die within 15 years (Morar and Feldman 2003; Wilson et al. 1995; Ammann and Eckert 1996) . Clinical manifestations include fatigue, weight loss, coughing, and hemoptysis. According to the European Echinococcosis Registry, thoracic compromise, very often associated with liver disease, occurs by direct extension to the diaphragm, lungs, and pleura (12% of all cases) or metastatic spread to the lungs (~6% of all cases) (Ammann and Eckert 1996; Akinoglu et al. 1991; Kern et al. 2003) . Metastasis to the right atrium (Etievent et al. 1986 ) and thoracic spine have also been described . Definitive diagnosis can be achieved by immunohistochemical and histological analysis. Serologic tests, also available, are important in the early detection of asymptomatic cases (Gottstein and Reichen 2002) .",

Variable changes in the right lung base occur when a liver mass invades the diaphragm and extends into the chest, including pleural effusion, empyema, and right lower lobe parenchymal nodules or masses due to cysts (Treugut et al. 1980) . Bronchobiliary fistula is a complication of direct extension. It can be suspected on CT examination by the coexistence of a liver mass extending through the diaphragm with clustered calcifications and air, and associated continuity with air bronchograms in the right lower lobe. The fistulous tracts can be identified on MR cholangiographic sequences. The diagnosis can be confirmed by demonstrating passage of the radiotracer or contrast material to the tracheobronchial tree on a Tc-HIDA hepatobiliary scintigraphy scan or endoscopic retrograde cholangiography respectively (Senturk et al. 1998) .",

One hundred and twenty million are symptomatic and 20 million have severe disease. Although the infection is endemic in more than 70 countries in all continents, 85% of affected patients live in Africa where Angola, the Central African Republic, Chad, Tunisia, Egypt, Morocco, Ghana, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan, the United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia, Mali, Uganda, and Zimbabwe seem to be the most commonly affected areas. Other affected countries include the Caribbean islands, Japan, Mauritius, Brazil, Cambodia, China, Laos, the Philippines, Botswana, Iran, and Iraq. Although progress has been achieved regarding control of schistosomiasis in the last 2 years, the infection continues to be a devastating and disabling disease, only surpassed by malaria. Mortality is calculated to be near 300,000 deaths per year (Chitsulo et al. 2000; World Health Organization 2006) . There are three important Schistosoma species: S. hematobium, S. mansoni, and S. japonicum. Although all three species can cause pulmonary disease (Morris and Knauer 1997) , S. mansoni and S. japonicum are those most frequently observed (Nash et al. 1982) . S. mansoni is endemic to Africa, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Sudan, Madagascar, Brazil, Surinam, Venezuela, and Puerto Rico, whereas S. japonicum is more frequently seen in East Asia. Infection is acquired through exposure of the skin to water contaminated with cercariae excreted by snails. This parasitic form has the ability to penetrate the skin or the intestinal wall, migrate to the lung and ultimately the liver, where it continues its life cycle (Murray et al. 2005; Botero 2003; Morris and Knauer 1997) .",

Clinical manifestations often include shortness of breath, wheezing, and dry coughing. The diagnosis is suggested in patients who live in or have traveled to endemic areas and who present with eosinophilia (Morris and Knauer 1997) . Patients may have both clinical and radiologic manifestations after the onset of treatment. Katayama fever, more commonly described with S. mansoni and S. japonicum, Fig. 3 .40 Cysticercosis. Plain radiograph of the chest showing calcified cysticerci of the chest wall and neck muscles refers to pulmonary symptoms that coincide with febrile illness, and is thought to represent an immunologic reaction to the parasite's eggs. Associated symptoms include urticaria, arthralgia, hepatosplenomegaly, hepatitis, eosinophilia, and pulmonary disease. The acute infection is more commonly seen in individuals traveling to endemic regions (Morris and Knauer 1997) . Chest radiograph can be normal (Lambertucci et al. 1997 (Lambertucci et al. , 2005 or show multiple, bilateral, ill-defined, nodular opacities (Lambertucci et al. 1997; Nguyen et al. 2006; Waldman et al. 2001; Cooke et al. 1999; Schwartz 2002; Schwartz et al. 2000) and less frequently, consolidation (Lambertucci et al. 1997; Fatureto et al. 2003) or reticulonodular opacities (Schwartz 2002) . These abnormalities are usually transitory and resolve within weeks (Cooke et al. 1999) . CT scanning can show solitary (Fatureto et al. 2003) or multiple subpleural soft tissue nodules that may exhibit surrounding ground-glass opacities (the so-called \"halo\" sign) (Fig. 3.41 ). Sensitivity is low for the examination of stool and urine for eggs at this stage of infection, although rectal biopsy may help improve the diagnosis. ELISA is a better initial study, but positive results must be confirmed with enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot. Because serologic tests remain positive for years, even after treatment, they are not helpful for the diagnosis of reinfection or for determining the success of treatment (Schwartz 2002; Schwartz et al. 2000) .",

Ultimately, eggs can shunt from the portal system and reach the arterial pulmonary circulation (Schwartz 2002; Andrade and Andrade 1970) . Early pulmonary schistosomiasis. Axial CT scan of the chest shows multiple peripheral subpleural pulmonary nodules surrounded by a halo of ground-glass opacity or attenuation in the lower lobes bilaterally. S. mansoni was the proven etiologic factor (Reproduced with permission from Radiographics, Martinez et al. 2005) A granulomatous reaction to eggs deposited in the pulmonary vasculature leads to intimal fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, and cor pulmonale. The clinical picture includes dyspnea, chest pain, fatigue, palpitations, coughing, and finally right-sided heart failure. Radiographic and CT findings (Fig. 3 .42) include right ventricular enlargement, pulmonary hypertension, dilatation of the azygous vein (due to abundant collaterals draining a hypertensive portal system), and scattered calcified nodules i.e., granulomatas throughout the lungs (Phillips et al. 1975; Pagan Saez 1985) . Atypical presentation simulating tuberculosis and neoplasm has been described (El Mallah and Hashem 1953; Schaberg et al. 1991; Tizes et al. 1967) . Diagnosis is made by identifying eggs in stool or urine samples or by rectal biopsy; sometimes lung biopsy has been proved effective. Serologic tests are not very helpful because they cannot help differentiate between a former infection and current disease (Richert and Krakaur 1959; Schwartz 2002; Schwartz et al. 2000; Phillips et al. 1975 ).",

Alternatively, undercooked meat of infected pigs and wild boars are also sources (Nakamura-Uchiyama et al. 2002) . The infection is endemic in areas of East Asia, Southeast Asia, Latin America (primarily Peru), and Africa (primarily Nigeria) ( Barrett-Connor 1982; Botero 2003; Binford and Connor 1976; Hasleton 1996; Travis et al. 2002; Murray et al. 2002; Fishman et al. 1998 ). Many cases have been reported in the United States among Indo-Chinese and Latin American immigrants (Nakamura-Uchiyama et al. 2002; Johnson and Johnson 1983; Velez et al. 2002) . It is believed that 195 million people are at risk, and 20.7 million are infected in endemic areas (Murray et al. 2002) . After ingestion, the infective larvae of P. westermani penetrate the duodenum and migrate to the peritoneal cavity and abdominal wall. Ultimately, parasitic forms travel through the diaphragm to the pleura and lungs (Velez et al. 2002) . Although paragonimiasis affects primarily the lungs, skin and central nervous system compromise is also well described. Patients present with fever, chest pain, and respiratory symptoms such as chronic coughing and hemoptysis. Peripheral blood eosinophilia is present in more than 80% of patients (Nakamura-Uchiyama et al. 2002) . Diagnosis is confirmed by detecting parasite eggs in the sputum, pleural fluid, or feces; in addition, larvae can often be found at bronchial brushing and washing. Intradermal and serologic tests are also available (Nakamura-Uchiyama et al. 2002) .",

            "text": "Radiologic findings correlate well with the stage of the disease. The penetration of juvenile worms through the diaphragm into the pleural cavity can cause pleural effusion, pneumothorax ( Fig. 3 .43) and potentially empyema. Migration of worms through the lungs usually manifests as consolidation (Fig. 3.44 ). Band-like opacities extending from the pleural surface can be identified at this stage, usually representing worm migration tracts (Fig. 3.45) . As parasites grow, they tend to settle down. At this time, consolidation resolves and thin-walled cysts appear. When cysts are fluid-filled they manifest on the chest radiograph as round soft tissue nodules (Fig. 3.46) , 0.5 to 4 cm in diameter. CT can better identify cysts, even when they are smaller (i.e., 5-15 mm in diameter) (Fig. 3.46 ) or in the presence of surrounding consolidation due to their hypodense content. If bronchial communication develops, air inside the cyst is better demonstrated on both the plain radiograph and CT (Fig. 3.47) . A characteristic appearance at this stage is the ring shadow, which is characterized by a thin-walled cavity with a crescent-shaped opacity inside representing the parasite, usually less than 3 mm thick, and a crescent-shaped area of increased opacity or hyperattenuation within the cyst that represents worms attached to the wall (Fig. 3 .48) (Nakamura-Uchiyama et al. 2002; Johnson and Johnson 1983; Velez et al. 2002; Im et al. 1992 Im et al. , 1993 Im et al. , 1997 Mukae et al. 2001; Sharma 1989 ). Loeffler's-like syndrome with transitory and/or migratory consolidative or ground-glass opacities has also been described (Bahk 1962; Suwanik and Harinsuta 1959) . During and after treatment, fibronodular changes can develop in areas previously affected. Calcifications can be present; however, their presence should raise the question of possible coexistent tuberculosis. Fibrosis and cicatricial emphysema, frequent in tuberculosis, are virtually absent in paragonimiasis (Im et al. 1993 (Im et al. , 1997 .",

Thoracic paragonimiasis presenting as a solitary pulmonary nodule. a PA chest radiograph, cone view, shows an ill-defined opacity (arrow) in the right middle lobe. b Axial CT scan of the chest, close-up image, shows to better advantage a round soft tissue nodule (arrow) in the right middle lobe.

(Reproduced with permission from Radiographics, Martinez et al. 2005) nary infiltrates, the so-called pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia (PIE), a term coined in 1952 which covers a wide spectrum of diseases. It is therefore important to differentiate between parasitic and nonparasitic causes of PIE. Parasitic EP occurs in almost all metazoan helminthic infections during larval migration of the parasite through the lungs, producing VLM, so-called Loeffler's syndrome described in 1932, and presumably caused by the Ascaris larvae. In patients who have not lived in tropical or subtropical regions Toxocara and Ascaris species should be considered, while for patients who have lived in tropical or subtropical regions Paragonimus species, Strongyloides species, Ancylostoma species, Schistosoma species, Necator americanus, Wuchereria bancrofti, and Brugia malayi should be taken into consideration. Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia (TPE) caused by filarial worms W. bancrofti and B. malayi is the most serious parasitic eosinophilic lung disease, in which cases have typically been reported to masquerade as acute or refractory bronchial asthma. Eosinophils are recruited to the lung to kill the parasite. Despite larval migration through the lungs, there is usually no permanent lung damage (Chitkara and Krishna 2006) . Patients present with respiratory symptoms with or without fever. Chest radiographs and CT scans of the chest show migratory peripheral pulmonary infiltrates or consolidation or ground-glass opacities. Blood eosinophilia may or may not be present. The diagnosis is confirmed by the identification of eggs or larvae",
