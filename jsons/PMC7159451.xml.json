It is approved by the Food and Drug Agency as a biomarker for sepsis and has been found to be a useful prognostic biomarker in febrile neutropenic patients with documented infections.1, 2 Infectious complications are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in febrile neutropenic patients after ASCT. Fever is, therefore, frequently treated with antibiotics. However, unnecessary use of broad\u2010spectrum antibiotic treatment harbors the risk of evolution of drug resistant bacteria and Clostridium difficile infection.",

These patients also incurred an average additional cost of $9825/patient/day. Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) are most at risk for the development of ES following ASCT. Up to 30% of these patients developed the complication and the high incidence has been attributed to the prior use of bortezomib and lenalidomide.4 Due to associated hypogammaglobulinemia, MM patients are also at increased risk for infections. The ability to differentiate between fever from bacterial infection and fever from ES in MM patients is, therefore, greatly needed. Here, we set out to evaluate the utility of PCT as a biomarker to differentiate between bacterial infection and ES in MM patients following ASCT.",

Symptom onset of ES occurred up to 2 days prior to 3 days following beginning neutrophil recovery, between the 6th to the 10th day post transplantation. Fever lasted 1\u201010 days (median 5). Work up for bacterial infection was negative in all but one patient at the time of engraftment. One patient had Escherichia coli bacteremia. No other bacterial infections were observed following engraftment until hospital discharge. While CRP levels were elevated in all patients (median 8.5; range 1.4\u201017; norm 0.0\u20100.5 mg/dL), PCT was elevated in the bacteremia patient only (6.39 ng/mL) and remained <2 ng/mL (median 0.48; range 0.10\u20101.97) in all other observations.",
