            "text": "As wild cheetah populations continue to decline, captive populations in zoological institutions, breeding and conservation centers grow in importance. Though similar in many aspects to other species in the felid family, cheetahs exhibit unique adaptations that can make their captive care more challenging. They are more susceptible to stress induced diseases than other species (Chapter 25), and in particular captive cheetahs appear to be more susceptible to infectious diseases, some of which was initially attributed to their lack of genetic variability (Heeney et al., 1990, Munson et al., 2005, O\u2019Brien et al., 1985; Chapters 6 and 25625). Management requires a comprehensive program to maintain a healthy population of captive cheetahs, including veterinary care, nutrition, housing, exercise, and enrichment. Initial information can be found through the cheetah Animal Care Manual. The manual, published by the cheetah Species Survival Plan\u00ae (SSP) and the North American captive cheetah specialists, provides general guidelines for the care of cheetahs, and has been shared with the international cheetah community. These guidelines may need to be adjusted based on each institution\u2019s local and regional needs. This chapter covers the aspects of housing, stress management, restraint/handling, anesthesia, preventative medicine (including vaccination, health examinations, preshipment and quarantine examinations, and diagnostics), necropsy, and cub care. Protocols and forms that are relevant to this chapter can be found at https://www.elsevier.com/books-and-journals/book-companion/9780128040881.",

Because cheetahs exhibit a high degree of mate selection (Chapters 9 and 27927), facilities need to be able to hold a large number of potential breeding animals (four to six females and at least two groups of males) and be subdivided into multiple interconnected enclosures, to increase the chances of reproductive success (Bertschinger et al., 2008, Wielebnowski et al., 2002, Ziegler-Meeks, 2009). Cheetahs used for breeding purposes are currently not recommended to be used concurrently as educational program animals (ambassador cats). The SSP guidelines recommend that all males be maintained in their natural sibling coalitions to improve reproductive success, as well as maintain strong, healthy coalition bonds. Alternatively, captive male cheetahs can be successfully introduced at a young age, to form stable coalitions that simulate natural social groupings of wild male cheetahs (Chadwick et al., 2013; Chapter 27). Koester et al. (2015) reported improved testis function and more normal, motile spermatozoa and androgen production in males held in coalitions compared to those held singly.",

Many factors, including exhibit design, animal movements, exercise, and enrichment, need to be addressed to minimize stress. Cheetah exhibits should be located far from potential sources of stress, such as other large carnivores (e.g., lions, hyenas), and should be designed to encourage natural behavior. Limiting the need for animal handling, particularly during breeding situations, decreases acute stresses. Exercise is crucial for cheetahs, and should be facilitated through sufficient enclosure size, as well as a lure course system within the enclosure. Mechanical lure coursing equipment pulls a lure (such as a rag, feathers, or meat treat) quickly (80 kph) around the area. The running provides enrichment and health opportunities for the animals. Other enrichment opportunities, such as providing meat on the bone or carcasses (Chapter 26), novel scents and \u2018safe\u2019 toys, and climbing structures, should be provided for the well-being of the cheetah.",

Frequency is determined based on the patient and anesthetic protocol, but ideally should be recorded minimally every 5 min. An anesthetized cheetah\u2019s heart rate and respiratory rate can vary depending on the anesthetic drug combination used. Lower heart rates are seen with \u03b12 agonists, such as medetomidine and dexmedetomidine. Lower respiratory rates are observed with respiratory depressant anesthetics, such as butorphanol and propofol. Body temperature should be monitored closely. If hyperthermia (>40\u00b0C/104\u00b0F) is present, the body should be cooled down in a controlled manner to prevent a rapid drop of body temperature. Hypothermia (<37\u00b0C/98\u00b0F) should be addressed aggressively to prevent hemodynamic changes. Both direct and indirect blood pressure monitoring during anesthesia have been performed in the cheetah (Sadler et al., 2013, Sant Cassia et al., 2015), and measurement of blood pressure is recommended as part of overall anesthesia monitoring. Intravenous or subcutaneous fluids should be provided throughout the anesthesia.",

Similarly, given the propensity for a wide variety of hepatic, gastric, and renal diseases, special attention should be given to those organ systems (Chapter 25). The oral cavity should be evaluated for lesions, such as papillomatous plaques under the tongue or oral ulcerations. A thorough dental examination should be conducted. Crowding of incisors and palatal depressions are common in captive and wild cheetahs (Marker and Dickman, 2004, Steenkamp et al., 2017; Chapter 7). Palatal depressions can become pathological (focal palatine erosion, FPE; Chapter 25); these crypts can get impacted and infected, leading to abscessations and oronasal fistulas. Gently removing the points from the mandibular M1 (using a Dremel or similar tool) prevents further trauma to the crypts. Tooth abrasions and fractures, particularly those of the canine teeth, are commonly found on oral examination in captive cheetahs (Steenkamp and Boy, 2009). Resorptive lesions have also been documented in both captive and wild Namibian cheetah skulls (Roux et al., 2009).",

The use of urine protein-creatinine ratio can be useful for the confirmation of proteinuria. Serum symmetric dimethylarginine, a renal biomarker, can also be used to detect early renal disease. This test appears to be promising, however to date there are no reference values for non-domestic felids, including cheetahs. Newer research into renal biomarkers are being conducted in several exotic felids and can potentially be applied to cheetahs. Serum and acute phase proteins are being used to detect early stages of inflammation, secondary to gastrointestinal and renal diseases. Baseline serum and acute phase proteins are described in captive cheetahs (Depauw et al., 2012).

Prior to the birth of the cubs, a hand-rearing protocol should be in place along with equipment and supplies, in case they are needed. Every effort should be made to allow the dam to rear the cubs on her own. However, if illness, maternal neglect, abandonment, or trauma occurs, or if only 1 cub is born, a decision to hand-rear has to be made rapidly. Fostering should always be done for single cubs (when another litter is available) as the single cub does not stimulate the dam enough for adequate milk production.

If failure of passive transfer is present, a plasma transfusion from the dam or another cheetah may be needed. Plasma can be given to the cubs subcutaneously or by mouth for the first 1\u20132 weeks to ensure that full amount is received.

To prevent exposure to infectious diseases, hand-rearing should be performed in an isolated room and proper personal protective equipment, such as gloves, gowns, masks, and boots, should be worn. Deworming with pyrantel pamoate should begin at 6 weeks and be administered every 2 weeks until cubs are 16 weeks of age.

(2009) reported that the average growth rate in a healthy hand-reared cheetah cub averaged 48 g/day. Those that did not survive averaged much lower daily gains (\u223c5 g/day). Mean growth rate was affected by the type of first solid food given, with ground beef having the lowest growth rate. Cheetah milk is lower in carbohydrates than domestic cat milk and milk replacers; therefore Lombardi et al. (2009) recommends diluting commercial milk formula with distilled water to help decrease carbohydrate load and diminish frequency of diarrhea. Formulas, such as Kitten Milk Replacer (KMR) have been used successfully, mixed either at a 1:2 or 1:3 ratio, and lead to higher survival rates than dog formulas (Esbilac; Lombardi et al., 2009). Zoologic formulas 42/52, 33/40, and 30/55 contain less carbohydrates compared to KMR, and are less frequently associated with diarrhea. Different institutions have added supplemental vitamins, protein sources, or have combined milk replacers to bring the milk composition closer to natural cheetah milk, the constituents of which have been well documented (Lombardi et al., 2009). It is recommended for the first feedings to consist of 5% dextrose mixed with distilled water or pedialyte, and then introduce the formula gradually once cubs are stable and taking several feedings well. Frequency of bottle-feeding depends on the cub\u2019s age, and is gradually decreased from every 2 h for newborns to approximately six feedings per day by week 4. Amount of formula usually starts around 10%\u201312% of body weight per day and is gradually increased to 15%\u201320%. Feedings greater than 20% have led to loose stool and other gastrointestinal disturbances (Lombardi et al., 2009). Cheetah cubs should be adequately hydrated to prevent impactions. During feeding, care should be taken to prevent aspiration pneumonia.",

These dietary differences alter blood mineral and vitamin levels, and may predispose cheetahs to nutritional disease, such as metabolic bone disease (Beckmann et al., 2013, Depauw et al., 2012). For this reason, diets should be carefully evaluated, particularly in growing cheetahs, to ensure that they not only meet dietary recommendations for felids, but also that circulating levels of nutrients are adequate.",

Maintaining the cheetahs\u2019 health by providing the proper care in captivity is essential for successful captive propagation, which will become more important as wild populations continue to decline. Providing proper care in captivity depends on a good understanding of their clinical and management needs. The topics of enclosure set-up, stress management and exercise, as well as clinical care are especially pertinent to ensure increased welfare and long-term sustainability of the captive population. Significant progress has been seen over the past decades and management will continue to improve as additional insight is gained from in situ and ex situ studies, as well as from substantial management experience. Global management programs, such as the SSP, EEP, Japanese Association of Zoos and Aquariums (JAZA), and Australasian Zoo and Aquarium Association (ZAA) continue to work within their regions to promote best-practice guidelines for the captive care of cheetahs.",
