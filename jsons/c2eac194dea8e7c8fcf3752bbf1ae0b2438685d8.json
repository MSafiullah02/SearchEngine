            "text": "COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, often produces severe lower respiratory symptoms and has caused 200,000 deaths worldwide. 1 One challenge in halting this pandemic is the absence of evidence demonstrating effective pharmacologic interventions to prevent COVID-19. Vitamin D has been identified as a potential strategy to prevent or treat COVID-19. 2 Vitamin D treatment has been found to decrease other viral respiratory infections, especially in persons with vitamin D deficiency. 3 Vitamin D deficiency is common, affecting nearly half the US population, with higher rates among persons with darker skin or reduced sun exposure, including persons living in higher latitudes in the winter, nursing home residents, and health care workers. 4 COVID-19 is more prevalent among African-Americans, 5 persons living in northern cities in the late winter, 6 older adults, 7 nursing home residents 8 and health care workers, 9 populations which all have increased risk of vitamin D deficiency. 10, 11, 12, 13 Moreover, COVID-19 is less prevalent in pregnant women and children 14 , and in persons living in Japan 15 , in whom rates of vitamin D deficiency are lower. 16, 17, 18 Shelter in place orders to reduce the spread of COVID-19 may also decrease sun exposure, potentially worsening vitamin D levels and providing further rationale for vitamin D supplementation. 19 Given the low risks and low cost of vitamin D treatment, it has been suggested that vitamin D treatment should be rapidly scaled based on existing evidence. 20 , Nevertheless, evidence of whether vitamin D deficiency is associated with COVID-19 infection is lacking and could help establish vitamin D as an evidencebased approach to decrease the burden and potentially the spread of COVID-19.",

This preliminary analysis demonstrated an increased rate of testing positive for COVID-19 among persons with vitamin D deficiency and suggested the importance of examining data on vitamin D treatments after the time of these test results.

The first date of testing positive for COVID-19 was used to determine the testing date for calculating variables defined in relation to the testing date. Patients with a most recent 25(OH)-vitamin D level <20 ng/ml within 1 year of COVID-19 testing were deemed vitamin D deficient. Patients with a most recent vitamin D levels within 1 year \u226520 ng/ml were deemed not vitamin D deficient. Patients treated with calcitriol and with calcitriol levels were classified as vitamin D deficient if the calcitriol levels <18 pg/ml.

Indicators for treatment with D2 and calcitriol were also included.

The results are similar but show some additional differences in some baseline attributes in the small groups with uncertain deficiency status. Controlling for these variables or omitting the groups with uncertain vitamin D status at the time of COVID-19 testing from the analysis did not change our findings. Figure 1 depicts the distribution of most recent vitamin D levels between 1 year before and 14 days before COVID-19 test orders for the sample used in multivariable analysis ( Table 2 ). Among the 35% of patients whose most recent vitamin D-level was deficient, 18% tested positive for COVID-19, compared to 12% for patients whose last vitamin D level was not deficient(p=0.11). Table 2 shows the results of the multivariable GLM model for testing positive for COVID-19. Patients who were likely vitamin D deficient at the time of COVID-19 testing (i.e., their most recent vitamin D level before COVID-19 testing was deficient and they did not have their vitamin D dose increased) had an increased relative risk of testing positive for COVID-19(RR=1.77,p<0.02) compared to patients whose vitamin D level at the time of COVID-19 testing was likely sufficient (i.e., their last vitamin D level was not deficient and they at least maintained their vitamin D dose between the time of their last vitamin D level and when they were tested for COVID-19), for an estimated average rate in the vitamin D deficient group of 21.6%(95%CI[14.0%-29.2%] ) versus 12.2%(95%CI[8.9%-15.4%]) in the vitamin D sufficient group. Testing positive for COVID-19 was also associated with increasing age, and non-white race, and was not associated with comorbidities except for a decreased incidence in persons with conditions associated with immunosuppression. Testing positive for COVID-19 was not significantly more likely for the patients classified as having vitamin D levels of uncertain sufficiency compared to patients with sufficient vitamin D levels. The risk of testing positive for COVID-19 in the likely deficient vitamin D group with a deficient last vitamin D level and no increase in treatment after that level was also not statistically significantly different than the risk of testing positive in the group with a deficient last vitamin D level but some increase in treatment. All these results were robust to including measures of time from last vitamin D level to COVID-19 testing. They also were preserved when the analysis was performed separately for non-white and white persons, though the small number of white persons forced dropping some covariates for model estimation in that subgroup. Because hypertension, obesity and diabetes may be ameliorated by treatment with Vitamin D, sensitivity analyses were also performed omitting these as covariates; this did not significantly change these findings.

While these benefits would be expected to be greatest among vitamin D deficient persons, the low risks of vitamin D supplementation, the costs and limited access to testing and known seasonality of vitamin D levels all argue for population-level supplementation efforts and perhaps targeted testing for groups at high risk for vitamin D deficiency and/or COVID-19, as noted above. Vitamin D deficiency is influenced by genetic factors, including in African Americans, 24 so Vitamin D testing and treatment may play an important role in reducing incidence among the African American community where COVID-19 has been particularly prevalent and morbid.

However, caution is required because of the potential importance of asymptomatic persons in COVID-19 spread. Vitamin D is understood to modulate immune function through effects on dendritic cells and T cells 25 , which may promote viral clearance and/or reduce inflammatory responses that produce symptoms. Higher vitamin D levels correlate with lower IL-6 levels, which is notable because IL-6 blocking agents are a major target for controlling cytokine storm in COVID-19. 26, 27 Vitamin D may also affect metabolism of zinc 28 , which has been found to decrease the replication of coronaviruses. 29 To the extent it decreases viral replication or accelerates viral clearance, vitamin D treatment might reduce spread. On the other hand, if vitamin D reduces inflammation, it might increase asymptomatic carriage and decrease symptomatic presentations, including cough, making it hard to predict its effect on viral spread. Important limitations must be noted. First, the associations observed may not reflect causal effects of vitamin D deficiency on COVID-19, especially since vitamin D deficiency can reflect a range of chronic health conditions or behavioral factors that plausibly reduce the likelihood of treatment of vitamin D deficiency and increase COVID-19 risk.

Our analysis also included patients treated with vitamin D2 or calcitriol, and included calcitriol levels in our definition of vitamin D deficiency, which are often used in patients with chronic kidney disease or hypoparathyroidism. In sensitivity analysis, our results generally strengthened when we omitted these patients. We also note our sample is enriched in persons with vitamin D deficiency because of the large number of African Americans, adults with chronic illness and health care workers, all living in a northern city and exposed to COVID-19 during winter. Vitamin D deficiency may be a smaller risk factor in other populations. The relative simplicity of the analysis performed here would facilitate replication of this analysis in other settings. Since vitamin D deficiency is so prevalent in the US population, and especially in persons with darker skin, who are older and nursing home residents, who are at increased risk for COVID, it seems likely that these findings might be replicated in other settings.",
