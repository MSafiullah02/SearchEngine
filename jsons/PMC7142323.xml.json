However, data on the expression of ACE2 in lung tissue are scarce. In contrast to the intestine, heart, and kidney, ACE2 expression levels in the lung are rather modest [S3]. In addition, experimental research revealed that ACE2 might have a protective role in lung injury. In a mouse model of acute acid-induced lung injury, the knockout of Ace2 resulted in detrimental effects, e.g., reduced lung elastance, reduced blood oxygen levels, and more interstitial edema compared with wildtype mice. Importantly, the effects of a lack of Ace2 might be mediated by reduced inactivation of Ang-2: (a) a double knockout of Ace2 and Ace was able to partially revert the effects; (b) pharmacological blockage or a genetic knockout of the AT1 receptor resulted in curtailing of the consequences of acid-induced lung injury [S4].",

There is also genetic evidence that single-nucleotide polymorphisms at the ACE2 locus are associated with left ventricular parameters in men [S6]. As already mentioned, ACE2 is expressed in the heart and inhibitors of the RAAS system have been described to modulate the system in animal models [4, 5]. While cardiotropism via ACE2 seems plausible, ACE2 might also have protective effects: Mice lacking Ace2 displayed reduced myocardial contractility; of note, similar to what has been observed in lung injury, an additional lack of Ace was able to obvert the cardiac phenotype. This again highlights the important role of ACE2 in counteracting Ang\u20112 [S7].",

In particular, one could speculate that ARB in particular, which limit the detrimental effects of Ang\u20112 without altering the beneficial effects of Ang-(1\u20137), might not increase risk or may even improve outcomes.",
