The crocodile poxvirus F16 protein ortholog has highly significant similarity to prokaryotic serine recombinases and contains all amino acids that comprise the catalytic site. In contrast, F16 orthologs encoded by other poxviruses show only marginally significant similarity to serine recombinases, lack essential amino acids of the active site and are most likely inactive derivatives of serine recombinases. Nevertheless, the conservation of F16L in non-avian poxviruses suggested an important function. However, a VACV mutant with the F16L gene knocked out replicated normally in dividing and quiescent cells. The F16 protein was synthesized early after infection and detected in virus cores. When expressed in infected or uninfected cells, F16 accumulated in nucleoli depending on the level of expression and confluency of cells. Evidence was obtained that F16 forms multimers, which might regulate concentration-dependent intracellular localization.",

            "text": "The Poxviridae comprise a family of large, complex viruses with 130 to N300 kbp double-stranded DNA genomes that infect numerous vertebrate and invertebrate animals (Moss, 2007) . Vaccinia virus (VACV) was used as the vaccine for smallpox eradication and is currently employed as a live recombinant vector for expression studies and development of vaccines against other pathogens and cancer (Moss, 1996) . VACV, by far the most intensively studied poxvirus, replicates entirely in the cytoplasm of infected cells and encodes many of the proteins required for its growth as well as numerous proteins modulating virus-host interactions. The genome of VACV comprises a subset of genes that are common to all or most poxviruses and essential for replication in cell culture and another subset of genes that are specific for the orthopoxvirus genus, mostly nonessential in cell culture and involved in host interactions (Upton et al., 2003) . Those genes that are conserved throughout the Poxviridae have been functionally characterized to varying degree of detail. However, many genes that are present in most but not all chordopoxviruses remain to be analyzed. One example is the uncharacterized VACV F16L gene, which has been retained in all chordopoxviruses except for avipoxviruses. Our interest in this gene, apart from its considerable evolutionary conservation, was stimulated by evidence that the F16 protein ortholog of Nile crocodile poxvirus (CRV) is homologous to site-specific serine recombinases of prokary-otic transposons and bacteriophages (Afonso et al., 2006) . Here we provide a detailed computational analysis of the F16 protein indicating that it is unlikely to have serine recombinase activity, and experimental data showing that the F16L gene is not required for virus growth in cell culture. Remarkably, the F16 protein specifically localized to the nucleoli of infected and uninfected cells.",

Starting with the VACV F16 sequence, an iterative database search using the PSI-BLAST program (Altschul et al., 1997 ) revealed a distant relationship to CRV051 and the lack of any detectable homolog in avipoxviruses. Whereas the CRV protein showed statistically highly significant similarity to numerous proteins of the Ser recombinase superfamily from bacterial and archaeal transposons and bacteriophages (Grindley et al., 2006; Olorunniji and Stark, 2010; Smith and Thorpe, 2002) , the VACV F16 and the other poxvirus orthologs showed only marginally significant similarity (expect value of~0.03 (Altschul et al., 1997) ). Excluding CRV, the detection of homology of the F16 proteins with Ser recombinases required at least two PSI-BLAST iterations, accounting for the absence of such annotation in the Virology 417 (2011) 334-342 literature. Nevertheless, the validity of this relationship was strongly supported by additional search results using the HHSearch method (Soding, 2005 ) that detects Ser recombinases as proteins with the greatest similarity to a Hidden Markov Model generated from the alignment of poxvirus F16 proteins with a 97% confidence.",

            "text": "The region of sequence conservation between F16 proteins and Ser recombinases encompasses the entire catalytic domain of the latter that consists of approximately 140 amino acids (Fig. 1) . All structural elements of the resolvase/recombinase domain appear to be conserved in F16 as indicated by the comparison of the predicted secondary structure of F16 and the crystal structure of resolvases of the Ser recombinase superfamily (Fig. 1) . Strikingly, however, most of the individual conserved amino acid residues of the resolvases/ recombinases have matches only in the CRV protein but not in the other poxvirus F16 sequences. Specifically, all 8 amino acid residues that comprise the catalytic site of the Ser recombinases, namely Tyr6, Arg8, Ser10, Gln14, Gln19, Asp36, Arg68, and Arg71 (using the amino acid numbering of Tn3 resolvase which is nearly identical to Res_1GDT included in the alignment in Fig. 1 ) are conserved in the CRV protein (with the substitution of Glu for Asp36 that is found in many Ser recombinases), whereas only two, Ser10 and Gln19, are represented in the rest of the F16 proteins ( Fig. 1) . Although Ser10 is the main catalytic residue of Ser recombinases that is directly responsible for the nucleophilic attack on the phosphodiester bonds in the target DNA, the other residues in the catalytic site, in particular the three conserved Arg, are also essential for catalysis Stark, 2009, 2010) . Given the concerted loss of 6 of the 8 catalytic residues, and in particular the three essential Arg residues, it can be confidently predicted that F16 proteins are inactivated derivatives of Ser recombinases that possess no enzymatic activity. Thus, whatever the function of these proteins in poxvirus reproduction might be, it does not involve site-specific recombination. Most of the Ser recombinases contain a DNA-binding helix-turn-helix domain to the C-terminus (or less commonly to the N-terminus) of the catalytic domain. The approximately 100 amino acid region following the recombinase homology domain of F16 does not show detectable similarity to any helix-turn-helix domains, although it is predicted to adopt a primarily alpha-helical fold (not shown). This unique domain might mediate functionally important protein-DNA and/or protein interactions.",

Yet the likelihood that the protein lacks Ser recombinase activity left us with no clue as to what that function might be. Our first question was whether F16 was essential for VACV replication. We succeeded in knocking out the F16L gene by replacing it with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene under the control of the synthetic early/late VACV promoter (Chakrabarti et al., 1997) . Green fluorescent plaques formed and the knockout virus v\u0394F16 was plaque purified, suggesting that the function of F16 is nonessential at least in BS-C-1 cells used for its isolation. Plaques produced by v\u0394F16 were compared with wild type (wt) virus on several conventionally used cell lines (BS-C-1, RK13, HeLa, and A543) as well as on two primary cell cultures, chick embryo fibroblasts and human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs). No difference was detected in the plaque size or appearance of the mutant and the wt virus on any of the tested cells ( Fig. 2 and data not shown). Furthermore, no differences in the yields of v\u0394F16 and wt virus were found in a single round of infection of BS-C-1, HeLa, and RK13 cells ( Fig. 3A and data not shown).",

Virus yields were determined over a 48 h period. However, no difference was found in the rate of formation or amount of wt and mutant viruses (Fig. 3B ).

The secondary structure lines show the structural elements for F16 proteins that were predicted using the PSIPRED program (Buchan et al., 2010) and the structural elements extracted from the 1GDT structure; E indicates extended conformation (beta-strand) and H indicates alpha-helix. Asterisks above and beneath the alignment indicate invariant amino acid residues in the F16 sequences and in the selected Ser recombinase sequences, respectively. The catalytic residues of Ser recombinases and the matching residues in the poxvirus sequences are shaded gray. The catalytic serine is shown by white type on black background. The alignment was constructed using the MOFFT program (Katoh et al., 2005) and slightly manually adjusted to improve the alignment of secondary structure elements.

In order to determine which part of the protein might be responsible for targeting to nuclei and nucleoli, we investigated the localization of a truncated mutant of F16 as well as the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of F16 expressed separately. In the truncated mutant of F16 (T), the 21 Cterminal amino acids were removed (Fig. 7A) . This region includes a predicted alpha-helix that is conserved in the chordopoxvirus F16 homologs (not shown) and potentially could be involved in proteinprotein interactions. The T mutant was still targeted to the nucleoli, but showed much less cytoplasmic staining than the full-length protein (Fig. 7B ). In addition, when highly expressed, the T mutant exhibited a characteristic halo that lined the inner side of the nuclear membrane (Fig. 7B) . The N-terminal domain, which is homologous to Ser recombinases, and the unique C-terminal domain of F16 were not targeted to the nucleoli under any conditions. The N-terminal domain was distributed throughout the cell but was specifically excluded from the nucleoli, whereas the C-terminal domain was localized exclusively to the cytoplasm (Fig. 7B) . These results suggest that for the nucleolar targeting of F16 interaction between structural elements located in the N-terminal and C-terminal domains might be required.",

This scenario is reminiscent of other probable bacterial or bacteriophage contributions to the evolution of poxviruses, in particular, the Holiday junction resolvase A22 (Garcia et al., 2000) and the predicted deubiquitinase G6 (Senkevich et al., 2008) as well as the primasehelicase D5 and the DNA-packaging ATPase A32 that are shared with other nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (Koonin and Yutin, 2010) . The subsequent evolution of chordopoxviruses apparently involved the abrogation of the recombinase activity of F16, as evidenced by the substitution of key amino acids in the active site region. This loss of activity occurred after the divergence of CRV [the deepest chordopoxvirus branch (Afonso et al., 2006; Koonin and Yutin, 2010) ] from the common ancestor with the other chordopoxviruses but prior to the radiation of the latter, and the complete loss of this gene in the avipoxvirus branch. The loss of recombinase activity was apparently accompanied by an overall acceleration of evolution and apparently a change of function.",

Given its conservation and early expression shown here, a role in viral DNA replication or recombination seemed one possibility. However, knockout of the F16L gene had no measurable effect on virus growth in any of the many tested cell cultures including resting primary HFFs. Another gene with similar biological features is the G6R gene that is conserved in all poxviruses and encodes a putative deubiquitinating enzyme (Senkevich et al., 2008) . Knockout of the G6R gene has no effect on virus growth in all tested cell cultures and leads only to a slight attenuation in intranasal mouse infection. Conservation of these genes in most poxvirus genera suggests that their functions are not directly involved in the virus growth cycle but may be involved in generic aspects of virus-host interaction as opposed to interactions between viruses and their specific hosts.",

Deletion of M148R does not perturb replication in vitro but reduces virulence in a rabbit model. Another VACV protein, E3L, has been detected in the nuclei of infected cells but its nuclear function (if any) has not been characterized (Yuwen et al., 1993) . Although F16 had a 3xflag tag, the latter is unlikely to cause nuclear or nucleolar targeting as the VACV proteins I3 and B1, containing a C-terminal 3xflag tag and expressed from a transfected plasmid under the control of the CMV promoter, were analyzed in parallel with F16-3xflag and no nucleolar or nuclear membrane staining was detected (TGS, unpublished). Moreover, the 3xflag has been used in numerous studies of subcellular localization of proteins, and no specific effect on nuclear and/or nucleolar targeting has been reported. In particular, the 3xflag tag was used in a genome wide screen of herpesviruses for protein subcellular localization, with no specific effects on protein targeting (Salsman et al., 2008) .",

Thus far, we have been unable to detect an interaction of F16 with cellular nucleolin or nucleophosmin by coimmunopurification (TGS, unpublished) but interactions with other cellular proteins remain a possibility. We did find that F16 interacts with itself to form homodimers or higher order multimers.

For example, a genome-wide screen of three distinct herpesviruses has shown that at least 12 herpesvirusencoded proteins specifically localize to the nucleolus (Salsman et al., 2008) . Targeting of viral proteins to nucleoli has been described not only for DNA viruses such as herpesviruses, adenoviruses, and papovaviruses, and RNA viruses, such as retroviruses and influenza, that possess a defined nuclear stage of reproduction, but also for proteins of RNA viruses without any nuclear stage such as coronaviruses, arteriviruses and filoviruses as well as several groups of RNA viruses of plants (Hiscox, 2007; Hiscox et al., 2010; Taliansky et al., 2010) . Concomitantly, it has become evident than nucleoli are not only the factories of ribosome biosynthesis, as previously thought, but multifunctional and dynamic structures that contain hundreds of cellular proteins and are involved in a variety of signaling pathways, including cell cycle control, regulation of cell division, apoptosis, antiviral defense, cancer, and more (Boisvert et al., 2007; Sirri et al., 2008) . For many viruses, trafficking of viral proteins through nucleoli is an important step in their growth cycle, and accordingly, the viral proteins directed to nucleolus are essential for the viral replication in cell culture. For example, herpesvirus and human immunodeficiency virus proteins that are targeted to the nucleolus have been implicated in viral mRNA processing (Hiscox et al., 2010) . Several proteins of adenoviruses and herpesviruses cause redistribution of nucleolar components, reorganization of the nucleolus and interference with nucleolar function, including disruption of rRNA synthesis, processing and trafficking (Hiscox et al., 2010) .",

On monolayers of BS-C-1 cells, VACV produced clear plaques that were visible after staining with crystal violet; on other cell monolayers, where plaques were less easily discerned, infected cell foci were detected by immunostaining with anti-VACV antibody, followed by protein A conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Carroll and Moss, 1997) .",

The universal fragment (E/L-GFP) was surrounded on both sides by 500 nt flanks to allow homologous recombination into the specific site. All DNA pieces were assembled by overlapping PCR and transfected into BS-C-1 cells infected with 1-2 PFU/cell of VACV. After 24 h, lysates were prepared, new BS-C-1 cell monolayers were infected and green fluorescent plaques of recombinant viruses were isolated and clonally purified. In v\u0394F16, the coding sequence of the F16 gene excluding 19 nucleotides from the 3\u2032 end was replaced by the E/L-GFP cassette. Replacement of F16 by GFP was confirmed using PCR primers that flanked F16; the size of the product was that predicted. In vF16-3xflag the sequence encoding the 3xflag GACTACAAAGACCAT-GACGGTGATTATAAAGATCATGACATCGATTACAAGGATGACGATGA-CAAGTGA was linked to the last codon of F16, followed by the E/L-GFP cassette and then by the last 7 nucleotides of the F16 ORF including its stop codon. The 3\u2032-end nucleotides of F16 ORF were kept to prevent disruption of the downstream F15L gene promoter.",
