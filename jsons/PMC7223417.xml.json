More than one-third of the US adult population meets the criteria for a diagnosis of obesity [1]. Obesity does not affect all racial and ethnic groups equally. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, non-Hispanic African American women are the most at-risk group, followed by Hispanic, non-Hispanic whites, and Asian women [1]. Similar trends are found among men. Weight loss surgery remains the most effective treatment for moderate to severe obesity and resolution of obesity-related comorbidities [2\u20137]. Most bariatric operations have very low rates of morbidity and mortality [8] and are among the more commonly performed operations in the USA [9].",

There is a general consensus that racial and ethnic minorities lose less weight than White patients after bariatric surgery due to a host of influential factors such as the selection of surgery type, sex, age, and access to care [15, 17, 18]. The significant metabolic benefits after bariatric surgery are well-demonstrated; however, minority populations respond with less weight loss and less durable comorbidity resolution [19, 20]. In a retrospective study, Istfan et al. [21] found that Black patients had a higher rate of hemoglobin A1c level increase 2 years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, while these levels remained stable in Hispanic and White patients. To further complicate the issue, Wood et al. [15] found that despite less weight loss 1 year after surgery, remission of sleep apnea and gastroesophageal reflux disease was higher in Black patients.",

Non-Hispanic subjects with [RACE = \u201cUnknown/Not Reported\u201d] were classified as missing. Differences between different racial groups for selected variables were assessed using Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables, and Chi-Square tests for categorical variables. A multivariable, logistic regression analysis was conducted to model the relationship between race and 30-day readmission, after adjusting for relevant variables as covariates (Table 2). A multivariable, multinomial logistic regression model was also postulated to model the relationship between race and respective Clavien-Dindo grade (compared with having no complications) after adjusting for relevant variables as covariates. An ordinal logistic regression model was not used to assess this second relationship because the proportional odds assumption was not met. The covariates that were included in both models are summarized in Table 3, along with the procedure, postoperative BMI, and readmission information. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).",

Disparities can contribute to rising healthcare costs as postoperative complications are a major factor in overall expenditures and resource utilization [38\u201340]. The patient\u2019s perspective and quality of life beyond financial considerations is of great importance and should not be overlooked. Although many minor surgical complications may not have lasting consequences, more severe complications can have significant ramifications contributing to patient disability, stress, and survival. While a certain level of postoperative complications are to be expected, acceptance of complications may vary depending on the previous health of the patient. For example, patients with dramatic improvement of their clinical condition after bariatric surgery may be more willing to accept minor complications as a valid trade-off for improved health as a result of the weight loss operation.",

They also found that Black patients had longer hospital lengths of stay, higher readmission rates, and higher reoperation rates after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Interestingly, Wood et al. [15] recently published a study that failed to show any difference in mortality or serious complications between Black and White patients after primary gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, or adjustable gastric banding using data from the Michigan Bariatric Surgery Collaborative. There was a small increase in rates of any complication and reoperation, but no difference in serious complications after adjusting for surgeon and hospital effects.

Specific reasons behind this are unclear and may reflect an increased incidence of postoperative leak. The MBSAQIP does not have a specific variable for leaks and many authors use drain in place after 30 days as a surrogate [47, 48].

            "text": "There are several limitations of this study. While the MBSAQIP data set is the most comprehensive bariatric database available, it is devoid of information that may identify surgeon training level and experience [12, 49\u201351]. Details of patient income level, insurance status, and geographic location are also absent from the dataset, and may provide additional information regarding socioeconomic factors. While the proportions found in the data set may approximate the general population as a whole [52], estimates indicate that obesity is much higher in Blacks and Hispanics [53] suggesting a disparity in access. While only 5 of the 20 comparisons garnered statistically significant results (Table 6), three remained (Grades I, III, and IV) remained significant for Black patients after adjusting for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni approach, suggesting increased risk of a complication when separated by severity. The considerably smaller sizes of the Asian and Other race groups likely negatively influenced our ability to make any meaningful conclusions compared with the White and Black groups. Of note, we feel that the study is adequately powered regarding the comparison of White and Black patients and these demographics comprise the majority of bariatric operations in the USA.",

            "text": "Significant challenges exist in surgical health disparities research and intervention. Most studies, including this one, utilize retrospective data often collected for other purposes that lack important information on race. A meta-analysis by Haider et al. [12] systematically describes several factors that contribute to disparities including insurance and socioeconomic status, patient willingness to undergo surgery, advanced presentation and disease burden, access to and type of surgery selected, surgeon volume and experience, and hospital volume. Some disparities are known to persist even after controlling for insurance status and socioeconomic status [54, 55]. These conflicting findings highlight the complexity of the topic and prospective studies are needed to better understand patient and surgeon decision making, develop standardized management plans, and to assess the impact of interventions. Enhanced recovery pathways have demonstrated significant improvements in perioperative care by standardizing care [56] and adoption of standardized protocols may help reduce underlying implicit bias that can result in outcome disparities [57, 58].",
