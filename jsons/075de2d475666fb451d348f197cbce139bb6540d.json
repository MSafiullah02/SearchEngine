In addition to racing to develop vaccines, neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) to this virus have been extensively sought and are expected to provide another prevention and therapy tool against this frantic pandemic. To offer fast isolation and shortened early development, a large human na\u00efve phage display antibody library, was built and used to screen specific nAbs to the receptor-binding domain, RBD, the key for Covid-19 virus entry through a human receptor, ACE2. The obtained RBD-specific antibodies were characterized by epitope mapping, FACS and neutralization assay. Some of the antibodies demonstrated spike-neutralizing property and ACE2-competitiveness. Our work proved that RBD-specific neutralizing binders from human na\u00efve antibody phage display library are promising candidates to for further Covid-19 therapeutics development.",

In the past 5 months, the highly contagious virus has since then quickly spread to almost every nation in the world, infecting more than 5 million people and resulting in more than 320,000 deaths 1 . To this date, this pandemic marked the third highly pathogenic coronavirus human infection in the 21st century, after the outbreak of the deadlier Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1). The whole world was caught off guard to this challenge. To flatten the incident curve, social measures such as quarantine, lockdown and distancing were widely applied, leading to a sudden pause of most economic activities. Among all the measures mobilized to combat the plague, like to many others, scientific approach is the decisive and ultimate answer.",

Like dealing many infectious diseases, the first effective step whenever possible is always preventing the initiation of an infection by isolation or prophylaxis measures such as antibody or vaccine. Vaccines potentiating host immune responses and eliciting protective antibody production will quickly mobilize humoral and cellular immunity defenses against subsequent viral invasion. When lack of vaccine, the passive immunity conferred by specific monoclonal antibodies has well been recognized in the treatment of many viral diseases, for example, FDA approved anti-RSV drug Synagis 5, 6 . Based on the limited scientific data, treating Covid-19 patients with convalescent plasma from recovered donors appears safe, clinically effective and reduces mortality 7 . Significant efforts have been made to develop therapeutic antiviral antibodies against SARS-CoV 8 and MERS 9 . High viral biological similarities and promising animal efficacy of these antibodies highlight the potential to obtain Covid-19 specific neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) for its therapy and prophylaxis.",

The portion in S-protein, called receptor binding domain (RBD), is the exact motif that interacts with ACE2 11 . Details of the molecular interaction between RBD and ACE2 have been analyzed to atom level 12 , facilitating the design of blockade agents, including antibody to intervene the entry process. In the meantime, in a race to win this unprecedented battle, every second matters in the generation of lead antibody molecules. Instead of immunizing animals and screening subsequent hybridoma, we took advantages of an in-house very large na\u00efve human antibody phage display library built in our lab. Here we summarized the construction of the library, the isolation and characterization of RBD nAbs, providing strong basis for further development of potential antibody arsenals for COVID-19.",

A large human na\u00efve antibody phage display library (Named as EHL Library) was built in-house based upon conventional phage display technique, in a similar protocol reported earlier 15 . To ensure the library to be a high-value research resource, we adopted multiple measures to achieve extensive diversity and super-size during the whole process. PBMCs of 37 donors from a variety of ethnic groups and nationalities across the world, including Latinos, African American, Caucasian, Chinese, Russians, Hindus, Vietnamese, Philippines, Native American, Japanese and Jewish etc. were collected to enhance the diversity range of antibody variable genes to be used in the scFv assembly. 7 subfamilies of variable heavy (VH) genes, 7 subfamilies of variable kappa genes ( V\u03ba ) and 11 subfamilies of variable lambda genes ( V\u03bb) were separately amplified and recovered. Two types of scFv libraries, VH-V\u03ba and VH-V\u03bb, were separately assembled and cloned into phagemid pADL-10b, resulting two types of scFv libraries, each containing more than 5\u00d710 10 colony forming unit (cfu) in size, after total 100 repeats of electroporation of ligated phagemid constructs. Random sequencing of 100 colonies of each library revealed over 80% of correct scFv-coding and full usage of all antibody subfamily genes (data not shown). The utility and quality of the EHL Library were validated by successful screening of specific hits over a dozen of selected human targets, mostly tumor-associated antigens, with average KD of two digits nM (data not shown).",

A mammalian cell line ID8 was generated by transfection of 293FT with a pseudo lenti vector that contains gene encoding the full-length Covid-19 spike protein, a transmembrane motif (TM) and a 3xFLAG tag at C-terminal (Fig. 1, A) and selected under Blasticidin S hydrochloride. To verify the spike expression, structure and function, ID8 cells was stained by anti-FLAG-FITC (Fig. 1, B) or human ACE2-mFc, followed by anti-mouse-FITC (Fig. 1, C) . and analyzed by FACS. Results showed that both stains exhibited significant right shift of ID8 population (Fig.1 , B and C, red peaks), validated the ID8's ability to bind ACE2, indicating the spike is in trimeric membrane status and mimics the function of Covid-19 spike 16 .",

Antibodies, RBD or ACE2 were loaded to appropriate sensors sequentially, typically that the previous step has been well equilibrated. The ascending or flat response curves recorded corresponding component incubated with sensors implied yes/no interaction among proteins between adjacent layers (Fig.5 ). Some observations are clear to see from the Blitz results: All hit clones bind to RBD by Blitz (Fig.5 , A,B,C); 1B1 can concurrently bind to RBD with the other 6 antibodies (such as 1B11 etc.)except 5C2 (Fig.5 B,D) ; 1B1 mutually competes with 5C2 ( Fig.5, C) .

We found that when ACE2-mFc was around 0.02 \u00b5g/ml , ~100% ID8 cells were positive by FACS (Fig.8 , green histograms), indicating very strong interaction between Covid-19 spike and ACE2. For the neutralization assay, we set up a serial dilution (2 times down) of every candidate antibody from the 10 \u00b5g/ml to ~0.31 \u00b5g/ml (a point where there was minimal impact on ACE2-mFc binding to spike+ cells in a preparatory experiment) , added them individually to same fixed amount of ID8 cells and incubated enough time to saturate the cells (spike). Next, the saturation concentration of ACE2-mFc was loaded to compete out antibody. Finally, only signals from FITC channel was collected, which were the MFI (mean fluorescence intensity) numbers of ACE2-mFc binding to ID8 cells. Histograms of part of the diluted sample concentrations (shown in Fig.8 ) clearly demonstrated that some the RBD-hits, such as 5C2, can objectively block Covid-19 spike from binding to ACE2 at various concentrations.",

Antibody Phage display technology has contributed antibody drugs such as FDA-approved blockbuster (Humira) and many clinical stage testing candidates 25 . Generally, immune libraries are preferred for the generation of antibodies against infectious disease related targets due to the biased antibody repertoires as a result of exposure and in vivo evolution of immune response to the infection 26 . However, the target specific libraries must be constructed each time to get enriched antibodies against antigens from different infections. A human PBMC-derived na\u00efve phage na\u00efve display antibody library is a ready-to-go tool, being particularly valuable resources to general targets and shortened R&D process when developing antibodybased clinical therapeutics. Diversity and library size are the two most critical parameters in generating a useful library for any given target 27 . In the study we first reported how such a library was built and became a key resource to the R&D of antibody-based diagnostics and biotherapeutics .",

Dozens of unique primary positive phage antibodies to RBD were selected by monophage ELISA and proved to be very specific for Covid-19, with no cross binding to the other two closely related corona virus members, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. Through BLI analysis on Blitz these antibodies span at least two independent groups of epitopes, each occupying part if not the complete ACE2 binding site in RBD. Additionally, their viral neutralizing potency was evaluated by competition FACS. 3 of the 8 hits demonstrated mild to significant competition in a concentration dependent mode to reduce spike binding to ACE2, suggesting their preventative and therapeutic potentials in combating the Covid-19 pandemic.",

In that regard nAbs are the best correlate of protection from viral infection after vaccination. Nabs offers the direct function of abolition of a pathogen's infectivity upon binding, with no participation of any other components of the innate or adaptive immune system. So, neutralization is probably the most robust and powerful function that antibodies exert against viruses. In a broadly sense antibodies can neutralize viral infectivity in several additional ways 40, 41 . They may block viral uptake into cells, prevent uncoating of the genomes in endosomes, cause aggregation of virus particles, or lyse the viral membrane through by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). These protective antibodies are targeting components in other viral cycle steps, as well as utilizing human immune system to clear virus 42 .",

More mutations are likely to emerge as the virus continues to transmit across ethics and global regions. Subsequently monoclonal antibody reacting to specific epitope in RBD is probably vulnerable to the mutations and glycosylation modifications. Additional studies to dissect the exact recognizing residues of any candidate neutralizing Covid-19 antibody are necessary before moving to further development. Alternatively, as backup it's rational to develop broad nAbs to more conservative regions in spike 44, 45 . In fact, nAbs targeting a highly conserved epitope in RBD has been isolated from convalescent plasma of SARS patient 46 .
