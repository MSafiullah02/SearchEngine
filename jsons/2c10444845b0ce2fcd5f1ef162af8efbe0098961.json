Ribavirin, a purine Community-Acquired Respiratory Viruses Gottlieb 215 nucleoside analogue with efficacy against many RNA viruses, including RSV, hMPV, and PV, represents a viable treatment option for PV infection. Ribavirin has been shown to have in vitro activity against RSV and the aerosolized form has been approved for the treatment of lower respiratory tract disease due to RSV in certain at-risk populations. Data for intravenous use of ribavirin remain limited in LTx recipients. 25 Drawbacks with inhaled ribavirin include difficulties in administration, requiring continuous inhalation, along with associated risks of bronchoconstriction and respiratory distress, which may necessitate discontinuation. In addition, aerosolized ribavirin is considered to be potentially hazardous and teratogenic to the environment including health care workers as well as being excessively expensive. Considering these limitations, widespread acceptance of the nebulized administration is missing. Several centers use oral ribavirin as an off-label alternative treatment in paramyxovirus infections in LTx. 26 A retrospective study demon-strates no significant differences in 6-month outcomes between oral and inhaled ribavirin therapy for RSV infection after LTx. 27 In a recent multicenter trial involving 77 RSV-infected patients from 33 sites in Australia, Austria, Germany, France, Canada, and the United States, inhaled ribavirin was used in 24% infected individuals, oral ribavirin in 16%, intravenous ribavirin in 11%, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in 5%, pulsed steroids in 38%, and palivizumab in 6%. 9 The optimal duration of ribavirin therapy is unknown, although treatment orally for 14 days led to virus elimination in 89% of patients in a retrospective study. 28 Of particular note, ribavirin was contraindicated in 42% of PV-infected recipients in this study and was terminated early in another quarter of cases due to adverse effects. Twice-weekly monitoring of blood cell counts (risk of hemolytic anemia) and renal function is mandatory while under ribavirin therapy. Compared with other patient populations treated with ribavirin, more frequent discontinuation due to toxicity was necessary in the LTx population. The most likely explanation for this remains combined toxicity of ribavirin and that inherent to the maintenance medication required after LTx. Distinction must be made between the short-and longterm effects of treatment with ribavirin. Prior studies have focused on short-term effects of ribavirin treatment, such as survival of the acute phase or shorter hospital length of stay, and found no beneficial effect. Retrospective single-center studies suggest that LTx patients treated with ribavirin have a better pulmonary function 6 months after paramyxovirus infection and have found that oral ribavirin reduces the number of complicated courses of paramyxovirus infection and reduces the long-term risk of BOS %.
