As a consequence of the African swine fever epidemic, pig producers in China are shifting to the production of alternative proteins, namely poultry (Buholzer, De Nardi, Schuppers, & Sperling, 2020) . If biosecurity measures are not adapted accordingly, producers are at increased risk of avian influenza circulation, especially in backyard farms that are more vulnerable to disease incursion and more difficult for authorities to reach. An enzootic disease could be exchanged for a zoonotic disease with pandemic potential, with higher capability to spread faster globally and that is harder to control (Buholzer et al., 2020) . The upside is that restricted movement of pigs and pork products throughout China might slow the spread of African swine fever.",
