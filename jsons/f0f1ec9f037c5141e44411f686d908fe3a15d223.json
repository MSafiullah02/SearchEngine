            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) poses a threat to public health. The virus is endemic in the Middle East but can be transmitted to other countries by travel activity. The introduction of MERS-CoV into the Republic of Korea by an infected traveler resulted in a hospital outbreak of MERS that entailed 186 cases and 38 deaths. The MERS-CoV spike (S) protein binds to the cellular protein DPP4 via its receptor binding domain (RBD) and mediates viral entry into target cells. During the MERS outbreak in Korea, emergence and spread of viral variants that harbored mutations in the RBD, D510G and I529T, was observed. Counterintuitively, these mutations were found to reduce DPP4 binding and viral entry into target cells. In this study, we investigated whether they also exerted proviral effects. We confirm that changes D510G and I529T reduce S protein binding to DPP4 but show that this reduction only translates into diminished viral entry when expression of DPP4 on target cells is low. Neither mutation modulated S protein binding to sialic acids, S protein activation by host cell proteases, or inhibition of S proteindriven entry by interferon-induced transmembrane proteins. In contrast, changes D510G and I529T increased resistance of S protein-driven entry to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies and sera from MERS patients. These findings indicate that MERS-CoV variants with reduced neutralization sensitivity were transmitted during the Korean outbreak and that the responsible mutations were compatible with robust infection of cells expressing high levels of DPP4. IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV has pandemic potential, and it is important to identify mutations in viral proteins that might augment viral spread. In the course of a large hospital outbreak of MERS in the Republic of Korea in 2015, the spread of a viral variant that contained mutations in the viral spike protein was observed. These mutations were found to reduce receptor binding and viral infectivity. However, it remained unclear whether they also exerted proviral effects. We demonstrate that these mutations reduce sensitivity to antibody-mediated neutralization and are compatible with robust infection of target cells expressing large amounts of the viral receptor DPP4.",

In contrast, transmission of MERS-CoV to humans induces fatal disease in about 36% of the afflicted patients (4) . Most MERS cases have been documented in the Middle East, but the virus has been introduced into several other countries due to international travel. At present, human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV is inefficient. However, massive MERS outbreaks have been observed in hospital settings (5) . For instance, the introduction of MERS-CoV into the Republic of Korea by a single infected traveler in 2015 resulted in 186 infections, including secondary, tertiary, and quaternary cases, and 38 deaths (6, 7) . Whether the virus responsible for the Korean outbreak harbored mutations that promoted human to human spread is incompletely understood.",

MERS-S contains a surface unit, S1, and a transmembrane unit, S2. The S1 subunit binds to the main receptor, DPP4/CD26 (8) , and the secondary receptor, sialic acids (9) , while the S2 subunit facilitates fusion of the viral envelope with a cellular membrane. Membrane fusion depends on prior proteolytic cleavage (activation) of the inactive S protein precursor, S0, by host cell proteases. Specifically, the endosomal cysteine protease cathepsin L (CatL) and the type II transmembrane serine protease, TMPRSS2, located at the plasma membrane can activate MERS-S (10) (11) (12) . Sequence analysis revealed that MERS-CoV variants observed during the Korean outbreak contained polymorphisms D510G and I529T and that the respective viral variants were transmitted to other patients (13, 14) . The D510G and I529T polymorphisms are located in the receptor binding domain (RBD) (Fig. 1) , a portion of S1 that is required for binding to DPP4, and one can speculate that they might increase viral fitness and/or transmissibility. However, counterintuitively, both D510G and I529T were shown to decrease binding to DPP4 and I529T was shown to decrease MERS-S-driven entry into cells (14) , and it is at present unknown whether the virus benefits from these changes.",

Moreover, we confirm that D510G and I529T reduce DPP4 binding but show that this translates into reduced entry only when small amounts of DPP4 are expressed. Finally, we demonstrate that D510G and I529T reduce sensitivity to antibody-mediated neutralization, suggesting that these mutations might not alter viral transmissibility but might increase viral spread in infected patients in the presence of an antibody response. D510G and I529T do not alter sialic acid dependency of viral entry. A recent study showed that MERS-S can bind to sialic acids, glycans presented on plasma membrane proteins and lipids, and that sialic acid engagement promotes S proteindriven entry (9) . We enzymatically removed sialic acids by neuraminidase (NA) treatment to investigate whether the Korean polymorphisms or the polymorphisms found in the Middle East impact sialic acid dependence. Neuraminidase treatment markedly reduced influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA)-driven entry but had no effect on entry driven by VSV-G (Fig. 4) , as expected. Moreover, entry driven by MERS-S WT and S protein variants was comparably inhibited by neuraminidase treatment (Fig. 4) , indicating that none of the amino acid changes in MERS-S altered sialic acid dependence of viral entry.",

Therefore, we investigated whether the polymorphisms under study modulated the capacity of MERS-S to employ CatL and TMPRSS2 for activation. For this, we first employed 293T cells, which express endogenous CatL but not TMPRSS2 and allow MERS-S-driven entry in a CatL-dependent fashion (10, 24) . The cells were transfected with DPP4 plasmid and either TMPRSS2 encoding or empty plasmid (control), incubated with the CatL inhibitor MDL28170, and then analyzed for S protein-driven transduction. Incubation of control cells with MDL28170 reduced entry driven by MERS-S WT and S protein variants, and this effect was fully rescued by directed expression of TMPRSS2 (Fig. 5A ). Next, we FIG 2 All MERS-S variants analyzed were robustly expressed and incorporated into rhabdoviral particles. (A, top) Expression plasmids for the indicated S proteins or empty plasmid (control) were transfected into 293T cells. Whole-cell lysates (WCL) were prepared from transfected cells, and S protein expression was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-V5 antibody reactive against the V5 epitope at the C terminus of the S proteins. Detection of \u2424-actin (ACTB) served as a negative control. Similar results were obtained in three separate experiments. (B, top) Expression plasmids for the indicated S proteins or empty plasmid (control) were transfected into 293T cells and the cells were then used to produce rhabdoviral particles. The particles were subsequently pelleted by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion and analyzed for S protein expression by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Detection of vesicular stomatitis virus matrix protein (VSV-M) served as a loading control. (A and B, bottom) Immunoblots conducted for panels A (n \u03ed 3) and B (n \u03ed 6) were subjected to quantitative analysis using ImageJ software. S protein signals were normalized against the corresponding signals for ACTB or VSV-M, and expression and particle incorporation, respectively, of MERS-S WT were set as 100%. For S proteins that yielded two bands (S0 and S2), the two signals were combined before normalization. Mean values are shown; error bars indicate SEMs. Statistical significance of differences in particle expression or incorporation efficiency between MERS-S WT and variants was analyzed by paired two-tailed Student t tests. investigated S protein activation in Caco-2 cells, which express endogenous TMPRSS2 (27) and afforded the opportunity to visualize a potentially more subtle impact of the S protein polymorphisms on activation by TMPRSS2. However, incubation of Caco-2 cells with rising concentrations of camostat mesylate, a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, comparably reduced entry driven by MERS-S WT and S protein variants and had no effect on VSV-G-mediated entry (Fig. 5B) , as expected. These findings suggest that the polymorphisms under study did not compromise S protein activation by CatL and TMPRSS2 and did not endow the S protein with the ability to use low levels of TMPRSS2 activity with increased efficiency for S protein activation.",

Moreover, expression of IFITM2 but not IFITM1 and IFITM3 diminished MERS-S WTmediated host cell entry, as expected, and similar effects were observed for the S protein variants analyzed (Fig. 6 ). Finally, comparable results were obtained with 293T cells transiently transfected with escalating amounts of IFTIM2 plasmid, although variant F473S showed a slightly reduced IFITM2 sensitivity under these conditions (data not shown).

Therefore, we asked whether the polymorphisms under study impact antibody- mediated neutralization. We focused our analysis on D510G and I529T since these changes modulated the efficiency of host cell entry. First, we tested whether D510G and I529T alter inhibition of S protein-driven entry by the murine antibody F11, which binds to an epitope encompassing amino acid 509, and macaque antibody JC57-14, which recognizes an epitope including amino acid 535 (29) . Indeed, exchange D510G rendered MERS-S-driven entry insensitive to inhibition by F11, while I529T reduced Table 1 ). One serum sample was of sufficient quantity for detailed analysis (CSS53), while the others could be tested only at a single dilution (CSS16 and CSS23). Remarkably, MERS-S harboring polymorphism D510G showed a significantly increased resistance against neutralization by one serum sample (CSS16), and polymorphism I529T diminished neutralization by two sera (CSS16 and CSS53 [ Fig. 7B and C]). Finally, neither mutation had any impact on neutralization by serum sample CSS23. However, the overall neutralizing activity of this particular serum sample was reduced compared to those of the other sera tested and might have been too low to allow for differential neutralization of MERS-S WT and mutants D510G and I529T. In summary, our results suggest that increased resistance against humoral immune responses might have driven the emergence of the D510G and I529T variants.",

Unexpectedly, these mutations reduced DPP4 binding and viral entry (14) , raising the question of whether they were beneficial to the virus. We found that D510G and I529T were compatible with robust S protein-driven entry into cells expressing large amounts of DPP4 and conferred resistance against antibody-mediated neutralization. These findings support the previously proposed concept that escape from antibody responses might shape MERS-CoV evolution and might come at the cost of reduced DPP4 binding (30) .

This may have various reasons, including differences in patient care and virulence of the MERS-CoV strains responsible for the outbreaks (14) . The I529T mutation has been detected in 72% of patients in Korea examined by one study and might have already been present in the index patient (14) . Similarly, the S protein sequences from 26 out of 38 patients deposited in the virus variation database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/ viruses/variation/) contain the I529T change. Moreover, viruses harboring this mutation established secondary, tertiary, and quaternary infections (13, 14) . In contrast, the D510G mutation was present in only 8% of patients analyzed in a previous study, and 6 out of 38 S protein sequences (16%) deposited in the virus variation database contained this exchange. Kim and colleagues reported that D510G and particularly I529T diminish binding of MERS-S to DPP4 and reduce entry into 293T cells transfected to express DPP4 (14) .

Therefore, we investigated whether the previously reported negative effect of D510G and I529T on MERS-S-driven entry was dependent on DPP4 expression levels. Our results show that this is indeed the case: both mutations markedly reduced entry into 293T cells, which expressed low levels of endogenous DPP4 mRNA and protein, but had little effect on entry into Caco-2 cells, which express large amounts of DPP4. Robust expression of DPP4 has been detected in viral target cells in the human respiratory epithelium, type I and type II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages (8, 32) , and it is thus conceivable that WT virus and virus bearing D510G or I529T infect these cells with comparable efficiencies in the lung of MERS patients. Finally, one can speculate that engagement of attachment-promoting factors ex-pressed in viral target cells in the human respiratory tract but not the cell lines studied here might allow mutants D510G and I529T to compensate for reduced DPP4 binding and to enter cells with the same efficiency as WT virus.",

Therefore, we addressed whether D510G and I529T might augment viral spread by promoting S protein activation or by changing the choice of S protein-activating protease. Two interconnected routes have been described for MERS-S activation. Upon binding to DPP4, either the virus may be transported into host cell endosomes, where the S protein is activated by cathepsin L, or the S protein may be activated at the cell surface by TMPRSS2 (10, 11, 24) . Notably, the choice between CatL and TMPRSS2 might be determined by S protein processing in the infected cell: S protein cleavage by furin in infected cells seems to be indispensable for subsequent DPP4-induced conformational changes in the S protein that are in turn essential for activation by TMPRSS2 (36) . The present study demonstrates that D510G and I529T impact neither S protein cleavage by furin nor S protein activation by TMPRSS2 or CatL.

The DPP4 ligand adenosine deaminase, which is highly expressed in lymphoid tissue and constitutes a component of the purine salvage pathway (37) , has been shown to compete with MERS-S for DPP4 binding and to block MERS-S-driven entry into target cells (31) . Moreover, the IFN-induced transmembrane proteins IFITM2 and, to a lesser degree, IFITM3 were demonstrated to block MERS-S-driven entry, at least upon overexpression (28) . Finally, MERS-S has been shown to bind to a coreceptor, sialic acid, which promotes viral entry into target cells (9) . Our results indicate that D510G and I529T do not impact the above-named processes, suggesting that both mutations might affect neither viral attachment to cells nor the membrane fusion reaction.",

Neutralizing antibodies can be directed against the RBD and interfere with viral entry by blocking DPP4/S protein interactions. A previous study conducted with cell culture systems found that MERS-CoV can acquire mutations that allow escape from RBD-targeting neutralizing antibodies but also provided evidence that such mutations might come at the cost of decreased DPP4 binding and viral fitness (30) . Such a scenario generally matches our findings that D510G and I529T render the S protein at least partially resistant against neutralization by monoclonal antibodies and sera from MERS patients and reduce DPP4 binding. However, our results also allow the speculation that reduced DPP4 binding might not necessarily translate into reduced viral spread in host cells expressing high levels of DPP4. This possibility awaits confirmation with infectious MERS-CoV and primary target cells. Nevertheless, it would be in keeping with the observation that viruses harboring the I529T change were robustly transmitted between patients during the MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea (14) , although the I529T change did not provide the virus with an advantage in the absence of humoral responses. Finally, our finding that single point mutations in MERS-S can increase resistance to antibody-mediated neutralization highlights the need to develop vaccines and therapeutics that simultaneously target multiple epitopes in MERS-S.",
