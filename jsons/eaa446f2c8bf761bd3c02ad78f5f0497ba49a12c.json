First, the number of cases could increased due to a delay in the delivery of swab samples to Lima and the subsequent test results to the respictive provinces. During this early phase of the outbreak, the only available laboratory was the National Institute of Health (INS), located in Lima. Therefore patients in other provinces had to wait more than 3 days for their laboratory result [3] , which may have resulted in a higher transmission rate and an improper medical management and isolation containment of the true cases. Second, the place were the sample was taken could increase the rate of false negatives. A recent report [4] indicated that the results of molecular tests, such as RT-PCR, depend on where it is obtained. This is because there is a difference between bronchoalveolar lavage fuild especimens (93%) compared to the nasal swabs (63%) and pharyngeal swabs (32%); the last one is the location where health perssonel take the samples of the Peruvian suspected cases.",

Furthermore, several individuals did not respect the require \"social distancing\" bewteen person to person.
