At the start of the 21st century, the international community experienced a similarly frightening public health emergency, on a global scale, with the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Severe acute respiratory syndrome was an unusual corona virus-based pneumonia that spread rapidly [1]. The SARS epidemic demonstrated that one effect of globalization has been to make it possible for an infectious disease to travel from one continent to another in a matter of hours and highlighted the importance of international coordination of efforts to respond to novel outbreaks of infectious disease. It was first detected in November 2002 in China's Guangdong province and eventually affected more than 25 countries. China was one of the most severely affected countries, and Beijing was among the world's most heavily affected cities, according to the World Health Organization's summary report [2], [3].",

Table 2, part A, reports the findings from the analysis comparing those having high depressive symptom levels (CES-D scores of 25 or higher) with those having low depressive symptom levels (CES-D scores of less than 16). In model 1, controlling for age, sex, marital status, family income, and prior exposure to other traumatic events, the effect of any quarantining remained statistically significant, with an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of 4.90 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.19-10.99; P = .0001); high work exposure, however, had a smaller effect size here (AOR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.00-4.92; P = .05). Single respondents were more likely than married respondents to have high depressive symptom levels (AOR, 4.35; 95% CI, 1.65-11.42; P = .0029). Having been exposed to other traumatic events before SARS was significantly associated with high depressive symptom levels (AOR, 3.39; 95% CI, 1.47-7.84; P = .004). In model 2, perceived risk level during the SARS outbreak and altruistic acceptance of risk were added into the regression equation. Both of these variables were found to be significantly associated, although in opposite directions, with high depressive symptom levels. Specifically, higher during-outbreak-perceived SARS-related risk levels appeared to increase the odds of having a high current level of depressive symptoms (AOR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.27-1.86; P < .0001), whereas altruistic acceptance of SARS-related risk appeared to decrease those odds (AOR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.12-0.56; P = .0005). In the third and final model, a high PTSD symptom level was found to be significantly associated with a high depressive symptom level (AOR, 7.40; 95% CI, 2.83-19.36; P < .0001). With regard to the other factors that had been previously identified as significant predictors, their associations with high depressive symptom levels remained essentially the same, except that the effect of high work exposure became nonsignificant in model 2, when perceived risk and altruistic acceptance of risk were included in the equation, and remained nonsignificant in model 3, when PTSD symptom level and the current high-stress job indicator were also included.",

Studies of health care workers affected by the SARS outbreaks in Toronto, Canada, and in Taiwan found quarantining experience to be predictive of subsequent general psychologic distress [32], [34], [35], [36], [37]. In these studies, increased SARS-related fear, loss of social support, and increased stigmatization by individuals who now saw these health care workers as more likely, compared even with other health care workers, to be sources of disease infection [34] were found to be aspects of the quarantine experience that helped to explain quarantined individuals' elevated levels of psychologic distress [32], [34], [37], [38].",

Employees' own fears of dying from the disease and of losing family members to it would, thus, have tended to be especially strong at the time when they were quarantined.",

Unlike in Canada, quarantining in China was often a group affair. Healthy hospital staff could be selected to be quarantined together with hospital patients and were often required to continue working, caring for those patients, while quarantined [39]. These quarantined health care staff would have known that, even if they had not already been infected with SARS, they would, because of being placed in these situations, remain at high risk of eventually becoming infected because of their continued contact with patients with SARS. However, those who continued working in these settings may also have experienced the satisfaction of knowing that they continued to play an important role in society that would have been valued by many of the patients they worked with. Again unlike their Canadian counterparts, however, most of the quarantined hospital employees in our sample experienced a period of at least 10 days of being unable to see or be with their families at all. (The median length of the quarantine periods was 14 days.) This aspect of their quarantining may have led to especially severe distress, but its effects are difficult to measure with any precision.",

This is somewhat in contrast to the finding of our previous study of the same hospital employee population [18], which focused on post-outbreak symptoms of PTSD. In that study, pre-SARS traumatic experience was not found to be predictive of later SARS-related PTSD symptom levels. On the surface of it, the direction of this contrast seems surprising because traumatic experiences have frequently been found to be more strongly predictive of PTSD than of depression [41], [42], [43], [44]. It must be noted, however, that the IES-R, the instrument that we used to measure PTSD symptoms, was, like most instruments, designed to measure only PTSD symptoms associated with memories of a single specific event or set of events\u2014in this case, the SARS outbreak. The respondents were not asked about PTSD symptoms they might currently be having because of sudden or violent traumas experienced before the SARS outbreak. It should also be noted that although the SARS outbreak was indeed a highly stressful, often traumatic, and life-threatening experience for those affected by it, the types of stressful events it engendered were somewhat different in nature from those mentioned in the instrument that was used to measure traumas had before SARS. The instrument had been adapted from one used in previous disaster research [23], [45]. The events described in the prior trauma instrument are generally sudden, noisy, and violent ones, unlike SARS, which caused harm to its victims in ways that were long-term rather than short-term and comparatively subtle, slow, and quiet. In this sense, the stresses caused by the SARS epidemic would not be expected to be evocative of the types of stresses mentioned in the prior trauma questions. Thus, perhaps it is not really surprising to find that the prior trauma items were, in our sample, predictive of respondents' later depressive symptoms but unrelated to their later symptoms of SARS-related PTSD. Some of our respondents may, unbeknownst to us, have been having either clinical-level or subthreshold PTSD syndromes linked to their memories of events that occurred before the SARS outbreak, which in turn may have been contributing to their relatively high levels of depressive symptoms. Future studies examining the psychologic effects of both recent and less recent traumatic experiences should consider the similarities and differences found between various types of traumatic experiences in designing their survey instruments.",
