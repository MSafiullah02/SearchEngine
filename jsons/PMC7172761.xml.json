            "text": "Atopy is the predisposition to develop allergic diseases. The phenotype of allergy seems to have a complicated and variable genetic contribution. Gene\u2013environment interactions have been identified,5 and add another layer of variability to the development of allergic disease. There is no single genetic test to identify if an individual is likely to be atopic. Genetic studies looking at single nucleotide polymorphism have focused primarily on allergic inflammatory cells and mediators. Although hundreds of associations have been identified, each alone tends to be difficult to reproduce or represents only a small percentage of allergic individuals.6 Large genome-wide association studies use a hypothesis-independent strategy to identify which genes are statistically different between an affected and nonaffected population. In asthma, genome-wide association studies have identified a small number of genes, such as ORMDL3,7, 8 of which the functions remain unclear. Currently, the allergy phenotype probably represents multiple and variable combinations of genetic predispositions many of which require a specific environmental interaction to be manifested. So far, the genes identified suggest alterations in both innate and adaptive immunity play a significant role in allergic disease.9\n",

For AR, family history of atopy is one of several risk factors that include cigarette exposure; higher socioeconomic class; first-born or only child; and elevated total IgE (>100 IU/L) before age 6 years.10 In the Danish twin study of asthma by Skadhauge and coworkers,11 the proban-wise concordance of monozygotic males to develop asthma was 0.51 (0.39\u20130.63), whereas dizygotic opposite sex twins was only 0.07 (0.03\u20130.11). Another study showed that of those with one asthmatic parent, 26% developed asthma. Of note, maternal history was more predictive.12 Although not definitive, asking about allergies in first-degree relatives is useful in the evaluation of a child with chronic upper or lower respiratory inflammation.",

One study suggested that North American children born in the late fall have a higher risk of developing asthma.13 This is attributed to the role of winter respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus, occurring in the first few months of life increasing the risk of asthma. However, the authors are not aware of any recommendations advising timing of pregnancy based on allergy risk because studies are conflicting and the overall evidence insufficient. Restricting maternal diet in pregnancy from proallergic foods has been shown not to affect the development of atopy in the child.14 Some studies have shown some protection from atopy in children delivered vaginally compared with those delivered by cesarean section.15 The affect is attributed to the \u201chygiene hypothesis,\u201d which is discussed later. IgE in cord blood has also been of interest. Nonspecific IgE is produced in utero starting around 11 weeks gestation, but specific IgE is first identified after birth. Initial reports of IgE levels in cord blood predicting atopy have not been supported in later prospective studies.16\n",

            "text": "In the atopic child, the bias of the immune system toward an allergic response is at least partially influenced by lymphocytes. Attention has been focused on T-helper cell lymphocytes because they direct much of the immunologic response to antigens. Stimulated T-helper lymphocytes produce different cytokine profiles that are broadly classified as Th1 or Th2 (a Th3 phenotype has also been described).17, 18 Th1 cytokines primarily influence the immune system to act against bacteria and include interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon-\u03b3. Th2 cytokines direct activity more appropriate toward parasites. The Th2 influence toward IgE and eosinophils also occurs in allergic inflammation. Th2 cytokines include IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. At birth, T-helper lymphocytes are Th2 biased (or allergy biased), and as the immune system develops the T-helper cells change to a Th1 bias. The \u201chygiene hypothesis\u201d suggests that challenges to the immune system early in life facilitate the shift to a Th1 bias, which protects against allergy. Infections early in life,19 or increased risk of infections represented by exposure to siblings or by early entry into daycare,20 have been associated with a decreased risk of later developing allergic disease. Some studies of T lymphocytes from infants at high risk for atopy have shown not only bias toward Th2, but also a decreased production of both Th1 and Th2 cytokines. It may be that the greater reduction of stimulated Th1 cytokines accounts for most of the imbalance compared with controls.21 Paradoxically, as infancy has become more sanitized in developed countries, atopy has become more prevalent. The reason for the increase in allergy is likely to be more complicated than the \u201chygiene hypothesis\u201d alone and multiple competing theories from changes in exposures, to nutrition, to air pollution exist.",

            "text": "Early sensitization to inhalant allergies in infancy occurs, but infrequently. Herr and colleagues27 used a standardized questionnaire in 1850 infants at their 18th-month examination to identify children with AR-like symptoms defined as runny nose, blocked nose, and sneezing apart from a cold. Of the 1850 infants, 9.1% were found to have AR-like symptoms. All children were then assessed with a specific inhalant IgE screen, total IgE, and eosinophilia. There was no difference in eosinophilia or total IgE in the \u201cAR-like symptoms\u201d group compared with the \u201cno AR-like symptoms\u201d group. Inhalant-specific IgE was elevated in 5.5% with AR-like symptoms versus 2.7% (P = .04) of those without symptoms. However, the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) guidelines include both specific IgE sensitization and symptoms in the definition of AR.28 Only 9 of the 1850 children had both AR-like symptoms and elevated inhalant-specific IgE. In comparison, there were 43 of 1850 infants with elevated inhalant-specific IgE that were identified in the \u201cno AR-like symptoms group.\u201d This suggests that AR is rare at 18 months of age and that screening infants for elevated specific IgE would lack specificity in identifying infants with clinical symptoms. Of interest, five of the nine infants with both AR-like symptoms and inhalant-specific IgE elevation were sensitized to dust mite.28 Although AR is uncommon in infancy, viral rhinitis is prevalent. Children less than 6 years old average six to eight \u201ccolds\u201d annually with symptoms lasting 10\u201314 days.29 Rhinovirus accounted for 46% of childhood upper respiratory infections in one study.30 Distinguishing between AR and viral rhinitis is clinically significant because a physician might reasonably treat an infant with AR with antihistamines, but antihistamines have been demonstrated as ineffective compared with placebo in viral rhinitis.31\n",

Viral bronchiolitis (wheezing and tachypnea) accounts for outpatient visits in 15% of infants and 3% are hospitalized.32 The common causes include respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, and coronaviruses. Viral-triggered asthma and bronchiolitis are difficult to distinguish from each other, but viral-triggered asthma tends to occur in children who have multiple wheezing episodes, are older than 2 years, and have a family history of atopy.33 Once children are older than 2 years, an association between viral-induced wheezing and asthma risks (elevation in inhalant-specific IgE, maternal asthma history) becomes significant.34 The clinical distinction between bronchiolitis and asthma affects pharmacologic treatment. Although bronchodilators and corticosteroids are mainstays of asthma treatment, neither bronchodilators35, 36 nor corticosteroids37 have been shown to be effective in uncomplicated viral bronchiolitis (discussed later).",

Interestingly, 16.3% would not be characterized as an elevated rate of AR in some epidemiologic studies of children.56 This underscores how regional differences, age of subjects, and different definitions of AR make comparing outcomes across studies difficult. The American Academy of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery\u2019s 2004 practice guidelines for chronic otitis media with effusion specifically made no recommendation about allergies as a causal agent or effective treatment of chronic otitis media with effusion because of insufficient evidence.83\n",

Asthma comprises a range of heterogeneous phenotypes that differ and overlap in presentation. Although we may be on the cusp of tailoring the diagnosis and treatment of asthma using genetic markers, in 2011 asthma is approached clinically by selecting treatment based primarily on severity and triggers (eg, exercise-induced asthma or allergic asthma).",

Instead, a predictive index may be used based on the cohort data that separated transient wheezing from persistent and late-onset wheezing. Castro-Rodriguez and colleagues103 created a predictive index for ages 2 to 3 years that conferred a 76% chance of asthma by age 6 and a greater than 95% chance of not having asthma by age 6 if negative. Guilbert and colleagues104 modified these criteria for the PEAK study for clinical use. The index used in the PEAK study was recommended by the 2007 National Institutes of Health (NIH) asthma guidelines and is as follows: children between ages 2 and 4 years who have had more than three episodes of wheezing (one physician diagnosed) within 1 year and who have met either one major criteria (parental asthma, physician-diagnosed atopic dermatitis, or inhalant allergen sensitization) or two minor criteria (wheezing unrelated to colds, food sensitization, or eosinophilia >4%). Children positive for this index had fewer asthma exacerbations and decreased burden of disease if treated with inhaled corticosteroids compared with placebo, but early inhaled corticosteroids failed to prevent asthma development.105\n",

Asthma is classified into intermittent and persistent disease. Persistent asthma is stratified into mild, moderate, and severe. Children can be classified based on frequency of wheezing, night time awakenings, frequency of inhaled \u03b22 agonist use, and exacerbations lasting greater than a day. Once classified, simple charts recommend the initial treatment for each age group.4 Asthma is a heterogeneous disease and response to treatment needs to be assessed. In most children, optimally managed asthma should result in no missed school, rare use of rescue inhalers, no emergency room visits, and no hospitalizations. Treating asthma also reduces asthma mortality. The number of corticosteroid inhalers used annually is inversely proportionally to the chance of death in those with asthma.106 The 2007 NIH Asthma Guidelines, including charts for classifying severity, stepwise approach to management, and recommendations for altering therapy based on standardized assessment of the control of asthma control, are available free online. The NIH Asthma Guidelines are written to improve the diagnosis and management of asthma by primary care physicians and can be easily incorporated by otolaryngologists.",
