Sacco University Hospital in Milano, Italy. Our objective was to explore the effects of the administration of anti-platelet therapy on arterial oxygenation and clinical outcomes in patients with severe Covid-19 with hypercoagulability. We enrolled five consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe respiratory failure requiring helmet continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and a pro-thrombotic state identified as a D-dimer > 3 times the upper limit of normal. Five patients matched for age, D-dimer value and SOFA score formed the control group. Beyond standard of care, treated patients received 25 \u00b5g/Kg/body weight tirofiban as bolus infusion, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.15 \u00b5g/Kg/body weight per minute for 48 hours.",

            "text": "Thrombophilia has been repeatedly reported in ICU patients with Covid-19 [3, 4, 18] , often associated with dramatic increases in D-dimer and fibrinogen values [3] . Recent evidence further demonstrated that both D-dimer values > 1.000 \u00b5g/L and higher SOFA scores were associated with increased odds of death in hospitalized patients with Covid-19 [17] . Although sometimes DIC J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f features have been observed in patients with severe Covid-19 [11] , low platelets counts and bleeding were rarely reported [3, 7, 19] , suggesting that hypercoagulability is fostered by the severe inflammatory state [3] . Electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry analyses have recently provided evidence of an elevated number of megakaryocytes and platelet-fibrin thrombi in alveolar capillaries from lung tissue of deceased patients with severe Covid-19 [6] . Megakaryocytes are hematopoietic cells specialized in the production of platelets that migrate from the bone marrow to the lung microvasculature [20] , where they release platelets that are retained and sheared in the pulmonary capillary vessels [20, 21] . We hypothesize that the administration of the GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor tirofiban might have prevented the formation of newly assembling clots promoted by the dysfunctional endothelium of lung capillaries. In fact, both hypoxia and sepsis can independently promote platelet aggregation [22] , mediated by the release of Von Willebrand factor, which was found greatly increased in the whole blood of ICU patients with Covid-19 [3] . The latter effect, associated with the inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase (COX) present in platelets and megakaryocytes and promoted by acetylsalicylic acid and the clopidogrel-related modulation of the ADP megakaryocytes receptor [23] , might have impeded the consolidation of forming thrombi, thus improving regional ventilation/perfusion mismatch and explaining the rapid increase in PaO2 and the reduction in A-a O2 gradient [24] . Moreover, it may be conceivable to suppose that the consequent reduction in the alveolar-endothelial thickness might have led to a local improvement in oxygen diffusion capacity [25] thus in part justifying the increase in arterial PaO2.",

Indeed, an improvement in A-a O2 gradient could be secondary to an improvement in lung perfusion, with consequent positive effects on lung mechanics and respiratory drive, sparing patients from the harmful effects of excessive lung distension and mechanical stress [2] . It should be highlighted that participants entered the study at different timings in respect to the hospital admission. Despite a clear effect size gradient of the study therapy was not discernable, due to the natural history of the disease, it seems plausible to speculate that the maximal therapeutical advantage might be obtained in earlier disease stages. Recent evidence have linked myocardial injury and cardiovascular comorbidities with increased risk of severe disease and death [28] .

Baseline characteristics and disease natural history varied from patient to patient, limiting the generalizability of the results.

Thus the comparison might be biased by worse outcomes in the control group, which might be confounded by baseline lymphopenia, although the difference between groups was not statistically significant. However, it should be recognized that patients had a comparable mortality risk based on the severity of respiratory failure and the elevation of D-dimer. We are also aware of the multiple determinants that drive gas exchange in Covid-19 patients and agree that targeted mechanistic studies are needed to ascertain the results presented. We acknowledge that the best tool to prove the presence of V/Q mismatch and thus to monitor the effects on antiplatelet therapy on lung micro vasculature could J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f have been the ventilation perfusion scintigraphy. Unfortunately, due to the issues related to patients' transport during helmet CPAP therapy, the elevated contamination risk of nuclear medicine environment and healthcare personnel, and the lack of nuclear medicine in our hospital, it was not possible to perform the test. Finally, the opportunity to introduce a triple antiplatelet therapy should be always weighted against the risk of bleeding to which patients are exposed. In patients with COVID-19 without signs of CID, bleeding episodes have been reported especially in patients treated with therapeutic doses of LMWH [18] . Major bleeding events were not observed in the present study. We underline the need for a careful evaluation of the patients' baseline risk factors, and of an accurate assessment of the prevalent dysfunction that drives the hypoxemia.",

Still, which is the best therapeutic approach to face the thrombophilic diathesis of patients with severe Covid-19 remains unknown. Indeed, larger cohorts and randomized trials are urgently needed to answer this question. Variations in the respiratory support after the initiation of study treatment (left) and in controls (right). Each line identifies a patient. Three patients from the treated group (patient #2, patient #3 and patient #5) were weaned from CPAP after three days, and patient #5 was weaned from O2 therapy after seven days. Patient #1 assessment stopped 48 hours after study protocol initiation J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f because he was transferred to the ICU and intubated because of progressive respiratory distress secondary to sepsis. The substantial and rapid increase in PaO2 and PAO2/FIO2 in patient #1 soon after treatment with tirofiban appears disproportionate compared with the variations observed in other patients. The latter was probably secondary to a concomitant increase in cardiac output secondary to impeding sepsis rather than a direct and isolated effect of the experimental treatment.
