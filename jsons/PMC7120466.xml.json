Most of these deaths occur in countries in Africa and Asia. Each year Streptococcus pneumoniae causes approximately 3,300 cases of meningitis, 100,000\u2013135,000 cases of pneumonia requiring hospitalization, and six million cases of otitis media annually in the USA [11]. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 7-valent (PCV7) was approved in year 2000 for its use in the USA. It was designed to cover the seven serotypes that account for about 80% of invasive infections in children younger than 6 years of age. In 2007, the WHO published a position paper recommending all countries to include PCV as part of the routine infant immunization schedule. PCV7 and later PCV13 (13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) have been widely used in the world. There are 142 countries having put PCV13 into national immunization programs.",

GP-specific IgG titers are the important data for the immune response of the vaccine. Anti-Ad5 neutralizing antibody detection was used to analyze the vector immunity and the preexisting immunity influence on the vaccine\u2019s immunogenicity. Specific T-cell response was quantified by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay (IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1), and IFN-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and interleukin-2 (IL-2) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells when phase I and phase Ib clinial trials were conducted in China. Another phase 2 clinical trial was conducted in Sierra Leone in 2015 [22\u201324]. The study results demonstrated that one shot of intramuscular injection with Ad5-EBOV vaccine could elicit strong humoral and cellular immune response in three clinical trials. Ad5-EBOV vaccine produced a considerable GP antibody response and GP-specific T-cell response in healthy African participants in China after 14 days [22]. GP antibody response peaked at day 28 and lasted more than 6 months. With a booster at the sixth month, the GP antibody response can last more than 12 months.

Shingrix is a recombinant, subunit vaccine designed to restore VZV immunity in individuals who are at increased risk of developing Shingles due to age or immunodeficiency [25]. VZV gE is the most abundant envelope glycoprotein, predominantly expressed on the surface of virus-infected cells. The VZV gE protein plays a critical role in virus infectivity since it is involved in virus entry and cell-to-cell spread, harboring sites for N- and O-linked glycosylation. The subunit vaccine elicits stronger virus-specific CD4+ T-cell response as well as antibody B-cell response to gE, compared to the currently used live attenuated vaccine (Zostavax\u00ae). Evidence indicates that the gE protein induces both neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses. The gE antigen component of Shingrix is derived from a VZV strain that was isolated from a patient with severe varicella disease. This antigen is a recombinant truncated form of VZV gE. The recombinant protein is then produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that were genetically modified to express the VZV gE gene [26].",

It was reported that during the Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, about one third of the reported cases were from children or adolescents under 18 years of age [28]. Thus it is important to include children and adolescents in the vaccine development programs for global infectious diseases unless a waiver is granted by the regulatory agencies. In some cases, if the course of the disease and the effects of the drug are sufficiently similar in adults and pediatric patients, the regulators may conclude that pediatric effectiveness can be extrapolated from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults, supplemented with other information obtained in pediatric subjects, such as immune response studies, as pointed out in the US FDA guidance [29].",

            "text": "Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is one of the major causative agents of outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease or herpangina in Asia. An EV71 (Enterovirus 71) vaccine has been developed by Sinovac Biotech (China) using Vero cell and EV71 C4 subgenotype. The Phase 2 study of inactivated vaccine (Vero cell) against EV71 virus has been completed in December 2011 in China. The purpose of the Phase 2 clinical study was to demonstrate the safety and immunogenicity of EV71 vaccine in preventing hand, foot, and mouth disease caused by EV71 in a total of 10,000 healthy infant volunteers aged from 6 to 35 months old. The data from Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies suggested that the inactivated EV71 vaccine had clinically acceptable safety and good immunogenicity for healthy Chinese infants. A Phase 3 clinical trial was conducted in China in 2014 with 10,007 healthy infants and young children (6\u201335 months of age). The vaccine efficacy against EV71-associated hand, foot, and mouth disease or herpangina was 94.8%. Vaccine efficacies against EV71-associated hospitalization and hand, foot, and mouth disease with neurologic complications were both 100%. In the immunogenicity subgroup (1,291 children), an anti-EV71 immune response was elicited by the two-dose vaccine series in 98.8% of participants at day 56. An anti-EV71 neutralizing antibody titer of 1:16 was associated with protection against EV71-associated hand, foot, and mouth disease or herpangina [48\u201355]. EV71 vaccine was approved by the Chinese Drug Administration (formerly CFDA) in 2017.",

This is especially challenging in emergency outbreaks settings, and major efforts would be required to ensure that samples and data are collected from the clinical trial participants. During emergency outbreaks, it is very difficult to track those people and to collect samples for further testing. Integration of data from preclinical and clinical vaccine studies together with data from disease survivors will thus be essential to identify Ebola vaccine correlates of protection.

Studies in European region (2019 ECDC Report on Pertussis) found that young adolescents older than 15 years old had the highest infection rate and young infants less than 6 months old had the most severe infections. The study results demonstrated that the majority of cases above the age of 30 years were unvaccinated. These data stress the need to refine vaccination strategies with the final aim of protecting infants. In the USA and many European countries, immunization of Tdap for adolescents and adults is recommended in the national immunization programs.
