The etiology of an abortion storm may include differential diagnoses that an individual abortion may not, and vice versa. At what state of gestation did the animal experience the loss? The history of the animal is crucial. Breeding records, vaccine history, and method of diagnosis of pregnancy are crucial to assessing for an abortion. If no diagnosis of pregnancy was performed and no fetus was expelled, often the question becomes, was this animal pregnant at all? In these cases, the issue may not be one of abortion but of infertility. Also, records may demonstrate that recurrent pregnancy loss in the particular animal may have been caused by physical or hormonal abnormalities. Last, examination of the animal's diet, prophylactic program, travel schedule, and history of previous illnesses, including any administered medications, may help define the cause of abortion.",

Females with poor body condition or severe weight loss may also experience pregnancy loss, particularly in harsh winters (Figure 23-2\n). Serum may be collected for trace mineral assay, as deficiencies or excess may cause fetal loss. Ultrasonographic examination of the uterus may demonstrate fluid or membrane retention. Uterine culture should be performed using a double-guarded swab and an appropriate culture medium to transport the specimen to the laboratory. A vaginal examination will demonstrate any cervical damage or vaginal lacerations that commonly occur in late-term abortion because sufficient cervical dilation often does not occur before fetal expulsion.

Samples for uterine culture and cytology as well as impression smears of any abnormalities of the placenta may help in the diagnosis. Blood samples from affected and nonaffected females may also be collected to determine seroprevalence and titers for common infectious causes of abortion. Endocrinologic evaluation of the aborting female is often considered by practitioners, but it is not useful after abortion has already taken place.

If the placenta cannot be submitted in its entirety, samples should be obtained from the cervical region, the body of the uterus, and the base, middle, and tip of each horn, as well as from any abnormal-looking area. Samples from lesions should have wide margins, including both normal and abnormal looking areas. Samples should be taken in duplicates and submitted fresh on ice and fixed in 10% formalin (Figure 23-3\n). Particular attention should be given to the number of placentas and the anatomy of the umbilical cord.

The diagnosis rate rarely reaches 30% of all submissions.5 This may be attributed to lack of sufficient clinical and laboratory data and lack of expertise in camelid pathology. As in other species, causes of abortion in alpacas and llamas fall into distinct categories: infectious and noninfectious. Noninfectious causes of abortion may be sporadic or affect several animals in a herd, as in the case of abortions caused by nutritional deficiencies or administration of some drugs. Infectious abortions are further subdivided into the types of organisms responsible: viruses, bacteria, protozoa, or fungi. Noninfectious causes of abortion may be categorized as maternal causes, fetal causes, nutritional causes, and iatrogenic causes. The following sections will detail what is known about these causes of pregnancy loss in alpacas and llamas.",

It was long hypothesized that camelids were more resistant or less susceptible to pestiviral infections compared with domestic ruminants. However, clinical reports and experimental studies in recent years showed that BVDV may represent an emergent and important disease in these species. Growing evidence in the literature suggests that BVDV may be responsible for reproductive wastage in camelids. The most common serotype that affects alpacas and llamas is noncytopathic BVDV-1b.6 Pestiviral infection may manifest as one of several clinical syndromes. Initially, an animal is infected by the virus through exposure to an infected animal; it is hypothesized that BVDV was introduced into camelid populations from contact with infected cattle. Seroconversion and virus shedding occurs, and the animal either shows signs of illness or maintains subclinical infection. Clinical infection is manifested by immunosuppression and subsequent secondary bacterial or viral infections. Commonly affected systems include the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and lymphatic systems, although diarrhea does not seem to be a component of disease in alpacas or llamas. Subclinical infection may not be apparent besides transient fever, inappetance, lethargy, and changes in fleece quality.7\n",

In early gestation, early embryonic death may occur; or in cattle, congenital malformations such as cerebellar hypoplasia, hydrocephalus, microphthalmia, and various other craniofacial, neural, and ocular defects have been reported.8 No congenital defects due to infection with BVDV have been reported in alpacas or llamas.9 Births of persistently infected crias have been documented.7, 10\n11 In cattle, it is known that infection of the pregnant cow before 125 days of pregnancy results in the birth of a persistently infected (PI) animal. This period of immuno-naivety in the pregnancy of alpacas or llamas is not currently known. However, a study of an outbreak on a farm showed that the transplacental infection rate was 82%, resulting in the birth of a PI cria in 70% of the cases (n = 10) when pregnant females were exposed between 64 and 114 days of pregnancy.12 Because of the great variability of pregnancy length, determination of the exact period of susceptibility is very costly. However, on the basis of available information, it may be assumed that this period ranges between 45 and 120 days of pregnancy. During this stage, the fetus is not immunocompetent, and infection by the virus is not recognized by the fetus as non-self; thus, no antibodies to the virus are ever formed. The fetus then becomes tolerant to the infection, and if it survives , the neonate then serves as a source of viral shedding in the herd.11, 13 The final clinical picture is a female that becomes infected late in gestation when the fetus has developed a functional immune system. In these cases, the fetus will mount an antibody response, seroconvert, and usually recover along with the dam. Abortion may occur at any stage of gestation or a weak PI cria may be born prematurely.",

PI crias have been shown to shed the virus in all body fluid and are an important source of contamination.13 Viral isolates from camelids have not completely matched those that infect other ruminants, and geographic location seems to be implicated in camelid disease in North America, as a majority of BVDV cases in camelids reported no contact of affected animals with cattle or sheep.6, 9 It is recommended that producers take precautions with female alpacas or llamas that travel to another farm for breeding along with their suckling cria and develop an isolation protocol for animals that travel for shows. It is recommended that a BVDV screening program be put into effect, with no less than 10% or 15 animals in the herd tested.9 Suckling crias may have circulating antibodies from the dam's milk or if fed bovine colostrum.9\n",

Sheep were present on the farm but were geographically separated and had no abortions that year. Two aborted fetuses were examined. One placenta demonstrated a focal area of necrosis and the other generalized necrotic placentitis. Organisms were isolated from placental tissue as well as from fetal stomach contents. One dam was found to have a swollen tongue with a diphtheritic membrane, which may have been unrelated to Campylobacter infection. Fecal cultures of remaining pregnant alpacas demonstrated the organism in 36% of animals. Four of the five affected females were bred and became pregnant within 31 and 150 days of abortion. In sheep, it has been demonstrated that infection results in protective immunity for several years; it is not known if this occurs in camelids. Differentials for late-term abortion in camelids with placental lesions and exposure to sheep should include C. fetus, although further investigation into this pathogen in these species is warranted. However, it is important to differentiate abortion caused by Campylobacter spp. from those caused by Campylobacter-like organisms such as Arcobacter spp., which has also been isolated from an alpaca abortus.35\n",

Induction of abortion is sometimes warranted for management or medical reasons. Administration of cloprostenol (250 micrograms [mcg], intramuscularly [IM]) twice with a 24-hour interval has been shown to reliably induce abortion between 4 and 7 months of pregnancy. The majority (92.5%) of animals aborted 3 days (45.2%) or 4 days (37.7%) following a single series of injections.

Altrenogest, a progestogen commonly used for maintenance of pregnancy in mares, is not active orally in camelids. Progesterone in oil needs to be administered frequently. The most common treatment for maintenance of pregnancy in cases of suspected hypoluteoidism is the administration of hydroxyprogesterone caproate (250 mg, IM, every 3 weeks). Treatment should be stopped at 300 days to allow normal parturition. Long-term treatment with progestogen is associated with a high risk of failure of cervical dilation. We recommend that any female that is placed on progesterone supplementation therapy during pregnancy be frequently evaluated with ultrasonography to assess fetal development and viability. The use of progesterone therapy in maiden females for maintenance of pregnancy should be discouraged. It is possible that the syndrome of hypoluteoidism may be associated with other metabolic or hormonal disturbances (hypothyroidism). Most cases seen in our clinic are obese females.",

Similar mechanisms are suspected in alpacas and llamas, which is why many producers choose to breed their female animals in the spring or fall to avoid early fetal development and possible pregnancy loss during the hottest days of summer. Stress from travel by trailer for as little as 30 minutes resulted in increased cortisol levels in alpacas for several hours.57 Systemic disease may also result in pregnancy loss; production of cortisol may be implicated (especially if the animal is moved to a veterinary clinic, is stabled alone, is handled often, or undergoes multiple treatments, anesthesia, or both); or the pregnant female may be so debilitated that in an effort to meet her own metabolic needs the pregnancy is self-terminated.

We have seen cases of self-reduced twin pregnancy in which the retained fetus was in the right horn of the dam's uterus. Such cases should be flagged by the veterinarian as high-risk pregnancies, as the right horn is typically smaller, and an increased risk for late abortion may exist. Despite the tendency for early self-reduction, cases of aborted twin fetuses later in gestation have been reported; this highlights the need for early and accurate diagnosis. Pregnancy diagnosis should not be limited to a checkup if the female is pregnant but should include evaluation of the size of the embryonic vesicle, examination of both uterine horns, and, most importantly, examination of both ovaries for quality and number of corpora lutea. Anytime a double ovulation (two corpora lutea) is identified in the pregnancy diagnosis at 14 days, the females should be closely monitored for presence of twins and their location. This can be easily done by detection of two fetal heart beats or concepti proper by day 25. Our recommendation is to eliminate both twins if they are bilateral. If the twins are unilateral, another evaluation is scheduled between 30 and 45 days of pregnancy. If the pregnancy is not reduced to a singleton by this time, a decision to abort both should be considered. Termination of pregnancy is reliably achieved by administration of two doses of cloprostenol (250 mcg, IM) with a 24-hour interval. Abortion at this stage of pregnancy does not have any effect on the welfare and future fertility of the dam compared with late-term abortion or even the birth of twins, which may cause dystocia and damage to the cervix.2 The twins are generally aborted anytime during mid- to late pregnancy in various degrees of autolysis (most of the cases we have observed are between 4 and 7 months). They are usually of unequal size and smaller than the normal gestation age (Figure 23-5\n). Although rare, conjoined twins are possible and may cause dystocia during abortion (Figure 23-6\n). Birth of a normal cria with the mummified remains of a twin is possible. Females with recurrent twinning on consecutive cycles after abortion have been documented (Dietrich Volkmann, personal communication). In these cases, monitoring of follicular dynamics and reduction of nutritional plan may help reduce the chances of double ovulation. Unfortunately, no easy techniques exist for manual reduction of twins.",

The rolling behavior of the dam and the size of the fetus are often cited as the main contributing factors. A tendency towards increased incidence during the summer months is suspected to be related to increased dusting behavior. It is interesting to note that uterine torsion is rarely mentioned in the South American literature as a significant problem compared with North America and Australia. This geographic difference may be explained by the small birth weights and smaller body size of alpacas in South America. Another major difference is the extreme variation in the duration of pregnancy in llamas and alpacas observed outside of South America, which may be a contributing factor.",

Fetal movements and rolling of the dam may contribute to the final stages of torsion. Females may have decreased appetite, visit the manure pile frequently, quick at her abdomen, or lie in lateral recumbency. In advanced cases, depression, diarrhea, and anorexia may be the only clinical signs. Astute producers may notice a slight listlessness and less activity than normal. If the torsion is slight, often the female will not show signs of debilitation as the uterine vasculature will continue to supply the organ. The female may continue to eat and defecate normally. In severe torsions, the uterine vasculature may become occluded, leading to compromise of the uterus and the fetus. Additionally, the more severe the rotation, the more tension is placed on the broad ligament, which will cause more severe pain and clinical signs in the animal. The female may show tachycardia, tachypnea, and increased vocalization.

Sedation and or epidural anesthesia may be required for palpation per rectum. Most uterine torsions in camelids are precervical in nature, and a vaginal examination either by palpation or speculum will not demonstrate any spiraling of the vagina. Therefore, the most definitive means of diagnosis is palpation of the broad ligaments, noting the degree of tension and location of the fetus. The location of the fetus is often more cranial than normal and difficult to palpate. In clockwise torsion, the left broad ligament stretches diagonally from the left side to the right side of the animal as a tight band running over the uterine body, whereas the right broad ligament is shorter and trapped under the body of the uterus (Figure 23-11\n). Determination of the direction of the torsion may be very difficult in some situations, and exploratory laparotomy should be performed in these cases. Camelids ovulate equally from both ovaries but only carry their fetus in the left uterine horn. This has been proposed as the main reason for a higher incidence of clockwise uterine torsion in alpacas and llamas.65 However, a significant number of counterclockwise torsion still occurs.63, 64 The occurrence of counterclockwise torsion cannot be explained by pregnancies in the right horn. However, we have observed an abnormal fetal position in several cases of term uterine torsion, which suggests that this may be a factor.",

Fetal viability may be ascertained by identifying the fetal heart, and fetal heart rate may give indications as to the health of the fetus.61 Fetal heart rates greater than 130 beats per minute (beats/min) may indicate fetal stress, and rates less than 50 beats/min may encourage the practitioner to consider cesarean section immediately and bypass any attempts to roll the alpaca to correct the torsion. Ultrasonographic examination of the uterus and the placenta will also yield important information about the health of the uterus and the pregnancy. A severe or chronic uterine torsion will lead to increased uterine wall thickness and, if the female is in active labor, potentially placental separation (Figure 23-12\n). Measurements of the uterine wall may dictate whether rolling of the dam poses a substantial risk for uterine rupture, as thickened walls may be edematous or friable. In most cases of mild to moderate uterine torsion with normal fetal heart rates and normal uterine wall appearance and thickness on ultrasonographic examination, rolling the female is a viable first option for treatment. Most new portable ultrasound machines are equipped with color Doppler imaging. This feature is extremely important for the evaluation of uterine perfusion but most importantly of fetal viability, as it is often very difficult to ascertain fetal death. If the heart is not accessible, the clinician may use Doppler ultrasound on fetal aorta or richly vascularized organs such as the liver or the kidney.

Nonsurgical treatment comprises rolling the female while holding the fetus and uterus stationary in the abdomen. Debilitated females may not be good candidates for rolling because of the risk of uterine rupture. If the female is slightly dulled but not overly debilitated and the uterus has a normal appearance on ultrasonographic examination, it may be possible to roll the female without chemical restraint. However, if she is bright, a risk to handlers of being kicked exists. If the female's abdomen is not relaxed enough to palpate the fetus, often intramuscular butorphanol is administered to facilitate the procedure. It is crucial to accurately diagnose the direction of torsion, as this will dictate the direction of rolling. Females are rolled in the same direction as that of the torsion. For clockwise torsions, the female is placed on the ground in right lateral recumbency. In field-settings, a grass pasture or lawn is ideal; in hospital settings, a padded floor or mat may be used. Three to four people are required for a safe, successful rolling attempt. One person controls the head and neck to prevent injury to the female. Often placing a towel over the female's eyes calms the animal. Another person controls the front limbs and shoulder, and the third person controls the hindlimbs and hips. The person guiding the rolling process uses hand pressure to stabilize the fetus and the uterus of the female. As the female is rolled from right lateral to dorsal to left lateral to sternal recumbency, the person manipulating the fetus will attempt to hold the fetus stationary as the female rolls around it. This may be accomplished by the handler using just the hands or sometimes the hand on top and the knee on the side. The handler may feel the fetus slip as the torsion resolves or partially resolves. Once rolled to sternal recumbency, the female is repositioned as before and rolled again in the same manner. This process is repeated three to four times, and the female is then placed in sternal position and examined via transrectal palpation. Successful correction is recognized by easy identification of both broad ligaments and easy access to the uterus and the fetus. It is not possible to overroll the animal and cause a uterine torsion in the opposite direction. In large llamas, the procedure is similar, but heavy sedation of the animal is required. The use of a plank to hold the fetus in place is more practical for rolling llamas. Correction should not take more than four or five rolling attempts. The most critical aspect of correction of uterine torsion by rolling is to roll the female slowly, making sure that the fetus is always held firmly in place.",

            "text": "The surgical approach should be considered if the rolling is not successful or if the female is increasingly uncomfortable. Surgical treatment options are based on the stage of pregnancy at which the uterine torsion occurs and the size of the animal. If the fetus is at term or severely compromised or if the female is debilitated, a cesarean section may be warranted. Surgical correction should also be attempted when the diagnosis is made by exploratory laparotomy. The uterus may be gently rolled within the abdomen via a midline incision. Flooding the abdominal cavity with lactated Ringer solution helps with the correction. In the llama, surgical approaches to the gravid uterus include a ventral midline celiotomy and a left flank laparotomy.63 Flank laparotomy may be more advantageous in larger debilitated animals or in field settings. In the alpaca, ventral midline celiotomy is the preferred approach, although in debilitated animals, respiratory failure is a significant risk because of the small lung field in these species and the biomechanics involved when the animal is placed in dorsal recumbency. Care must be taken when detorsing the uterus, as it may be edematous and friable, even if not noted on ultrasonographic examination. Manipulation of the uterus should be minimal and done with care, especially if the fetus is pre-term. The surgeon should palpate the broad ligaments directly and determine or confirm the direction of torsion. In the midline approach, correction is relatively easy. The surgeon should hold the tip of the pregnant horn and the fetal part engaged with it firmly with one hand while holding the rest of the fetal body and uterus by placing pressure on them with the flat hand. The fetus is then rocked against the direction of the torsion. In severe torsion, this may need to be done in two steps. For flank correction, the incision should allow the surgeon to use two hands. The fetus is rotated by gently pushing against the direction of the torsion with one hand while the other hand pulls the fetus and pregnant horn.",

In our hands, rolling carries better prognosis for nonterm torsion, whereas cesarean delivery in term cases is better for the survival of the cria.64 However, the decision to deliver the fetus by cesarean section should not be based on pregnancy duration only. The best prognosis for survival is when the mammary glands are well developed and colostrum is present. Our protocol for handling these cases is summarized in Figure 23-13\n. Crias delivered by cesarean section often need resuscitation, and therefore, surgery should only be contemplated if intensive care can be provided immediately. Unattended or improperly handled uterine torsions may have catastrophic repercussions on the dam, including uterine rupture, peritonitis, and hemorrhage. Splenic torsion concurrent with uterine torsion has been described in one case with persistent pain following correction.66\n",
