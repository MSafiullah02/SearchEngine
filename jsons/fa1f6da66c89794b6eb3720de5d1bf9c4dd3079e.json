Also, serum IL-6 was significantly higher in the TOCI group, thus reflecting the very high inflammatory state of those patients at baseline. Very recently, IL-6 serum levels were also closely correlated with viral load in critically ill patients and it is important to point out that all our patients belonging to TOCI group received anti-viral agents [17] . Notably, baseline CRP and IL-6 continued to distinguish the two groups (TOCI versus SOC) even after excluding the most seriously ill patients from analyses. Thus, these biomarkers could useful for decision making. Notably, a higher NLR, as well as a higher monocyte to lymphocyte ratio, have been associated with mortality and imaging progression in hospitalized patients for COVID-19 [18] [19] [20] .

Tocilizumab use prior to ventilation in ICU may be optimal since 50% of such cases died, remain ventilated and show serious superinfection. Whether the use of tocilizumab J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f prior to ventilation will be vindicated in randomized trials is of major interest. Our findings also showed that cases receiving tocilizumab on ventilation generally had higher levels of inflammation than non-ventilated TOCI treated subjects, possibly suggesting that the latter group has an intrinsically milder disease with a better prognosis. Timing of anti-cytokine therapy is a key issue.",
