Generally outbreak means a \u201csudden occurrence,\u201d while in the epidemiological sense an outbreak is defined as a sudden increase in the disease frequency, related to time, place, and observed population. Thousands of outbreaks among humans and animals have been reported and investigated during the last two centuries, among them the most numerous being outbreaks of cholera, plague, malaria, smallpox, influenza, SARS, measles, salmonella, chikungunya, and various foodborne outbreaks.",

Furthermore, the increasing density of populations, growing megacities in the developing world, an increasing number of subpopulations at risk, and other socio-demographical factors influence the way communicable diseases spread (see 10.1007/978-0-387-93835-6_2).

For instance, a cluster of five cases with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) was identified in one community in southwest France in 2005. The outbreak investigation showed that all patients had consumed one brand of frozen beef burgers in the week before the onset of symptom. Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli 0157:H7) was identified as the cause of the disease (King et al. 2008). An outbreak investigation should also take place even if only one case of an unknown or an unusual disease occurs and if this disease is life threatening [e.g., avian flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)] (Timmreck 1994).",

Next, outbreak investigations often result in discovering new infections and diseases.

Possible biases which can influence the evaluation of an outbreak must be taken into account; first of all, changes in reporting practices, changes in population size, improved diagnostic procedures or screening campaigns (detection bias), or increased interest of the public and media in certain diseases (Gerstman 2003). Often it might also be helpful to interview several representative cases. That can help to understand the clinical picture of the disease and obtain additional information about the affected individuals. The collection of epidemiological data is important for the development of prevention and control measures.

Examples A and B represent an epidemic curve for a propagated (continuing or progressive) source outbreak. Propagated outbreaks depend on transmission from person to person or continuing exposure from a single source (Gerstman 2003). Curve A illustrates an outbreak (e.g., measles, influenza, or chickenpox) with a single exposure and index cases (index cases are those that first come to the attention of public health authorities) (Friis and Sellers 2004). Curve B shows the incidence of secondary and tertiary cases, typical, for example, for hepatitis A (secondary cases are those who acquire disease from contact with primary cases and tertiary cases are those who acquire disease from contact with secondary cases). In such a propagated outbreak, as it is shown in part B, there first occurs an increase in cases after exposure, then a fall in the incidence of cases; later there occurs a second increase in cases eventually infected by person-to-person transmission from primary cases. Curves C and D of Fig. 9.2 are examples of common source outbreaks. In such outbreaks most cases are exposed to one risk factor. Part C is a possible example for an outbreak when the number of cases rises suddenly and then slowly falls again. This is characteristic of a common source outbreak with a point exposure when the population at risk is exposed simultaneously within a short period of time. In this instance the epidemic ends, unless secondary cases occur, which is typical for foodborne outbreaks. Another example of the point source outbreak is Legionnaires\u2019 disease, which broke out among people who attended a convention of the American Legion in Philadelphia in 1976 (Arias 2000).\n\n",

It is practical to present geographical information in the form of maps, for example, dot density maps and choropleth maps. Dot density maps may serve to graphically present the geographical extent of the problem and provide information on clustering. Probably the most famous dot density map was drawn by John Snow, showing the cholera deaths near the Golden Square in London (where the outbreak occurred) in 1854 (McLeod 2001). From his map, one could recognize the connection between clustering of cholera cases around the Broad Street pump, thus, the water-borne nature of the infectious agent (Gerstman 2003). However, the disadvantage of dot density maps is that they do not provide any information concerning the number of people at risk in a mapped area, which can be confusing when populations of these areas are unequal in size. Another option is to build a map, which shows area-specific disease rates, for example, disease attack rates per 100 inhabitants showing epicenters of an epidemic.",
