We therefore a-priori planned a subgroup analysis excluding children who were taking macrolide antibiotics. This subgroup analysis was included in the statistical analysis plan approved by the data safety monitoring committee. In the Bronchiectasis Exacerbation Study, BEST-2, there were 97 children taking long-term antibiotics at baseline. Of these, 30 were receiving co-trimoxazole and the remaining 67 were taking one of the macrolides at baseline. Of these 67 children, 45 were identified as receiving long-term (>4-weeks) macrolide antibiotics when they were randomised at the beginning of an exacerbation. These children were excluded and the analyses for primary and secondary outcomes were repeated in the remaining 134 children (Supplement Figure 1 ) using similar statistical methods as described in the main manuscript.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 200, "end": 202, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 203, "end": 204, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1039, "end": 1047, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Sensitivity analysis"}, {"text": "By day-21, 58 (75\u00b73%) participants randomised to the amoxicillin-clavulanate study arm and not taking long-term macrolides returned to their baseline state compared to 44 (77\u00b71%) in the azithromycin arm who also were not receiving these antibiotics long-term. The risk difference (RD) for resolution in the azithromycin compared to the amoxicillinclavulanate group was 0\u00b78% in the per-protocol (PP) population (n=121) (95% confidence interval (CI) -1\u00b75, 14\u00b72), thereby falling within the a-priori calculated 20% non-inferiority margin, (Supplement Figure 2) and reaffirmed by the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (n=134) 1\u00b78% (95%CI -12\u00b76, 16\u00b74).

There was no difference in median time-to-the next exacerbation between the two groups (Supplement Table 1 ). There were no significant between-group differences in alterations to the parent cough-specific quality-of-life score, inflammatory markers and spirometry parameters in the children where these data were available on day-1 and day-21 in either the PP or ITT analyses.
