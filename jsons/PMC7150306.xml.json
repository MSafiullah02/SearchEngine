In many cases, localized outbreaks occur [1], [2], [3], [4] that can lead to occasional, large scale epidemics and pandemics [5], [6], [7], [8]. A well-known example of an emerging virus resulting in a pandemic is the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). After jumping to humans from chimpanzees in Cameroon [9], this virus was able to maintain sustained, undetected person-to-person transmission in Kinshasa in the 1920s due to a variety of factors including high population densities [10]. The mobility of the population by well-connected railways allowed the virus to spread within Africa, and changing social behaviors such as injectable drug use and the sex trade allowed the virus to explode into a pandemic [10].",

In both of these cases, numerous factors had a role in enabling the rapid viral transmission of previously isolated infectious diseases. Besides increasing population density and ease of transportation, climate and ecological changes that expand a vector's range or habitat can lead to novel epidemics. For example, infections of Lassa virus, spread by the Mastomys natalensis rat, are increased in West Africa during the dry seasons when the rats are more likely to be inside individuals' houses [21].",

Taxonomic placement of viruses is problematic due to the lack of universal genes, such as the bacterial 16S RNA gene, limiting classification to viruses with defined biological characteristics [34]. In fact a mere 5000 total species are currently classified by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) which pales in comparison to the estimated 320,000 viral species infecting mammals alone [35]. Metagenomic sequencing has highlighted this significant gap in classified vs unknown viromes, and while biological characterization will not also always be defined, knowledge can be gained from genomic sequences including evolutionary relationships and genome structure [34]. Continuing to gather viral genomic information from environmental, plant, and animal samples will continue to fill gaps in our knowledge base and further prepare us for detecting and predicting emerging pathogens.",

Unbiased pyrosequencing of RNA extracts from human samples identified approximately 50% of an arenavirus genome which was thereafter gap filled using primers designed off the sequenced genome. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the identification of a novel Old World arenavirus [31]. Similarly, deep sequencing identified Bas-Congo virus, of a novel rhabdovirus, in three human cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo [30]. This virus was associated with high fever and rapid death and was found to have only 34% amino-acid identity with other rhabdoviruses. The discovery and characterization of these viruses has allowed novel diagnostics to be developed, including real-time PCR, leading to a better preparedness for future outbreaks.",
