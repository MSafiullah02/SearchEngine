Some scientists believe this behavior leads to new illnesses being formed by genetic mutation crossing the species barrier and entering the human population. However, the Chinese authorities failed to alert any Chinese farmhands feed their animals with garbage purchased from restaurants. Chickens also have free run of the farm and crowd the troughs for their share of the food. Unfinished food from last night's meal, including clam shells and other seafood leftovers, still litter the ground. Many livestock farms in southern China's Guangdong province are not licensed by the local authorities. However, unregulated farms are not the only places where people and animals live close together in China. In many restaurants, there is the zoo-like stench. Animal cages are stacked in the doorway and hold whatever happens to be on the evening's menu, snake, chicken, duck, rabbit, even a black kitten (Schafer and Guterl, 2003) . South China has long practiced this unique traditional form of agriculture, which places pigs and ducks in close contact. This close contact may facilitate the development of new influenza strains by placing ducks, which are the reservoir of influenza diversity, and pigs, which are the possible mixing vessels for mammalian influenza strains, in close proximity with each other and with humans (Morse, 2003) .",

The influenza pandemic of 1918, which killed 20 million people, makes the current SARS epidemic minor by comparison. If reporting and environmental conditions do not change, China will only continue to export new pathogens. And as the genetic dice continue to roll, the likelihood of a truly devastating new disease continues to increase. The first step to preventing the next outbreak, of course, is figuring out what caused this one. The leading theory is that SARS originated, like most influenza viruses, in aquatic birds (ducks, perhaps) and then made the jump to humans (Schafer and Guterl, 2003) .",

The economies of Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand have not just abruptly stopped growing, but they either experienced a SARS-induced decline or stagnation. Even China's booming industrial expansion slowed under the weight of SARS . Analysts across the region are forecasting losses approaching the magnitude of the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis. BNP Paribas downgraded its 2003 gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for eight Asian countries by 0.4 to 1.5 percent. Goldman Sachs also warned that losses in Hong Kong could reach 31%, in Singapore 26%, in Taiwan 20% and in Thailand 15% of their GDP in the second quarter of 2003, or around $38 billion just in those four economies. Thus, Beijing's mismanagement of the outbreak could undermine investors' trust in the world's fastest-growing economy (Wehrfritz and Seno, 2003) .",

Metrojet, which operates two jets out of Hong Kong's International Airport, has seen inquiries double and new clients grow by 30%. Destinations also have changed.

SARS emerged in China in November 2002 and has spread to 26 countries. It was not until February 2003, three months after the first SARS cases were identified, that China admitted that there was an outbreak. Then, for a month after that, the Chinese government assured the world authorities' that the epidemic was under control. Finally, after a global outcry, China began slowly releasing information in April and gave the WHO team approval to travel in the country.",
