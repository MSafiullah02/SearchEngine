After 5-14 days in-hospital treatment, the counts of T lymphocyte subsets slightly increased than disease onset (Figure 2A).

Meanwhile, as the severity of illness getting worse, the concentrations of inflammatory cytokines getting higher. The median concentration of SAA in critically-ill patients was nearly 4-fold to that of mild-ill patients. The median concentration of CRP in critically-ill patients was nearly 10-fold to that of mild-ill patients. Lower counts (/uL) of T lymphocytesubsets lymphocyte (<500), CD3+T-cell (<200), CD4+ T-cell (<100), CD8+ T-cell (<100), and B-cell (<50) were associated with higher risk of in-hospital death. The warning values of lymphocyte, CD3+ T-cell, CD4+ T-cell, CD8+ T-cell, and B-cell were 559, 235, 104, 85 and 82, respectively. T cell-mediated immunity is the central element of the adaptive immune system and includes a primary response by na\u00efve T cells. Each T lymphocyte expresses a unique T cell receptor (TCR) on the surface 14 . Mature T lymphocytes known as na\u00efve T cells, circulate through blood and the lymphatic system and reside in secondary lymphoid organs 15 . All T lymphocytes have the T-cell receptor (TCR) and pan-T-cell co-receptor CD3. CD4+ T cells recognize MHC 1 bound antigens, while CD8+ T cells recognize the MHC 1 bound antigens. Both CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells have the co-receptor CD3. And the sum total counts of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ cells are almost equal to or slightly more than CD3+ cells. Damage to T lymphocytes, impressed immunity and related high levels of inflammatory cytokines might be important factor to exacerbation and mortality of patients. Previous SARS-COV infection stimulated cytokines IL-1, IL-10 etc., and T lymphocyte subsets CD4+T-cell and CD8+T-cell were decreased after onset of the disease as well 16 . T-cell mediated immunity is an adaptive process of developing antigen-(Ag) specific T lymphocytes to eliminate SARS-COV-2 invasion. Since CD4+ T cells are central in the origin and regulation of autoimmunity, emphasis has been placed on the characterization of Th subsets and their possible roles in the inflammatory process. IL-1\u03b2 serves as the major mediator of inflammatory diseases, including autoimmune, infectious and degenerative ones. In the central nervous system (CNS), it acts as endogenous pyrogen inducing fever, and systemically, it induces the acute phase response, either directly or indirectly via the induction of IL-6 production. IL-6 is one of the key mediators regulating inflammation. Upon activation by infectious agents like SARS-COV-2, IL-6 is produced by macrophages, endothelial cells, and T cells and activate many tissue cells, including endothelial cells and parenchymal cells to produce effector molecules of inflammation 17 . IL-10 is mainly produced by monocytes and T cells and the most potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, which reduces inflammatory processes and thus limits collateral inflammation-induced tissue damage 18 19 . On one hand, SARS-COV-2 invasion activated T cell-mediated immunity which resulted in increasing production of inflammatory cytokine. However, inhibition cytokines such as IL-10 can suppress T cell activation conversely. On the other hand, SAA and CRP are both of acute-phase proteins in response to inflammatory cytokines related by activated monocytes/macrophages after infections. High levels of SAA and CRP could reflect the severity of inflammation and result in a \"cytokine storm\", during which inflammation spreads throughout the body via the circulation. Several studies revealed that a substantial decrease in total number of lymphocytes indicates that coronavirus consumes many immune cells and inhibits the body's cellular immune function 20 21 . SARS causes similar decrease of T lymphocyte, severe lung injury and spleen shrinkage, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 22-24 . Until now, no antiviral treatment for coronavirus infection has been proven to be effective. Now, we faced on urgent need to elucidate what are the risk factors for severe illness or death. Therefore, our study tries to partly answer this question to help with the clinical practice and better know this disease.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "subsets and its possible association to in-hospital death and severity of COVID-19. In addition, we assessed and analyzed inflammatory cytokines produced by T cells on admission. In summary, we find a significant decrease of T lymphocyte subset is positive correlated with in-hospital death and severity of illness. Lower counts (/uL) of T lymphocyte subsets lymphocyte (<500), CD3+T-cell (<200), CD4+ T-cell (<100), CD8+ T-cell (<100) and B-cell(<50) counts were exhibited higher risk of in-hospital death.

The decrease levels of T lymphocyte subsets reported in our study were not common among other virus infection, which may be a possible biomarker for early diagnosis. Our findings may shed light on early warning of high risk of mortality and help early intervention and treatment.
