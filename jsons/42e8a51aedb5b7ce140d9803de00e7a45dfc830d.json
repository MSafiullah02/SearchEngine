It has been identified to increase permeability of the lipid membrane for cations. Permeability is suggested to occur due to the assembly of helical bundles. Computational models of a pentameric assembly of 8a peptides are generated using the first 22 amino acids, which include the transmembrane domain. Low energy structures reveal a hydrophilic pore mantled by residues Thr-8, and 218, Ser-11, Cys-13, and Arg-22. Potential of mean force (PMF) profiles for mono (Na 1 , K 1 , Cl 2 ) and divalent (Ca 21 ) ions along the pore are calculated. The data support experimental findings of a weak cation selectivity of the channel. Calculations on 8a are compared to data derived for a pentameric bundle consisting of the M2 helices of the bacterial pentameric ligand gated ion channel GLIC (3EHZ). PMF curves of both, bundles 8a and M2, show sigmoidal shaped profiles. In comparison to the data for the M2-GLIC model, data of the 8a bundle show lower amplitude of the PMF values between maximum and minimum and less discrimination amongst ions.",

VCPs are found in many enveloped and naked human viruses as well as in plant viruses. [20] [21] [22] Generally they are about 100 amino acids in length, with the exception of 3a from SARS-CoV, which is found to be made of 274 amino acids. In many cases, the role of the VCPs in the infectivity cycle of the virus is not univocally established. Up to now, structural investigations of individual VCPs reveal, that they adopt a helical motif to span the bilayer, which is also supported by secondary structure prediction programs. On the basis of the latter, 8a has been simulated using a helical motif for its transmembrane domain (TMD). 16 Furthermore, it has been suggested, that a pentameric assembly forms the most plausible bundle model.

The RMSD values for the simulation level off after 40 ns [Fig. 2(B), left, black line]. The RMSF values of all the 5 helices reveal the loss of the dynamic (wshape) center of the TMDs [Fig. 2(B), right]. Averaged kink and tilt angles from the data of the individual TMDs of the bundle are calculated as (11.9 6 2.7) and (30.6 6 1.9) , respectively (Table I, 0 mV). Short equilibration of the GLIC bundle over 20 ns leads to a stable structure after 5 ns, shown by a leveling-off of the RMSD values beyond this time [Fig. 2(C), left]. The RMSF values for almost all residues remain at or below 0.1 nm [Fig. 2(C), right]. The bundle under applied voltage Application of voltage [15 mV (blue lines), 30 mV (green lines), 45 mV (pink lines)] during the simulation of the bundle-lipid system embedded into a 150 mM solution leads to equilibrated structures [see RMSD values in Fig. 2(B), left] after around 30 ns. Lipid thickness is calculated to be around 35 \u00c5 [e.g., (35.2 6 1.2) \u00c5 at 15 mV and (35.1 6 1.5) \u00c5 at 45 mV] and the area per lipid is calculated to be of 74-75 \u00c5 2 [e.g., (75.5 6 0.0) \u00c5 2 at 15 mV and (74.4 6 0.0) \u00c5 2 at 45 mV].
