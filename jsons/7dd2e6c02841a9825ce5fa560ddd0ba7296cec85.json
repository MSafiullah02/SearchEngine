While much has been written about how this novel methodology will contribute to scientific inquiry, no literature yet exists on how these advances will affect hospitalistsspecialists in inpatient medicinewho care exclusively for hospitalized patients suffering from a variety of maladies [4] [5] [6] . This paper reviews the potential of the CRISPR platform and explores how this technology may soon impact the field of Hospital Medicine, which has emerged as the fastest growing subspecialty in the history of medicine [7] . It concludes with a look at ethical issues and technical hurdles pertaining to the implementation of permanent gene modification in clinical practice.",

Hospitalists care for a broad array of medical maladies, ranging from blood clots to pneumonia, and emerging research suggests that many of the medical conditions under the hospitalist's purview could be influenced by advances in the CRISPR-Cas9 [19, 20] . Given the rapid evolution of this technology and the widespread appreciation of its potential to alter the treatment of disease, it is necessary for hospitalists to be familiar with the relevance of CRISPR-Cas9. An overview of the most common conditions cared for by hospitalists is provided below followed by an examination of how management of these diseases may change with advances in somatic and germline gene modification [21] .",

For purposes of pathogen detection, cleavage of a labeled sing-strand RNA or DNA probe generates a signal that can provide a fluorescent readout in a number of portable formats, including the use of disposable paper strips, enabling rapid detection of pathogenic viruses [29] . CRISPR-based tests carry several advantages over traditional microbiological diagnostics such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which is generally considered to be the most sensitive and specific test available for viral detection. However, PCR require multiple steps to run the assay, including an upfront nucleic acid extraction and amplification steps, and require dedicated instrumentation [30] [31] [32] . By contrast, CRISPR-Cas-based assays can be run directly on primary clinical samples as a single reaction and performed using minimal equipment [33] [34] [35] [36] . This is especially relevant for detection of SARS-CoV-2, where testing has been limited in many places due to a lack of testing materials and personal protective equipment [37] [38] [39] .",

But these opportunities must be weighed against potential downstream effects. CRISRP-based platforms have the potential to alter microbiota, which can be associated with adverse health events [106, 107] . It will be crucial for hospitalists, who often care for these patients, to take a more involved role in this aspect of clinical research as CRISPR-based approaches will undoubtedly affect many of their patients in the years to come.",
