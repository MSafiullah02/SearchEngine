In contrast, other studies show that coinfection is a risk factor for poor progress.14, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 One of the most important of these was performed in Vienna by Aberle et al.,14 between 2000 and 2004. They reported that airway obstruction was more severe when RSV contributed to the coinfection, and mean hospital stay lengthened if rhinovirus was involved. In another study, Grensill et al.26 showed that when the coinfection consisted of RSV and metapneumovirus, progress was poorer. Furthermore, Richard et al.,28 who studied the relationship of coinfection with need for PICU admission, concluded that the presence of two or more viruses increased the likelihood of PICU admission 2.7-fold. However, in another study conducted in patients admitted to the PICU, Ghani et al.29 found that only bacterial confection was associated with a longer hospital stay, with no increase in mortality.",
