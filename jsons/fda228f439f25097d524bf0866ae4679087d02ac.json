The Zika Pandemic. Most of the world's populations are living in endemic areas for common mosquito-borne diseases. The Zika pandemic between the years of 2015 and 2016 marked the largest known outbreak, reaching a \"red-alert\" warning of multiple complications requiring global public health interventions. In such exigencies, population health behaviors are important for potential control measures. Daughton and Paul postulated that internet data has been effective to track human health seeking behaviors during disease outbreaks [12] . They used Twitter data between 2015 and 2016 respectively to identify and describe self-disclosures of an individual's behavior change during disease spread. They combined keyword filtering and ML classifications to identify first-person reactions to Zika. A total of 29,386 English tweets were analyzed. Keywords include \"travel,\" \"travelling intentions,\" and \"cancellations.\" Individual demographic characteristics, users' networking and linguistic patterns were compared with controls. The study found variations between individual characteristics, users' social network attributes and language styles in 1567 Twitter users. These users changed or considered to change their travel behaviors in response to Zika.

Further, the rapidly expanding mobile phone penetrance, developments in cloud computing, substantial investments in health informatics, electronic medical records (EMRs) and mobile health (mHealth) applications, even in resource-constrained settings, holds significant promise for increasing use and scalability of AI applications in improving public health outcomes [35] . Public health policy, practice and research will continue to benefit from the expanding framework of infodemiology and infoveillance in analyzing health information search, communication and publication behavior on the internet [23, 24] . Advances in cryptographic technologies-including block chain is likely to allay fears and concerns with security, privacy and confidentiality of public digital data/information [36] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 577, "end": 581, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 951, "end": 955, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1186, "end": 1190, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1191, "end": 1194, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1374, "end": 1378, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Opportunities and Future Direction of AI Applications During Disease Epidemics"}, {"text": "There is no doubt that AI is and will continue to revolutionize healthcare and population health.
