It has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization which exhibited human-to-human transmissibility and spread rapidly across countries [1]. Although Chinese government has taken various measures to control city-to-city transmission (e.g. shutting down cities, extending holidays) and many countries have implemented measures such as airport screening and testing of patients who have reported symptoms, the number of cases still increases quickly throughout the world.",

For example, a sharp change of ambient temperature was associated with increased risk of SARS [2, 3]. Also, influenza transmission is often enhanced in the presence of cold and/or dry air [4]. In northern Europe, low temperature and low UV Indexes were correlated with peaks of influenza virus activity during 2010\u20132018 [5]. Therefore, it is hypothesised that COVID-19 transmission may decrease or even disappear when the temperature and UV radiation increase in the summer. In this study, we aim to determine the association of meteorological factors with transmission of COVID-19 in various Chinese cities.",

R0 means the expected number of secondary cases generated by an initial infectious individual, in a completely susceptible population. If R0<1, then the disease free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable; whereas if R0>1, then it is unstable. Thus, R0 is a threshold parameter.",

Reports of UV and respiratory diseases have also been studied, and previous studies have shown that high levels of UV exposure can reduce the spread of SARS-COV virus [9].",

According to the current results, cumulative incidence rate and R0 of COVID-19 held no significant associations with ambient temperature, suggesting that ambient temperature has no significant impact on the transmission ability of SARS-CoV-2. This is quite similar with MERS epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula where MERS cases continue when temperatures are 45\u00b0C [10]. Other newly emergent zoonotic disease, such as Ebola or pandemic strains of influenza, have also occurred in unpredictable patterns. Even though the transmission of SARS, which began in November, 2002, and ended in July, 2003, suggests it might be seasonal, but it also might have been controlled by effective case finding, contact tracing and quarantine.",

Certainly, further studies with longer follow-up period and wider temperature range are warranted. Second, given the ecological nature of study, other city-level factors, such as implementation ability of COVID-19 control policy, urbanisation rate, and availability of medical resources, may affect the transmissibility of COVID-19 and confound our findings. Future studies should develop complicated models with high spatial-temporal resolution to assess the relationship between meteorological conditions and epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19.",
