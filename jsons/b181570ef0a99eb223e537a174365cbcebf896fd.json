A common initial response of the Golgi apparatus to any stress is a n alteration or cessation of secretory activity. In the transformed cell, the Golgi apparatus is altered both morphologically and biochemically, suggesting a shift from a secretory to a membrane-generating mode of functioning. However, since fewer or less well-developed Golgi apparatus are frequently found in transformed cells, analytical methods of membrane isolation developed for normal tissues may not always yield equivalent results when applied to tumors. Cell surface alterations characteristic of malignant cells may result from modifications occurring a t the level of the Golgi apparatus. Some lysosomal dysfunctions may result from underglycosylation of acid hydrolases by the Golgi apparatus. The use of cell-free systems between endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus or within Golgi apparatus cisterane is providing a new approach to the elucidation of the role of the Golgi apparatus in normal as well as pathological states.",

It is involved as well in the processing of membrane proteins and glycoproteins (Farquhar, 1985; Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985) and in the formation of lysosomes (Creek and Sly, 1984; Farquhar, 1985) ; where dysfunction may result in a variety of disorders. Analysis is complicated by the organization of the Golgi apparatus as a series of different membrane compartments through which proteins move sequentially on their way either to the plasma membrane or to lysosomes (Pfeffer and Rothman, 1987) . The cisternal membranes within the Golgi apparatus show a gradient from rough endoplasmic reticulum-like a t the forming face to plasma membranelike at the mature face (Mollenhauer and Morre, 1991) . Although the Golgi apparatus is best characterized as a compartment of the secretory route, it may also act as an intermediary in the endocytic route (Klausner, 1989) .",

Disorders in which one or more specific glycosyltransferases, normally located exclusively or at least predominantly in the Golgi apparatus, are either overexpressed or underexpressed prob-ably are the best candidates. In most examples, the Golgi apparatus response is through its functional role as a n intermediary in membrane flow from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane (i.e., expression of viral antigens) in the processing and packaging of lysosomal enzymes (i.e., inheritable storage disorders), or in processing and packaging of secretory materials for export out of the cell (i.e., hyperlipoproteinemia). In these examples, Golgi apparatus involvement in disease etiology is most likely secondary but nonetheless important to the overall expression of the pathologic phenotype. A fundamental problem is that diseases are generally characterized and diagnosed by end product abnormalities (e.g., secretionistorage diseases, lysosomal diseases) rather than by intermediate product alterations that, nonetheless, may be the primary contributing factor to the disease.",

            "text": "One of the best studied examples of pathological conditions involving altered secretory activity is the lipoproteinemias associated clinically with atherogenesis and cardiovascular disease. In the liver, the secretory vesicles derived from Golgi apparatus contain particles of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and low density lipoproteins (LDL). These particles enter the circulation and consistently have been implicated in atherogenesis (Eisenberg and Levy, 1975) . The apoprotein moieties of the lipopoteins are synthesized on polyribosomes and associated messenger RNA, presumably bound to membranes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (Schumacher and Adams, 1969) . Strongly osmiophilic 30 to 80 nm lipoprotein particles approximating the size range of plasma VLDL appear in smooth endoplasmic reticulum within minutes after refeeding fasted animals (Jones et al., 1967) . Next they appear in Golgi apparatus (Hamilton et al., 1967) and are found in the space of Disse within 15 minutes (Hamilton et al., 1967) . They proceed from there directly to the circulation (Schumacher and Adams, 1969) . Subsequent correlative biochemical, immunochemical, and morphological studies, made possible by the isolation of intact Golgi apparatus from liver, confirmed that the lipoprotein particles of the Golgi apparatus are precursors of plasma VLDL (Mahley et al., 1968 ) and contain the same major lipoprotein apoproteins as serum VLDL (Alexander et al., 1976) .",

            "text": "Administration of a variety of hepatotoxic drugs and/ or experimental conditions results in alterations in the lipid or lipoprotein contents within the Golgi apparatus. For example, the Golgi apparatus is transformed into a cluster of dilated vacuoles devoid of coarse electron-dense particles 30 minutes after administration of carbon tetrachloride to rats (Reynolds, 1963) . Disrupted or dilated particle-free Golgi apparatus were found in rat livers after administration of a cholinedeficient diet (Amick and Stenger, 1964) puromycin (Jones et al., 1967; Treolar et al., 1974) or orotic acid (Jatlow et al., 1965) . The increased biochemical activity and morphological prominence of the Golgi apparatus observed with chronic ethanol administration may be an adaptive phenomena resulting from promoted lipoprotein secretion (Lieber, 1985) . Alterations of secretory activity (as determined by the presence or absence of secretory vesicles) is a common initial response of Golgi apparatus to any stress. For example, Mollenhauer et al. (in press) , upon inducing toxic stress in mice by administration of trichothecene mycotoxin T-23, found changes in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and smooth endoplasmic reticulum-associated vesicles (Fig. 2) . They attributed these changes to inducement of a block of transfer of secretory product by the T-2 between endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Although the Golgi apparatus per se is a relatively resistant cell component, some of its functions involving the synthesis and/or storage of secretory products and its activities in membrane trafficking appear to be quite labile.",

            "text": "A second major function of the Golgi apparatus that occurs i n parallel to secretion is delivery of membrane to the cell surface. Here, for example, significant alterations occur with viral disorders and neoplasia. Viral disorders. Green et al. (1981) were among the first to demonstrate the passage of viral proteins through the Golgi apparatus. Evidence for a flow mechanism to account for the appearance of viral glycoproteins at the cell surface membrane has been reviewed extensively (Morre et al., 1979; Stephens and Compans, 1988) . Most enveloped viruses acquire their envelopes by budding through cellular membranes. Enveloped RNA viruses bud most frequently through the plasma membrane (Compans and Choppin, 1971; Compans and Dimmock, 1969; Lenard and Compans, 1974) . Other enveloped viruses (i.e., alpha viruses, arena viruses, orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, retroviruses, and rhabdoviruses) may bud into cytoplasmic endomembrane spaces, e.g., endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus. Some, like the herpes virus, are assembled within the nucleoplasm and acquire an envelope upon budding a t the inner nuclear envelope (Stephens and Compans, 1988) . The protein portions of viral glycoproteins are coded for by the virus. Then they are glycosylated at the Golgi apparatus. In a study of the glycosylation of envelope glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus precursors, Hunt and Summers (1976) used pulse-labeled, virus-infected HeLa cells with radioactive sugar precursors to show the addition of sugar residues (glucosamine and mannose) proximal to the linkage with protein by rough endoplasmic reticulum, the addition of more distal sugars (galactose, sialic acid, fucose, and possibly more glucosamine) in a light density endomembrane fraction now known to be the Golgi apparatus, as well as the accumulation of mature glycoprotein in the plasma membrane.",

The role of the Golgi apparatus in cell transformation and neoplasia is not as well understood as its involvement in the processing of membrane proteins and glycoproteins (Dunphy and Rothman, 1985; Farquhar, 1985; Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985) as well as in lysosome formation (Creek and Sly, 1984; Farquhar, 1985) . However, several authors have noted the possibility of a relationship between cell transformation and the Golgi apparatus (Morre and Ovtracht, 1977; Nicolson, 1984; Morre, 1989) . Both morphologic and biochemical investigations have provided evidence for a n altered Golgi apparatus in the transformed state. Compared with host liver, a change in the dimensions of Golgi apparatus in hepatomas was noted by McCarthy et al. (1974) . Likewise, in a series of 35 Morris hepatomas of differing growth rates, a n effect on the lengths or number of cisternae of rate (Hruban et al., 1972 (Hruban et al., , 1979 . To varying degrees, hepatomas compared with normal liver also lost the ability to elaborate specific secretory proteins into serum (Redman et al., 1979) . Several investigators (Hudgins et al., 1971; suggested that the Golgi apparatus of transformed cells may shift from a secretory to a membrane-generating mode of functioning. Ghadially (1982) noted that most tumors do not contain an abundance of Golgi apparatus compared with their cell of origin. The Golgi apparatus is nearly always poorly developed or difficult to identify in fastgrowing anaplastic tumors while relatively well differentiated tumors usually have a well developed Golgi apparatus provided the tissue of origin also has a well developed Golgi apparatus. Furthermore, a correlation exists between the degree of differentiation and the size of the Golgi apparatus; that is, the less differentiated tumors have smaller Golgi apparatus. Finally, some tumors exhibit marked hypertrophy, dilatation, and distortion of the Golgi apparatus. Mostly the Golgi apparatus of tumors seems to acquire a morphology similar to that of Golgi apparatus observed in juvenile or dividing cells (Eisenberg and Levy, 1975) .",

The pool size of GDP-L-fucose in Morris hepatoma 7777 was found to be 12.8 nmoleslg wet weight compared with 6.5 nmoleslg wet weight for normal liver. In addition, specific activities of GDP-fucose: glycoprotein fucosyltransferase were increased at least twofold to threefold over that of normal liver in a number of rat hepatomas , whereas in these tumors the specific activities of sialyltransferase generally were decreased .

Functional changes in membranes are frequently expressed in terms of ultrastructural alterations and vice versa. It is important that only observations of well-fixed and well-preserved material be considered.

Most likely, membrane alterations expressed a t the cell surface arise through biosynthetic or processing modifications and are products of formation of internal endomembranes.

            "text": "After enzymes destined for lysosomes are transferred from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, two membrane-bound enzymes in the early (probably cis) portion of the Golgi apparatus catalyze the phosphorylation of a specific subset of high-mannose oligosaccharide chains a t the 6-carbon position of mannose (Pohlman et al., 1982; Goldberg and Kornfeld, 1983) . The processing enzymes involved in the addition of the mannose-6-phosphate recognition label have been localized to the Golgi apparatus compartments. The biosynthesis of the phosphomannosyl recognition marker on lysosomal enzymes is by a two-step reaction. First, N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate is transferred from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to mannose residues by UDP-GlcNac:N-acetylglucosaminyl-l-phosphotransferase, which selectively phosphorylates lysosomal enzymes and gives rise to a phosphodiester intermediate Reitman et al., 1981; . Then the phosphomannosyl recognition marker is generated by removal of the N-acetylglucosamine by a n N-acetyulglucosamine 1-phosphodiester a-N-acetylglucosaminidase Kornfeld, 1980, 1981; Waheed et al., 1981) . This allows high affinity binding of the recognition marker to the 215 kD mannose-6-phosphate receptors in the Golgi apparatus. Subsequently, there is a low pH-mediated dissociation of the ligands from the receptor, followed by a proteolytic cleavage and a dephosphorylation. Then the receptor recycles back to the Golgi apparatus to pick up another ligand molecule and the lysosomal enzymes are packaged into lysosomes.",

The inability of their lysosomal enzymes to bind to the mannose-6-phosphate receptors is the major contributor to these and other diseases (Table 1) . Although the mannose-6-phosphate pathway is important in targeting enzymes to lysosomes, there is evidence that there are also other mechanisms available for localizing acid hydrolases to lysosomes. Thus far, however, attempts to demonstrate a receptor that binds lysosomal enzymes independent of the recognition marker have been unsuccessful (Kornfeld, 1986) .",

            "text": "Inflammation induced in rats by subcutaneous injection of turpentine resulted in the release of Galp-4GlcNac a2-6-sialyltransferase from rat liver Golgi membranes upon sonication followed by incubation at reduced pH (Lammers and Jamieson, 1988) . Release of the sialyltransferase was substantially inhibited by pepstatin A, a potent inhibitor of cathepsin D-like proteinases as well as when sonicated Golgi apparatus membranes were incubated with antiserum raised against rat liver lysosomal cathepsin D. The acutephase behavior of this enzyme might be explained by the possibility that a major portion of sialyltransferase containing the catalytic site is released from a membrane anchor by a cathepsin-like proteinase that is located at the luminal face of the Golgi apparatus. Bainton et al. (1989) , using both trimetaphosphatase histochemistry and an antibody to a Golgi apparatus membrane antigen as markers to study phagocytosis, observed a rapid reorganization of the Golgi apparatus region of macrophages. The Golgi apparatus, which were tightly clustered around the centrioles, dispersed into vesicles and reorganized near the basal surface while there was swelling, fragmentation, and decrease in number of Golgi apparatus cisternae. The membrane antigen was found in the large basal vacuoles as well as associated with the adherent basal surface of the macrophages.",

            "text": "Although it is remarkedly resistant to morphological alteration, the Golgi apparatus frequently does respond in one way or another to various inhibitors, effectors, or environmental stimuli. Examples are listed in Table 2 . For example, the extent of the cisternae may increase and one or more additional cisternae may be added when secretion is inhibited. In contrast, when secretion is stimulated, the Golgi apparatus may be reduced by a t least one cisterna per stack. Chemical or physical dissembly of microtubules leads to loss of cell polarity and a reversible disorganization of the Golgi apparatus in that the stacks of cisternae are dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (Sandoval et al., 1984; Thyberg and Moskalewski, 1985) . When oubain, which is known to interfere with sodium and potassium transport, was added to cultures of rat and mouse sensory ganglia, some of the Golgi apparatus swelled, and then eventually nearly all of the Golgi apparatus disappeared and in their place large numbers of vacuoles appeared (Whetsell and Bunge, 1969) . Also, light ether anesthesia modifies activities of some enzymes involved in the metabolism of the Golgi apparatus (Katona, 1975) . For instance, alkaline phosphatase activity was increased significantly, but acid phosphatase was slightly decreased after a n initial rise upon exposure to light ether anesthesia. TPPase activity decreased but 10 hours later returned to above control level. Galactosyltransferase was slightly increased while no significant changes were observed in arylsulphatase-A, but the activity of arylsulphatase-B decreased. Earlier, glycosidase and g1ycoprotein:glycosyl transferase were altered in cell lines resistant to certain drugs (Bosmann, 1971) . In a more recent study, Martin and Morre (1988) found decreased activity of galactosyltransferase in Golgi apparatus fractions isolated from liver of rats fed excess vitamin A.",

That the Golgi apparatus is modified by many types of injuries is not new. As early as 1914, Cajal observed that the Golgi apparatus is a particularly vulnerable organelle. However, it is important to emphasize that carrying to completion essential metabolic processes within the cell invariably demands interrelationships of a number of cell components such as the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and others. Frequently, no one component of the cell is singly affected.",
