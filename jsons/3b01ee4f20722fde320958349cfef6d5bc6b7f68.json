Methods: Administrative support with the aim of zero nosocomial transmission by reducing elective clinical services, decanting wards, mobilizing isolation facilities, providing adequate personal protective equipment, coordinating laboratory network for rapid molecular diagnosis under 4-tier active surveillance for hospitalized-and out-patients, and organizing staff forum and training was implemented under the framework of preparedness plan in Hospital Authority. The trend of SARS-CoV-2 in the first 72 days was compared with that of SARS-CoV 2003. Results: Up to day 72 of the epidemic, 130 (0.40%) of 32,443 patients being screened confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Compared with SARS outbreak in 2003, the SARS-CoV-2 case load constituted 8.9% (130 SARS-CoV-2/1458 SARS-CoV) of SARS-CoV infected cases at day 72 of the outbreak. The incidences of nosocomial acquisition of SARS-CoV per-1,000-SARS-patient-day and per-100-SARS-patient-admission were 7.9 and 16.9 respectively, which were significantly higher than the corresponding incidences of SARS-CoV-2 (zero infection, p<0.001). Conclusion: Administrative support to infection control could minimize the risk of nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",

Of 386 healthcare workers (HCWs) infected with SARS-CoV in Hong Kong, 8 of them (2.2%) succumbed. Six HCWs (2 doctors, 1 nurse, and 3 healthcare assistants) of 8 were the employee of Hospital Authority, the governing body of all 43 public hospitals, divided into 7 cluster-networks, responsible for 90% of inpatient service in Hong Kong. A \"Select Committee to inquire into the handling of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak by the Government and the Hospital Authority\" was established by the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China to in order to examine the performance and accountability of the Government and Hospital Authority and their officers at policymaking and management levels [7] . The report includes temporal sequence of events and daily statistics on SARS patients with breakdown by healthcare workers and patients. The information is retrieved for analyzing the epidemiology of SARS in 2003 [8] . When a novel coronavirus disease, known as COVID-19 due to SARS-CoV-2 emerged 17 years later, Hospital Authority immediately activated our response plan to combat the epidemic and to prevent nosocomial transmission and outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2. The clinical perspective of infection control measures was reported recently [9] . The epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 until 11 March 2020 (at day 72 after the official announcement of a cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, Hubei Province, by NHCPRC in Hong Kong) was analyzed. This is also the date when WHO declared the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results were compared with the epidemiological data of SARS-CoV at day 72 (11 April 2003) after the official announcement of atypical pneumonia in Guangdong Province, China on 11 February 2003. In addition, we also compared the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong with Hubei Province, China, which is the most severe affected region by SARS-CoV-2, and the other countries or areas with uncontrolled local transmission at day 72, including Republic of Korea, Islamic Republic of Iran, and Italy, using the publicly accessible information from the WHO website [10] .",

In the first 72 days, the number of infected patients (n=130) with SARS-CoV-2 was 11 times lower than that of SARS-CoV (n=1,458) according to the day-by-day comparison (Figure 3). While the number of infected HCWs for SARS-CoV-2 remained zero on day 72 of 2020, 335 HCWs were infected with SARS-CoV on day 72 in 2003. At the end of the outbreak of 2003 SARS-CoV, 386",

Upon receiving the first imported case of SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong on day 22, the response level was further elevated to the emergency level on day 26. The Central Command Committee (CCC) composed of the top management team of 7 clusternetworks and HAHO is responsible for the decision for various administrative supports in consultation with ad hoc CCIDER which is responsible for professional advice. Up to day 72, a total of 16 meetings of ad hoc CCIDER were held once every 5 days on average, especially focusing on the evolution of infection control recommendations issued by World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States, as well as the scientific evidences published during the evolution of epidemic. CCC was held daily since the activation of emergency level. Hospital Authority has set the priority of service to support the infection control and clinical management against SARS-CoV-2. The elective and non-essential clinical services were trimmed down to reduce the bed occupancies in the hospital. Visitors were prohibited to the hospitals except for compassionate reasons. The utilization of airborne infection isolation room (AIIRs) of 1400 beds in the Hong Kong was closely monitored. The first 20 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2would be admitted to a designated hospital. Subsequently, each cluster-network is required to take care of the next 20 confirmed cases. The major incident control centre of HAHO is responsible for cross cluster-network transfer of confirmed cases.Procurement, distribution, and monitor the utilization of PPE and laboratory reagents for rapid molecular diagnostic among 7 cluster-networks were performed by HAHO and hospital management teams. Accommodation is provided to staffs who are working in high risk areas and isolation facilities during the period of emergency response level.A 4-tier active surveillance for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 was implemented for patients upon admission (tier 1 to 3)[9], while the tier 4 surveillance was initiated for patients attending outpatient clinics as well as accident and emergency department since 20 February 2020 (day 52) (Table 2). From day 1 to day 72, 119 (0.47%) of 25,097 patients fulfilling tier 1 to 3 were confirmed, while between day 52 and 72, eleven (0.15%) of 7,346 out-patients were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2.",

It is even more important to perform rapid molecular diagnostic test and isolate patients with SARS-CoV-2 as early as possible. It is the reason why we further extended the scope of active surveillance from hospitalized patients to outpatients who have relatively mild respiratory symptoms, and continue contact tracing for potential secondary cases in order to identify any transmission in hospital and community. Business service department of Hospital Authority plays a key role to secure the timely procurement of diagnostic platforms and reagents, as well as PPEfor HCWs because global shortage of PPE becomes strategically important in the pandemic of COVID-19. Major incident control centre of Hospital Authority coordinates the utilization of isolation facilities by cross hospital transferal of confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 across different public hospitals in order to avoid an individual hospital being overwhelmed by confirmed cases. Temporal conversion of general wards to AIIRs was conducted to accommodate the increasing number of patients with SARS-CoV-2. In addition, non-emergency clinical services were trimmed down in order to reduce the bed occupancy and improve the manpower ratio of HCWs to patients, which may facilitate the control of outbreak. No visiting policy during emergency response level in Hospital Authority may further reduce the risk of importation of patients with SARS-CoV-2 from the community. Decanting of wards and deployment of HCWs to care for patients with SARS-CoV-2 were planned in advance. As working in an unfamiliar environment and lapses in infection control were attributed to the nosocomial outbreak of SARS [22], the deployed HCWs other than the discipline of internal medicine would be oriented for the logistic of patients' management in the isolation wards and trained for the use of PPE well before managing suspected and confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2. Note that inappropriate removal of PPE may increase the risk of acquisition of SARS-CoV [23]. Ongoing staff forum and training sessions for PPE are regularly conducted to enhance the alertness of HCWs. During the community outbreak of pandemic influenza A, provision of timely education to the staff was one of the important parameters to achieve zero nosocomial outbreak of pandemic influenza A H1N1 virus in 2009 [12]. The training materials were compiled into a communication kits which is uploaded to the electronic platform of Hospital Authority with free access to all staff. The health promotion messages to HCWs are further promulgated via social media such as Facebook, YouTube, and WhatsApp group. From the declaration of pandemic (day 72) to the time of manuscript submission on 24 March 2020 (day 85), the number of global confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 has nearly tripled (from 118,000 to 332,000). Almost 4,824 HCWs infected with 24 deaths in Italy [24]. In mainland China, it was shown that 29% (40 of 138) of admitted SARS-CoV-2 patients in Zhongnan hospital, Wuhan were HCWs [25]. This proves the high risk of nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2. On day 85, the number of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 was over 300 in Hong Kong while zero transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs and hospitalized patients could be maintained in Hong Kong for almost 3 months, suggestive of a significant improvement in the healthcare infrastructure to combat against emerging infectious diseases in Hong Kong.",
