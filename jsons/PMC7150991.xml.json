Of these, sporadic transmissions to humans occur and are frequently characterized by high pathogenicity [5]. The key factor that makes the influenza virus unique is its variability and the genome present in virions in eight segments. Co-infection of a single cell results in shuffling of these genomic RNA puzzles, and new, hybrid progeny emerges. Reassortants are usually less fit and are eliminated, but in sporadic cases, a new strain appears that is able to effectively infect human cells but is not recognized by our defense systems.",

However, the vaccine does not provide complete protection, especially in infants, the elderly, and patients with immune deficits. Antivirals are, therefore, a complementary tool for the comprehensive management of the disease\u2014five approved anti-influenza drugs are available. The old generation of drugs, amantadine and rimantadine, interfere with M2 protein activity and inhibit the release of the viral genome to the replication site during virus entry. Unfortunately, due to the emergence of drug-resistant variants, these medicinal products have already been withdrawn [8]. The second group of drugs encompasses zanamivir and oseltamivir, which inhibit the activity of the neuraminidase (NA) protein. These NA inhibitors (NAIs) interfere with the virus egress and, to a lesser extent, also entry. However, the emergence of drug resistance has been already reported [8]. In October of 2018 the FDA approved the new anti-influenza active substance, Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza). Baloxavir inhibits viral endonuclease, which is responsible for cleavage of cellular mRNAs near their 5\u2032-termini, in order to generate the primers required for viral RNA synthesis (cap snatching) [9]. Nonetheless, as clearly shown for, e.g., the HIV-1 virus, only a combined therapy, simultaneously interfering with different molecular targets, is effective and long-lasting.",

BBR has a long history as a traditional remedy in many parts of the world [11]. The activity of BBR has been widely discussed in the scientific literature\u2014it has been reported to exhibit therapeutic properties including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-cancer, anticonvulsant, antidepressant, anti-Alzheimer, anti-arrhythmic, and anti-diabetic effects in vitro and in vivo [12,13]. Moreover, the compound exhibits broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against bacteria and viruses. BBR has been reported to be effective against Streptococcus agalactiae, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, and Staphylococcus spp. Additionally, BBR has been shown to block herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1, 2) replication in Vero cells [14]. Recent studies have shown potent inhibition of the Zika virus (ZIKV) [15,16]. Other reports have shown BBR-mediated suppression of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) replication in epithelial cells, probably via inhibition of RSV-mediated early p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation and inhibition of virus entry into the cell [17]. Another publication showed an inhibitory effect on the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) through inhibition of virus-induced MAPK signaling [10,13,18].",

In the work by Cecil et al., BBR inhibited the replication of two strains of the H1N1 virus in a murine macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) and adenocarcinoma human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549) but did not prevent the expression of viral proteins [19]. The authors reported that virus replication was diminished by inducing the formation of viral protein aggregates within the host cell cytoplasm. An in vivo experiment (mice models) confirmed these observations, as BBR reduced mice mortality from 90% to 55% and decreased virus titers in the lungs on day 2 post-infection (p.i.) [20,21]. Moreover, BBR also suppresses pulmonary inflammation and reduces necrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, and pulmonary edema [21]. Cecil et al. tested the anti-influenza properties of BBR using three in vitro models, i.e., A549 cells, RAW 264.7 cells, and Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and observed inhibition of virus replication only in the first two cell types [19]. No inhibition was noted in MDCK cells. On the other hand, Wu et al. tested BBR only in MDCK cells and observed strong inhibition of virus replication [20]. ",

Influenza A virus stock was incubated with BBR under constant mixing for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were diluted 100 times to ensure that the BBR concentration was below the lower limit of the effective range. Samples were then titrated according to the Reed and Muench method [24].(II)Cell protection assay examines the effect of the compound on the cell surface. In this assay, cells were incubated with BBR for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. After incubation, the media were removed, and cells were washed with PBS. Then, cells were infected with the influenza A virus (TCID50 = 400) or mock control for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C.

We performed a standard virus replication assay by infecting the MDCK cells in the presence or absence of BBR. Concomitantly, cell viability was monitored using the XTT assay. A significant inhibitory effect of BBR in the MDCK cells was observed in our experimental setting in samples treated with BBR at 80 and 160 \u00b5M, while IC50 was equal to 52 \u00b5M. We did not observe any significant decrease in cell viability (TC50 = 1035 \u00b5M, SI = 20) (Figure 1A, Table 1). These results indicate inhibitory properties similar to those obtained by Wu et al.

To sort out the actual activity of BBR, we decided to evaluate BBR in a more natural system, mimicking the human airway epithelium (HAE). Briefly, HAE was reconstituted on the interface of air and media using primary human cells. This model has previously been well-characterized and successfully used by us in other studies [22,32,33]. To the best of our knowledge, it is the most natural cellular model for testing of potential inhibitory compounds against a variety of respiratory viruses. 3D HAE cultures form well-differentiated, polarized cultures that resemble in vivo pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium lining the conductive airways of the human respiratory tract. We did not observe cytotoxicity at tested concentrations (i.e., up to 160 \u00b5M, 0.054 \u00b5g/mL), suggesting that BBR is not toxic towards non-cancerous cells, consistent with previously published data. However, BBR inhibited influenza A virus replication in HAE cultures only at higher concentrations compared to LET1 cells (IC50 = 16 \u00b5M). This may be explained by the fact that BBR was not continuously present on the cultures, but only during daily washes of the apical surface (Figure 2).",

After 12 h, we observed characteristic accumulation of a viral RNP complex inside nuclei, in both cells treated with BBR and U0126 (Figure 5A). This effect was confirmed by image analysis. Significant differences in NP signal accumulation were observed for both the U0126 and BBR cells compared to the untreated control (Figure 5B). More than 90% of NP colocalized with nuclear staining in cells treated with U0126 or BBR compared to about 70% in control cells. This effect was clearly visible between 12 and 20 h p.i. After this time, large amounts of RNP were also visible in the cytoplasm (data not shown). This outcome may be due to the removal of BBR from the cell or its degradation. Western blot analyses indicate moderate inhibition of ERK1 activation by BBR at 20 \u00b5M concentration (45% inhibition) compared to the U0126 cell (76% inhibition) (Figure 6.). We observed, however, a slight increase in the amount of phospho-ERK in control-infected cells, as previously reported [34]. To confirm confocal imaging results, we performed a similar experiment and isolated cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions for Western blot analysis. The analysis showed higher quantities (~3 fold increase) of viral NP in nuclear fractions of cells treated with U0126 or 20 \u00b5M BBR (0.007 \u00b5g/mL) compared to untreated infection, confirming our confocal imaging observations (Figure 7B). Lower BBR concentration, however, did not cause significant accumulation of influenza A virus NP (data not shown). In the case of cytoplasmatic fraction, we observed a moderate yet clear decrease of NP (about 40% inhibition) signal in treated cells which may suggest that BBR does not interfere with the assembly and release of virions. Taking these results together, obtained data suggest an inhibition on the influenza A virus by BBR through the downregulation of the MAPK/ERK1 pathway. ",

Functional assays demonstrated the effect of BBR on virus replication, and not the receptor binding or virus entry. The cell-type-dependent differences in the compound antiviral activity suggested that the compound likely acts on the host cell, and not the virus itself. For this reason, we made an effort to link the known activities of BBR with pathways that are important for the replication of the influenza A virus. Two recently published reports show BBR-mediated inhibition of the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and the enterovirus 71, which was caused by interference with the virus-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, including extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) [35,36]. It is also known that the active form of ERK1 (p-ERK1) is required for the nuclear export of the influenza A virus RNP complex during the infection [37] and that this pathway is modulated during the infection. First, the ERK pathway is upregulated shortly after the infection, to rapidly decrease after the first hour [38]. Next, the pathway is upregulated again at the late stage of the infection, when RNP must be exported from the nucleus to assemble into progeny virions [37]. ERK inhibition with a specific inhibitor U0126 impairs RNP transport and results in retention of RNPs inside the nucleus, and consequent inhibition of viral replication [37]. We verified if BBR exhibited activity similar to that of U0126. Confocal microscopy revealed a similar RNP retention within the cell nuclei in both BBR-treated and MAPK/ERK inhibitor U0126-treated A549 cells (Figure 5). Accumulation of the nucleoprotein was also observed when nuclear fractions of cells treated with BBR and U0126 were analyzed (Figure 6). The literature does not link the specific MAPK/ERK inhibition and the activity of BBR in A549 cells [39,40], which suggests that the antiviral effect is specific. ",

The antiviral effect differs between cell lines, but we confirmed its relevance using the most advanced model of the human respiratory epithelium. A subsequent study revealed that the inhibition of the influenza A virus replication results from BBR-specific inhibition of the MAPK/ERK1 pathway, required for the effective production of progeny virions. It is worth noting that due to its mechanism of action, the emergence of resistant mutants is less likely than for commonly used inhibitors targeting viral proteins. ",
