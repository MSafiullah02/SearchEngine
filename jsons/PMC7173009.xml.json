            "text": "The majority of enveloped viruses contains multiple glycans on their envelope proteins. In some cases (i.e. human immunodeficiency virus, HIV) [1], hepatitis C virus (HCV) [2], coronaviruses (CoV) [3], influenza virus (INF) [4]), the envelope is extensively glycosylated. The gp120 envelope of HIV is among the most heavily glycosylated proteins known [5]. Protein glycosylation may serve multiple functions, including proper folding of the nascent peptide, avoiding peptide precipitation due to the presence of lipophylic amino acid domains in the protein, protection against breakdown by proteases, increasing molecular diversity, and last but not least, in some cases, escape of immune surveillance [6]. After the glycan building block (GlcNAc)2Man9Glc3 has been added to asparagines of the native peptide that are part of a N-glycosylation motif (NXS/T), the N-glycans are processed by \u03b1-glucosidases to remove the terminal three glucoses in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER). Then, ER and Golgi class I \u03b11,2-mannosidases specifically hydrolyze \u03b11,2-mannose residues, and catalyse the trimming of the high-mannose chains involving four \u03b11,2-linked mannose residues, and this process generates Man5GlcNAc2. Subsequent action of GlcNAc transferase I initiates complex chain formation and yields the substrate for Golgi \u03b1-mannosidase II which trims the terminal \u03b11,3- and \u03b11,6-mannose residues [7]. Further processing events in the Golgi apparatus eventually lead to glycans that consist of a wide variety of carbohydrates and combinations thereof [7], [8], [9], [10]. Since mammalian viruses use the host cell glycosylation machinery for glycan synthesis and modification of the glycans that need to be incorporated in their envelope glycoproteins, it has been suggested that it is possible to target the viral envelope glycoproteins by inhibiting certain host-cell glucosidases at low levels that do not affect host-cell viability [5]. The altered glycan structures on the viral envelope proteins may then result in decreased viral infectivity (fitness), virus assembly and/or virus particle release [5]. HIV infectivity has indeed shown to be suppressed in cell culture when the virus was propagated in the presence of the \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor NB-DNJ [11]. The latter drug has been evaluated in phase II clinical trials as an anti-HIV therapeutic [12]. For hepatitis B virus (HBV), it was demonstrated that NN-DNJ (and also to a minor extent NB-DNJ) disrupted the proper folding and efficient release of the viral envelope molecules. It was shown that NB-DNJ could reduce virus levels in a dose-dependent manner [13]. Since the E1 and E2 transmembrane glycoproteins of HCV are important for host cell entry [14], and since proper folding is calnexin-dependent [15], glucosidase inhibitors may also be expected to affect HCV entry and infectivity.",

Such mutant virus strains display different degrees of phenotypic (in)sensitivity to the CBA\u2019s antiviral activity depending the number and the nature of the glycans that were deleted in gp120. In this study, we wanted to investigate whether the concomitant combination of CBAs and the glycosylation inhibitor 1-deoxymannojirimycin (DMJ) against wild-type and mutant (glycan-deleted) gp120-containing HIV-1 strains could afford a superior antiviral activity than when added as single drugs. DMJ was used because it selectively inhibits \u03b11,2-mannosidase I resulting in the accumulation of high-mannose glycans on the viral envelope glycoprotein. We found a significantly increased sensitivity of the mutant virus strains to the inhibition by DMJ, and a marked potentiation of the antiviral efficacy of CBAs when co-administered with DMJ, both for wild-type and mutant virus strains.",

As a result, the amount of high-mannose type glycan structures on the glycoprotein markedly increases in the presence of DMJ since further trimming/processing of the high-mannose glycans to hybrid- or complex-type glycans has been largely prevented by the DMJ-mediated blockade of the \u03b11,2-mannosidases I. Since the CBAs GNA and HHA are known to specifically bind to \u03b1(1,3)- and/or \u03b1(1,6)-mannose oligomer structures [23], it could be reasoned that a higher amount of high-mannose type glycans on gp120 may allow these CBAs to concomittantly bind to a higher amount of glycans on the HIV-1 envelope. Consequently, they may exert a more pronounced antiviral activity in DMJ-treated virus-infected cells. We observed indeed a potentiation of the anti-HIV-1 activity of HHA and GNA in the presence of DMJ concentrations that exerted themselves no antiviral activity when used as a single drug. Thus, concomittant administration of glycosylation inhibitors (such as DMJ) and CBAs in HIV-1-infected cell cultures may further potentiate the antiviral activity of the mannose-specific CBAs.",

Whereas DMJ was not effective at all at 500 \u03bcM against parent wild-type virus it could indeed inhibit mutant virus infection at an EC50 that ranged between 90 and 150 \u03bcM, that is at an at least more than 5\u201310-fold lower DMJ concentration. These mutant virus strains showed 7 or 8 glycan deletions at putative N-glycosylation sites in gp120 [22], and the deletions preferentially occurred at high-mannose type glycan sites (Table 1). Such glycan deletions in the mutant HIV-1 strains resulted in a marked phenotypic resistance to the HHA and GNA CBAs. It could be assumed that DMJ converts at least part of the remaining glycans of the mutant gp120 into high-mannose-type glycan structures, making them more vulnerable to interaction with the CBAs. Consequently, an increased antiviral activity would then be expected upon co-administration with DMJ, a phenomenon that we indeed observed to occur in the HIV-infected cell cultures. Interestingly, a similar phenomenon has been observed to occur when Pradimicin A, a high mannose-type glycan-binding antibiotic, was exposed to mammalian U937 cells that had been pretreated with DMJ [24]. Under these experimental conditions, the cells express high levels of high mannose-type oligosaccharides and become sensitive to PRM-A (resulting in apoptosis induction). No such apoptosis induction was observed in PRM-A-exposed cell cultures that were not pretreated with DMJ [24], [25]. Thus, the combined use of CBAs and the \u03b11,2-mannosidase-inhibitor DMJ enabled partial restoration of the phenotypic sensitivity of the mutant HIV-1 strains against the CBAs. Our results argue for combined administration of CBAs and DMJ to wild-type virus, because phenotypic resistance development may be expected to slow down when DMJ is present during CBA treatment of HIV-1. The slight but consistently observed antagonistic activity that has been observed for DMJ when combined with the lowest CBA concentrations is rather puzzling and the molecular basis of this phenomenon is yet unclear.",

Indeed, inhibition of cellular glycosylation enzymes in virus-infected cells may not only compromise proper viral glycopeptide formation, but may also have deleterious effects on glycoproteins of non-infected cells. However, therapy with drugs, in casu glycosylation inhibitors, should not necessary aim to ablate enzyme activity but should rather be used to modulate enzyme activities involved in glycosylation [26]. Since the envelope gp120 glycoprotein of HIV is among the highest glycosylated glycoproteins currently known and has a high (functional) requirement of high-mannose type glycans, it may be assumed that a moderate attenuation of \u03b11,2-mannosidase I activity may have a more pronounced deleterious impact on the synthesis of the viral envelope glycoprotein than on the cellular glycoproteins, allowing for a certain degree of selectivity of such inhibitors. Proper in vivo experiments should reveal the therapeutic efficacy and feasibility of such drugs.",
