We introduce a novel framework to model (non-)Markovian susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) stochastic processes that are evolving either in continuous or discrete time on networks. We apply our simulation framework to study hybrid SIR processes that describe infections as discretetime Markovian and recovery events as continuous-time non-Markovian processes, which mimic the distribution of cell-cycle times. Our results suggest that the effective-spreading-rate description of epidemic processes fails to uniquely capture the behavior of such hybrid and also general non-Markovian disease dynamics.

Models of epidemic processes such as the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model and related models provided various insights into dynamical and stationary features of disease, opinion, and failure spread in social and technical systems [1] [2] [3] . In the SIR model, infected individuals may transmit a disease to susceptible ones. After a certain period, infected individuals recover and are not part of the diseasetransmission process anymore. The exact time evolution of the continuous-time stochastic SIR spreading process is described by the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation or its differential form (i.e., the master equation). However, exact analytical solutions of the master equation are limited to special cases and therefore different approximations are being used (e.g., deterministic ODE models [4-6] and cavity-like models [7, 8] ). Gillespie and kinetic Monte-Carlo (kMC) approaches [9] provide techniques to generate statistically exact trajectories of a master equation. The assumption underlying kMC methods is that waiting times between consecutive recovery and infection events are exponentially distributed. However, many natural processes including social dynamics [10, 11] exhibit correlation and memory (i.e., non-Markovian) effects [12] and are therefore not described by exponential (i.e., memoryless) waiting-time distributions [13] . Recent attempts to simulate non-Markovian disease dynamics led to the development of the non-Markovian Gillespie algorithm (nMGA) [14] and the Laplace Gillespie algorithm (LGA) [15] . Both methods are based on a mapping of multiple stochastic processes with general (continuous) waiting-time distributions to a modified kMC algorithm. The nMGA is only exact for a sufficiently large number of processes and requires to re-calculate all individual rates at every time step. The LGA interprets survival functions of waiting-time distributions as Laplace trans-",

Our framework is based on a mapping of waiting times to a shortestpath problem in a weighted spreading network. We use our framework to study hybrid continuous-discrete SIR (henceforth hybrid SIR) processes. Discrete Markovian and non-Markovian infection processes account for latency intervals during which no infection events occur or the discrete nature of social interactions (e.g., meetings, bus rides, flights, etc.) and are considered to be more closely aligned with corresponding empirical data than their continuous counterparts [16] [17] [18] . Continuoustime infection processes neglect such latency periods that may arise from incubation periods (e.g., 8-14 days for measles [19] ) and finite transfer times of information in communication and transportation networks. Our results suggest that hybrid and also general non-Markovian disease outbreaks cannot be uniquely captured by effective spreading rates. However, by mapping such SIR processes to bond percolation [20, 21] , we show that the corresponding mean transmissibilities produce the same phase diagrams independent of the underlying infectionand recovery-time distrubtions; thus providing a unifying description of general Markovian and non-Markovian SIR processes. The framework we propose assumes no specific form of waiting-time distributions [17, 22] and allows us to simulate and analytically describe general discrete, continuous, and hybrid variants of Markovian and non-Markovian SIR dynamics.",

            "text": "Shortest-path (SP) kMC. Before focusing on the simulation of hybrid SIR dynamics, we introduce the neces- sary mathematical toolbox that allows us to map general waiting times to a shortest-path problem in an underlying spreading network. Let \u03c6(\u03c4 ) and \u03c8(\u03c4 ) be the probabilitydensity or probability mass functions (PDFs or PMFs) of recovery and infection times. In continuous time, the probability that a recovery (infection) event occurs in the interval (\u03c4, \u03c4 +d\u03c4 ) is \u03c6(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 (\u03c8(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 ). The discrete time analogues \u03c6(\u03c4 ) and \u03c8(\u03c4 ) are the recovery and infection probabilities after \u03c4 steps, where \u00b7 denotes the floor function. We denote the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of \u03c6(\u03c4 ) and \u03c8(\u03c4 ) by \u03a6(\u03c4 ) and \u03a8(\u03c4 ). The function \u03a6(\u03c4 ) (\u03a8(\u03c4 )) is the probability that a recovery (infection) event occurred in [0, \u03c4 ]. In the case of Poissonian SIR dynamics, waiting-time distributions are described by the PDFs \u03c6(\u03c4 ) = \u03b3e \u2212\u03b3\u03c4 and \u03c8(\u03c4 ) = \u03b2e \u2212\u03b2\u03c4 and CDFs \u03a6(\u03c4 ) = 1 \u2212 e \u2212\u03b3\u03c4 and \u03a8(\u03c4 ) = 1 \u2212 e \u2212\u03b2\u03c4 , where \u03b3 and \u03b2 are the corresponding recovery and infection rates. Note that we use prefixes such as \"Erlang-geometric\" to indicate the recovery and infection time distributions (\u03c6(\u03c4 ) and \u03c8(\u03c4 )) of the corresponding hybrid SIR process.",

The Erlang distribution allows us to account for recovery processes that are not just exponentially distributed but more concentrated within a certain time window. It is the distribution that describes the sum of n independent exponential variables with rate \u03b3. The Erlang distribution has been used as an approximation of cell-cycle time distributions [28] and as such it is a better candidate for disease recovery processes as cells cycles have n stages through which they are progressing (e.g. n = 4 for COVID19 [29] ). In Fig. 4 (top right), we observe that Erlang-geometric SIR processes can also not be described by an effective spreading rate. The considered examples of non-Markovian SIR processes show that the effective-spreading-rate description cannot uniquely characterize hybrid and general non-Markovian disease outbreaks. Instead, the mean transmissibility T provides a unifying control parameter as we show in Fig. 4 (bottom). In the SI, we outline that this also holds for other networks. Discussion and conclusion. We introduced numerical and analytical frameworks for the study of general (non-)Markovian SIR dynamics on networks. Furthermore, we proposed a novel hybrid SIR process that models infection and recovery as discrete-time Markovian and continuous-time non-Markovian processes, respectively.",

This is of particular interest for disease control and hints at a (re-)definition of the epidemic threshold to appropriately account for disease dynamics and network structure [24] .
