Ideally, the patient should be pre-oxygenated for at least 3 min (Weingart and Levitan 2012) . If the patient is adequately breathing, oxygenation can be accomplished through a 100% non-rebreather mask with the rate of oxygen flow as high as possible. Bag Mask Ventilation (BMV) should be initiated in the apneic patients and in those with poor respiratory drive to ensure adequate pre-oxygenation. To further increase the safe apnea time and the success rate of the first intubation attempt, apneic oxygenation is used during rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in adults (Singh and Frenkel 2013; Weingart and Levitan 2012; Mittiga et al. 2015) . This entails the application of oxygen via nasal prongs in addition to pre-oxygenation, and acts as an adjunct to pre-oxygenation by providing an oxygen filled pharynx used as a reservoir for alveolar ventilation (Weingart and Levitan 2012) . Although the adult evidence shows promise (Singh and Frenkel 2013; Mittiga et al. 2015) , pediatric research on this issue is limited (Steiner 2016) .",

            "text": "Although uncuffed tubes were previously recommended in pediatrics due to airway narrowing at the glottis and concerns about mucosal injury, evidence suggests that pediatric cuffed endotracheal tubes are safe to use in the pediatric population. The use of cuffed tubes is associated with fewer tube changes, decreased risk of aspiration and allows for higher airway pressures during ventilation without an increased risk of complications (Kleinman et al. 2010a; Weiss et al. 2009; Shi et al. 2016) . It is important that cuffed tubes are inflated to no more than 20 cm of water. The size of tube can be estimated by lengthbased tools or by using the following agebased formulas: age/4 + 3.5 for cuffed tubes or age/4 + 4 for uncuffed tubes (Kleinman et al. 2010a ). An endotracheal tube one size above and below the estimated size should also be available, and consideration should be given to using a stylet. Successful placement should be confirmed through direct visualization, CO 2 detection, and chest x-ray or ultrasound confirmation in addition to auscultation (Mittiga et al. 2015; Kleinman et al. 2010a; Chou et al. 2015) . Cricoid pressure is no longer routinely recommended during rapid sequence intubation as it has been shown to decrease the success of intubation with little effect on the risk of aspiration (Kleinman et al. 2010a; Ellis et al. 2007 ). If BMV is unsuccessful and intubation is not possible a Laryngeal-Mask Airway (LMA) may be used to provide a patent airway and ventilation support (de Caen et al. 2015a ).",

Etomidate, at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg is an excellent sedative medication for this purpose due to its minimal associated cardiovascular side effects. Given the risk of possible adrenal suppression, etomidate is not currently recommended in the septic patient (Kleinman et al. 2010a; den Brinker et al. 2008; Chan et al. 2012; Bruder et al. 2015) . Ketamine is a dissociative sedative agent used at doses of 1-3 mg/kg. Ketamine is particularly useful in hypotensive patients or those with severe asthma. Since ketamine does not inhibit spontaneous respirations, it is a useful sedative for difficult intubations. Contrary to previous belief, recent evidence suggests that ketamine is safe to use in children with increased intracranial pressure. (Filanovsky et al. 2010; Hughes 2011) . Although commonly used for intubation, the use of propofol in the emergency department should be limited to experienced personnel due to a significant risk of hypotension (Shaw and Bachur 2016; Singh and Frenkel 2013) . Other medications such as benzodiazepines and opiates can also be used for sedation in RSI but these may not be as reliable or effective (Singh and Frenkel 2013; Stollings et al. 2014) .",

SIRS in children is characterized by a temperature abnormality (fever or hypothermia) or an age-specific abnormality in the white blood cell count, and one of the following: tachycardia (or bradycardia in infants under 1 year of age), tachypnea or an acute respiratory condition requiring mechanical ventilation. SIRS in the presence of confirmed or suspected infection constitutes sepsis. Severe sepsis is defined as sepsis associated with cardiovascular dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or dysfunction in two or more other organ systems (specific definitions of respiratory, cardiovascular, neurologic, hematologic, hepatic and renal dysfunction are based on expert opinion). Septic shock is defined as sepsis in the presence of cardiovascular dysfunction. Compensated shock refers to a shock state in which the blood pressure remains in age-appropriate range. Hypotension represents a late and often ominous sign in pediatric patients. The presence of hypotension is the hallmark of decompensated shock.",

Young infants, especially low birth weight neonates, are at the highest risk, and children with co-morbid medical conditions account for more than half the cases. This includes children with chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, malignancy, and those with conditions impacting the immune system (Hartman et al. 2013) . Children with indwelling devices and anatomic abnormalities are also at high risk for bacterial seeding and infection. In North America, the mortality rate from pediatric severe sepsis and septic shock is estimated to be 5-15% but approaches 30% in those with comorbid disorders and significant organ dysfunction (Ruth et al. 2014; Hartman et al. 2013; Watson et al. 2003; Kutko et al. 2003; Weiss et al. 2015a ).",

The differences between the pediatric and adult response to infection have important implications on the presentation and treatment of sepsis in children compared to older patients (Brierley et al. 2009 ). First, severe hypovolemia, likely due to a combination of dehydration and increased microvascular permeability, is a hallmark of pediatric septic shock. Therefore, children frequently respond well to aggressive fluid resuscitation. Second, the hemodynamic response to sepsis is significantly different in the two populations ( Fig. 8.1 ). Up to 90% of adult patients present with a \"hyperdynamic shock\", otherwise known as \"warm shock\". Despite myocardial dysfunction, cardiac output (CO) is typically maintained by an increase in heart rate and decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Thus, the adult response to sepsis is characterized by tachycardia, hypotension and a normal, or increased, cardiac output. The predominant cause of mortality in adult septic shock is vasomotor paralysis (when SVR cannot be further increased with vasopressor agents). In contrast, at least 50% of infants and children present with \"cold shock\". Although an increase in heart rate is a child's principal means of maintaining CO, a predominant response to a decreased CO in children is vasoconstriction. Blood flow is redistributed from non-essential vascular beds such as the skin, to essential organs such as the heart, brain and lungs. This increase in SVR maintains a normal blood pressure, even with significant decreases in CO. Hypotension is therefore a late sign in pediatric septic shock, and often signifies impending cardiovascular collapse. Thus, the pediatric response to sepsis is often characterized by tachycardia, normal blood pressure and decreased cardiac output. In children, low CO is most often associated with mortality, in contrast to adults who often succumb to low SVR. It should be noted however, that the clinical presentation of septic shock in children can be highly variable and can include a combination of hemodynamic abnormalities.",

The presence of hypotension, although not necessary for diag-nosis, is confirmatory in a child with suspected infection. Although no laboratory test is sensitive or specific enough to be used alone, some experts recommend using lactic acid (a by product of anaerobic metabolism and marker of tissue hypoperfusion) as a diagnostic adjunct. Elevated initial lactic acid levels (\u22654.0 mmol/L), and failure of lactate levels to normalize (<2 mmol/L) or progressively clear with resuscitative efforts may be poor prognostic indicators in pediatric sepsis (Scott et al. 2012 (Scott et al. , 2016 .",

The American College of Critical Care Medicine (ACCM) and the Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) course have published internationally recognized guidelines for the management and hemodynamic support of pediatric septic shock (Brierley et al. 2009; Kleinman et al. 2010a, b) . The two guidelines outline a similar step-wise approach to resuscitation directed at restoring physiologic indicators of perfusion: normal mental status, threshold heart rates, normal peripheral perfusion (cap refill <3 s), palpable distal pulses and normal blood pressure. The 'first-hour' therapeutic actions outlined in the ACCM guidelines should be regarded as best practices for emergency department resuscitation ( Fig. 8 .2). It has been shown that adherence to PALS-ACCM guidelines significantly reduces mortality and hospital length of stay (Han et al. 2003; Paul et al. 2012; Carcillo et al. 2009; Oliveira et al. 2008) .",

Initial therapy should begin with a bolus of 20 mL/kg of isotonic crystalloid solution infused over 5 min or as rapidly as possible, preferably with a manual \"pushpull\" technique or rapid infuser. Repeated 20 mL/kg fluid boluses should be given until markers of tissue perfusion (discussed above) normalize, or signs of fluid overload (lung rales, gallop rhythm, hepatomegaly) develop. Many children require up to 60 mL/kg within the first hour. Recently, a large trial in sub-Saharan Africa demonstrated increased mortality from fluid boluses in children with compensated septic shock (Maitland et al. 2011) . Although it is the only study of its kind to date, it highlights the potential for harm if fluid resuscitation is used indiscriminately in children in resource-poor settings with limited availability of mechanical ventilation and vasoactive support. The most recent PALS update maintains, that in resource rich settings, fluid resuscitation remains a key component of goal directed therapy but emphasizes the need for individualized clinical evaluation and frequent reassessments to determine the appropriate volume of fluid resuscitation in every patient (de Caen et al. 2015b, c) . Studies are currently underway to determine whether children in developed countries might benefit from fluid-sparing strategies.",

In addition to the above, neonates should be treated with ampicillin to cover for Listeria. Immunocompromised children at risk for pseudomonas infections should also be treated with broader spectrum agents including carbapenems.

Although central access is preferred, peripheral intravenous access can, and should be, used for initial vasoactive infusions (Brierley et al. 2009 ). Due to widespread availability and clinician familiarity, dopamine has traditionally been the first line vasoactive agent. However, recent evidence suggests that epinephrine is likely a safer and more effective first choice, especially for those with cold shock (Ventura et al. 2015) . According to the most recent ACCM guidelines, peripheral epinephrine is the preferred first line agent for fluid-refractory shock. Thereafter, cold shock should be reversed by titrating epinephrine (or low dose central dopamine), and warm shock reversed by titrating central norepinephrine (or high dose central dopamine). Please see Fig 8. 2. Patients with catecholamine-resistant shock often need a variety of vasodilators, afterload reducing agents and/or other vasopressors that should be titrated in an intensive care setting.",

A Cochrane review found there is no high quality evidence from randomized controlled trials to support or refute that specialist teams for neonatal transport reduce mortality or morbidity among newborns requiring retrieval to a newborn intensive care unit (NICU) (Chang et al. 2008 ). Nevertheless, specialized transport teams are recommended as being the best option for most critically ill infants and children who require inter-facility transport (Whyte and Jefferies 2015) . Ramnarayan et al. (2010) found that use of a specialized retrieval team was associated with decreased mortality risk in children transported to a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Orr et al. also found that children transported by specialized teams had a lower death rate of 9%, versus 23% for those transported by nonspecialized teams (Orr et al. 2009 ). They also found that nonspecialized teams who transport children have more significant adverse events including airway issues, cardiopulmonary arrest, sustained hypotension, loss of a crucial intravenous access and equipment failure with deterioration of patient status (Orr et al. 2009 ). Although the majority of critically ill children benefit from transport by a specialized team once they are stabilized at the referring centre, exceptions to this rule include children with epidural hematomas or bowel ischemia requiring emergent surgery. The relative benefits of immediate transport versus stabilization prior to departure should be carefully weighed in these children.",

Pain assessment tools are widely available and ideally should be used in triage as the first step in pain management (Srouji et al. 2010; Drendel et al. 2011) . Early use of pain assessment scores has been shown to increase provision of analgesia and decrease time to provision of analgesia (Boyd and Stuart 2005; Nelson et al. 2004 ). Measures of pain include physiologic measures (e.g. heart rate and blood pressure), observational and behavioral measures and self-report. Self-report is the gold standard as behavioral measures may also reflect anxiety and fear. Physiologic measures may reflect stress reactions and hence are often used as adjuncts to other pain assessment tools. The Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario pain scale is a widely used behavioral scale for younger infants and non-verbal children. Children as young as 3-4 years can self-report pain using visual scales such as the Faces Pain Scale (FPS-R), Wong-Baker FACES scale or the OUCHER pain scale. Numerical and 10-cm visual analogue scales are generally reserved for children older than 8 years with cognitive abilities to understand these abstract concepts (Srouji et al. 2010; Drendel et al. 2011 Local EMS and specialized teams may carry a wide range of medications depending on their protocols and scope of practices.

With a rapid onset of action (30 s), short duration of action (20-40 min) and lack of sedative properties at low dosing, fentanyl is an ideal agent for short painful procedures (Sahyoun and Krauss 2012) . Intranasal fentanyl is well tolerated and has been shown to be equally effective for pain reduction to intravenous morphine (Borland et al. 2007 ). Hydromorphone is a potent opioid with a longer duration of action and generally used for patients with poor response or habituated response to morphine (e.g. sickle cell patients) (Sahyoun and Krauss 2012) . Equipotent doses of all commonly used opioid agents produce similar degrees of nausea, vomiting, biliary tract spasm, pruritus, constipation and respiratory depression, however, individual responses may be variable and careful monitoring and titration of these agents is essential. Rigid chest syndrome with inability to ventilate a patient has been reported with large boluses of rapidly administered fentanyl, hence careful titration is necessary (Sahyoun and Krauss 2012) . Dosage guidelines for use of opioid for acute pain management are listed in Table 8 .4.",

Although some procedures such as venipuncture and intravenous cannulation are viewed as minor, they often result in significant distress and anxiety for children and their caregivers (Kennedy et al. 2008) . Even non-painful procedures for diagnostic imaging such as a CT scan which requires a child to lie motionless may provoke a high degree of anxiety. Other procedures such as fracture reduction and burn debride-ment are highly painful requiring a higher degree of analgesia and sedation. Procedural sedation is a technique whereby sedative or dissociative agents with or without analgesic agents are used to induce a state that allows a patient to tolerate unpleasant procedures while maintaining cardiorespiratory function (American College of Emergency Physicians 2014). It has increasingly been adopted by emergency physicians skilled in advanced airway management and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Safe sedation does require implementation of appropriate sedation guidelines and policies to minimize potential adverse effects (American College of Emergency Physicians 2014). Commonly used agents for minor procedures for anxiolysis with minimal sedative effects include midazolam (PO, IN) and inhaled nitrous oxide. Midazolam has no analgesic effects and hence requires additional analgesics for pain control. Intravenous midazolam is often combined with intravenous fentanyl and, with careful titration, produces more moderate sedation. Inhaled nitrous oxide is blended with oxygen and induces mild to moderate sedation and analgesia and has the advantage of onset and offset within 2-5 min. It is often used as an adjunctive agent for more painful procedures. Ketamine (IV, IM) is a dissociative agent characterized by potent analgesic and amnestic effects with relative lack of cardiopulmonary depression. It is a commonly used agent for procedural sedation in children and ideal for intensely painful procedures. Propofol is a deep anesthetic agent with rapid onset and pleasant recovery and is increasing being used in the emergency setting. It has a narrow therapeutic window and may result in significant respiratory depression and hypotension. It can be used alone for painless procedures requiring motion control such as CT scan and MRI, but additional analgesic agents are necessary for painful procedures (American College of Emergency Physicians 2014).",

Comparison between commonly used topical agents including amethocaine (4% tetracaine, Ametop\u2122), eutectic mixture of local anesthetics (lidocaine 2.5% and prilocaine 2.5%, EMLA\u2122) and liposomal lidocaine (Maxilene\u2122) are comparable in effectiveness with minimal side effects. Lidocaine-prilocaine requires an application time of 60 min and is associated with some blanching of the site, whereas amethocaine requires an application time of 30-45 min and can be associated with some erythema at the site (Ali et al. 2016) . Concerns have been raised with use of lidocaine-prilocaine in young infants for methemoglobinemia due to a reduced level of methemoglobin reductase. Hence, alternative topical agents or a single dose of 1-2 g lidocaineprilocaine cream with limited application time of 60 min should be considered (Taddio et al. 1998) . Liposomal lidocaine is a newer topical anesthetic with a shorter application time of 30 min and has been associated with higher cannulation success rates (Taddio et al. 2005) . Vapocoolant sprays are rapid acting evaporation-induced skin cooling agents that are also effective for reducing pain associated with IV cannulation (Farion et al. 2008) . LET (4% lidocaine, 0.1% epinephrine and 0.5% tetracaine) solution is a topical local anesthetic agent for laceration repair. It can be pre-pared by pharmacy or available commercially as a gel and is applied directly to wounds for 20-30 min. It is most effective on the scalp and face in producing wound anesthesia but also significantly reduces pain of subsequent injection of lidocaine if needed (Eidelman et al. 2011) . Generally, use of LET on mucous membranes or end organs such as fingers is avoided, but small amounts applied with a cotton tip have been shown to be safe and effective (Bonadio 1996; White 2004) . Pain associated with injection of lidocaine can also be reduced by slow injection, use of a fine needle and buffering with a solution of sodium bicarbonate (1 mL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate to 9 mL of 1% or 2% lidocaine) (Fein et al. 2012 ).",

Often referred to as 'accidents', most traumatic injuries represent discrete, potentially preventable events. Therefore, trauma has patterns, risk factors, and identifiable high-risk populations with preventative interventions. Traumatic injuries cost Canadian society millions of dollars annually (Public Health Agency of Canada 2015); leading causes include include motor vehicle collisions (MVC), pedestrians and cyclists struck by vehicles, suffocation, falls from height, fires, and drowning. Blunt trauma accounts for >90% of injuries in children. Children are at greater risk of serious injury than adults when operating all-terrain vehicles and snowmobiles (Yanchar et al. 2012 ).",

A significant proportion of traumatic deaths occur due to hypoxia, and adequate oxygenation and ventilation of the trauma patient is of paramount importance. Immediate placement of all trauma patients on a non-rebreather face mask with 100% oxygen should be considered. The patient should be assessed for bilateral breath sounds and signs of hemo-pneumothorax, such as uneven or decreased breath sounds and subcutaneous emphysema. Progressive buildup of air in the pleural space, often from a lung laceration, can lead to a tension pneumothorax. The 'one-way valve' effect can be exacerbated by positive pressure ventilation. Classic signs of a tension pneumothorax are tracheal deviation away from the side of tension, hyper-expanded chest with poor chest wall movements, decreased breath sounds and increased percussion note on the affected side, although these signs can be difficult to appreciate in a busy trauma bay. Increasing tachypnea, tachycardia and hypoxia should raise the suspicion of a tension pneumothorax. Left untreated, ensuing circulatory collapse with hypotension may lead to traumatic arrest due to impaired venous return to the heart (obstructive shock).",

Important anatomic differences that predispose children to C-spine injury include: ligamentous laxity, shallow angle of facet joints, relatively larger head leading to a higher rate of axial injuries in young children, and multiple vertebral ossification centers, all of which make radiological interpretation challenging. Risk factors for c-spine injury include: altered mental status, focal neurological deficit, neck pain, torticollis, substantial torso injury, predisposing condition (e.g. arthritis, Trisomy 21), diving, high risk MVC (Leonard et al. 2011) . Although a detailed discussion about clearing the pediatric cervical spine is beyond the scope of this text, clinical decision rules such as the NEXUS criteria may be helpful to aid in clinical clearance in a coop-erative child (Vinson 2001; Michaleff et al. 2012) . Plain films in children are about 90% sensitive for C-spine injury, and therefore should be the first imaging modality in alert, non-intubated children who cannot be cleared clinically. (Nigrovic et al. 2012 ). If the cervical spine cannot be evaluated as normal, it is advisable to keep the patient in a soft collar (or bags besides his/her head if the child is too small for a traditional collar) until detailed imaging (usually MRI) can be performed.",
