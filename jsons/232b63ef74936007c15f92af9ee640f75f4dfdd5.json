The model was trained and tested on experimental data on the relative immunodominance of CTL epitopes in Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection. The method is more accurate than publicly available models. Our model predicts that only a fraction of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes that have been predicted to bind to HLA molecules is immunogenic. The immunogenic CTL epitopes across all SARS-CoV-2 proteins are predicted to provide broad population coverage, but the immunogenic epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alone are unlikely to do so. Our model predicts that several immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 CTL epitopes are identical to those contained in low-pathogenicity coronaviruses circulating in the population. Thus, we suggest that some level of CTL immunity against COVID-19 may be present in some individuals prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Vaccination has led to the eradication of smallpox from the planet, the near-eradication of polio, and contributed greatly to the reduction in childhood mortality. Indeed, vaccination has saved more lives than any other medical procedure. Bringing the COVID-19 pandemic under control will likely require an effective vaccine. Thus, several urgent efforts to develop vaccines that may protect against infection by SARS-CoV-2 have been launched (Akst, 2020) . For example, Moderna has announced clinical trials of a messenger RNA-based vaccine that codes for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (Dunn, 2020) . Other ongoing efforts involve the use of non-replicating Adenovirus vectors containing the gene that encodes the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (Mak, 2020) . Both these approaches aim to elicit protective antibody responses. Whether these, and other vaccines in development will elicit protective immune responses, and how durable the protection will be, are not known.",

A recent report shows that the nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are over 90 % conserved compared to SARS-CoV, and the spike (S) protein is 76 % similar (Ahmed, Quadeer and McKay, 2020) . Most effective prophylactic vaccines elicit a potent antibody response directed against the spike proteins of viruses. But, a number of studies show that the antibody response elicited in patients infected with SARS-CoV was protective but relatively short-lived (Liu et al., 2006; Mo et al., 2006; Tang et al., 2011) , while T cell responses were durable (Fan et al., 2009; Tang et al., 2011; Channappanavar et al., 2014) . For example, Fan et al (Fan et al., 2009) showed that most patients who recovered from SARS-CoV have memory T cell responses directed against the virus 4 years after recovery. Tang et al (Tang et al., 2011) showed that 6 years after recovery SARS-CoV patients did not have significant amounts of virus-specific circulating antibodies, but had significant memory T cell responses compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, a critical role for virus-specific memory T-cells in broad and long-term protection against SARS-CoV infection has been elucidated in animal models (Zhao, Zhao and Perlman, 2010; Channappanavar et al., 2014) . Therefore, given the similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, it is worth exploring the development of vaccines that may elicit protective T cell responses.",

There is a great diversity of HLA genes in the human population, with each individual possessing 6-12 types of alleles (Bui et al., 2006) . Multiple recent studies have been focusing on discovering potential epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 that can elicit T cell responses. Ahmed et al (Ahmed, Quadeer and McKay, 2020) and Grifoni et al (Grifoni et al., 2020) have tried to identify peptides of SARS-CoV-2 that have high sequence identity with SARS-CoV epitopes. However, only a small number of SARS-CoV peptides that are experimentally known to elicit T cell responses in humans are shared by SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, these shared peptides are associated with a limited set of HLA molecules, thus providing poor coverage of the global population. Ahmed et al (Ahmed, Quadeer and McKay, 2020) and Prachar et al (Prachar et al., 2020) , among other groups (Campbell et al., 2020; Nerli and Sgourakis, 2020; Prachar et al., 2020) , also identified SARS-CoV-2 peptides that are capable of binding to HLA molecules, either based on MHC binding assay results or bioinformatic methods. By doing this, they identified a large pool of SARS-CoV-2 peptides that are associated with diverse HLA molecules, which cover a broad cross-section of the global population. But, binding to HLA molecules does not imply that the peptide epitope will elicit an immunogenic T cell response in humans (Yewdell, 2006) .",

To train and test our method we first studied another viral infection, Human Immune Deficiency Virus (HIV), for which well defined data on the relative immunodominance of T cell epitopes is available. The results suggest that our method is more accurate than the immunogenicity prediction tool publicly available on IEDB (Calis et al., 2013; Vita et al., 2019) . Furthermore, the nature of our model suggests that the algorithm should be able to predict relative immunogenicity of peptide epitopes derived from a variety of pathogens. Therefore, we applied our algorithm to identify immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 peptide epitopes. Our results show that only a fraction of peptide epitopes that are known to bind different HLA molecules is likely to be immunogenic. However, the set of immunogenic peptides still provides broad coverage of the global population. Given the low mutability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus so far, these results suggest that a whole proteome immunogen may be able to elicit potent T cell responses in diverse individuals. We also predict that the immunogenic CTL epitopes contained in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (immunogen in most current vaccine formulations) is unlikely to provide broad population coverage, since these spike epitopes are associated with limited number of HLA alleles. In addition, several predicted immunogenic peptide epitopes derived from the SARS-CoV-2 proteome are identical to those contained in the four human coronaviruses of low pathogenicity (HCoV) that regularly circulate in the human population. This result leads us to suggest that HCoV-specific memory CTL responses that can also target SARS-CoV-2 epitopes in immunogenic fashion may be present in some fraction of the human population even prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

For a thymocyte to mature into a peripheral T cell, it must bind to at least one of these peptides with an affinity that exceeds a threshold value, and not bind to any of them with an affinity that exceeds a higher threshold value (Daniels et al., 2006) . In past studies (Kosmrlj et al., 2008 (Kosmrlj et al., , 2009 Ko\u0161mrlj et al., 2010; Butler, Kardar and Chakraborty, 2013) , we developed a mechanistic understanding of how thymic development shapes the pathogen reactivity of the T cell repertoire in an organism. Extending these studies leads us to the seemingly counter-intuitive conclusion that T cells that bind to human peptides more strongly will also be likely to bind more strongly to pathogen-derived peptides. One simple way to understand this is by examining data in mice, which show that more self-reactive T cells are statistically enriched in more hydrophobic amino acids at residues that contact the HLA-bound peptides (Stadinski et al., 2016) . This is because TCR binding to HLA-bound peptides creates an interface from which water must be partially expelled. So, hydrophobic amino acids are more likely to favor formation of such an interface. But, this argument applies to both self and pathogen-derived peptides. Therefore, statistically, TCRs that bind more avidly to self-peptides should also bind more avidly to pathogen-derived peptides. There is some experimental evidence supporting this prediction (Mandl et al., 2013) . Based on these considerations, we include the term, ( , self), in Eq 1, which is the biochemical sequence similarity of peptide to peptides derived from the human proteome. These peptides are also gathered from IEDB database (Vita et al., 2019) (Methods) . Similar to Eq. 2, ( , self) is defined as the number of self peptides whose alignment score with is larger than a threshold value, :",

For the chronic infection group, the classifier has an AUC score of approximately 0.66. The superior performance in the acute infection dataset can be explained by the fact that, as HIV infection progresses, the virus mutates to escape CTL response, and as a result less immunodominant peptides are targeted by CTLs in the chronic phase (Streeck et al., 2009) . The performance of the current model is compared to a T cell epitope immunogenicity prediction model developed by Calis et al (Calis et al., 2013) , which is publicly available in IEDB. Our model shows superior performance as measured by the AUC (0.71 vs 0.57 for the acute group, 0.66 vs 0.34 for the chronic group; Fig 1) . We also evaluated the importance of each of the three terms of ( , ), the binding term, the term representing similarity to pathogenic peptides, and that representing similarity to human peptides by constructing partial models with one or two terms removed from ( , ).

Four common human coronavirus (HCoV), HCoV-229E(NC_002645.1), NL63(NC_005831.2), OC43(NC_006213.1) and HKU1(NC_006577.2) are responsible for 10-30% of upper respiratory tract infections in adults (Paules, Marston and Fauci, 2020) . Given that memory T cell responses are likely induced in at least a fraction of the human population infected by these coronaviruses, we wanted to explore whether such memory responses could theoretically be induced/expanded following infection with SARS-CoV-2. Thus, we employed our classifier to identify common immunogenic peptide epitopes between HCoV and SARS-CoV-2. We first gathered a set of 38 HLA class I alleles that represent more than 99% of the world. We then applied our classifier to all possible overlapping 8-11mers in the proteome of SARS-CoV-2 and determined that there are 2311 immunogenic CTL epitopes associated with those 38 HLA alleles. We then further determined the unique set of immunogenic peptides that were common between SARS-CoV-2 and the four common HCoV. We found 46 shared immunogenic peptides, which are associated with 31 HLA alleles (Supplementary Table S3 ). These HLA alleles cover 98.6% of the global population and 99.0% of US population. On average each of these alleles are associated with 5.6 immunogenic peptides. Given this level of overlap between immunogenic epitopes between HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2, one can hypothesize that CTL memory responses elicited by past infection with common coronaviruses could respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also accounted for the fact that each individual may have been infected by only a subset of the four less pathogenic coronaviruses. So, to determine a lower bound, we determined the immunogenic epitopes that are shared between SARS-CoV-2 and each of the four less pathogenic HCoV. The results are presented in Table 2 . On average, 19 epitopes are common with any one of the less pathogenic human coronaviruses. The results shown in Table 2 lead us to suggest that some fraction of the human population has memory T cell responses that may target immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 CTL epitopes.",

Specifically, we studied the peptides suggested by Ahmed et al (Ahmed, Quadeer and McKay, 2020) and Prachar et al (Prachar et al., 2020 ), but our model can be applied to filter peptides suggested by other groups. Our results suggest that only a fraction of the peptides that bind to HLA molecules are likely to be immunogenic. But, the combined set of SARS-CoV-2 peptides that we predict to be immunogenic among known HLA binders provides broad coverage of the global population.

It is important to further validate, and potentially elaborate, the model by testing against experimental data for diverse viruses. More data will also help improve the model. Currently the model contains two parameters and \u210e , which are the cutoff thresholds for similarity to self and pathogenic peptides, respectively. These two parameters are used for all HLA alleles. However, it is known that peptides bound to different alleles can use different peptide residues to make primary contacts with the TCR. So, a model with allele-specific similarity cutoff thresholds might improve the performance. This will require training our model against more extensive datasets. Since short peptides derived from the proteome do not carry long-range information about the pathogen, if our model is further validated and elaborated, it may be a useful and simple tool for rapid identification of immunogenic CTL epitopes contained in diverse new endemic-causing pathogens that will undoubtedly emerge in the future.",
