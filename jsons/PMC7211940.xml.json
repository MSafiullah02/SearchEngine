On March 19, Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards issued a proclamation to temporarily suspend some certification and licensure requirements for running COVID-19 assays. Now, laboratory personnel \u201cwho demonstrate molecular biology polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experience\u201d can legally run COVID-19 tests if they are supervised by a licensed physician or PhD with related lab experience, according to the proclamation (5).

Because the pathogen, labeled novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a single-stranded RNA virus, testers first isolate viral RNA from a nasal swab sample using an RNA extraction kit (6). Then they apply a solution of selected nucleotides and the enzyme reverse transcriptase to create complimentary DNA to the RNA. Finally, the DNA is amplified into many copies using a polymerase chain reaction in a quantitative PCR (qPCR) machine. A fluorescent dye in the PCR reaction specifically binds and illuminates SARS-CoV-2 gene sequences. So if the qPCR detects a strong fluorescent signal, the sample is positive for the coronavirus.",

To get around its limitations, UC Berkeley is temporarily extending the clinical lab\u2019s CLIA certificate into the larger Innovative Genomics Institute on campus, and will staff it with volunteer researchers who have the relevant skills to run the assay, supervised by a licensed medical laboratory scientist. Governor Newsom\u2019s executive order, as well as revised emergency guidelines from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), made the temporary extension possible, as Berkeley\u2019s CLIA-certified lab in the health center can extend its certification to another location on campus. The several medical laboratory scientists already working there will oversee at least 15 Berkeley postdoctoral molecular biologist volunteers, who will run the COVID-19 assays.",

Some testing centers made their own COVID-19 assays, choosing their preferred brand of RNA extraction kits, primers, PCR machines, and swabs, Schaletzky explains. Bespoke testing protocols must be granted emergency authorization by the FDA and cross-validated by an independent CLIA-certified lab. The problem is that once a testing protocol is approved, none of the reagents or equipment can be changed, not even by brand if the original supplier runs out. \u201cIf you run out of swabs, there\u2019s no way to suddenly accept a different kind of swab in your protocol according to the guidelines,\u201d Schaletzky explains. \u201cThat\u2019s what leads to the shortages we have, because it\u2019s not flexible.\u201d",
