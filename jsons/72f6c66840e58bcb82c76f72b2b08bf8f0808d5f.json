Second, data were collected anonymously, so we could not check the accuracy of the diagnosis reported by patients. Third, the sample size was small and the response rate suboptimal. Finally, as the diagnosis relied on detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal samples, suboptimal sensitivity of this test (as low as 60% in some reports) might have led to misclassification and diagnostic bias. 7 However, this preliminary report of an association between hypogeusia or hyposmia and COVID-19 diagnosis in patients with ILI suggests that these symptoms might be a useful tool for initial diagnostic work-up in patients with suspected COVID-19. These symptoms, which are easy to collect, could be used for mass screening, by professionals with limited medical knowledge, and through telemedicine. Larger prospective studies are required to confirm these preliminary findings.",

During the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in France, we noticed that many patients reported loss of smell (hyposmia) and taste (hypogeusia). We aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of these symptoms. Rennes, Angers, and Nantes are referral centres for emerging infectious diseases in western France (population catchment area includes 5 million inhabitants). The study was done from March 15-18, 2020, at which time there was no public awareness of the potential link between taste or smell disorders and COVID-19 (the first report 2 was on March 21). All patients who underwent tests for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal samples since Feb 16 were invited by e-mail or telephone to complete a web-based questionnaire comprised of four questions: Have you been diagnosed with COVID-19 following diagnostic screening? Did you notice a loss of smell during your disease? Did you notice a loss of taste? Do you regularly suffer from ear, nose, and throat (ENT) disorders? The study was approved by the Rennes University Hospital institutional review board. Informed consent was waiived.",

Hypogeusia and hyposmia were strongly associated with COVID-19 diagnosis, separately and combined, in patients with and without a medical history of ENT disorders (appendix p 2). The best performance was obtained with the combination of hypogeusia and hyposmia in patients with no medical history of ENT disorders, with a sensitivity of 42% (95% CI 27-58) and a specificity of 95% (90-98; appendix p 2).",

Taste and smell disorders have been associated with herpes zoster and HIV. 3,4 The neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2 might have a role in the pathophysiology of hypogeusia and hyposmia. 5 As the olfactory mucosa is located in the upper region of the nasal cavity, a direct or indirect effect of SARS-CoV-2 in situ might be another explanation for these symptoms. The prevalence of taste and smell disorders in patients with COVID-19 was estimated to be 5% in a previous study; 6 however, the data were retrospectively collected from medical files, which might have led to underestimation of the real prevalence. Indeed, these symptoms might not be spontaneously reported if not searched for.",
