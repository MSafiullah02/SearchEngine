More than two hundred-thousand people have died of the disease. Normal lives of billions of people around the world are disrupted. The global economic loss is incalculable. From where I am (Massachusetts, USA), universities have closed down since mid-March. Most researchers were sent to work from home, which means in-person lab research has to be abruptly halted. COVID-19 pandemic ruthlessly deprives us from some of the very basic activities that we take for granted living in a modern society, such as going to work, eating out with friends, and attending social gatherings. As painful as it gets, COVID-19 also serves as a wakening call that reminds us how fragile our society still is when challenged by a pandemic, and much is to be learned about infectious diseases since we still lack effective ways to eradicate them.",

Some of the earliest modern medicines are indeed plant natural products for treating infectious diseases. Plants have a lot to offer for treating COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, but it will require interdisciplinary research efforts to fully realize this potential. Second, the countermeasures that were quickly deployed against COVID-19 this time, including disease detection and potential treatments, are resulted from previous science and technology development in broad disciplines. This strongly advocates for not just maintaining but significantly increasing societal funding into basic sciences, including plant science, in order to better prepare us for future pandemics and other societal challenges alike. Last but not least, the global COVID-19 crisis exposed several weaknesses of human nature, and in many ways echoes other looming crises, such as climate change and food insecurity. Plant science could contribute to the solutions of these problems, but such effort needs to be integrated into a global grand strategy yet to be established.",

            "text": "Infectious diseases have afflicted humans since the hunter-gatherer days. When the agricultural revolution occurred around 10,000 years ago, the rise of densely populated communities greatly increased the chance of epidemics. Diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, influenza and smallpox became known during that time. Through trial and error followed by extensive empirical exercises, indigenous people around the world have independently discovered a plethora of medicinal plants for treating various infectious diseases. For instance, in central Africa, Ageratum conyzoides (billygoat weed) was used to clear parasitic worm infection (Wabo Pon\u00e9 et al., 2011) . A wide variety of medicinal plants were used for treating malaria, with Artemisia annua (sweet wormwood) native to China and Cinchona officinalis (Cinchona tree) native to South America being the most well known (Mohammadi et al., 2020) ( Figure 1A ). In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), elaborate multi-ingredient herbal remedies also emerged, most of which were indeed developed for treating infectious diseases, the primary cause of ailments in ancient times. As a prominent example, Treatise on Cold Pathogenic and Miscellaneous Diseases, regarded as a crown jewel among ancient TCM texts, was written by Zhang Zhongjing (AD 150-219) during the late Eastern Han dynasty when continuous wars and multi-year pandemics caused great human suffering and death ( Figure 1B ). Using a dialectic approach, Zhang Zhongjing systematically documented 113 herbal formulae and 397 therapeutic strategies for treating illnesses that were meticulously categorized by their differential disease manifestations and responses to alternative initial investigative treatments. The Treatise has since served as a cornerstone for TCM over the following two millennia.",

            "text": "The age of exploration led by the Europeans starting in the 15th century inevitably spread many infectious diseases globally. Without previous exposure, as many as 90 percent of the indigenous people inhabiting North and South Americas perished due to smallpox, measles and bubonic plague among other infectious diseases brought by the Europeans. Upon arrival at new continents, colonists encountered many indigeneous medicinal plants, which they then introduced back to Europe and other parts of the old world through trade. For instance, the miraculous antimalarial property of Cinchona tree bark was rediscovered by Spanish settlers in Peru in the mid-17th century. In the following years, Cinchona tree bark quickly became a highly prized medicine, and was traded globally. Driven by curiosity and the need to deter species adulteration in medicinal plant trade, the field of plant systematics flourished. This culminated in the publication of Species Plantarum by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, which established the foundation of plant taxonomy as we know it today. In addition, the growing interest in medicinal botany prompted the origins of botanical gardens in several European countries, so that plants brought back by the colonists from all over the world could be cultivated and studied. Long-distance maritime voyages also caused health problems, such as scurvy, a common disease among sailors in British Navy in the 18th century, manifested by deteriorating connective tissue. To find a cure for scurvy, James Lind, a naval physician, ran the first reported, controlled clinical trial in the history of medicine on the ship HMS Salisbury in 1747, and found citrus fruit to be an effective cure for scurvy. The rapid advances in medicinal botany and medical sciences for diseases during this period in turn protected the health of colonists when they continued to explore distant territories, contributing to the establishment of many colonial empires by the 19th century.",

            "text": "The mysteries behind many medicinal plants were ultimately resolved in the past two centuries when modern science took off. Quinine was isolated from Cinchona tree bark by French chemists Pierre-Joseph Pelletier and Joseph-Bienaim\u00e9 Caventou in 1820 with its chemical structure fully resolved a century later (Hoffmann, 2018) ( Figure   1A ). Quinine and its synthetic analogs became some of the earliest modern medicines for treating various diseases. Vitamin C, or chemically named as L-ascorbic acid in honor of its activity against scurvy, was discovered collectively by Hungarian biochemist Albert Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi and British chemist Norman Haworth in the 1920-1930s. Inspired by an antimalarial remedy documented in the ancient TCM text Prescriptions for Emergencies authored authored by Ge Hong (AD 284-346), Chinese phytochemist Tu Youyou identified artemisinin from sweet wormwood in the 1970s, which led to the development of a new antimalarial medicine that saved millions of lives. Using modern chemical biology approach, the action mechanism of artemisinin was recently elucidated, which entails activation of the signature endoperoxide bridge of artemisinin by heme iron enriched in Plasmodium falciparum parasite to form highly reactive radicals that in turn bind to numerous target proteins (Wang et al., 2015) . Medicinal plants not only have guarded human health against infectious diseases over millennia, but also played an important role in the modernization and globalization of human society in the recent centuries. As our scientific knowledge about plants grows, there is no doubt that we will continue to discover new plant-derived medicines.",

Scutellaria baicalensis produces baicalein and several related flavonoids, which are antiinflammatory agents acting upon the NF-\u03baB pathway (Hsieh et al., 2007) . In a recent preprint, baicalein was found to be a potent inhibitor of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, 3C-like protease, which could suppress the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells (Liu et al.) .

The unwillingness to take inconvenient near-term preventative measures to avert predictable long-term crises have hurt some countries during this pandemic. Moreover, when disasters hit, the tribalism nature of humans gets amplified, which hampers our species' unique strength of collaborating with each other. This is the exact opposite of what we need right now to defeat the virus. Although COVID-19 is already bad enough, I can't help thinking about other looming crises of similar nature. For example, we are currently on a trajectory towards continued atmospheric CO 2 concentration rise, global climate change, sea level rise, and ultimately, environmental and socioeconomic catastrophes.",

The COVID-19 pandemic also sounded the alarm for food insecurity. Temporary interruptions to the global food supply chain due geopolitical reasons or a pandemic like COVID-19 put food security at instant risk. In the long run, overpopulation, diminishing arable land, and climate change-caused plant productivity loss have been forecasting significant global food supply shortfalls as compared to demand in the future.",

            "text": "As a society, we must learn from where we succeeded and failed in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, and take these lessons to heart when addressing other global challenges facing mankind. Again, plant science is well poised to make important contributions to these challenges. Plants are primary sequesters of atmospheric CO 2 on Earth, using only sunlight as the energy input. For instance, engineering plants to accumulate inert carbon-trapping polymers such as suberin and sporopollenin can help rebalance the global carbon cycle. Developing crops with enhanced productivity, disease resistance, and abilities to withstand harsh environmental conditions will be critical to ensure future sustainability of humans on Earth. However, we need comprehensive collaborations at a global scale to integrate plant biotechnologies with other technologies and policies to create grand actionable mitigation strategies. As scientists around the world work collectively to defeat COVID-19, sharing their results with unprecedented transparency and speed, I see hope that united as one human race, we will overcome challenges lying ahead.

Numerous investigational drugs that recently entered clinical trials for COVID-19 are all repositioned from molecules previously approved or under investigation for other indications (ClinicalTrials.gov). A preliminary clinical study in France recently showed promising results of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in reducing the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in COVID-19 patients(Gautret et al., 2020).Interestingly, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are synthetic analogs of quinine(Figure 1A), and have previously been repurposed for treating HIV, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, in addition to their antimalarial use. Studies of the quinine scaffold showed that this class of molecules has the unique property to enrich in lysosome, which underpins their antimalarial and antiviral activities. Multiple clinical trials using chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 are currently ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov). In China, TCM has also played an important role in the battle against COVID-19. In late January 2020, the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (NATCM) organized an urgent study section to identify effective prescriptions of TCM for prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Based on symptoms observed in early COVID-19 patients, several TCM formulae were developed, among which the lung cleansing and detoxifying decoction (LCDD) was one of the most widely used, and clinically studied. LCDD is a combined formula developed based on four classical formulae described in the Treatise on Cold Pathogenic and Miscellaneous Diseases, and contains 21 ingredients: Ephedra sinica, Cinnamomum cassia (twig), Alisma plantago-aquatica, Atractylodes macrocephala, Bupleurum chinense, Scutellaria baicalensis, Pinellia ternate (pretreated with ginger and potassium alum), Aster tataricus, Tussilago farfara, Iris domestica, Asarum sieboldii, Dioscorea polystachya, Agastache rugosa, Citrus aurantium (dried young fruit), licorice (roasted), Prunus armeniaca (apricot kernel), ginger, orange peel, Wolfiporia extensa, Polyporus umbellatus and gypsum (CaSO 4 \u00b72H 2 O) (Figure 1B). According to a press conference held by the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council on April 17th (The State Council of China), the initial trial indicated that LCDD was effective on 90% of the 214 enrolled COVID-19 patients. LCDD was further trialed on additional 1262 patients, including 57 with severe symptoms. 99.28% of these patients have recovered by now, and none of the patients with mild symptoms developed into severe symptoms under LCDD treatment. On February 5th, NATCM officially recommended LCDD as a treatment for COVID-19. LCDD has since been widely used in 28 provinces and municipalities, and contributed to the relatively low mortality rate among COVID-19 patients in China.
