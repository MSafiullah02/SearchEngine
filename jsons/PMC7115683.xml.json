            "text": "Malaria is one of the most widespread diseases besides tuberculosis and AIDS which affects more than 500 million people worldwide and results in around 1\u20133 million causalities every year [1]. In Africa alone, around 20% childhood deaths are due to malaria and a child dies every 30 s [2] and it is estimated that an African child has on an average 1.6\u20135.4 episodes of malaria fever each year. Of the four typically recognized Plasmodium species causing disease in humans, Plasmodium falciparum is most deadly to children below the age of five leading to mortality while Plasmodium vivax is most morbidity prone, and is responsible for latent infection that hampers current control and future elimination efforts [3]. The development of drug resistance for the common antimalarials such as 4-/8-aminoquinolines, 4-methanol quinolines, antifolate drugs, sesquiterpene lactones etc. (Fig. 1\n) is a rather serious issue which has stimulated considerable research efforts in the development of new drugs using different approaches [4], [5] of which the molecular hybridization approach [6], [7] is quite an attractive strategy which involves design of new chemical entities by covalent fusion of two drugs, both active compounds and/or pharmacophoric units derived from known bioactive molecules with complimentary activities and multiple pharmacological targets. The multiple target strategy led to the design of hybrid of 4-aminoquinoline with species such as triazine [8], [9], ferrocene [10], rhodanine [11], thiazolidine-4-one [12], chalcone [13], trioxane [14], isatin [15] and recently, pyrimidines [16], [17], [18] (Fig. 2\n).",

On the other hand, pyrimidine-based compounds are well known for their wide range of promising antiviral [22], antitubercular [23], anti-AIDS [24], antinociceptive [25], antifungal [26], antitumor [27] and antimalarial activities [28] apart from their role in the nucleic acid synthesis.

In yet another report on the evaluation of quinoline\u2013pyrimidine, the activity (in micromolar range) was also reported for fixed combinations of the chloroquine and pyrimethamine. In all these reports, the pyrimidines were linked to the quinoline unit through 2-, 4- and 6-positions. We have employed rather conformationally flexible pyrimidine-5-carboxylates linked covalently to 4-aminoquinoline core. These novel pyrimidine carboxylate hybrids interact with the iron center of free heme within the physiological environment (pH 5.6), a key step in the accumulation of heme which is selectively toxic to the parasite. To enhance the possibility to accumulate within the digestive vacuole via weak-base trapping (the mechanism by which CQ and other quinoline antimalarials attain high concentrations inside this compartment), we developed a novel class of antimalarials using a pharmacophore hybridization approach in which the pyrimidine-5-carboxylate motif was hybridized with an iron-complexing, 4-aminoquinoline moiety through C-2 position [29]. To further elaborate the structure\u2013activity profile, here, we present additional new 4-aminoquinoline\u2013pyrimidine carboxylate hybrids. We also report on their antimalarial activity against both CQ sensitive (CQs Dd2) as well as CQ resistant (CQR D10) strains. Finally, the mechanism of action studies with the representative compounds has also been performed.",

Further, the introduction of nitro substituent at ortho position of the phenyl ring at the C-4 of the pyrimidine core furnished the most potent compound 6c with antimalarial activity superior to the standard CQ and close to artesunate [29].

Although the tested hybrids were not as active as the standard drugs viz. CQ and ASN, interesting SARs have been drawn. Analysis of the activity of the compounds recorded in Table 1 reveals that replacing C-5 ethyl ester of the previously reported [29] compound 6a [IC50 247.5 nM (CQS); 52.2 nM (CQR)] with methyl ester 5a [IC50 659 nM (CQS); 542 nM (CQR)] led to the decrease in antimalarial activity against both the chloroquine sensitive and chloroquine resistant strains of P. falciparum. However, comparison of hybrids 5b, 5c with 6b, 6c having an identical butyl spacer showed that incorporation of isopropyl ester at C-5 of pyrimidine motif (5b and 6b) increased the antimalarial activity against the CQS strain whereas considerable decrease in activity was observed for CQR strain of P. falciparum. Also, the most potent compound 5b of the series displayed 2-fold increase in antimalarial activity than the standard CQ against CQR strain of P. falciparum. When the diaminoalkyl linker of compound 6a was replaced with relatively less basic alkoxy amino linker 5d considerable decrease in antimalarial activity was observed which in turn linked to the decreased accumulation of compound via pH trapping into the digestive vacuole. It was not unexpected since the basicity of alkyl chain linker plays crucial role in determining the antimalarial activity of this class of compounds. Furthermore, the introduction of a nitro substituent on the phenyl ring at the C-4 position of the pyrimidine core to create 5c resulted in a significant increase in anti-plasmodial activity in comparison to the p-chloro/p-fluoro substituents (5e and 5f). Moreover, the hybrid 5g lacking a C-4 substituent on the pyrimidine motif led to an increase in antimalarial activity against both the CQS as well as CQR strains of P. falciparum. However, although the antimalarial activity of 5g was superior to 5c, 5e & 5f, it was less than the corresponding C-4 phenyl substituted analogs 5b as well as 6b.",

Compound 5d with alkoxy amino linker and compound 5g bearing C-4 unsubstituted pyrimidine motif exhibited high CC50 values and thus led to fairly safe selectivity index values (Table 1).

In this study, we have evaluated the mechanism of antimalarial activity of the most potent compound 5b of the series by studying its binding with heme [Fe(III)PPIX] in solution and inhibition of \u03b2-hematin formation using UV\u2013visible spectrophotometer. The incremental addition of 5b (0\u201325 \u03bcM) into monomeric heme (2.4 \u03bcM, DMSO:H2O/4:6, v/v) in 0.02 M HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) showed a substantial decrease in the intensity of the Fe(III) PPIX Soret band at 402 nm with no shift in the wavelength of the absorption maximum (Fig. 4\n). The titration of monomeric heme was also performed at the Plasmodial food vacuole pH 5.6 using MES buffer instead of HEPES to ensure that the compound 5b binds with heme even at acidic pH (S1). A 1:1 stoichiometry of the most stable complex of 5b with monomeric heme at pH 7.4 and 5.6 was established from the Job's plot (SI Figure S1). The association constants (Table 3\n) were calculated by analyzing the titration curves obtained at pH 7.4 using HypSpec\u2013a non-linear least square fitting programme [39]. The binding of CQ with heme under identical conditions was also determined in the similar manner and the results are presented in Table 3 for comparison. Table 3 shows that the association constants for the complexes formed between monomeric heme and 5b (log K 4.96) are comparable with those of standard antimalarial drug, CQ (log K 5.15). Furthermore, the decrease of apparent pH from 7.4 to 5.6 (Table 3) has little effect on the binding constants indicating binding is stronger even at acidic pH.",

Further, Job's plot calculations indicated a 1:1 stoichiometry for the most stable \u03bc-oxo: 5b complex (Fig. 7b). In Table 3 the association constants of 5b (log K 5.72) are compared to that of standard CQ (log K 5.58) and also suggests that the binding of 5b is stronger with \u03bc-oxo heme (log K 5.72) than monomeric heme (log K 4.96). Thus, the compound 5b inhibits hemozoin formation by blocking the growing face of heme resulting in the observed antimalarial activity. Furthermore, the \u03b2-hematin inhibition assay (SI Table S2) shows that there is no correlation between antimalarial activity and \u03b2-hematin inhibition and also, all the compounds inhibit \u03b2-hematin formation although less than that of standard CQ.",

            "text": "The mechanism of many antimalarial drugs such as CQ, quinacrine and quinine relies upon the interaction with DNA presumably through ionic interactions between phosphate groups of DNA and protonated amine in addition to the interactions between aromatic nuclei of the drug with nucleotide bases [40], [41]. Therefore, the DNA binding properties of 4-aminoquinoline\u2013pyrimidine hybrids have been evaluated using both the UV\u2013visible spectrophotometer and fluorescence spectrophotometry in order to probe interaction of these compounds with DNA. The addition of CT-DNA (4\u2013200 \u03bcM) to the buffered methanolic solution of 5b (30 \u03bcM) induced hyperchromic shift of 112% in absorption band at 255 nm whereas hypochromic shift of 37% in the characteristic quinoline ring absorption at 330 nm (Fig. 8\n). Also, the bathochromic shift of \u223c3 nm was observed for both the absorptions. The observed hyperchromic as well as hypochromic shifts in absorption bands of 5b upon addition of DNA results from the intercalation of 5b with CT DNA as suggested in the literature [42]. The intercalative nature of interaction of compound 5b with CT DNA was additionally supported by thermal denaturation experiment. Intercalation of molecules into the double helix is known to stabilize the DNA against thermal strand separation and thus increases thermal melting temperature (T\nm) [43], [44]. The derivative melting curve presented in Fig. 9\nshows an increase of 7.5 \u00b0C in thermal melting temperature of CT DNA upon addition of 5b which is less than that observed for the CQ (Table S3). Thus, both the UV\u2013visible titrations and thermal denaturation experiment advocate partial intercalative nature of interactions between compound 5b and CT DNA.",

Continuous in vitro cultures of asexual erythrocyte stages of P. falciparum were maintained using a modified method of Trager and Jensen [45]. Quantitative assessment of antiplasmodial activity in vitro was determined via the parasite lactate dehydrogenase assay using a modified method described by Makler et al. [46]. The test samples were prepared to a 20 mg/ml stock solution in 100% DMSO and sonicated to enhance solubility. Samples were tested as a suspension if not completely dissolved. Stock solutions were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C. Further dilutions were prepared on the day of the experiment. Chloroquine (CQ) was used as the reference drug in all experiments. Test samples were initially tested at three concentrations (10 \u03bcg/ml, 5 \u03bcg/ml and 2.5 \u03bcg/ml) to determine the starting concentration for the full dose\u2013response assay. CQ was tested at three concentrations namely 30 ng/ml, 15 ng/ml and 7.5 ng/ml. A full dose\u2013response was performed for all compounds to determine the concentration inhibiting 50% of parasite growth (IC50-value). Test samples were tested at a starting concentration of 10 \u03bcg/ml, which was then serially diluted 2-fold in complete medium to give 10 concentrations; with the lowest concentration being 0.02 \u03bcg/ml. The same dilution technique was used for all samples. CQ was tested at a starting concentration of 1000 ng/ml. Several compounds were tested at a starting concentration of 1000 ng/ml. The highest concentration of solvent to which the parasites were exposed to had no measurable effect on the parasite viability (data not shown). The IC50-values were obtained using a non-linear dose\u2013response curve fitting analysis via Graph Pad Prism v.4.0 software.",
