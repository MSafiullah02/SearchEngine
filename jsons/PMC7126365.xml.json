Recent assessments through the Global Burden of Disease Study now show that ODA largely worked, especially through major health initiatives to address HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and NTDs (e.g., PEPFAR, The Global Fund, and the USAID NTD Program) and the vaccine-preventable killer diseases of childhood (e.g., GAVI), with significant reductions in the prevalence and incidence of these conditions [2], [3], [4], [5]. For several of these diseases it is now even possible to consider elimination or even eradication strategies [6].",

Such forces might partly explain for example the recent occurrence of widespread Ebola in West Africa, cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Middle East, visceral leishmaniasis in East Africa, and chikungunya and Zika virus infections in the Americas [7], [12], while in Southern Europe vector-borne NTDs such as dengue, chikungunya, West Nile virus infections and even schistosomiasis have emerged [12], [13].

It was recently noted that (almost paradoxically and with a few notable exceptions) the majority of the poverty-related neglected diseases, including the NTDs, are today mostly prevalent among the poor living in group of 20 (G20) wealthy economies, together with Nigeria whose economy exceeds the bottom three or four G20 countries [1]. Based on data from both the WHO or the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013, the G20 nations and Nigeria account for more than one-half of the disability adjusted life years from the NTDs and most of the cases of diseases such as Chagas disease, dengue, helminth infections, leishmaniasis, leprosy, and even tuberculosis, among others [14]. Certainly the poor living in large middle-income countries such as Brazil, China, India, and Indonesia account for much of this NTD burden, but in addition there are pockets of intense poverty in the Southern United States, Europe, Saudi Arabia, and Australia fostering neglected disease burdens in selected areas [1]. Thus, with the exception of Ebola virus infection and a few other NTDs including African sleeping sickness, the poor living in G20 countries represent the next wave in neglected diseases highlighted above [1], [7].",

Such a fund they argue, beginning at the $2 billion level, would be essential to incentivize multinational pharmaceutical companies to embark on neglected and emerging vaccine development, while simultaneously ensuring a market for product sales [16]. The emphasis of such a fund would be to support emerging pandemic threats as well as some neglected disease pathogens [16]. Out of this proposal emerged a new initiative, known as the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), an initiative linked to WHO that would focus on gaps in product development resulting from market failure.",

Both CEPI and the Plotkin et al. proposal represent one approach to this problem, if it can overcome the multiple complexities associated with the launch and administration of a fund. Such complexities include the fact that the US Government is already the largest contributor to neglected disease R&D according to the G-FINDER Report, together with previous findings that it remains highly uncertain the US Government could tapped again for an additional research and development funds [17]. Also of concern are the governance and distribution mechanisms of a global vaccine development fund, including how the list of vaccines is prioritized, and whether the scientists and administrators from donor countries would be willing to cede control of funds to an international entity in Geneva or elsewhere.",

Specifically, national funds established in each of the G20 nations could support indigenous scientists and research institutes and incentivize them to partner with international industrial manufacturers and the half-dozen vaccine non-profit product development partnerships (PDPs), which are specifically focused on NTD and other neglected disease vaccines [1], [6]. Currently the Japanese Government\u2019s Global Health Innovation Technology (GHIT) Fund is one recent example of a national fund that simultaneously supports PDPs and Japanese academic, research, and industrial institutes. In this blue marble health model each national fund would similarly promote indigenous scientists and manufacturers, while simultaneously providing support for new neglected disease vaccines [1].",
