She had a medical history of hypertension and system lupus erythematosus. Laboratory tests showed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (20 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (10.23 mg/L) levels. Real-time PCR of the patient's throat swab was positive for COVID-19 nucleic acid. Chest CT showed multiple bilateral and peripheral ground-glass opacities ( Fig   1A) . Bedside LUS examination including all intercostal spaces was performed subsequently, which revealed multiple B-lines (B-lines total number: 88), small consolidations and pleural line thickening ( Fig 1B and C) .
