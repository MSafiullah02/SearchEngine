            "text": "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory infection caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 has a high transmission rate and is transmitted through respiratory droplets or close contact with an infected individual. The clinical symptoms of gastrointestinal symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, and diarrhoea [1]. In addition to studies on respiratory symptoms, recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection can also cause gastrointestinal symptoms [2,3]. A cohort study of 140 COVID-19 patients showed that gastrointestinal symptoms were observed in 39.6% of the patients, including nausea (17.3%), diarrhoea (12.9%) and vomiting (5.0%) [4]. Recently, atypical cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported [5]. SARS-CoV-2 infection manifesting as gastrointestinal symptoms may pose diagnostic and treatment difficulties and may result in medical workers being exposed to the virus unknowingly. A recent survey of 2,209 gastroenterologists in China showed that only 31% to 35% provided the correct answers on the clinical characteristics of the digestive system in COVID-19, suggesting that they did not know much about the symptoms that occur after digestive system damage [6]. Therefore, we determined that a retrospective analysis of cases might be useful for clinicians to identify the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms.",

All patients enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID-19 Patients (Trial Version 5) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine [1]. COVID-19 severity was classified as mild, moderate, severe, or critical. Patients in the severe and critical subgroups were deemed to have severe pneumonia, whereas those in the mild and moderate subgroups were deemed to have non-severe pneumonia.

This outbreak was found to be related to the pollution of water sources by SARS-CoV [7]. Gastrointestinal symptoms are a relatively common clinical manifestation of MERS [8]. In addition, viral nucleic acid was detected in the faeces of 14.6% of 823 specimens from 37 MERS patients [9]. SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the aforementioned coronaviruses and is known to also cause gastrointestinal symptoms. Zhong et al. [10] studied 1,099 COVID-19 patients and showed that only 3.7% had diarrhoea and 5% had vomiting. However, Fang et al. [3] showed that 79.1% of patients in the Wuhan area experienced gastrointestinal symptoms. In our study, 32.5% of COVID-19 patients had gastrointestinal symptoms, primarily inappetence (56.7%), diarrhoea (37.8%), and nausea (16.5%). Notably, abdominal pain and vomiting were rare. The incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 patients in the Wuhan area was significantly higher than the overall incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 patients across China, which may be related to the virulence of SARS-CoV-2. Wuhan is the epicentre of the outbreak, so COVID-19 patients in Wuhan were more critically ill than in other areas across China. SARS-CoV-2 evolved into two major types: L type with more aggressive and spread more quickly, and S type with evolutionarily older and less aggressive. Tang et al. showed that S type of the virus was observed in 3.7% of viral isolates in Wuhan and 38.4% of viral isolates outside of Wuhan, while L type of the virus was observed in 96.3% of viral isolates in Wuhan and 61.3% of viral isolates outside of Wuhan [11] Furthermore, our study analysed gastrointestinal symptoms occurring before admission, and gastrointestinal symptoms occurring during hospitalisation were not considered. Therefore, the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms in our cohort was lower than that reported by Fang et al.",

Compared to patients without gastrointestinal symptoms, patients with gastrointestinal symptoms are more likely to have severe COVID-19. A recent meta-analysis also showed that gastrointestinal symptoms were found to be associated with severe COVID-19 [12]. We speculate that gastrointestinal symptoms may be related to the degree of viral replication, with increased severity of disease associated with a high viral load. In addition, this result suggests that the correlation between gastrointestinal symptoms and systemic symptoms such as dizziness, myalgia, and fatigue observed in this study increases the difficulty of clinical diagnosis. One possibility is that the medical staff was trained to focus mainly on obvious respiratory symptoms, and extrapulmonary symptoms may be initially overlooked during the widespread outbreak.",

            "text": "The mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 causes gastrointestinal symptoms is unclear. There are several possible explanations for the gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Firstly, it has been shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a host cell receptor of SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 is highly expressed not only in alveolar epithelial cells but also in the epithelium of the oesophagus, small intestine, and colon [13], [14], [15]. Previous studies revealed that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV RNAs could be detected in the SARS and MERS patients\u2019 stool sample, respectively [16,17], suggesting that coronavirus has a tropism to the gastrointestinal tract. Similarly, gastrointestinal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in faeces has been reported [18]. Electron microscopy on autopsy specimens of COVID-19 patients also showed damage to the oesophagus, stomach, and intestines [19]. The tropism of SARS-CoV-2 to the gastrointestinal tract is associated to gastrointestinal symptoms. Therefore, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 attacks the gastrointestinal tract, which would explain the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 patients. These evidences have provided basis for its possible transmission route in faeces. Secondly, gastrointestinal symptoms may be a manifestation of an indirect or direct SARS-CoV-2 effects through the cytokine storm syndrome. Over-activated lymphocytes secrete a large number of cytokines, resulting in systemic inflammatory response syndrome, which causes inflammation and damage of the gastrointestinal tract [20]. Patients who experienced gastrointestinal symptoms exhibited higher CRP, lactate dehydrogenase, and \u03b1-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase levels. These data suggest a possible correlation between gastrointestinal injury and the inflammatory responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thirdly, gastrointestinal symptoms may be drug-induced. The side effect of drug treatment, such as antibiotic and antiviral, may be related to the gastrointestinal symptoms, yet whether it damages the digestive system in patients remains to be investigated.",

However, some enrolled patients in this cohort were diagnosed based on clinical diagnostic criteria, not the gold standard. During the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak, suspected cases with characteristic manifestations in CT scans were treated as confirmed cases even when the nucleic acid test was negative or unavailable [1]. Second, this study was the lack of the result of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the stool of COVID-19 patients, so we did not determine the hypothesis that the severity of gastrointestinal symptoms may be related to the presence of viral replication in stool. Third, our analysis was based on a retrospective study with a relatively small sample, which might cause bias and limit the reliability or generalizability of our results.",

Patients who experience gastrointestinal symptoms are more likely to suffer from severe pneumonia, which may help clinicians identify patients at high risk of COVID-19 and thus reduce the incidence of this condition.",
