The Reynolds number, based on the square cross section channel hydraulic diameter is 8888,13333 and 17777. Mean flow, Reynolds stress and POD are taken into consideration to investigate the flow characteristic with three different turning sections. Through analysis, a series of important conclusions have been drawn. For the main flow, the structure of turning sections has obvious influence on the characteristics of flow field. The size and number of vortices in the corner area are significantly reduced, because the increase in Reynolds number makes the influx impact stronger. It can be seen from the Reynolds stress distribution which is obviously different in different turning sections that the pulsation caused by the mixing of the main flow and the vortex is obviously stronger than that at the boundary. The flow at the turning section is complex, the distribution of the proportion of turbulent kinetic energy in the low-order mode is relatively gentle, and there is an obvious wavy structure at the turning section of the inner circle and outer circular passage, which matches the velocity field from the POD.",

            "text": "RANS method to study the effects of different Reynolds number and aspect ratio on flow and heat transfer in smooth rotating U-channel with small aspect ratio. In terms of experiment, in the early 21th century, many scholars [4] [5] [6] adopted the PIV method to study the flow and heat transfer in channel. YouQin Wang [7] compared the U-channel flow field structure measured by J. Martin [8] et al. using the PIV method through numerical simulation. Zhongyang Shen [9, 10] et al. studied the heat transfer and friction performance of U-channels with ribs, dimples, and protrusions through numerical simulation. It was found that the heat transfer effect of the outlet section was significantly stronger than that of the inlet section. There were phenomena such as separation, reflow and secondary flow in the turning section. The heat transfer effect of the rib-protrusion structure was much stronger than that of the rib channel under rotation, especially in the inlet section. C. Brossard [11] et al. used the PIV method to study the flow field characteristics of the rotating ribbed U-channel and found that the rotation caused the heat transfer characteristics of the leading and trailing sides of the channel to be inconsistent. M. Gallo [12] et al. studied the flow and heat transfer of a smooth U-channel with a 1:1 aspect ratio. They used water as the working medium and set up an 18D (hydraulic diameter) inlet section before entering the turning section. It was found that the heat transfer was obviously enhanced at the point of fluid impact; at the same time, the heat transfer was also enhanced to a certain extent at the position where the vortex was generated. M.Gallo [13] et al. also obtained the visualizations of the main and secondary flow fields in a U-shaped channel and perform a 3D reconstruction of the mean flow and vortical fields. J.Visscher [14] et al. investigated the massively separated turbulent flows with rotation by PIV. In addition to channel, PIV was applied into open-cavity flow by J.Basley [15] .",

Lei Luo [19] et al. numerically studied the effects of a dust hole and its location on heat transfer and friction in a U bend channel. Mokhtar.K [23] investigated the impact of ribs on the thermal performance of rotating U-type channel, In the current research, there are many differences in heat transfer law which cannot be explained, which is the result of different structure of U-shaped channel. The theory of the flow field is needed to explain, but it is difficult for the lack of flow data. There is little comparison in flow fields between different turning sections, so the research in this paper is needed.",

It will get a set of optimal bases called mode which occupy different proportions of turbulent kinetic energy in flow field after decomposing data through POD. This method is also commonly used to identify the structures of different energy levels in the turbulent flow field, and the structures with larger energy content are extracted for analysis. Yijia Zhao [25] et al. extracted the dynamic coherent structure using a new POD method named F-POD. F. Coletti [12, [26] [27] [28] et al. studied the turbulent flow inside a channel by means of time-resolved particle image velocimetry. Sen.M [29] et al. investigated a rough-wall turbulent boundary layer in a channel by using snapshot POD. Janiga [30] et al. characterized the dominant coherent flow structures in the entire three-dimensional domain using the 3D-POD technique. Zhao wu [31] et al. investigated the post-processor analysis of direct numerical simulation of a low momentum laminar jet via POD and Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). They found the POD was quite optimal in reconstructing the flow while the DMD required more modes in turn. Alvarez-Herrera.C [32] et al. studied the thermal convection in a thin two-plate channel and determined the dynamics of heat flow and energy distribution using POD. They found that when the energy was distributed among many POD modes, the fluid flow is disorganized and unsteady. In addition, POD is also used in many other fields. Banafsheh.B [33] et al. investigated the transient heat conduction in on-chip interconnects using POD method. Wu Jin [34] et al. studied the mechanism of unsteady cellular flame via POD.",

In 1987, he proposed the snapshot POD method, a new mathematical processing method, which is generally applicable to the case that the number of spatial points m is much larger than the sampling number N.

The air flows in from the inlet, and the flow field is uniform and smooth because of the settle section. After a period, when entering the turning section, the outer wall surface is right-angled, resulting in reflux. Therefore When airflow turns and passes through area 4, airflow will be far away from the inner wall due to centrifugal force, resulting in a low-pressure zone at inner wall in area 4, which leads to downstream airflow backflow. This is also the reason why backflow exists at the inner wall in outlet section. As can be seen from the contour, the recirculation zone of outlet section has been extended to area 7. The contour for mean velocity at Re=13333 in the circle-square channel is shown in Fig.  5 . The reason for the recirculation zone in area 3 is like the square-square channel and will not be described here. When the airflow passes through the area 4, the airflow will be away from the inner wall surface due to the centrifugal force, thereby forming a low-pressure zone in the inner wall surface of this area, causing the downstream airflow to flow back. Since the inner wall of this channel has a circular structure, the backflow is hindered, so the recirculation zone exists only in the downstream. At the same time, the circular inner wall surface structure of the turning section causes the pressure reducing area at this point to be smaller than the square-square channel, the upstream and downstream pressure difference is reduced, and the reflow tendency is weakened, so only area 5 and 6 have a recirculation zone. The contour for mean velocity at Re=17777 in the circlecircle channel is shown in Fig. 6 . Although this channel has no corner area, there is still a backflow phenomenon in the area 3 near the outer wall surface, and no reflow occurs in the area 5. The reason for the recirculation zone in the area 4 is like the circle-square channel and will not be described here. Fig. 4 to Fig. 6 , the flow field in the turning section of the three structures is quite different. The circular structure is more consistent with the curved flow field caused by centrifugal force, and it is less likely to generate vortex in the corner and inner wall. In order to better compare the influence of different structural turning sections on the flow field, the velocity profile of some specific sections will be analyzed. We need to extract the speed from the contour and then perform dimensionless. Before that, we need to calculate the mainstream average speed under different Reynolds numbers. The specific parameters can be seen in Table 3 . It can be seen from Fig. 7 that the velocity profile (c)(f)(i) intercepted at the turning section of the three channels with different Reynolds numbers has a high similarity. There is a peak in the velocity profile at the inner wall surface, indicating that there is one vortex here in Fig. 7 (c). Fig. 7 (a)(d)(g) gives the velocity profile at the exit section of the three channels. In general, the streamlines of the three structures here are roughly similar, except that the position of vortexes on the inner wall of different structures leads to different flows on the near wall. Fig. 7 (b)(e)(h) shows the velocity profile at the inlet section of the three channels. Although the Reynolds number is different, the velocity pattern has a high similarity. The reason for the existence of a maximum value and a minimum value near the outer wall surface in the case of Re=8888 and 13333 (Fig. 7(e) )is that there exists recirculation zone. When the Reynolds number is increased to 17777, there is no recirculation zone, so there are no minimum values and maximum values. ",

The extreme value of the Reynolds stress exists in the middle position of this area, because the flow here is more complicated, the turbulence is higher, and there is a vortex structure on the inner wall surface, so the turbulence Pulsation is enhanced. The reason why there is a maximum value of the Reynolds stress near the inner wall surface of the circle-square channel is that the main stream is close to the wall surface, and the disturbance is increased, which is consistent with the cause of the other maximum value near the outer wall surface. For the circle-circle channel, the Reynolds stress is positive and there are three maximum values. It can be seen from Fig. 9 that the Reynolds stress distribution at the turning section of this channel is special, and the Reynolds stress in the upstream region near the inner wall surface is positive, and there is a stripe turbulent structure; the downstream regions are all negative, and similar stripe structure.

            "text": "We decompose wall-normal velocity component here, as it reflects micro flow features of various modes more clearly [26] . By capturing these features, it is possible to obtain flow characteristics of various mode that account for different flow kinetic energy ratios. The low-order mode captures most of the energy of the flow field, which also determines the basic state of the flow. High-order modes capture less energy and are small-scale coherent structures. In the real flow field, the more complex the flow distribution, the more modes are needed to capture a certain amount of energy. Considering that the flow field of the turning section is the most complicated in the U channel, POD analysis is performed on this section (area3,4,5). This paper presents the POD analysis contour of wall-normal velocity component with streamline distribution to better reveal the flow distribution of each mode. Since each mode contains different energies, the legend for the analysis results will be adjusted for different situations. This analysis selected different Reynolds numbers for different channel: Re=8888 square-square channel, Re=13333 circle-square channel and Re=17777 circlecircle channel. Fig. 10 to Fig. 12 show the modes of the square-square channel in the 3, 4, and 5 area of Re=8888, where (a) to (d) are the first, fifth, fifteenth, and thirtieth modes respectively, (e) is the average of wall-normal velocity field. In order to more clearly compare the different Reynolds stresses of different structures, we select more representative area 3, 4, and 5 and give contour maps. Different from the area 3, the velocity direction of 1st mode in the area 4 is roughly opposite to the mean flow. The fifth mode has two symmetrical vortex structures (\u03b1 = 9.4), and in the 15 and 30 modes, smaller scale vortexes appear. The velocity core of the 1st mode in area 5 is further downstream than the mean flow. the backflow on the inner wall surface is more obvious. In the mean flow, there is only one large-scale vortex in the corner. In the contrast, there are many small-scale vortices in the 5 th mode. The main reason is that the turbulent energy dissipated, and the large scale gradually breaks into small scale. For the 15th and 30th modes, the number of small-scale vortices is more, and not only in the corner. Table 3 shows the number of modes and ratio mode numbers of the three area in the square-square channel at Re=8888 when capturing 95% of energy. Approximately the first 36% mode can basically characterize the information of the flow field. Fig. 13 to Fig. 15 show some modes in area 3, 4, and 5 of the circle-square channels at Re = 13333. For the first mode, except for the presence of a vortex in the corner, the other phenomena are significantly different from the average flow field. For the second mode, the corner vortex is not obvious. On the contrary, there are small-scale vortexes structure on the boundary between the main flow field and the corner vortex. For the 5th and 10th modes, the vortex structure distribution is more dispersed and the scale is smaller. For the area 4, the flow at the turning section is more complicated than that of the area 3 region. The obvious difference between the low-order mode and the mean flow is the result of that the turbulent energy is not concentrated in the low-order mode. The flow field near the inner wall of the 1st mode is like stripe. In the contrast, the whole flow field near the outer wall is not. In the high-order mode, the flow field has a low ratio of turbulent kinetic energy, and its stripe structure is not obvious. The inner wall surface of this channel has a circular structure which blocks the backflow of the downstream flow, so there is no vortex. According to the mean flow field in the area 5, only one vortex is generated in the corner. However, it can be seen from the POD decomposition results that there are a lot of small-scale vortexes, which do not only exist in the corner area. Table 4 shows the number of modes and ratio mode numbers of the three area in the circle-square channel at Re=13333 when capturing 95% of energy. Approximately the first 43% mode can basically characterize the information of the flow field. Fig. 16 to Fig. 18 show some modes in area 3, 4, and 5 of the circle-circle channels at Re = 17777. As can be seen from Fig. 16 , the result of the 1st mode in circle-circle channel is quite different from the mean flow. The first mode has a distinct velocity boundary near the wall, and the velocity signs on opposite sides of the interface are opposite and the values are approximately equal. This phenomenon does not exist in the subsequent modes, but the vortex structure gradually appears, and two vortices are apparently present in the fifth mode. A similar stripe structure exists in the circlesquare channel of area 4. In high order modes, turbulent kinetic energy gradually dissipates, and stripe structure is no longer obvious. Fig. 18 shows the POD analysis results of the modes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 and 15 in area 5. The first mode has a velocity boundary at the lower left corner, and the speed signs on both sides are opposite. There is a large area of negative velocity region outside the interface, which is exactly the opposite of the mean flow field distribution. For the 3rd and 5th modes, there is a velocity boundary like the area 3, and the velocity distributions on both sides of the interface are opposite in sign and equal in value. Different from the area 3, the area 5 have interface in the 3rd and 5th modes, and the area 3 have only appeared in the 1st mode. For the 10th and 15th modes, the velocity boundary still exists, but the large-scale vortex structure on both sides of the interface gradually breaks into small-scale. It is assumed that this velocity boundary is due to the secondary flow. ",
