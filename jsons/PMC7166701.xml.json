The whole process of assembly and budding is coordinated by NP, VP24, and VP40, and enhanced by GP.74 NP binds to the viral RNA and creates RNP complex with polymerase L and viral proteins VP24, VP30, and VP35.75 VP30 and NP play an important role in the RNA\u2010binding activity.75 The multifunctional protein, VP35, suppresses host\u2010innate immunity and has been found to be involved in transcription/replication processes together with nucleocapsid assembly.76, 77 The interactions between these proteins (ie, NP\u2010NP and NP\u2010VP35) are essential to regulate the formation of the EBOV replication complex for efficient transcription/replication. Blocking this nucleocapsid formation by protein\u2010protein interaction inhibitors can lead to potential inhibition of EBOV. for example, VP35\u2010derived peptide (first identified NP ligand) that specifically binds to NP, blocks NP oligomerization and causes the release of RNA from NP\u2010RNA complex.78, 79 Other studies identified 18\u03b2\u2010glycyrrhetinic acid and licochalcone\u2010A80 to potentially disrupt the association of NP\u2010RNA complexes, aptamers,81 pyrrolidinone compounds,82 and recently MCCB4 (ene\u2010thiazolidinedione group\u2010containing compound),83 that specifically lead to specific VP35\u2010NP interaction.

Given an enormous amount of data through a vast array of DNA sequencing techniques available, experimental structure identification techniques require attention.180 Computational techniques are actively exploited in the pharmaceutical industry for the prediction of 3D protein models.124, 168 To expand the scope of computational methods and to improve model accuracy, efforts are being made continuously. These approaches help to predict the tertiary structure of a protein through its amino acid sequence to combat this issue.176 Depending on the available information, these methods can be characterized as either de novo or homology modeling. Template\u2010based modeling also referred to as homology modeling or comparative modeling, is the most trusted method for model design.176 Similar folding properties of the members of a protein family with the core structure unaffected by modifications in the sequence are fundamental criteria governing homology modeling.181 Models are generated given target\u2010protein sequences and X\u2010ray, cryo\u2010EM, or NMR\u2010determined structures. Even with a low sequence similarity (~20%), accurate models can be obtained using homology modeling.182, 183, 184, 185 For this, a template structure is initially selected to identify similar experimentally determined structures, after which template\u2010target sequence alignment is performed. The 3D model is then energetically refined to optimize model quality. The refinement of the model includes optimizing bond lengths and angles and removing clashes in geometry. If required, additional structural modifications can be applied, until a relevant and accurate model is obtained. However, the refinement of the model often does not meet the desired level of accuracy.186 A number of potential in silico studies have been documented over last few years which include homology modeling of unresolved EBOV polymerase187, 188 and docking\u2010based virtual screening of compounds that have potential to bind with important residues lining the binding pocket of EBOV VP40, VP24, VP30, and VP35.82, 108, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194\n",

Later, the in silico refinements of these compounds using MD revealed the interruption of key interactions between sulphonamide ligands and the receptor due to an additional water molecule. The migration of this water molecule from outside explained the reduced activity of these compounds when tested experimentally.196 In another study by Cavalli et al,197 MD simulations were used as a platform to discern several different docked complexes of propidium and human acetylcholinesterase and most stable structures identified which correlated with the experimentally verified binding modes.",

Based on the hypothesis of the influence of induced fit in enzymes, the normal\u2010mode analysis could prove to be helpful in the elucidation of the collective motions of protein domains that underlie their conformational changes upon binding a ligand.224 In other research, slow motions have been extracted from MD trajectories by using principal component analysis and MD simulation clustering.225, 226 The same technique might be incorporated in the elucidation of interacting amino acids of the target with the ligand of interest, as described using per\u2010residue energy decoupling.
