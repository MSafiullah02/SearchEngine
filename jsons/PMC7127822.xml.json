            "text": "Microbiological and molecular research has revolutionized our understanding of the causes and mechanisms of infectious disease; however the quantitative dynamics of pathogen transmission, a key process that drives the likelihood and extent of epidemic outbreaks and pathogen evolution, is still not well understood. It is crucial to recognize that severity of disease is not necessarily correlated with transmission. For example, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, caused by the measles virus years after the original symptoms occur [1], is a severe and often fatal disease, but has little impact on population level dynamics because there is no transmission of the virus. And the converse can be true \u2013 someone can be highly infectious yet show few disease symptoms, as in \u2018superspreading\u2019 events during the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic 2, 3. SARS is a rare example of a pathogen where many of the transmission events in an emergent epidemic were recreated from contact tracing [4]. Molecular techniques are now also used to trace a chain of transmission based on sequence similarities [5]. However, large-scale transmission experiments, such as those carried out with influenza virus in ferrets 6, 7, are the ideal way to gain insight into biological processes that drive the transmission process. Unfortunately, for economic and ethical reasons, they are difficult to conduct on a sufficiently large scale to fully quantify transmission for the range of important pathogens.",

Mathematical models are a powerful tool here, allowing the researcher to integrate the many disciplines, including virology, immunology, viral and host genetics and behavioral sciences, that contribute to our knowledge of viral transmission. Epidemiological modeling and analysis is one way to assess correlation between data from these various fields. For example, the probability and rate ratios of transmission per contact event during different stages of HIV infection were estimated using Poisson regression. Statistical models were then used to identify co-variates that were associated with higher transmission. These included high viral load, genital ulcers and young age [8]. Population-level ecological modeling of disease dynamics has also influenced disease control policy for human and animal infections, such as identifying the proportion of a population that needs to be vaccinated against a diverse range of infections 9, 10.",

            "text": "The most basic population-level epidemic model for viral infections is the compartmental, ordinary differential equation, the SEIR model, which tracks the proportion of a population in four classes \u2013 susceptible, exposed, infected and infectious, and recovered and immune \u2013 over time (Figure 1, Figure 2\n; Box 1\n). The SEIR model captures the epidemic dynamics of measles well [11]. Measles is an acute infection, and virus shedding occurs for a defined and relatively constant period in most infected persons, so estimating the rate at which individuals leave the infected and infectious class is possible. Further, the characteristic clinical manifestations of measles also make historical epidemic patterns based on disease notification relatively reliable. Measles also induces lifetime immunity, consistent with the assumption that once individuals recover, they never return to the susceptible class. Furthermore, the measles virus does not evolve quickly to escape immunity in previously infected hosts [12]. Thus, there is no return of individuals from the recovered class to the susceptible pool. The basic SEIR model goes a long way in explaining measles and other childhood disease dynamics 13, 14, 15. The SEIR assumptions do not fit most other viral infections, however. Different viral strategies interact with behavioral and genetic heterogeneities in host populations to create transmission dynamics that are not as well explained with a simple SEIR model. Before exploring important features of hosts and pathogen biology that drive epidemic dynamics, we review the biological underpinnings of key parameters of the basic model.Box 1The equations behind the SEIR modelThe basic SEIR model is a deterministic, ordinary differential equation model that tracks the progression of individuals through four classes \u2013 susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered \u2013 over time. The rates of change in the sizes of each class are functions of rate parameters (\u03bc, \u03b2, \u03c3 and \u03b3) (see Table 1 in main text) and the current sizes of each class, as expressed by the following system of equations:(1)dS/dt=\u03bc(N-S)\u2212\u03b2(t)SI/N\n(2)dE/dt=\u03b2(t)SI/N\u2212(\u03bc+\u03c3)E\n(3)dI/dt=\u03c3E\u2212(\u03bc+\u03b3)I\n(4)dR/dt=\u03b3I\u2212\u03bcI\n(5)\u03b2(t)=\u03b20(1+\u03b21 cos(2\u03c0t))\nThe model can be expressed in absolute numbers of individuals in each class, in which case N is the population size. Alternatively, it can be expressed as proportions of the total population in each class, in which case N is 1. When N = 1, as was used in the simulated epidemics shown in Figure 1 (of main text), the mixing term \u03b2(t)SI represents pseudo-mass action. The minimum population size necessary to maintain the expected number of infections >1 is equal to the inverse of the infected proportion at the bottom of a trough. R0 was kept approximately constant by maintaining \u03b20/\u03b3 = 17.123, a value that illustrates epidemic cycles well and is realistic for some infections. The basic equations can be changed to emphasize other aspects of disease transmission. Two modifications shown in Figure 1 (of main text) are the carrier and SEIRS models. The carrier model allows for two infectious classes that have different infectious periods, \u03b3 and \u03b32. The \u03b20 for this model is chosen such that 0.99(\u03b20/\u03b3) + 0.01(\u03b20/\u03b32) = 17.123. Mathematically, dI/dt is replaced by the following two equations:(6)dI1/dt=0.99\u03c3E\u2212(\u03bc+\u03b3)I\n(7)dI2/dt=0.01\u03c3E\u2212(\u03bc+\u03b32)I. \u03b20=150.7841\nIn the SEIRS model, individuals can lose immunity and return to the susceptible class at rate \u03c1. The modifications to the basic model involve replacing dS/dt and dR/dt with the following:(8)dS/dt=\u03bc(N-S)\u2212\u03b2(t)SI/N+\u03c1R\n(9)dR/dt=\u03b3I\u2212(\u03bc+\u03c1)I\n",

For example, a large value of \u03b2 could come from a highly susceptible na\u00efve host, a highly infectious host, or a highly infectious virus.

It is also possible to model death caused by disease by incorporating a case fatality rate, usually denoted \u03b1; however, we do not include this in the models in Figure 1. Not all infected individuals are in the infectious class. People who have been infected but cannot yet transmit are in the \u2018exposed\u2019 class. The rate of movement out of that class defines the latent period, (\u03c3\u22121). The SEIR model accounts for this latent period, whereas the simpler SIR (susceptible, infectious and recovered) version does not. Viral replication rate, tissue tropism, host behavior, genetics and immune response all affect the potential to transmit.

Population genetic studies have identified polymorphisms in the human population in both regulatory and coding regions for many of the genes associated with viral clearance, including IL-10, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 (tumor necrosis factor \u03b1) and TNF-\u03b2 29, 30. Individual hosts are not static in their susceptibility to infection over time. Malnutrition has long been linked to susceptibility to infectious disease. There is an association between decreases in solar radiation or nutritional intake of vitamin D through cod liver oil and higher incidence of respiratory infections, in particular influenza [31]. Moreover, an intriguing study on selenium suggests that its deficiency allows coxsackievirus and influenza to evolve a higher level of virulence in malnourished hosts [32]. Polymicrobial infections are the rule, not the exception [33], and it is possible that they affect susceptibility to a secondary infection and the ability to clear either infection.",

They can also affect the stability of the system, altering the likelihood that small perturbations drastically change the population dynamics [36].

Host population size is important in maintaining a chain of transmission through these troughs; however, small populations can still allow for disease persistence. One possible explanation for this is immigration: an infected host from outside comes into the population and starts a new round of infections, as seen in measles 11, 38. Another explanation is that a different host species can act as a reservoir for the virus, which could be the case with Ebola virus [39]. A third explanation is the presence of a low proportion of carriers, which can allow persistence even in small populations (Figure 1, Figure 2), as might be the case with foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) [40].

With these two parameters known, the probability of emergence and relative fitness of different viral strains can be estimated by calculating R0. As described, however, heterogeneities in the host population can significantly affect these estimates and the resulting dynamic behavior of epidemics and response to control. To incorporate these important heterogeneities, the well-mixed, basic SEIR model family must be extended to include variability in demographics, host age structure, genetics and social behavior. Modeling techniques for incorporating variability are well studied [9]; however, there is little work that empirically relates population heterogeneity to variation in transmission.",

Some contact events are short-lived, whereas some are constant or intimate. Allowing for the focus of transmission to be in schools in the SEIR model created a good fit for the measles data in a variety of settings, indicating that school term forcing is a crucial step in maintaining a measles epidemic [48]. Some aspects of behavior cannot be accounted for in a well-mixed SEIR model, however. Network models that incorporate assortative and disassortative mixing (whether people tend to contact people similar or dissimilar to them more frequently) have shed light on the dynamics of the high prevalence of HIV infection in minority populations in the United States [49] (M. Morris, pers. commun.). Other models involving contact networks have suggested the importance of the structure of a social network for determining the probability of an epidemic or the efficacy of a vaccination strategy [50].",

But understanding the population-level effects of these molecular, cellular within-host and between-host properties remains a challenge. Modeling studies that incorporate more of these fields show promise in answering these questions. SEIR models and their variants can reflect loss of immunity and carrier states. Social network models reflect the reality of different levels of contact among members of a population.

A transient period of 190 years, not plotted here, was run to move the dynamics onto a stable limit cycle. The proportion of the population infected is plotted as a function of time in years. All simulations were run according to variants of the SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered) model (Box 1). The model was seasonally forced using a sinusoidal function with a period of one year for more realistic dynamics by varying the transmission coefficient according to \u03b2(t). Seasonal forcing is a common phenomenon in childhood infections for which the dynamics are dependent on annual school term cycles. The transmission coefficient, \u03b20, and the infectious period, \u03b3\u22121, were adjusted for each model to maintain approximately constant R0, as calculated assuming the sinusoidal term in \u03b2(t) = 0. The parameters, unless otherwise specified were: N = 1, \u03b3 = 73, \u03c3 = 45.625, \u03bc = 1/45, \u03b20 = 1250, \u03b21 = 0.1, \u03c1 = 1. See Table 1 for units and biological interpretations of the parameters. (a) A standard SEIR model for an acute infection with seasonal forcing. The acute, SEIR epidemic model is shown in red in (b), (c) and (d) to highlight the differences. (b) A standard chronic infection with \u03b3 = 1, \u03b20 = 17.12329. (c) The carrier model divides the infected class into two groups, those who carry and those who clear the infection. This graph shows the effect of having 1% of the population as carriers, maintaining the infection chronically with \u03b20 = 150.7841 and \u03b32 = 0.1 or an infectious period of ten years. This has two noticeable effects on the epidemic curve. First, the number of infected individuals at any time is increased. Second, the depth of the troughs (difference between the maximum and minimum number of infected individuals) is smaller in the model with carriers than a homogeneously acute infection (trough depth 0.000202 and 0.00119, respectively). The minimum population size to maintain the expected number of infecteds > 1 is 1004 with carriers, versus 22 975 for the homogeneous acute system. (d) The SEIRS model incorporates a loss of immunity and return to the susceptible class. Loss of immunity in an acute infection results in no longer having biannual cycles, just seasonally forced yearly fluctuations and an overall increase in disease prevalence compared with the acute infection model.",
