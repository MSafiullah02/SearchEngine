In this time of uncertainty and fear, it is difficult to remain objective and to critically evaluate the scientific merit of the available new information. The peer review system by experts has been and needs to continue to be a pillar of scientific progress. It is important to point out that information from well-regarded previously published peer-reviewed publications on previously known Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus is used as the basis to further explore the SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms of infection and to search for novel therapies.",

SARS-CoV-2 may reach the brainstem through a neural route from lung chemoreceptors, severely affecting the cardiorespiratory center (Li et al. 2020a) . This suggests that the acute respiratory failure in some COVID-19 patients may have a central origin (Li et al. 2020a ). SARS-CoV-2 may also injure olfactory nerve terminals in the nasal cavity, explaining both the anecdotal and the recently published observations of associated decreased sense of smell in COVID-19 patients (Yeager 2020a; Rabin 2020; Lechien et al. 2020) . It is of note that olfactory deficits have been previously reported for several viral infections including coronavirus (Suzuki et al. 2007) , and are characteristic of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (Marin et al. 2018 ).",

ARBs reduce inflammation and endothelial and epithelial dysfunction in many organs including the lung, protecting its endothelial barrier integrity (Fedson 2016). There is substantial clinical evidence indicating that ARBs protect the lung from severe injury associated to pneumonia, sepsis, influenza, and chronic pulmonary disease, improving overall pulmonary health (Fedson 2016; Mortensen et al. 2012; Soto et al. 2017; Kim et al. 2016; Chang et al. 2015) and reduce SARS coronavirus-induced lung injury (Kuba et al. 2005) . Furthermore, mortality was reduced in patients previously treated with ARBs for cardiovascular disorders and later hospitalized for pneumonia (Fedson 2016). Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that ARBs may ameliorate pneumonia in COVID-19 patients, since recent studies have reported that ARBs improve the overall clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients with hypertension (Meng et al. 2020 ).",

From the above, and although prevalence data are not available, it is reasonable to assume that a significant proportion of patients affected with cardiovascular, brain, and metabolic disorders are currently medicated with ARBs. And since these illnesses are frequently comorbidities in COVID-19 patients (Li et al. 2020b, c, d; , we can make a reasonable assumption that many COVID-19 patients have been medicated with ARBs at the time of their diagnosis.",

This proposal is substantiated by the report of marked increases in Angiotensin II plasma levels in COVID-19 patients, linearly associated to viral load and lung injury (Liu et al. 2020b ). These observations strongly suggested that RAS activity was enhanced and AT1 receptors were overstimulated in these patients, probably as the result of direct effects of SARS-CoV-2, critical worsening of overall tissue inflammation and COVID-19 comorbidities, associated with intense mental and physical stress. Based on these findings, it has been recommended to repurpose ARBs as part of the therapeutic arsenal for COVID-19 (Liu et al. 2020b; Gurwitz 2020) . A recent article published in The Scientist and based on interviews with experts in the field summarized the rationale for the use of ARBs as COVID-19 treatment (Yeager 2020b) , and a recent article already describes in detail the beneficial effects of ARB therapy in COVID-19 patients (Liu et al. 2020a ).",

Neurological examinations are needed for all patients infected with SARS-CoA-2, whether symptomatic for COVID-19 or not, and certainly during hospitalization. COVID-19 patients should be considered a group at higher risk for brain disorders, even after recovery from the disease. Long-term neurologic follow-up after recovery from COVID-19 will reveal whether this illness is associated with neurodegenerative conditions susceptible of early treatment. Mental health support should be offered to COVID-19 patients and their families after recovery from the critical stage of their illness. 2. It has been conclusively demonstrated that treatment with ARBs protects patients and ameliorates the consequences of cerebral, cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal disorders that later become frequent COVID-19 comorbidities. ARBs have been shown to protect lung function, reduce the severity of pneumonia, and alleviate chronic pulmonary disease. These findings strongly support not to discontinue ARB treatment when medically prescribed. Abrupt ARB withdrawal in these patients will expose them to a significant risk of serious complications. 3. To definitely answer the recommendations to withdraw ARB treatment from patients already medicated with ARBs for cardiovascular and other disorders, we would need additional studies, many of them already under way. First, we need clear and conclusive evidence that ARB treatment does not predispose patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Are patients under ARB treatment less likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2? To answer this question, we would need population studies and data analysis to establish that the patient population treated with ARBs is not at higher, but instead at lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, are patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 more likely to be asymptomatic if they have been previously treated with ARBs?",

At present, even more pressing studies are under way to determine the effect of previous ARB treatment that has been continued during hospitalization of COVID-19 patients. The presence or absence of ARB therapy in COVID-19 patients is now carefully documented and monitored in many clinical centers, including determination of ARB protection against COVID-19-induced hypertension. We need to conclusively determine whether continuation of ARB treatment in COVID-19 non-hospitalized or hospitalized patients is beneficial, reducing progression, accelerating recovery, and decreasing mortality. Several preliminary analyses demonstrate that ARBs reduce the severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients (see details in the text) and more definitive results are likely to be published momentarily.",

While clinical studies as the ones described above are of immediate value, experimental research will be needed to clarify the effects of ARBs on SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cells and its virulence, and to establish the effects of ARBs not only on ACE2 but also on other coronavirus co-receptors and on associated signal transduction mechanisms.",
