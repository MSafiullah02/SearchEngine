To date, 23 hantaviruses, hosted by reservoir rodent species, have been recognized as distinct species by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [2]. Several of these rodent-borne hantaviruses cause acute, febrile diseases of varying clinical severity and lethality in humans, known as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome [3]. Though once believed to be restricted to rodents (order Rodentia, family Muridae and Cricetidae), the reservoir host range of hantaviruses is far more expansive, as evidenced by the detection of divergent lineages of hantaviruses in multiple species of shrews and moles (order Soricomorpha, family Soricidae and Talpidae) throughout Asia, Europe, Africa and North America [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19].

Although serological evidence of hantavirus infection was reported in the common serotine (Eptesicus serotinus) and greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) captured in Korea [25], genetic analysis of hantavirus isolates from these bat species suggested laboratory contamination [26].",

The primary goal of this multi-national collaborative study was to extend the search for hantaviruses in bats and to obtain more of the MOYV and XSV genomes. Our data indicate that bat-borne hantaviruses and Nova virus, a hantavirus hosted by the European mole, comprise a highly divergent phylogenetic lineage, suggesting that ancestral bats and/or soricomorphs, rather than rodents, may have served as the early reservoir hosts of primordial hantaviruses.",

In addition, hantavirus RNA was not detected in any of the 79 rectal swab and fecal samples. Because LQUV was previously found in four species of horseshoe bats in China [30], we expected to find the same or a similar hantavirus in the greater horseshoe bat, captured on Jeju Island in Korea. However, this was not the case, in spite of using LQUV-specific primers. Nevertheless, we did manage to obtain more of the MOYV and XSV genomes. That is, the original report of MOYV in the banana pipistrelle (Figure 2A,B) was based on a 423-nucleotide region of the L segment [27]. Through repeated trial-and-error efforts, suitable primers were designed to obtain an additional 1268 nucleotides of the L segment (Table 2). ",

In analyzing archival kidney tissues from 44 Pomona roundleaf bats trapped in Tuy\u00ean Quang and Quang Nam provinces, hantavirus L-segment sequences were detected in five animals (Figure 2C,D). Although a 15.7%\u201319.2% difference was found at the nucleotide level with prototype XSV, the high amino acid sequence similarity was consistent with these sequences representing genetic variants of XSV. Pair-wise alignment and comparison of the full-length S segment of XSV, amplified and sequenced from four bats (Table 2), indicated sequence similarity of 58.9%\u201360.3% at the amino acid level with LQUV, the only other bat-borne hantavirus for which the entire S segment has been sequenced. And sequence analysis of a 663-nucleotide (221 amino acid) region of the Gc envelope glycoprotein-encoding M segment showed that XSV differed by >45% from representative hantaviruses harbored by rodents and most soricomorphs. Collectively, the high level of sequence divergence in the N protein and Gc glycoprotein between XSV and other hantaviruses suggests that it might represent a new hantavirus species, using the guidelines proposed by Maes and co-workers [31]. However, the definitive taxonomic classification of XSV and other bat-borne hantaviruses must await their isolation in cell culture.",

However, the central \u03b2-pleated sheet motif of XSV, including the RNA-binding region (amino acid positions 175 to 217), was unlike that of other hantaviruses, even that of LQUV, which more closely resembled murid rodent-borne hantaviruses, such as Hantaan virus (HTNV 76-118), Dobrava virus (DOBV Greece) and Seoul virus (SEOV 80-39) (Figure 2E). The distinctive \u03b1-helix motif between two \u03b2-strands of the RNA-binding region, observed in the prototype mole-borne hantavirus, Nova virus (NVAV MSB95703), as well as HTNV and SEOV, but not in LQUV, may have a significant effect on binding specificity.",

The basal position of chiropteran-borne hantaviruses and selected soricomorph-borne hantaviruses, such as Nova virus in the European mole, Thottapalayam virus in the Asian house shrew and Imjin virus in the Ussuri white-toothed shrew, in phylogenetic trees based on the S- and L-genomic sequences suggests that soricomorphs and/or chiropterans, rather than rodents, may have been the primordial mammalian hosts of ancestral hantaviruses (Figure 3). Geographic-specific clustering was evidenced by the close phylogenetic relationship between prototype XSV VN1982 from Phu Tho province and XSV F42640 and XSV F42682 from neighboring Tuy\u00ean Quang province in northern Vietnam. On the other hand, XSV F44583, XSV 44601 and XSV 44580 from Quang Nam province in central Vietnam clustered together.

The modest proportion of hantavirus RNA detection in bat tissues may be attributed to the highly divergent nature of their genomes, as well as the very focal or localized nature of hantavirus infection, small sample sizes of bat species, primer mismatches, suboptimal PCR cycling conditions, and variable tissue preservation with degraded RNA [27,29]. Alternatively, bats may be less susceptible to hantavirus infection or may have developed immune mechanisms to curtail viral replication and/or persistence. For answers to such questions, and myriad others, reagents need to be developed and multidisciplinary collaborative studies must be designed to collect optimal specimens to isolate and characterize these newfound bat-borne hantaviruses. Only then will a better understanding be gained about their evolutionary origins and phylogeography, co-evolution history, transmission dynamics and pathogenic potential.",

Of the 533 samples tested, the majority consisted of lung (310) and kidney (51) tissues (Table 1). RNA extracted from rectal swabs and feces (79) were also tested. Bats were from seven families (Hipposideridae, Molossidae, Nycteridae, Pteropodidae, Phyllostomidae, Rhinolophidae and Vespertilionidae), 28 genera and 53 species (Figure 1). The University of Hawaii Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved the use of archival tissues as being exempt from protocol review.",

            "text": "Mammalian reservoirs of zoonotic viruses typically do not display host restrictions within a given taxonomic order. Also, infection is usually chronic, persistent and subclinical. For example, rodents of multiple genera and species, belonging to four subfamilies in the order Rodentia, serve as reservoirs of hantaviruses in Eurasia, Africa and the Americas and do not exhibit clinical disease or survival disadvantage. In addition, recently, hantaviruses exhibiting far greater genetic diversity have been detected in healthy-appearing shrews and moles representing many genera in six subfamilies within the order Soricomorpha in Eurasia, Africa and North America. Similarly, as mentioned earlier, bat species belonging to both suborders of Chiroptera host hantaviruses without evidence of apparent disease. However, some might contend that the low prevalence of hantavirus RNA in a few bat species, and the absence of hantavirus infection in the majority of bat species analyzed to date, would argue against a long-standing hantavirus-reservoir host relationship, and instead support spillover or host switching. That is, the gleaning feeding behavior of some bats, such as Nycteris, presents the possibility of acquired infection from excreta of well-established terrestrial reservoirs of hantaviruses. However, this seems highly improbable because bat-borne hantaviruses are among the most genetically diverse described to date. ",

Newfound knowledge that insectivorous bats harbor a distinctly divergent lineage of hantaviruses emphasizes the truly complex evolutionary origins and phylogeography of a group of viruses once thought to be restricted to rodents. At this point, it would not be surprising if hantaviruses are found in small mammals belonging to other taxonomic orders, such as Erinaceomorpha (hedgehogs) and even Afrosoricida (tenrecs). Such anticipated discoveries may provide additional insights into the dynamics of hantavirus transmission, potential reassortment of genomes, and molecular determinants of hantavirus pathogenicity. As importantly, a sizable expansion of the hantavirus sequence database would provide valuable tools for refining diagnostic tests and enhancing preparedness for future outbreaks caused by emerging hantaviruses.",
