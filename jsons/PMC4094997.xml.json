The capabilities of data processing and computational algorithms have dramatically increased in parallel with the number of genomes available for analysis. By leveraging the power of these data resources and algorithms, vaccine researchers are better positioned to design the next generation of vaccines, to study the fundamental immune responses that are relevant to vaccines, and to innovate in the field of vaccinology.",

The goal of the ISV Pre-conference Computational Vaccinology (ICoVax) workshops is to create an annual international forum for researchers to report, summarize, and discuss the most recent developments and ideas in the emerging areas of computational vaccinology and vaccine informatics. The most recent workshop took place immediately before the seventh Vaccine & ISV Annual Global Congress in Sitges, Spain on October 26, 2013. The first two ICoVax workshops took place in Seattle, USA and Shanghai, China in 2011 and 2012, respectively [1]. In total, three full-length papers, eight abstracts, and one software demonstration were presented at the meeting.. The three full-length papers were selected for extension and accepted for publication in a supplement in the journal BMC Bioinformatics.",

This method looks for sequence homology for only T Cell Receptor (TCR) facing ligands of the T-cell epitope that faces the TCR and generates the \"Janus Immunogenicity Score\" (JIS) based on how much cross-conservation and epitope has with the human genome and human microbiome [5]. The paper shows that putative T effector epitopes tend to have lower cross-conservation with self-epitopes, giving them high Janus Immunogenicity Scores. In contrast T regulatory epitopes had very high cross-reactivity with self and thus very low Janus Immunogenicity Scores. Furthermore, a pattern was observed in which viruses causing chronic infection (Epstein-Barr, HCV) had sequences skewed towards lower Janus Immunogenicity scores while viruses causing acute infection (Marburgh, SARS) had sequences skewed towards higher Janus Immunogenicity Scores. This tool is very promising for future research into the connection between virus immunogenicity, similarity with self and behavior and has already been incorporated into the vaccine design platform, iVAX.",

DNAVaxDB also includes the information of over 140 DNA vaccine plasmids and over 370 protective antigens used in DNA vaccine development. An analysis of these data resulted in the findings of specific patterns in areas such as subcellular localization of protective antigens and prime-boosting vaccination regimen.

The method analyzes western and Chinese herbal treatments for cardiovascular diseases, assessing the biochemical properties, regulated pathways and disease network. The findings show that Chinese herbal medicines tend to affect multiple signaling pathways and target the immune system, signal transduction and apoptosis associated pathways where as western drugs affected only a select few pathways and targeted upstream proteins regulating vascular smooth muscle contraction. The study also finds that the biochemical characteristics of Chinese herbal medicines may make them valuable sources for multi-target drug compounds or vaccine adjuvants.",

The abstract \"iVAX web-based vaccine design\" [6] presented an integrated kit of web-based informatics tools that could be used to design epitope-driven vaccines in silico, directly from the pathogen genome sequence. \"FastVax: Accelerated Vaccine Design, Production and Delivery for Emerging Infectious Diseases and Biodefense\" [7] and \"Broadly Reactive Influenza H1N1 CD4+ T-cell Epitopes Identified by Immunoinformatic Methods\" [8] demonstrated how this platform could be used to quickly identify T-cell epitopes from pathogen genomes and develop highly-immunogenic, peptide-based vaccines in a short time frame, as is necessary in pandemic outbreaks. The FastVax program has been described in previously published articles [9]. The poster presentation \"Low immunogenicity predicted for hemagglutinin of emerging avian-origin H7N9 influenza\" [10] was followed up by an oral presentation at ISV (by author and ICoVax organizer, Annie De Groot). The presentation demonstrated how vaccine design tools could be used to analyze an emerging infectious disease pathogen's genome and predict the potential efficacy of the corresponding vaccine. The poster \"Identification of T-cell Epitopes in the Hepatitis C Virus Genotype 4 Proteome: A Step towards Epitope-Driven Vaccine Development\" [11] used the iVAX platform to identify HLA I and II T-cell epitopes that could confer protective immunity against HCV genotype 4, the most prevalent genotype in the Middle East and Central Africa, which has been largely ignored by past HCV vaccine development efforts.",
