Looking back at the early response, a rapid containment strategy is crucial to control or reduce the pandemic risk, with movement restriction, antiviral prophylaxis, and public health interventions to reduce social contact. Detection, investigation, and reporting of the first cases, with appropriate contact tracing, must happen quickly. The first weeks of an outbreak are critical for developing a thorough understanding of transmission dynamics and severity of the disease. Decisions at this stage need to be made quickly, but unfortunately, decision are made under a considerable degree of scientific uncertainty.",

However, not enough of the vaccine was produced to meet the demand; it arrived at a high price (2-3-fold the price of the seasonal vaccine), and countries negotiated individually in a closed format. Equitable access to vaccines was not achievable; Mexico received its first vaccine shipment late in December 2009, several months after Canada and the United States had started their vaccination programs. The lesson here is at global level; countries need to work in a new framework to improve equitable access to influenza vaccines in pandemic situations. The efforts to establish national self-sufficiency for influenza vaccine were not ready at the time of the outbreak.
