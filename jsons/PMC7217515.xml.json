Theoretical studies for epidemiological models demonstrated that infectious diseases could spread very easily in highly heterogeneous networks [2,3]. Specifically, two fundamental epidemic models, namely the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model [4] and the susceptible-infected-susceptible model [5], exhibit outbreaks of finite relative sizes with an infinitesimal infection rate if the underlying network is fat-tailed scale-free such that the degree distribution obeys pk\u221dk\u2212\u03b3, with \u03b3\u22643\n[6,7].",

Dybiec et al.\n[13,14] considered a spatial epidemic model in a situation in which individuals can be infectious prior to exhibiting symptoms (and therefore prior to detection), and a local control measure is probabilistically applied in a neighborhood centered around a detected infectious individual. The results indicated the optimal radius necessary for the aforementioned type of a control neighborhood to contain epidemics in terms of economic costs associated with disease and treatment. Takeuchi and Yamamoto [15] studied a ring vaccination in which susceptible individuals who came in contact with infected ones were probabilistically vaccinated. The findings revealed that the ring vaccination scheme reduced the infection rate and the number of vaccinated nodes becomes considerably small when compared to those in the preventive strategies. However, the basic reproduction number (and thus the epidemic threshold) remained equal to those of random preventive vaccination, and this failed to contain epidemics in a highly heterogeneous network unless almost all individuals were vaccinated. There are also studies investigating dynamic reactions of individuals to the spread of epidemics [20\u201325], such as behavioral responses of individuals by reducing their contact rates [25], based on the number of infected neighbors or by rewiring connections (i.e., disconnecting their connections to infected neighbors and reconnecting others) [21].",

The efficiency of the prompt quarantine measure is numerically and analytically investigated to suppress SIR epidemics in typical networks in terms of the mean outbreak size, the epidemic threshold, and the occurrence probability of global outbreaks. The prompt quarantine measure is highly effective in containing epidemics, and it can theoretically eradicate epidemics in highly heterogeneous networks even when infected individuals are detected with a very small probability. The numerical simulations also indicate that the quarantine measure is effective in real networks.",

The efficiency of the proposed measure in suppressing the SIR model in the RGs and the uncorrelated SFNs was numerically tested. Monte Carlo simulations indicated that the quarantine measure outperformed the random and acquaintance vaccination schemes with respect to the reduction of the number of R nodes. The generating function formalism for uncorrelated networks was used to obtain the occurrence probability of global outbreaks and the epidemic threshold Tc. The equation that derives Tc was expanded to show that the epidemic threshold increases to a positive value even in fat-tailed SFNs given a nonzero detection probability.

Peak et al.\n[29] investigated the relationship between the effectiveness of quarantine and symptom monitoring, taking into account delay, in containing epidemics and disease dynamics parametrized by seven case-study diseases.

Pereira and Young [30] studied the effectiveness of delayed isolations for infected nodes (not including their neighbors) in controlling susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemics to show that the disease is (not) effectively controlled if the delay in isolating infected nodes is shorter (longer) than a certain critical value. Very recently, Strona and Castellano [31] considered the SIR model with a quarantine measure, having a delay in the early stage of epidemics, and found the rapid decay in its efficiency; if the implementation is not prompt enough, then the quarantines become highly inefficient. For our case, the effectiveness of quarantines is expected to be weakened when a delay among infection, detection, and quarantine is incorporated. For example, the model can be extended to have a delay time tdelay for the execution of a quarantine after a node becomes \u201cdetected.\u201d In the simplest setting, an infected node i with degree ki can try to infect further kadd=min(tdelay,ki\u2212kD) neighbors after its kDth neighbor becomes detected. Monte Carlo simulations for such cases show that the performance of quarantine strategy actually becomes worse with increasing delay time tdelay (not shown). The epidemic threshold also decreases as tdelay increases and reaches the threshold for the random vaccination with the same value of f when tdelay becomes larger than the largest degree kmax\n[32].",
