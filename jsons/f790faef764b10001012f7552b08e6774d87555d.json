Colds are associated with different symptoms such as cough, runny nose, blocked nose, sore throat, and are sometimes accompanied by muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite [10] . Often one symptom is more dominant or more bothersome to the patient than other symptoms and the symptoms usually change over the course of the infection. The symptoms start typically with sore throat (angina) (50 % of patients [11] ) and fatigue, progress to rhinitis with sneezing, runny nose or blocked nose and then cough (40 % of patients [11] ). Similarly, but not identically, other authors report that usually, common cold starts with sore throat (acute pharyngitis) followed by rhinitis, rhinosinusitis and in some but not all cases acute otitis media (in children) or bronchitis with the main symptom dry cough [12] . It is therefore author's current position that the term common cold should be understood as an umbrella term: the first infection site usually being the pharynx, followed by coryza (rhinitis), sinusitis etc.",

Usually they do not allow conclusions about a specific viral pathogen. Sometimes a patient's medical and travel history alongside with the local endemic situation can suggest a certain viral pathogen. Identification of the pathogen is most important for public health services assessing the epidemiological situation; the particular pathogen needs to be confirmed by microbiological and/or serology studies. Identifica-tion of the pathogen should allow assessment of latency, contagiousness and public health threats. E.g. it is generally thought that rhinovirus colds are most infectious during the first 3 days and much less so after that.",

The mechanism of action of virus-induced inflammation in asthma exacerbations is not fully understood, but atopic asthmatics may release less antiviral interferon-alpha if their peripheral blood mononuclear cells are cross-linked with specific IgE [18] . Rhinovirus induced steroid resistance might also play an important role [19] .

The main symptom is cough. Acute bronchitis is arbitrarily defined as usually lasting three weeks. However, in some patients with heightened cough reflex sensitivity cough can be more intense and can last longer [23] . Cough in acute bronchitis is due to irritation of receptors by release of inflammatory mediators disrupting the intact respiratory epithelium thereby sensitizing superficial cough receptors and the afferent pathway of the cough reflex. In contrast, excessive secretions play a rather ancillary role, emerging only at the very beginning of the illness [24] . Over recent years, 5 major pulmonary societies have published guidelines on the diagnosis and management of cough, including cough in acute bronchitis [25 -32] . Wenzel et al. define acute bronchitis as a clinical term implying a self-limited inflammation of the large airways of the lung that is characterized by cough without pneumonia [33] . Due to the overlap of symptoms, the empirical diagnosis of pneumonia, acute bronchitis and upper respiratory tract infections in an outpatient setting remains difficult [34] . It is also evident that acute bronchitis symptoms usually occur after an upper respiratory tract infection [35] . Only 50 % of patients with acute bronchitis produce purulent sputum that represents detritus containing tracheobronchial epithelial and inflammatory cells [36] as well as mucus. As the cough is often not 'wet' but 'dry', mucolytic agents are not always helpful. During a normal cold it is not uncommon for the cough to start with a short dry phase, for it to become wet within the following 48 hours, then reverting back to a dry cough. Cough is also one of 5 typical symptoms of acute bronchitis assessed by the Bronchitis Severity Scale (BSS; comprising cough, sputum, rales on auscultation, chest pain on coughing and dyspnea), which is currently the only validated scale to measure the severity of acute bronchitis in the general population [37] . Because of the overlap of symptoms in acute bronchitis and common cold, this scale was also recommended as a reliable tool to assess therapeutic effects in the latter condition [38] .",

Examining the symptoms reported by the patients with acute bronchitis and common cold, respectively, revealed that the symptoms cough, runny nose, fever, sore throat, nausea, sleep disturbance, and sweats were present in differing proportions but in both groups of patients. Cough was present in the majority of both conditions but did occur somewhat more often in patients diagnosed with acute bronchitis. Furthermore, comparisons of the recorded physical findings showed the presence of erythematous throat, erythema of tympanic membrane, paranasal sinus tenderness and chest rales in both conditions. The authors concluded that there was considerable overlap between the two conditions, and cough only explained 37 % of the variation between the diagnoses in the logistic model [7] .",

A randomized study with healthy volunteers who had undergone capsaicin challenge reaching only the nerve endings in the nasal mucosa found that subsequent inhalation of a tussigenic aerosol enhanced cough intensity after nasal capsaicin challenge if compared with the control condition [44] . In a similar study of cough sensitivity in children either with allergic rhinitis (both in and out of pollen season) or children with URI the same enhancement of cough sensitivity was found if compared with controls. The authors concluded that pathological processes of the nasal mucosa of any etiology could cause a sensitization of the cough reflex [45] by trigeminus mediated central mechanisms. As was shown by Tatar and colleagues [23] as well as Buday et al. [46] , cough sensitivity can be enhanced via nasal mucosa, irrespective the fact, that the nasal mucosa doesn't have vagal afferent cough reflex innervation. There-fore, although not every patient suffering from rhinosinusitis is coughing, in patients having a heightened cough reflex sensitivity cough can be elicited by rhinosinusitis (see below).",

Common symptoms of both the common cold and ARS are nasal blockage/obstruction/congestion or nasal discharge, rhinorrhea, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and inflamed nasal mucosa. The sudden onset of 2 or more symptoms one of which is nasal blockage/obstruction/congestion or nasal discharge (anterior/posterior nasal drip) and either facial pain or pressure or reduction or loss of smell for less than 12 weeks usually leads to the diagnosis ARS [47] . Only a small percentage of post-viral rhinosinusitis is caused by bacteria [47] . In the EPOS Guidelines [47] and in several presentations during the American Cough Conference 2015 in Washington, DC (will be published in Lung), however, it was suggested that a prolonged duration of ARS of up to 12 weeks is not, in itself, a sign that the condition is of bacterial origin. In addition, results of a study addressing the question of possible bidirectional modulation of cough response in human healthy volunteers showed that, in addition to trigeminal afferents expressing TRP channels, olfactory nerve endings, trigemino-olfactoric relationships, the smell perception process and other supramedullar influences should be considered as potential modulators of the cough response in humans [46] .",

Furthermore, cough, runny nose, chills, nasal congestions, and hoarseness are further symptoms which are common in non-bacterial pharyngitis and common cold [49] . The symptom sore throat is most likely caused by the action of prostaglandins and bradykinin on sensory nerve endings in the airway and the sensation of pain is mediated by the cranial nerves supplying the nasopharynx and pharynx [13] . Likewise, acute laryngitis is considered to be an infection of the larynx that results in an inflammatory reaction and consequential symptoms and signs [50] .

[7] hypothesized that sinusitis, viral upper respiratory tract infections/ common cold, and acute bronchitis are all variations of the same clinical entity and that a reconceptualization of acute viral respiratory infection as a single problem, rather than anatomically distinct disorders, is warranted. Therefore, effective and fast relief of the many different symptoms of common cold requires treatments with broad efficacy on different symptoms i. e. anti-inflammatory, antitussive, secretolytic, antiviral efficacy. Alternatively, sequential treatment of successively developing symptoms, i. e. first mucolytic, decongestant and anti-inflammatory, while later in the dry cough phase of the disease antitussive is necessary.",

Die Differenzialdiagnose ist dennoch umstritten. Die vorliegende Arbeit diskutiert, in welchem Ausma\u00df akute Atemwegsinfektionen jeweils anatomisch genau lokalisiert werden k\u00f6nnen (z. B. Pharyngitis, Rhinitis etc.) oder ob eine solche Unterscheidung angesichts \u00fcberlappender und ineinander \u00fcbergehender Symptome ohne Bedeutung ist. Akute Atemwegsinfektionen treten mit \u00f6rtlich und zeitlich wechselnden Symptomen auf. Die diagnostische Einordnung (z. B. Laryngitis oder Bronchitis) basiert auf einer vermuteten anatomischen Lokalisierung der dominierenden Beschwerden. Es zeigt sich allerdings, dass sich die verschiedenen Symptome stark \u00fcberlappen bzw. in zeitlicher Abfolge auftreten. Eine symptombasierte diagnostische Unterscheidung bei akuten Atemwegsinfektionen in Abh\u00e4ngigkeit von der jeweiligen anatomischen Lokalisation erscheint somit schwierig. Die symptomatische Behandlung sollte daher auf die Verbesserung aller in Frage kommenden Symptome und nicht auf die Behandlung eines einzelnen Symptoms, wie beispielsweise auf die vermehrte Schleimproduktion bei akuter Bronchitis, gerichtet sein.",
