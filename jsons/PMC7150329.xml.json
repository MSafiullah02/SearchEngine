The AIDS pandemic is best described as the sum of discontinuous and overlapping epidemics of disease among populations of variable and varying risk (see Chapter 81). The predominant modes of transmission of HIV (perinatal, sexual, and parenteral) result in a bimodal distribution of disease, with peaks among young children and young adults. The risk of infection or disease due to tropical pathogens varies widely with differences in ecological, political, and socioeconomic conditions (including access to medical care); related specific host factors such as age of exposure, pregnancy, behavior, and nutrition; and host genetics. Disease due to a coinfecting pathogen may be due to primary infection, recurrent infection, or the reactivation of latent infection. For some pathogens, the risk factor responsible for the acquisition of HIV may also be the risk factor responsible for the acquisition of the coinfecting pathogen. As a consequence of this epidemiologic complexity, both the prevalence and the expression of coinfection are variable across ecological, economic, political, behavioral, and cultural divides.",

The ability to diagnose and monitor coinfection may be compromised by aberrant serologic responses, including false positives due to polyclonal B-cell activation, false negatives due to blunted antigen-specific antibody responses to newly acquired pathogens, and false serologic reversion after treatment in late HIV disease.4 Diagnosis may also be hindered by unusual presentations of disease with coinfecting pathogens. Finally, a plethora of intercurrent pathologic conditions may lead to a dulling of Ockham's razor during disease evaluation in AIDS patients. A single pathogen, multiple pathogens, HIV infection, side effects of therapeutic drugs, or a combination of these may be responsible for the presenting complaints. Given the suboptimal response to the chemotherapy of many infections in the presence of profound immunosuppression, drugs may need to be given in greater numbers or for a longer duration. With many pathogens, in the absence of immune reconstitution resulting from highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), lifelong suppressive therapy is necessary. Drug therapy in the HIV-infected patient may be complicated further by increased rates of drug allergy as well as by untoward drug interactions in the setting of polypharmacy.19 Prophylaxis against coinfections may be compromised by substandard vaccination responses. Finally, the presence of HIV coinfection can complicate the public health consequences of tropical diseases. AIDS may increase the transmissibility of secondary infections and provide fertile soil for the development of drug resistance. Public health resources devoted to the AIDS pandemic may divert resources away from the control and prevention of other infectious diseases.",

Coinfection has also been demonstrated to have subtle effects on the course of disease with other tropical agents, such as Schistosoma mansoni. No robust alteration has been found in the natural history of many tropical infections, including most nematodes. With organisms in the latter groups, the current absence of evidence of significant effects of HIV on the expression of disease or the response to treatment should not be construed as strong evidence for the absence of such effects. Most research resources have been spent on understanding the clinical and epidemiologic manifestations of the HIV pandemic in industrialized countries, where tropical infectious diseases are underrepresented. Where coinfections with HIV and endemic tropical diseases are marked by low prevalence, subtlety of interaction, diagnostic difficulty, or low research priority, the presence and significance of any interaction are likely to be missed. For example, despite the research priority among tropical infections accorded to malaria, the first significant interaction appreciated with HIV infection \u2013 the lack of a benefit of increasing parity in the control of malaria in pregnant women \u2013 was only discovered 15 years after the AIDS epidemic was recognized.20 With less heavily studied pathogens, comparatively subtle interactions will likely emerge over time as research resources are appropriately directed.",

In the presence of inadequate infrastructures, limited financial resources, and difficult access to medical care on the part of the socially disadvantaged, surveillance is likely to be sporadic and to involve mainly the sampling of subgroups of AIDS patients at late stages of disease.20 Where resources are limited, diagnostic reporting is likely to be biased in favor of OIs that are inexpensive to diagnose (or misdiagnose).20 Even the common impression that the progression of AIDS is more rapid in sub-Saharan Africa than in industrialized countries22, 23, 24, 25 rests on data that are less than robust.26 A more rapid observed course (presumed due to a higher frequency and virulence of coinfection and problems of nutrition and access to medical care) may represent in large part a systematic bias in favor of later initial diagnosis of HIV infection and AIDS.20, 27 Conversely, it has been suggested that the burden of illness and mortality in early HIV disease (often unrecognized as such) due to high-grade pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and the salmonellae, may rival that due to the OIs of late-stage AIDS in the tropics.27, 28\n",

The central role of ongoing viral replication in HIV pathogenesis is firmly established, and the set point concentration of plasma viremia correlates well with long-term clinical outcome.29 It is presumed that any increases in viral replication have the potential for accelerating the course of disease. Efficient replication of HIV in CD4+ T cells is dependent on cellular activation. Similarly, activation of macrophages and dendritic cells can stimulate HIV replication by increasing transcription factor binding to the HIV long terminal repeat region, enhancing transcription. Coinfecting pathogens can stimulate such immune cell activation either directly (e.g., stimulating signaling through Toll-like receptors30 or upregulating transcription factor transactivation in coinfected immune cells) or indirectly (e.g., promoting the generation of proinflammatory cytokines or activating CD4+ T cells as part of the adaptive immune response). Immune activation can also lead to upregulation of the expression of HIV coreceptors,31 thereby facilitating the infection of fresh cells.",

            "text": "Direct equation of immune activation with upregulation of HIV replication is simplistic, however. With CD4+ T cells, the mechanism of activation appears to be critical to whether viral replication is induced or suppressed.47, 48, 49 Furthermore, activation of proinflammatory cytokine production with positive effects on HIV replication goes hand in hand with activation of anti-inflammatory cytokine production, which can inhibit HIV replication. More generally, immune responses reliably induce counterregulatory responses that may well suppress HIV replication.50, 51 It thus should not be surprising that in vitro studies have provided mechanistic support for the ability of coinfecting pathogens to suppress HIV replication.52, 53, 54, 55 Indeed, whereas infection with some tropical pathogens (e.g., Plasmodium falciparum) has been shown to increase plasma HIV load, the overall effect of acute coinfection with some pathogens, including measles virus, dengue virus, and Orientia tsutsugamushi, may be a decrease in HIV viral load.56, 57, 58 That said, measures of persistent immune activation, broadly taken, have been shown to correlate, independently of plasma viral load, with a steeper slope of CD4+ T-cell depletion, disease progression, and mortality risk.59, 60 While the responsible mechanisms remain underdefined, coinfection may thus favor the progression HIV disease independently of effects on viral dynamics. In this context, the provocative finding that HIV infection leads to sustained systemic exposure to microbial products from the gut61 (something that may well be abetted by tropical gut luminal and tissue pathogens) is potentially of special importance.",

Cross-regulating subsets of CD4+ T cells have been distinguished by their cytokine profiles and functional activities: Th1 cells (producing IFN-\u03b3, among other cytokines) are important in classical macrophage activation, the development of CMI, and the generation of humoral responses involving complement-fixing antibody isotypes; Th2 cells (producing IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, among other cytokines) are important in alternative macrophage activation, the generation of immunoglobulin E (IgE) responses, eosinophilia, mast cell responses, and atopy. The immunologic response to most helminthic parasites is dominated by Th2 cytokine production. Mouse models have shown that helminth-driven Th2 polarization can shift the immunologic response to heterologous antigens and pathogens from a Th1- to a Th2-dominant pattern, as well as significantly suppress CD8+ T-cell-mediated viral clearance.62, 63 Such responses have also been found to impair antigen-specific Th1 immune responses in both mice and humans.62, 64\n",

The resultant Th2 \u201cpriming\u201d of the immune system may favor progression of HIV disease.65 Several mechanisms have been postulated. First, a Th2-polarized immune system may directly suppress CD8+ T-cell-mediated anti-HIV responses.63 Second, HIV appears to replicate preferentially in Th2 cells,66 something that may well be due to increased expression of APOBEC3G, a cytidine deaminase with anti-HIV activity, in Th1 cells.40, 41 Third, T cells from HIV-seropositive people undergo abnormal activation-induced apoptosis,7, 8 which is thought to play a role in the depletion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells over time.41 Th2 cytokines can amplify such activation-induced apoptosis.67 Fourth, Th2 cytokines can upregulate HIV coreceptor expression by CD4+ T cells and monocyte/macrophages.68 Of note, it has been demonstrated that peripheral blood cells from patients with intestinal helminth infection are more susceptible to in vitro infection with HIV than are cells from helminth-uninfected patients.69, 70 Fifth, diverse chronic helminth infections are associated with the development of strong immune counterregulatory responses, which may blunt heterologous anti-HIV immune responses.43 Finally, both tissue trematodes (e.g., schistosomes) and luminal nematodes (e.g., geohelminths) are likely to have effects on gut mucosal permeability, something that may drive immune activation and disease progression by increasing systemic exposure to gut-derived microbial products.",

The hypothesis has been difficult to clearly address experimentally. An initial study in Ethiopia indicated that HIV viral load was significantly higher in individuals with various helminthic infections than in individuals without helminths, correlating positively with the parasite load as well as decreasing after elimination of the worms by antiparasitic treatment.71 Subsequently, several similar studies from southern Africa failed to replicate these findings,72, 73 one study even reporting significant, transient increases in viral load after therapy for schistosomiasis.45 A Cochrane Review49 analyzed the only three randomized, controlled trials published to date on the effects of anthelminthic therapy on HIV disease progression in antiretroviral na\u00efve patients: (1) a randomized trial of praziquantel for schistosomiasis, which found a significant benefit of treatment on plasma HIV-1 RNA load (a lack of an increase with treatment, compared with an increase in viral load in the absence of treatment), with a nonsignificant trend towards a beneficial effect on CD4+ counts in HIV-infected individuals;50 (2) a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial of diethylcarbamazine for bancroftian filariasis, which reported a decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA load (and a nonsignificant trend towards a beneficial effect on CD4+ counts) with treatment;51 and (3) a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of albendazole for infection with diverse geohelminths (including hookworms, Ascaris, and Trichuris), which found a nonsignificant trend towards a beneficial effect of treatment on plasma HIV-1 RNA load, but a significant benefit of treatment on CD4+ T-cell counts, specifically in the subset of patients with Ascaris infection.52 Pooling of data from these three trials \u2013 a procedure that seems biologically tenuous \u2013 suggested significant (at least short-term) benefit of deworming on plasma HIV-1 mRNA load and CD4+ T-cell counts.49 The overall hypothesis thus remains compelling. However, given the short-term follow-up, the variable biology and epidemiology of these different organisms, and the different interventions used in these trials, the clearest conclusions to be made are that more data on the subject are needed \u2013 something underscored by a recent alarming report that maternal helminth coinfection is associated with a significantly increased risk for mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection.53\n",

Severe disease and death due to P. falciparum occur in those lacking specific acquired immunity, something that only develops in the face of high rates of transmission and over time. With stable, heavy transmission, the greatest burden of disease occurs in young children, travelers, and pregnant women (the latter, for reasons discussed below); nonpregnant adults tend to be parasitemic in the absence of symptoms. With unstable or low transmission rates, the relationship between parasitemia and disease tends to be more direct, and the burden of disease falls more equally.85 As might be expected, interactions between P. falciparum and HIV vary with malaria transmission dynamics.86\n",

Despite age-dependent induction of immunity to severe disease in such areas, pregnant women have heightened vulnerablility to both asymptomatic and symptomatic parasitemia;87 the placental vasculature shields parasitized erythrocytes from the systemic immune response, allowing localized parasite replication. Placental parasitemia has been associated with low birth weight and increased infant mortality. Uteroplacental immune responses do restrict parasite replication, however, and the effectiveness of these responses increases in subsequent pregnancies under pressure of recurrent malarial exposure. Parity-acquired immunity to P. falciparum is delayed or impaired in the presence of HIV infection.88, 89 In turn, the beneficial effects (maternal, placental, and neonatal) of parity in the control of parasitemia during pregnancy are markedly attenuated in the face of HIV coinfection.90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 HIV infection is associated with increased rates and levels of peripheral and placental parasitemia, clinical malaria, and maternal anemia in pregnant women; and coinfection is associated with a higher risk of low birth weight, preterm birth, intrauterine growth retardation, and postnatal infant mortality. Although placental parasitemia is associated with increased placental HIV viral loads in coinfected patients,90 it remains unclear as to whether this increases the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Conflicting results (enhancement, protection, and no effect) have all been published.96, 97, 100 A World Health Organization (WHO) technical consultation has recommended that HIV-infected pregnant women at risk for malaria should use insecticide-treated bednets, along with (according to HIV stage) either intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (at higher doses than is recommended for nonpregnant populations) or daily trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis.101, 102\n",

Principal effects are on the CYP3A4 isoform (with ritonavir being the most potent inhibitor), although the CYP2D6 isoform may also be affected.122, 123 Nevirapine and efavirenz cause secondary induction of CYP3A4, an effect of ritonavir and nelfinavir as well.122 Most antimalarial agents are largely metabolized via P450 enzymes. Mefloquine appears to be no exception, although details remain poorly understood.124 Proguanil and chloroquine metabolism appears to be largely by the CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 isoforms, respectively.125, 126, 127, 128 Chloroquine also undergoes appreciable renal excretion, whereas doxycycline largely avoids these pathways. However, it should be noted that these interactions are in vitro observations, and it is unknown whether these theoretical considerations have practical consequences in vivo. Published pharmacokinetic data suggest that: (1) there are no significant drug\u2013drug interactions between nelfinavir or indinavir and mefloquine;129 (2) ritonavir has minimal effects on mefloquine pharmacokinetics, whereas mefloquine suppresses ritonavir plasma levels;130 and (3) atovaquone increases serum zidovudine (AZT) levels by approximately 30%, although AZT has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of atovaquone.131 In summary, the actual pharmacokinetics are not easily predictable from theoretical considerations, and there is a paucity of data. Based on the current data, mefloquine, doxycycline, chloroquine, and malarone (atovaquone + proguanil) are likely to be safe and to retain efficacy for prophylaxis of sensitive strains of malaria.",

There are no actual clinical data, however. Whether there are clinically relevant effects of these PIs on the metabolism of artemisinin compounds (dependent at least in part on CYP3A4) remains unknown. Uncomplicated malaria can probably be safely treated with mefloquine (in regions of susceptible strains), or atovaquone/proguanil or artemesinins plus doxycyline. Use of quinine, quinidine, or artemisinin compounds remains essential for the parenteral therapy of severe chloroquine-resistant malaria. For those on ritonavir (and/or other PIs, delaviridine, or efavirenz), the normal loading dose of quinine or quinidine should probably be given, along with some reduction of the maintenance infusion dose. Obviously, careful monitoring needs to be done for the potentially fatal arrhythmic consequences of quinine/quinidine overdosage in this setting. Given the lack of data, however, underdosing may also be a potential problem. The \u201cwashout\u201d period for the metabolic effects of ritonavir is thought to be 24\u201348 hours.",

In vivo, the overall loss of immunological control of parasite infection is reflected by often-aberrant manifestations of VL in AIDS, including peripheral parasitemia (found in more than 50%) and parasite dissemination to unusual body compartments.148 An AIDS-related OI occurring at low CD4+ T-cell counts, leishmaniasis may be due either to primary infection or to the reactivation of clinically latent infection.149, 150 Although published data on the interaction of HIV and Leishmania focus largely on the effects of HIV on leishmanial infection and disease, there is also both in vitro and in vivo evidence that Leishmania can augment HIV replication.151, 152, 153\n",

A greater variability in zymodemes (enzyme markers) has been found in parasite isolates from HIV-infected than uninfected patients. In one series, five isolates were recovered from HIV-infected patients that had previously not been encountered in immunocompetent people with either VL or cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL).154 The finding that certain strains of Leishmania typically causing cutaneous disease are being recovered from the bone marrow of coinfected patients could support either the primary or the reactivation hypothesis.155 Normally, the age distribution of VL caused by L. donovani includes adults as well as children. In contrast, VL due to L. infantum affects children predominantly, often age 5 years or younger. In Spain, where intravenous drug use accounts for the majority of HIV\u2013Leishmania coinfections, the age distribution of VL has been reversed, with most cases occurring in young adult males.156 The fact that half of patients have demonstrable organisms in peripheral blood smears157 and the fact that sandflies can readily be infected by feeding on coinfected patients158 provide evidence for an additional anthroponotic cycle of transmission in this setting.155 In summary, although reactivation of latent leishmanial infection is difficult to exclude, increasing evidence \u2013 in southern Europe, at least \u2013 favors primary infection by certain strains of Leishmania as the main mechanism for coinfection with HIV/AIDS.",

The bulk of the information on VL complicating HIV infection involves L. infantum in the Mediterranean region. Presumably, the ability to visceralize under the influence of HIV also applies to L. donovani in southern Asia and Africa and to L. chagasi in Latin America; however, documentation for this is still somewhat meager, one of the possible reasons being the poor overlap between geographic distribution of leishmaniasis caused by these species and the distribution, as well as prevalence, of HIV infection. The species of Leishmania that cause CL have been implicated only rarely as OIs in HIV/AIDS.

In contrast, approximately 50% of coinfected patients lack detectable antibody levels.142, 149, 150, 170 The situation may be different in instances in which leishmanial infection precedes HIV infection and the impaired immune responses that ensue. Gradoni and associates180 suggested that this type of serologic data could be used as an indicator of the sequence of acquisition of the two infections. Support for this concept is provided by a report from Ethiopia of seven cases of VL with HIV coinfection, all with highly elevated antileishmanial antibody titers.181 All patients had lived for many years in a leishmaniasis-endemic area of Ethiopia.181 The recombinant antigen rK-39 appears to be highly sensitive and specific for immunodiagnosis of VL due to L. donovani and L. chagasi in patients without complicating HIV infection; however, the sensitivity of rK-39 for immunodiagnosis of cutaneous cases from Turkey was greatly reduced compared with most cases of VL.182 The utility of rK-39-based diagnostics is not clear in HIV-seropositive people. The peripheral parasitemia displayed by many HIV-coinfected individuals allows the detection of parasites from the blood in approximately 50% of cases. Cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of buffy-coat preparations are positive in 70% and up to 100%, respectively.149, 150, 183\n",

The same drugs used for treatment of VL in normal hosts (including pentavalent antimonials and amphotericin B preparations) have utility in the treatment of coinfected patients, albeit with significantly less efficacy.170 Amphotericin B is a conventional drug for all forms of leishmaniasis, including visceral disease. Liposomally encapsulated amphotericin has the theoretical advantage of being targeted to macrophages, host cells for leishmanial parasites. Between 40% and 65% of coinfected patients have initial parasitological cure after treatment with pentavalent antimonials, amphotericin B deoxycholate, or amphotericin B lipid complex.170, 186, 187 Among these options, treatment with lipid formulations of amphotericin B appears to have similar efficacy, but less severe toxicity, than the other drugs. However, the experience with lipid formulations of amphotericin B in coinfected patients is limited. These lipid formulations are also quite expensive. Miltefosine, an oral agent that is safe and effective for the treatment of Indian patients with VL,188 has shown promise in early compassionate-use treatments of VL in HIV-infected subjects.189\n",

Because the cases of HIV-related Chagas disease reported to date largely represent reactivation of chronic infection during the course of HIV-induced immunosuppression and not primary infection in the face of AIDS (not surprising given the differing patterns of epidemiological risk for these infections: largely rural for T. cruzi and largely urban for HIV), this OI can be expected to appear outside these geographic bounds. It should be noted that activation of latent T. cruzi infection, as well as exacerbated primary infection (transmitted by blood transfusion), is also well described in the face of the iatrogenic immunosuppression used for solid-organ transplantation and therapy for hematological malignancies.",

Clinically, such reactivation most commonly involves the central nervous system (CNS).199, 200\nT. cruzi was probably late in being recognized as an opportunistic pathogen in this setting because the most prominent features of disease are similar to those of toxoplasmic meningoencephalitis. Enlargement of hemorrhagic foci can produce mass effects simulating brain tumors. Lesions are often multiple, with computed tomographic (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showing ring enhancement and preferential involvement of the white matter. Toxoplasmic encephalitis may coexist in the same patient.201 The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings include a slight pleocytosis, increased protein, slightly decreased glucose in some patients, and the presence of trypanosomes. Histologically, the brain lesions show necrotic foci with hemorrhage and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Amastigote forms of the parasite are abundant in glial cells and macrophages and only occasionally in neuronal cells. Myocarditis is a common autopsy finding in those dying of AIDS-related T. cruzi meningoencephalitis.198 Such myocarditis is often clinically silent. Clinical manifestations, when present, involve arrhythmias and congestive heart failure.199, 202, 203 Diagnosis of reactivated T. cruzi infection depends, first, on considering the possibility based on the geographic origin of the patient, and on an appreciation of the clinical picture. If neurologic signs are present, performing a CT scan or MRI is key.204 The imaging pattern of CNS T. cruzi infection is indistinguishable from that of toxoplasmic encephalitis. Direct microscopic examination of centrifuged sediment of CSF will often show motile trypanosomes. If fever and other systemic signs are present, direct examination of the buffy coat from the microhematocrit tube may also show motile trypanosomes. Since serum antibodies to T. cruzi indicate previous infection with the parasite, this test is only useful for ruling out reactivated infection if it is negative. If other tests are inconclusive, biopsy of a brain lesion to demonstrate characteristic organisms can be done. PCR on blood or CSF requires research laboratory facilities.",

HIV-related reactivation is associated with high parasitemia, however, whereas the parasitemia of chronic disease is very low.205 Indeed, even in the absence of overt, clinical reactivation, chronic Chagas disease is associated with a higher percentage and level of parasitemia in those coinfected with HIV (independent of CD4 count) than in HIV seronegatives.206 The effects of coinfection appear to be bidirectional. HIV viral load has been documented to increase simultaneously with an asymptomatic increase in T. cruzi parasitemia, returning to baseline in the face of successful antiparasitic treatment.207 Nifurtimox and benznidazole, both of which have moderate antitrypanosomal activity, are the standard drugs recommended for treatment of Chagas disease. However, there is not enough experience to evaluate the effectiveness of these drugs in the treatment of T. cruzi infections complicating HIV/AIDS, especially in cases with meningoencephalitis. No information is available on the penetration of nifurtimox and benznidazole into the CNS, and the survival time of reported cases of coinfection has been short. A patient reported by Nishioka and coworkers208 survived for 92 days, with disappearance of trypanosomes from the blood and CSF as well as clearance of a brain lesion while being treated with benznidazole at a dose of 8 mg/kg/day for 80 days. Clinical improvement and reduction in size of a brain lesion were attributed to treatment with benznidazole plus, later, itraconazole and fluconazole in another patient with coinfection who survived for at least 6 months.209 Itraconazole and ketaconazole have been used and are reported to have reduced parasitemia in one case each,210 but both cases succumbed to HIV infection. Although there is no other reported experience with the use of itraconazole or fluconazole in the treatment of American trypanosomiasis in humans, itraconazole was reported to be very effective in experimental infections.211 It has been recommended that treatment of T. cruzi infection in the setting of HIV be started early in the reactivation process, when parasitemia is detectable, but before irreversible end-organ damage has occurred.207 Such a strategy would hinge on serological identification of those at risk, something indicated in all HIV-infected individuals with appreciable risk of T. cruzi infection. Although data are lacking, it should be noted that immunological reconstitution through HAART therapy is likely to provide considerable prophylactic and therapeutic benefit in this disease.",

Avoiding cat feces in and around dwellings is probably not sufficient because the oocysts are viable for up to 18 months in moist soil.

More subtle interactions have been explored in schistosomiasis (see Chapter 122). A study of car washers working on the shores of Lake Victoria in Kenya, a population with a high intensity of exposure to Schistosoma mansoni and an HIV seroprevalence of approximately 30%, has provided insights into the bidirectional effects of coinfection.305 The CD4+ T-cell-dependent granulomatous response to schistosome eggs has been shown to be important in egg migration from venules to the lumen of the intestine in mouse models of disease.306 As might thereby be expected, a significant suppression of egg excretion efficiency, controlled for the degree of infection, was found in S. mansoni-infected patients in the presence of HIV coinfection and low CD4+ T-cell counts.307 Although successful therapy of S. mansoni infection with praziquantel may depend on the host antibody response, praziquantel was efficacious in treating schistosomiasis in this HIV-infected cohort.308 Given that schistosome infection likely preceded HIV infection in these individuals, whether praziquantel will have equal efficacy in individuals infected first with HIV remains an open question. In this context, a study from Kenya reported that treatment with a standard regimen of praziquantel in coinfected individuals resulted in normal kinetics of reduction in egg excretion, but a slower decline in serum levels of an adult worm antigen \u2013 interpreted to indicate less efficient killing of adult worms.309 Notably, despite similar responses to therapy, individuals with HIV coinfection and low CD4+ T-cell counts showed increased susceptibility to reinfection after therapy,310 something that appeared to correlate with blunted immunological responses to successful drug therapy (and the resultant release of parasite antigens) in such individuals.311 A study of HIV/S. haematobium coinfection in Zambia mirrored these findings: (1) coinfected individuals had lower egg excretion; and (2) praziquantel retained efficacy in the face of coinfection.312 No alteration in resistance to reinfection with S. haematobium was seen in the face of HIV infection, but CD4+ T-cell counts were not performed in this cohort that lacked clinically evident HIV disease. It thus remains possible that, as with S. mansoni infection, resistance to reinfection with S. haematobium is decreased with progression of HIV/AIDS.",

This did not occur. The available evidence makes it extremely unlikely that misdiagnosis or underreporting are the relevant factors here; severe strongyloidiasis or hyperinfection syndrome has prominent clinical features and is often fatal if untreated, and it is not likely that the association would escape notice. Few cases of hyperinfection syndrome have been reported in the English-language literature.336, 337, 338, 339, 340, 341, 342, 343, 344, 345 Even among these cases, the presence of hyperinfection is poorly documented in many; and, all too frequently, there is confusion between severe GI disease and hyperinfection.346\n",

In normal hosts, scabies is usually manifest as a markedly pruritic, papular, and vesicular dermatitis, with pathognomonic burrows harboring gravid females. Excoriations, nodules, and eczematous or impetiginized plaques may also be found. Relatively few adult mites are normally present. Crusted scabies is seen in neurologically impaired or immunosuppressed patients. Pruritus is often absent or mild. Lesions consist of widespread hyperkeratotic, crusted, scaling, fissured plaques. The nails are frequently involved. Patients tend to be heavily infested, with thousands of adult mites (see Chapter 124). Crusted scabies has been reported as a complication of HIV infection. CD4+ T-cell counts in reported cases have been less than 500/\u00b5L.367, 368, 369 Both typical and atypical presentations are seen, the latter including the \u201cpruritus of AIDS,\u201d crusting with pruritus, pruritic papular dermatitis, and mimics of Darier's disease and psoriasis.368 Secondary sepsis and death have been reported.370 In the face of this clinical variability, the diagnosis of crusted scabies in HIV-seropositive people rests on appropriate clinical suspicion and the demonstration of heavy infestation by microscopic examination of skin scrapings. With such extraordinary mite loads, these patients are remarkably contagious.371, 372 Combination therapy with ivermectin 200 \u00b5g/kg and topical benzyl benzoate (or perhaps permethrin) appears to be the treatment of choice.369, 373 Single-dose ivermectin is also effective at preventing transmission in close contacts.",

It is the third most common OI in HIV disease in northern Thailand, after extrapulmonary tuberculosis and cryptococcal meningitis.374, 375, 376 Infection with P. marneffei was a rare event before the arrival of the AIDS pandemic.376 Since then, thousands of cases have been diagnosed, primarily in southern China, northern Thailand, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Indonesia, and Myanmar.376, 377, 378, 379, 380 The overwhelming majority of cases have been in AIDS patients, although normal hosts are also known to develop systemic disease with this fungus.376, 378, 381 There is a pronounced intracountry variation in infection rates. In northern Thailand, up to one-fourth of AIDS patients suffer disease with it, whereas in southern Thailand the prevalence is 10-fold less.380 It remains unresolved whether the human disease, penicilliosis, results from zoonotic or sapronotic transmission. The ecological reservoirs remain unknown despite more than a decade of research. The organism has been isolated from the organs, feces, and burrows of three species of bamboo rats.374 The geographic range of these rodents overlaps the previously mentioned known areas of endemicity for disease with P. marneffei\n377, 378, 379 and suggests the likelihood that this fungus is also endemic in Laos, Cambodia, and Malaysia.376 Whether bamboo rats are important reservoirs for human infection or just another natural host is unclear. There is no evidence of transmission between rats and humans. The seasonal distribution of the diagnosis of disseminated disease in AIDS patients suggests expansion of the reservoir during the rainy season.377 Exposure to soil appears to be a key factor.382\n",

The development of clinically active disease within weeks of exposure in endemic areas389 and the reports of children with vertically transmitted HIV infection developing disease in the first months and years of life390 demonstrate that primary infection can quickly lead to disseminated disease.

            "text": "The mortality rate of patients with disseminated P. marneffei infection is very high in the absence of prompt treatment. Diagnosis depends on a high index of suspicion, including a careful history to assess residence or travel in an endemic area. The differential diagnosis includes tuberculosis, other endemic fungi, and cryptococcosis. Cutaneous lesions may mimic those of AIDS-related molluscum contagiosum, H. capsulatum and Cryptococcus neoformans. An absence of cutaneous lesions may retard diagnosis. In this regard, a characteristic syndrome of hepatic disease in the absence of skin lesions (fever, hepatomegaly, and markedly elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels) should be noted.391 A presumptive diagnosis can be made by the examination of a Wright's-stained bone marrow aspirate, lymph node aspirate, or touch preparations of skin biopsy specimens.376, 378, 392 Intracellular and extracellular basophilic elliptic yeast-like organisms with central septation (as opposed to the budding of H. capsulatum) are characteristic. P. marneffei has characteristic cross-wall formations within macrophages, appearing as transverse cell walls separating individual conidia, which help in distinguishing it from other conidioform fungi. Indirect fluorescent antibody reagents have been developed that may prove useful for differentiating P. marneffei from H. capsulatum and C. neoformans in tissue.393 Characteristic intracellular organisms have been detected on routine blood smears.394 In the series discussed above, definitive diagnosis was performed by culture of P. marneffei from blood (76%, even in the absence of routine lysis-centrifugation culture), skin biopsy (90%), bone marrow (100%), and sputum (34%). Diagnostic antigenemia tests that may prove valuable for rapid diagnosis have been developed.395, 396 Quantitation of urinary antigen by enzyme immunoassay is especially promising. High sensitivity and specificity were demonstrated in an area of high endemnicity.397 Of note, P. marneffei infection is a known cause of false-positive reactions in the H. capsulatum polysaccharide antigen immunoassay, and also crossreacts with antisera raised against Aspergillus galactomannan.374, 398 Current serologic assays are unlikely to be helpful in the diagnosis of AIDS patients but, with improved sensitivity, may provide a useful index of infection.393, 399\n",

Acute, juvenile disease, occurring in children and young adults and accounting for a small minority of cases (3\u20135%), is marked by a rapid course, disseminated involvement of macrophages and lymphoid tissue, and severe suppression of CMI. Chronic, adult disease, accounting for the vast majority of cases, is a slowly progressive disease, predominantly of older men. In most patients, the primary clinical and pathologic manifestations are pulmonary, with nodular, infiltrative, or cavitary lesions progressing to fibrosis. Other frequent manifestations of adult disease include infiltrative and ulcerative mucosal lesions of the oro- and nasopharynx, polymorphic cutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy, and adrenal infiltration. Most infections are subclinical. Long latency has clearly been demonstrated, with a mean of 15 years between leaving an endemic area and presentation.406\n",

Extracutaneous involvement, including osteoarticular disease, pneumonia, and meningitis, has been described in both normal and immunosuppressed hosts. A handful of cases of severe, disseminated sporotrichosis in late-stage AIDS have been described.427, 428, 429, 430 Diffuse cutaneous involvement is the norm. Some patients have also presented with CNS, ocular, osteoarticular, splenic, bone marrow, and/or mucosal involvement. It appears likely that disseminated Sporothrix will become a more prominent OI in heavily endemic areas. The response to therapy (with amphotericin B, potassium iodide, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and 5-fluorocytosine) has been variable and problematic. Amphotericin B should probably be used for initial treatment, followed by lifelong suppressive therapy with itraconazole.431\n",

            "text": "Throughout the world, there is almost universal serologic evidence of exposure by the age of 2 years to P. jirovecii\n462 (see Chapter 91). The prevalence of antibodies to specific P. jirovecii antigens varies, however, suggesting exposure to antigenically different strains in different areas of the world,463 which is mirrored by genetic studies revealing strain differences in this organism.464 Prior to HAART, PCP (Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, based on the prior terminology) occurred in 40\u201350% of patients in the United States and Europe with a CD4 count less than 100/\u00b5L per year, and in 60\u201380% of patients overall, in the absence of prophylaxis. PCP prevalence appears to be high among AIDS patients in Central and South America and in Asia.465 Interestingly, however, the incidence of PCP in adult AIDS patients in Africa may be far lower than was seen in the pre-HAART era in industrialized countries.465 Adult clinical series in Africa have shown prevalence rates of 0\u201322%.449, 455, 466, 467, 468, 469 Studies including bronchoscopy for diagnosis have described rates of 0\u201339% (the highest figures being obtained as a percentage of acid-fast bacillus-negative pneumonias).455, 466, 470, 471, 472 Autopsy series have had rates of 0\u201311%.231, 468, 473 The reasons for these lower rates are unclear. Possible explanations include less environmental exposure, exposure to differing strains, differences in host susceptibility, earlier deaths in tropical patients with AIDS due to exposure to more virulent organisms, diagnostic difficulties, and host-specific differences in susceptibility.455, 474 The existence of genetically and antigenically distinct human strains is likely; however, pediatric PCP rates in AIDS patients in Africa are quite similar to those in the industrial north.465, 475 Indeed, approximately one-third of HIV-infected infants in Africa die during the first year of life, and PCP is thought to be responsible for 30\u201350% of such deaths.476, 477 Demise from more virulent pathogens prior to clinical PCP may well occur in adults (and PCP does tend to occur early in the course of HIV disease in North American infants,478 perhaps with initial exposure).78 The high prevalence of cryptococcal disease in these same series, which is thought to occur at similar levels of immunosuppression, suggests that this is not the complete answer.455 More recent studies from Africa, using bronchoscopy and improved microbiological identification, have yielded higher rates of PCP, so it is possible that lower rates in earlier studies may have represented reporting bias introduced by the use of suboptimal diagnostic techniques.479, 480\n",

            "text": "The reasons for the apparent absence of disseminated disease due to M. avium in areas of the tropics are unclear. As with the decreased prevalence of PCP, many explanations have been proposed, including less exposure, exposure to less pathogenic variants, differences in host susceptibility, greater acquired immunity to mycobacteria, earlier death by more virulent pathogens, and diagnostic difficulties. Overall exposure to MAC organisms is likely to be similar. Environmental isolation of MAC occurs with similar or greater frequency in Congo and Uganda than in the United States491, 501 and skin test surveys suggest a similar frequency of exposure to MAC in economically developed and developing countries.509 Piped water systems in the United States and Europe have a higher frequency of MAC isolation, however, and economic conditions may lead to greater exposure to MAC-containing droplets via showerheads in economically developed countries;490, 491, 510 such differences, however, are unlikely to lead to an essentially total absence of disease in countries such as Uganda. Exposure to different M. avium serovars or strains may well be important. Data on serotyping of African clinical strains are scarce. Preliminary data suggest that African clinical isolates are distinguishable from European and American isolates by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.511 The possibility of underlying genetic differences in host susceptibility is belied by the similar rates of disseminated M. avium infection as a presenting diagnosis in African and non-African AIDS patients in a London clinic.453 Greater acquired immunity to mycobacterial disease through bacille Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination512 or prior infection with M. tuberculosis may exist, but the reported BCG coverage (50%) and purified protein derivative (PPD) reactivity (82%) in Uganda seem unlikely to explain the lack of any disseminated MAC disease.501 Earlier death due to a greater environmental presence of, or greater latent infection with, more virulent pathogens may occur. This is unlikely to be the entire explanation because patients in many of the previously mentioned studies had clinical late-stage AIDS. Finally, the design of several of the previous studies makes the assertion that the central problem is one of a lack of diagnostic sophistication untenable. Further data from Africa are needed to this puzzling pattern of infections with MAC.",

For comparative purposes, it may be useful to recall that Leishmania, which infects similar cells, is a prominent opportunistic pathogen for patients with HIV infection. The importance of CMI in leprosy and leishmaniasis was emphasized by Turk and Bryceson513 in their detailed comparison of skin lesions and histopathology of both diseases. Moreover, the immunopathology of both infections is very similar. In view of the widespread prevalence of leprosy in the tropics and subtropics, the immunosuppressive effects of HIV/AIDS on leprosy would be expected to become readily apparent, but there is little or no evidence of this interaction. In fact, in a comprehensive analysis of the possible interaction between HIV/AIDS and leprosy, Lucas concluded that leprosy appears to be another \u201cmissing infection in AIDS.\u201d18\n",

One report from a rural hospital in Zambia found a higher prevalence of reactors compared with blood donors and surgical patients (6 of 18 versus 9 of 105), but the numbers were small and the controls were not adequately matched.514 A larger study of HIV seroprevalence in northwest Tanzania of 93 new leprosy cases compared with more than 4000 controls found that the presence of HIV antibody was significantly associated with multibacillary disease.515 The fact that this association was based on only 5 HIV-positive cases with multibacillary disease illustrates the complexity of epidemiologic analysis in a disease such as leprosy. Another comparison of seropositivity for HIV was carried out among 189 new cases of leprosy matched for age, sex, and district of residence with 481 controls in Uganda. No significant difference in overall positive rates was found (12% in cases versus 18% in controls), but again, positive HIV reactions were more frequent among multibacillary cases.516 A different clinical association was noted in Zambia in leprosy patients with active neuritis, which suggested that HIV-positive cases had poorer recovery of nerve function than controls after treatment with steroids.517\n",

Further, there appears to be no striking evidence that HIV infection has an adverse effect on the course of leprosy nor any clear alteration in the clinical spectrum of leprosy among coinfected patients;520 although some suggest that immune-mediated reactions that complicate leprosy occur at a higher frequency in coinfected patients,521, 522 several of the above reports suggest the possibility that multibacillary disease may develop more readily with coinfection. However, there are several features of leprosy that may tend to obscure an interaction with HIV infection. Both infections are chronic and slow in their progression, so it may simply take more time to recognize an influence of one on the other. Leprosy is predominantly a rural infection; HIV/AIDS is more urban. Patients with AIDS in the tropics may not survive long enough to display interactions with leprosy. Finally, patients in the early stages of leprosy have relatively subtle clinical manifestations with which physicians in the urban environment may not be familiar. Therefore, there may be more going on out there than we realize. Leprosy has now been reported presenting as immune reconstitution disease among patients commencing HAART.523\n",

Pathogenesis appears to involve initial GI colonization followed by dissemination.524, 525 The important environmental reservoirs are unclear, but pet birds can have extensive GI tract involvement. The organism may also be present in tap water.526 The geographic range of disease is only beginning to be defined. Cases have been reported from North America, Europe, and Australia.524 The most common presenting symptoms and signs are fever, weight loss, abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, \u201cpseudo-Whipple's disease,\u201d and anemia.524, 527, 528 Imaging of the spleen may suggest splenic abscesses;529 diffuse nodular infiltrates may be seen in the lung.530 Pathologically, involved organs are filled with histiocytes that are packed with acid-fast bacilli. The diagnosis can be established by the isolation of M. genavense from normally sterile sites (blood, bone marrow, lymph node, and spleen). Specific diagnosis is confounded by the fastidious growth requirements of the organism. Primary isolation on solid media is difficult, and growth in liquid broth may have only 50% sensitivity. Definitive identification demands PCR techniques.524 The clear implication is that a significant percentage of cases ascribed to disseminated M. avium are likely due to M. genavense.527 Data on treatment are all retrospective, but therapy appears to be associated both with improvement in symptoms and with survival. Multidrug regimens that include clarithromycin appear to be associated with the best clinical responses.531, 532 Like other nontuberculous mycobacteria, M. genovense has also been reported to declare itself during IRIS.533\n",

Mere colonization of the respiratory tract with M. kansasii appears to be infrequent in AIDS patients, however. All pulmonary isolates should be taken seriously.538, 540 Despite relative in vitro resistance to isoniazid,541 the recommended therapy is isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol.

            "text": "Along with other genital inflammatory diseases, syphilis (see Chapter 138) has been implicated as a cofactor in HIV transmission. Many case reports have suggested that HIV infection can alter the course of disease with Treponema pallidum. In the presence of concurrent HIV infection, syphilis has been thought to: (1) progress more frequently and rapidly to neurosyphilis;571, 572 (2) lead to an increased incidence of meningitic manifestations of neurosyphilis;573 (3) lead to an increased frequency of \u201cmalignant secondary syphilis\u201d with ulcerating lesions and prominent systemic symptoms;574 and (4) be less amenable to successful therapy with standard regimens as assessed by clinical or serologic measures (including a lack of appropriate nontreponemal titer reduction or a serologic relapse).575, 576, 577, 578, 579, 580 Higher rates of serological failure continue to be reported in the post-HAART era, but it has become clear that effective suppression of HIV viremia clearly increases the rates of serological responses to standard therapy.581, 582, 583, 584 Concerns about effectiveness of standard therapy for syphilis in HIV-positive individuals, based largely on case reports and retrospective studies, were amplified by the disconcerting finding of T. pallidum invasion of the CNS in early syphilis in HIV-infected patients. Such early invasion of the CNS occurs equally frequently in HIV-seropositive and seronegative people, however,585 and the above \u201catypical\u201d courses of syphilis were well-known in the pre-AIDS era. Knowledge of the actual frequency and relative significance of such events awaited well-designed prospective studies. Three studies now provide evidence that the clinical presentation and clinical and serologic responses to treatment of syphilis may not be appreciably altered by HIV coinfection.586, 587, 588 A major caveat of these studies is that the mean level of immunosuppression in the patients in these studies, as assessed by CD4+ T-cell counts, was not severe. Furthermore, the number of patients involved was relatively small. Thus, the clinical course of syphilis in the face of severe HIV-induced immunosuppression may in fact be exacerbated, and the response to conventional therapy may lead to the infrequent occurrence of serious adverse treatment outcomes.588 The clinical approach to the HIV patient infected with this cosmopolitan sexually transmitted disease has been thoroughly discussed elsewhere76, 77, 78, 589, 590 and will likely continue to evolve.",

Notably, these pathogens are obligate intracellular parasites of monocyte/macrophages. C. burnetii lives and multiplies in the phagolysosomes of monocyte/macrophages, and host defense appears to depend on specific T-cell activation of the microbicidal effector functions of infected cells.596, 597 Case series have suggested that patients with immunocompromise due to a variety of causes (including leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, bone marrow and renal transplantation, and alcoholism) are more susceptible to both symptomatic acute and relapsing or chronic disease with C. burnetii.598, 599, 600 While the rationale for expecting more frequent or serious disease in the HIV-infected patient is clear, supporting data are sparse. A study from southern France demonstrated a threefold higher prevalence of antibodies to C. burnetii in HIV-seropositive people.601 This suggestion of an increased rate of transmission in HIV-infected people has not been found in other seroprevalence studies from Paris, Spain, or the Central African Republic.602, 603, 604 Given the differential prevalence of risk factors for the acquisition of HIV infection between the studies, the contradictory data strongly suggest that C. burnetii can be bloodborne and that intravenous drug use is a risk for its transmission. Two studies from southern Europe have further suggested that HIV infection leads to a higher disease-to-infection ratio with C. burnetii.601, 605 A retrospective serologic study of 520 patients with acute Q fever from an area of Spain with a high incidence of both HIV and C. burnetii infection revealed no overrepresentation of HIV-infected people, however, with endocarditis being a common presentation.604, 606, 607 The clinical features of Q fever do not appear to vary between HIV-infected and uninfected hosts.601, 603, 604, 605 However, definitive statements await prospective studies in severely immunosuppressed AIDS patients.",

Of 8 reported cases of disease caused by E. ewingii, a related tick-borne agent, 7 occurred in patients with immune deficiencies, including 4 with HIV infection.609, 612 The suspicion is thus strong that E. ewingii is an opportunistic pathogen in the setting of HIV infection.613 No cases of infection with the tick-borne agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis614 in the face of HIV infection appear to have been reported.",

Data from the tropics on enteric bacterial pathogens are scant. Studies of slim disease (enteropathic AIDS) have not revealed an enteric bacterial cause in most cases.349, 503, 504 The prevalence of certain enteric pathogens such as Campylobacter, Vibrio, and enteropathogenic E. coli in the tropics has not been accurately assessed because their detection requires the use of special media and experienced laboratory personnel. In the case of less fastidious organisms that are easier to detect, such as Salmonella spp., the phenomenon of bacteremia with nontyphoid organisms has been noted in tropical Africa.27, 249, 628 Since bacteremia with Shigella spp. probably occurs more commonly in patients with HIV disease,631 this association may be expected to occur in the tropics as well. There is no reported evidence to suggest that cholera is altered in the presence of HIV, although the gastric secretory failure that occurs commonly in AIDS may lead to a greater susceptibility to infection with Vibrio cholerae.632, 633 It should be noted that, although the live oral cholera vaccine is considered to be contraindicated in people with HIV infection by the US Public Health Service (USPHS)\u2013Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) working group,235 it has been shown to be safe and immunogenic in HIV-infected adults in Mali.634\n",

There are theoretical risks of vaccine-induced encephalitis and/or hepatic damage due to prolonged viremia in the immunodeficient.644 A handful of cases of postvaccinial encephalitis or multiple-organ failure (yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease) have been reported in presumably immunocompetent patients (against a denominator of approximately 400 million people vaccinated).644 Of note, 4 of 23 vaccinees who developed yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease had undergone thymectomy for thymomas, raising the concern that T-cell deficiency may be a risk factor.648 A single case has also been reported of fatal myeloencephalitis after vaccination in a Thai man with asymptomatic HIV infection, albeit a low CD4+ T-cell count and a high viral load.649 Approximately 100 asymptomatic HIV-seropositive US military personnel received yellow fever vaccination prior to the introduction of routine HIV screening; no adverse effects were detected (R. Redfield, personal communication, 1997). Small published series of travelers have suggested safety and variable efficacy of the 17D yellow fever vaccine in HIV seropositives without severe immunosuppression,650, 651, 652 a concept bolstered by retrospective analysis of 102 patients in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study who received yellow fever vaccine.653 As might be expected, the latter study noted reduced vaccine immunogenicity and a more rapid decline in titers of neutralizing antibody in those with HIV infection. The immunogenicity of yellow fever vaccination has also been noted to be severely reduced, again in the absence of significant adverse events, in HIV-infected children in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.654 WHO recommendations are to use yellow fever vaccine in HIV-seropositive patients who are asymptomatic; it remains a part of the WHO EPI.655 Pending further studies, yellow fever vaccine is not recommended for symptomatic HIV-infected patients by WHO.655 The ACIP recommends that HIV-infected people without AIDS or other symptomatic manifestations of HIV infection, who have laboratory-established verification of adequate immune function, and who cannot avoid potential exposure to yellow fever be offered the choice of vaccination.656, 657 As genetic evidence has implicated disruption of the CCR5/RANTES axis in a previously healthy, HIV-uninfected vaccinee who developed viscerotropic disease after vaccination,658 it would be prudent to avoid such vaccination in patients receiving CCR5 antagonists.659 Given apparent reduced vaccination efficiency, neutralizing antibody titers should probably be measured prior to travel. If travel requirements (as opposed to actual risk of infection) are the only reason for vaccination of an asymptomatic HIV-infected person, a vaccination waiver letter (not accepted at some borders) should be obtained.657 For all travelers, avoidance of areas of transmission and, if travel to such areas is essential, conscientiously avoiding mosquito exposure is prudent.",

An initial study of children with measles in Lusaka revealed a significantly higher mortality rate in HIV seropositives (28%) than seronegatives (8.3%).675 A second prospective study in hospitalized children in Lusaka that distinguished between HIV infection and HIV seropositivity found few differences in the clinical presentation, complications, or mortality of HIV-infected compared to -uninfected children with measles.676 However, enrollment was based on a clinical diagnosis of measles, which would be expected to minimize the ability to detect differences in clinical presentation; there was a bias against enrollment of critically ill children and those dying soon after admission; and there was significantly greater mortality among HIV-infected compared with -uninfected children among those with clinically diagnosed as opposed to confirmed measles.676 Early death prior to mounting diagnostic measles IgM titers in the face of severe immunosuppression was suspected to be confounding. Indeed, extension of enrollment in this study revealed that HIV coinfection led to a more than two-fold increase in measles mortality.662 Other positive findings in these studies included a higher proportion of HIV infection among children hospitalized with measles than expected from (maternal) population prevalence rates, a greater proportion of coinfected patients hospitalized with measles younger than the age of 9 months, and a longer duration of illness before hospitalization and longer hospitalization in coinfected children.676 Follow-up studies have shown that coinfected patients have a higher risk (90.9% vs. 52.8%) for prolonged (30\u201361 days after rash onset) shedding of measles virus;677 and that in vivo HIV replication is suppressed during acute measles.678\n",

            "text": "Safety concerns have obviously been of great importance in the use of this live-attenuated vaccine in HIV patients. The use of measles vaccine had appeared to be quite safe in HIV-infected children and adults,694 although two reports have emphasized the need for some caution. A 20-year-old man with no HIV-related symptoms but a CD4+ T-cell count \u201ctoo few to enumerate\u201d received a second dose of measles vaccine prior to entry into college. One year after vaccination, he developed progressive, vaccine-associated measles pneumonitis.695 A study of the effect of HIV on measles mortality in 356 children hospitalized with measles in Lusaka, Zambia, is also troubling.675 Previous studies have suggested that when prior measles vaccination does not prevent disease, it can reduce the severity of infection.674 In HIV-seronegative boys hospitalized for measles, prior measles vaccination did lead to a significantly lower case-fatality rate.675 Although case fatality rates were not significantly lower in vaccinated HIV-seropositive boys or HIV-seronegative girls than in their unvaccinated controls, there was a trend toward a lower case fatality rate in the vaccinees. Surprisingly, however, the case fatality rate was higher in measles-vaccinated than in unvaccinated HIV-seropositive girls. Although this did not reach statistical significance, it is reminiscent of the experience with the high-titered Edmonston\u2013Zagreb (EZ) vaccine. Use of high-titered EZ vaccine at less than 9 months of age was associated with a delayed excess mortality in several study sites.696, 697, 698 This occurred exclusively in female infants for reasons that remain unclear. It is notable that in the Zambian study noted previously, the highest mortality was seen in the youngest, vaccinated HIV-seropositive girls. However, in regions where there is measles transmission, risk\u2013benefit analysis clearly favors measles immunization of all children regardless of HIV status.691 In regions where measles transmission does not occur and where immune status can be monitored, withholding of measles vaccine from HIV-infected children with severe immune compromise is wise.691 WHO recommends measles vaccination for all children in developing countries regardless of HIV infection or symptom status because of the high risk and severity of measles in general in such countries.693, 699\n",

The applicability to much of the tropics is less clear, however, given differing spectra of OIs, differences in antibiotic resistance patterns, and differences in sociocultural acceptability or feasibility of preventive measures. Limits in the availability of health care resources (including not just an inability to support the cost of many prevention regimens but also an inability to diagnose HIV disease early enough for preventive measures to be effective, to stage the degree of HIV-associated immunosuppression reliably, and to diagnose OIs definitively) also directly influence the range of prevention options and priorities. It should also be noted that, compared with HAART (or prevention of HIV infection), the benefit of OI prevention in reducing HIV-related morbidity and mortality may be somewhat modest.754 Adequate global provision of HAART represents an ongoing, immense challenge, however, and wide implementation of simple, cheap, effective OI prevention strategies provides an opportunity to reduce morbidity and mortality rapidly and widely.744\n",

The potential mechanism remains unclear; not surprisingly, the study remains controversial. The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts of the WHO has recommended that the licensed 7-serotype conjugate vaccine (PCV-7), already used in developed countries, be introduced in countries where HIV is a significant cause of mortality and in populations with a high prevalence of other underlying conditions that increase the risk of pneumococcal disease, such as sickle cell disease.771 The PCV-7 vaccine can be easily integrated into routine vaccination schedules, with the possibility of being administered at the same time as other vaccines in infant immunization programs.771\n",
