However, some of the low positive Abbott Testpack Strep A and Cards Strep A plus and minus endpoints had an irregularly or partially filled vertical line that was neither clearly positive nor clearly negative, making interpretation difficult. The Icon Strep A tests resulted in the presence or absence of a clearly outlined central dot on a white background, giving unequivocal results, with only minimal experience required for interpretation.",

Some studies used selective media or anerobic incubation for their throat cultures, some used single or double swabs, some used hospital laboratory facilities, and others used small clinic offices and office personnel. With such a variety of settings and test conditions, it is difficult to compare one test with another, and as reported recently, there are widely differing results for the same GABHS ADT, depending on the circumstances under which it is tested?. 6 Despite the limitations of an in vitro study in making clinical assessments, this study does provide a common ground for comparing these eight commonly used ADTs under identical, simultaneous conditions. Such identical experimental conditions cannot be obtained from clinical specimens, making valid comparisons between ADTs difficult.",

Hospitals or clinics considering adopting one of these newer kits would undoubtedly also find this approach useful in finding an ADT that best fits their needs. As a result of this study, we have selected the Tandem Icon Strep A for further clinical evaluation in our pediatric clinic. ",

The diagnosis of acute otitis media was based on signs and symptoms of acute infection and on the presence of fluid in the middle ear. Nineteen patients were receiving antibiotic therapy. The study population consisted of 84 boys and 59 girls. Twenty-five patients were younger than 6 months of age; 39 patients were between 6 months and 12 months; 50 were between 1 and two years of age; 29 patients were older than 2 years (mean age 1.5 years; range 19 days to 12.4 years). Middle ear fluid was obtained by tympanocentesis. After collection, a fraction of the fluid was used for routine bacterial culture (134 specimens were taken). For virus isolation a cotton stick was dipped in the middle ear fluid sample and placed in a vial containing 2 ml virus transport medium (0.5% bovine albumin in tryptosephosphate broth containing antibiotics). Nasopharyngeat secretions for virus isolation were aspirated from the nasopharynx through the nostrils in 116 patients. The virus isolation specimens were frozen within 2 hours on dry ice or transported immediately to the laboratory and stored at -70 ~ C until processed. Virus isolation was done as described earlier, with some modifications. 7 One hundred microliters of each specimen was inoculated into duplicate roller-tube cultures of HeLa Ohio cells (donated by Dr. D.A.J. Tyrrell, MCR Common Cold Unit, Salisbury, England) and of human fibroblasts prepared in our laboratory. The cultures were stored in a roller apparatus (12 rev/hr) at 33 ~ C and examined microscopically every second day. After 6 days of incubation a blind passage was done of negative HeLa cultures and the passages were incubated for another week. On a few occasions a second blind passage was performed. Rhinovirus was identified by its typical cytopathogenic effect and lability to acid treatment.",

The virus isolation samples were frozen at -70 ~ C within 2 hours after sampling. A blind passage was done of negative HeLa Ohio cell cultures, which increased the sensitivity of virus isolation. Furthermore, secretions were aspirated from the nasopharynx through the nostrils and a large amount of mucus was usually obtained, from which a swab was taken for virus isolation. We suggest that this collection method may have contributed to the relatively high frequency of rhinovirus infections detected.",
