According to previous studies, during the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), frontline medical staff had reported high levels of stress that resulted in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [1, 2] . The risk factors of psychological stress in medical staff had been previously investigated during the SARS and MERS epidemics. In 2008, Styra et al., in Toronto, identified four major risk factors for stress in medical staff during the SARS outbreak, including the perception of the medical of their risk of infection, the impact of SARS on their work, feelings of depression, and working in high-risk medical units [3] . The perception of infection risk by medical staff was previously reported by Tam et al. in 2003 to be significantly associated with their risk of developing PTSD [1] . Other factors, including social stigmatization and contact with infected patients, has previously been shown to be associated with increased levels of stress and anxiety in medical staff [2] .",

Recently, Peeri et al. reported that the infection rate of medical staff during the SARS and MERS outbreaks reached 21% and 18.6%, respectively, which resulted in adverse psychological effects, including anxiety and depression [5] . Medical staff have been infected and have died during the COVID-19 epidemic in China, there are no treatments for this infection, and no vaccines have been developed [6] . All these factors contribute to increased psychological stress of frontline medical staff in China, which may have immediate or long-psychological consequences that may have acute or chronic somatic effects that result in conditions such as cardiac arrhythmia and myocardial infarction [7] . However, there have been few studies that have investigated the coping strategies that frontline medical staff can use during disease epidemics. Personality traits, such as optimism, resilience, and altruism, have previously been shown to have positive effects on reducing psychological stress [6, 8] . Objective measures may reduce psychological stress, including effective infection control, personal protective measures, clear institutional policies and protocols, which may help to reduce stress in medical staff [9] . Recognition and appreciation of the work and efforts by the medical profession, hospital management, government, and society have a positive impact on stress experienced by medical staff during epidemics [10] . Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the psychological impact and coping strategies of frontline medical staff in Hunan province, adjacent to Hubei province, during the COVID-19 outbreak between January and March 2020.",

Medical staff between 31 -40 years of age had the greatest concern regarding viral transmission to their families, possibly because most of them had young children and living parents in their families. These findings were also reported among medical staff during the SARS epidemic but were less significant [15] . Another cause of stress for the medical staff in this study was an awareness of the mortality rate from COVID-19 infection. All age groups in this study expressed psychological stress when they saw their colleagues under stress. Therefore, hospital managers and governments should improve interventions for preventing the spread of epidemics, promote disease treatment methods, and also offer psychological support for medical staff. In the present study, the study participants showed less concern regarding the new cases and lack of treatment for COVID-19, which was not consistent with previous studies during other infectious disease epidemics [10] . Medical staff were satisfied with current protection measures, the numbers of medical staff, medical equipment, and medical resources, although these were identified as problems by the general public and the media [8] . This finding might be explained because, at the time of this study, the COVID-19 epidemic in Hunan was not as severe as that in Wuhan and Hubei, and disease prevention measures in Hunan were being instigated, and medical workers and the general population were better informed about these measures [16] .",

A positive working environment with the re-assurance of personal safety while at work during the COVID-19 epidemic were the two main factors that might be key to encourage medical staff to continue working during the epidemic. Also, awareness of the effects of disease prevention measures with reduced numbers of reported cases reduced staff stress. Financial or other forms of remuneration were not significant concerns by medical staff in this study. The personal coping strategies that were used by medical staff to reduce stress during the COVID-19 epidemic is an important topic to investigate that requires further long-term studies as in China and throughout the world.

The study was designed as a cross-sectional observational study that included doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff throughout Hunan province and was of short duration, conducted between January and March 2020. However, psychological stress can accumulate over time and have an impact later in the outbreak, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which should be investigated in future studies. Also, although the staff included in this study were all from frontline medical departments that included departments of infectious diseases, emergency medicine, fever clinics, intensive care units, radiology, and laboratory medicine, this study did not analyze the differences between workers in different departments.",

The findings showed that the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei resulted in increased workload and stress for medical staff in the adjacent province of Hunan. The main factors associated with stress included the perceived risk of infection to themselves and their families, patient mortality, the availability of clear infection control guidance, the availability of effective protective equipment, recognition of their work by hospital authorities, and a decrease in reported cases of COVID-19. Staff support and the provision of facilities and equipment by hospital managers and the government are required to retain and encourage medical staff involvement in future epidemics.",
