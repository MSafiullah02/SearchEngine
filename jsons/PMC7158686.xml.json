Recognition of the unique quality of Galician beef prompted the European Union (EU) to accept, in 1996, the Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) of Galician Veal \u201cTernera Gallega\u201d, which comprises pure RG and its crosses (CEE, 1996). The PGI \u201cTernera Gallega\u201d classifies the animals as calves (98%) and yearling bulls (2%) depending on whether slaughter was earlier or later than ten months of age, respectively. Two classes of veal are commercialized, the \u201cNormal\u201d class calves (40%) suckle their mothers for at least two months and are weaned before being slaughtered, and the \u201cSuprema\u201d class calves (60%) suckle their mothers throughout their life (Ternera, Gallega, 2008).",

Artificial lactation calves, weaned when they were two months old (W2), showed the highest daily gain during the finishing period. These results could be due to compensatory growth (O'Donovan, 1984, Ryan et al., 1993) after an under nutrition period because of the adaptation of the W2 calves to suckle from a bucket instead of their mothers. Moreover, since W2 calves started having solid food earlier, their rumen development could have happened sooner (Baldwin et al., 2004, Tamate et al., 1962) than in NW and W5 calves, which favours a higher intake capacity. W5 calves showed the lowest ADG values (Table 1); however, after being weaned, these animals ingested higher amounts of feed (CI) than the NW group. The extra concentrate ingested by W5 calves was not enough to compensate the energy supplied by dam's milk in the NW group over the same period.",

Many studies consider that nutrition has no major influence on meat ultimate pH (Crouse et al., 1984, Dufrasne et al., 1995, Hornick et al., 1995, Hornick et al., 1998), however other authors (Albert\u00ed & Sa\u00f1udo, 1987, Albert\u00ed et al., 1988, Sierra et al., 1988) found higher pH values in meat from animals finished on concentrate for long periods. In NW and W5 animals, the finishing period with concentrate was three months shorter than in W2 group (Table 1), this could account for the higher LT pH in W2 meat. It is important to note that the pH values were below 5.8, in the normal range for beef (Garrido & Ba\u00f1\u00f3n, 2001, Renerre, 1996). When the pH is over this value the meat is unattractive (Monserrat, S\u00e1nchez, Fern\u00e1ndez, Viana, & De La Calle, 1997), termed DFD (dry, firm and dark) (Garrido, & Ba\u00f1\u00f3n, 2001) and is less acceptable to consumers than normal pH meat (Viljoen, Kock, & Webb, 2002). Other authors have reported that weaning status had no influence on the pH of ruminants' muscles (Blanco et al., 2009, Oliete et al., 2006, Velasco et al., 2004).",
