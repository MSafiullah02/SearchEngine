            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of viruses that co-infect humans and other vertebrate animals. CoV infections affect the respiratory, gastrointestinal, liver, and central nervous systems of humans, livestock, birds, bats, mice, and many other wild animals [1,2,3]. For example, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 were both coronaviruses that transmitted from animals to humans [4,5]. The source of unexplained pneumonia was first discovered in Wuhan in Dec, 2019, and SARS-CoV-2, a new coronavirus, was isolated from the respiratory epithelium of patients. It belongs to a new evolutionary branch within the CoV. On Feb. 11th, 2020, the new coronavirus was officially renamed \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d from \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d [6]. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was called \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201d (COVID-19) [7]. According to the data released by the National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China, SARS-CoV-2 was most likely transmitted from wild bats to humans, and all the above three CoVs can transmit from person to person [8,9,10]. SARS-CoV-2 shares a highly similar gene sequence and behavior pattern with SARS-CoV [11]. This paper summarized the similarities and differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, both of which cause major disease outbreaks in China and worldwide, which will provide comprehensive reference for epidemic prevention.",

COVID-19 can be classified into light, normal, severe, and critical types based on the severity of the disease [31]: (1) Mild cases\u2014the clinical symptoms were mild, and no pneumonia was found on the chest computed tomography (CT); (2) normal cases\u2014fever, respiratory symptoms, and patients found to have imaging manifestations of pneumonia; (3) severe cases\u2014one of the following three conditions: Respiratory distress, respiratory rate \u2265 30 times/min (in resting state, refers to oxygen saturation \u2264 93%), partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2)/oxygen absorption concentration (FiO2) \u2264 300 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa); (4) critical cases\u2014one of the following three conditions: Respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation, shock, or the associated failure of other organs requiring the intensive care unit [32]. The current clinical data shows that the majority of the deaths occurred in the older patients.

Those with a long-term use of hormones or immunosuppressants, and decreased immune function, are likely to get severely infected.",

So far, the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 are elusive and have been reported to be snakes, minks, or variable others [50,51]. Recently, a research group of South China Agricultural University reported that pangolins may be one of the intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2, by analyzing more than 1,000 metagenomic samples, because they found that 70% of pangolins are positive for the coronavirus. Moreover, the virus isolate from pangolin shared 99% sequence similarity with the current infected human strain SARS-CoV-2 [52]. Taking this recent research into consideration, we agreed that pangolin is more likely to be one of intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.",

As the origin area of COVID-19, Hubei province has been the most severely infected area, with 54,406 cumulative diagnosis cases. Wuhan city has 37,914 cases. Guangdong, Henan, and Zhejiang province have 1,294 cases, 1,212 cases, and 1,162 cases, respectively (Figure 2d). At present, the COVID-19 outbreak has been spread to all parts of China and around the world, including the United States, Thailand, and Japan. It has been noticed that most of these patients have ever been to Wuhan or contacted with people who had been in Wuhan.

It was shown that human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has spread via droplets or close contacts [58,59], but aerosol and fecal-oral transmission still need further study [60,61]. To reduce virus transmission, early detection and isolation are essential. In addition, close monitoring in crowded places is also important [62]. The possible pathogens of SARS and COVID-19 are both derived from wild animals [63]. Therefore, hunting, selling, and eating wild animals not only seriously damage the ecosystem, but also lead to the spread of epidemic diseases [64]. Thus, banning all wildlife trade is an effective measure to prevent viral prevalence. Wearing level-D protective clothing can protect medical staff from infection of respiratory viruses [65]. A vaccine against SARS-CoV has not been described in any published articles [66]. However, on Jan. 26th, 2020, the China CDC started to develop a new vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. The virus has been successfully isolated and seed strains have been screened [67].",

Now, isolation, antiviral, and symptomatic treatments are still mainly adopted for COVID-19 treatment. As effective drugs for SARS, hormones and interferons can also be used to treat COVID-19 [74]. Lopinavir is one kind of protease inhibitor used to treat HIV infection, with ritonavir as a booster. Lopinavir and/or ritonavir has anti coronavirus activity in vitro. Hong Kong scholars found that, compared with ribavirin alone, patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin had lower risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or death caused by SARS-CoV [76,77]. Lopinavir/ritonavir has also been clinically tested in treatment of COVID-19, and showed wonderfully effective treatment for some patients, but the general clinical effect has not been determined [78].",

Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are in the coronavirus family, \u03b2-coronavirus genera [89]. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is more than 85% similar to the genome of the SARS-like virus ZC45 (bat-SL-CoVZC45, MG772933.1), and together these types of viruses form a unique Orthocoronavirinae subfamily with another SARS-like virus ZXC21 in the sarbecovirus subgenus [35]. All the three viruses show typical \u03b2-coronavirus gene structure. Human SARS-CoV and a genetically similar bat coronavirus (bat-SL-CoVZXC21, MG772934) from southwest of China have formed another clade within the sarbecovirus [35].",

The receptor-binding motif (RBM) of S protein can directly contact ACE2 [47,101,102]. AEC2 have been identified to be key binding residues and functional receptor for SARS-CoV, and it can also protect alveolar cells [103]. The binding of spike protein to ACE2 and the subsequent downregulation of this receptor contribute to severe alveolar injury during SARS [49]. The downregulation of ACE2 results in the excessive production of angiotensin II by the related enzyme ACE, and the stimulation of type 1A angiotensin II receptor (AGTR1A) can lead to the increase of pulmonary vascular permeability, which potentially explains the increased lung pathology when the expression of ACE2 is decreased [104]. ACE2-transfected T cells form multinucleated syncytia with cells expressing S protein. The virus was shown to replicate effectively in ACE2-transfected, but not in mock-transfected T cells.

On Feb. 14th, 2020, there were more than 54,000 confirmed patients in Hubei province, China [55]. Due to the lack of effective antiviral drugs, the prognosis of patients solely depends on their age and physical condition [74]. Although it was reported that the clinically recovered patients exceed the number of dead, the majority of the patients are still not cured in hospital. In addition, the potential adaptive mutation of SARS-CoV-2 makes it difficult for vaccine development. Therefore, it is urgent for us to develop more sensitive inspection methods and effective drugs.",

The latest one is SARS-CoV-2. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 shared almost 80% of the genome with SARS-CoV [11]. Our results also showed that almost all encoded proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are homologous to SARS-CoV proteins (Table 2). Hence, clinical drugs and therapies for treating SARS may be used as a reference for COVID-19 treatment [74].",

It mainly occurs in Saudi Arabia and has a high mortality rate [66]. Studies had demonstrated that the clinical course of SARS and MERS was highly similar, and SARS and MERS may have similar pathogenesis [66]. The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 also shows some similarities to that of MERS-CoV.
