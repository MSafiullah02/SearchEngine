            "text": "A number of viruses and viral proteins interact with a dynamic subnuclear structure called the nucleolus. The nucleolus is present during interphase in mammalian cells and is the site of ribosome biogenesis, and has been implicated in controlling regulatory processes such as the cell cycle. Viruses interact with the nucleolus and its antigens; viral proteins co-localise with factors such as nucleolin, B23 and fibrillarin, and can cause their redistribution during infection. Viruses can use these components as part of their replication process, and also use the nucleolus as a site of replication itself. Many of these properties are not restricted to any particular type of virus or replication mechanism, and examples of these processes can be found in DNA, RNA and retroviruses. Evidence suggests that viruses may target the nucleolus and its components to favour viral transcription, translation and perhaps alter the cell cycle in order to promote virus replication. Autoimmunity to nucleolin and fibrillarin have been associated with a number of diseases, and by targeting the nucleolus and displacing nucleolar antigens, virus infection might play a role in the initiation of these conditions.",

Recently, however, the nucleolus has been implicated in many aspects of cell biology that include functions such as gene silencing, senescence, and cell cycle regulation [8, 50, 51] .",

Nucleolin (first called C23), represents approximately 10% of the total nucleolar protein content and is highly phosphorylated, methylated, and also can be ADP-ribosylated [25] . Nucleolin has the potential to bind to multiple RNA targets and this may reflect its variety of functions [25, 26] . One of the main functions of nucleolin is facilitating the first cleavage step of rRNA in the presence of U3 snoRNP. Nucleolin may function as a chaperone for correct folding in pre-rRNA processing [27] . Nucleolin has also been implicated as a repressor of transcription [78] . Whilst mammalian nucleolin has a predicted molecular mass of approximately 77 kDa (depending on the species), the apparent molecular mass is between 100 and 110 kDa, and has been attributed to the amino acid composition of the N-terminal domain, which is highly phosphorylated [25] .",

During interphase in higher eukaryotic cells the number of nucleoli vary depending on the stage of the cell cycle, and the nucleolus disappears at the start of mitosis [2] . During G 1 cells can contain more than one nucleolus. This is probably reflected in the fact that these cells are translationally active, and therefore require more ribosomes, whose synthesis may in turn be controlled by the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) pathway [74] . As the cells progress through S phase and into G 2 , where single nucleoli can be present. The nucleolus then disperses during mitosis. At telophase nucleogenesis involves the distribution of material derived from the mother cell toward the active NORs of the daughter nuclei and form pre-nucleolar bodies (PNBs) [19] . Subsequent nucleolar reformation is a dynamic and complex process [4] . Cajal bodies associate with nucleoli, and contain many similar components such as fibrillarin [55, 69] , and they sequester CDK2 and cyclin E in a cell cycle dependent manner [40] . The concentration of nucleolin and B23 [68] and the distribution of fibrillarin are dependent on the cell cycle [4, 23] . Nucleolin is stable in proliferative cells, but undergoes self-cleavage in quiescent cells [11] (e.g. Fig. 2 , lane 1) and has been suggested to be involved in regulation of cell growth and proliferation [70] .

A number of viral proteins localise to the nucleolus, with examples from animal retroviruses and DNA viruses, and animal and plant RNA viruses (Table 1) . Why viral proteins localise to the nucleolus has not been precisely determined, although given the multifunctional role of the nucleolus several activities could be targeted, including cellular transcription [39, 56] , virus transcription [46] , virus translation [28] or cell division [77] .",

For example, an adenovirus infection results in the redistribution of nucleolin and B23 [46] and Okuwaki et al. [49] have shown that B23 stimulates adenovirus replication. Nucleolin is prevented from entering the nucleus in poliovirus-infected cells [76] . Nucleolin has been shown to interact with the poliovirus 3 non-coding region (NCR) and as a result, was suggested to be involved in replication [76] . In addition, nucleolin was shown to stimulate IRES-mediated translation of the poliovirus genome [30] . Nucleolar targeting and an interaction with nucleolin has been shown to promote hepatitis delta virus (HDV) replication [35] . Adenovirus [56] and coronavirus [13] infection results in the redistribution of fibrillarin. By altering the distribution of fibrillarin, viruses might be reducing polI transcription i.e. the synthesis of rRNA, as blocking fibrillarin with antibody prevented its translocation to nucleoli and resulted in the reduction or inhibition of polI transcription [23] . Interestingly PolI transcription is disrupted in adenovirus-infected cells [10] . Nucleolin (and proteins belonging to the nucleolin super-family) have been suggested to act as possible cell surface receptor for coxsackie B viruses [58] and HIV [7] , and a nucleolin-gag interaction may be involved in the assembly of Moloney murine leukaemia virus [5] .",

            "text": "A number of factors can determine whether a protein localises to the nucleolus. Soluble proteins of less than 40-60 kDa can diffuse passively into the nucleoplasm through the nuclear pore complex, and could in principal diffuse in and out of the nucleolar compartment [54, 59] . Non-specific RNA binding proteins that diffuse into the nucleus may therefore be expected to become concentrated in the nucleolus because a large amount of rRNA is present. The transport of larger proteins through the nuclear pore is an active process requiring ATP and nuclear localisation signals (NLSs), which also make up (in part) nucleolar localisation signals (NuLS). NLSs include the 'pat4' motif, which consists of a continuous stretch of four basic amino acids (arginine and lysine), and the 'pat7' motif, which starts with a proline and is followed within three residues by a segment containing three basic residues out of four [24] , or a bipartite signal [60] . Localisation of a protein to the nucleolus is probably a result of targeting to the nucleus via NLSs followed by an interaction between the target molecules (via the NuLS) and components that make up the nucleolus [8, 65] . An example of a protein that localises to the nucleolus in this manner is nucleolin, which contains a bipartite NLS and associates with rRNA in the nucleolus via RNA binding domains [64] . Some viral proteins that localise to the nucleolus can also be found in the nucleoplasm, e.g. MDV MEQ [39] suggesting some viral proteins localise to the nucleolus do so by diffusing through the nuclear pore, into the nucleoplasm, and associating with nucleolar factors in the nucleolus. Alternatively viral proteins might stay associated with nucleolar antigens such as nucleolin and fibrillarin, which are exchanged between the nucleoplasm and the nucleolus [12] .",

Nucleolin was detected using C23 (human) goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Laboratories). The positions of molecular weight markers (kDa) are shown to the left. The position of mature nucleolin is arrowed [28, 77] ) or stretches of basic residues, for example adenovirus protein V [46] or MDV MEQ protein [39] . Interestingly, Matthews [46] identified a possible bipartite NuLS in adenovirus protein V ( Table 2 , amino acids 157-184).
