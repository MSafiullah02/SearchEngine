The inevitable, but unpredictable emergence of new infectious diseases has become a global threat. HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the more recent H1N1 influenza are only a few of the numerous examples of emerging infectious diseases in the modern era. However despite advances in diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines, there is need for more specific, efficacious, cost-effective and less toxic treatment and preventive drugs. In this chapter, we discuss a powerful combinatorial technology in association with animal immunisation that is capable of generating biologic drugs with high affinity, efficacy and limited off-site toxicity, and diagnostic tools with great precision. Although time consuming, immunisation still remains the preferred route for the isolation of high-affinity antibodies and antibody-like fragments. Phage display is a molecular diversity technology that allows the presentation of large peptide and protein libraries on the surface of filamentous phage. The selection of binding fragments from phage display libraries has proven significant for routine isolation of invaluable peptides, antibodies, and antibody-like domains for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Here we highlight the many benefits of combining immunisation with phage display in combating infectious diseases, and how our knowledge of antibody engineering has played a crucial role in fully exploiting these platforms in generating therapeutic and diagnostic biologics towards antigenic targets of infectious organisms.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The number of monoclonal antibody (mAb) based drugs developed by biopharmaceutical companies is at an all-time high with more and more novel anti-infective antibodies gaining regulatory approval.

A limited number of human mAbs were also developed by using human B lymphocytes from naturally infected patients but this proved a technically challenging and generally unreliable approach [48] . Subsequent advances in antibody engineering removed or resolved many of these technology \"road-blocks\" facilitating the generation of chimeric, humanised or deimmunised mAbs and bispecific antibodies with increased potency and reduced immunogenicity. One of the major breakthroughs was the invention of phage display which revolutionised the field of antibody engineering with its robust, easy to use and highly versatile combinatorial display platform. Its successful applications include: generation of antibodies with unique functions from immune and non-immune sources, de novo isolation of high affinity binders from non-immune or synthetic sources and the in vitro affinity maturation of antibodies [43] . Phage based selection could be summarised as the display of antibodies (proteins or peptides) on the surface of bacteriophage by fusing the antibody gene to one of the phage coat proteins and selection based on the antigen binding of individual clones. Phage antibody libraries are constructed by PCR based cloning of VH and VL repertoires by random pairing into a phage or phagemid vector system and display on the surface of bacteriophage. It has been used widely in the antibody engineering as a technique to mimic B cells, which are self-replicating packaged systems containing antibody genes that encode the antibody displayed on its surface (linked genotype and phenotype) [108] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 417, "end": 421, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1129, "end": 1133, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1815, "end": 1820, "text": "[108]", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Monoclonal Antibody Generation Technologies"}, {"text": "Phage display libraries can be constructed using antibody variable (v) genes isolated from IgM mRNA of non-immunised human donor B cells derived from diverse lymphoid sources such as peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), spleen cells, tonsils, bone marrow or from nonimmunised animal B cells (na\u00efve antibody libraries). IgG mRNA from PBLs or spleen cells of immunised animals or human patients are used to build immunised libraries. A third class called synthetic and semi-synthetic antibody libraries are constructed using repertoires of rearranged V genes from gene segments using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and introducing variation into their CDR regions using custom degenerate primers encoding for diversity and length [108] . Immunised libraries are generally constructed using antibody VH and VL genes amplified from the mRNA of B cell pools from immunised animals or human donors. Post immunisation, the antibody secreting B cells possess a higher percentage of antigen specific heavy and light chain gene transcripts. These B cells would have undergone affinity maturation and isotype switching in germinal centres before entering into the peripheral circulation. Typically antibodies isolated from immunised libraries will have a high affinity and tighter specificity for the immunogens used [8] and can be achieved even from relatively small library diversity [108] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 729, "end": 734, "text": "[108]", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 1307, "end": 1310, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1376, "end": 1381, "text": "[108]", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Phage Display Antibody Libraries"}, {"text": "Unlike hybridoma technology, phage display provides researchers with more possibilities to streamlining their monoclonal antibody generation process. The main improvement is the replacement of cell culture screening steps using hybridomas. Instead of screening hundreds or thousands of hybridoma monoclonals to find positive clones, phage display, with carefully designed panning strategies, can screen billions of clones and allow the enrichment of small subsets of binders with desirable characteristics that can be further screened to identify individual binders. Antibodies recognising specific antigenic conformations and epitopes can be easily isolated by introducing selective or subtractive panning steps during the selection process. It has also been reported that using phage display high specificity antibodies can be isolated from immunised sources which would be missed by traditional immunological methods [100] . A key feature of this system is the linkage of genotype (phagemid vector) and phenotype (phage coat protein-antibody fragment) which allows immediate access to the corresponding gene sequences of selected antibodies facilitating simple sub-cloning into various antibody formats based on required downstream applications ( Fig. 6.1 ). Over the last 20 years phage display technologies have been successfully used for the development of many therapeutic antibody candidates and approved drugs and with the relaxation of commercial restrictions more and more products are now entering the diagnostic and research markets as well [9] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 920, "end": 925, "text": "[100]", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 1554, "end": 1557, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1250, "end": 1258, "text": "Fig. 6.1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Phage Display Antibody Libraries"}, {"text": "The drawbacks of animal immunisation for the construction of phage display libraries include the time period required for the completion of such a process and the requirement to construct separate libraries for each antigen. However, by combining the power of immunisation with phage display, several high affinity monoclonal antibodies against \"difficult\" antigenic targets have been isolated from relative small antibody libraries and where traditional approaches have failed [33, 98] . Generating antibodies against self or toxic antigens is limited if immunisation is to be employed. In particular, human autoantigens are highly conserved amongst most routinely used laboratory mammals such as mice or rat. Therefore immunisation of non-mammals such as sharks and chickens, which are phylogenetically distant from humans, has been successfully employed for generating an immune response and antibodies and/or antibody like binders (VNAR) to epitopes conserved in mammalian species [42] . Chickens are phylogenetically distant from humans and therefore very successful in generating an immune response to mammalian proteins which are highly conserved [34] , while sharks are even more distant from humans, diverging from a common ancestor approximately 450 million years ago [6, 37, 53] . [13, 14, 54, 66, 76, 89, 111, 112] . Human monoclonal antibodies from patients which showed protective effects in animal model studies have also been selected against bacterial targets such as anthrax toxins [107] , botulinum neurotoxin [4] and the ABC transporter of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus [12] . In the case of the West Nile Virus neutralising mAbs were only isolated from the B cell population of convalescent human patients with large phage display libraries constructed from uninfected donors delivering nothing of consequence [105] . Conventional methods of antibody generation such as hybridoma and Epstein-Barr virus transformation are limited in their abilities to evaluate human monoclonal antibodies from different patients at various stages of their clinical course. Technologies like phage display provide a powerful tool that allows pooling of large number of patient immune B cell populations and the selecting of antibodies with distinct specificities and inhibitory activities during different stages of infection [13] . The ability to improve affinities and broaden specificities post selection is a major attribute of recombinant antibodies. Using recombinant DNA and protein engineering approaches the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties of these molecules can be improved including half-life extension and reduced immunogenicity. For the neutralisation of toxins and viruses, it is often advantageous to generate multiple high affinity antibodies that recognise different epitopes on the same antigen or a variety of antigenic subtypes capable of delivering broad protection against pathogen variants. Such 'oligoclonal' antibodies were reported to show strong synergistic activity in neutralising botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) assays [74] .

With the ever increasing numbers of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains, the need to develop antibody based drugs with novel modes of killing has never been greater especially if their mode of action limits the development of resistance. Antibodies developed against bacterial targets fall into two main categories: (i) antibodies that target the bacterial cell surface directly or (ii) those that act indirectly by neutralising bacterial toxins or virulence factors and relying on the host immune system for effective pathogen clearance.

A number of Gram negative bacteria, including pathogens like P. aeruginosa, utilise homoserine lactones (HSLs) as QS signalling compounds and engage in cell-to-cell communication to coordinate their behaviour. As QS takes a central role in P. aeruginosa infection by regulating the expression of extracellular virulence factors (and also [12] biofilm formation), immuno-modulation of the HSL molecules by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be used as a novel approach to prevent P. aeruginosa infections. Sheep immunisation was utilised to develop antibodies with high affinity and sensitivity towards HSL compounds. A mixture of three HSLs-N-acyl-C12-HSL, 3-oxo-C12-HSL and 3-OH-C12-HSL with different subgroups at the third carbon position were conjugated to the carrier protein Thyroglobulin (TG) and used as immunogen to enhance the chance of eliciting an antibody response in sheep.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 182, "end": 186, "text": "[78]", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 527, "end": 531, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Blocking Quorum Sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa"}, {"text": "Using PBLs from immunised sheep as starting material, V H -V \u03bb and V H -V \u03ba anti-HSL phage display libraries were constructed in a scFv format. The panning strategy was designed to drive selection towards the enrichment of high sensitivity and cross-reactivity clones. Lead clones were reformatted into sheep-mouse chimeric IgGs and had picomolar sensitivities (IC 50 values as determined by competition ELISA) for 3-oxo-C12-HSL which is the central QS compound in P. aeruginosa. These values are quite impressive, considering the chemical nature of these lipidlike compounds (average molecular weight 300 Da) which possess only a small head like structure and lack critical antigenic features such as aromaticity or charge. Modelling of these sensitive anti-HSL antibodies indicated that the level of sensitivity observed was achieved through the generation of a deep and negatively charged binding pocket [2] . Sheep immunisation was chosen for this HSL application as this approach has previously been shown to generate high affinity antibodies against haptenic targets [17] and sheep polyclonal antibodies have been used as specific high affinity immunologic probes for analytical and clinical purposes for many years [62] . In contrast to humans and mice, sheep B cell lymphopoiesis occurs predominantly in the ileal Peyer's patches (IPP) and V(D)J recombination creates limited diversity in the sheep Ig repertoire due to a very few gene segments participating in the rearrangement process. This characteristic feature makes sheep library construction simpler, as the entire heavy and light chain gene repertoire can be amplified using a small number of primers. Much of the antibody diversity is achieved through antigen-independent post-rearrangement somatic hypermutation, which diversifies all CDRs as compared to the sole variability of just CDR3 in humans and mice [17, 62, 78, 84] . Comparison of chicken and sheep responses by hyperimmunisation with the same immunogen revealed the ability of the sheep immune system to produce higher specificity antibodies than chicken [109] . The overall antibody titre was also much higher in sheep and might be due to the longer half-life (~15 days) of sheep immunoglobulins when compared to 35 h in chicken [106, 109] .

Furthermore, in a non-neutropenic lung model of mice infected with P. aeruginosa PA058, HSL mAb monotherapy demonstrated significant efficacy, prolonging survival by up to 83%. Since no significant reduction in bacterial counts was observed in the lungs of infected mice, it is proposed that HSL specific antibodies protect mice possibly through antibody mediated scavenging of HSL compounds.

Pathogenesis is driven by the secretion of potent toxins that utilise ADP-ribosylation as the catalytic mechanism underlying their action. ADP-ribosylating toxins comprise a large family, and all produce disease by altering key metabolic processes after transfer of an ADPribose moiety from NAD to specific host-cell target proteins [25, 60] . It was not until the early 2000 that the ADP-ribosylating enzyme was implicated in intracellular pathogenesis. It was shown that Salmonella strains were capable of invading epithelial cells and localising in macrophages during infection [60, 61] . The Salmonella virulence plasmid factor B (spvB) virulence gene of Salmonella is required for human macrophage cytotoxicity in vitro and for enhancing intracellular bacterial proliferation during infection. Lesnick et al. provided evidence that spvB encodes an ADP-ribosylating enzyme that uses actin as a substrate and depolymerises actin filaments when expressed in CHO cells [61] . A spvB blocking camel VHH single domain antibody (sdAb) capable of blocking spvB enzymatic activity at a 1:1 molar ratio was isolated from an immune phage display library generated from an spvB immunised llama [3, 68] . As an intracellular protein, spvB is inaccessible to conventional antibodies, and small molecule inhibitors of spvB are fraught with potential side effects resulting from the indiscriminate inhibition of endogenous mammalian ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs) [11, 51, 63] . The VHH sdAb when expressed as an intrabody, effectively protected cells from the cytotoxic activity of a translocation-competent chimeric C21N-C/spvB toxin, and transfected cells were also protected against cytoskeletal alterations induced by wild-type spvB-expressing strains of Salmonella [3] .

In another study a mAb generated through mice immunisation and hybridoma technology was engineered using phage-display as a scFv fragment and showed high affinity binding to an H. pylori surface antigen.

Due to their high specificity and target selectivity, antifungal antibodies can be successfully employed for targeted killing of fungal pathogens without harming host cells. Using hybridoma technology several mAbs were generated against various antigenic components of fungal pathogens Cryptooccus neoformans, Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Pneumocystis jerovecii and Histoplasma capsulatum [19, 36, 40, 70, 82, 85, 87] .

However it is the opinion of the authors that the debate regarding animal use for research purposes should be substantially assessed on the basis of a risk-benefit analysis and suitability.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 246, "end": 250, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Antibacterial properties of Pseudomonas aeruginosa immunotype 1 lipopolysaccharidespecific monoclonal antibody (MAb) in a murine thigh infection model: combined effects of MAb and ceftazidime", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Akiyama", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Oishi", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Tao", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Matsumoto", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Pollack", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2000, "venue": "Microbiol Immunol", "volume": "44", "issn": "8", "pages": "629--635", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Defining the complementarities between antibodies and haptens to refine our understanding and aid the prediction of a successful binding interaction", "authors": [{"first": "Al", "middle": [], "last": "Qaraghuli", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Palliyil", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Broadbent", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": [], "last": "Cullen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Charlton", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Porter", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["J"], "last": "", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2015, "venue": "BMC Biotechnol", "volume": "15", "issn": "1", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Single-domain llama antibodies as specific intracellular inhibitors of SpvB, the actin ADP-ribosylating toxin of Salmonella typhimurium", "authors": [{"first": "V", "middle": [], "last": "Alzogaray", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "W", "middle": [], "last": "Danquah", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Aguirre", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Urrutia", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": [], "last": "Berguer", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": ["G"], "last": "V\u00e9scovi", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "F", "middle": [], "last": "Haag", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "F", "middle": [], "last": "Koch-Nolte", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "F", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Goldbaum", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2011, "venue": "FASEB J", "volume": "25", "issn": "2", "pages": "526--534", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Genetic and immunological comparison of anti-botulinum type A antibodies from immune and non-immune human phage libraries", "authors": [{"first": "P", "middle": [], "last": "Amersdorfer", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Wong", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "T", "middle": [], "last": "Smith", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Chen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Deshpande", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": [], "last": "Sheridan", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["D"], "last": "Marks", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2002, "venue": "Vaccine", "volume": "20", "issn": "11", "pages": "1640--1648", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "In vivo neutralization of botulinum neurotoxins serotype E with heavy-chain camelid antibodies (VHH)", "authors": [{"first": "H", "middle": [], "last": "Bakherad", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Slm", "middle": [], "last": "Gargari", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "I", "middle": [], "last": "Rasooli", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Rajabibazl", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Mohammadi", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "W", "middle": [], "last": "Ebrahimizadeh", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "L", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Ardakani", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "H", "middle": [], "last": "Zare", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2013, "venue": "Mol Biotechnol", "volume": "55", "issn": "2", "pages": "159--167", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF5": {"ref_id": "b5", "title": "Shark novel antigen receptors-the next generation of biologic therapeutics?
