(2019) have shown that young adults in a range between 18 and 35 years old tend to have a high and growing prevalence of sleep problems, and young adults make extensive use of social media devices that interact with daily activities, including sleep (Gradisar et al., 2013; Orzech, Grandner, Roane, & Carskadon, 2016) . Social media platforms offer an opportunity to ameliorate social isolation, but the use of digital media near bedtime could have a broadly negative effect on sleep outcomes of young adults (Orzech et al., 2016) .",
