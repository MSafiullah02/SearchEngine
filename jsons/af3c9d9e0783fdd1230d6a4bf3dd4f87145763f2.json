In general, they are composed of 10-20 sugar rings connected in a tree like structure to the 41 corresponding asparagine (Asn/N) residue ( Figure 1E ). The inherent heterogeneity of surface exposed glycans hinders 42 crystallization, therefore single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) offers a more versatile solution for 43 structural analysis. Thus, the first structures of the fully glycosylated soluble SOSIP, as well as transmembrane derived 44 HIV-1 Env trimers were solved with cryo-EM [12,13]. In these reconstructions, most glycans were not resolved beyond 45 the first or second sugar ring except when stabilized by antibodies, indicating the glycan shield is highly dynamic. This 46 lack of immediately discernable structural features did not inspire closer analysis and structural studies remained 47 focused on Env-antibody interactions and epitope mapping, while experimental investigations into the glycan shield 48 shifted primarily towards chemical analysis via mass-spectrometry (MS) [11].

Unfortunately, low signal to noise ratios in the raw projection images limit their 57 interpretability and necessitates averaging to recover high-resolution features. This procedure boosts signal and 58 flattens noise in regions of high spatial homogeneity but causes blurring around flexible domains. Despite this, 59 heterogeneity can often be reduced to obtain higher resolution reconstructions or studied directly through 60 classification and other more sophisticated algorithms [14][15] [16] . In general, these algorithms work best when 61 heterogeneity is discrete, and/or the variability exists between a few large structured domains. Surface exposed 62 glycans on the other hand, are both small (compared to larger protein domains) and their fluctuations are continuous 63 in nature.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been particularly useful as a complementary approach for 70 characterizing glycoprotein structure and dynamics[26-29], including HIV Env[6,30-32]. Three sets of atomistic 71 dynamics simulations of fully glycosylated Env trimers were recently reported and these predicted that 72 conformational dynamics would lead to extensive shielding of antigenic surface and the formation of complicated 73 networks among interacting glycans[6,31,32]. Although highly informative, MD simulations for systems as large as this 74 require substantial computational resources to access biologically relevant spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, the 75 development of more computationally efficient methods for modeling fully glycosylated Env is needed. In spite of 76 advances in modeling the glycosylated proteins however, there is still no established methodology for validating the 77 theoretical predictions with experimental data.",

In parallel, we developed a high-throughput modeling 82 pipeline for rapidly generating diverse ensembles of fully glycosylated Env models at atomistic resolution, enabling 83 quantification of glycan-specific geometric properties and concerted behavior within the glycan shield as a whole. We 84 then used these ensembles as ground-truth for the creation of synthetic cryo-EM datasets, which facilitated the 85 development of new analysis tools and enabled the validation of theoretical models against cryo-EM experiments.",

Also, it is currently in the first ever human clinical trials of a trimeric 103 4 subunit-based HIV vaccine (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03699241). In Figure 1 we present a cryo-EM 104 reconstruction of BG505 SOSIP.664 expressed and purified from HEK293F cells in complex with three copies of the 105 non-neutralizing fragment antigen binding domain (Fab) derived from the antibody RM20A3, which was included to 106 improve orientation bias (as illustrated by the 3-dimensioinal (3-D) angular distribution histogram - Figure 1F ). This 107 complex will be referred to as BG505_293F from here on. In addition, RM20A3 binds to the base of the SOSIP at a 108 neo-epitope only accessible on the soluble trimer ( Figure 1B ) that is devoid of glycans ( Figure 1D ). This leaves the 109 native glycan shield unperturbed, making the SOSIP/base-Fab complex ideal for this study. 110 111 Conventional cryo-EM analysis confirms the glycan shield is highly dynamic and that dynamics vary among glycans 112 Cryo-EM maps contain structural information that varies across both resolution and intensity scales. Yet the typical 113 workflow involves isolating just a single point within this scale-space for interpretation and model building. Usually, a 114 map is filtered to the reported global resolution, then sharpened to enhance the highest-resolution features.

Env has one of the highest densities of N-linked glycosylation sites known, with 32 ~1/21 extracellular residues being glycosylated, accounting for ~1/2 the mass of the molecule [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] .

The surface 116 constructed from this thresholded map is called an isosurface. This way of viewing and interpreting cryo-EM 117 reconstructions is well suited for the typical goals of structural biology, but when the reconstruction contains 118 variations in resolution and intensity, as is often the case for flexible and dynamic molecules and molecular complexes, 119 a single map processed in this manner is of limited value.",

The global resolution of this C3-symmetric reconstruction determined by Fourier shell correlation 122 (FSC) was ~3.1\u00c5 (Supplemental Figure 1 ). The bulk of the Env protein structure is at or below the global resolution 123 ( Figure 1C ) and ~80% of the Env amino acid (aa) residues could be confidently built into this map, with missing residues 124 occurring around the flexible variable loops 1, 2, 4, and 5, the HR1 helix, and the N and C-termini. Most of the N-linked 125 glycans (colored green) on the other hand, are ill-defined beyond the core N-acetylglucosamine (NAG), and we can 126 only account for ~15% of the total glycan mass in this sharpened map ( Figure 1D ). Glycans located on the poorly 127 resolved flexible loops (N185e, N185h, N339, N398, N406, N411, N462) could not be identified at all, however MS 128 analysis confirms that all the potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGS) predicted from the sequence are indeed 129 glycosylated[35] (Supplemental Figure 12A ). This indicates that the glycan shield is highly dynamic with respect to the 130 protein core but exhibits some relative differences in ordering between glycans. In a later section, we show how to 131 quantify these differences more precisely. At a low threshold ( Figure 1C ), noise appears surrounding Env's well 132 resolved protein core where the missing glycan mass should be, however it is not apparent if there exists any 133 meaningful structure within this noise.",

A connected component is any connected and isolated group of 'on' voxels in a binary volume 140 or isosurface. In the language of topology, the number of connected components defines the 0th Betti number of the 141 map at that threshold [36] . When the log of this number is plotted as a function of intensity for the series of filtered 142 maps shown in Figure 2A we see the same general trend ( Figure 2B and Supplemental Figure 7C ). The initial rise-and-143 fall corresponds to high-intensity features emerging, growing, and merging, while the second sharp peak corresponds 144 to low-intensity noise.

We replicated the scale-space 233 analysis from Figure 2C on the simulated maps and observed a similar trend, with the plateau again appearing around 234 1.5-2 SD (Supplemental Figure 7A -B). In fact, the volume of the 1.5 SD map contoured at its noise threshold closely 235 approximates the total sampled volume measured directly from the atomic models (dashed line). When comparing 236 BG505_Man9 to the curves produced from the BG505_Man5 and BG505_PO reconstructions, the additional glycan 237 volume recovered by the filtering and thresholding process is apparent, indicating cryo-EM can detect global changes 238 in glycosylation between reconstructions. After filtering, we observed a similar threshold-dependent evolution 239 towards a more connected topology ( Figure 4C ), where at the lowest thresholds the majority of the protein surface is 240 occluded, and the glycan shield is completely interconnected. We even replicated the SPARX 3-D variability analysis 241 on the simulated Man9 dataset and observed very similar results (Supplemental Figure 8A ). By comparing the SPARX 8 method to the true per-voxel 3-D variance calculated without projection and refinement, we confirmed there is 243 negligible difference between the two (Supplemental Figure 8B ).

Similar behavior was previously 488 observed via MS by comparing glycoform distributions before and after knocking out a particular glycan[46-48]. Such 489 higher-order effects on glycan processing and dynamics can be easily explained by our structural and computational 490 findings. Beyond the detection of changes in glycosylation, we found that glycan dynamics measured by local intensity 491 in the cryo-EM maps is strongly correlated with the extent of glycan processing measured by the percentage of high-492 mannose type glycans at each site (Supplemental Figure 12B-C) .

We found that glycan flexibility deviated from the experimental observations when the dynamics of the 502 underlying protein are greater than can be captured by the current pipeline. Thus, exploring solutions for enhanced 503 sampling of the protein backbone represents a clear route for improving accuracy of the pipeline. Another logical next 504 step is to use the experimental cryo-EM maps to steer the glycan modeling process, which has been successful at the 505 level of protein ensembles[21,49,50]. On the experimental side, our ability to accurately capture differences in glycan 506 dynamics from cryo-EM maps is limited by additional uncertainties that we did not quantify in this paper and could 507 therefore be contributing to the observed deviations. Improving upon the cryo-EM methodology will be equally as Figure 6E ). Transient deflections of neighboring glycans away from a site can temporarily 519 expose it to digestion, but the probability of this occurring will be influenced by the local density and the dynamics of 520 the surrounding glycans. As the peripheral glycans were digested away it revealed a core set of highly connected glycan sub-domains which showed close resemblance to the sub-graphs generated by defining a more stringent 522 overlap cutoff within the network. Although a direct comparison between our probabilistic network model and the 523 networks constructed from the MD simulations[31,32] would not be entirely accurate, we found they show a similar 524 overall structure.

One potential mechanism is stabilizing interactions between the core NAG and neighboring 533 side chains, which are observed throughout Env and are common in other glycoproteins. However, Endo H leaves the 534 core NAG attached, so the stability must arise by another mechanism. We hypothesize that the dense packing of 535 glycans serves to dampen the underlying protein dynamics. In line with this, we observed an increase in glycan RMSF 536 when using Man5 in place of the larger Man9, which we interpret as more crowding in the glycan canopy (above the 537 stalks) leading to reduced dynamics closer to the protein surface. Furthermore, the correlation we observed between 538 Endo H protection and network eigencentrality suggests glycan-glycan interactions might also play a role.

Since samples produced in HEK293S are only high mannose, and were treated only with PNGase F, sites 589 with N+3 were identified as sites with high mannose. ",

The process was performed before and after resampling and intensity equalization, also with the Fabs masked out to better capture the relevant signal (Supplemental Figure 7) . The mask 662 used to delete the Fab here and for difference mapping has been deposited to the EMDB with the BG505_293F map. Figure 9B ). The cumulative absolute 691 deviation from the mean across all glycans was calculated for each individual glycan residue, which suggested the 692 BMA residue closely approximates the full-glycan RMSF (Supplemental Figure 9A) . The correlation analysis was 693 repeated using each of the 11 individual glycan residues in place of the average and we saw negligible differences 694 (Supplemental Figure 9C ). This same model was used to analyze the BG505_CHO data, while minor adjustments to 695 the N611 glycan were made to for the BG505_293S map. This same procedure was used to analyze all the simulated 21 cryo-EM maps. To quantify the percent occupancy at each site after Endo H digestion we assumed a linear relationship 697 between signal intensity and occupancy, with any intensity <= 0 being considered fully digested. Initial occupancies 698 were determined by MS. To calculate the Endo H protection score we added the percent occupancy at each site from 699 the EndoH2 and EndoH16 maps and normalized the results between 0 and 1. This can be seen as the integral of 700 occupancy with respect to reaction time. All local intensity analysis was repeated before and after intensity 701 equalization in RELION for comparison (Supplemental Figure 10) . ",

Our results support the previous conclusions from cryo-EM experiments that 449 the native glycan shield is highly dynamic with respect to the protein core. We did not observe stabilized glycan-glycan450 interactions like those reported in crystal structures of the same clone[6]. In contrast, we only observed diffuse higher-451 14 order structure at low resolutions, indicative of averaging over a large ensemble of heterogenous conformations. The 452 topology of this ensemble-average structure is highly connected; however, this does not prove glycans engage in 453 specific interactions, only that they sample overlapping volumes and can potentially interact. There were several 454 methodological differences between the crystallography and our cryo-EM studies that could contribute to the 455 apparently contradictory results. For example, the crystal structures included two bound bnAb per monomer to 456 facilitate crystal packing, both of which engage multiple glycans and disrupt the native dynamics and higher-order 457 structure. Desolvation of mobile waters embedded within the glycan shield during crystallization could also potentially 458 induce the stabilized glycan-glycan contacts observed. A favorable interpretation is that the crystal structures capture 459 physiologically relevant interactions and conformations, however artificially stabilized. This interpretation would fit 460 within the conclusions of this paper as well as the results of previous atomistic simulations [6,31,32], which show that 461glycans can interact with one another, however more dynamically than the crystal structures suggest.",

This methodology accounts for both energetic and spatial 177 constraints on glycan sampling by a combination of empirical energy minimization and simulated annealing (described 178 in detail by Guttman et al. [39]). Here, we have built on this by integrating a stereochemical check on the protein 179 backbone as an intermediate step for rigorous selection of the underlying scaffold and utilized it to generate much 180 larger ensembles of 1000 fully glycosylated Env structures",

            "text": "The ensemble for each model contains 1000 snapshots, making M = 1000 snapshots for each of the two models. The739 standard deviations (s.d.) were obtained by dividing the 1000 snapshots into 4 sets of M=250, and calculating the 740 square root of the variations from the four sets of RMSF values. The single-model average RMSF was similarly 741 calculated, where M reduces to 100. The value obtained for each of the 10 models were averaged to get the final permodel RMSF value. For calculating the sampled volumes, volumetric surface maps were created for each individual 743 glycan using the volmap plugin of VMD[92] (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/), including all 1000 models, with 1\u00c5 grid size. The enclosed volume of these generated surface models was calculated using UCSF CHIMERA [78] 745 (http://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimera).Graph theoretic analysis of ALLOSMOD ensemblesThe inter-glycan overlap is calculated as the total fraction of heavy atoms from the two glycans that come within 5\u00c5 of each other. A single mannose-9 glycan has 127 heavy atoms. Since our ensemble is composed of 1000 possible 750 structures, there are effectively 127,000 heavy atoms per ensemble of mannose-9 at one position. The fraction of the 751 total number of heavy atoms from two neighboring ensembles that come within contact distance defines the overlap 752 fraction. An overlap greater than or equal to 50% of heavy atoms from two neighboring mannose-9 glycans is assigned 753 as 1. This overlap matrix is used to define the adjacency matrix for our network analysis. Each glycan functions as a node of the graph, and two nodes are connected by an edge if there is at least 5% overlap as per our overlap definition 755 given above. The edge length is inversely proportional to the overlap value, i.e., the larger the overlap, the closer two nodes (glycans) are in the graph. Only those glycans from the neighboring protomers are considered, that have an inter-protomer edge. All graph theory and network-based analysis were performed using Python {Python Software Foundation, https://www.python.org/} and Matlab_R2018a packages.Simulated cryo-EM data creation and processing from ALLOSMOD ensemblesFirst, each model generated from the HT-AM pipeline was converted into mrc volume file with the same box and pixel sizes as the experimental data (in this case we used the lower magnification from the Talos Arctica of 1.15\u00c5/pixel) using the EMAN2[93] function e2pdb2mrc, with the max resolution set as twice the voxel size. Next, each volume was projected at 100 uniformly distributed angles, either with or without white noise, using the RELION function relion_project. All 1000 particles.star files were then combined (100K total projections) and refinement was initiated using the BG505_293F map with Fabs removed as an initial model. In all cases the resolution converged around the Nyquist frequency (2.3\u00c5), and the final maps were sharpened using a data-derived B-factor and soft mask in RELION.",
