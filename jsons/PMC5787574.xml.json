The value of statistical information for improving health policies is thoroughly discussed in Egidi and Buratta (2006). Our aim is to show the more relevant sources for evaluating health, morbidity and mortality at the individual level. Many references are given to the Nordic countries, as their data sources are among the best available, but the present paper also refers to a variety of innovative data sources and analyses in other European countries and abroad. As pointed out below, no attempt is made to cover the developed countries exhaustively. The review is based on papers published in demography, epidemiology, and public health and on information drawn from the websites of the organisations collecting the data. The paper is primarily focused on routinely collected information covering a whole country or a major part of a country, in contrast to surveys for specific populations such as physician surveys. No attempt is made to draw up an inventory of sources by country; this would indeed be a useful future research project. The paper deals instead with the pros and cons of each source for mortality and morbidity studies in demography. Data sources for evaluating healthcare performance and costs\u2014such as in the EuroHOPE project\u2014lie outside the scope of this paper, though these are of course crucial issues.",

While each source has its own advantages and problems, some problems are common to a large majority of sources, such as population selection and representativeness, non-response and inadequate reporting, privacy rights and related ethical issues, cost of large operations and cross-country comparability. Specific issues will be pointed out for each source. As stated in the conclusion, each source considered separately can already yield useful, though partial, results that can be used for research purposes and for informing health policies. Record linkage among data sources can significantly improve the analysis even further. Record linkage can also lead to the detection of possible causal associations that could eventually be confirmed. More generally, Big Data can reveal changing mortality and morbidity trends and patterns that could lead to preventive measures being taken rather than more costly curative ones.",

(2017) point out, it is continuity, completeness and relevance at local administrative levels that distinguish civil registration and vital statistics information from other population data sources. Statistics on causes of death, used to measure the relative contributions of various diseases on mortality, are based on the death certificate delivered by a medical doctor. For an overview of the data production process and the main types of possible analyses see, e.g. Rey (2016). In the cases where the patient dies at the hospital or the doctor certifying the death is the patient\u2019s general practitioner (GP), the information on the cause of death is supposed to be reliable. However, and especially for the GPs, the question is raised about their training in terms of knowing how to fill in the medical certificate and their interest in doing so (McAllum et al. 2005). As an example of a special training programme addressed to students of medicine in their last year, family doctors and interns, with the objective of improving professional competence regarding the certification of causes of death according to the international regulations of the World Health Organisation (WHO), see Alonso-Sard\u00f3n et al. (2015).",

This certificate was proposed in 1977 (at the time of the International Classification of Diseases ICD-9) in order to ensure a better comparability of the statistics on this subject between countries. Causes of death should now be coded following the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (presently ICD-10), see Mesl\u00e9 (2006) for a comprehensive overview. The certificate is set out in two parts. The first part is designed to retrace the process which has led to death. The starting point is the immediate, or direct, cause of death (line 1). Then successive lines invite going back through the sequences that led to death, the last line of part 1 providing the underlying cause of death, and the lines between the first and the last delivering the intermediate cause(s). Part 2 of the death certificate is devoted to condition(s) which could have contributed to death but are not part of the main causal sequence leading to death. Finally, on the right-hand side of the certificate, a column allows stating the approximate time interval between the onset of each condition and death, in order to verify the coherence of the description of the process.",

Using the WHO classification in force (currently, ICD-10\u2014an ICD-11 is in its final phase and is planned for implementation in 2018), the reported conditions are translated into medical codes. WHO (1992b) has formulated selection and modification rules in order to improve the reliability of mortality statistics and to allow selecting a single cause of death, the underlying cause, from a reported sequence of conditions. All morbid conditions, diseases and injuries entered on the death certificate represent the multiple causes of death (see \u2018Using data on multiple causes of death\u2019 section below).",

The user enters ICD-10 codes corresponding to the conditions reported on the death certificates. Iris then selects the underlying cause (IRIS Institute Website, http://www.dimdi.de). One can point out the pioneering role of the USA in implementing automatic coding, with the National Center for Health Statistics\u2019 development in the late 1960s of the ACME computer system for standardising the production of mortality statistics.",

There are presently 20 chapters of causes in ICD-10. The underlying cause of death can be used to analyse mortality differences between populations or over time. For example, racial differences in life expectancy in the USA can be \u2018explained\u2019 by the differences in the leading causes of death between the white and the black populations (Kochanek et al. 2013).

            "text": "Several attempts have been made to bridge different ICDs by the reclassification of causes according to one of the ICD revisions. Probably, the best known of these attempts are those by France Mesl\u00e9 and Jacques Vallin, with various collaborators, at the INED in Paris (see, e.g. Mesl\u00e9 and Vallin 1996). The registration of causes of death is not without problems, however, and these can hamper comparisons over time and across countries, as when using the WHO Mortality Database on mortality by age, sex and cause of death. First, one can point out the successive revisions of the ICD and the problem of bridging between two ICDs. For example, if one compares ICD-10 to ICD-9, ICD-10 not only increases the classification details (and shifts from a numerical to an alphanumerical classification system) but also includes \u2018changes in the coding rules by which a single cause of death is selected from among the multiple causes reported by physicians as causing or contributing to the death\u2019 (http://cancerprofiles.ca). Secondly, changes in the reports of causes of death may also be due to the use of new diagnostic techniques allowing a more efficient detection of diseases, to changes in the concept of diseases, and the appearance of new diseases such as HIV. Thirdly, training of MDs for the certification of causes of death can vary greatly among countries. In addition to the diagnostic accuracy issue, MDs only report diseases or conditions that they judge relevant for causing the death. According to WHO, the rate of ill-defined causes per 100,000 people, at ages 0 to 64, varied from 0.44 (Malta) to 22.51 (Portugal) for the EU population (European Health Information Gateway, 2012 data). In addition, age misreporting can sometimes be a problem for some population groups, such as immigrants. Finally, even among developed countries, the coverage of the cause-of-death statistics can vary across countries and over time. For example, according to recent estimates, the coverage was estimated for Cyprus at 78% in 1997 and at 86% in 2011, while it was 100% at both dates in Sweden (World Health Organization, Global Health Observatory Data Repository/World Health Statistics). And one should also point out the difficulty, as with all classifications, in reaching univocal solutions in the ICD.",

One can, for example, study hypertension-related deaths by taking into account any mention of hypertension on the death certificate, using multiple cause-of-death data. Though useful for determining associations among causes of death, causal sequences and patterns of diseases (see for instance Redelings et al. 2007), contributory causes of death are however rarely considered in the tabulation of mortality statistics, though death is often the result of a combination of causes, especially at older ages. In their book Recent Trends in Mortality Analysis, Manton and Stallard (1984) were among the first to thoroughly examine the use of multiple-cause mortality data in the context of medical demography. In particular, they examined pattern-of-failure representations of mortality, i.e. combinations or joint occurrences of causes of death found on the death certificates, and showed the advantages of this approach compared to the sole use of the underlying cause of death.",

The authors also took up, to give an example among others, the issue of analysing multiple causes of death (MCOD), with an application to cancer-related mortality in France and Italy. After studying the quality of the data on multiple causes of death, the authors present various indicators for analysing MCOD data. Using French and Italian data, they examine the most frequent associations of causes of death with cancer, the latter being reported either as the underlying cause of death or as a contributing cause. Five patterns of associations are distinguished in the present case. The authors conclude by stressing the interesting fact that the multiple-causes-of-death approach \u2018can help to identify associations which, though not currently validated by medical knowledge, should be taken seriously and investigated further\u2019 (p. 488). D\u00e9sesquelles et al. (2014) also used the multiple-cause-of-death approach to compare mortality from Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementias in France and Italy, pointing out inter alia possible dissimilarities of reporting practices. Though the multiple-cause-of-death approach can be recommended, the number of contributory causes reported on the death certificate varies from country to country, hampering to some extent international comparisons.

As mentioned above, according to WHO, the underlying cause of death consists in the present case of \u2018the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury\u2019 (WHO 1992a, p. 1235).

            "text": "External cause-of-death registration is not without its problems, however. For example, an international study from 2000 onwards has shown that out of 83 countries having cause-of-death registration, only 20 countries had high-quality death registration data that could be used for estimating injury mortality, because elsewhere, injury deaths were frequently classified using imprecise, partially specified categories (Bhalla et al. 2010). Furthermore, it is well known that some types of external causes are difficult to evaluate. For example, suicides are often underreported, especially in countries where suicides are not morally or socially accepted (T\u00f8llefsen et al. 2012). It is also difficult in many cases to determine the intent of the death: intentional self-harm, or homicide or accident\u2026? Such is the case, for example, of single-vehicle accidents and drownings. To take another example, a death from a vehicle accident might occur not on the scene but some hours or days after the accident. What lapse of time after the accident should one choose after which the death will no longer be determined as resulting from that accident? This criterion varies between countries, from \u2018died on the scene\u2019 to \u2018unlimited\u2019, biasing international comparisons. WHO uses a 30-day time limit in its publications, adjusting, when possible, the data provided by national sources. Consider another case: that of pedestrian fatalities. There are several definitions of who is a pedestrian, and how pedestrians are defined has an effect on the number of deaths that are counted as pedestrian deaths (see Noland et al. 2017).",

Thanks to this, one can detect for example clusters of incident cases (such as a food-borne infection due to Listeria) and locate their source,5 or observe multiple cases of a particular communicable disease in different countries and trace them back to common international travel on the part of the individuals concerned.

Diagnostic means have also evolved over time. Furthermore, as discussed above, completeness of registration remains a problem if one cannot cross-check the cancer register with other sources using record linkage. Notification must be legally mandatory, and reminders should be sent to sources which do not fully comply. The diagnostic information should be based on a histological examination by a pathologist. In Denmark, the proportion of morphologically verified tumours reaches 89%. Although already very high by international standards, this proportion could nevertheless still be increased (Gjerstorff 2011).",

For a discussion of developments in census-taking see Baffour et al. (2013). In addition, despite the standardisation and harmonisation efforts, there are limits to the comparability of census data across time and space due to changing concepts and definitions, such as that of \u2018household\u2019 (Coast et al. 2016). And the absence of census sampling errors is often offset by important non-sampling errors. Compared to carefully conducted face-to-face interviews in population samples, non-response can be high and census self-reporting can be rather poor, taking into account among other factors that it is usually up to the household head to fill in the census form for all household members.",

Health interview surveys are based on random samples; good-quality sampling is therefore a prerequisite for the representativeness of the data. Contrary to a census, the results are sample estimates of the figures for the whole population and should be accompanied by sampling error estimations. If the focus is on specific subgroups, such as the very old, it is useful to rely on (ex ante) stratified sampling with oversampling of the subpopulations with relatively fewer individuals.",

To give another example, the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) consists both of health interviews in participants\u2019 homes and standardised physical assessments in mobile examination centres.

On the one hand, non-respondents (e.g. the institutionalised) are probably in poorer health than those who respond. On the other hand, homeless persons or immigrants for example (also possibly in poorer health) may not be included in the sampling base. In Denmark, only 59.5% of the questionnaires were fully or partially completed. The response rate was lowest in the capital and highest in North Denmark. It was lower among men (particularly young men), older women, unmarried people and non-Danes (Christensen et al. 2012). In the 2008 health survey in Belgium, out of an initial sample of 14,549 households, only 5809 households actually participated in the interview (Enqu\u00eate de sant\u00e9 par interview, Belgique 2008, ISSP, Brussels). The others could not be reached or refused to take part. Does low response bias the results of a survey? Some evidence shows it does not, at least when examining the relationship between variables in a multivariate model, though response-rate bias is found for univariate distributions (Rindfuss et al. 2015). The question remains open, however. Another issue in health interview surveys is the underreporting of events related to chronic conditions. It seems that recurring events give rise to a \u2018generic memory\u2019 for the group of events, leading to a difficulty in recalling individual incidents; in time, memories lose the details and similar events tend to become melded together (Means et al. 1989).

According to the EHES website, core measurements, which all countries should at least include, are height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, total and HDL-cholesterol, fasting glucose and HbA1c (glycated haemoglobin). Once again, the problem here is a low response rate in the general population. In France, the response rate in adults was around 60% in the 2006\u20132007 survey, though a costly home-visit strategy was used, according to the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance (Institut de veille sanitaire). Unfortunately, the activities of the EHES Coordinating Centre are presently limited, due to a lack of sustainable funding.

The study concludes that, for this pathology at least, there is a weak concordance in the registration of dementia among the main health information systems and that all available health data sources should be taken into account in order to gain a global picture of the epidemiological and clinical reality of this health condition, which is particularly difficult to evaluate correctly.15",

Being able to link these various individual records together over time is therefore a priority issue, as record linkage can give the event history of this individual in the areas of health, morbidity and mortality. As longitudinal samples of individuals are difficult and costly to follow up, and as retrospective information cannot be obtained once the person has died, record linkage of individual files can provide at a rather modest cost the health trajectories of individuals in the population over their lifetime. One could, for example, examine for an individual the shift from good to ill health, then to chronic disease, disability and finally death, possibly taking into account various socio-economic characteristics of the individual (such as education and employment) and their change over time. Of course, record linkage does not yield a continuous picture of one\u2019s health situation but rather a series of shots of one\u2019s life.

The study, covering nearly 400,000 patients with SAD, showed different patterns by gender, age and geographical distribution by type of SAD. In the field of infectious diseases, the use of Big Data at the level of the individual can lead to early detection of new cases of a disease or of the emergence of a new disease, an application of query-based outlier detection in heterogeneous information networks. For example, Germany has implemented an automated outbreak detection system that monitors the routinely collected surveillance data for communicable diseases. The system detects unusually high case counts and is based on state-of-the-art statistical procedures for data mining (Salmon et al. 2016).",

Another advantage of Big Data lies in the size of the dataset\u2014the larger the size, the more power available for performing a test. In other words, a larger sample size reduces the variance of the estimate. Large samples can also yield better coverage of the population of reference and can detect subsets of data requiring more specific modelling. Methods of handling data with varying degrees of precision are improving, as are those for efficient query evaluation and probabilistic database research. For example, Marucci-Wellman et al. (2015) used Na\u00efve Bayes algorithms for semi-automated coding of short injury narratives from large administrative databases. Auto-measurement of health indicators by the individual him/herself can be taken following a standardised protocol and included in an electronic database, with feedback to the individual validated by scientific studies. For example, new technology such as the smartphone19 can be used to monitor various health characteristics and to automatically transmit this information to a central database, where medical feedback can be provided. Social media data, such as social networking sites, have been used, for example, for research on perceived risk factors of type 1 diabetes.

In all these individual fields, the mining of the Big Data collected can provide results conducive to more accurate and efficient healthcare; a series of examples of such studies is given in Herland et al. (2014). The most promising perspective, however, is to explore the data from these various sources together; integrating individual data gathered at multiple levels in view of improving diagnostics, prognostics and therapies and of producing new indications for personalised treatments. The field of translational bioinformatics is currently being developed to accomplish this (see among others Andreu-Perez et al. 2015). According to the American Medical Informatics Association, translational bioinformatics is the development of storage, analytic and interpretive methods to optimise the transformation of increasingly voluminous genomic and biomedical data into proactive, predictive, preventive and participatory health (https://www.amia.org).",

If this diverse information could be linked together, it could improve, for instance, multiple cause-of-death reporting. To give another example, mobile phone and GPS data have been used to provide information on population displacements in cases of crises, such as hurricanes (as in Haiti in 2016) or earthquakes (as in Nepal in 2015), as does the non-profit Flowminder Foundation.

In the EU, Directive 2016/680, which will enter into force in May 2018, aims at protecting individuals with regard to the processing of personal data. In particular, the Directive states that personal data concerning health should include all data pertaining to the health status of a subject which reveal information relating to the past, current or future physical or mental health status of the subject (Article 24). Privacy issues are especially relevant when the database is privately owned, as in the case of some large genetic bio/databanks (e.g. 23andMe). Moreover, analyses are complicated by the fact that data are not stored in a centralised location and by the sheer amount of data to be stored and processed, at great financial cost. For example, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset is over a petabyte in size and consists of more than 575,000 files. Downloading the data using a 10-Gbit-per-second connection would take over 3 weeks (Grossman et al. 2016). It has even been argued that \u2018forgetting\u2019 or shedding information should be part of today\u2019s data management, particularly for techniques requiring fast query answers (Heinis and Ailamaki 2015).",

Standardised methods for storing the data in a common format are therefore required (Batra and Sachdeva 2016). Turning Big Data into knowledge remains, at present, a critical challenge. Exploratory analysis, such as data mining; information visualisation and machine-learning of big databases solely yields possibly spurious associations among variables and not causal links. While an exploratory-data approach is never a substitute for sound causal modelling, it can nevertheless usefully inform it, especially when background knowledge on the topic of interest is scant. A good (i.e. bad!) example of erroneous causal inference is the well-known Google Flu Trends study, matching search terms and flu propensity; the structurally unrelated matches were much too numerous (Lazer et al. 2014). And Big Data does not guarantee the absence of systematic bias if the primary sources themselves are biased, thus the need for a thorough evaluation of the quality of these sources for scientific purposes. In particular, one must know by whom and for what purpose the databases have been made.",
