            "text": "The disease of rabies, known to mankind since the 23rd century BC (see Baer, 2007), remains the best known and most feared of all zoonotic diseases. Most rabies cases reported world\u2010wide are caused by rabies virus (RABV), the prototype of the Lyssavirus genus of the family Rhabdoviridae, although all lyssaviruses can elicit the disease. Control of human rabies is achieved most effectively by elimination of the virus from animal reservoirs that maintain and transmit it to other species. In addition, highly efficacious regimens for human disease prevention exist (Rupprecht et al., 2006). However, rabies still accounts for an estimated 55,000 human deaths world\u2010wide each year (WHO, 2005). Dogs, which have long been associated with the disease, form the major rabies reservoir in the developing world where most human exposures and fatalities occur. Failure to prevent disease in many developing countries is due to several factors: poor control and limited vaccination of dogs, lack of public education, poor public health infrastructure, and the high cost and limited availability of antirabies biologicals. In contrast, developed countries have eliminated rabies from their dog populations and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is available to those exposed to the disease via contact with wildlife reservoirs.",

At the more practical level, development of new reagents such as human neutralizing antirabies glycoprotein (G) monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) are being developed to replace the rabies immune globulin preparations that are in short supply. Efforts to develop improved and cost\u2010effective rabies vaccines continue, primarily to support countrywide pet vaccination programs in the developing world and oral wildlife vaccination for elimination of sylvatic rabies in much of the developed world. Control programs, which require ongoing and timely disease surveillance, are driving the need for field\u2010based diagnostic methods to assist in sylvatic rabies eradication, as well as a comprehensive knowledge of rabies epidemiology and evolution now being revealed through molecular epidemiological techniques. The occasional case of human rabies in the developed world provides continued impetus for development of a therapeutic regimen. However, despite the recent advances in our understanding of virus\u2013host interactions summarized here, successful treatment of clinical rabies requires yet deeper appreciation of the pathogenic mechanisms that result in patient death. The ability to manipulate the RABV genome through reverse genetics permits detailed analysis of the viral features responsible for disease and facilitates some novel applications, including the use of RABV as a neurological tracer to provide unique insights into neuronal pathways and development of novel vaccines directed against rabies and other diseases.",

            "text": "While the direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test applied to fresh brain smears or impressions remains the gold standard method for animal rabies diagnosis, its two main drawbacks are the need for sample shipping to central laboratories and the costs involved in acquiring and maintaining a fluorescence microscope. These requirements often restrict sample submissions, particularly from remote areas, for example, arctic regions, and in many parts of the tropics where sample preservation is problematic. These limitations in turn result in rabies underreporting and underappreciation of its significance. A direct rapid immunohistochemical test (DRIT) for rabies, developed by the Rabies Section of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), may help to address this problem. DRIT employs a light microscope to detect RABV antigen in brain impressions using a cocktail of biotinylated antinucleocapsid Mabs with visualization using a streptavidin\u2013peroxidase complex. In a field evaluation in Tanzania, DRIT performed comparably to the DFA (performed at the CDC) with regards to sensitivity and specificity and thus may, subject to mandated biocontainment requirements, be a viable means of testing animal specimens under field conditions (Lembo et al., 2006). This could facilitate greatly improved surveillance in tropical regions but it might also be useful in developed countries where increased local surveillance is needed to support wildlife oral vaccination campaigns. Another interesting possibility for rapid screening in the field is the use of lateral flow immunochromatography (Kang et al., 2007), although comprehensive validation against established methods is required.",

RT\u2010PCR has also been applied to oral swab screening of wild bat populations for active lyssavirus infection in Europe where most bat species have protected status (Echevarr\u00eda et al., 2001). Although, real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR (RRT\u2010PCR) would have additional advantages for human testing in terms of rapidity and sensitivity, only a few reports describe its application for detection of specific lyssavirus genotypes (Foord et al., 2006, Wakeley et al., 2005). The complexity of designing broadly cross\u2010reactive reagents for a TaqMan\u2010based approach is challenging due to the extent of lyssavirus sequence divergence (Hughes et al., 2004b). A SYBR green\u2010based RRT\u2010PCR, that was more sensitive than conventional RT\u2010PCR for the detection of virus in human saliva samples, may be of value providing its specificity can be assured (Nagaraj et al., 2006). Further evaluation of a nucleic\u2010acid sequence based amplification (NASBA) method, applied to human saliva and cerebrospinal fluid samples is needed (Wacharapluesadee and Hemachudha, 2001). The issue of testing solid organ transplant tissues has been broached in response to rabies transmission via organ transplantation (Srinivasan et al., 2005), but such testing will remain impractical unless faster and more readily accessible tests become available (Jackson, 2004).",

Both antigenic and molecular\u2010based typing techniques have been increasingly applied over the last 15 years (reviewed in Nadin\u2010Davis, 2007). Extensive phylogenetic analyses of RABV (genotype 1) isolates recovered world\u2010wide have identified their detailed phylogeography and revealed the existence of a limited number of major lineages: the heterogeneous \u201cAmerican indigenous\u201d lineage, found only in the Americas, comprised mostly of bat\u2010associated strains and a few species of Carnivora; at least three distinct canid lineages circulating in South\u2010East Asia; an \u201cArctic\u201d lineage that includes viruses from northern circumpolar regions as well as viruses from central and southern Asia; a canid lineage in western Africa; a lineage associated with herpestid and viverrid species in southern Africa; and the cosmopolitan lineage (Nadin\u2010Davis and Bingham, 2004), probably widely dispersed as a result of human colonial activities in the 16th\u201318th centuries, that includes canid\u2010associated viruses of Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and much of Africa, mongoose, skunk and canid associated viruses of the Americas and the Caribbean, as well as most vaccine strains. Ongoing genetic characterization of RABV isolates continues to extend our knowledge of RABV diversity and identifies newly emerging virus\u2013host associations. For example, in the USA alone, a distinct viral variant associated with western pipistrelle bats (Franka et al., 2006) and sustained intraspecific transmission of a bat variant within skunk populations in Arizona (Leslie et al., 2006) were both recently recognized. In Latin America, additional bat\u2010associated variants continue to be identified (Kobayashi et al., 2005).",

A rather shorter time frame of GT 1 lyssavirus diversity of approximately 500 years has also been proposed (Holmes et al., 2002). Although all lyssavirus genes appear to be equally useful for phylogenetic predictions (Wu et al., 2007), Davis et al. (2006) found a lack of congruence in GT 1 evolutionary history, predicted using different genes and were unable to establish whether bat\u2010associated variants or viruses associated with other terrestrial species comprised the most basal evolutionary group. By two different approaches, the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of North American bat RABVs was dated to the mid\u20101600s (combined range of 1254\u20131782) (Hughes et al., 2005); this phylogeny suggested that the parental virus initially branched to yield variants currently associated with free\u2010tailed and vampire bats and this was followed by the emergence of distinct variants associated with solitary and colonial bats of North America. If this prediction is correct, genetic heterogeneity in bat RABVs must depend more on the migratory life\u2010style of the host rather than on the age of the viral lineage.",

A study of two distinct southern African biotypes concluded that the canid and mongoose variants exhibit quite different evolutionary dynamics probably reflecting the different ecological niches of their hosts (Davis et al., 2007). Moreover, the mean age for the MRCA of the mongoose variant was 73 years, placing its emergence around 1930 and not in the 1800s as had previously been supposed (Nel et al., 2005). In general, the time frames estimated by Bayesian methods have wide ranges and predict much shorter time scales than suggested from anecdotal information. Unless larger datasets generate different conclusions, it appears that some of the viruses referred to in past outbreaks belonged to now extinct lineages (Badrane and Tordo, 2001). Coalescent methods generate more coherent time frames when applied to more recent outbreaks (Biek et al., 2007, Hughes et al., 2004a).",

The rapid and well\u2010documented spread of the mid\u2010Atlantic raccoon rabies variant along the eastern seaboard of the USA over the last 30 years has provided extensive surveillance data that permit the development and assessment of such models (Real et al., 2005b). A model that reflects the initial 4\u20135 year epizootic period of raccoon rabies, followed by smaller epizootics of decreasing size and periodicity, was developed (Childs et al., 2000) followed by a stochastic spatial model of rabies spread in the state of Connecticut that identified rivers as key barriers to local dispersion (Smith et al., 2002) and demonstrated the role of long\u2010distance animal translocation in the emergence of new foci of disease (Smith et al., 2005). This spatial model was also used to predict westward expansion of raccoon rabies across Ohio, following an outbreak that breached an oral vaccination zone intended to contain this epizootic, and to assist in the design of supplementary control activities (Russell et al., 2005). More recently, other models explored how to most effectively use natural barriers such as waterways during wildlife oral vaccination campaigns to prevent rabies spread (Russell et al., 2006). Coalescent\u2010based estimates using raccoon RABV genetic data were in good agreement with the known spatial and demographic dynamics of disease spread with time and showed the importance of the initial wave of infection in determining spatial genetic structuring of the epizootic (Biek et al., 2007). In studies of Arctic fox strain rabies, the ecogeographic patterns observed in southern Ontario (Tinline and MacInnes, 2004) were explained by a model that unified the spatial population dynamics and molecular evolution of the RABV (Real et al., 2005a). Insights into patterns of viral spread may also be gained through raccoon genotyping to identify host subpopulation structure (Cullingham et al., 2005). Further gains in our understanding of rabies dynamics and evolution will undoubtedly follow future application of such methods.",

Some degeneration of neuronal processes was noted after infection with pathogenic but not attenuated viruses (Li et al., 2005).

Moreover, RABV G binding to P75NTR requires Lys330 and Arg333 of antigenic site III, residues previously linked to RABV pathogenicity (see below) while mutations at residues flanking this antigenic site interfered with P75NTR binding (Langevin and Tuffereau, 2002). However, other observations argue against a universal role of P75NTR as a lyssavirus receptor. Only lyssaviruses of GT 1 (RABV) and GT 6, EBLV\u20102, interact with P75NTR, so lyssaviruses of all other GTs must gain cell entry via alternate receptor(s) (Tuffereau et al., 2001). Furthermore, viral spread occurs throughout the CNS in P75NTR\u2010deficient mice (Jackson and Park, 1999) and viral infection of primary neurons can occur in the absence of RABV G/P75NTR binding (Tuffereau et al., 2007). While another receptor yet to be identified might function as a universal lyssavirus receptor, it remains possible that these viruses can use a number of different nerve cell receptors to gain entry into the host nervous system. Further study on nerve cell entry by field isolates may help to resolve this issue.",

Structure\u2013function studies involving the production of large numbers of chimeric viruses, each differing at just one amino acid within the G protein, reveal an increasing number of residues important to pathogenicity. In addition to an absolute requirement for Arg or Lys at residue 333 (Takayama\u2010Ito et al., 2006a, Tuffereau et al., 1989), amino acids Ala242, Asp255 and Ile268, especially when present together, confer the highly pathogenic phenotype of the Nishigahara strain (Takayama\u2010Ito et al., 2006b). An Asn to Lys mutation at residue 194 restored pathogenicity to a highly attenuated RABV strain by increasing viral spread, eliciting faster cellular internalization and shifting the pH threshold for membrane fusion (Faber et al., 2005b). However, in addition to the protein's primary structure, the level of G protein expression also has important pathogenic consequences; in general, more pathogenic strains produce lower amounts of G protein that in turn may limit the host's apoptotic (Yan et al., 2001) and innate immune system responses (Wang et al., 2005). Interestingly, nonpathogenic G genes are dominant over pathogenic versions (Faber et al., 2007).",

P proteins are targeted by two distinct cellular kinases (Gupta et al., 2000) that phosphorylate several variably conserved sites (Nadin\u2010Davis et al., 2002). The cellular distribution of these various forms of P is determined by multiple localization signals present at different locations along its primary sequence.

Dynein LC8 Interaction One intriguing interaction of the lyssavirus P protein is its association with the dynein light chain LC8 (Jacob et al., 2000, Raux et al., 2000), a 10 kDa component of both the cytoplasmic dynein motor and Myosin V, which is involved in minus end\u2010directed movement of organelles along microtubules and in actin\u2010mediated vesicle transport in axons. Although functional studies on this interaction have been performed only on GT 1 and GT 3 representatives (Jacob et al., 2000), the genus\u2010wide importance of this association is suggested by the absolute conservation of the LC8 binding domain (BD) motif D(K/R)XTQT at P protein residues 143\u2013148 (Nadin\u2010Davis et al., 2002, Poisson et al., 2001). This finding fueled the hypothesis that P/LC8 interaction facilitated microtubule\u2010directed minus\u2010sense axonal transport of RABV ribonucleoprotein to the cell body and thus played a pivotal role in the spread of the virus within the host's nervous system. However, doubt on this model was cast by the fact that viruses lacking the LC8 BD, although slowed in their rate of spread, could still gain entry into the CNS from the periphery (Mebatsion, 2001, Rasalingam et al., 2005). Tan et al. (2007)) showed that loss of the LC8 BD from P reduced transcription levels in neuronal cells and thus proposed that P protein/LC8 association was important for efficient viral RNA polymerase activity, a role consistent with the P protein's function as an L protein cofactor. Interestingly, the LC8 BD motif can facilitate nuclear protein importation, suggesting that this motif facilitates some nuclear function of P (Moseley et al., 2007b).",

Through a motif present in the 125 C\u2010terminal residues of P protein, P1 binds to PML and retains it in the cytoplasm while P3 binds to nuclear PML, reorganizes the nuclear bodies and increases their size.

Apoptosis was especially prominent in the pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, prime targets for rabies infection, and suckling mice, which are more susceptible to the disease, exhibited higher levels of apoptosis than adults (Jackson and Park, 1998, Theerasurakarn and Ubol, 1998). Although elevated levels of Bax were observed in murine neuroblastoma cells within 24 h of infection, followed by up\u2010regulation of caspase 1 (Ubol et al., 1998), bax\u2010deficient mice still exhibited significant apoptosis thereby implicating additional apoptotic modulators (Jackson, 1999). Using CVS strains that differ in their pathogenicity, Morimoto et al. (1999) observed a good correlation between high levels of apoptosis and high RABV G accumulation in mouse primary neuronal cell cultures. Similar conclusions were made using recombinant viruses differing in G protein expression levels (Faber et al., 2002); high expression of RABV G was accompanied by increases in caspase 3 activity and other apoptosis markers as well as higher anti\u2010G antibody titers in mice. The speed or extent of apoptosis may directly determine the magnitude of the antibody response as suggested by experiments employing a recombinant virus expressing the pro\u2010apoptotic cytochrome c gene (Pulmanausahakul et al., 2001).",

High levels of NO are cytotoxic and activation of iNOS in macrophages is regarded as an inflammatory mediator (Aktan, 2004). Up\u2010regulation of iNOS in the RABV\u2010infected rat brain was proposed to contribute to neuropathogenesis (Akaike et al., 1995) and indeed treatment of RABV\u2010infected mice with a selective inhibitor of iNOS delayed viral replication, apoptotic cell death and death of the host significantly (Ubol et al., 2001). RABV virions can enter macrophages via endocytosis, and, despite limited virion replication, activate expression of iNOS as well as the CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10), a T helper cell type\u20101 chemo\u2010attractant (Nakamichi et al., 2004); thus increases in NO levels contribute to macrophage activation in response to RABV infection. The significance of these observations was further extended to microglia cells, the functional equivalents of macrophages in the CNS. RABV entry into microglia was followed, even in the absence of significant replication, by strong induction of the chemokines CXCL10 and CCL5 through activation of several signaling pathways (Nakamichi et al., 2005).",

            "text": "While various experimental models of rabies, including the extensive use of laboratory strains of mice, provide important insights into the disease, many of the host's transcriptional changes observed upon RABV infection likely represent common host pathways for countering infection by neurotrophic viruses (Saha and Rangarajan, 2003). Dissecting out those changes that are especially relevant to RABV pathogenesis will prove difficult although, based on the information now being collected, transgenic mice might yet play an important role in this regard. Furthermore, there are significant differences in the extent of gene activation and the cell types affected in mice depending on the RABV strain employed (Prosniak et al., 2003b). Street strains limit the response of type\u20101 IFN and inflammatory pathways far more effectively than avirulent strains, perhaps due in part to a lower level of G expression that limits TLR3\u2010associated activation of the innate immune system (Wang et al., 2005). An accurate appreciation of the pathogenic mechanisms operating in natural infections will require further studies employing street isolates inoculated into their normal reservoir hosts. Presently the lack of tools and reagents to study many of the processes described here in natural rabies hosts (e.g., dog, fox, skunk, raccoon, and bat species) impedes such work. Furthermore, it is evident that a full appreciation of RABV propagation and virulence requires not only an understanding of which host genes play pivotal roles but in which cell types these genes function. Studies that do not consider the heterogeneous cell population of the CNS may miss effects that are restricted to a particular cell type. Ultimately, a combination of immunohistochemical methods and in situ RT\u2010PCR (see Nuovo et al., 2005) may prove invaluable for identifying the cell types and molecular mechanisms most critical to RABV pathogenicity in natural infections.",

            "text": "One application of this technology is to generate novel rabies vaccines. While the use of inactivated rabies vaccines that are safe and efficacious following parenteral administration in humans and animals is well established, logistical considerations dictate that oral vaccination will remain the primary means of controlling sylvatic rabies (Rupprecht et al., 2006). Only live attenuated vaccines have to date been proven effective via the oral route. There is continued interest in developing live attenuated RABV vaccines that are safer and more efficacious than the ERA/SAD B19 strains currently used for oral vaccination of foxes in Europe and North America and, in particular, vaccines that are efficacious in other wildlife reservoirs. A common approach is to engineer viruses that express higher levels of G protein that in turn elicits production of protective virus neutralizing antibody (VNA). A recombinant ERA, in which the order of the M and G genes was rearranged so as to increase G protein expression, was less virulent in mice than parental ERA (Wu and Rupprecht, 2008). A rRABV derived from the RC\u2010HL strain carrying two copies of the wt G gene had increased levels of G protein in virions and in infected cells; this double G virus remained pathogenic in mice but after inactivation it was significantly more immunogenic than the parent virus and may be useful as an inactivated rabies vaccine (Hosokawa\u2010Muto et al., 2006). SAD B19\u2010derived constructs, in which the G gene was mutated to encode either a Glu or Gln at position 333 instead of Arg, had greatly reduced pathogenicity in mice and elicited VNA upon intramuscular (i.m.) and oral inoculation that afforded protection from lethal challenge (Faber et al., 2002, Morimoto et al., 2001). A rRABV containing two copies of the Glu333\u2010mutated G gene (SPBNGA\u2010GA) resulted in significantly increased G protein expression and hence elicited significantly higher VNA titers in mice and improved survivorship after challenge over the construct (SPBN\u2010GA) with one G gene copy (Faber et al., 2002).",

When given to mice by either intraperitoneal (i.p.) or i.m. inoculation, the P\u2010deficient rRABV elicited VNA in a dose\u2010dependent manner and protected against lethal intracranial challenge with CVS (Shoji et al., 2004). Similarly, i.m. and intranasal inoculation with the M\u2010deficient rRABV elicited VNA production, but protection against challenge was not determined (Ito et al., 2005).",

Constructs which have been generated include those based on human adenovirus type\u20105 (HAd5), using either E3\u2010deleted (Yarosh et al., 1996) or E1\u2010deleted vector backbones (Vos et al., 2001, Xiang et al., 1996), chimpanzee adenovirus serotype 68 (AdC68) (Xiang et al., 2002) or canine adenovirus type\u20102 (CAV\u20102) (Hu et al., 2006, Li et al., 2006). The immunogenicity of many of these constructs was established in the murine model as well as in a number of other target species. An AdRG1.3 construct, originally described by Yarosh et al. (1996), and shown to be highly efficacious in skunks via the oral route (Knowles et al., manuscript in preparation) is now being assessed in a bait formulation in limited field trials for rabies control in skunks in Ontario, Canada (see http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/csb/news/2006/aug18nr2_06.html). CAV\u20102 recombinant vaccines, based upon a live vaccine already employed in dogs, were immunogenic in mice (Li et al., 2006) and in dogs after subcutaneous inoculation (Hu et al., 2006). Oral administration in dogs elicited strong long\u2010term serological responses and protected against challenge (Zhang et al., 2008) while protective serological responses in cats required i.m. administration (Hu et al., 2007). Further evaluation of some of these constructs for licensing purposes appears likely. One concern with use of adenoviral\u2010based vaccines is that prior adenovirus infection might generate immunity to the vector and thereby limit the vaccine's efficacy. Indeed, the anti\u2010RABV G antibody response of mice given a HAd5RABG recombinant can be compromised by pre\u2010exposure to the homologous adenovirus (Xiang et al., 2002). The use of vaccines based on several different adenovirus vectors that elicit limited serological cross\u2010reactivity may be one means of overcoming such a limitation (Xiang et al., 2002).",

Proof of principle for this approach, which involves inoculation of the animal with DNA of a plasmid that directs expression of the RABV G protein under a strong viral promoter, was demonstrated in the mouse model some years ago (Xiang et al., 1994). Difficulties in transferring this technology to larger mammals were encountered, though its feasibility for eliciting strong immune responses in cats and dogs was reported by Osorio et al. (1999) and protection of beagles from challenge using a two\u2010dose immunization schedule administered i.m. was reported shortly thereafter (Perrin et al., 2000). Evaluation of different methods of immunizing dogs using a single DNA vaccine dose suggested that intradermal (i.d.) application into the ear pinnae was the method of choice (Lodmell et al., 2003) and could protect dogs challenged 1 year later (Lodmell et al., 2006). Experimental and field trials undertaken in Tunisia, suggested that DNA immunization, administered by jet injector into the inner ear of local dogs, was more effective in eliciting long\u2010lasting VNA and protection than a cell culture\u2010derived vaccine (Bahloul et al., 2006). Intranasal application of a two\u2010dose regimen of DNA vaccine has also been reported to induce a good immune response in dogs (Tesoro Cruz et al., 2006). An evaluation of DNA vaccines to immunize horses against rabies reported that formulation of the DNA with a cationic lipid, given as a two\u2010dose regimen, elicited a good serological response (Fischer et al., 2003); the application of this technology in equines could potentially be very important in Latin America where transmission of vampire bat rabies to livestock continues to cause significant losses. Bahloul et al. (2003) also proposed a potential role for DNA immunization in PEP based on experiments in the mouse model where a single dose of DNA vaccine given the same day as a RABV challenge was more effective than five doses of cell culture\u2010derived vaccine given over 28 days, though it must be pointed out that overall protection rates (53% and 40%, respectively) were low.",

A later study showed some protection from challenge in macaques 1 year after administration of a single DNA vaccine dose given either via gene gun or i.m., though protection was not complete and did not appear to correlate well with presence of VNA (Lodmell et al., 2002a). Another study suggested the superiority of i.m. over i.d. administration of DNA vaccines in nonhuman primates and demonstrated the need for a booster dose 6 months after the initial immunization to maintain adequate VNA levels (Biswas et al., 2001). Use of DNA immunization for PEP in monkeys was less effective, with a 50% protection rate compared to 75% using the human diploid cell vaccine, despite attempts to accelerate the VNA induction using gene gun vaccination into specific tissues (Lodmell et al., 2002b). Based on these data, the further development of DNA vaccines for human disease prevention, especially for PEP, is not currently advocated (Ertl, 2003).",

Present vaccines, which are based on selected strains of GT 1, do not elicit production of antibodies that effectively neutralize members of the more divergent lyssaviruses, especially those of GTs 2 and 3. However, Jallet et al. (1999) described various DNA vaccines, comprising chimeric glycoprotein constructs generated from the G genes of the PV (GT 1), Mokola (GT 3), and EBLV\u20101 (GT 5) lyssaviruses, which broaden the spectrum of protection compared to the homologous sequences. Moreover, attempts to generate a DNA vaccine against Mokola virus using the Mokola G gene inserted into several different plasmid vectors showed some promise in mouse models (Nel et al., 2003). Since very few reported rabies cases are due to lyssaviruses other than those of GT 1, a significant rise in the number of such cases would be needed to drive further commercial development of such vaccines; the recent emergence of several divergent lyssaviruses (see Section II.B) may result in greater attention to this issue in the future.",

Fine mapping of CNS neuronal pathways at the cellular level requires the use of neuronal tracers and although a variety of chemical compounds have been employed for such purposes (reviewed in K\u00f6bbert et al., 2000), these are limited due to nonspecific cell uptake and dilution effects that restrict their usefulness to cells immediately adjacent to those of the injection site. To overcome such limitations, neurotropic viruses such as herpes simplex virus\u20101 (HSV\u20101), pseudorabies virus (reviewed in Loewy, 1998), and more recently, RABV were investigated for their utility in mapping neuronal pathways. Viral replication in infected cells naturally amplifies its signal and allows mapping of higher\u2010order neural connections. Despite their advantages, tracer studies using \u03b1\u2010herpesviruses can be confounded due to virus\u2010induced cytotoxicity and the generation, under certain conditions, of spurious labeling by local and nonspecific spread between cells (reviewed in Norgren and Lehman, 1998).",

Following stereotactic injection of virus into specific nerves, muscles or brain areas of the test subject and a defined incubation time, the animal tissue is perfused with fixative, sectioned, and finally stained to determine the distribution of infected cells. In theory, by adjusting the survival time following RABV inoculation, an unlimited number of serially connected neurons can be visualized and precise mapping of neuronal networks and connections is possible. Model systems thus employed include primates, rats, guinea pigs, and adult and neonatal mice. Since the rate of RABV transport can vary depending on the virus preparation\u2014variant, passage history, size of inoculum\u2014as well as on the animal species (Kelly and Strick, 2003, Ugolini, 1995), the time course of labeling must be established for each model system to allow determination of the sequential order of neurons in a pathway. While the CVS variants (CVS\u201011, \u201026, \u2010N2c and \u2010B2c) employed as neuronal tracers are fixed viruses, with various levels of pathogenicity, tracing studies are usually sufficiently short such that the test subjects do not develop clinical rabies.",

Secondly, RABV has been injected into specific function\u2010related areas of the brain to identify cells that are pre\u2010synaptic to those initially infected, thereby revealing the neurons that project into these sites. A number of such studies have examined the organization of neuronal pathways and the connections between the primary motor cortex and the cerebellum or the basal ganglia (Clower et al., 2005, Kelly and Strick, 2004, Lu et al., 2007), and within the visual cortex (Nassi and Callaway, 2006).

Together with previous studies demonstrating that the SMA and pre\u2010SMA neurons project to separate regions of the basal ganglia (Inase et al., 1999), these observations suggest that the SMA and the pre\u2010SMA are nodes in distinct neural systems that form separated closed\u2010loop circuits with the basal ganglia. The observation that the basal ganglia, rather than the cerebellum, provided the dominant input to these two nodes may provide an anatomical explanation for why cerebellar hyperactivity in Parkinson's disease does not normalize SMA activity. Hoshi et al. (2005) demonstrated an anatomical pathway that directly links the output stage of cerebellar processing to the input stage of basal ganglia processing. This novel observation implies that the cerebellum may be able to adjust basal ganglia activity and suggests a role for the cerebellum in motor and cognitive functions normally associated with basal ganglia dysfunction.",

Such infected neurons expressed high levels of eGFP thus permitting a detailed study of the morphology and physiology of neurons at injection sites in the brain. RABV\u2010eGFP was found to be superior to another monosynaptic retrograde tracer, HIV\u20101 pseudotyped with RABV G protein. Further refinements have been made to this system, in which RABV\u2010eGFP was pseudotyped with the envelope protein EnvA from the subgroup A avian sarcoma and leucosis virus. RABV\u2010eGFP/EnvA can infect only those cells expressing the EnvA receptor, the gene for which is introduced by electroporation, and can spread monosynaptically to projecting cells if the RABV G is also provided in trans (Wickersham et al., 2007b). In this way, neurons directly pre\u2010synaptic to the EnvA receptor\u2010expressing cells can be unambiguously identified. This system is novel and powerful in that for the first time, it provides a tool for identifying neurons that are monosynaptically connected to a cell group, or even a single cell, and can distinguish weak, direct connections from strong, indirect ones, features which sometimes can confound interpretation of results using conventional RABV trans\u2010synaptic tracers.

Even if current approaches to eliminate rabies from known carnivore reservoirs were eventually successful, the occasional cryptic infection of humans from chiropteran reservoirs (Messenger et al., 2002), which are generally not targeted by any comprehensive control strategies at present, will continue to drive the need for effective therapy. Indeed, much excitement surrounded the recovery of a patient from Wisconsin who survived clinical rabies without ever receiving antirabies biologics. The therapy applied in this case involved induction of coma and provision of antiviral drugs and agents to combat neuronal damage while the patient developed an adaptive immune response (Willoughby et al., 2005). However, several attempts to replicate this success failed (Christenson et al., 2007, Hemachudha et al., 2006, Schmiedel et al., 2007), perhaps either due to differences in pathogenicity of the RABV strains involved or variations in patient care, particularly prior to the diagnosis of rabies. To establish the merit of this approach, further experimentation using various animal and nonhuman primate models may be required. In a mouse model opening of the blood\u2013brain barrier to allow infiltration of immune effectors appears to be a critical feature for preventing a lethal rabies outcome (Roy and Hooper, 2007, Roy et al., 2007). As well, future development of novel antiviral therapies (Real et al., 2004) may greatly improve the odds of surviving this most lethal of diseases.",
