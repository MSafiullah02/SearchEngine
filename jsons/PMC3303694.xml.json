Each of the models leads to development of a complex of structural and functional changes, as decrease of cross-sectional area and contractile activity of muscle itself and its single fibers [4\u20137]. There are also changes in myosin phenotype observed [8, 9] as well as enzyme activity [1]. Such hypogravitational syndrome [10] is supposed to be caused by changes in concentration and activity of factors circulating in blood (glucocorticoids and anabolic steroids) [11]. At the same time, cortisol was shown to affect muscle under disuse indirectly [12]; while in muscle cytosol, quite high concentration of glucocorticoid receptors was observed [13]. Consequently, there are other mechanisms involved in muscle atrophy stimulation and development during unloading.",

Calcium redistribution between cytoplasm and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) during muscle atrophy caused by different diseases was first demonstrated about 30 years ago [25, 26]. Later, it was shown that 14 days of rat HS significantly increased induced by caffeine Ca2+ efflux from soleus SR [27]. However, myoplasm overloading with calcium was demonstrated only in 2001 by Ingalls et al. [28] who registered Ca2+ quantity increase at the 3rd day of rats functional unloading. Dihydropyridine-sensitive channels (DHPCs) and ryanodine receptors (RYRs) are main Ca2+ channels. DHPCs are the L-type Ca2+ channels, m.w. 165 kDa, specifically blocked by dihydropyridine [29]. They are localized predominantly in T-tubes of muscle fibers and are activated by depolarization of fiber membrane. At that, Ca2+ enters myoplasm without consumption of ATP hydrolysis energy.",

Moreover, we found twofold increase in soluble calpain fraction activity and fivefold increment of membrane fraction activity after 3 days of animal disuse [38] and were first to show directly that increase in [Ca2+] stimulates \u03bc-calpain activity, which in its turn activates m-calpains [20, 36]. Local application of Ca2+ chelator 1 ,2-bis(2-aminophenoxi)ethan-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetraacetate (BAPTA-AM) to soleus during unloading allowed us to demonstrate directly dependence of calpain activity on [Ca2+] in vivo [38]. Importantly, techniques for determination of calpain activity used in the works [37] and [38] registered the enzymes activity at high millimolar concentration of calcium in the incubation medium, where higher activity of all calpain molecules was observed. Increase in calpains activity under disuse can be caused by their expression intensification or by other Ca2+-independent regulators, as calpastatin. Thus, hindlimb suspension leads to pronounced decrement of calpastatin expression in soleus, while calpain 1 expression increases slightly [39]. Activity of calpains decreased in unloaded muscle under local application of calcium chelator [38] can be evidence of Ca2+-dependence of regulation of calpastatin expression.",

Calcium accumulation under disuse activates calpains, which partly degrade titin molecule or change its conformation [41, 48]. Titin not only is involved in fiber contractility, but also realizes its signaling function through phosphorylation of ubiquitin ligases (MuRF-1 and MuRF-2) localized near titin kinase domain (in M-line), which can affect the titin molecule itself [49, 50]. 14-day HS is known to significantly decrease relative content of titin in rat soleus (Table 1) [51\u201353]. The same decrease of titin content was observed in human soleus after 7 days of dry immersion experiment [10], interestingly, that titin molecule remains intact at the 3rd day of animal HS [7, 51]. These results prove that, at the early stage of disuse, titin remains intact in spite of myoplasm overloading with calcium [7, 28] and increase in calpain activity. Consequently, phosphorylation of titin bound UPS components and their low activity is maintained. Meanwhile, calpastatin overexpression in mice under disuse was shown to prevent slow-to-fast shift in myosin heavy chains (MHCs) [21]. Probably, degradation of one of the calpain targets under disuse impairs regulation of slow MHC expression, which determines MHC phenotype transformation. Moreover, calpain 2 under HS translocates into the nucleus, where it initiates apoptosis [54]. Thus, calpains in skeletal muscles besides their direct proteolytic activity possess also signaling properties, which are realized partly through the E3-ubiquitin ligases [50].",

At the same time, studies on volunteers during antiorthostatic head-down bed-rest showed increased MuRF-1 quantity in soleus (slow muscle), rather than in vastus lateralis (containing predominantly fast fibers) [69]. Later, expression intensification of MAFbx and ubiquitin ligase cbl-b was found in vastus lateralis after 20 days of disuse [70]. After 48 hours of unilateral lower limb suspension of volunteers, complete genomic analysis revealed increase in expression rate of mRNA of E3 ubiquitin ligases [71], also accumulation of 3-metilhistidine, product of degradation of myofibril proteins (actin and some myosin) was observed [72]. Ten days of immobilization caused threefold increase in MuRF-1 mRNA content in quadriceps femoris, which, however, was diminished to the control level to the 21st day of unloading [73]. We also observed changes in expression rate of ubiquitin ligases under HS of animals. Thus, we found that expression rate of MuRF-1 and MAFbx mRNA in rat soleus increased 3 .3 and 2 .1 times, correspondingly, at the 3rd day of disuse. To the 7th day of HS, this parameter decreased but was 1 .27 and 1 .52 times higher than in control (Figure 3) [74]. The 37% increase in total level of protein ubiquitination at the 4th day of functional unloading [75] confirms our data.",

            "text": "Recently, information appeared about functions of another E3 ubiquitin ligase, MuRF-2, which is splice variant of MuRF-1. MuRF-2 is usually found in embryonic muscle, while, in adult animals, its quantity decreased. In spite of its predominant localization in cytoplasm, partly MuRF-2 is bound to nbr1 and p62 proteins, which localize at titin molecule near M-line (Figure 4) [49, 76]. Normally, one of the main functions of this protein is stabilization of microtubules population and several proteins of sarcomeric cytoskeleton (desmin, vimentin) during myofibrillogenesis [62]. Besides, along with MuRF-1, MuRF-2 participates in ubiquitination of myofibril proteins [77]. It should be noticed that MuRF-2 is regulated, at least partly, by titin-dependent mechanism [62]. Changes in spatial arrangement of titin kinase domain after denervation can cause loss of its main function. Consequently, dephosphorylated MuRF-2 dissociates from titin and translocates into the nucleus, where it forces out serum response factor protein (SRF), which is responded for c-fos-mediated stimulation of protein synthesis, cytoskeletal molecules expression, and expression of several growth factors. Our preliminary data showed MuRF-2 translocation to the nucleus and its increased expression under disuse. Thus, 7 days of HS caused increase in MuRF-2 concentration as in myoplasm (from 32.2 + 5.2 r.u. to 291.9 + 58.5 r.u., according to western blot densitometry data), so in nucleus (from 56.1 + 6.1 to 769.4 + 62.2 r.u.) (unpublished data). Increment of MuRF-2 protein quantity increased further being almost twice as higher at the 14th day of disuse in myoplasm and nucleus. Thus, disuse induces synthesis and translocation of MuRF-2 into the nucleus. According to the data of Lange et al. [49], it seems that titin conformational changes under unloading should cause degradation of signaling complex, associated with titin kinase domain, and allow MuRF-2 migration to the nucleus. Such change in protein conformation was observed after 2 days of unloading [53], while data of other authors did not reveal any changes in titin content at the 3rd day of disuse [7, 53]. MuRF-2 concentration in nucleus fraction of rat soleus did not change, as compared to control, at the 3rd day of HS. However, data exist, which demonstrate titin stability at the 3rd day of HS; only after 7 days of HS, titin was degraded noticeably (Table 1). These data confirm that at the early stage of unloading myoplasm overloading with calcium [7, 28] and calpains activation cannot stimulate titin proteolysis and, thus, ubiquitin ligases dephosphorylation. Therefore, two triggers of MuRF-1 and MuRF-2 dephosphorylation can exist: Ca2+-dependent calpain activation, which initiates myofibril proteins disorganization, and titin conformational changes caused by titin sensitivity to mechanical strain. Further studies are necessary to answer the question.",

At that, lack of MuRF-1 noticeably prevented atrophy of II type fibers of tibialis anterior [79]. In double knockouts expression of myozenin-1 (calsarcin-1), an endogenous inhibitor of calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway was blocked. Obviously, nucleus localization of MuRF-1 and MuRF-2 stimulates calsarcin expression leading to stabilization of fast phenotype of muscle fiber. Mice MuRF-1 knockouts did not show significant atrophy of soleus after 10 days of HS, while fatigue characteristics were more pronounced, posttetanic potentiation was not as increased as in mice of wild type [80].

TNF\u03b1, in its turn, induces muscle fibers apoptosis and specific transcription mechanism, which blocks IGF-1-induced anabolic process [84]. Inactivated NFkB forms complex with IkB in myoplasm. TNF\u03b1 stimulates IkB kinase, which phosphorylates IkB leading to ubiquitination and degradation of proteins of this family. NFkB then moves to the nucleus and binds to sense sequence of DNA, thus regulating transcription of NFkB-dependent genes. TNF\u03b1-induced NFkB activation is known to suppress regulatory muscle factor MyoD at posttranscriptional level [85]. In 2004, Cai and colleagues demonstrated at least partial relation of muscle atrophy caused by cachexia, with activation of MuRF-1, but not with MAFbx [86]. This discovery stimulated study of action mechanism of NFkB system in muscles under disuse.",

            "text": "It was found that atrophy caused by functional unloading in rodents can be partly explained by TNF\u03b1-independent activation of NFkB. Seven days of HS in soleus stimulated DNA-binding activity of NFkB and led to an increase of reporter proteins p-50, c-Rel, and nuclear IkB protein Bcl-3 [86, 87]. Akt activation and TNF\u03b1 expression did not increase as it happened during cachexia. These facts proved mechanism of atypical activation of NFkB during atrophy caused by functional unloading. This mechanism was called trans-regulation [87]. Importantly, NFkB pathway was not activated under disuse in fast muscles [87]. Possible targets of trans-activation of NFkB under hypokinesia were found recently [88]. Disuse was shown to induce NFkB-dependent increase in expression rate of ubiquitin ligases MAFbx and Nedd4. Analysis of 5\u2032-flanking sites of genes of these ligases allowed finding numerous potential binding sites of NFkB. Moreover, 4EBP1, FoxO3a, and cathepsin L (lysosomal enzyme, which degrades membrane proteins) are also possible targets of NFkB; their expression was increased under disuse atrophy [88]. At the same time, in mice overexpressing IKK\u03b2, specific component of muscle signaling pathway, 15-fold increase in NFkB activity was shown to stimulate MuRF-1 activity. In the experiments with C2 C12 culture of myotubes, 4.6-fold rise of MuRF-1 promoter activity was found, which was blocked by IkB\u03b1-SR transfection. Thus, as opposed to disuse-stimulated atrophy, during TNF-\u03b1-dependent atrophy, induction of MuRF-1 transcription was observed [87]. These data reveal predominant NFkB-mediated activation of MAFbx under disuse, while MuRF-1 is stimulated by NFkB during other kinds of atrophy. Since MuRF-1 is known to be activated under muscle wasting, there must be other mechanisms which activate MuRF-1 expression. Thus, transcription regulators FoxO1 and FoxO3 were shown to activate MuRF-1 expression [89, 90].",

Model of atrophy on myotube culture revealed decrease of activity of IGF-1/insulin/phosphatidilinositol-3-kinase (PI3 K/Akt) signaling pathway, which caused initiation of FoxO transcription factors and MAFbx induction (Figure 5) [93]. Importantly, FoxO3 directly interacts with MAFbx promoter stimulating expression of the proteases genes, which leads to atrophy of myotubes in culture and animal muscle fibers [93].

In other words, myostatin blocks myoblasts growth in the cell, inhibiting thus the expression of myogenic factors as MyoD and p21 [102]. Myostatin negatively regulates activation and self-renewal of cells and, probably, participates in process of the satellite cells silencing [103]. Thus, myostatin activity maintenance under disuse, possibly, promotes maintenance of low level of myofibers renewal and prevents potential increase in satellite cells proliferation and fusion.",

Autophagy is an integral property of muscle cells, which is confirmed by huge number of autophagosomes in humans with myopathies caused by different diseases or during pharmacological inhibition of lysosomal function by chloroquine, for instance [106]. However, lysosomal enzymes are differently activated during atrophy induced by denervation [107] and unloading [108]. According to biochemical and electron microscope data, lysosomal degradation of proteins is responsible mainly for denervation-induced atrophy [78, 107\u2013109]. These results are in accordance with the data that chloroquine practically cannot block proteolysis during hypokinesia/hypogravity but inhibits it during soleus denervation [110]. Moreover, significant activation of Ca2+-dependent carbothiolic proteases and decrease of total cathepsin B and D activity were observed under disuse stimulated by hindlimb unloading, while denervation-induced disuse caused the highest activity of the cathepsins [17]. At the same time, recently, catepsin L quantity was shown to be increased during HS [58, 111]. Role of catepsin L is unknown. Thus, increment of certain catepsins concentration proves some lysosomal system activation during denervation-induced atrophy but does not have significant contribution of lysosomes to HS-induced atrophy [111]. Catepsins are known to be inactivated at neutral pH in cytoplasm. Proteolysis with catepsins is carried out inside the lysosomes; thus, they cannot degrade myofibril proteins despite of their activation. Therefore, lysosomal system contribution into catabolism of myofibril proteins during atrophy is not sufficient [112].",

Cleaved actin fragments were also found in rat muscles after diabetes and chronic uremia [116]. Caspases were shown to be activated during rat hindlimb unloading [117, 118]. Interestingly, at the 5th day of HS, only caspase-3 content increased, while, at the 10th day of disuse, caspases-6 and 9 were activated. These data confirm that caspase-3 activates as through mitochondria-independent, so through mitochondria-dependent pathway during unloading caused by HS. However, the entire mechanism of mitochondria-independent caspase regulation needs further investigation. Physiological role of caspase content increment can be the myonuclei number regulation through apoptosis, which leads to synthesis activity decrease. Though, it was found that caspase-3 increase caused decrease in myonuclei number [119] and stimulated DNA fragmentation at the 14th day of HS [120].

            "text": "Alterations of structure and function of skeletal muscle under functional unloading, so called, muscle plasticity, are caused not only by increment of muscle proteins degradation. It is better to say that disuse atrophy is the result of shift of the balance between protein synthesis and proteolysis towards increase in proteolysis and decrease of synthesis intensity. Main signaling system regulating protein synthesis in muscles is the Akt/mTOR pathway, which is activated when IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1) binds with its receptor on myofiber membrane. This signaling cascade is responsible for stimulation of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle fibers realizing its effect particularly through stimulation of proliferation and fusion of satellite cells (Figure 5) [111]. mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) is a part of two multiprotein complexes, one of which is mTORC1 (sensitive to rapamycin). mTORC1 activates S6 K and 4EBP, through which Akt-FoxO signal is realized. mTOR effect on translation process and protein synthesis is realized through TORC1-dependent phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinases (S6 K1 and S6 K2) and 4EBP, a repressor of a cap-binding protein eIF4 E. S6 K1 is an important component of Akt cascade, which is confirmed by experiments on mice S6 K1 knockouts. Those mice had very small fibers, and could not respond to activated Akt and IGF-1 [121]. Thus, protein synthesis intensification through PI3 K/Akt/mTOR mechanism is realized by means of activation of S6 K1, eukaryotic factor of translation initiation 4 E (eIF4 E), and inhibition of translation regulator 4EBP1. At the same time, IGF-1/PI3 K/Akt pathway prevents atrophy development by inhibition (dephosphorylation by Akt) of transcription regulation factors FoxO1 -3, stimulating their transition from nucleus to cytoplasm [93]. Activity of IGF-1 plays an important role during functional unloading, since ability of muscle cells to bind insulin increased noticeably under disuse. At that, total quantity of insulin receptors did not change [122]. At the same time, activity of PI3 K/Akt signaling cascade, which plays role of central regulator between insulin and IGF-1 receptor, and activated synthetic pathways in muscle, were shown to be diminished significantly [123, 124]. Moreover, it was clearly demonstrated that c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) significantly increased after 10 days of rat HS, as in predominantly fast [125, 126], so in predominantly slow muscles [127], on the models of animal HS [125, 127], cast immobilization [126], and denervation [128]. Independently of the model used increment in JNK level evidences that IRS-1 protein is phosphorylated, Akt activity is suppressed, and insulin resistance develops in the wasting muscle. Therefore, activation of PI3 K/Akt signaling pathway is important for disused muscle reloading. Nevertheless, it is not the only way of protein synthesis intensification. Eukaryotic initiation factor 4 E (eIF4 E), one of the components of eIF4 F complex interacts with eIF3 complex, which regulates assembling of 43 S preinitiation complex (PIC) [129]. eIF3 directly captures 40 S ribosomal subunit stimulating its interaction with Met-tRNA-eIF2-GTP complex and with eIF1. Due to interaction of eIF3 and eIF4 E-mRNA, mRNA binds 43 S ribosomal complex forming 48 S complex, which initiates synthesis of muscle proteins. Studies revealed 13 different subunits of eIF3 complex with molecular mass varying from 170 to 25 kDa. Five of these subunits form the main nucleus of the complex, and others have regulatory function. Role of one of these subunits, eIF3-f, is not known well, though in yeasts and coronaviruses, decrease of eIF3-f quantity leads to significant reduction of total protein content in dividing cells and to decrement of cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 [130]. IL-6, in its turn, is an essential factor of development of skeletal muscle hypertrophy mediated by proliferating satellite cells [131]. In humans, eIF3-f decrease is related to tumor development, while its overexpression suppresses cell growth and leads to apoptosis stimulation [65].",

Meanwhile, our study of stretch combined with HS for 7 days showed twofold (and after 14 days of disuse with stretch threefold) increase in MuRF-1 and MAFbx expression in soleus [75]. At the same time, these effects were accompanied by significant rise of IGF-1 expression in soleus, which allows maintaining of proteolysis-synthesis balance in the stretched unloaded muscle with high UPS expression level. IGF-1 expression activation itself can promote decrease in the expression rate of ubiquitin ligases through the induction of Akt phosphorylation, as was described in [90].",

Change of one of its components will certainly lead to alteration of many others. At that, activity of all chains involved in the net is directed differently; therefore, any imbalance of the system should initiate processes of homeostasis maintaining. Functional unloading leads to atrophy of skeletal muscles, which manifests in increased proteolysis leading to decrease of fiber size, muscle mass loss, function deterioration, loss of Ca2+ sensitivity, and so forth. However, under disuse, balance between protein synthesis and proteolysis shifts so that muscle adapts to the altered circumstances. This conclusion is supported by accumulated knowledge about activity of signaling systems, which take part in proteolysis and synthesis of muscle proteins, as NFkB, for instance. Thus, under disuse, NFkB is activated independently of TNF\u03b1 (decreasing IGF-1-dependent pathway), which may be important, because, in this case, a number of factors blocking PI3 K/Akt pathway and protein synthesis are activated. Thus, unchanged Akt level allows keeping phosphorylation level of FoxO3 and restraining the latter in myoplasm.",
