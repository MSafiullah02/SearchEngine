More than 200 viruses are major etiological agents of ARIs. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumoviruses (hMPVs), and human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) that are classified into the subfamilies Pneumovirinae and Paramyxovirinae and the Paramyxoviridae has a nonsegmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome, 1 which was the common causative agents of ARIs in humans in all age groups. [2] [3] [4] [5] These viruses can cause acute respiratory diseases such as croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia in children, the elderly, and immunodeficiency patients. RSV has two subtypes, subtype A and B, which play an important role in most respiratory infections and account for 60% to 80% of cases of bronchiolitis in children under 2 years of age. Followed by RSV, 5% to 15% of children with respiratory infections were hospitalized for bronchiolitis caused by hMPV. 6, 7 HPIVs have four subtypes including HPIV-1, HPIV-2, HPIV-3, and HPIV-4; HPIV-4 is considered less important. HPIV-1, HPIV-2, and HPIV-3 are prevalent in acute respiratory infections in children under 5 years and may account for 17% of hospitalizations. 5 RSV, hMPV, and HPIV infections can cause fever, cough, hypoxia, and severe symptoms such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. 4, 8, 9 Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish between RSV, hMPV, and HPIV infections, and accurate early diagnosis based on clinical manifestations is a serious challenge. 10 Early diagnosis is recognized as an important way to facilitate early management and combat ARIs. 11 Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can detect and quantify specific DNA or RNA in samples. It is widely used to detect respiratory viruses and provides an effective solution for early detection. 12, 13 Compared with traditional virus culture and immunofluorescence detection methods, real-time PCR has the advantages of high sensitivity, short turnaround time, and simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 682, "end": 685, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 686, "end": 689, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 690, "end": 693, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 694, "end": 697, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1155, "end": 1157, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1158, "end": 1159, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1412, "end": 1413, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1535, "end": 1537, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1538, "end": 1540, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1541, "end": 1542, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1711, "end": 1713, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1812, "end": 1814, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2017, "end": 2020, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2021, "end": 2023, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Unlike monoplex real-time PCR, multiplex real-time PCR allows multiple pathogens to be detected simultaneously in a single reaction, thus having the advantage of time savings and costeffective. 7, 14 At present, several monoplex or multiplex real-time RT-PCR methods for hMPV, RSV, and HPIVs detection have been established.

The RNA standard was quantified three times using the Nanodrop spectrophotometer 2000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). The number of copies per \u00b5L was calculated using the mean values and formula: RNA (g/\u00b5L)/ (length \u00d7 340) \u00d7 6.02 \u00d7 10 23 , where length was the number of nucleotides. Ten-fold dilutions equivalent to 10 1 to 10 7 copies/\u00b5L RNA were used to calculate the limit of detection of the triplex real-time RT-PCR. The commercially available QIAamp MinElute Virus Rotation Kit (Qiagen) was used for the extraction of DNA and RNA. A total of 80-\u00b5L total nucleic acids were extracted from 200-\u00b5L clinical specimen samples. Negative water controls were included in every run.

The following concentrations: 10 1 copies/\u00b5L were applied to determine the linearity of the triplex real-time RT-PCR. Three replicates were tested at each concentration in a single run. After amplification, the typical standard curves were plotted with cycle threshold (C t ) values on the vertical axis (Y-axis) and lg copies/\u00b5L on the horizontal axis (Xaxis), providing information on the amplification efficiency and the theoretical detection limits of the assay (Supporting Information Figure S1). The correlation coefficients R 2 , which measure the linearity of the regression, were all greater than 0.99 for hMPV, RSV-A, RSV-B, HPIV-1, HPIV-2, and HPIV-3 in each triplex real-time RT-PCR.

All the positive specimens in this study were further validated, based on nested RT-PCR and sequencing (data not shown). Furthermore, of the positive cases with human paramyxoviruses, 35 were infected with a single virus (composition ratio as 83.3%) and 7 showed coinfections (Table 2). The most common pattern of coinfection was double infection with HPIV-1 and HPIV-2 (3 cases) and triple infection with HPIV-1, HPIV-2, and RSV-A (3 cases). Single infection was common for RSV-A (11 cases).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF5": {"text": "| DISCUSSION hMPV, RSV, together with HPIVs, all belong to the Paramyxoviridae family which is classified as a Pneumovirinae subfamily and a Paramyxovirinae subfamily, and the Paramyxoviridae has nonsegmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genomes. 3,5 Their detection rate is high in ARIs, particularly in infants and children, which indicates their important clinical significance in acute respiratory illness. Multiplex real-time PCR is a fast, low-cost technique for diagnosing respiratory viral infections; however, few studies have attempted to use this method to quickly and simultaneously detect all six known common human paramyxoviruses, including the recently identified hMPV in settings. 10 Here, we developed a two-tube triplex real-time RT-PCR for the sensitivity of the assay, as primer-to-probe interactions may reduce the availability of specific primers. In addition, the presence of multiple targets in one reaction may result in competition for enzymes and nucleotides. 20 Analysis of hMPV, RSV, and HPIV RNA standards with dynamic ranges from 10 7 to 10 1 copies/\u00b5L showed no sensitivity reduction in our new trial. The standard curve showed that each virus performs well in the monoplex and triplex reactions, with the same detection limit from 300 to 425 copies virus gene per reaction, while the literature reported 5 to 500 copies of the virus gene (HPIV-1, HPIV-2, HPIV-3, RSV-A, and hMPV) or tissueculture infective dose of 0.34 (RSV-B). 1,15,16 Other curve parameters such as the R 2 and slope indicated good linearization and efficiency in the process of amplification. We assessed the CVs within intragroup and intergroup assays, which can reflect the degree of variation in data, and the results showed stable state intra and interexperiment reactions.In our study, HPIV-1, HPIV-2, and RSV-A were the predominant detection viruses, which were highly concordant with previous reports.3,14 A total of 7 of 42 cases had been simultaneously detected with coinfection of human paramyxoviruses in individual specimens, which confirmed the superiority of multiplex real-time RT-PCR for detecting coinfection.12,21 The C t value also suggested that different human paramyxoviruses in AFRS patients had different viral loads.
