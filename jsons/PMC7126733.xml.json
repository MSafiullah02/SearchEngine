The epidemic of emerging infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome [1] and highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) [2] and the threat of reemergence infectious diseases such as tuberculosis [3] and malaria [4] emphasize the importance of vaccination. One example of the global threat of infectious disease is the recent outbreak of new influenza A (H1N1), which was declared to have a phase 6 pandemic status by the World Health Organization in June 2009 [5]. The availability of novel vaccination methods is urgently needed at the outset of a pandemic or bioterrorism attack, because conventional injectable vaccination is associated with several problems such as pain, requirement for medical personnel or techniques, needle-related disease or injuries, and storage and transportation issues such as the need for a cold chain [6], [7]. Transcutaneous immunization (TCI) is an attractive vaccination method that eliminates these problems of injectable vaccination [8], [9].",

In particular, LCs have a critical role as potent antigen-presenting cells against external antigens. TCI must deliver antigenic proteins to the LCs in the epidermal layer to induce antigen-specific immune responses. This is difficult, however, because the stratum corneum provides a physical barrier to substance penetration [14], [15], [16]. Other transcutaneous vaccine delivery techniques like electroporation [17], [18] and iontophoresis [19], [20] include risks of inflammation and infection resulting from damage to the stratum corneum. In addition, these methods require large-size and specific equipment to use for vaccination. Therefore, an easy-to-use and safe TCI system must be developed for cost-effective and widely available vaccination.",

We demonstrated that LCs captured antigen proteins in the epidermal layer, and migrated to lymph nodes. We reported that the TCI formulation effectively induced the production of antigen-specific antibodies to several model antigens. In addition, a TCI formulation containing tetanus toxoid (TT) and diphtheria toxoid (DT) as practical antigens induced an immune response [22], and the toxoid-specific antibodies produced by this TCI formulation neutralized the tetanus and diphtheria toxins. Moreover, side effects were not observed in animal experiments, based on Draize scoring, pathologic examination, and blood tests. Thus, vaccination using our TCI formulation is not only effective but also safe, and we believe that this TCI system can be applied to humans.",

The Research Foundation for Microbial Diseases of Osaka University, Suita, Japan) in phosphate-buffered saline was dropped on the surface of a hydrogel patch (5 cm \u00d7 8 cm), and the water was absorbed under aseptic conditions. The hydrogel patch containing both TT and DT as a TCI formulation was applied to the left brachial medial skin of volunteers for 24 h and covered with wound protection film to allow for better skin adherence (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B summarizes the vaccination protocol using the TCI formulation. Twenty-four hours after application, the TCI formulation was removed from the investigational sites. Skin irritation reactions were scored according to the classification of the ICDRG to assess local adverse responses at 24 h and 48 h. A general peripheral blood test and biochemical tests of liver and renal function were performed at 0 h and 48 h to evaluate the presence of systemic adverse responses. In addition, the volunteers were interviewed to assess the presence of subjective symptoms. During this period, the volunteers were instructed to avoid any activity that might influence the investigational sites. Sixty days after application of the TCI formulation, serum was collected from all subjects to measure toxoid-specific antibody titers. In addition, a second vaccination in 5 subjects was administered 140 days after first vaccination using the same procedures. ICDRG scoring was performed on day 141 and 142, and a blood test was performed on day 140 and 142 to evaluate possible side effects induced by the second vaccination. To measure antibody production induced by the second vaccination, serum was collected on day 140 and 200. Moreover, to assess long-term vaccine effects, serum was collected from 6 subjects 365 days after the first vaccination.",

We also administered a second vaccination to 5 subjects in whom neither antibody titer was significantly increased by the first vaccination. The IgG titers increased in a part of subjects following the second vaccination, suggesting that an additional application increases the efficacy of the TCI formulation (Table 3\nand Fig. 4A and B). Antibody titers on day 365 after application of the TCI formulation were maintained at a higher level than those on day 0 in all subjects examined, although antibody titers tended to be lower on day 365 than on day 60 (Table 4\nand Fig. 4C and D). Moreover, to evaluate the toxin-neutralizing effects of the induced antibodies, we performed a passive-challenge experiment with tetanus toxin using the sera of 5 subjects whose antibody levels were increased by the first vaccination. The maximum dilution factor of sera that neutralized toxin on day 60 was higher than that on day 0 in all subjects examined (Table 5\n). Thus, the TCI formulation induced a protective immune response against bacterial toxin. Therefore, our TCI formulation appears to be applicable in humans based on the antibody production by single or multiple vaccinations, the long-term vaccine effect, and the toxin-neutralizing effect.",

Immediately after removing the TCI formulation, the water content in the stratum corneum near the skin surface (0\u20136 \u03bcm) was increased (Fig. 5A), suggesting that corneum hydration is associated with water-soluble antigen penetration of the skin. The water content returned to the level of untreated skin within 1 h after removing the TCI formulation. Natural moisturizing factor in the stratum corneum near the epidermal layer (6\u201310 \u03bcm) also slightly increased (Fig. 5B), although the reason for the increase is unclear. There were no critical changes on other skin components, such as cholesterol, t-urocanic acid (pH 4.0), t-urocanic acid (pH 8.0), urea, pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid, serine, or proline (data not shown), indicating that application of the TCI formulation had little adverse effect on skin. Moreover, the amount of glycerin, lactate acid, and ceramide increased in the stratum corneum near the skin surface following application of the TCI formulation (Fig. 5C\u2013E), suggesting that glycerin and octyldodecyl lactate which are components of the hydrogel patch penetrated the stratum corneum. The amount of change in the octyldodecyl lactate can be inferred from the lactate acid and ceramide levels, because octyldodecyl lactate consists of lactate acid and carbon chains, which are ceramide structures. Glycerin is a humectant, holding water in the skin and softening the skin [27]. Octyldodecyl lactate is an absorption enhancer that disrupts the lipid bilayer of the corneum and promotes the transmission or absorption of a material [28]. It is thus assumed that these components penetrating the stratum corneum act to enhance the delivery of antigen proteins into the skin. These data demonstrate that corneum swelling and disruption by application of the TCI formulation contribute to enhance the permeation of antigens into the stratum corneum.",

Although other groups have reported developing TCI systems for practical use [29], [30], these systems comprised a gauze patch as the TCI device. TCI systems using a gauze patch are inconvenient and require a cold storage and transportation for the antigen solution as well as a conventional injectable vaccination system, because these systems require that the gauze patch was saturated with antigen solution just before application to the skin. Additionally, safety is an issue in a TCI system using the gauze patch, because the stratum corneum must be disrupted for transcutaneous delivery of enough antigens to induce an immune response. On the other hand, in our system, we can prepare a manageable TCI formulation like general fomentations with a concentrated antigen layer on the surface of the hydrogel patch [21]. Our hydrogel patch is made of safe materials that are already applied to humans. In fact, the TCI formulation caused few severe side effects, and the toxoid-specific antibodies were produced in some subjects by a single application without removing the stratum corneum. Moreover, antibody titers were higher at 1 year after the first vaccination than that on day 0. The immune response is expected to be enhanced by several applications, because a second application of the TCI formulation increased the antibody titers in a part of subjects. Fifth vaccinations are recommended as standard for vaccine against tetanus and diphtheria toxoids [31], [32]. In several applications, this easy-to-use TCI system might be a better formulation than an injectable vaccination with regard to administration. We previously reported that the hydrogel patch promotes antigen penetration through the stratum corneum by causing corneum hydration in an animal experiment [23]. To clarify the mechanism of antigen permeation in humans, we analyzed the skin condition after applying the TCI formulation by using in vivo confocal Raman spectroscopy, and demonstrated that the water content in the stratum corneum increased immediately after patch application. In addition to hydration of the stratum corneum, some of the patch components (glycerin and octyldodecyl lactate) penetrated the stratum corneum. The humectation of the stratum corneum induced by the glycerin [27] and the disruption of the lipid bilayer induced by the octyldodecyl lactate [28] were likely associated with the antigen permeation. Unfortunately, although we planned to examine the antigen permeation of the stratum corneum, we were unable to obtain specific Raman spectra of TT or DT. We speculated that the TCI formulation delivered antigens to the LCs by changing the skin properties without destroying the stratum corneum as a physical barrier, because the immune response was actually induced by application of the TCI formulation. Therefore, we developed an easy-to-use TCI formulation to induce an immune response without severe side effects in humans.",

We thought that physical stimulation and an inflammatory reaction occurred. In other words, antigens penetrated the skin and induced an immune response to protect the body. One potential reason is that the immunocompetent cells were stimulated by the antigens penetrating the skin. In 10 subjects of the 13 subjects who reported skin irritation, either or both of the anti-TT and DT antibody titers on day 60 increased more than 0.1 IU/mL than that on day 0. Another potential reason is that the subjects already had antibodies against the antigens. Of these 13 subjects, 2 subjects had a high antibody titer against DT on day 0 (1.9 or 2.8 IU/mL). Thus, we inferred that the irritant responses to application of the TCI formulation are not simply side effects, but rather are indicative of immune responses or protective reactions against antigens penetrating the skin. Fever as a systemic symptom and flare or swelling as a local adverse event are observed with injectable vaccine [31], [32]. Because there was no group that was vaccinated by injection in this study, we did not directly compare adverse effects between injectable and transcutaneous vaccination. Based on the results of this study, we do not think that there are likely to be large differences between injectable and transcutaneous vaccination. Therefore, we believe that this TCI system will be able to overcome several of the problems in injectable vaccination and achieve safe and easy-to-use vaccination.",

            "text": "Antibody titers increased and a significant effect was detected by paired t-test. On the other hand, antibody titers in some subjects did not increase even after one or two applications. Almost subjects had already been vaccinated against tetanus and diphtheria as infants. We assumed that in these subjects an increase of the antibody titers was not induced by application of the TCI formulation because the antibody titers were already at their maximum level. Antibody titers greater than 0.1 IU/ml are reported to be necessary for prophylaxis for tetanus [31] or diphtheritic neuropathy [32]. On day 0, the anti-TT antibody titer was higher than 0.1 IU/ml in 19 subjects, and the anti-DT antibody titer was higher than 0.1 IU/ml in 26 subjects. Unfortunately, this explanation could not be confirmed because the vaccination histories of the subjects in this study were not collected. Antibody titers did not increase in 7 of 8 subjects in whom antibody titers were lower than 0.1 IU/ml before TCI application, although antibody titer of 1 subject increased more than 0.15 IU/ml. This suggests that TCI using a hydrogel patch induced little immune response as a primary vaccination. For this reason, we thought that antigens penetrating the skin were insufficient to induce an immune response. We have analyzed the antigen permeation in animal experiments, although we could not in human skin. A hydrogel patch containing 125I-labeled TT or DT was applied to rats, and the amount of antigen distributed to the stratum corneum and antigen penetrating the stratum corneum was calculated from the radioactivity using a gamma counter. The data indicated that the amount of antigen penetrating the skin was a few percent of the antigen applied to the skin [unpublished data], suggesting that the antigen-delivery amount by TCI formulation was small in humans. Additionally, there might be individual differences in the antigen penetration of the stratum corneum. Probably, the potency of the immune response likely differs individually. The current injectable vaccination contains aluminum salts as an adjuvant with few dozens of micrograms of the antigen. Adjuvants would enhance the immune response against antigens in the TCI system as well as in injection. Increasing antigen penetration into the skin or developing a transcutaneous adjuvant might improve the response rate. Moreover, costs may be cut by decreasing the antigen quantity used for the TCI. Studies are in progress to improve the antigen penetration by modifying the hydrogel patch and to develop a transcutaneous adjuvant to activate the immune system like toll-like receptor ligands.",

To analyze the role of LCs in detail, we are now investigating the characteristics of the immune response in transgenic mice, whose LCs or CD11c-positive cells can be depleted. Evaluation of how the TCI formulation impacts the Th1/Th2 balance in humans will help to define the characteristics of the TCI system, and to determine additional applications of the hydrogel patch. For example, our TCI system might be applicable for treating Th1-type autoimmune diseases by correcting the Th1/Th2 balance. Moreover, the hydrogel patch formulation has potential for a wide variety of applications, not only for vaccine/immunotherapy but also for drug delivery therapy in diseases such as atopic dermatitis.",

This easy-to-use TCI formulation might be applicable for mass treatment in the event of an outbreak and for increasing vaccination rates in developing countries.
