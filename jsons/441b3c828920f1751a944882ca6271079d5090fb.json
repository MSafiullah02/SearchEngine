However, the PBMC model draws more attention to the role of T-cell/macrophage interplay, which is highly relevant in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, and acknowledges the existing data on the role of the proinflammatory cytokine interferon-\u2425 in the process of atherogenesis and other inflammatory conditions. By inducing the depletion of antioxidant systems and causing oxidative stress, interferon-\u2425 is probably the most important trigger for the production of reactive oxygen species in macrophages (8 ), considered to be of utmost relevance in atherogenesis. Our in vitro PBMC system is fully in accordance with the notion that macrophage products should be measured, and it is valid both in vitro and in vivo. Both neopterin production and tryptophan degradation are induced by interferon-\u2425 in macrophages; thus, both reflect macrophage activity. In coronary heart disease, increases in neopterin concentrations not only correlate with tryptophan degradation (9 ) and with the activity of the disease (9 ), they also predict coronary events more sensitively than do methods such as the more widely used C-reactive protein measure-ments (10, 11 ) .

The alternative approach with PBMC preparations provides insight into signaling cascades, especially those initiated by T cells. The monitoring of biochemical effects such as neopterin formation and tryptophan degradation reveals more stable results in quantitative terms than does monitoring of cytokine production. Moreover, this strategy monitors the net effect of various pro-and antiinflammatory cascades initiated during stimulated immune response in vitro and in vivo and provides data on the influence of tested compounds on the whole cascade of events. Finally, both read-out systems seem particularly suited to testing for antiinflammatory effects of compounds because enhanced production of neopterin and accelerated degradation of tryptophan are closely related to the pathogenesis of various diseases in which inflammatory processes are involved.

Bearing in mind the above issues, we recently attempted to profile and compare the serum proteomes of 39 adult patients in the early stages of SARS infection and 39 adult non-SARS patients who were suspected cases during the SARS outbreak period (6 ).

Spearman rank correlation analysis showed that the normalized intensities of these 3 peaks correlated highly with the serum concentration values obtained by ELISA (all correlation coefficients \u03fe0.9; all P values \u03fd0.0005; Table 1 ).

In contrast to the previous SELDI studies, the normalized intensities of these 3 peaks were significantly lower in the adult SARS patients, instead of higher, Table 1 ). When analyzing the ELISA data, we found that the serum SAA concentrations were greatly increased in both the SARS and non-SARS patient groups. The mean serum SAA concentrations of the SARS and non-SARS patient groups were 40-and 85-fold higher than the upper limit of the reference interval (\u03fd10 mg/L), respectively.

It is hard to imagine why an uncertainty interval should not include all data and what such an uncertainty interval means when it is not based on all of the data. Maybe the authors assume that outliers are caused by blunders and that they wish to limit their uncertainty interval to the analytical process. Perhaps, but one cannot know that this assumption is true. Moreover, in the EURACHEM/ CITAC guide, there is a specific example in which an outlier is deleted because of an analytical root-cause error (an instrumentation problem).By use of nonparametric methods based on empirical distributions, uncertainty intervals can be estimated without deleting data (4 ). If these intervals are too large, one should try to discover root causes, not delete data.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "acknowledgement"}]}
