SARS-CoV belongs to a distinct group of known human coronaviruses, such as HCoV-229E (Group 1) and HCoV-OC43 (Group 2), which are only slightly pathogenic in humans. On the contrary, animal coronaviruses have been known to cause clinically serious diseases in livestock and pet animals. Based on the nucleotide sequence homology of SARS-CoV-like virus in wild animals traded in Chinese markets, it is considered that SARS-CoV emerged through the interspecies transmission of such animal coronaviruses (review in [3] ).

The S protein is divided into two regions, S1 (aa1-690) and S2 (aa691-1255), although it is not cleaved by a protease as other corona-viruses are. The S2 region contains a transmembrane and cytoplasmic region and the S1 contains the RBD. The S1 domain of Group-I coronaviruses, including human CoV-229E and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), recognises aminopeptidase N (CD13) as a cellular target molecule [25, 26] . The binding site was mapped to aa407-547 in the case of Hu-CoV 229E [27] and aa506-655 in TGEV [28] . Group-II coronaviruses, such as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), recognise the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM1) as a cellular receptor [29] , and the N-terminal 330aa residues contain the receptor binding site [30] . Upon binding to the target molecule, the S protein undergoes a conformational change leading to exposure of the fusogenic region in the S2 part resulting in membrane fusion between the viral and cellular membranes [31, 32] .
