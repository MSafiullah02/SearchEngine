Prevalence of FCV was 29.4% in clinically diseased cats (Abd-Eldaim et al., 2009), and 43.1% in cat population of a rescue shelter (Zicola et al., 2009). At present, vaccination is administered worldwide to prevent FCV infection in pet cats. However, new highly virulent FCV strains that cause systemic hemorrhagic disease and significant mortality up to 67% have recently been reported (Foley et al., 2006). Current vaccines may not protect against these new strains, highlighting the importance of antivirals (Radford et al., 2007). Sensitive methods for detecting FCV infection would be extremely useful to identify such inhibitors.",

            "text": "The FCV genome encodes three open reading frames (ORFs) of approximately 7.7 kb. The viral protease, encoded in ORF1, is initially synthesized as a part of the ORF1 polyprotein, and responsible for the cleavage among ORF1 proteins to generate functional non-structural proteins. This protease also functions to cleave an ORF2-encoded protein to generate the capsid protein VP1 (Clarke and Lambden, 2000, Sosnovtsev et al., 1998, Sosnovtsev et al., 2002). The FCV protease cleaves peptide bonds downstream of a specific glutamic acid (E) in the precursor protein (Green, 2007, Oka et al., 2009, Sosnovtsev et al., 1998, Sosnovtsev et al., 2002). This processing is essential for the formation of mature infectious virus particles (Sosnovtsev et al., 1998, Sosnovtsev et al., 2002). Therefore, FCV protease is an attractive target to develop anti-FCV inhibitors, and its activity can also be a useful marker of FCV infection and replication in cultured cells. At present, no FCV-specific growth inhibitor has been developed. However, ribavirin, a broad spectrum anti-virus compound, has been shown to inhibit FCV growth in cultured cells (Belliot et al., 2005, Povey, 1978b).",

The virus was propagated and titrated in CRFK cells with a conventional assay. Briefly, viral suspensions were fivefold serially diluted (5\u22121\u20135\u221210) in 100 \u03bcL of MEM medium, and then added to CRFK culture wells in 96-well plates (total volume of 200 \u03bcL/well). Eight wells were used per dilution. Cultures were maintained at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2, and after 3 days, the cytopathic effect was visualized by methylene-blue staining.

            "text": "The biosensors BRET2-FCV-Cut and -Uncut are based on the BRET2 principle. BRET2 uses a luciferase (RLuc) isolated from the sea pansy Renilla reniformis as the donor, and a GFP variant (GFP2) as the acceptor (Fig. 4a). The energy transfer efficiencies between RLuc and GFP2, upon DeepBlueC addition, were determined ratiometrically by dividing the intensity of the acceptor emission by that of the donor emission. This ratiometric measurement is referred to as the BRET2 signal and reflects the proximity of RLuc to GFP2 (Pfleger and Eidne, 2006). The FCV protease recognition sequence, PLFRLE/ADDGSI, was inserted between the donor and acceptor of a BRET2 pair (Fig. 4b). As a negative control, a construct containing a mutant cleavage motif (PLFRLA/ADDGSI) that cannot be cleaved by the FCV protease was also generated (Fig. 4b). When the FCV protease cleaves the recognition sequence, the GFP2 and RLuc proteins drift away from each other, and the energy transfer to GFP2 is lost (Fig. 4a). CRFK cells expressing BRET2-FCV-Cut and BRET2-FCV-Uncut showed a BRET2 ratio of approximately 1.0 without FCV infection, whereas CRFK cells expressing BRET2-FCV-Cut exhibited declining BRET2 ratios (GFP2/RLuc) of 0.22, 0.48, and 0.82 when FCV infection was performed at MOIs of 1, 0.1, and 0.01, respectively (Fig. 5a). In contrast, CRFK cells expressing the BRET2-FCV-Uncut showed no detectable BRET2 signal change regardless of MOI (Fig. 5a). The expression of BRET2-FCV-Cut and -Uncut proteins in the cells, and a cleaved GFP2 product generated in BRET2-FCV-Cut-expressing cells were confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 5b). These results demonstrate that the BRET2-FCV-Cut-expressing CRFK cell line is useful for detecting the protease activity after FCV infection.",
