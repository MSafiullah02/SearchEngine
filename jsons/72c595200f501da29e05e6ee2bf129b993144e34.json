Among them, indomethacin, an anti-inflammatory drug, was shown to have potent in-vitro antiviral properties on human SARS-CoV-1, canine CCoV, and more recently on human SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar range. Our objective was to show that indomethacin could be considered as a promising candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and to provide criteria for comparing benefits of alternative dosage regimens using a model-based approach. A multi-stage model-based approach was developed to characterize % of recovery and viral load in CCoV-infected dogs, to estimate the PK of indomethacin in dog and human using published data after administration of immediate (IR) and sustained-release (SR) formulations, and to estimate the expected antiviral activity as a function of different assumptions on the effective exposure in human. Different dosage regimens were evaluated for IR formulation (25 mg and 50 mg threetimes-a-day, and 25 mg four-times-a-day), and SR formulation (75 mg once and twice-a-day). The best performing dosing regimens were: 50 mg three-times-a-day for the IR formulation, and 75 mg twice-a-day for the SR formulation. The treatment with the SR formulation at the dose of 75 mg twice-a-day is expected to achieve a complete response in three days for the treatment in patients infected by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. These results suggest that indomethacin could be considered as a promising candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 whose potential therapeutic effect need to be further assessed in a prospective clinical trial.",

Among these treatments, indomethacin (INDO), a potent anti-inflammatory and antipyretic drug acting on COX1/2 enzymes, developed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in the 1960s [1, 2] seems to have the potential to become an effective treatment for the patients infected with SARS CoV-2. INDO can be used not only for its antipyretic properties, common to other non-steroidal analgesic drugs, as symptomatic treatment [3, 4] , but also to improve oxygenation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [5, 6] and to robustly reduce proinflammatory interleukin-6 levels [7, 8] .",

The % of recovery in dog was assumed to be driven by the time during which the exposure remained above an effective concentration value. Finally, the human PK following IR and SR formulations was derived from published data and a translational model was developed for estimating the clinical response in human based on the expected time during which the human exposure remained above the effective concentration following different dosage regimens.

Among the limitations that could affect the assessment of the INDO effect: (1) The in-vitro test showed that INDO had a directly and potently antiviral activity against the SARS CoV-2 pseudovirus and not on the SARS Cov-2 virus. The pseudovirus model that contains the SARS-CoV-2 spike was used to study the S/receptor interactions and this test is not necessarily indicative of an effect on virus replication;",
