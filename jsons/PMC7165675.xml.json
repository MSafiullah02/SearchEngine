Indeed, constipation features in James Parkinson's essay [1]. In IP, frequency of defecation begins to deviate from that of controls three decades before the median age of neurologic diagnosis, two before diagnosis of the first quartile of probands [16]: a finding upheld prospectively by the association of infrequent bowel movements and subsequent diagnosis of parkinsonism [17]. In IP, there is loss of, and damage to, colonic myenteric dopaminergic neurones. These, enteric plexus ganglia and physiologically related sympathetic neurones can contain Lewy bodies, as does the dorsal vagal nucleus [18, 19, 20]. Pfeiffer, thinking on similar but noninfective lines, homes in on constipation as a marker of the genesis of IP [20].",

By 2005, we had proof of principle that infection contributes to IP, through case studies of anti\u2010Helicobacter therapy in gastritis, with and without associated Helicobacter [22], and a hypothesis\u2010testing study [23]. In essence, \u201cmalignant\u201d IP appeared converted to \u201cbenign\u201d following successful eradication, but marked deterioration accompanied failure. In cases of late IP, eradicating Helicobacter produced U\u2010turns in both parkinsonism and cachexia [22]. In probands receiving no or only stable long\u2010t1/2 antiparkinsonian medication, the randomized efficacy study contrasted effect, on the time course of IP facets, of 1 week's successful anti\u2010H. pylori therapy against placebo, and against failure [23]. Improvement in the primary outcome, mean stride length at free\u2010walking speed, followed successful blinded active therapy (de\u2010blinding being scheduled for 1 year post\u2010randomization). Benefit on brady/hypokinesia did not fall off during the year after de\u2010blinding, and was echoed in those given open\u2010active anti\u2010H. pylori therapy subsequent to placebo [23]. Improvement was irrespective of whether patients were yet receiving background antiparkinsonian medication. Figure 1 illustrates that gait can improve dramatically following H. pylori eradication therapy where biopsies are molecular microbiology positive but culture negative (and there is no evidence of SIBO or other infection) [24]. \u201cLow\u2010density\u201d infection may be sufficient to perpetuate autoimmunity. Persistence even at this level of detection appeared detrimental [23].",

Immunoblot positivity is directly related to the blood lymphocyte count, lymphopenia, a feature of IP [23, 26].

Sixty percent of our probands, without current Helicobacter infection, are lactulose\u2010hydrogen breath test positive for SIBO.

In younger people, the prevalence of urea breath test positivity is falling (associated with better hygiene/increased exposure to antimicrobials), as is incidence and age\u2010specific mortality of IP [32]. However, transient H. pylori infection or persistence in low density may be sufficient to trigger/perpetuate autoimmunity, thereby setting the scene for the age\u2010specific increase in IP in older people [32].",

Whilst local brain inflammation does not usually signal out [34], systemic inflammation can communicate with the brain's immune system [33, 35]. Communication involving immune cells, antibody, or inflammatory products can occur where the blood brain barrier is naturally deficient, or when permeability is increased by circulating cytokines and cortisol. Peripheral afferent nerve stimulation, including vagal, can activate microglia (brain's resident macrophages) [35]. Helicobacter infection could stimulate the vagus, SIBO perhaps more so. Peripheral infection would increase traffic and signaling into brain. The substantia nigra is regarded as particularly vulnerable to everyday insults, such as products of dopamine oxidation [36]. Its homeostatic mechanisms function at full stretch. Nigral glial activation would increase stress, and recruit immune cells locally.",

They are found among normal mitochondria in IP probands with current or recent H. pylori infection. Our electron microscopists had not previously observed similar bodies, although two examples were found subsequently in archived duodenal biopsies from patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV can be associated with parkinsonian features [40]. There is an isolated report of similar mitochondrial inclusions in cerebral neurones in Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob\u2010like disease [41].
