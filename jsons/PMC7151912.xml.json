            "text": "Adverse reactions to interferon and ribavirin in the treatment of hepatitis C infection have been reviewed [9]. Since ribavirin is almost always used in combination with interferons, it can be difficult to know whether adverse events, if drug-induced, are due to one or the other. In many cases authors do not even discuss this problem, often attributing the supposed adverse reactions to the interferon. In some cases withdrawal of one of the agents can provide evidence, and in other cases there may be other clues. For example, in cases of skin pigmentation at the site of injection of interferons, the adverse reaction may be presumed to be due to interferon [10], a type II between-the-eyes adverse reaction [11]. In one case hemolytic anemia was attributed to interferon rather than ribavirin because the patient had previously taken a course of interferon without adverse reactions [12]; presumably the inference was that the patient had been sensitized by the previous course. A systematic review of cases in which the drugs were used together and individually can also yield useful information, as in the case of pneumonitis in patients being treated with interferon and ribavirin, attributed to interferon [13]. Similarly, in cases of ocular myasthenia [14], pleural effusion [15], and cataract [16] the interferon was blamed because no previous cases were found in association with ribavirin alone. In cases in which the adverse event persists for some time after the withdrawal of pegylated interferon and ribavirin, the long half of peginterferon is cited as a possible explanation, but this is weak evidence in such cases. In some cases it may be impossible to tell whether the adverse event, if drug-induced, was due to one or other of the drugs or to the combination.",

Patients with a sustained virological response (SVR) had a significantly more pronounced mean log10 decline from baseline in HCV RNA amounts at weeks 1 and 4 compared with patients who failed to achieve a sustained response, whereas there was no difference after day 1. For patients with a 2 log10 reduction in HCV RNA amounts on day 7, the positive predictive value for a sustained virological response was 92%, whereas week 12 was the best time point for predicting a later non-response in patients who failed to achieve a 2 log10 fall. In patients with genotype non-1 and a 2 log10 fall in HCV RNA amounts the positive predictive value for a sustained virological response was 89% at week 1, and 79% at weeks 4 and 12. The corresponding negative predictive values for patients with genotype non-1 were 43%, 40%, and 100% respectively. Of the 60 patients, one withdrew from treatment after the second dose of pegylated interferon alfa-2a, four withdrew prematurely, one each at treatment weeks 8, 12, and 27 for unknown reasons, and one at week 16 for psychiatric reasons. One other patient withdrew at week 16 because of arthralgia. Dosage reduction was required in three patients because of thrombocytopenia or neutropenia, and in three others the dosage of ribavirin was reduced because of anemia.",

Several SNPs were strongly associated with the fall in hemoglobin, including the non-synonymous SNP rs1127354. Another SNP, the splicing variant-related rs7270101, was not polymorphic in the Japanese population. Stratified analysis based on the rs1127354 genotype showed that inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase expression does not correlate with the fall in hemoglobin, suggesting that rs1127354 is a direct causal variant in the Japanese population.",

One patient with generalized eczematous skin changes eventually developed malar hypertrichosis lanuginosa and bullous skin lesions with milia on the backs of both hands, leading to a diagnosis of porphyria cutanea tarda; one patient developed a bullous eruption with histological features of acantholytic dermatitis with a non-specific immunohistological profile.",

In two patients in whom azathioprine metabolites were measured, myelotoxicity was accompanied by raised total methylated metabolite concentrations and reduced 6-tioguanine nucleotide concentrations. Pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin were withdrawn and the full blood count returned to normal. There was no recurrence when peginterferon was reintroduced with ribavirin or azathioprine alone. The authors concluded that the combination of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitors with purine analogues should be avoided. Another similar case has been reported [130].",

The pre-treatment hemoglobin was 14.3 g/dl. There was a good therapeutic response, but the hemoglobin fell firstly to 11.2 g/dl and then to 9.4 g/dl by week 42. This prompted a reduction in the dosage of ribavirin to 800 mg/day, and the hemoglobin rose to 11.8 g/dl. The antiviral therapy was withdrawn at week 48 and reintroduced 3 months later for a relapse. He was given subcutaneous peginterferon alfa-2a (180 micrograms/week) and oral ribavirin 1200 mg/day plus subcutaneous epoetin alfa 4000 U/week to prevent anemia and therefore the need to reduce the dose of ribavirin. Serum hemoglobin at the start of the second course of therapy was 14.7 g/dl and it remained stable throughout the first 12 weeks of therapy. However, at week 16, there was an abrupt fall in hemoglobin from 14.6 to 8.5 g/dl. The ribavirin was immediately withdrawn, the dosage of peginterferon was reduced, and the dosage of epoetin alfa was increased to 60 000 U/week. At week 18, the hemoglobin fell to 7.2 g/dl and the peginterferon was withdrawn. At week 20, the hemoglobin reached a nadir of 5.6 g/dl, requiring transfusion with three units of packed erythrocytes. The patient continued to require about one unit of blood every week despite continuing epoetin alfa, which was finally stopped at week 26. Erythropoietin antibodies became detectable by week 12 and peaked at week 24. Danazol 200 mg bd then 400 mg bd was started 8 weeks after the withdrawal of epoetin alfa. The hemoglobin then became stable at 9\u201310 g/dl for 24 weeks.\n",
