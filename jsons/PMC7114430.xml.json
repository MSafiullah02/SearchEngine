The causative agent, CSF virus (CSFV), is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded positive-sense genomic RNA that is classified as a member of the Pestivirus genus within the Flaviviridae family (Becher et al., 2003). The CSFV genome contains 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTRs) and a single large open reading frame encoding four structural and eight nonstructural (NS) proteins (Sheng et al., 2012). An internal ribosome entry site (IRES) located in the 5\u2032 UTR regulates the translation of the viral genome (Fletcher and Jackson, 2002).",

Viral detection by cell sensors initiates a cascade of events that induces the transcription of IFN and other cytokines, shuts down protein synthesis and induces cell death in the cell's first line of defense to limit viral replication. PKR protein is IFN-induced gene that is present in all vertebrates. It is activated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) which is often a by-product of virus replication. Recent studies have found that CSFV has evolved mechanisms to inhibit IFN production in infected cells, and preventing dsRNA-mediated apoptosis, which gives rise to long-term infections (Bauhofer et al., 2007, Ruggli et al., 2005, Ruggli et al., 2009, Seago et al., 2007, Seago et al., 2010); however, the role of PKR in CSFV infection has not been elucidated.",

PKR binds to dsRNA and undergoes auto-phosphorylation, which activates the kinase that phosphorylates eIF2\u03b1 at Ser51, thereby inhibiting translation initiation and protein synthesis in various types of viral infection (Cole, 2007, Garcia et al., 2006).

Rotavirus infection can induce PKR activation, eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, and the modification of the cellular translation machinery while circumventing the host immune response. The phosphorylation of eIF2a has been shown to block translation initiation of most cellular proteins without affecting viral replication (Lopez and Arias, 2012, Rojas et al., 2010). In hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected cells, PKR activation may be advantageous to the virus owing to reduced IFN production and consequent suppression of major histocompatibility complex I expression. In addition, PKR is responsible for the resistance of HCV to IFN treatment (Arnaud et al., 2010, Arnaud et al., 2011, Garaigorta and Chisari, 2009, Kang et al., 2014). In the Flaviviridae family, activated PKR was found to inhibit infection by West Nile virus (WNV) but not by dengue virus (Jiang et al., 2010).",

Despite many studies, the function of PKR in CSFV infection is still unknown. In the present study, we investigated whether CSFV infection can activate PKR and eIF2\u03b1, and examined the role of PKR in this process. The effect of PKR on CSFV replication and IFN induction was assessed by over-expressing or inhibiting PKR. Our results show that CSFV infection leads to activation of PKR and eIF2\u03b1 and enhances viral replication.",

However, it was not known whether PKR and eIF2\u03b1 were activated in CSFV infection. The phosphorylation status of eIF2\u03b1 and its kinase PKR during CSFV infection was assessed by infecting PK-15 cells with CSFV at various MOIs and analyzing cell extracts 24 hpi by Western blotting. The phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and PKR increased dose-dependently (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 5), and was detected as early as 24 hpi (Fig. 1B, lanes 1\u20136) upon CSFV infection (MOI = 1). CSFV NS3 protein level increased continuously upon eIF2\u03b1 activation. To determine whether eIF2\u03b1 and PKR activation was viral replication-dependent, cells were infected with UV-inactivated CSFV and eIF2\u03b1 and PKR phosphorylation was assessed. In treated cells, eIF2\u03b1 and PKR phosphorylation levels were close to the detection limit (Fig. 1A, lanes 6\u201310). These findings indicate that CSFV infection triggers the phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2\u03b1.",

IFN-\u03b2 levels were elevated in cultures of 2-AP- and PKR shRNA-treated cells, and was further increased by co-treatment with poly(I:C) (Fig. 6C and D).

            "text": "In the course of evolution, viruses have acquired numerous mechanisms to evade or subvert key elements of the host viral response. eIF2\u03b1 mediated translational control is the most important antiviral mechanism of PKR. The cap-dependent mechanism of translation initiation requires multiple eIFs and consists of two stages: the formation of the 48S initiation complex \u2013 for which eIF2 is required \u2013 and subsequent incorporation of the 60S subunit. When the \u03b1 subunit of the eIF2 is phosphorylated, eIF2\u2013GDP does not recycle to eIF2\u2013GTP and cellular translation is inhibited (Pestova et al., 2008, Sarnow, 2003). To overcome the inhibitory effects of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, viruses either inhibit the activation of the eIF2\u03b1 kinases, e.g., adenovirus and hepatitis C virus (Gale et al., 1998, Schneider et al., 1985), or enhance the dephosphorylation rate of eIF2\u03b1, e.g., herpes simplex1 virus and coronavirus (He et al., 1997, Wang et al., 2009). However, in some cases, viral protein synthesis can proceed under conditions of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylated as has been observed for HCV and rotaviruses. CSFV belongs to this last group, Interestingly, CSFV has a highly structured IRES that can associate with phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 and deliver Met-tRNA to the P site of a 40S ribosomal subunit to form the 48S initiation complex (Friis et al., 2012, Hashem et al., 2013, Jackson et al., 2010, Locker et al., 2007, Pestova et al., 2008).",

            "text": "In this work, we found that PKR and eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation was enhanced and eIF2\u03b1 was shuttled from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in CSFV-infected cells. However, the expression of viral proteins increased, suggesting that viral protein synthesis was insensitive to the inhibitory effects of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1. It was observed that the localization of eIF2\u03b1 and viral NS5A proteins partially overlapped. NS5A is an essential component of the viral RNA replication machinery, interacting with the 3\u2032 UTR of viral RNA and regulating its synthesis (Sheng et al., 2012). It is therefore possible that cytoplasmic eIF2\u03b1 is involved in the translation of CSFV RNA during infection. Consistent with these results, CSFV replication was enhanced in PKR over-expressing-cells, as evidenced by virus title and increased viral RNA and protein levels. Conversely, PKR inhibition by 2-AP or shRNA decreased CSFV replication. PKR activation induces nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB translocation which in turns increases IFN-\u03b2 production (Gil et al., 1999, Stewart et al., 2003). PKR is activated in CSFV-infected PK-15 cells while IFN transcription was unaltered. In addition, CSFV failed to activate NF-\u03baB both in vivo and in vitro (Chen et al., 2012a, Chen et al., 2012b). While inhibiting of PKR enhanced IFN expression, likely because PKR reduction decreased CSFV replication, thereby alleviating the inhibition of IFN induction. In this study, PKR was found mediate CSFV-induced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, since this was blocked by PKR depletion. Conversely, PKR activation promoted CSFV replication. MX1, an IFN-induced antiviral protein, strongly inhibited CSFV replication while it is not normally expressed in CSFV-infected cells (He et al., 2014). Suppressing PKR restored MX1 expression. These results suggest that CSFV infection triggers PKR and eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, which inhibits cellular protein synthesis, disrupts the host innate immune response, and ultimately enhances viral replication and reduces IFN-\u03b2 induction.",

Thus, there may be other mechanisms underlying the effect of PKR on CSFV replication. For instance, PKR also induces autophagy, which promotes CSFV replication (Pei et al., 2014). We found that PKR depletion inhibited CSFV induced autophagy (data not shown). On the other hand, viral components may have the capacity to regulate PKR: HCV NS5A interacts directly with PKR, which regulates HCV replication in conjunction with the HCV IRES (Gale et al., 1998, He et al., 2001, Toroney et al., 2010), In addition, Japanese encephalitis virus NS2A had been shown to block PKR (Tu et al., 2012), while PKR is not activated in WNV-infected rodent cells (Elbahesh et al., 2011). Whether similar mechanisms exist in CSFV will be the subject of future investigations.",

PKR over-expression enhanced CSFV replication, while PKR inhibition resulted in reduced CSFV replication. Moreover, PKR depletion enhanced the expression of IFN and consequently increased the expression of the IFN-induced antiviral effector protein MX1. These results indicate that CSFV utilizes PKR/eIF2\u03b1 signaling pathway enhances survival while evading the host immune response. These findings can explain why CSFV infection is persistent and characterized by low IFN levels.",
