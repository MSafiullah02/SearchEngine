Most diseases, except hypertensive renal disease, showed a higher prevalence in the control group compared to the case group (Table   1 ). This suggested that more tests for COVID-19 were done in people at risk of febrile respiratory illness regardless of COVID-19 pandemic [8] [9] [10] . Therefore, we presumed that the negative association in univariate analysis related to COVID-19 occurrence was based on biased baseline demographics and found that this selection bias was alleviated in the multivariate analysis ( Figure 3 ). Moreover, we compared the laboratory confirmed case to the RT-PCR negative control groups, and conducted subpopulation analysis according to high regional outbreak areas where this bias would have been less affected. As a result, the comorbidities that increased the risk of diagnosis of COVID-19 were more meaningful. Thus, we found that Cushing syndrome, chronic renal diseases, anemia, bone marrow dysfunction, diabetes with complications, and solid organ malignancy might be risk factors for the .

Substance use and schizophrenia also showed a significant increasing risk of severe COVID-19; however, this may be caused by the low socio-economic status. Chronic upper respiratory disease appeared to be a risk factor for severe disease only in the community outbreak area, and decreased the risk in the other region. Lack of medical resources in the place where community outbreak occurred, led to denied proper medical management in patients with early respiratory symptoms, therefore increasing their risk for severe disease. In contrast, the patients who lived in the non-high regional outbreak area received proper management of their upper respiratory symptoms in the early phase of disease [19, 20] . For the same reason it might explain that the increased risk of presence of COVID-19 and the decreased risk of severe disease showed in patient with ESRD who received regular dialysis treatment.

Thus, the database including those who were tested via \"Drive Through\" or local health centers and treated in non-medical facility was not included in this study. Therefore, the number of officially announced population was different from that of the analyzed population, which was used in this study. Despite this limitation, this study was conducted only for those who performed the laboratory test for COVID-19 on insurance claims database. Therefore, the negative control group had a confirmed a negative result of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, the comparison between this negative control group and case group helped in proper evaluation of the risk factors for COVID 19 occurrence. Another limitation was the inability of the data source to provide the information on the severity of the comorbidities. Finally, we could not evaluate the detailed mechanism of the relationship between comorbidities and the diagnosis or .
