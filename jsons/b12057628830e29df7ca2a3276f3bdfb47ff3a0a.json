The vision of establishing programs that focus on emerging infectious disease detection and response evolved into what are now called Global Disease Detection (GDD) Regional Centers. The GDD program was established in 2004 to provide support for the CDC's international programs and was expanded to include the IEIP and other programs as part of the GDD Regional Centers when CDC's Center for Global Health was established in 2010 [1] . The GDD Program builds global capacity to identify and respond to emerging diseases, and to conduct applied public health research on disease prevention and control [2] . The GDD Centers include 6 programs that support their host countries in building capacity to comply with the Revised International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) . The 3 core programs are the International Emerging Infections Program, the cornerstone of the GDD Centers that serves as a platform to study emerging diseases and their prevention and control; the Field Epidemiology Training Program, which trains scientists in applied epidemiology and public health laboratory science; and the Influenza Program, which supports detection and response for seasonal and pandemic influenza. The remaining 3 GDD programs include the One Health Program, integrating animal and human health investigations of zoonotic diseases; the Strengthening Laboratory Capacity Program; and the RiskCommunicationandEmergencyResponseProgram, supporting health communication and helping countries establish infrastructure for Emergency Operations Centers and systems.

In contrast, in Kenya, where healthcare utilization-even for cases of severe illness-is low both in urban [5] and rural [6] areas, a community-based system was established. This system consists of biweekly household visits during which information about illness is collected for all household members, and patients with serious illness are referred to the study clinic where more detailed clinical information and specimens are collected. Because hospital-based systems are relatively inexpensive to operate [7] , they can cover large populations. In a community-based system with household visits, large population sizes would require resources beyond those available for conducting population-based surveillance. Large hospitalbased systems provide more capacity to detect emerging pathogens and provide larger sample sizes for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions. Rigorous community-based systems provide greater opportunities to evaluate transmission rates, determinants, and risk factors for common diseases, and sometimes yield incidence rates inclusive of more disease episodes; however, the smaller surveillance area limits the ability to fully define the spectrum of illness caused by particular pathogens.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 258, "end": 261, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 262, "end": 264, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 466, "end": 469, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 480, "end": 483, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 868, "end": 871, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 137, "end": 145, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "HISTORY AND MISSION OF THE GLOBAL DISEASE DETECTION (GDD) INTERNATIONAL EMERGING INFECTIONS PROGRAM (IEIP)"}, {"text": "Although subtle differences in the acute respiratory illnesses tracked in the IEIP population-based surveillance exist, sites generally start by capturing acute respiratory infections (ARIs) as defined by evidence of acute infection (typically fever or abnormal white blood cell count) plus 1 or more signs or symptoms of Surveillance for Respiratory Infections \u2022 JID 2013:208 (Suppl 3) \u2022 S169 respiratory illness (Table 2 ). Most sites also track subsets of ARI cases: influenza-like illness among outpatients; severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) among hospitalized patients, and pneumonia, which may apply to outpatients or inpatients ( Table 2 ).

In Kenya, acute and convalescent sera have been tested by serology for influenza viruses, RSV, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza viruses in a special study to evaluate the additional diagnostic yield of serology for respiratory pathogens in addition to PCR [9] . In the event of an apparently newly introduced pathogen, such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), these banked sera could be used to assess the extent of disease by evaluating the seroprevalence of antibodies or seroincidence of infection, as well as evaluating whether the pathogen was circulating previously without detection. In Thailand, paired sera have been tested for M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, Legionella longbeachae, and Coxiella burnetii; in Bangladesh, paired sera have been tested for respiratory pathogens from patients with fever and/or ARI and acute lower respiratory infection.

Among IEIP sites with published data, a high incidence of RSV disease has been consistently demonstrated.

These differences are partially due to site-specific differences in local laboratory capacity, standards of clinical care, limitations in the use, quality, and interpretation of routine diagnostics (eg, blood cultures and chest radiographs), and healthcare-seeking behaviors of the population under surveillance. A universal challenge is the aseptic collection of blood for culture and adequate capacity for processing. Because of the challenges of implementing blood culture, estimates of invasive bacterial infections, particularly bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia, are uncertain. However, some sites, such as Bangladesh and Kenya, have successfully incorporated blood culture into their surveillance, enabling measurement of the proportion of invasive pneumococcal disease that may be prevented with use of newly developed conjugate vaccines [20] and documenting that blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever can be associated with significant respiratory manifestations [21] . Investigators in the GDD Regional Center in Thailand found that prior use of antibiotics (measured by serum antimicrobial drug levels) reduced the incidence estimates for pneumococcal bacteremia by 32% overall and 39% in children <5 years of age [22] . Because specimens are archived from patients with acute respiratory illness in the GDD IEIP programs with established respiratory surveillance sites, it is possible to rapidly characterize the incidence and epidemiology of newly identified pathogens (eg, pandemic A[H1N1]2009) [23] [24] [25] and to reexamine disease burden estimates when new, more sensitive and highly specific tests become available. Thus, the novel MERS-CoV first identified in 2012 among patients in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Jordan [26] [27] [28] can be examined as a cause of respiratory illness by testing prospective as well as archived samples from IEIP surveillance sites run by the GDD Regional Center in Egypt and other GDD Centers, surveillance sites run by other GDD programs (eg, Influenza, One Health, and Refugee Health), and affiliated surveillance networks (eg, the Eastern Mediterranean Acute Respiratory Infections Surveillance (EMARIS) sites established by the GDD Regional Center in Egypt, the World Health Organization's Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office, and its member states). Likewise, the sites are well poised to evaluate new diagnostic testing technologies, including multiple pathogen assays like the TaqMan array card (TAC), which tests for a variety of pathogens with one specimen [29] . Technologies like TAC allow archived specimens collected over multiple years to be tested at one time, presenting the possibility to rapidly characterize a vast array of ARI etiologies in multiple geographic locations with varied ecologic and demographic features.

This multicountry network of populationbased surveillance sites provides a platform to test a variety of interventions in settings where ecology, economics, ethnicity, politics, predominant co-morbidities and co-infecting pathogens, and behavior vary, thereby providing a useful tool to design optimal intervention strategies targeted to each setting. GDD IEIP surveillance data also provides a stimulus for more urgent development of novel vaccines and therapeutics for RSV and other diseases by demonstrating their burden and severity and are poised to assess the effectiveness, acceptance, and value of these tools compared with other prevention strategies. Given the consistency in laboratory testing methods, the approach to surveillance of respiratory infections undertaken by GDD IEIP sites enables comparison of the burden of RSV disease and its epidemiology among the 6 geographically and sociopolitically diverse countries. Longitudinal surveillance data from these sites, combined with those from GDD Influenza Program sites, will add to the global understanding of RSV-associated mortality and risk factors for severe disease and death in low-and middleincome countries, result in better descriptions of RSV seasonality, and inform intervention strategies to mitigate the burden of RSV-associated disease. The IEIP-run surveillance sites are well positioned to serve as platforms for future RSV vaccine efficacy or effectiveness studies in low-and middle-income countries, and to evaluate the utility and feasibility of RSV prophylaxis in these settings. Ultimately, the evidence generated by studies from GDD IEIP surveillance sites can inform countries' determinations of their public health priorities and generate the political will to implement effective prevention and control measures, through evidence-based policy change.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CONCLUSIONS"}, {"text": "Notes", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CONCLUSIONS"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "A comparison of populationbased pneumonia surveillance and health-seeking behavior in two provinces in rural Thailand", "authors": [{"first": "H", "middle": ["T"], "last": "Jordan", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": [], "last": "Prapasiri", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": [], "last": "Areerat", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2009, "venue": "Int J Infect Dis", "volume": "13", "issn": "", "pages": "355--61", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Putting surveillance data into context: the role of health care utilization surveys in understanding population burden of pneumonia in developing countries", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Deutscher", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Van Beneden", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "Burton", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2012, "venue": "J Epidemiol Global Health", "volume": "2", "issn": "", "pages": "73--81", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "Healthcare-use for major infectious disease syndromes in an informal settlement in Nairobi", "authors": [{"first": "R", "middle": ["F"], "last": "Breiman", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "B", "middle": [], "last": "Olack", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Shultz", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2011, "venue": "Kenya.
