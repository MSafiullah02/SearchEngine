Thus, it is critical that objects that enter sterile tissue or the vascular system be sterile because any microbial contamination could result in disease transmission. This category includes surgical instruments, cardiac and urinary catheters, and implants used in sterile body cavities. The items in this category should be purchased as sterile or be sterilized by steam sterilization if possible. If heat sensitive, the object may be treated with ethylene oxide (ETO), hydrogen peroxide (HP) gas plasma, vaporized HP, HP vapor (HPV) plus ozone, or by liquid chemical sterilants if other methods are unsuitable. Table 1 and Tables 2 and 3\nlist sterilization processes and liquid chemical sterilants and the advantages and disadvantages of each. With the exception of 0.2% peracetic acid (12 minutes at 50\u00b0C\u201356\u00b0C), the indicated exposure times for liquid chemical sterilants range from 3 to 12 hours.19 Liquid chemical sterilants can be relied on to produce sterility only if cleaning, which eliminates organic and inorganic material, precedes treatment and if proper guidelines as to concentration, contact time, temperature, and pH are met. Another limitation to sterilization of devices with liquid chemical sterilants is that the devices cannot be wrapped during processing in a liquid chemical sterilant; thus, it is impossible to maintain sterility following processing and during storage. Furthermore, devices may require rinsing following exposure to the liquid chemical sterilant with water that, in general, is not sterile. Therefore, because of the inherent limitations of using liquid chemical sterilants in a nonautomated (or automated) reprocessor, their use should be restricted to reprocessing critical devices that are heat sensitive and incompatible with other sterilization methods.",

This low (or nonexistent) margin of safety associated with endoscope reprocessing compares with the 17-log10 margin of safety associated with cleaning and sterilization of surgical instruments (ie, 12-log10 reduction via sterilization and at least a net 5-log10 reduction based on the microbial load on surgical instruments [2-logs]27 and microbial reduction via a washer disinfector [7-logs]).18\n",

Staff should receive training on the safe use and reprocessing of the equipment and be competency tested. At the University of North Carolina (UNC) Hospitals, to ensure patient-safe instruments, all staff that reprocess semicritical instruments (eg, instruments which contact a mucous membrane such as vaginal probes, endoscopes, prostate probes) are required to attend a 3-hour class on HLD of semicritical instruments. The class includes the rationale for and importance of high-level disinfection, discussion of high-level disinfectants and exposure times, reprocessing steps, monitoring minimum effective concentration, personal protective equipment, and the reprocessing environment (establish dirty-to-clean flow). Infection control rounds or audits should be conducted annually in all clinical areas that reprocess critical and semicritical devices to ensure adherence to the reprocessing standards and policies. Results of infection control rounds should be provided to the unit managers, and deficiencies in reprocessing should be corrected and the corrective measures documented to infection control within 2 weeks (immediately correct patient safety issues, such as exposure time to high-level disinfectant).",

There is virtually no documented risk of transmitting infectious agents to patients via noncritical items31 when they are used as noncritical items and do not contact nonintact skin and/or mucous membranes. However, these items (eg, bedside tables, bed rails) could potentially contribute to secondary transmission by contaminating hands of healthcare personnel or by contact with medical equipment that will subsequently come in contact with patients.32\nTable 1 and Table 4\nlist several low-level disinfectants that may be used for noncritical items. Table 4 lists the advantages and disadvantages of the low-level disinfectants that are used on noncritical patient care items (eg, blood pressure cuffs) and noncritical environmental surfaces. The exposure time for low-level disinfection of noncritical items is at least 1 minute.",

There are at least 2 (and maybe 3) reasons for this reprocessing failure and why outbreaks continue to occur. First, studies have shown that the internal channel of GI endoscopes, including duodenoscopes, may contain 107\u221210 (7\u201310-log10) enteric microorganisms.40, 41 Investigations have demonstrated that the cleaning step in endoscope reprocessing results in a 2- to 6-log10 reduction of microbes and the HLD step results in another 4- to 6-log10 reduction of mycobacteria for a total 6- to 12-log10 reduction of microbes.40, 41, 42 Thus, the margin of safety associated with cleaning and HLD of GI endoscopes is minimal or nonexistent (level of contamination: 4-log10 [maximum contamination, minimal cleaning/HLD] to \u22125-log10 [minimum contamination, maximum cleaning/HLD]). Therefore, any deviation from proper reprocessing (such as crevices associated with the elevator channel) could lead to failure to eliminate contamination with a possibility of subsequent patient-to-patient transmission. This low (or nonexistent) margin of safety associated with endoscope reprocessing compares with the 17-log10 margin of safety associated with cleaning and sterilization of surgical instruments.23\n",

It has a separate channel and provides orientation of catheters, guidewires, and accessories into the endoscopic visual field.25 This channel is complex in design and has crevices that are difficult to access with a cleaning brush and may impede effective reprocessing.43 Based on this and other recent studies, it is likely that MDR pathogens are acting as marker or indicator organisms for ineffective reprocessing of the complex design of duodenoscopes, which is an infectious risk to patients.",

Of course, we must continue to emphasize the enforcement of evidenced-based practices, including equipment maintenance, and routine audits with at least yearly competency testing of reprocessing staff.13, 35, 36 All reprocessing personnel must be knowledgeable and thoroughly trained on the reprocessing instructions for duodenoscopes. This training includes the new recommendations to use a small bristle cleaning brush and for additional flushing and cleaning steps of the duodenoscope elevator channel (http://medical.olympusamerica.com/sites/default/files/pdf/150326_TJF-Q180V_Customer_letter.pdf). Although these steps were described as validated, no public data are available on the ability of these new cleaning recommendations to yield an ERCP scope devoid of bacteria. But we must do more or additional outbreaks will likely continue. For example, all hospitals that reprocess duodenoscopes should select one of the enhanced methods for reprocessing duodenoscopes. These enhanced methods have been priority ranked with the first providing the greatest margin of safety.25 They include (1) ETO sterilization after HLD with periodic microbiologic surveillance; (2) double HLD with periodic microbiologic surveillance; (3) HLD with scope quarantine until negative culture results are returned; (4) liquid chemical sterilant processing system using peracetic acid (rinsed with extensively treated potable water) with periodic microbiologic surveillance; (5) other FDA-cleared low-temperature sterilization technology (provided material compatibility and sterilization validation testing performed using the sterilizer and endoscope) after HLD, with periodic microbiologic surveillance; and (6) HLD with periodic microbiologic surveillance. These supplemental measures to enhance duodenoscope reprocessing made in May-June 201525 were reinforced by the FDA in August 2015.43 UNC Hospitals has chosen ETO sterilization after HLD with periodic microbiologic surveillance as its primary reprocessing method for duodenoscopes and if the ETO sterilizer is not available, then double HLD with periodic microbiologic surveillance.49\n",

The authors have found that collaboration between infection prevention and environmental services staff, nursing, and management is critical to an effective environmental cleaning program. This collaboration includes ensuring that environmental services staff recognize the significance and relationship of adhering to proper work procedures to reduction of microbial contamination. The assignment of cleaning responsibility (eg, medical equipment to be cleaned by nursing; environmental surfaces to be cleaned by environmental service) is also important to ensure all objects and surfaces in a patient room are decontaminated, especially the surfaces of medical equipment (eg, cardiac monitors). Improved environmental cleaning has been demonstrated to reduce the environmental contamination with VRE,61 MRSA,62 and C difficile.63 Further, all studies have only focused improvement on a limited number of high-risk objects. Thus, a concern of published studies is that they have only demonstrated improved cleaning of a limited number of high-risk objects (or targeted objects) not an improvement in the overall thoroughness of room decontamination, which is the objective.",

UV radiation has peak germicidal effectiveness in the wavelength range of 240 to 280 nm. Mercury gas bulbs emit UV-C at 254 nm, whereas xenon gas bulbs produce a broad spectrum of radiation that encompasses the UV (100\u2013280 nm) and the visible (380\u2013700 nm) electromagnetic spectra.68 The efficacy of UV radiation is a function of many different parameters such as dose, distance, direct or shaded exposure, exposure time, lamp placement, pathogen, carrier or surface tested, inoculum method, organic load and orientation of carriers (eg, parallel vs perpendicular). Data demonstrate that several UV systems have effectiveness (eg, eliminate >3-log10 vegetative bacteria [MRSA, VRE, Acinetobacter baumannii] and >2.4-log10 C difficile) at relatively short exposure times (eg, 5\u201325 minutes for bacteria, 10\u201360 minutes for C difficile spores).68, 69, 70 The studies also demonstrated reduced effectiveness when surfaces were not in direct line-of-sight.68, 69, 70, 71, 72\n",

Because the high-level disinfectants are commonly used to disinfect endocavitary probes (eg, vaginal probes, rectal probes), there is an urgency to corroborating these data. In a conversation with CDC staff regarding this issue, it was determined hospitals should continue to use the FDA-cleared high-level disinfectants consistent with the manufacturers\u2019 instructions until the data can be corroborated.

In one study, the results demonstrated complete inactivation (>6-log10 reduction) of VRE and a CRE-Klebsiella pneumoniae strain both in the presence and absence of 5% fetal calf serum (FCS). The Trophon EPR system showed good, but not complete, inactivation of Mycobacterium terrae (5.2-log10 reduction for M terrae with FCS, a 4.6-log10 reduction for M terrae without FCS) and C difficile spores (5.1-log10 reduction for C difficile spores with FCS, 6.2-log10 reduction for C difficile spores without FCS).89 To simulate a worse-case condition, cleaning was not done before disinfection in these experiments; but proper cleaning of probes is necessary to ensure the success of high-level disinfection. Other data have demonstrated the activity of Trophon to inactivate human papilloma virus88 and other pathogens (eg, bacteria, mycobacteria, viruses) including a greater than 6-log10 reduction of M terrae and C difficile spores in carrier tests and a greater than 6-log10 reduction in M terrae on inoculated ultrasound probes.90 These results differ slightly from those presented earlier, presumably because of the differences in testing methodology. In the authors\u2019 study only the probe devices were inoculated (carriers of different materials were not tested); for recovery of bacteria on the probe, the probes were immersed in media (not swabbed, which would likely result in lower recovery).89 The Trophon system processes the portion of the probe that has mucous membrane contact but also the handle of endocavitary probes, which may be contaminated; it is an alternative to high-level chemical disinfection for ultrasound probes.",

The use of a tagging system, in both inpatient and outpatient facilities,91 that separates processed from nonprocessed items minimizes the risk that a nondisinfected, semicritical device would be used and potentially lead to cross-transmission of a pathogen.7 This tagging system could involve a tag (eg, green tag, patient ready; red tag, requires reprocessing) for GI endoscopes or a plastic sheath or plastic-paper peel pouch (eg, endocavitary probes).

In fact, failure to perfuse the channel led to only minimal, if any, reduction in bacterial contamination. However, complete inactivation of 108 CFU of both VRE and CRE was achieved when the channel was actively perfused. It seems that no high-level disinfectant entered the channel unless it was actively perfused, as the level of microbial contamination was not reduced by immersion.29 This failure to perfuse the channel occurs because the air pressure in the channel is stronger than the fluid pressure at the fluid-air interface. Recommendations are provided for cystoscope HLD and include actively perfusing the device while immersed in the high-level disinfectant.93 Unfortunately, some cystoscope reprocessing recommendations published in the literature are incorrect. For example, investigators have recommended complete immersion of the cystoscope into the high-level disinfectant but did not mention perfusion of the high-level disinfectant into the channel.94\n",

It typically consists of a blade that connects to a handle, which usually contains 2 batteries that power the light source. Limited guidelines are available for reprocessing laryngoscope blades and handles, and hospital practices vary.95, 96, 97 For example, some guidelines recommend and hospitals use low-level disinfection of the handle as it does not have direct contact with a mucous membrane, whereas others recommend the handle be high-level disinfected to prevent disease transmission. Although blades have been linked to HAIs, handles have not been directly linked to HAIs. However, reports of contamination with blood (40% of the handles positive for occult blood) and potentially pathogenic microorganisms (86% of the handles deemed ready for patient use were contaminated with pathogens, such as S aureus, Acinetobacter) suggest its potential,97, 98, 99, 100 and the blade and handle function together. For this reason, it is ideal that the blades and handles be high-level disinfected or sterilized even if a protective barrier or sheath is used during the procedure. In 2007, the state of California required that both blades and handles be HLD or sterilized. UNC Hospitals is sterilizing the blades and handles (ie, blades via HP gas plasma, handle [without batteries] by steam). Other methods for HLD or sterilization are acceptable, but one must ensure the blade and handle are compatible with the HLD or sterilization process chosen. After sterilization the blades and handles are checked for function before packaging and then packaged in a Ziploc bag. Per TJC, the laryngoscope blade and handle must be packaged in a way that prevents recontamination after processing (Frequently Asked Questions, The Joint Commission, October 24, 2011). Examples of compliant storage include, but are not limited to, a peel pack after sterilization (long-term storage) or wrapping in a sterile towel (short-term storage).",

Relevant pathogens include Ebola,102 MDR organisms such as CRE, Enterovirus D68, MDR pathogens, Middle East respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus, MDR M tuberculosis, human papilloma virus, norovirus, and nontuberculous mycobacteria (eg, M chelonae). The susceptibility of each of these pathogens to chemical disinfectants/sterilants has been studied; all of these pathogens (or surrogate microbes such as feline-calicivirus for Norwalk virus, vaccinia for variola,103 and Bacillus atrophaeus [formerly B subtilis] for B anthracis) are susceptible to currently available chemical disinfectants/sterilants.19, 104 Standard sterilization and disinfection procedures for patient-care equipment (as recommended in this article) are adequate to sterilize or disinfect instruments or devices contaminated with blood or other body fluids from persons infected with blood-borne pathogens, emerging pathogens, and bioterrorism agents, with the exception of prions, HPV, and C difficile spores (see earlier discussion). No changes in current procedures for cleaning, disinfecting, or sterilizing need to be made.13\n",
