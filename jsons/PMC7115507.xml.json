The Baltimore classification distinguishes three groups of RNA viruses based on the nature of their genome and mode of replication: double-stranded RNA viruses, negative-sense ssRNA viruses, and positive-sense ssRNA (+RNA) viruses [1,2]. The +RNA viruses form the largest group and contain many important human pathogens, such as dengue virus, hepatitis C virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [3], middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus [4], Zika virus (ZIKV) [[5], (a), (b)], and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) [6]. Antiviral therapy is still lacking for most of these viruses that have a serious impact on human health. Thus, it is desirable to develop new antiviral agents for the treatment of viral diseases caused by RNA viruses.",

A close correlation has been detected between the antiviral effects of various carbocyclic and acyclic adenosine analogues and their inhibitory effects on SAH hydrolase in biochemical assays with purified protein [9]. These compounds were observed to be weak inhibitors of flavivirus replication in plaque reduction assays [[10], (b)], whereas they exhibited potent antiviral activity against the replication of ss(\u2212)RNA viruses such as Ebola [(b), [11], (a)]. Among these, aristeromycin (1) (Fig. 1\n) is the representative carbocyclic nucleoside, which was first synthesized in racemic form in 1966 and shortly thereafter, isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces citricolor [(e), (f), (g), (h), [12], (a), (b), (c), (d)]. It displays potent antiviral activity against several RNA viruses, that result from the inhibition of the SAH hydrolase [8]. Although it is a potent SAH hydrolase inhibitor, its therapeutic utility is limited, because of its significant toxicity [(b), [13], (a)]. This cytotoxicity may be caused by 5\u2032-phosphorylation of the compound and its inhibition of cellular RNA polymerases and/or incorporation into cellular RNA[(b), [13], (a)].",

Among these, 6,6\u2032-difluoro-aristeromycin 2 exhibits potent antiviral activities against MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, ZIKV, and CHIKV [14]. However, compound 2 still exhibited substantial cytotoxicity, although it was less cytotoxic than 1. This cytotoxicity may be attributed to 5\u2032-phosphorylation, similar to what is presumed for 1. Therefore, it is desirable to design aristeromycin analogues that retain their inhibitory activity towards SAH hydrolase without being 5\u2032-phosphorylated by cellular kinases. Therefore, our strategy was to design 5\u2032-homologated analogues that are expected to displace the phosphate-susceptible 5\u2032-hydroxyl from the phosphate-transfer zone in the kinases. The feasibility of this strategy is supported by the fact that (\u2212)-homoaristeromycin is inactive against HSV-1 and HSV-2, possibly, due to its failure to be phosphorylated [15]. Thus, we designed and synthesized 6\u2032-fluorinated-5\u2032-homoaristeromycin analogues 3a\u2013e, which combined the one-carbon homologation at the 5\u2032-position with the bioisosteric displacement of the hydrogen with the fluorine at the 6\u2032-position. It was expected that compounds 3a\u2013e would retain the inhibitory activity against SAH hydrolase, whereas the lack of 5\u2032-phosphorylation would lead to lower cytotoxicity.",

This antiviral activity did not merely seem to depend on the inhibition of SAH hydrolase, as 3a and 3b inhibited the enzyme with similar IC50 values (0.36 and 0.37 \u03bcM, respectively), although only 3a displayed anti-CHIKV activity. Regular 6\u2032-\u03b2-fluoro-aristeromycin 2a was inactive against CHIKV. In addition, although 6,6\u2032-difluoro-aristeromycin 2b displayed broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, CHIKV, and ZIKV, the corresponding homologated analogue 3d did not exhibit antiviral activity, despite its potent inhibitory activity towards SAH hydrolase. These results demonstrate that other factors besides the inhibitory activity towards SAH hydrolase may be involved in the antiviral activity of this series. More detailed studies on the antiviral activity of 3a and its mode of action will be published elsewhere (Kovacikova et al., submitted).",

These nucleosides were synthesized from D-ribose, using the Michael reaction, stereoselective electrophilic fluorination, and linear purine base build-up as key steps. Among the compounds tested, 6\u2032-\u03b2-fluoro-homoaristeromycin (3a) showed potent anti-CHIKV activity (EC50 = 0.12 \u03bcM) without noticeable cytotoxicity at concentrations up to 250 \u03bcM, which resulted in a high selectivity index (SI) of more than 2083. This indicates that one carbon homologation may prevent 5\u2032-phosphorylation, which results in low cytotoxicity. This homologation had no effect on the inhibitory activity towards SAH hydrolase, as compounds 3a and 2a inhibited this enzyme with similar IC50 values (0.36 and 0.37 \u03bcM). The antiviral activity of 3a was specific for CHIKV and to a lesser extent some other alphaviruses, whereas other viruses have been shown to be sensitive to the SAH hydrolase inhibitors 2a and 2b. This suggests that the potent anti-CHIKV activity of 3a is based on more than merely the inhibition of SAH hydrolase. This study shows that 6\u2032-\u03b2-fluoro-homoaristeromycin (3a) is a promising new template for the development of anti-CHIKV agents.",
