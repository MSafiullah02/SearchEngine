            "text": "Plant-made vaccines were popularized in the 1990s as an innovative source of \"edible vaccines.\" A number of edible crops such as potato, tomato, lettuce, bananas, corn, and rice were used to express antigens from various pathogens, including Vibrio Cholerae, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Norwalk virus, hepatitis B virus, and human and animal rotavirus, among others Arntzen 2000, 2003; Rybicki 2010) . However, although the initial prospect was highly attractive, subsequent research identified problems that would limit the advance in the use of plants as a robust platform for the production of convenient vaccines. Perhaps, the main modification on the focus was the obvious need for introducing some processing in the vaccine formulation to ensure plant biomass stability and proper dosage of the vaccine antigen. Among the technologies that have addressed the identified limitations are the use of bioreactors for biomass production, which allows full containment of the production process; freeze drying of partially purified material; the use of seeds as expression vehicles in order to yield an edible and stable biomass for dosage; and refining of expression systems for higher yields to allow for better purification and formulation of parenteral vaccines (Yusibov and Rabindran et al. 2008 ). These developments have resulted in sophisticated approaches that are currently making the adoption of plant-based vaccines by the pharma industry a lot more likely than in previous years (Table 13 .1). The following section presents some examples of plant-derived biopharmaceuticals adopted by the industry, which illustrate the positive impact of these advances in the adoption of the technology. (Landry et al. 2010; Penney et al. 2011) . This platform is proposed as an ideal approach for producing vaccines quickly, which is critical for new pandemic influenza strains and viruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It is estimated that plant-based vaccines produced in a transient expression system can be generated within 3 weeks from the release of sequence information.",

Previous studies reported that this antibody is capable of recognizing a cluster of high-mannose-type N-glycans on the HIV envelope protein gp120, leading to a high neutralizing activity both in vitro and in vivo, since it prevents transmission by both parenteral and mucosal routes (Mascola 2002; Veazey et al. 2003) . Tobacco plants ( N. tabacum) producing P2G12 were grown in adequate containment greenhouses at the Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology (IME) in Germany (Fraunhofer 2011) . At present, no results from the clinical trial are available, but investigators envisage that P2G12 may be used in combination with other plant-produced antibodies for the formulation of a broadly protective vaginal microbicide (Pharma-Planta 2011).",

Protalix Biotherapeutics (Carmel, Israel) established the production of a human recombinant glucocerebrosidase in suspension cultures of transgenic carrot cells ( Daucus carota L.). This is a therapeutic enzyme for Gaucher's disease, a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the human glucocerebrosidase gene. Unlike the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell-derived product, the carrot-derived enzyme has terminal mannose residues on its glycans, allowing for efficient uptake via macrophage mannose receptors. Phase III clinical trial was completed in 2009, and orphan drug designation has been granted from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The product is currently approved for human use by health agencies from a number of countries (Protalix 2011) .",

It is clear that production of biopharmaceuticals such as antibodies or enzymes are prone to less complex evaluations than the case of vaccines, where complex parameters such as achieving long-lasting immune responses capable of supporting immunoprotection should be addressed. Therefore, it is envisioned that vaccines, whose target antigens, immunogenic properties, and conventional large-scale production and production processes are well established, will be the first plant-based vaccines to be produced in transient systems, as this implies a standardized and approved path for the development of biosimilars. An influenza virus vaccine is the case that highlights this potential. However, the reluctance of Big Pharma to move from conventional production platforms to those of the new generation will still be a hurdle to overcome.",

Several factors may impact the immunogenicity of oral vaccines. Among these, formulation is a critical aspect (Gebril et al. 2012 ). In the case of plant-based vaccines, it is proposed that a protective effect is exerted by the plant cell wall, which is termed as a \"bioencapsulation\" effect. Interestingly, a number of studies have revealed higher immunogenicity when the antigen is administered in the form of a plant-derived preparation rather than as a purified soluble antigen (Rosales- Mendoza et al. 2011; Hayden et al. 2012; Pniewski et al. 2011) , suggesting a matrix effect that may be associated with (1) a delayed degradation rate or (2) the adjuvant effects exerted by plant compounds (Otsuki et al. 2010) .",

One of the few studies focused on this issue was published by Nojima et al. (2011) . They observed that humoral responses against rice proteins were elicited when rice expressing a chimeric protein comprising cholera toxin B (CTB) and an Alzheimer's disease-related antigen were orally administered to mice. However, the authors hypothesized that immunological tolerance against those non-target rice proteins could be induced by means of breast-feeding. Therefore, immunized mice were subsequently fed by lactating mothers who had consumed rice proteins. This led to a successful induction of tolerance, suggesting that the design of specific immunization schemes has a potential for modulating undesired immune responses. However, this field of investigation is still in its infancy, which highlights the need for expanding not only the evaluation target immune responses and challenge experiments in animal models but also addressing questions regarding safety in terms of the elicitation of responses against non-target proteins. Systematic research in this direction must be conducted to better understand how immune responses elicited by plant-based vaccines could be modulated in order to avoid undesired immune responses that may eventually mediate allergic events and other undesirable side effects.",

The induction of broader immune responses is a relevant goal, especially in the case of hypervariable pathogens (e.g., influenza or HIV viruses). One approach to address this is the simultaneous expression of several antigens from a single transformation or transient event. When a transplastomic technology is used, the use of polycistronic vectors can allow simultaneous expression of proteins (see Modalities for Expression of Antigens in Plants: Plastid-Based Expression Strategies). In addition, some virus-derived vectors may allow this in nuclear expression approaches. One such strategy involves the use of internal ribosome entry site sequences (IRES), which allow for the translation of several open reading frames (ORFs) via CAP-independent translation (Ha et al. 2010; Gouiaa et al. 2012) . Another alternative is the use of the picornaviral 2A endopeptidase sequence, which mediates a translational skip mechanism, allowing the production of different polypeptides from a single ORF where target antigens are linked by a 2A sequence (Halpin et al. 1999; Ha et al. 2010 ). These approaches remain essentially unexplored in the field and are considered to have great potential to aid in the improvement of plant-based vaccine production.",

In addition, some platforms implemented in the biopharmaceutical field remain to be explored for vaccine production. In particular, moss ( Physcomitrella patens) has been proposed by Rosales- as a robust platform for the production of recombinant vaccines. This non-vascular plant can be propagated in a filamentous development stage, named protonema, which can be grown in liquid media using bioreactors. This approach has several singular advantages, such as a low cost and well-established production system a platform for the production of plant-based vaccinesem, full containment of production, efficient secretion of the antigen to the media (facilitating purification), and the possibility of producing specific glycoforms by the use of strains genetically engineered for alternative glycosylation machinery. Exploring emerging plant production platforms may lead to innovative developments, for example, the production of immunogens with specific glycosylation patterns with improved immunogenic properties, and new processes performed under full containment.",

This represents a field of opportunity, as conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy lack specificity and show significant toxicity. Vaccines are proposed as complementary treatment. For example, the human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which is over-expressed by a large number of epithelial neoplasias, including colorectal carcinoma (CRC), gastric, pancreatic, breast, lung, and ovarian carcinomas (Hammarstrom 1999) , is considered a tumor-associated antigen that can be targeted in therapeutic cancer vaccines (Berinstein 2002) . This has been shown to be safe, and induction of antigen-specific immune responses has been achieved (Mosolits et al. 2005; Samanci et al. 1998) .

Of particular relevance are the objectives of this consortium that comprised (1) the development of robust risk-assessment practices for plant-made pharmaceuticals, based on health and environmental impact, collaborating with regulatory authorities within the EU and public groups to guarantee safety and acceptance of the production systems based on biosafety regulations and (2) design and implementation of a program intended for securing and managing intellectual property, and thus facilitation of the availability of high-priority plantderived recombinant pharmaceuticals to poor countries, while at the same time allowing the products to be developed commercially in Europe and North America.

Cancer. Interestingly, plants have served as a source of recombinant antibodies for use in the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Recombinant idiotype-specific personalized vaccines have been developed by the expression of tumor-derived single-chain Fv (scFv) antibodies in N. benthamiana plants by means of a TMVbased expression vector (McCormick et al. 1999). Autologous full-idiotype IgGbased vaccines have been produced by N. benthamiana plants using the transient TMV-based magnICON platform(Marillonnet et al. 2004). Mice subcutaneously immunized with this vaccine were protected against lethal tumor challenge. Patients with follicular lymphoma have been enrolled for a phase 1 clinical trial of the fullidiotype vaccine (sponsored by Bayer Innovation GmbH.http://www.clinicaltrials. gov; NCT01022255 ; NCT01022255).",
