            "text": "Assisted mechanical ventilation is commonly used for the treatment of critically ill patients, particularly when the acute phase is resolving and the patient needs to be weaned from the ventilator [1]. During assisted ventilation, patient\u2019s inspiratory activity is partly reduced by the pressure generated by the ventilator [2]. However, patient\u2019s inspiratory efforts occur and are difficult to control. They can lead to alveolar overdistension, reduction of airway pressure within the alveoli below the set peep level, and development of the pendelluft phenomenon [3, 4]. The esophageal balloon catheter is currently considered the gold standard to measure the pressure generated by the inspiratory muscles (Pmus), although other methods such as the analysis of the respiratory equation of motion are feasible [5, 6]. The measurement of the electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) is available at the bedside through a specifically designed nasogastric catheter, allowing the physician to continuously monitor the patient\u2019s main inspiratory muscle; however, no normal EAdi values are available due to the extreme variability among patients [7, 8].",

To measure PEI, a full inspiratory effort should occur during an end-expiratory occlusion maneuver lasting few seconds. In this condition, airway pressure deflections are due to Pmus and match esophageal pressure variations; therefore, the deflection measured on the airway pressure signal can be used to calculate PEI [10]. The PEI measured during occlusion is highly correlated with the PEI during assisted ventilation and could be used to convert the EAdi signal into a continuous Pmus signal [9]. We also showed that there is a high variability among patients, but in the same patient, the PEI is quite constant over intensive care unit stay [11].",

Airway pressure, flow, and EAdi, waveforms were recorded on a PC-based acquisition system by a dedicated software with an acquisition rate of 20 Hz (LabChart 7.0, ADInstruments, UK). The signals were directly imported from the ventilator; therefore, no additional synchronization was required after acquisition. Several end-expiratory occlusion maneuvers were performed during patients\u2019 inspiratory efforts as follows: during expiration, the \u201cexpiratory hold\u201d button was pressed and kept pressed until the patients completed an entire inspiratory effort, seen on the airway waveform as a negative deflection and a return towards the set peep value.",

More precisely, we identified the physiological variability of the Paw waveform during expiration in the 1-s period before the occlusion (e.g., 10.75\u201310.96 cmH2O, minimum value 10.75 cmH2O); the t0 marker was placed in proximity of the zero-flow point when the Paw waveform reached a value inferior of 0.1 cmH2O compared to the recorded minimum (e.g. t0 at 10.65 cmH2O). We then identified the t0.1 and t0.2 timepoints at 100 and 200 ms after t0 (Fig. 1). The last identified timepoint was at the maximum airway negative deflection during the end-expiratory airway occlusion maneuver and served for the calculation of the reference PEI (PEIoccl). On the same end-expiratory occlusion waveforms, PEI0.1 and PEI0.2 were calculated as the absolute value of the ratio between the deflection of the Paw (\u0394Paw) and the increase of EAdi (\u0394EAdi) waveforms at t0.1 and t0.2 as compared to t0.\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$PEI_{0.1} = \\left| {\\frac{{{\\text{Paw}}_{0.1} - {\\text{Paw}}_{0} }}{{{\\text{EAdi}}_{0.1} - {\\text{EAdi}}_{0} }}} \\right|\\;\\;\\;\\;PEI_{0.2} = \\left| {\\frac{{{\\text{Paw}}_{0.2} - {\\text{Paw}}_{0} }}{{{\\text{EAdi}}_{0.2} - {\\text{EAdi}}_{0} }}} \\right|$$\\end{document}PEI0.1=Paw0.1-Paw0EAdi0.1-EAdi0PEI0.2=Paw0.2-Paw0EAdi0.2-EAdi0",

We did not control for variations of the EAdi signal. Since the diaphragm is the major inspiratory muscle, during an airway occlusion \u0394Paw and \u0394EAdi usually occur simultaneously. However, in some cases such as the of activation of accessory inspiratory muscles or filtering of the electrocardiogram signal occurring during the first 100 or 200 ms, the increase of the EAdi signal might be delayed, resulting in abnormally high PEI values. Therefore, the definition of a \u0394EAdi minimum cutoff value was mandatory to properly calculate PEI. We analyzed the variance of PEI values of the entire study population obtained at 100 and 200 ms by 0.05-\u00b5V intervals of \u0394EAdi. Variance markedly increased for \u0394EAdi lower than 0.3 \u00b5V, suggesting that the very small denominator (\u0394EAdi) led to spurious increase of PEI (Figure S1, Electronic supplementary material 1). Thus, a minimum \u0394EAdi of 0.3 \u00b5V was required to include the end-expiratory occlusion data in the analysis.",

As expected by definition of the timepoints, a minimum \u0394Paw was always present, but the corresponding \u0394EAdi was not always relevant. The phenomenon of Paw deflection without relevant increase of EAdi might be due both to EAdi signal processing and physiological reasons. The EAdi signal is automatically processed for ECG artifacts elimination, which may lead to a brief flattening of the EAdi waveform possibly masking an increase of EAdi in the first milliseconds of inspiratory efforts. Furthermore, the EAdi signal records the activity of the diaphragm, which is not the only inspiratory muscle; in theory, if the patients would inspire using only the accessory muscles, the EAdi signal would be flat. Another physiological reason could be the recruitment of different muscle groups, as we noticed in the patient who showed an intense use of the abdominal expiratory muscles at the clinical examination, resulting in the passive inflation of the respiratory system during the initial phase of the inspiration. Thus, in that specific condition, \u0394Paw during the first 100\u2013200 ms depended on the relaxation of the expiratory muscles rather than the activation of the diaphragm, resulting in insufficient \u0394EAdi for adequate PEI calculation [15]. However, PEI measurement was accurate when \u0394EAdi was higher than the proposed cutoff.",

Thus, we focused on the median value, rather than the mean value, of the measurements collected in every patient to estimate the PEI during brief occlusions. Obtaining brief occlusions is feasible and safe for the patients: if the patient is ventilated with a pressure-based trigger, a brief occlusion with sufficient drop of the airway pressure is present at the beginning of every breath and is necessary to trigger the ventilator. Moreover, repeated brief occlusion is a widely used maneuver to measure P0.1, an index used for many years with no reports of any associated harms.",

PEI0.2 tended to overestimate PEIoccl, therefore we suggest to implement a correcting factor to improve agreement: since a 20% overestimation bias was present, we propose that PEI0.2 should be corrected for a fixed factor (PEIoccl \u2248 PEI0.2/1.2) for better PEIoccl estimation. Such correction led to a PEI0.2 percentage error lower than \u00b1 30% in all but one subject (range \u2212 39 to + 29%). The phenomenon of PEI overestimation for measurement performed early during an occlusion occurs also during non-occluded breathing, as previously described [9]. A PEIoccl estimation error of approximately 35% could be considered acceptable: translated into practice, the Pmus estimation error for a patient with PEI = 1 and EAdi peak = 5 \u00b5V would be lower than 2 cmH2O.",

Instead, PEI0.2 measurement could be embedded into the ventilator software, resulting in automated repeated measures providing a reliable value with no discomfort for the patient. For example, if the maneuver was automatically performed every two minutes, PEI could be robustly calculated over the last hour. Then, an estimation of the Pmus trace could be continuously displayed without the need of an esophageal balloon, possibly helping the clinician to modulate patient\u2019s effort, maintaining a low level of effort in the acute phase to prevent alveolar overdistension and a higher level during the weaning phase to prevent diaphragm atrophy. The measurement of PEI by an occlusion longer than 200 ms might increase the agreement with PEIoccl; however, the measurement might not be repeatable many times without causing patient\u2019s discomfort.",
