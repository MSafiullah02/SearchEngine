An outbreak of the epidemic in human society is closely related to the spatial scale and the interaction structure. G. Chowell et al. have investigated the growth patterns of the 2014 Ebola epidemic at different spatial scales  [1]. They have found that the global and the local growth rates exhibit different scaling laws. Depending upon the Cuban contact-tracing detection system, S. Clemencon et al. have studied the HIV/AIDS epidemics in Cuba  [2]. They have found that the contact network exhibits a pattern with high intra-connectivity and low inter-connectivity. Understanding the reaction\u2013diffusion processes in complex systems and finding an effective way to prevent and control the outbreak of infectious disease have become an urgent but difficult challenge  [3].",

In the SIS model, each individual is initially in one of the two states: S (susceptible) and I (infected). A susceptible individual may become infected as he encounters an infected individual, and an infected individual may become susceptible again after some time. In the SIR model, each individual is initially in one of the three states: S, I and R (recovered). The only difference between the SIS model and the SIR model is that, in the SIR model, an infected individual firstly becomes healthy (recovered), when he is immune to the disease. After some time, the recovered individual may become susceptible to the disease again.",

            "text": "The spread of infectious disease is closely related to mobility patterns and interaction patterns of the population  [7], [8], [9], [10]. An individual may move about aimlessly like a floating boat in the ocean or travel along a certain path like a move on the chessboard. Two individuals may interact with each other day after day because they are in the same firm or only have a chance encounter because neither of them likes establishing a fixed relationship with any other people. The mobility patterns and the interaction patterns have been extensively studied in the coevolutionary dynamics. M. Perc et al. have studied the coevolution of individual strategies and interaction structures, the coevolutionary rules are quite important in the occurrence of a variety of dynamical effects  [11]. A. Szolnoki et al. have studied the effects of mobility patterns on the emergence of cyclic dominance, the mutual relations of pattern formation, the impact of mobility and the emergence of cyclic dominance are found  [12]. The original research related to the promising field can be found in Refs.  [13], [14], [15]. In order to understand the role of underlying structure in the evolution of collective behaviors, different network models are usually borrowed to simulate the mobility patterns and the interaction patterns  [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. The existing network models can be classified into two families: the network with a single layer, including regular network, random network and scale-free network  [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], and the network with multiple-layers  [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], which consists of two or more sub-networks. S.V. Buldyrev et al. have studied the properties of two interdependent networks  [33], a broader degree distribution is found to increase the vulnerability of the interdependent networks. J.X. Gao et al. have studied the percolation properties of interacting networks  [34], an analytical framework has been developed.",

They have found that the existence of community structure leads to a smaller threshold of epidemic outbreak. Z.M.

They have found that a heterogeneous network structure accelerates the spread of infectious disease  [38], [39], [40], [41]. K.P. Chan et al. have investigated the effect of aging and links removal on epidemic spread in scale-free networks. The local and global spreads are found to be related to the number of links removed  [42]. M. Dickison et al. have studied the epidemic spreading on interconnected networks. A global endemic state is found to be related to the strongly-coupled or weakly-coupled network systems  [43]. X.F. Fu et al. have studied the effect of mobility patterns on the outbreak of epidemic. They have found that the change of encounter probability, which may result from the change of population density or the change of moving probability, plays an important role in the change of infected individuals  [44], [45]. V. Colizza et al. have investigated the invasion dynamics in metapopulation systems. They have found that the heterogeneous connectivity and the mixed mobility pattern play an important role in the outbreak of epidemic  [46]. C. Granell et al. have studied the interrelation between the spread of an epidemic and the risk awareness  [47]. They have found that there exists a critical point for the onset of the epidemics. M. Boguna et al. have studied the conditions for the absence of an epidemic threshold in heterogeneous networks  [5]. A delicate balance between the number of nodes with a high degree and the topological distance is found to be quite important for the occurrence of the threshold.",

            "text": "Until today, in relation to the role of mobility patterns and connection patterns in the outbreak of epidemic, most of the studies consider the two factors respectively. However, in the real world, the evolutionary dynamics in reaction\u2013diffusion systems is usually determined by the coupling of mobility and connectivity, especially the group dynamics in social and economic systems  [48], [49], [50], [51], [52]. For example, a susceptible individual may be infected by an unknown individual in a random walk after dinner or be infected by a business partner. The coupled effects of random walk and pre-arranged interaction on contagion are short of in-depth study. In relation to the measures for disease control and prevention, the government usually takes isolation measures to prevent the epidemic. For example, during the outbreak of the 2014 Ebola epidemic, most countries tighten up on the rules for admitting people into the country. Alvarez Zuzek et al. have measured the effect of isolation in the multiple network  [53]. The epidemic threshold is found to increase with the rise of the isolation time. S. Bonaccorsi et al. have studied the epidemic on the networks that are partitioned into local communities  [54]. Their results indicate that knowing the spectral radius of the graph is quite important in judging whether an overall healthy state is stable or not. V.M. Kenkre et al. have studied the effect of confinement on the spread of epidemics in a system of random walkers who move in n dimensions  [55]. They have found that the spread of the epidemic has a non-monotonic dependence on the extent of the home range of the individuals. A. Apolloni et al. have studied the effect of population partitions, mixing patterns and mobility structures on the spread of the epidemic  [19]. Some efficient strategies controlling the pandemic potential have been found. The related work can also be found in Refs.  [56], [57], [58], [59], [60]. A.X. Cui et al. have studied the effects of strong ties on the spread of the epidemic  [61]. They have found that the epidemic prevalence is promoted by the strong ties. Although the mobility patterns and connection patterns have been considered as important factors for the spread of the epidemic, most of the studies focus on the effects of immunization and isolation, which especially rely on the knowledge of one\u2019s activity routine and one\u2019s friendship network. Generally speaking, compared with the route of random walk, a predefined interaction structure is much easier to be understood. In view of the coupling of random walk and predefined interaction structure, the effect of local activity restriction on global epidemic suppression and the role of the shortcuts existing between the individuals geographically far away are worth extra attention.",

[62], [63], [17], [23], [64], [65], [25], [6], in the present model, we incorporate a multi-layer network, which consists of a regular network with segregated spatial domains and a random network representing individual-based linkage, into the SIS model. The coupled dynamics of random walk and pre-arranged linkage is investigated. The role of narrowing segregated spatial domain and reducing mobility in epidemic control is checked. The motivation of the present work is to find out how the individual-based linkage between segregated spatial domains affects the outbreak of the epidemic globally, just as the role of the shortcuts in the outbreak of the epidemic on the small world network. The following are our main findings. (1)Activating the prearranged linkage between different spatial domains can prompt the outbreak of the epidemic globally. As the value of timescale \u03c4 ranges continuously from 0 to unity, three regions are observed. Within the region of 0<\u03c4<0.02, the epidemic is determined by local movement and is sensitive to the timescale \u03c4. Within the region of 0.02<\u03c4<0.5, the epidemic is insensitive to the timescale \u03c4. Within the region of 0.5<\u03c4<1, the outbreak of the epidemic is determined by the structure of the individual-based linkage. The role of activating the prearranged linkage in the present model is similar to the role of the shortcuts in the two-dimensional small world epidemic model. Only activating a small number of the prearranged linkage can effectively promote the global outbreak of the epidemic.(2)The size of the segregated spatial domain plays an important role in the outbreak of the epidemic. As both the overall spatial size and the population size are given, narrowing the segregated spatial domain not only slows down the spread of infectious disease but also leads to a decrease in the number of infected individuals in the final steady state.(3)Local mobility has a great impact on the global spread of infectious disease. On condition that there is little individual-based connection, reducing local mobility can effectively suppress the global spread of epidemic.(4)A heuristic analysis indicate that the change of the macroscopic characteristics of the propagation of the epidemic in the present model is closely related to the change of the scaling laws for the epidemic threshold and the mean first encounter time on a two-dimensional lattice with overlapping spatial domains.\n",
