            "text": "Several years ago, we postulated that the persistence of adenoviral DNA in lung tissue might contribute to the pathogenesis of COPD. We demonstrated that lung tissue from patients with COPD carries more group C adenoviral DNA, specifically its E1A gene, than that of nonobstructed control subjects who were matched for age, gender, and smoking history.10 Although this could have been explained by a greater susceptibility to infection by adenovirus in smokers or patients with respiratory disorders, it seemed unlikely for two reasons. First, a comparison of group C adenoviral E1A DNA in the lungs of patients with bronchiectasis33 and a variety of other chronic lung disorders34,\n35 showed that smokers with COPD carry the heaviest load of adenoviral E1A DNA. Second, in the acute exacerbations that characterize COPD, rhinovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and coronavirus were implicated in these acute respiratory illnesses, but not adenovirus.36 This strongly suggests that the presence of adenovirus in the lungs of COPD patients is not due to an increased susceptibility to these infections because of smoking or exacerbations.",

More recent studies have shown that levels of all inflammatory cell types found in the lung except B cells were increased in lungs of patients with severe emphysema and that this increased inflammation was associated with a fivefold increase in the number of alveolar epithelial cells expressing E1A protein.39 Furthermore, the E1A gene was found to be integrated at a specific site on chromosome 19 in the lung cells of patients with COPD.40\n",

After the initial acute infection, which resembles adenovirus infections in humans, had subsided and the replicating virus was no longer detected, adenovirus E1A DNA and protein continued to be found in a few alveolar and airways epithelial cells.41 Moreover, bronchiolitis persisted. In this model, latent adenovirus infection caused a lung inflammatory response to a single short-term exposure to cigarette smoke with a significant increase in the numbers of macrophages and CD4+ lymphocytes over the increase caused by cigarette smoke alone.42 More recently, studies on chronic cigarette smoke exposure in this model supported the role of adenovirus in enhancing lung inflammation due to cigarette smoke, because the combined effect of smoke exposure and latent adenovirus infection led to an increase in lung volume, airspace volume, and lung weight and to a decrease in the surface/volume ratio compared to smoking alone.43,\n44\n",

Northern blot analysis confirmed that this regulation of both ICAM-1 and IL-8 was primarily at the messenger RNA level. Other inflammatory mediators, such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, were not affected.46 Taken together, these results indicate that adenovirus E1A regulates specific inflammatory mediators in response to stimulation by LPS and suggest a common mechanism by which this regulation is achieved.",

One of these, NF-\u03baB, is usually found in the cytoplasm bound to the inhibitor of \u03baB (I\u03baB), which masks the nuclear localization signal of NF-\u03baB. On appropriate stimulation, signals transduced through the cell culminate in the phosphorylation of I\u03baB, which marks the degradation of this inhibitor.27 The released NF-\u03baB translocates to the nucleus where it binds to its recognition sequence in the promoters of genes activated by that stimulus. While LPS is a well-known stimulus of NF-\u03baB, CD14, its receptor, is not intrinsically connected to the transmembrane signal transduction apparatus. It has been shown that LPS also binds to the transmembrane toll-like receptors (TLR) that initiate signal cascades that are shared with the IL-1 receptor, resulting in the phosphorylation of I\u03baB.51 Of the nine TLR genes identified to date in mammals, controversy exists between TLR2 and TLR4 as specific receptors of bacterial endotoxins, although evidence favors the latter for endotoxins from Gram-negative bacteria51 such as the LPS used in our own experiments. In this regard, it is interesting to note that in cases of acute respiratory exacerbations, particularly in patients with severe COPD, Gram-negative bacteria have been isolated.52,\n53\n",

Because of their ease in culturing and their capacity to form stable E1A transfectants, we have gained valuable insight into the regulation of the expression of host cell inflammatory mediators by the adenoviral E1A. An acknowledged limitation of this model system is that these are mutated cancer cells and are most likely type II alveolar epithelial cells in origin.59 As such, they are more relevant to the pathogenesis of the emphysematous changes than to the airways obstruction component of COPD. Therefore, we developed primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells expressing E1A,60 which are more relevant to the pathogenesis of the airways disease.",

As with the A549 cells, these E1A-positive HBE cells responded to LPS stimulation with enhanced ICAM-1 and IL-8 messenger RNA expression, the activation of NF-\u03baB, and increased ICAM-1 promoter activity compared to the controls. While neither E1A-positive cells nor control HBE cells expressed the CD14 LPS receptor, both expressed low levels of TLR2 messenger RNA (Fig 2\n) with no change after LPS stimulation. These results demonstrate that adenovirus E1A enhances the expression of specific inflammatory mediators in both A549 and HBE cells and does so, most likely, through the transcription factor NF-\u03baB.",

E1A induces TLR2 messenger RNA expression in A549 cells, and this expression is not affected by LPS stimulation. On the other hand, as described above, no difference in TLR2 messenger RNA expression was observed between E1A-positive HBE cells and control cells, and, again, LPS did not affect the expression. More recently, TLR4 messenger RNA expression, while present at low levels in control HBE cells, was found to be significantly increased in the E1A-positive counterparts, and LPS stimulation did not alter this expression (Fig 2). Whether these differences in TLR2 or TLR4 expression caused by E1A in A549 and HBE cells, respectively, relate to the enhanced expression of IL-8 and ICAM-1 in response to LPS in these cells requires further investigation.",
