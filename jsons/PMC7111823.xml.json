However, with the recognition that the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was caused by a coronavirus, it became apparent that coronaviruses could also cause more significant disease in the human population (Drosten et al., 2003, Fouchier et al., 2003). Since then, two additional coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, have been identified; these agents cause upper and lower respiratory tract diseases that are much less severe than SARS (van der Hoek et al., 2004, Woo et al., 2005).",

For example, Talbot and co-workers showed, using the mouse-adapted virus after passage in tissue culture cells (termed HCoV-OC43QUE herein;) that mice infected intranasally with 104\u2013105 TCID50 developed encephalitis if inoculated 8 days but not 21 days postnatally (Jacomy and Talbot, 2003). HCoV-OC43QUE was passaged 5\u20136 times in tissue culture prior to use in mice (personal communication, Dr. Pierre Talbot, INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier, Laval, Quebec) and consequently may be less virulent than virus isolated directly from infected suckling mouse brains. Consistent with this possibility, we observed, in preliminary experiments, that virus directly harvested from suckling mouse brains caused a lethal infection after intranasal inoculation of 5- to 8-week-old mice. Mice died 9\u201311 days after inoculation, a time when the adaptive immune response to another coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), is maximal (Bergmann et al., 1999). To begin to understand these differences in virulence, we initiated a more complete study of the disease caused by the neurovirulent strain of HCoV-OC43.",

            "text": "This ability of HCoV-OC43 to cross species barriers to infect mice and to gain virulence in the new host contrasts with the strict species specificity exhibited by most coronaviruses. For example, the group I coronavirus HCoV-229E does not readily infect mice, even transgenic mice expressing human aminopeptidase N, the virus receptor for HCoV-229E (Wentworth et al., 2005). However, the ability of the group II coronavirus HCoV-OC43 to adapt easily to replication within the murine brain suggests that it may be more lax in its species specificity than other coronaviruses. In that sense, it resembles another group II coronavirus, SARS-CoV, which likely crossed the species barrier from animals such as palm civet cats to infect humans (Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004, Guan et al., 2003, Song et al., 2005). Unlike other coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and the closely related bovine coronavirus (BCoV) appear to bind to cells via N-acetyl-neuraminic acid (Schultze and Herrler, 1992, Vlasak et al., 1988), although there are data to suggest that HCoV-OC43 can also employ MHC class I antigen as a host cell receptor (Collins, 1993). This use of a sugar moiety for entry would also be consistent with the ability to infect a broader range of species than most coronaviruses. This possibility was investigated by infecting tissue culture cells from several different animal species with HCoV-OC43, using both the mouse-adapted and the tissue culture-adapted strains.",

            "text": "The ability to rapidly gain virulence after passage in the murine brain is likely to occur via selection of mutations in the S protein that optimize binding and entry to target cells. Passage of neurovirulent variants of MHV, in tissue culture, selects for viruses that are attenuated in vivo but enhanced for replication in vitro. These changes map to the surface (S) glycoprotein (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001, Tsai et al., 2003). In addition, infection of rats with uncloned stocks of MHV resulted in the selection of virulent strains of virus; again, virulence correlated with changes in the S protein (Taguchi et al., 1985). Also, replacement of the S gene in the moderately virulent A59 strain of MHV with the gene encoding the S protein of the virulent JHM strain resulted in a gain in virulence in mice (Phillips et al., 1999). In other studies, several groups showed that the adaptation of the SARS-CoV to humans during the 2003 epidemic included several mutations in the S protein. These mutations were shown to enhance binding to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2), the host cell receptor for SARS-CoV (Kan et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005). Therefore, to investigate the role of the S protein in HCoV-OC43 pathogenesis, we sequenced the S genes of HCoV-OC43TC and HCoV-OC43NV and compared the results to published sequences of the S genes of several other HCoV-OC43 isolates.",

Mice developed signs of acute encephalitis, including hunched posture, lethargy and wasting by days 6\u20137. Mortality was associated with a 30\u201335% loss of body mass (Fig. 1B). Severe clinical encephalitis was associated with widespread mononuclear cell infiltration including perivascular cuffing and with loss of CNS architecture (data not shown). In contrast, intranasal inoculation of 5-week-old C57BL/6 mice with HCoV-OC43TC did not cause any clinical disease, including any weight loss (Fig. 1). Consistent with the uniformly lethal outcome observed in mice infected with HCoV-OC43NV, we detected high titers of virus in the CNS of infected mice. HCoV-OC43NV grew poorly in tissue culture cells and we could only reliably titer infectious virus using suckling mice, as described in Materials and methods. Virus titers increased from days 5 to 7 (Fig. 2\n). To confirm these results, we also measured viral loads using a real-time RT-PCR assay. As shown in Figs. 2A and B, there was a strong positive correlation between recovery of infectious virus and the detection of OC43 nucleocapsid RNA in the brains of mice. Also, and in agreement with the results of Jacomy et al. (Jacomy and Talbot, 2003), HCoV-OC43 infected other organs to a small extent, such as the lungs and intestines, when viral RNA was assayed by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 2C). Notably, the results also suggested that virus was in the process of clearance at the time of death since virus titers/RNA levels declined between days 7 and 9 p.i. (Fig. 2C).",

Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to track HCoV-OC43 RNA and antigen, respectively, we detected overlap between the pathways of entry and spread used by MHV and those used by HCoV-OC43 after intranasal inoculation. HCoV-OC43 was detected in the olfactory bulb and the olfactory nucleus at 3 days p.i. but was cleared from these structures by day 5 p.i. At later time points (days 7 and 9 p.i.), HCoV-OC43 RNA and antigen were detected primarily in the brainstem and the spinal cord (Fig. 3A, data not shown). Unlike MHV, which is known to infect oligodendrocytes and is present throughout the white matter in the infected CNS, HCoV-OC43 was not detected in the white matter at any time point examined (shown at day 9 p.i. in Figs. 3A, B).",

Jacomy et al. reported that HCoV-OC43QUE infection was primarily restricted to neurons in vivo (Jacomy and Talbot, 2003). Thus, one possible explanation for the enhanced neurovirulence of HCoV-OC43NV, relative to HCoV-OC43QUE, is an expanded cell tropism. To more directly assess this possibility, we used combined in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to identify cell types harboring viral RNA and antigen. We found that viral product was restricted to cells with morphologies consistent with neurons (Figs. 3C, D). Moreover, in some animals evaluated at late times postinfection (day 9), we could clearly identify Purkinje cells that harbored virus antigen (Fig. 3E). When we evaluated whether astrocytes were infected by HCoV-OC43NV in vivo, we found no evidence of colocalization of HCoV-OC43 RNA and the astrocyte-specific marker, GFAP antigen (Figs. 3F\u2013H). We also performed a series of colocalization experiments for viral RNA and F4/80, a macrophage/microglia-specific cell marker, but could not identify F4/80+ cells that were positive for viral product. To confirm these results, we sorted F4/80+CD45hi (macrophages) and F4/80+CD45int (microglia) cells from the CNS of infected mice at 7 days postinfection, collected them onto glass slides and stained them for virus antigen. Neither macrophages nor microglia stained positive for viral antigen, while infected tissue culture cells processed in parallel stained positively (data not shown). These data suggest that unlike MHV, HCoV-OC43 does not infect astrocytes or macrophages/microglia. Based on the morphology of the infected cells as well as the lack of virus staining in the white matter or in GFAP+ or F4/80+cells, we conclude that the predominant, if not sole, targets for HCoV-OC43NV are neurons.",

HCoV-OC43NV-infected RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice developed signs of encephalitis (lethargy, hunching and weight loss) similar to those observed in infected wild type mice, but with delayed kinetics (Fig. 4C, left panel). Infected RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice also survived longer than did their B6 counterparts (Fig. 4C, right panel). At the time of death, virus loads were 5\u20137-fold higher than detected in moribund B6 mice, when measured by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 4D, left panel) or infectious virus titers (Fig. 4D, right panel). At this time, viral antigen or RNA, detected by immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization, was detected primarily in the brainstem although more cells were infected than in B6 mice.

These differences in neurovirulence prompted us to determine the sequence of the S glycoproteins of HCoV-OC43NV and HCoV-OC43TC and compare them to the published HCoV-OC43QUE sequence, since the coronavirus S protein is often associated with virulence (Thorp and Gallagher, 2004). Included in this comparison are all available sequences submitted for a number of HCoV-OC43 isolates. These additional isolates represent strains that were reported as having been minimally or extensively passaged in tissue culture cells, as well as several primary clinical isolates that were never passaged in tissue culture cells (Supplementary Fig. 1). The sequence alignment revealed substantial divergence in the primary amino acid sequence of these HCoV-OC43 isolates. Of note, there were three amino acid substitutions wholly unique to HCoV-OC43NV (Table 1\n). Multiple other differences between the HCoV-OC43TC and HCoV-OC43QUE or HCoV-OC43NV strains are also present in both the S1 and S2 domains (Supplementary Fig. 1). The large number of differences will make it difficult to determine which substitutions are critical for tissue culture cell adaptation. Of note, sequencing of the 3\u2032 terminal end of HCoV-OC43NV, including genes encoding non-structural 12.9 kDa, the small envelope (E), the nucleocapsid (N) and the transmembrane (M) proteins and the 3\u2032 untranslated region, revealed no nucleotide differences between HCoV-OC43NV and HCoV-OC43QUE.",

This observation raised that possibility that HCoV-OC43, unlike most other coronaviruses, is able to infect a wide variety of species without substantial adaptation. To gain insight into this possibility, we infected a variety of tissue culture cells from a wide range of species (hamster, pig, human, mouse, rat, monkey and cat) with HCoV-OC43NV or HCoV-OC43TC. As shown in Fig. 5\n, immunocytochemical staining for viral antigen revealed that the tissue culture-adapted virus infected hamster, pig, human, mouse, monkey and cat cells, but not FRT rat epithelium cells. The neurovirulent strain also exhibited a wide host range specificity, infecting hamster, pig, human, monkey, cat and mouse cells. For some cells lines, such as murine 17CL-1, and human KB and HT1080 cells, we detected infection only by the tissue culture-adapted variant. Thus, both HCoV-OC43NV and HCoV-OC43TC showed broad species specificity, and not surprisingly, HCoV-OC43TC showed enhanced ability to infect all types of tissue culture cells. Whether animals from these various species are also infectable by HCoV-OC43 remains to be determined, although data suggesting a close relationship between HCoV-OC43 and BCoV (Vijgen et al., 2005b) make it likely that the virus would be able to infect other species after minimal adaptation.",

BCoV, which is closely related to HCoV-OC43, also infects mice (Akashi et al., 1981, Barthold et al., 1990); phylogenetic analyses suggest that the two viruses diverged as recently as 1891 (Vijgen et al., 2005b). These results suggest that HCoV-OC43 or BCoV crossed species from either humans or bovine to infect the other species, although the direction of spread is not known. This ability to cross species is also shared by SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV spread from exotic animals, most likely palm civet cats, to humans during contacts in \u201cwet markets\u201d in China (Peiris et al., 2004). Also, as part of efforts to study the pathogenesis of this virus and to develop vaccines, several animal species, including mice, cats, ferrets and monkeys were shown to be susceptible to infection with the virus (Peiris et al., 2004). SARS-CoV did not cause reproducible disease in any of these species, suggesting that further adaptation was required for optimal virus replication in these heterologous species. HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV differ from many coronaviruses, exemplified by HCoV-229E, in their ability to cross species. HCoV-229E, a human respiratory virus, does not infect mice or even mice transgenic for human aminopeptidase N (hAPN), the HCoV-229E host cell receptor (Wentworth et al., 2005). However, infection occurs, albeit with mild clinical disease if virus is adapted for growth in murine cells expressing hAPN and if mice are deficient in type I interferon responses (Lassnig et al., 2005).",

            "text": "SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43, while both able to cross species, differ in regard to host cell receptor usage. The primary receptor for SARS-CoV is angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and other molecules such as DC-SIGN serve to enhance binding to target cells (Jeffers et al., 2004, Li et al., 2003, Marzi et al., 2004). Adaptation to growth in foreign species involves mutations that enhance binding to heterologous ACE2 (Li et al., 2005). No proteinaceous receptor for HCoV-OC43 has been conclusively identified; rather, O-acetylated sialic acid or a closely related compound appears to serve as the host cell receptor (Schultze and Herrler, 1992, Vlasak et al., 1988). While little is known about the changes required for efficient replication of HCoV-OC43 in the murine CNS, it is likely that this process includes mutations that affect binding to host cell sugar moieties. Infection with the prototypic alphavirus, Sindbis virus (SINV), or with a picornavirus, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), is initiated by binding to a polyanionic polysaccharide, heparin sulfate (Byrnes and Griffin, 1998, Klimstra et al., 1998, Reddi and Lipton, 2002). SINV with enhanced binding to heparin sulfate is selected after passage in tissue culture cells. HCoV-OC43 may undergo a similar set of changes during the course of adaptation to growth in tissue culture cells. The S protein of HCoV-OC43TC differs from that of HCoV-OC43NV at 20 positions (Supplementary Fig. 1), making it difficult to determine which ones might contribute to enhanced ability to replicate in tissue culture cells.",

For example, disruption of the S1\u2013S2 cleavage site in MHV resulted in a viable virus that was attenuated for growth in tissue culture cells and mice (Stauber et al., 1993, Taguchi, 1993). On the other hand, studies in BCoV revealed no correlation between the presence of the furin cleavage motif and virulence (Zhang et al., 1991). Of the several laboratory isolates of HCoV-OC43 that have been sequenced, most contain the sequence RRSRG at the putative furin cleavage site. Kunkel and Herrler showed that S proteins containing this motif are not cleaved in infected cells, whereas two strains (designated OC43-CU and OC43-VA, Supplementary Fig. 1) in which the S gene encoded a prototypic cleavage site (RRSRR) were cleaved (Kunkel and Herrler, 1993a). The sequences of seven recently described primary clinical isolates also share the RRSRR motif (Supplemental Fig. 1) (Vijgen et al., 2005a). Whether or not these primary isolates are cleaved and whether this motif contributes to clinical disease in humans are not known. As reported herein, the S protein of HCoV-OC43NV contains the sequence RRSHG and presumably is not cleaved to a significant extent because it contains a glycine at position 5; it is even less likely that HCoV-OC43TC, in which the sequence at this site is IRSRG, is cleaved. Although the R759H substitution is unlikely to affect cleavability of HCoV-OC43NV S, as this is a conserved (charged-basic to charged-basic) change, it is formally possible that this unique substitution could alter cleavage and contribute to the enhanced virulence of HCoV-OC43NV.",

Of note, Jacomy et al. previously concluded that the adaptive immune response did not contribute to pathology associated with HCoV-OC43 infection, based on the observation that treatment of mice with cyclosporin (CsA) prior to infection resulted in more rapid onset of disease and an increase in the percentage of mice that succumbed to the virus (Jacomy and Talbot, 2003).

Of note, even damaged neurons have never been reported to express MHC class II antigen, making a direct effect of CD4 T cells on infected neurons unlikely. However, CD4 T cells are required for optimal function of CD8 T cells in the MHV-infected CNS (Stohlman et al., 1998). Sindbis virus (SINV), a prototypic alphavirus, also primarily affects neurons. While virus clearance is largely mediated by antiviral antibodies, T cells, by secreting IFN-\u03b3, are critical for clearance from spinal cord neurons (Binder and Griffin, 2001). Similar mechanisms may be involved in virus clearance from HCoV-OC43 neurons, with subsequent immunopathology. Future studies, directed at determining whether antiviral CD4 and CD8 T cell responses contribute to both virus clearance and to severe disease in HCoV-OC43-infected mice, may also be relevant to understanding disease outcome in patients with SARS, since neurons are infected in some patients (Gu et al., 2005).",
