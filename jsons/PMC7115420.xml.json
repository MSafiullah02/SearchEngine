            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus named as SARS CoV [1], [2], which infected 8096 people and killed 774 in 2003 [3]. SARS CoV consists of four major structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleacapsid (N). S protein is a large type I transmembrane glycoprotein responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion [4], [5]. The angiotension converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) on the susceptible cell surface is served as a receptor for SARS CoV. And a small 193 amino acid fragment on SARS CoV residue (S318\u2013510) was characterized as a minimal functional receptor-binding domain (RBD) [6], [7]. Moreover, CD209L (L-SIGN) is another receptor for SARS CoV [8]. It has been reported that SARS CoV infection induces both humoral and cellular immunity. Neutralizing antibodies specific for SARS CoV were detected on days 5\u201310 after the onset of syndrome in SARS patients. The levels of antibodies peaked on days 20\u201330 and sustained for more than 150 days [9]. Sera from convalescent SARS patients could be transferred to SARS patients for the treatment during the SARS outbreak [10]. At the early stage of SARS, although levels of serum cytokines including IL-2, IL-10 and IL-12 increased significantly, CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts in peripheral blood decreased compared to normal individuals [11]. In addition, SARS CoV associated memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells specific for SARS CoV S, N and E proteins were generated and sustained for more than 2 years [12], [13], [14].",

Several vaccines for SARS CoV have been developed and proved to be effective in animals [15]. Whole SARS CoV particles inactivated by formaldehyde, UV light or \u03b2-propiolactone could induce neutralizing antibodies in animals, and these vaccines were being tested in clinic trials in China [16]. Yang et al. reported that a candidate DNA vaccine encoding the full-length S protein induced neutralizing antibodies, which could protect mice from SARS CoV challenge [17]. After immunization with SARS CoV DNA vaccine, cellular immunity was induced by the evidence of high frequencies of IFN-\u03b3 producing effector/memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in mice [18]. Additionally, adenovirus, attenuated para-influenza virus and modified attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vaccines encoding SARS CoV S protein were used to immunize animals. Results indicated that these vaccines could elicit high titers of neutralizing antibodies [19], [20], [21].",

We found that the frequencies of IFN-\u03b3 producing cells elicited by the CD4+ T cell epitope N60 were similar to those induced by CD8+ T cell epitope N50. However, levels of IFN-\u03b3 induced by N60 in the supernatant of cultured cells were about 20\u201330 times higher than those induced by N50. The discrepancies of the results from ELISPOT and ELISA might be due to the production of many other cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-4 and IL-10 secretion by CD4+ T cells after stimulation with peptides. These cytokines could help expansion and survival of T cells in the course of culture [26].",

In addition, CD62L was regarded as a marker not only for na\u00efve T cells but also for central memory T cells, which could live longer but could not immediately exhibit an effective function compared to effector memory T cells [30]. Effector memory T cells predominantly persist in peripheral sites, which are key portals of entry for pathogens [31]. In this study, two dominant SARS CoV S peptides were used to stimulate lymphocytes from BALB/C mice after immunization. Results indicated that epitopes N50 and N60 could effectively induce the responses of memory CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, respectively. Additionally, most of the IFN-\u03b3 producing T cells expressed high levels of IL-7R\u03b1, but not CD62L. These data were consistent with our previous results when stimulation of T cells with a pool of SARS S peptides [18].",

Injection of animals with epitope vaccines could effectively elicit humoral and cellular immunity with less side effects [32]. It has been reported that vaccination with cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope could protect against human metapneumovirus infection in mouse study [33]. At present, prime-boost strategy has been shown to generate high levels of memory T cells in animal models. Several reports have highlighted the power of prime-boost strategies in eliciting protective cellular immunity against a variety of pathogens [34]. In SARS vaccine studies, different prime-boost immune strategies have been compared by use of several different SARS vaccine candidates, such as DNA vaccine, adenovirus vaccine, inactive virus vaccine and recombined S proteins [35], [36]. Generally, DNA vaccine appears to be more effective at priming than boosting immune responses. It is well known that SARS is a kind of pulmonary infection and lung is the portal of entry for SARS CoV infections. In the case of pulmonary infections, there is evidence that vaccines need to elicit mucosal immunity or effector memory T cell pools in the lung [37]. After priming with DNA vaccine, BALB/c mice were boosted with N50 and N60 plus CPG ODN, which dramatically increased the frequencies of antigen specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, especially in the lung. Therefore, DNA prime-peptide boost regimen could be an effective strategy in eliciting SARS specific immunity. Recently, it has been reported that injection of SARS CoV S protein into mice would result in an acute lung failure in vivo through the pathway of ACE-2 to which RBD served as the receptor [38]. These two dominant epitopes (N50 and N60) were just located in the region of RBD. Thus, inoculation of animals with these two epitopes based vaccine seemed to be more effective than SARS CoV S protein or RBD based vaccines.",
