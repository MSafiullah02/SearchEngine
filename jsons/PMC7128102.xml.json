Concentrations of viruses in effluent waters can be extremely high, sometimes reaching 1011\n viruses/mL (La Rosa et al., 2010). Several studies have reported higher symptom and disease rates among this group of workers (Khuder et al., 1998). They experience respiratory symptoms, fevers, gastrointestinal symptoms, and headaches more often than the non-exposed population (Khuder et al., 1998, Smit et al., 2005, Van Hooste et al., 2010). The term \u201csewage worker's syndrome\u201d was used for the first time in 1973 to describe the assemblage of these symptoms (Rylander et al., 1976).",

            "text": "Despite the fact that most WTC occupational symptoms can be associated with viral infections, only a few studies have investigated viruses as an occupational risk in these environments. Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of human pathogenic viruses in influent water, including noroviruses (Pouillot et al., 2015, Qiu et al., 2015) and rotaviruses (Baggi et al., 2001, Qiu et al., 2015) that cause gastroenteritis; adenoviruses (Osuolale and Okoh, 2015, Qiu et al., 2015), rhinoviruses and enteroviruses (Baggi et al., 2001, Qiu et al., 2015) that are responsible for the common cold, and even herpes simplex viruses, which can cause oral and genital sores and blisters (Bibby and Peccia, 2013). Among the viruses detected at WTCs, many of these pathogens are transmitted by aerosols (Tseng et al., 2010, Bonifait et al., 2015). Despite the importance of this route of transmission, surprisingly few studies have examined the potential exposure of WTC workers to pathogenic viruses through the air. Moreover, in these studies, only one or two viruses were analyzed (Romano et al., 1999, Uhrbrand et al., 2011, Masclaux et al., 2014). In Denmark WTCs, noroviruses (Noro) GI and GII were detected for the first time in air samples using personal samplers (Uhrbrand et al., 2011). Adenovirus (AdV), hepatitis E virus (HEV) and norovirus were also investigated in air samples from 31 Swiss WTCs. The researchers found AdV, noroviruses and HEV in 100%, 2% and 0%, respectively of the WTC aerosols tested (Masclaux et al., 2014). Enterovirus and reovirus were identified in 3.4% of the air samples from an aerosol study of WTCs in Italy (Romano et al., 1999).",

Rotavirus is a double-stranded RNA virus and as RNA is extremely fragile and rapidly degraded by RNases found ubiquitously in nature, there is a chance that samplers with a flow rate higher than 200 L/min tend to lead to the degradation of less robust RNA virus species during collection (Cao et al., 2011, Toulouse et al., 2014). The Marple and the Coriolis are based on two completely different capture mechanisms; filtration and liquid impaction. Both of these mechanisms may induce particle loss (bouncing and re-aerosolization). The different sizes and characteristics of the eleven selected viruses likely also plays a role in the capture efficiency of each sampler, as some enveloped or non-enveloped viruses are more or less resistant to desiccation caused by the sampling times and rates. Marple samples also suggest a wide range of particles sizes carrying viruses, suggesting lower and upper respiratory tract exposure. In both cases, viruses can either remain in the lungs or upper tract or be subsequently swallowed.",

The sites that showed the highest concentrations of rotaviruses were also the sights that had the highest concentration of total viruses (e.g., biofiltration sites of WTCs 1 and 2). Inhalation of pathogenic viruses causing respiratory infections has been studied over the years since it represents a preferential route of transmission for some viruses. Rotavirus is known to cause gastroenteritis. The infectious dose of this virus through the oral route is below 100 viral particles (Payne et al., 2011), which was 104 times less than the concentrations of genome copies detected by cubic meter in this study, although we did not test for viral infectivity. It is clear from our data that additional studies should be performed to determine the concentration of infectious viruses in WTC aerosols. The impact on human health of aerosol exposure to viruses such as HAV has not been documented, as they are not known to be transmitted through the airborne route. However, the possibility of these viruses infecting a host via the air pathway cannot be ruled out, and raises another avenue of future research. As mentioned before, WTC workers experience symptoms such as fever, nausea and vomiting that could be linked to infections by HAV. Like HAV, the possibility of rotavirus transmission via the air has not been examined to date, nevertheless, the fact that these viruses have been detected in air samples from a hospital (Dennehy et al., 1998) raises the likelihood of transmission via aerosol. In addition, a recent study performed by our team showed that norovirus, a virus responsible for gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide, can be present in the air (Bonifait et al., 2015), suggesting that perhaps other viruses that cause the same disease, like rotaviruses, could follow the same pattern. Establishing whether aerosol transmission of these viruses is a viable route is critical if we are to better understand the occupational risks of WTC workers.",

Although this study did not aim to document the surface contamination by viruses, workers can also be exposed to viral particles deposited on surfaces via aerosol deposition, i.e., the fomite transmission route. In this pathway, aerosolized viruses adsorb to charged fomites on a surface. The fomite with the pathogen can then come into contact with a worker, his or her hand for example. The worker is subsequently infected when he/she touches his/her mouth and/or eyes. Many viruses remain infectious for extended periods of time after deposition. For example, HAV and rotavirus remain infectious for more than two months on fomites (Boone and Gerba, 2007). This route of infection has been proven for many viral pathogens, including rotavirus (Butz et al., 1993, Hota, 2004), HAV (Sundkvist et al., 2000, Aitken and Jeffries, 2001), and AdV (Abad et al., 1994, Aitken and Jeffries, 2001, Hamada et al., 2008) among others, and yet remains an underestimated and understudied risk for workers.",

However, the fact that the majority of sequences that we were able to identify were not viral in origin was not surprising. While some viral metagenomic libraries are constructed with enriched or purified viral nucleic acids, in this study, we chose to sequence unpurified and unenriched samples directly in order to avoid removing viruses adsorbed to large agglomerates of particles in the air (data not shown). The most likely reason for the low number of RNA viral sequences detected in our study is that we did not achieve an adequate depth of sequencing to fully characterize this relatively minor component of the total sequences in our samples and why the viruses targeted by qPCR were not present in our metagenomic results.",

This suggests that low flowrate samplers may result in a better recovery of RNA viruses in these conditions. High flowrate samplers are preferable when sampling rare events as they can generate more concentrated samples than moderate to low flowrate devices. Nonetheless, the greater rate of airflow and the extended sampling period of these devices can damage the particles and organisms collected by the sampler (Toulouse et al., 2014). Some RNA viruses are particularly prone to degradation because of the fragility of their envelope and the instability of RNA due to the ubiquity of RNAses in the environment (Li, 2013).",

However, a particularity of these viruses is that they possess a proviral stage in their replication cycle where they insert their genetic material in the form of DNA into the chromosome of their host. Given the likely presence of contaminating DNA in our metagenomes, we do not know if the sequences identified in our samples are from the DNA provirus, retroviral messenger RNA or the encapsidated retrovirus RNA genome. Five contigs were homologous to Caulimoviridae, a family of single-stranded RNA viruses that infects plants and insects. This is a plausible result considering that the WTC inflow is a combination of domestic, industrial and agricultural surface runoff and storm water that includes many potential insect and plant viral hosts. We must also underline the fact that the classification of these data is based on the homology of our sequences to a database and thus the presence of a particular virus must be confirmed independently, something that was beyond the scope of this study.",

Interestingly, HSV1 was identified in our metagenomic data for site 4, and was not detected by qPCR. The presence of sequence homology to Variola virus, a pathogen responsible for smallpox, was unexpected, but is presumably due to the presence of the Vaccinia virus, the active agent in the smallpox vaccine that has a genome with high sequence similarity to the genome of Variola virus. The Vaccinia virus, the active agent in the smallpox vaccine, is in circulation in bovine populations. We must again state that the presence of these viruses must be identified independently (Assis et al., 2013).",
