            "text": "The year 1876 marks the birth of medical microbiology, for in that year, Robert Koch (1843\u20131910) described definitively the aetiology of anthrax (Koch, 1876) (Fig. 1\n). He performed this research in his early 30s as a complete unknown, having taken up a position as district medical officer in Wollstein (now Wolsztyn in Poland) in 1872. After each long working day, he devoted himself to his hobby \u2013 the microscopy of microbes \u2013 working at home in a small room adjoining his medical practice. Koch was neither the first to find rod-like microorganisms in the blood of animals that had died of anthrax, nor was he the first to transfer disease with fresh or dried blood containing these rod-like \u201ccorpuscles\u201d (Lord, 2001; Witkowski and Parish, 2002). Nevertheless, his elegant work was the first to demonstrate unequivocally that a rod-like microorganism was consistently present in blood and tissue of diseased animals; that spores developed under starvation conditions; that these spores could transform into the rod-like bacilli under nutrient-rich conditions; that the rod-like organisms could be cultured in pure form; and finally that the cultured material, either in the form of rod-like microorganisms or of spores, caused anthrax disease in experimentally infected animals. From this meticulous work, including in vitro culture, microscopy and animal experiments, Koch concluded that spores formed and survived for long periods of time even when the cadaver had been interred in the soil and that the spores could disseminate the disease long after an outbreak of anthrax. Koch's work established the strategy of the microbe hunters which led to the birth of medical microbiology in the late 19th century on the basis of what was later called the \u201cKoch Postulates\u201d:\u2022reproducible identification of the agent in diseased tissue;\u2022in vitro culture of the agent in pure form;\u2022transfer of pure culture material to elicit the disease in experimental animals.\n",

Pasteur provided conclusive evidence against the widely held theory of the spontaneous generation of life; specifically, he demonstrated that heated material remained sterile if access to the outside environment was prevented, but readily became vital if access was given to environmental microbes. Typical of Pasteur, he did not restrict himself to fundamental research, but instead saw his work in the context of application, for example in the context of fermentation of wine and beer. Fermentation is not that different from putrefaction and hence the link to infectious diseases soon became obvious. From 1877 on, Pasteur's interest increasingly focused on infectious diseases. By performing a series of experiments, he established unequivocally that the bacterium itself, and not some accompanying element, was the cause of the disease, thereby confirming Robert Koch's conclusions.",

At a farmyard in Pouilly-le-Fort (SE of Paris), 50 sheep were gathered, half of which were vaccinated with a culture of Pasteur's attenuated Bacillus anthracis whereas the other half remained unvaccinated. Four weeks later and in the presence of a large crowd of interested observers, all the sheep were inoculated with a culture of virulent anthrax bacilli. When Pasteur returned to the farmyard a few days later, he was applauded by the crowd of spectators; all of the vaccinated sheep were alive and only one of them, a ewe, looked unhealthy (and later succumbed to an unrelated disease). In contrast, most of the unvaccinated animals were already dead and the rest were to die shortly afterwards (Pasteur, 1881). Although the method used for the preparation of the attenuated culture and its safety later became a matter of controversy, this experiment was not only a scientific success and a landmark in controlled vaccine trials, but also exemplary in raising public awareness of the beneficial results of biomedical research. Pasteur's vaccine was very effective and its worldwide use was instrumental in reducing the burden of anthrax in livestock. Indeed, the Pasteur Institutes in France and across the world were largely founded and funded by the revenues generated from Pasteur's anthrax and other vaccines.",

            "text": "Both Koch and Pasteur would probably be greatly disheartened to discover how often the microbe B. anthracis, which helped to establish modern medical microbiology and vaccinology, has also been misused for unethical goals. For example, between 1932 and 1945 the Japanese Army's infamous Unit 731 (based in Manchuria) experimentally infected prisoners with B. anthracis, and in 1942 the British Army conducted anthrax bioweapons testing on Gruinard Island in Scotland and also prepared huge quantities of cattle cake contaminated with anthrax spores for dispersal by aircraft over German agricultural land; fortunately this latter weapon was never used. On April 2, 1979 in Sverdlovsk in the former Soviet Union (now Yekaterinburg, Russia) an anthrax outbreak was documented with at least 77 cases of human disease, 66 of whom died; this was the result of an accidental release of spores from a bioweapons research and production facility. Finally, in the aftermath of the terror attacks on the World Trade Center in New York of September 11, 2001, anthrax attacks were reported along the East Coast of the USA, distributed through at least five letters containing small quantities of very finely dispersed anthrax spores. These attacks resulted in 22 confirmed anthrax cases of which 11 were inhalational anthrax (5 of whom died), and 11 cases were cutaneous anthrax (Inglesby et al., 2002). Moreover, more than 30,000 individuals were treated prophylactically with antibiotics and numerous public buildings had to be decontaminated by laborious procedures. The perpetrators of this bioterrorist crime have not been caught despite massive investigations by the police and intelligence services.",

The concept and possible development of international \u201ccodes of conduct\u201d and other more binding biosecurity measures seem to be an inevitable result of the dual-use dilemma in working with anthrax and other high-risk pathogens. Scientists should not be slowed down or deflected from such issues and from research on high-risk agents; indeed they are a critical part of the dialogue and part of the solution.",

B. anthracis spores enter a host by cutaneous, gastro-intestinal or pulmonary routes \u2013 all of which can progress to fatal systemic anthrax. Whatever the route of infection, it is believed that B. anthracis spores are transported by macrophages from the original site of inoculation to draining lymph nodes. The spores germinate giving rise to the vegetative bacilli which produce the principal virulence factors: toxins and capsule. Then, the infection extends to successive nodes and the bacilli enter the blood stream where they continue to multiply rapidly, secrete toxins and reach remarkably high numbers before the host succumbs to a shock-like death. Bacilli shed by the dying or dead animal sporulate on contact with air and contaminate the locale, and a new cycle may begin. Anthrax is therefore an association of toxaemia and rapidly spreading infection evolving into septicaemia, and its control and prevention must take both aspects into account together with measures to deal with the very resilient spores.",

Where practicable, staff can be afforded additional protection by vaccination. Such measures also limit access to the agent by those with intent on criminal misuse, including bioterrorism.

Suitable animal models include A/J mice infected with toxinogenic, non-capsulated strains of B. anthracis, or outbred mice, guinea pigs or rabbits, infected with fully virulent strains of B. anthracis. To correlate protective efficacy in an animal model with the expected outcome in humans, rabbits currently appear to be the most suitable \u201csmall animal\u201d model. Rabbits are susceptible to infection by virulent strains of B. anthracis whilst they are relatively resistant to both the Sterne (pX01+/pX02\u2013) and the Carbosap (pX01+/pX02+) attenuated vaccine strains. In contrast, mice and guinea pigs are susceptible to the Carbosap vaccine strain and, depending on the mouse strain, to the Sterne vaccine strain, whilst guinea pigs are susceptible to the Carbosap vaccine strain (Fasanella et al., 2001). Thus, the pathway of anthrax pathogenesis in mice and guinea pigs differs from that in rabbits. Rabbits and non-human primates are considered more appropriate animals for the study of biomarkers and immune protection in humans (Phipps et al., 2004).",

Splenocytes recognise spores through a Myd88-dependent pathway, involving none of the known Toll-like receptor or NOD proteins. Upon interaction with spores, macrophages secrete IL-12 that stimulates natural killer cells to secrete IFN-\u03b3, and LT inhibits secretion of these cytokines (Glomski et al., 2007a).

Although functional impairment of antigen-presenting cells would appear to be sufficient to achieve this goal, this pathogen impairs all cellular components of the adaptive immune response. In addition, the anthrax toxins were found to inhibit the chemotaxis of immune cells, and this finding may be very relevant to explain the long time required to clear the infection site in skin anthrax (Rossi-Paccani et al., 2007). This activity is likely to have little or no role in the rapid pathogenesis of inhalational anthrax, whilst it is relevant to that of the much more common and slower developing cutaneous anthrax.",

It contains several proteins that are synthesised concomitantly with the cortex and the coat. One B. anthracis exosporium glycoprotein, BclA, which is the structural component of the hair-like filaments, has been identified (Sylvestre et al., 2002). BclA contains a central region with similarity to mammalian collagen proteins. This collagen region consists of GXX collagen-like triplets including a large proportion of GPT triplets. The number of GXX repeats varies considerably between strains, and this variation is responsible for the varying length of the filament nap covering the outer layer of the exosporium (Sylvestre et al., 2003).",

Involvement of specific spore antigens in protection, and mechanisms of the immune response to spores have been studied. BclA-deficient FIS have been shown to be as effective as the parental strain in inducing protection (Sylvestre et al., 2008). Spore antigens induce a strong immune response, both humoral and cellular. Spore-reactive CD4 T lymphocytes have been shown to be protective in the absence of toxaemia (Glomski et al., 2007a, Glomski et al., 2007b; see below).",

            "text": "Although anthrax is essentially under control in the industrialised world, it remains a serious zoonosis in the developing world and is enzootic in many natural parks. Historically, the disease has long been recognised and some even speculate that anthrax was the plague described in the 5th and 6th Plagues of Egypt described in the Bible (Exodus 7\u201312). Anthrax has been one of the major causes of mortality in domestic livestock through recorded history. For example, Max Sterne, the father of the modern attenuated veterinary anthrax vaccine (see below), described major livestock mortality in South Africa during 1923 with an estimated 30,000\u201360,000 animals lost to anthrax (Sterne, 1967). The development of an improved vaccine by Sterne in the 1930s and improved regulation of the animal trade (including quarantine) led to a drastic decline in the incidence of anthrax in most countries. National control programmes work very well against the disease. Indeed anthrax is today considered an uncommon disease in Western Europe, Northern America and Australia, with exceptions in endemic foci in wild fauna in the national parks (Hugh-Jones, 1999). For example, in Canada, the situation is under control with the exception of a few epidemics in the bison population of the MacKenzie Bison Sanctuary and Wood Bison National Park (Nishi et al., 2002), whereas in the USA, the disease is sporadic in some areas and is hyperendemic in south-west Texas (Hugh-Jones, 1999). In Australia, anthrax is sporadic, although a sudden and severe epidemic occurred in Northern Victoria in 1997 (Turner et al., 1999). In Europe, the major endemic areas are Greece, Turkey, Albania and probably all of the Balkans (Hugh-Jones, 1999). France and Italy continue to record sporadic outbreaks (Fouet et al., 2002; Fasanella et al., 2005).",

In Russia and in countries of the former Soviet Union, lack of effective control programmes is evidenced by the high percentage of human cases, reflecting the inadequacies of both the public health system and veterinary service (Hugh-Jones, 1999).

In vitro experiments have suggested that B. anthracis can live and reproduce like a soil saprophyte in the rhizosphere of grass plants (Saile and Koehler, 2006); however, studies over the decades suggest that this is unlikely to be an important mode for spore amplification in natural soils. Vegetative cells of B. anthracis released in body fluids from infected and dead animals sporulate rapidly on contact with air and lead to widespread contamination of surrounding soil and pasture. The longevity of spores in contaminated soils is well documented and indeed, spores of B. anthracis were isolated from bones of animals that died over 200 years ago in the Kruger National Park (De Vos, 1998). Scavenger animals and blowflies can disseminate the spores over long distances in the environment and may infect further susceptible mammals. Outbreaks typically occur after a rainy season, causing soil disturbance, followed by a dry season. The topography of the land is important and downhill fields are potentially more dangerous than uphill fields due to runoff. Calcium-rich alkaline soils promote persistence of the spores in soils relative to humus-rich and acid soils.",

The 1997 and 2001 epidemics of anthrax in the Edwards Plateau in Texas involved domestic and wild species of animals, especially deer (Hugh-Jones and de Vos, 2002) and the characteristic spread of the disease suggested that insects (tabanids and other haematophagus insects) could have played an important role in the widespread transmission of the disease. A similar association was seen in a severe epidemic of anthrax in Victoria, Australia, during January to March 1997 (Turner et al., 1999). Analysis of these anthrax epidemics showed common risk factors, including previous history of epidemics in the areas and suspension of vaccination programmes giving rise to a high level of susceptibility.",

However, Bacillus strains associated with this outbreak were encapsulated toxigenic B. cereus and not typical B. anthracis. The finding that flies played an important role in the spread of anthrax in this outbreak was supported by the presence of profuse numbers of flies on the carcasses of affected chimpanzees and particularly on bodily parts with bloody effusions. Laboratory studies using mouse and guinea pig models have shown that Stomoxys calcitrans, Aedes aegypti and A. taeniorhynchus are all capable of transmitting anthrax. Although the transmission rate was relatively low (17% in flies and 12% in mosquitoes) it is suspected that the high population density of biting insects could be a most important vehicle in the spread of the disease (Turrel and Knudson, 1987).",

Although not specific for B. anthracis, typical colonies are often described as \u201ctacky\u201d with a highly viscous consistency, which is a consequence of the formation of long chains under these culture conditions and can be a useful preliminary criterion during diagnostic screening. Sometimes, there is a curly tailing at the edges of the colonies, the so-called medusa's head. This trait is also seen in B. cereus, B. thuringiensis and some strains of B. megaterium, and is therefore not a definitive criterion for differentiation. The latter species, however, elicits a strong haemolysis which distinguishes it from B. anthracis. Therefore blood-containing media are preferable in comparison to the often used PLET agar of Knisly, such as TSPB agar, which is made highly selective against Gram-negative bacteria by supplementation with trimethoprim (13.1 mg/l), sulfamethoxazole (20 mg/l) and polymyxin B (30,000 IU/l). However, it is important to note that colonies of B. anthracis growing within the lysis zones of haemolytic Bacillus spp. cannot be differentiated macroscopically, and this can lead to the false-negative assessment of environmental samples.",

Additionally, it has become necessary (i) for clarification of negative cultural results of the artificially contaminated control samples (spiked samples) or (ii) where spiked agar plates are uninterpretable due to overgrowth of B. anthracis by haemolysing Bacillus spp. For the confirmation of suspicious colonies, brief boiling (10 min) of resuspended colonies in buffer is sufficient to extract DNA compatible with the PCR. To prepare DNA from a non-selective enrichment culture, a DNA preparation kit generally gives a better result. DNA can be prepared directly from spores by simple heating or autoclaving if very high numbers of spores (>106) are present. However, if only low numbers of spores are present or expected, as in the case of nose swabs or in secondary contamination scenarios, DNA preparation should then be preceded by spore germination in culture. To identify virulent B. anthracis strains and for the differentiation of non-virulent strains, the presence of both of the virulence plasmids pX01 (toxins) and pX02 (capsule formation) must be evaluated. A negative PCR result can be diagnostic only if both the positive and negative control reactions are unambiguous. However, a positive PCR result should always be accompanied by the isolation of the bacterium causing the PCR signal, if necessary by aid of an animal experiment. The latter requirement is in response to PCR targets published so far for the detection of the plasmids of B. anthracis which may lead to the isolation of plasmid-carrying strains which do not belong to the group of B. anthracis sensu stricto (Okinaka et al., 2006). Nevertheless, such strains have been shown to be responsible, albeit rarely, for severe anthrax-like diseases (Hoffmaster et al., 2004; Klee et al., 2006). Because of the uncertainties connected with the presence of the virulence plasmids, a reliable chromosomal marker for B. anthracis is desirable. However, the published chromosomal targets of rpoB, S-layer protein genes and Ba813 very often lead to false-positive results from environmental samples (Papaparaskevas et al., 2004). An alternative chromosomal target of the sasP gene was described by Beyer et al. (2003).",

It consisted of an attenuated strain of B. anthracis that resulted from repeated culture for 8 days at elevated temperatures (42\u201343 \u00b0C). The culture used by Pasteur probably contained a mixture of bacilli with only the capsule-encoding plasmid pX02 and bacilli complete with both plasmids. Although the Pasteur vaccine strain showed reduced virulence compared to wild-type B. anthracis, variations in degree of protection and virulence between batches resulted with the occasional death of a vaccinated animal. The basis of the attenuation remained a mystery for about 100 years until Mikesell et al. (1983) showed that increasing the culture temperature to 42 \u00b0C results in the partial loss of the toxin-encoding plasmid pX01. Nowadays, live spores of the attenuated, non-encapsulated Sterne strain (34F2) are most commonly used to immunise animals. This strain, prepared by Max Sterne in South Africa in the late 1930s (Sterne, 1939), is a stable acapsulate mutant that produces all three toxin components of B. anthracis (PA, LF and EF), i.e. possesses the pX01 plasmid, but lacks the pX02 plasmid responsible for capsule formation. This live-spore vaccine has proved to be safe and very effective, inducing a profound antibody response against the PA of B. anthracis. A single dose provides immunity for only about 1 year, and repeated vaccinations are required for long-term protection. The Sterne vaccine is completely avirulent for most animal species, including humans, although residual virulence can be observed in goats and some laboratory animals. In addition to the Pasteur and Sterne vaccine strains, there are live-spore vaccines that carry both plasmids, yet are still attenuated, including the Italian Carbosap strain and the Argentinean A strain. The reason for their attenuation remains to be clarified.",

This work led to the development of two similar but distinct protein vaccines in the 1950s and 1960s, which are licensed and still used in the USA and in the UK. Both vaccines are produced from pX01+ pX02\u2013 seedstocks. The UK vaccine in use since 1963 is prepared from cultures of the Sterne strain 34F2. The supernatant of a static culture grown in a protein hydrolysate medium containing charcoal is precipitated with potassium aluminium sulphate (alum) and preserved with thiomersal. All three toxin components are present in the vaccine although PA is the predominant antigen, and the immune response is directed predominantly against PA and LF. In 1970, the US Food and Drug Administration licensed AVA (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed, known as BioThrax\u2122 since 2002), which consists of an aluminium hydroxide (Alhydrogel) adsorbed culture filtrate of the avirulent strain V770-NP1-R. The main antigen of the vaccine is PA. Formaldehyde is added as a stabiliser and benzethonium chloride as a preservative.

There is some observational data on the efficacy and duration of immunity in humans. One controlled epidemiological study was conducted between 1955 and 1958 in the USA (Brachman et al., 1962) and showed 93% protection in a group of vaccinated workers in a goat hair-spinning mill. In this group only 1 person fell ill with cutaneous anthrax whereas in the placebo control group 13 people developed cutaneous anthrax and 2 people developed inhalation anthrax; 3 additional cases of inhalation anthrax in the placebo group were discounted because these individuals withdrew from the trial. The protective properties of both BioThrax\u2122 and the British vaccine appear to be very similar. Unfortunately, immunity is thought to be quite short-lived and annual boosters are recommended for both vaccines. As might be expected for rather old-fashioned vaccines, these complex acellular protein vaccines have a number of inherent problems, namely unknown duration of protective immunity as well as a number of clinically relevant side effects, such as local pain and inflammation at the site of injection, and occasionally fever and general malaise.",

Alhydrogel is known to induce a strong Th2 cell response, which leads to high antibody titres, but elicits little or no T cell response. A strong cellular immune response against anthrax, however, would be beneficial for two reasons. First, it would induce a better immunological memory than the conventional vaccines. Secondly, it would address the problem of septicaemia during the development of anthrax, whereas an immune response based on antibodies alone is likely to protect principally through toxin neutralisation. Other approaches for developing a novel anthrax vaccine include the use of recombinant B. subtilis, salmonellae, viral vectors or plasmid DNA as vehicles for PA. The recombinant organisms, as well as the bacterial DNA used in these studies, serve as natural adjuvants, thus improving the immune response elicited. Different routes of administering an anthrax vaccine, which is currently injected subcutaneously, have also been investigated. Novel approaches focused mainly on oral, nasal and also intradermal application. The rationale behind this research is that these routes of delivery will elicit a strong mucosal immune response, which is thought to give better protection especially in the case of inhalational anthrax.",

Interestingly, capsule\u2013PA conjugate vaccines induce strong bactericidal and opsonic antibody responses (Schneerson et al., 2003; Rhie et al., 2003). Protection provided by spore immunisation relies on cell-mediated immunity involving CD4+ T-lymphocytes secreting IFN-\u03b3 as an absolute prerequisite for effective protection (Glomski et al., 2007a, Glomski et al., 2007b). Thus, the combination of a spore-reactive T cell immunity with a toxin-neutralising humoral immunity results in enhanced protection against B. anthracis infection. A combination of B. anthracis FIS and recombinant PA has proven to be particularly effective in protecting laboratory animals against anthrax (Brossier et al., 2002).",

Simple absorbance assays have been developed based on the use of chromogenic peptide substrates, designed on the basis of the recognition and cleavage consensus motifs (Vitale et al., 2000; Tonello et al., 2002). Alternatively LF can be determined using a modified ELISA in which the plate is coated with a synthetic peptide representing the 60 N-terminal residues of human MEK-1, or a recombinant MEK-1 fusion protein (Hallis and Hudson, unpublished). An assay based on electrochemiluminescence for LF has also been developed (Rivera et al., 2003), although it is rather laborious and expensive. Additionally, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay of LF requiring only low nanomolar levels of enzyme has been developed as a plate-based assay for the screening of potential toxin inhibitors (Cummings et al., 2002). All the methods for the detection of LF via its metalloprotease activity are biased by the possibility that protease contaminants present in the sample under examination will hydrolyse the substrate, leading to false positives.",

More recently, branched peptides have been found to inhibit both EF and LF binding to PA (Pini et al., 2006). An example of a powerful inhibitor of EF is adefovir dipivoxil (Shen et al., 2004). We have used EGCG and adefovir alone or in combination with antibiotics to assess the possible therapeutic role of these potent inhibitors of both anthrax toxins. However, they were found to be protective only if given at the very early phase of the infection (Fasanella et al., unpublished). This suggests that the role of toxins is critical for the initiation of pathology and that therapy with toxin inhibitors alone to clear infection is insufficient (Fasanella et al., unpublished) but rather should be combined with other procedures such as appropriate antibiotic treatment and post-exposure vaccination.",
