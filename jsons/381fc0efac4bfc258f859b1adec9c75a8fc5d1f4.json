While the true case fatality rate is likely lower, I must admit the cited 1-in-300 chance of dying if I become infected is not as reassuring as suggested in the paper. Also, additional risks of aerosolizing procedures such as CPR remain uncertain. These risks, known and unknown, carry greater weight when being experienced firsthand.",

If, in fact, \"it is\u2026 unethical for a dermatologist\u2026to refuse the management of a patient because of medical risk, real or imagined,\" this statement would be true even if the case fatality rate were, say, 99%. The paper concerning caring for a patient with Ebola brings up this same point, in fact, and notes that physicians need not be martyrs. 2 However, critical questions remain unanswered (difficult questions which I do not have answers for, either, and which warrant more extensive discussion) -what level of risk is acceptable, and who should determine that level? These are key concerns, especially in the setting of nationwide personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages and rationing. Hospitals may officially note that staff must not see patients without \"adequate\" PPE, but the definition of \"adequate\" varies from hospital to hospital (is it possible this definition varies based on the hospital's PPE inventory?).",
