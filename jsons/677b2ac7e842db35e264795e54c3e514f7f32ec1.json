Social relations provide an independent source of information about users and can be exploited for improving recommendation performance. Most of existing recommendation methods exploit social influence by refining social relations into a scalar indicator to either directly recommend friends' visited items to users or constrain that friends' embeddings are similar. However, a scalar indicator cannot express the multifaceted interest correlations between users, since each user's interest is distributed across multiple dimensions. To address this issue, we propose a new embedding-based framework, which exploits users' multifaceted interest correlation for social recommendation. We design a dimension-wise attention mechanism to learn a correlation vector to characterize the interest correlation between a pair of friends, capturing the high variation of users' interest correlation on multiple dimensions. Moreover, we use friends' embeddings to smooth a user's own embedding with the correlation vector as weights, building the elaborate unstructured social influence between users. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that modeling users' multifaceted interest correlations can significantly improve recommendation performance.",

            "text": "Many methods have been proposed for social recommendation in recent years, and these methods can be mainly grouped into two categories: (1) memory-based methods [1, 12, 14] use social relation as an indicator that filters relevant users and directly recommend friends' visited items to a user; (2) model-based methods [4, 5, 9, 10, 22, 27, 29, 31] integrate social relation into factorization methods to constrain that friends share similar interest embeddings. Moreover, feedbackbased similarities are utilized to weigh friends' interest relevance in memorybased methods [3] or embedding coherence in model-based methods [11, 17] . In sum, existing methods refine two users' social relation into a scalar indicator to build their interest correlation. However, each user's interest is differently distributed across multiple dimensions, and the consistency in one dimension does not mean consistency in other dimensions. As Fig. 1 shows, a user's interest similarities with his friends vary greatly in different categories of items. When the user needs suggestions on one category, he may refer to friends with strong correlations on that category, and suggestions of friends with strong correlations on other categories are not useful. Therefore, a global scalar indicator used in existing methods cannot express the multifaceted interest correlations between friends. Unfortunately, there exists no explicit evidence to refine social networks into the elaborate correlation, and simply distinguishing items' categories would make the problem of data sparsity even more serious, which is not conducive to the learning of model parameters.",

The correlation vector has the same dimension with user's embedding, thus can sufficiently capture the high variation in users' interest correlations on each fine-grained dimension. Moreover, we smooth a user's embedding by his friends' embeddings, with the correlation vector into consideration. The combination of the dimension-wise attention mechanism and the smoothing operation can impose strong and delicate unstructured correlations on users' embeddings while making interactions between users and items. Such an end-to-end framework allow the proposed method to learn the unstructured correlations in a fully data-driven manner.",

To accurately capture friends' influence on user's preference, one needs to model the multi-dimensional interest correlation between users. Fortunately, attention mechanism seems to provide a feasible solution, since it can automatically models and selects pertinent piece of information with the attentive weights from a set of inputs, where higher (lower) weights indicate the corresponding inputs more informative to generate the outputs. To accommodate our problem, we further design a dimension-wise attention mechanism and use it to learn a correlation vector for each pair of friends, building their multi-dimensional interest correlation for social recommendation. Figure 2 shows the architecture of DASR, which includes an attention layer, a smoothing layer and a recommendation layer. We learn a preference vector for each user and item, namely, t u and z i , and use DASR to infer a target user u's preference to a candidate item i with social influence of u's friends into consideration. Instead of directly performing inner product between t u and z i in the recommendation layer, we first use embeddings of user u's friends to smooth user u's own embedding in the smoothing layer, and the smoothing weights are the correlation vector learned in the attention layer. With these designs, we can learn strong and delicate unstructured correlations of users' embeddings in a fully data-driven manner and provide better item recommendation.",

            "text": "In the experiments, we add a L 2 regularization term to the users' and items' embeddings when performing optimization, and the regularization coefficient is set as 0.001. We set the negative slope \u03b2 of the LeakyReLU function as 0.2. For all latent vectors, we set their dimension as n = 128. We set the negative count c as 10. The learning rate decreases from an initial value of 1.0 with the increase of iterations, and the decay factor is set as 0.5. Fig. 4 present the precision@n and recall@n of all methods in comparison on the Gowalla dataset and the Epinions dataset respectively. It can be observed that the proposed DASR method achieves the best performance under different settings of n on both datasets and both metrics, which demonstrates the superiority of our method to these state-of-the-art methods. We take Fig. 3 as an example to make a detailed discussion. Specifically, among these methods, SoCF is the only memory-based method, which directly recommend friends' items to users. Performance of SoCF is worse than other model-based methods, which learn users' and items' embeddings. SoReg integrates social relations as regularization term in matrix factorization model with feedback-based similarities as regularization coefficients, leading to that friends share similar embeddings. It achieves a good result. Besides social relations as local context, LOCABAL exploits extra social influence, i.e., users with high reputation as global social context. This makes LOCABAL outperform SoReg. PTPMF splits social relations as strong ties and weak ties, and distinguish the different influence of the two types of social ties. We can observe that the differentiation in PTPMF model benefit the recommendation performance. Since ARMF's performance is better than ASMF, we present ARMF only for comparison. It is observed ARMF is the best baseline method. This may profit from that ARMF introduce friends' visited items as potential items and it optimizes users' preference to items in a ranking manner. The proposed method, i.e., DASR, learns rich correlation patterns between users' interest by a correlation vector and finally beats these baselines. Different from Fig. 3 , we can observe that LOCABAL is better than PTPMF on the Epinions dataset in Fig. 4 . This indicates that weak ties in Epinions dataset do not provide valuable suggestions for users.",
