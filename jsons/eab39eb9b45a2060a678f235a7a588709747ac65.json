This statement named the DNP as the most appropriate entry-to-practice degree for advanced-practice registered nurses (APRNs) in the United States (US) (AACN, 2004) . The AACN also set an ambitious goal for all programs preparing APRNs at the master's level to migrate to DNP preparation by 2015. Almost two decades later, and despite the AACN's vision statement, the Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) remains the predominant exit degree for APRNs. While DNP program growth has been dramatic in the last decade, with the number of US DNP programs increasing nearly four-fold, there has been only a modest reduction in MSN programs. Many schools continue to offer the MSN exclusively, and those that have developed a BSN-DNP typically retain the MSN option (Auerbach et al., 2015; Mundinger & Carter, 2019) .",

Written in the context of the Great Recession, during which severe economic challenges impacted all sectors, including higher education, Cronenwett et al. highlighted the simultaneous spike in APRN staffing needs due to rising chronic disease rates and the decline in resources, faculty, and clinical partnerships necessary for DNP preparation. The authors also discussed the potential impacts of increasing the length and costs of APRN preparation at a time when the national need for advanced practice providers was rapidly increasing. Did the factors described by Cronenwett et al. remain in play during times of more robust economic growth; and will they continue in the face of severe economic strains? Or have other factors delayed the transition from MSN to DNP education in recent years? The purpose of this paper is to describe the forces influencing nursing graduate education and to identify factors that have interfered with implementation of a universal practice doctorate.",

Next, we address the fact that credentialing and accreditation groups have not expressly endorsed a universal practice doctorate. We describe the extent to which healthcare industry stakeholders, such as practice partners and employers, remain key influencers on schools' implementation of the DNP and the importance of gaining buy-in from these constituents. Last, the ongoing debate over the need for DNP residency programs is reviewed, and financial challenges-arguably the greatest barrier to DNP acceptance-are discussed. Written in cooperation by nursing deans 1 across the US, this paper represents the type of open dialogue that we believe is essential for nationwide change in nursing doctoral education.",

This situation is similar to the decades-old challenge of stating that the BSN should be the practice-entry degree for nursing, while retaining one licensing exam for both associate-and BSN-prepared graduates.

Some leaders in midwifery have argued that a universal DNP requirement would make midwifery education less accessible, more cost prohibitive, and less diverse. This stance has been taken without substantive evidence that the MSN prepared workforce is more diverse than the DNP workforce. Thus far, no other APRN specialty accreditation body has advanced a position statement to transition MSN preparation to the DNP level.

Despite inconsistent messaging among healthcare leadership, the number of DNP programs and graduates grew steadily over the next decade (AACN, 2019). Specifically, the national DNP program count rose from 92 in 2008 to 354 in 2018 (according to unpublished 2019 data from the AACN)-but what was happening within schools of nursing tells a different story.",

Many nursing schools kept up robust MSN enrollment and only added the post-MSN DNP, which did not require extensive investment in clinical sites and could be delivered to large numbers of students online. This 'add-on' approach neglected the practice component of the DNP, sidestepping one of its central purposes as a practice doctorate. Many of the post-master's DNP programs were designed for working nurse executives and practicing APRNs; these programs often did not include clinical hours at all, but rather allocated hours to the capstone or final project. The 500 additional project hours were often used to develop leadership initiatives and were not primarily designed to increase APRN clinical proficiency. In fact, some post-master's DNP programs admitted students holding MSN degrees outside of advanced practice nursing altogether. Meanwhile, the number of APRN students opting for master's-level practice entry continued to rise from 10,737 in 2004 to 46,622 in 2018 (unpublished data, AACN, 2019). Figure 2 shows that only 152 master's programs closed between 2008 and 2018 (unpublished data, AACN, 2019). 7 That brings us to the present day-15 years after the AACN Position Statement on the Practice Doctorate-when the American Association of Nurse Practitioners reports 79.8% of APRNs hold a master's as their highest degree and just 14% hold a DNP (AANP, 2019).",

            "text": "Nursing Master's Program Closures, 2008 to 2018 DNP vs. Master's Graduates, 2004 to 2018 3The Evolution of DNP GraduatesSo, why did the growth of DNP programs across the US fail to significantly impact the educational level of clinical APRNs? The original intent for DNP curricula was to prepare a workforce of leaders in advanced clinical practice; however, the decade of fast growth in postmaster's DNP programs produced a majority of first-wave graduates opting for positions in administrative and educational settings instead(AACN, 2004;AACN, 2012;Grey, 2013). Out of the 7,039 DNP graduates in 2018, 4,232 (60%) entered full-time positions in schools of nursing, rather than bedside or clinical positions (AACN, 2019c). With almost five DNP graduates per year for every nursing PhD graduate, the DNP offered a quick way for schools to increase their proportion of doctorate-prepared faculty. While this wave of DNP graduates has helped to ease the perennial shortage of nursing faculty, to an extent, it has not counted toward the number of doctorateprepared APRNs needed to address the national primary care shortage.Yet, as a profession, it appears we have entered a conversion period. In recent years, the proportion of DNP students enrolling in post-master's DNP programs seems to be declining. In 2015, enrollments in post-BSN programs exceeded post-MSN enrollments for the first time, and data, AACN, 2019). If enrollment trends correspond to graduation trends, we can predict that the largest number of DNP graduates soon will come from post-BSN cohorts. This progress contrasts starkly with where we were a decade ago, when there were 30 post-MSN DNP graduates for every post-BSN DNP graduate. This trend suggests that the profession might finally be gaining the buy-in it needs-at least from students-to implement the DNP standard as it was intended. Nursing leaders should apply this momentum towards enacting long-awaited professional changes, such as updated accreditation and certification standards, while also accounting for the real-world challenges that accompany DNP implementation.One such challenge is the fact that faculty in DNP programs are grappling with how to concurrently educate experienced nurses holding master's degrees and post-baccalaureate students who may have little to no clinical background. The largest concentration of post-BSN-DNP students is found in nurse practitioner tracks (AACN, 2019a). However, the number of online postbaccalaureate DNP programs that focus on health system leadership and offer no advanced practice skills has risen, and post-MSN students are still opting for leadership tracks primarily. If one scans the types of nurses enrolling in DNP programs today, they represent a wide range of academic backgrounds and experience levels, including:\uf0b7 Nurses with years of experience as master's-prepared clinicians and/or administrators enrolling primarily in online post-MSN DNP programs to focus on executive leadership and/or education; \uf0b7 Nurses holding BSNs who have healthcare experience and are enrolling in DNP programs to become system leaders, many of which are online;\uf0b7 BSNs who have healthcare experience and are enrolling in DNP programs to become APRNs;",
