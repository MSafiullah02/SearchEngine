It looks as if we are all in this for the long haul, at least until there is a cure, treatment, or vaccine available for the COVID-19 (Synonym: SARS-CoV-2). No aspect of society is left unchanged. How is the pandemic impacting the world of intellectual property information, and IP management?",

The publication of information relating to COVID-19 continues to grow with the fast response from global health and medical researchers in patent filings (probably) and academic literature. Elsevier, World Patent Information's publisher, has launched a website for publication of corona virus related research [1] . Recognising the difficulties faced by authors and editors Elsevier have created a helpful portal [2] . It is likely that changes made to publishing may impact future information seekers of prior art and competitive intelligence, and authors.",

The Editorial concludes with an introduction to volume 61, and its first every virtual special issue on the topic 'AI for Analytics and IP management'. World Patent Information has previously published two 'Special Issues' (Volumes or Supplements devoted to a particular subject) in 2018. These were 'Best of Search Matters' [3], and 'Advanced Analytics of Intellectual Property Information for TechMining' [4].",

I have been busy making patent renewals and noted that some offices are allowing extensions for fee payments and other requirements. This is excellent news right now; but may bring future difficulties for those researching legal status, e.g. to check dead / alive status; and will bring new challenges for IP information providers. I decided to review the major IP Offices announcements to see what other allowances may have been made for IP Right holders during the pandemic.",

Time limits for payments of some fees due in March was extended for one month. The EPO has cancelled its (EQE 2020) examinations and other patent information events have been cancelled or postponed until 2021. WIPO has created a dashboard to make it easy to find out the status of each national and regional IP Offices providing a summary of operational status and time limit extensions and other measures which have been brought in to help users during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Decisions taken during opposition proceedings do not only matter to the two (or more) parties directly involved. Other third parties may also have deep interests in the outcome. It would be interesting to extend this study to other technical fields and over additional time. The authors also give a good explanation 'Blockchain patent landscaping: an expert based methodology and search query', by Nigel Clarke et al shows a method of collecting data for a patent landscape using Block Chain as an example. The paper will be of interest to those constructing patent landscapes as well as those working with blockchain technologies.",
