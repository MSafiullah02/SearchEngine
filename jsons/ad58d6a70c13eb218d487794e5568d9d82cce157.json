Instead of using a single virulence characteristic which is typical of most mathematical models for infectious diseases, our model uses a combination of two characteristics: lethality and transmissibility. This makes the model capable of reproducing the empirically observed fact that the increase in the host density can lead to the prevalence of the more virulent pathogen type. We provide some numerical illustrations and discuss the effects of the size of the enclosure containing the host population on the encounter rate in our model that plays the key role in determining what pathogen type will eventually prevail. We also present a multistage extension of the model to situations where there are several populations and parasites can be transmitted from one of them to another.",

            "text": "There is an extensive literature on mathematical modeling of infectious diseases. Both the rate of spread and the virulence of pathogens are important, and both the dynamics of disease spread and the evolution of virulence in parasite-host systems have attracted much attention. The first mathematical model of disease dynamics apparently goes back to the 1760 D. Bernoulli's paper [13] (see also pp. 2-6 in [16] ). A major step in further development of deterministic modelling was the \"threshold theorem\" [38] showing that the initial frequency of susceptibles must exceed a certain threshold value to give rise to an epidemic. The first stochastic epidemiological models appeared in the late 1920s [43] , applying the \"law of mass action\" suggested in [13] to probabilistic description of the epidemics. Stochastic models became much more popular after Bartlett [8] formulated a model for the general stochastic epidemic by analogy with the deterministic model from [38] . May and Anderson [47] introduced the first model of evolutionary change in pathogen virulence in 1983, which explained the decline in virulence of myxomatosis, introduced to control Australian rabbits, in terms of optimal transmission of the parasite between hosts. Subsequent work, notably [47, 19, 44, 40, 23] , has expanded on this classic paper, to cover the effects of a vector of the pathogen, vaccination of hosts, and various other issues. For more extensive surveys of the field and literature reviews, we refer the reader to the monographic literature [2, 3, 6, 10, 16, 49] and also to papers [4, 18, 34] .",

The models of virulence have made clear that this leads to selection for less virulent strains, such that infected hosts live longer, and thus tend to pass the pathogen to more susceptible new hosts, maintaining the epidemic. While hosts will have longer generation times than their pathogens, they too, will evolve to be more resistant, further reducing the virulence of the pathogen for these hosts. Thus one can expect pathogens to be highly virulent only when they have recently switched hosts, such as the SARS coronavirus that was probably transferred to humans from animals such as Himalayan civet cats [29] or when the plague bacterium, Yersina pestis, has been transferred to humans from rodents [56] .",

More specifically, we are interested in analyzing the effects that changes in host density may have on the virulence of the pathogen. In agricultural systems, humans have been maintaining animals and plants at very high densities for about 10,000 years, and humans themselves began living at high local densities in villages, towns and cities from about the same time [15] . Densities of both humans and domesticated organisms have probably increased continually since then, but the densities at which some domestic animals are kept appear to have increased very rapidly in the last few decades (see e.g. [22] , and the recent rapid development of large scale commercial aquaculture involves the maintenance of very high densities of a whole new set of marine species that will have their own pathogens (see [32, 31, 12] ). Thus the question arises as to whether high host densities are likely to lead to selection for more virulent strains of pathogens.",

This quantity can be used to determine which of the two types will become dominant in the population over time. One of the advantages of the branching process model is that one can easily incorporate in it two different characteristics of pathogenes' virulence: their lethality (which can be described by the mean survival time of an infected host) and transmissibility (specifying the probability of an infected host infecting a susceptible one on their contact), instead of representing them together by a single quantity termed simply \"virulence\" (cf. e.g. [1] ).

The convergence rate is clearly exponential: the remainder term decays as e \u2212\u2206t . Note also the obvious facts that R 1 (0) = 0, R 2 (0) = \u221e and that R 1 (t) (R 2 (t)) is an increasing (decreasing) function of t (so that always R 1 (t) < R 2 (t)).

Observe that the threshold value R = 1 (after which type 2 pathogen dominates the population) may play no critical role: our model is a crude approximation for the initial stage of an epidemic only, so R/(R + 1) will just give a proportion of the carriers of type 2 parasite in the population of the infected hosts at the end of that stage.

But how does the value of \u03bb relate to physically measurable parameters of the modelled situation -for instance, the density of fish in an aquaculture tank (given the tank size and all other parameters of the model are fixed) or the size of the tank (given the number of fish in it is fixed)?

A possible objection to the above simple aggregate model is that pathogens will not always mutate to become more lethal. The model can be further generalized by allowing, within each enclosure, mutations of our pathogen not only in the direction of higher lethality, but also in the opposite direction. So we will first have to generalize our basic model from Section 2 to a three-type branching process, assuming that, if an enclosure is infected with a pathogen with lethality \u03b1, then the pathogen can mutate to ones with lethalities r \u22121 \u03b1 and r\u03b1, respectively, where, as before, r > 1 is a fixed number (all other parameters being assumed equal for the different types of pathogens). Mathematically, analyzing such processes is essentially equivalent to what we did in Sections 2-4, although all the closed-from expressions will become much more complicated, and so we will not give much technical detail for brevity's sake. The main assertions concerning the asymptotic behaviour of the branching process will remain true: there will exist a limiting balance of types in the supercritical case (denote the shares of the different pathogens by \u03c0 j = \u03c0 j (\u03b1), j = 1, 2, 3, j \u03c0 j = 1), which can be found from the generator A of the semigroup of the mean matrices, and the almost sure convergence of the process scaled by e \u2212\u03c3 + t (as before, \u03c3 + denotes the Perron-Frobenius root of A) to a limiting random vector will hold.",

The mathematical models we presented show that, at the beginning stages of any epidemics that arise in situations where animals (or humans) live in enclosures, the density of hosts is an important factor in determining whether more or less lethal strains of the pathogen will predominate. The ratio of infections by more and less lethal pathogens stabilizes very fast, so that even if measures to prevent further spread of the disease are put in place as soon as an outbreak is identified (such as elimination of the animals in an enclosure), the relative frequency of pathogen types is likely to have changed before action is taken. Other key factors that can also contribute to the evolution of more lethal strains and their spread in the host population include transmissibility and mutation rates. Mutation rates are known to vary greatly between pathogens such as the flu virus, and others such as trematode worms (liver flukes, shistosomes etc., which reproduce more slowly).",

The problem has been recognized in intensive poultry production [51] . and the identification of more virulent trains of Marburg's disease in chickens [54] may also be an example of this process, and it seems possible that the advent of very virulent strains of bird flu during the Spanish Flu epidemic may be linked to high densities of soldiers in demobilization camps and troop ships, although these men may have been very susceptible due to their poor condition [45] .",

Density of the animal hosts may itself increase transmissibility, due to stress on the hosts caused by crowding [52] . Increased transmissibility might in turn lead to the evolution of increased lethality [20] . An interesting question is whether increased lethality would be linked in most cases to increased transmissibility.

Once a disease is detected in an enclosure, farmers would usually sacrifice or remove the animals, but pathogens may be carried between enclosures by various mechanisms, depending on the type of pathogen and the biosecurity practices followed). A multistage version of our model for this situation suggests that if pathogens are transferred a number of times, then the evolution of more lethal pathogens may be very rapid, but the increase in lethality will eventually lead to the epidemic becoming unsustainable (hosts dying too fast to be able to transit the pathogen).",

Thus the state space of the Markov chain is {0, 1, 2, . . . } and the only nonzero entries in the transition matrix P = [p j,k ] j,k\u22650 of the chain areFurther, in view of (18), one can assume that once the Markov chain {X n } has reached the state k * , the epidemic becomes unsustainable, and hence there will be no further transmission of the disease to other enclosures. So we can truncate our state space to {0, 1, 2, . . . , k * }, which results in a finite decomposable Markov chain with a single absorbing state k * . Whatever the current state of the chain, at the next step it can either stay at it or move to the right, the transition probabilities forming the matrixwhere T is the k * \u00d7 k * substochastic matrix formed by the first k * rows and k * columns of P , r = (0, . . . , 0, p k * \u22121,k * ) \u2208 R k * + and \u22a4 denotes transposition. The (random) number of steps T the chain will need to reach the absorbing state is nothing else but the total number of enclosures that will be affected by the epidemic prior to its collapse. Using our model, we can easily find the distribution of T .Indeed, using the standard approach to solving such problems (see e.g. p.80 in [39] ), we note that as the state k * is absorbing, we have Pr(T \u2264 n| X 0 = 0) = q (n) 0,k * , where q (n) jk are the n-step transition probabilities:so that for the probability mass vector function f (n) = {f j (n), j = 0, . . . , k * \u2212 1}, f j (n) = Pr(T = n| X 0 = j), one obtains f (n) = r n \u2212 r n\u22121 = r(T n\u22121 ) \u22a4 , n \u2265 1.Of course, we are only interested in the first entry of the vector f (n).To compute the mean and higher moments of T one can use the generating function f * (z) \u2261 \u221e n=1 z n f (n) = rz I \u2212 zT \u22a4 \u22121 , |z| \u2264 1.",
