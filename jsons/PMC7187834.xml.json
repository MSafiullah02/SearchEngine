She received her B.A. degree in biology in 1990 and her Ph.D. in parasitology from the same university in 1997. She has been the head of the Malaria Laboratory of the Parasitology Department at UFMG since 1997. Her research is focused on two distinct approaches: study of the immune response in human malaria and study of the diversity of avian malaria parasites in wild birds. She has spent the last 25 years studying the humoral and cellular immune responses among different populations in the Brazilian endemic Amazon region. Her current research interest includes the study of immunological mechanisms which determine anaemia in patients infected by Plasmodium vivax.",

            "text": "The ABO blood group system has been associated with severe disease in Plasmodium falciparum infections, pointing that individuals with A phenotype are at a higher risk to develop severe illness compared to type O phenotype. However, this protective effect of blood group O observed in falciparum malaria has never been demonstrated in malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax. Since immune response, life cycle and disease pathogenesis are different for both P. vivax and P. falciparum, we postulated that ABO blood groups influence clinical outcomes of Plasmodium infection in different manners. Because anaemia is one of the major complications of P. vivax infection, which is thought to arise from the destruction of both infected and non-infected red blood cells (RBCs), we decided to test in vitro mechanistic evidence in favour of higher susceptibility to healthy RBCs destruction by autoantibodies from P. vivax-infected patients from blood group O compared to patients of the blood group A.",
