The aim of this analysis is to determine the association of cardiovascular metabolic diseases with the development of COVID-19. Methods A meta-analysis of eligible studies that summarized the prevalence of cardiovascular metabolic diseases in COVID-19 and compared the incidences of the comorbidities in ICU/severe and non-ICU/severe patients was performed. Embase and PubMed were searched for relevant studies. Results A total of six studies with 1527 patients were included in this analysis. The proportions of hypertension, cardiacerebrovascular disease and diabetes in patients with COVID-19 were 17.1%, 16.4% and 9.7%, respectively. The incidences of hypertension, cardia-cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes were about twofolds, threefolds and twofolds, respectively, higher in ICU/severe cases than in their non-ICU/severe counterparts. At least 8.0% patients with COVID-19 suffered the acute cardiac injury. The incidence of acute cardiac injury was about 13 folds higher in ICU/severe patients compared with the non-ICU/severe patients. Conclusion Patients with previous cardiovascular metabolic diseases may face a greater risk of developing into the severe condition and the comorbidities can also greatly affect the prognosis of the COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 can, in turn, aggravate the damage to the heart.",

            "text": "In addition, as cardiologists, we are also concerned about whether patients with cardiovascular disease are at greater risk for 2019-nCoV, and whether new coronavirus infections have an impact on the cardiovascular system. Previous studies have shown a relationship between cardiovascular metabolic diseases and SARS and MERS [9] [10] [11] . A systematic analysis of 637 MERS-CoV cases showed that diabetes and hypertension are prevalent in about 50% of the patients and cardiac diseases are present in 30% of the cases [11] . Diabetes was seen as an independent predictor for mortality and morbidity in patients with SARS [9] . With the spread of 2019-nCoV and increase of the cases, more and more 2019-nCoV infected individuals exhibit comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes and cardia-cerebrovascular disease. In Chen's study of 99 cases, 40% patients had cardia-cerebrovascular disease [6] , and in Huang's study of 41 cases, 20% patients had diabetes [4] . These cardiovascular metabolic comorbidities might render them more susceptible to poor prognosis. Given the rapid spread of 2019-nCoV, an updated meta-analysis with significantly larger sample sizes by integrating the published studies is urgently warranted. Accordingly, the present analysis will not only identify the cardiovascular epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection with greater precision but also unravel the impact of the infection on the cardiac injury.",

There was a significant heterogeneity (Cochran's Q) in the estimates of comorbidities among the identified studies with an I 2 index varied from 47 to 95% (Fig. 2 ). We then compared the difference of the prevalence of the three diseases between severe patients and non-severe patients (or ICU patients vs non-ICU patients according to the data in the studies). For hypertension and cardia-cerebrovascular disease, the heterogeneity test results were calculated as I 2 = 47% and 26%. Thus, the fixed-effect model was used for further analyses. The results from the three included studies (with a total amount of 1278 patients) showed that hypertension accounted for 28.8% of ICU/ severe cases, but 14.1% of non-ICU/severe cases. A similar pattern was found in cardia-cerebrovascular disease statistics: it accounted for 16.7% of ICU/severe cases, but 6.2% of non-ICU/severe cases.

For diabetes, the heterogeneity test showed that I 2 = 67%, and so the random effect model was used. Diabetes accounted for 11.7% of ICU/severe cases, but 4.0% of non-ICU/severe cases. The result indicated a higher proportion of diabetes in ICU/severe patients but without statistical significance [RR = 2.21, 95% CI (0.88, 5.57), Z = 1.68, P = 0.09] (Fig. 2) .",

Thus, it is necessary for us to evaluate the prevalence of cardiac and metabolic diseases in COVID-19. The present systematic analysis summarized the data from all of the five studies of COVID-19. The results demonstrated that the overall proportion of hypertension, cardia-cerebrovascular disease and diabetes were, respectively, 17.1%, 16.4% and 9.7%. According to Summary of the 2018 report on cardiovascular diseases in China, the morbidities of the hypertension and diabetes were, respectively, 23.2% and 10.9%, and there were about 13 million of cerebrovascular disease patients and 11 million of cardiovascular patients [21] . Therefore, comparing the data to the report, we did not find that people with hypertension and diabetes were more susceptible to 2019-nCoV infection. The prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in people infected with the virus is about the same as in the general population, even slightly lower. However, comparing the general population, the incidence of cardia-cerebrovascular disease in patients with COVID-19 is obviously much higher.",

According to Oudit's study, SARS-CoV viral RNA was detected in 35% of autopsied human heart samples from SARS-CoV infected patients during the Toronto SARS outbreak [22] . And they also confirmed that pulmonary infection with the human SARS-CoV in mice led to an ACE2dependent myocardial infection [22] . ACE2 is an important target for SARS-CoV [23] , and molecular modelling has shown high structural similarity between the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV [24] . ACE2 expression is highly tissue-specific, mainly expressed in the cardiovascular, renal and gastrointestinal systems, with a small amount expressed in lung cells. Therefore, in addition to coronaviruses causing pneumonia through ACE2 receptors in lung epithelial cells, we also need to pay attention to possible viral effects on myocardial tissue. Second, hypoxaemia may be also an important reason of cardiac injury. In Huang's study, 32% COVID-19 patients had various degree of hypoxaemia and need required high-flow nasal cannula or higher-level oxygen support. In Chen's study, up to 76% of patients require oxygen therapy. Due to severe 2019-nCoV infection, the pneumonia may cause significant gas exchange obstruction, leading to hypoxaemia, which significantly reduces the energy supply by cell metabolism, and increases anaerobic fermentation, causing intracellular acidosis and oxygen free radicals to destroy the phospholipid layer of cell membrane. Meanwhile, hypoxia-induced influx of calcium ions also leads to injury and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. Third, Huang's study noted that high concentration of IL-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, IP-10 and MCP-1 could be detected in patients infected with 2019-nCoV, which might lead to activated T-helper-1 (Th1) cell responses [4] . Furthermore, they also found that ICU patients had much higher concentrations of inflammatory factors than those non-ICU patients, suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with disease severity [4] . In addition, repeated floods of catecholamines due to anxiety and the side effects of medication can also lead to myocardial damage.",
