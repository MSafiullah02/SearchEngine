Immune suppression may predispose to secondary infection, increasing the risk of morbidity and mortality [6] . There is also some evidence to suggest that perturbations of T cell subsets, in particular impaired activity of CD4\u00fe T cells and overactivation and exhaustion of CD8\u00fe T cells, eventually lead to a diminished host antiviral immunity.",

Pre-treatment lymphocytopenia, which has been identified as a poor prognostic factor in many malignancies, is probably a reflection of tumour-induced immune suppression [9] . In addition, it has been shown that posttreatment lymphocytopenia is associated with poorer outcomes in lung cancer patients treated with radical radiotherapy [12] . In this study, the dose delivered to the irradiated volume (described by the parameter integral body dose) was associated with lower post-treatment lymphocyte counts in lung cancer [12] . Therefore, radiation oncologists should be mindful of the possibility of radiotherapy-induced lymphocytopenia as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease in patients at risk of being exposed to the infection.",

Radiation oncologists define a high-risk CTV as the volume that comprises the radiologically visible tumour together with other tissues highly likely to contain tumour cells. This often includes tissues surrounding the visible tumour and adjacent lymph nodes. In some instances, a low-risk CTV is also defined and this volume encompasses tissues (often lymph nodes) at a lower risk of containing tumour cells than those within the highrisk CTV, but of sufficient risk to need prophylactic irradiation. Although the dose delivered to the low-risk CTV is significantly lower than that prescribed to the high-risk CTV, this results in an expanded total CTV.",

Treatment strategies that result in an expanded CTV, especially where the evidence of benefit is uncertain, should be avoided, both to keep the risk of treatment-induced lymphocytopenia as low as possible and to reduce the risk of toxicity, which could result in additional hospital visits. During these extraordinary times, it may be wise to avoid prophylactic pelvic nodal radiotherapy in localised prostate and bladder cancer, as the evidence of benefit for such a practice in these tumours is fraught with controversy [13, 14] . Careful consideration should be given to prophylactic irradiation of para-aortic lymph nodes in locally advanced cervical cancer as its benefit is equivocal [15] . In head and neck cancer, where there is some evidence of efficacy with prophylactic lymph node irradiation, we advocate careful evaluation of the potential risks and benefits on a patient by patient basis [16] . We also support the recommendation against radiotherapy to the axillary lymph nodes in early breast cancer patients treated with wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy and found to have one or two macrometastases [4] . There is a more compelling rationale for continuing to offer prophylactic radiotherapy to the internal mammary lymph nodes in patients with high-risk breast cancer (T4 and/or N2-3 disease), as absolute gains in disease-free survival has been shown [17] . However, we suggest carefully weighing the risks and benefits of internal mammary lymph node irradiation in patients with intermediate-risk disease (T3 and/or N1) and central or medial tumours on an individual basis.",

            "text": "Another novel strategy that has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19 pneumonia is low-dose radiotherapy to lungs [18] . The rationale for this approach stems from data suggesting that at doses in the range of 0.3e1 Gy, irradiation of the lungs could result in a reduced inflammation relief of lifethreatening symptoms in both bacterial and viral pneumonia. The published data suggest that the absolute risk of lymphocytopenia is associated with the pre-treatment lymphocyte count as well as the irradiated volume. Even though the prescribed dose is small, this would result in a large integral dose due to the large volume of irradiation and consequently would place patients at substantial risk of developing severe post-treatment lymphocytopenia, especially in a group of patients at high risk of pretreatment lymphocytopenia. It is beholden to all radiation oncologists to follow the principle of ALARA and to use as low a dose and volume as is reasonably possible, if at all. If studies in this space are to go ahead, then it may be better to try partial lung irradiation or even splenic irradiation, as the spleen is a reservoir for the immune cells responsible for the cytokine storm associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Those of us who follow events on social media will have seen much discussion about the potential role of radiation for COVID-19 pneumonia. In unprecedented times, it is tempting to reach for the stars, but we must do so from a platform of science. Caution is also welcome in these challenging times.",
