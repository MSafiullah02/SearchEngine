Of 54 volunteers inoculated with 100 TCID,, of human rhinovirus type 2 (HRV-21, 50 (96.6%) and 32 (59%) excreted antigen and virus on at least 1 of 3 days investigated, respectively. Thirty-three (61%) had significant rises in rhinovirus-specific IgA by ELISA. Twelve (22%) developed symptoms of colds. Generally the ELSA detected antigen more frequently in volunteers later in the course of infection and provided evidence of infection in a higher proportion of asymptomatic compared with symptomatic volunteers. On the other hand, virus isolation detected virus more frequently earlier i n the course of infection and in a higher proportion of symptomatic compared with asymptomatic volunteers. We conclude that rhinovirus antigen detection by ELISA is a simple, rapid, sensitive, and practical test to diagnose a rhinovirus infection and potentially a viable alternative to virus isolation.",

In the majority of individuals, the infection is subclinical or results in only mild upper respiratory tract symptoms characterised by rhinorrhoea, nasal obstruction, some element of pharyngitis, and cough. Fever or systemic reactions are infrequent [Al-Nakib and Tyrrell, 19881 . A number of reports suggest that rhinoviruses also cause lower respiratory tract infections [recently reviewed by Al-Nakib and Tyrrell, 19881. Indeed, recent community studies in Tecumseh, Michigan, in the United States, confirmed these early reports and showed that rhinoviruses frequently cause lower respiratory tract infections not only among in- fants and children but also among adults [Monto et al., 19871 . Furthermore, the median duration of illness among those aged over 40 years was as long as 3 weeks [Monto et al., 19871 . Another recent study suggests a significant association between rhinovirus infection and pulmonary disease in hospitalized infants and children [Krilov et al., 19861 . These studies, together with those of Gregg [1983] in which rhinoviruses were implicated in the exacerbation of episodes of bronchitis and asthma in children, confirm that rhinoviruses are capable of causing illnesses that are far more serious than is generally realised and therefore may require specific recognition and treatment.",

            "text": "Recently, there has been significant progress in the prophylaxis and treatment of acute respiratory virus infection, including those caused by rhinoviruses. For example, influenza A viruses can now be treated effectively with amantadine or rimantadine, while influenza B virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are sensitive to ribavirin [Bektimirov et al., 1985; Knight et al., 19861 . We recently reported a trial of a new synthetic antiviral, R61837, or 3-methoxy-6-[4-(3-methyl-pheny1)-1-piperazinyl] pyridazine, in which we found this new drug to be effective in preventing illness when given before virus challenge in volunteers [Al-Nakib et al., 19871 . It is envisaged that further progress in the field will lead to molecules that will also be effective in treating colds caused by rhinoviruses particularly in patients with lower respiratory tract complications. However, for the antiviral chemotherapy to be effective it would be important to identify rapidly the causative virus in order that the appropriate treatment be prescribed especially since these antivirals are highly specific in their action. Both influenza viruses and RSV can now be rapidly identified in nasopharyngeal aspi-rates by either immunofluorescence (IF) or ELISA [Orstavik et al., 1984; Grandien et al., 19851 . Rhinoviruses have \"traditionally\" been diagnosed either by virus isolation in a sensitive cell culture or by showing significant antibody rises by neutralisation tests or both [Hamparian, 19791. However, these procedures are laborious, require considerable expertise, and take some 2-3 weeks before a diagnosis is reached. We have recently developed a new ELISA system capable of detecting viral antigens directly in nasal secretions [Dearden and Al-Nakib, 19871 . In this study we report on the diagnostic potential of this new method when compared with that of virus isolation.",

A volunteer was considered infected if at least one of the three nasal wash samples was positive for the presence of virus or antigen and/or showed significant antibody rises in paired sera by ELISA (see below). Nasal washes from 40 volunteers who had been infected with other respiratory viruses such as influenza virus A (10 volunteers) or B (10 volunteers) or coronavirus (10 volunteers) or given only saline instead of virus (10 volunteers) were used as controls to check the specificity of the rhinovirus antigen assay.

            "text": "The data presented in this study show that the recently developed ELISA for rhinovirus antigen detection is generally more sensitive than virus isolation. Furthermore, it seems to detect antigen more frequently later during the course of infection. This finding is similar to that reported during the course of influenza virus infection. Berg et al. [1980] showed that an enzyme-linked fluorescent immune assay detected influenza antigen in nasal samples from only 6 of 12 (50%) volunteers on the second day after virus administration, whereas virus isolation was positive in 9 of 12 (75%). By 7 or 8 days after inoculation, however, all samples were negative by virus isolation, yet antigen was still detectable in nasal specimens from 6 (50%) and 5 (42%) of 12 volunteers, respectively [Berg et al., 19801 . Using synthetic oligonucleotides as probes, we, too, have recently found that although rhinovirus RNA could be detected as efficiently as virus by culture during the first 2-3 days after virus inoculation, more volunteers were positive for viral RNA by hybridization than for virus by culture on subsequent days [Bruce et al., 19891 . Furthermore, 54 of 57 (95%) volunteers inoculated with HRV-14 were positive on at least 1 day by hybridization, whereas virus was isolated from only 41 (74%) [Bruce et al., 19891 . These results are similar to those obtained by the ELISA in this study and show that both antigen and RNA detection may be more sensitive than virus isolation in establishing evidence of infection in a higher proportion of inoculated volunteers. Indeed, the ELISA seems to detect antigen more often in asymptomatic than in symptomatic volunteers (96% positive vs. 82% on any day). These results suggest that a very low-grade reproduction of virus may have taken place in the nasal epithelium of these individuals although virus was undetectable by isolation. Rhinovirus antigen was detected by ELISA in the nasal washings of 14 volunteers even though they did not excrete virus or show significant rises in rhinovirus-specific IgA. Four of these volunteers excreted antigen for 2 days and one for 3 consecutive days. Although it is possible that the ELISA may have falsely detected antigen in these individuals, this, we feel, is unlikely since the test was shown to be highly specific for rhinovirus and did not detect antigen falsely in any of the nasal washes from individuals who had been infected with influenza A or B virus or coronavirus and that were positive for the respective virus by culture. Moreover, all 10 nasal washing samples from the 10 individuals given saline instead of virus were also consistently negative for rhinovirus by this ELISA. It is, therefore, conceivable that antigen may have been present especially since these volunteers were in fact inoculated with HRV-2 (and one of them actually developed symptoms of cold without excreting virus or showing serological evidence of infection). The infection, however, may have been limited to little infectious virus being formed or neutralized by low titres of nasal antibody. If so, the antigenic load may not have been sufficient to stimulate a measurable immune response.",

It is sensitive, rapid, does not require considerable expertise, and could be adapted to large-scale epidemiological studies. However, we believe that further research is required to investigate optimal methods for specimen collection and processing, e.g., whether nasopharyngeal aspirates might be a better sample than washings. Moreover, release of adequate antigen in the sample by mechanical or chemical methods prior to testing may improve sensitivity. The antibody element in the test might be standardized by using monoclonal antibody reagents instead of polyclonal sera. Furthermore, since the present test is type specific, it would be important to identify a monoclonal antibody or a panel of monoclonal antibodies that detect C-type reactivity or other common epitopes found on most of the 100 rhinovirus serotypes.",
