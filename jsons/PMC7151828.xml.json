Over centuries of exploration and migration, diseases such as the plague, yellow fever, smallpox, malaria and cholera, and influenza spread around the world through travel. The time to circumnavigate the earth has decreased over the last one and a half centuries, from about 1 year to roughly 36 h \u2013 that is, to go from one spot on the globe to any other. Although today's travelers are better protected from ancient diseases by better sanitation, immunizations and prophylactic medication, they face the threat of acquiring new, emerging, and re-emerging illnesses such as drug-resistant tuberculosis and malaria, leptospirosis, tick-borne encephalitis, and novel respiratory illnesses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or even avian influenza (H5N1).2 In addition, and far more important in terms of traveler mortality, is the threat of problems such as injury (due to motor vehicle accidents) or the exacerbation of underlying illness (e.g. cardiac disease).",

This initial exploration into the prevention of travel-related illness has now grown in parallel with the escalation of travel itself, and has become a highly specialized area of medicine devoted to the maintenance of the health of international travelers through health promotion and disease prevention. It is still a fledgling multidisciplinary field encompassing a wide variety of specialties and subspecialties, including infectious and tropical diseases, public health and preventive medicine, primary care, and geographic, occupational, military, and wilderness medicine. For some time, travel medicine education has been incorporated into many infectious disease training programs.3 Also, travel medicine has broadened to include migration medicine, immigrant health, and has touched on the impact of travel on receiving countries. Unlike many other healthcare specialties, in a number of countries travel medicine is practiced by nurses, pharmacists and physicians alike.",

            "text": "The worldwide focus and knowledge base of travel medicine distinguishes it from other fields of medicine and nursing. Travel medicine practitioners must be aware of infectious disease risks and their magnitude, patterns of drug resistance, current outbreaks of illness, civil and military conflicts, and political barriers to travel at border crossings. In addition, they must have access to the most up-to-date information on travel-related vaccines and medications. For some travel medicine providers, the assessment and management of the ill-returned traveler is an important component of their responsibilities. The challenge remains that for practitioners in this new field there is still a relative paucity of texts, journals, courses and apprenticeships that are devoted to teaching the basics of travel medicine as well as the latest information in the field. Currently, there are only two journals devoted to travel medicine. In recent years, national travel medicine societies in various countries have emerged to provide a meeting place for those with similar interests in travel health. Also, the International Society of Travel Medicine was started in 1991 with a mission to address educational needs for professionals and the public. Their conferences, journal, and newsletter have provided a centralized place for the gathering of this unique body of information. In addition, along with the annual or biennial publication of authoritative information from institutions such as the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), new global surveillance systems, including GeoSentinel and TropNet Europe, have been developed to track travel-related morbidity, so that all can better understand the emerging health problems related to population movements. A GeoSentinel review of over 17 000 ill-returned travelers highlighted geographic-specific health risks such as malaria from sub-Saharan Africa, dengue from the Caribbean, Central America and SE Asia, typhoid from South Asia and African tick-typhus from Southern Africa.4 This and follow-up studies have confirmed that compared with the usual tourist, immigrants returning to their places of birth in developing countries, visiting friends and relatives, are at greater risk of malaria, typhoid fever, tuberculosis, intestinal parasites, and sexually transmitted infections.5\n",

Today, the focus of travel medicine is on recreational tourists, business persons, overseas volunteers, missionaries, the military, and migrant populations fleeing civil and other conflicts or looking for political asylum or economic opportunities. In addition, the current era of the increasing popularity of ecotourism and extreme travel has added a new dimension to the field, including the challenges faced as practitioners counsel increasing numbers of the elderly and the immunocompromised, such as those with HIV, cancer, autoimmune diseases, or organ transplants. The complexity and variety of travel itineraries, combined with the many health issues of enthusiastic travelers of all ages, shapes, and sizes, ensure that it takes much longer than appreciated to acquire the expertise necessary to provide travel medicine services. It is no longer adequate for advice to pass informally from friends, family, or travel counselors to travelers \u2013 or even from healthcare specialists in other fields to their patients \u2013 warning them only about the potential hazards of tap water! Indeed, data gathered over the last decade have clearly shown that health information for travel continues to be sought by far fewer travelers than it should. For example, depending on the study of travelers to malarious areas, only about 50% seek travel health advice, and far fewer are adherent to recommendations for chemoprophylaxis and insect protection.6., 7., 8. Data obtained from the CDC have shown that fewer than one-third of US travelers to areas of the world at risk for yellow fever have received the vaccine (Martin Cetron, personal communication, 2002). In addition, similar studies in several different countries show that travelers often seek their pre-travel health advice at the last minute, if at all.9., 10., 11.\n",
