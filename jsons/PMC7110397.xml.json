SARS spread from Guangdong province in China to more than 30 countries in late 2002, causing severe outbreaks of atypical pneumonia. Because both the virulence and the mortality rate of this virus are very high, it is important to understand the mechanisms of pathogenesis of SARS\u2010CoV infection for the prevention of SARS.",

Mitogen\u2010activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including p38, c\u2010Jun N\u2010terminal protein kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal\u2010related kinase (ERK) 1/2, and their MAPKKs, are activated in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected Vero E6 cells (Mizutani et al., 2004b). In particular, p38 is involved in induction of apoptosis because a p38 inhibitor was shown to partially prevent apoptosis induced by SARS\u2010CoV infection. Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)\u20103, which is ordinarily phosphorylated at a tyrosine residue in Vero E6 cells, is dephosphorylated by SARS\u2010CoV\u2010induced activation of p38 (Mizutani et al., 2004a). Akt, which has important antiapoptotic roles, is first phosphorylated at a single serine residue shortly after SARS\u2010CoV infection, and subsequently dephosphorylated during the course of viral infection (Mizutani et al., 2004c). However, threonine phosphorylation of Akt is not detected, and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)\u20103\u03b2, which is a downstream target of Akt, is slightly phosphorylated in virus\u2010infected cells, suggesting that Akt is unable to prevent virus\u2010induced apoptosis. Interestingly, both Akt and JNK signaling pathways are important for establishing persistent SARS\u2010CoV infection of Vero E6 cells (Mizutani et al., 2005). The weak activation of Akt in cloned Vero E6 cells cannot allow escape from SARS\u2010CoV\u2010induced apoptosis. Thus, the signaling pathway of apoptosis is stronger than the antiapoptotic pathway in virus\u2010infected Vero E6 cells. Recent studies showed that expression of nucleocapsid, X1, and spike proteins of SARS\u2010CoV can induce apoptosis in cells (2004, 2003, 2004, 2004). Interestingly, nucleocapsid protein induced apoptosis into COS\u20101 cells in the absence of growth factors, and both JNK and p38 MAPK were up\u2010regulated in nucleocapsid expressing cells, whereas ERK1/2 and Akt were down\u2010regulated (Surjit et al., 2004).",

            "text": "Akt activated by phosphatidylinositol 3\u2032\u2010kinase (PI3K) regulates cell proliferation, the cell cycle and cell survival. A number of proteins, such as Bad, caspase\u20109 and GSK\u20103\u03b2, have been identified as downstream targets of Akt (1998, 1998, 2000). These proteins are inactivated when phosphorylated by Akt. Activation of Akt by infection with a number of viruses has been reported previously. LMP\u20101 protein of Epstein\u2013Barr virus has been shown to bind to the p85 subunit of PI3K, resulting in activation of both PI3K and Akt (Dawson et al., 2003). The middle T antigen of murine polyomavirus and the X protein of hepatitis B virus also bind to the p85 subunit of PI3K, leading to activation of Akt (1998, 2001, 1985). Activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway by a variety of viruses is thought to be involved in the establishment of latent and chronic infections by allowing virus\u2010infected cells to escape from apoptosis. Activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway may lead to a delay in apoptosis of host cells, and the virus life cycle might be completed before apoptotic cell death of the host cells. Subsequent apoptosis facilitates the spread of the virus (Roulston et al., 1999). As described above, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway also promotes cell proliferation. Mirza et al. (2004) reported that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway cooperates with the ERK signaling pathway to promote cell cycle progression in both normal and cancer cells. GSK\u20103\u03b2 is a ubiquitously expressed protein\u2010serine/threonine kinase and its activity is inhibited by Akt phosphorylation (Cross et al., 1995). In addition, GSK\u20103 is now a well\u2010known key component in a large number of cellular processes and disease states, including p53, hypoxia, prions and endoplasmic reticulum stress (2002, 2003, 2002, 2002). The effects of activation of GSK\u20103\u03b2 are mediated through phosphorylation and proteolytic turnover of cyclin D1 (Diehl et al., 1998), resulting in the induction of cell cycle arrest via prevention of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb) hyperphosphorylation.",

Furthermore, we showed that Akt was dephosphorylated without any increase in its phosphorylation upon SARS\u2010CoV infection in subconfluent cultures of Vero E6 cells, in contrast to the tentative up\u2010regulation of phosphorylation of Akt prior to dephosphorylation in confluent cultures of these cells. In our previous study, we showed that caspase\u20103, which is one of the key factors in apoptosis, was activated within 18 h postinfection (p.i.) in virus\u2010infected cells. Thus, both acute dephosphorylation of Akt and apoptotic events are likely to contribute to the inhibition of cell proliferation of SARS\u2010CoV infected Vero E6 cells.",

The amount of phosphorylated Akt of mock\u2010infected subconfluent cells was 4.8\u2010fold higher than that of SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected confluent cells. GSK\u20103\u03b2 was also dephosphorylated in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected subconfluent cells. We next investigated whether Akt was phosphorylated in virus\u2010infected subconfluent cell cultures before 7 h p.i. The phosphorylation level of Akt\u2010serine was not up\u2010regulated at 2, 4 or 6 h p.i. (data not shown). The phosphorylation of GSK\u20103 were also similar at 2 and 6 h p.i. (data not shown). In addition, phosphorylation level of Akt kinase did not significantly change from 7 to 23 h p.i. (data not shown). These results suggested that SARS\u2010CoV infection induces dephosphorylation of a serine residue of Akt in subconfluent cultures, without tentative up\u2010regulation of phosphorylation prior to dephosphorylation.",

As indicated in our previous study, apoptotic events progress in virus\u2010infected cells. Therefore, these findings strongly suggested that both events Akt\u2010dephosphorylation and apoptosis are responsible for the inhibition of cell proliferation in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected cells. We feel that transcriptional activity in virus\u2010infected cells is important for understanding the viability of cells. Cinatl et al. (2004) demonstrated that SARS\u2010CoV infection regulates cellular gene expression in a SARS\u2010CoV\u2010permissive cell line, Caco\u20102, at 24 h p.i. using high\u2010density oligonucleotide arrays. We focused on up\u2010regulated genes related to transfection factors, because several signaling pathways, which generally play important roles in the activation of transcription factors, are activated in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected Vero E6 cells. We selected 14 genes (including the housekeeping gene, GAPDH) that were shown previously to be up\u2010regulated by several stimuli (Cinatl et al., 2004), and semiquantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT\u2010PCR) was performed using total RNA extracted from virus\u2010infected confluent Vero E6 cells at 24 h p.i. The amount of total RNA was adjusted by the level of ribosomal RNA (Fig. 6s). Figure 6(b,c) shows genes that were down\u2010regulated and that showed similar expression upon SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infection compared to mock\u2010infected cells, respectively. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, Ets variant gene 5, Zinc finger protein 384 and GAPDH were down\u2010regulated in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected cells. These results suggested that transcriptional shut\u2010off occurred in particular (or in many) cellular mRNAs due to SARS\u2010CoV infection, and that virus\u2010infected cells are not proliferative due to Akt dephosphorylation and apoptosis.",

Akt\u2010phosphorylation is up\u2010 and down\u2010regulated by virus infection in the confluent cells, as shown in our previous report (Mizutani et al., 2004), but is down\u2010regulated by virus infection in subconfluent cells. Therefore, one of the aims of the present study was to determine whether SARS\u2010CoV has the potential for up\u2010 or down\u2010regulation of Akt\u2010phosphorylation in Vero E6 cells. Akt was phosphorylated in growing mock\u2010infected cells (i.e. 30% confluency), whereas it was dephosphorylated in confluent cell cultures. An Akt\u2010binding protein, carboxyl\u2010terminal modulator protein (CTMP), is a well\u2010known negative regulatory component of the Akt (Maira et al., 2001). CTMP, which binds to Akt, reduces the activity of Akt by inhibiting phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues. We found that the level of CTMP was below the limit of detection at 0\u201324 h p.i. in subconfluent virus\u2010infected cells (data not shown), suggesting that dephosphorylation of Akt in subconfluent cell cultures upon viral infection was not regulated by CTMP. Although we obtained proteins from SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected cells at different time points from 5 to 24 h p.i. in at least six experiments and performed western blot analysis using anti\u2010phospho Akt (Ser) antibody, we were not able to find up\u2010regulation of Akt\u2010phosphorylation in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected subconfluent Vero E6 cells. Therefore, we concluded in this study that SARS\u2010CoV has a potential of down\u2010regulation of Akt\u2010phosphorylation. It may be possible that SARS\u2010CoV infection induces activation of Akt phosphatase(s).",

We could not find any up\u2010regulated genes in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected Vero E6 cells, in contrast with SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected Caco\u20102 cells, in which several genes were demonstrated to be up\u2010regulated (Cinatl et al., 2004). This may have resulted from the faster progression of apoptosis and more rapid production of virus particles in infected Vero E6 as compared with Caco\u20102 cells. Thus, transcriptional shut\u2010off in virus\u2010infected cells may prevent cell proliferation with dephosphorylation of Akt.",
