This contamination is associated with inadequate public sanitation and low standards of personal hygiene. Defecation near pools and streams that are sources of water for domestic use is common, and simple sewage disposal systems often empty feces into the domestic water supply of the community. Person-to-person spread of infection also occurs. Seafoods such as shellfish, mussels and crabs transmit viruses causing gastroenteritis, Vibrio cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus. Flies carry bacteria from feces to food, on their mouthparts and legs. Low standards of kitchen hygiene in homes and public eating places also encourage transmission of intestinal infection. Precooked food kept warm for long periods may transmit a number of gut pathogens and contain enterotoxin formed by staphylococci growing in warmed food. Poultry and eggs are important sources of nontyphoidal salmonellae and campylobacter. An important and avoidable source of intestinal infection in infants results from bottle-feeding with powdered milk solution instead of breastfeeding. Unsterile bottles and nipples and contaminated water all contribute to the considerable risk of gut infection.",

Culture of stool samples or rectal swabs gives the bacteriologic diagnosis.

Community health providers can distribute oral rehydration salts (ORS) and teach others how to make and give the solution. The formulation recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) contains the following: a sugar such as glucose, which facilitates the absorption of sodium and water in the small intestine; sodium and potassium, to replace gastrointestinal losses of these electrolytes; and citrate or bicarbonate, which helps correct the acidosis that develops as a result of diarrhea. ORS solution is absorbed in the small bowel even in the presence of severe diarrhea.

While patients with peptic ulcer may be asymptomatic, the usual symptom is epigastric discomfort or pain, which may radiate to the back. The four major complications are hemorrhage, penetration, perforation, and gastric outlet obstruction. Bleeding peptic ulcer is a common cause of acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage; management consists of hemodynamic resuscitation, endoscopic therapy, and, for refractory cases, surgery. Treatment with a proton pump inhibitor reduces the risk of rebleeding after endoscopic hemostasis. Penetration of the ulcer through the bowel wall causes intense pain; further erosion results in bowel perforation, causing peritonitis and necessitating emergency laparotomy. Gastric outlet obstruction is usually a complication of a longstanding ulcer, due to chronic inflammation and fibrosis. A test for H. pylori should be performed in all patients with peptic ulceration; this may be performed either at endoscopy or noninvasively. If positive, eradication of H. pylori should be undertaken; this should consist of a proton pump inhibitor and two antibiotics, taking into account local resistance patterns.

Variously referred to as tropical sprue or tropical enteropathy, the disorder is characterized by a chronic malabsorption syndrome, either following an episode of acute infectious diarrhea or developing more insidiously; it has even been reported to develop years after leaving an endemic area. Its incidence appears to be decreasing, mainly as a result of the increasing recognition of nontropical sprue, or celiac disease, and perhaps also due to the increasing use of antibiotics for patients with acute diarrheal diseases. It occurs in the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and some parts of the Caribbean; however, it is not endemic in all tropical areas, being notably rare or absent in Africa and other parts of the Caribbean such as Jamaica. There is considerable heterogeneity in disease presentation among these areas, suggesting that tropical sprue may represent a spectrum of related disorders. The etiology is unknown, but infectious etiologies are considered likely given the epidemiology of the disease and its response to antibiotics; although a number of infectious agents have been implicated, there has been little consistency between studies. In addition, folate deficiency has been implicated in the etiology of tropical sprue, given the prevalence of folate deficiency in these patients and the histologic improvement observed upon folic acid repletion; this and other theories \u2013 for example, implicating malnutrition or excess T-cell activity \u2013 are flawed due to the inability to separate cause from effect. The clinical, laboratory and endoscopic features of tropical sprue are largely similar to those of celiac disease. While the mucosal lesion can be patchy in both conditions, the villous atrophy in tropical sprue tends to be less severe \u2013 with a flat mucosa being uncommon \u2013 but more diffuse throughout the small intestine. The key factors distinguishing tropical sprue from celiac disease are the absence of celiac disease-specific autoantibodies and the absence of clinical and histologic improvement on a gluten-free diet. Thus, tropical sprue is a diagnosis of exclusion, suggested by villous atrophy in a patient with malabsorption who is living or has lived in an endemic area. The disease can be cured with antibiotics, usually tetracycline for up to 6 months, in combination with folic acid.",

Inflammation of the appendiceal wall leads to ischemia, necrosis, and eventually perforation, which may result in a localized abscess or generalized peritonitis. The inciting event is obstruction of the appendix, which is commonly due to fecaliths or calculi. However, the cause of the appendiceal obstruction varies by age, with lymphoid hyperplasia being common in children and tumors occasionally found in adults. In areas where schistosomiasis is endemic, schistosome ova have been found in the appendiceal wall in patients undergoing appendectomy, suggesting a potential causative role for certain parasitic infestations in the pathogenesis of acute appendicitis. Regardless of the etiology, the clinical features of acute appendicitis are similar: the classic symptoms include pain that migrates from the periumbilical area to the right iliac fossa, fever, anorexia and vomiting, though the diagnosis may be more challenging in children and the elderly who present with less specific features. Laboratory findings are nonspecific, though a leukocytosis is usually present. In areas with access to radiographic studies, ultrasonography or computed tomography may establish the diagnosis, though imaging should not delay surgical exploration in cases where the diagnosis of acute appendicitis is very likely based on the clinical assessment. For patients presenting soon after the onset of symptoms, the treatment of choice is immediate appendectomy, with the addition of broad-spectrum antibiotics in those with frank perforation; patients with a longer duration of symptoms may be managed non-operatively with antibiotics. The differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis includes acute gastroenteritis, in which diarrhea is usually a prominent symptom and abdominal pain is more diffuse. In contrast, gastroenteritis due to Yersinia infection may present with little diarrhea and right lower quadrant abdominal pain, causing it to be misdiagnosed as appendicitis.",

Less than half of patients with intestinal tuberculosis have open pulmonary disease. Laboratory tests usually reveal anemia and raised inflammatory markers, though these are nonspecific. Tuberculin tests are usually strongly positive in patients who are adequately nourished but are frequently negative in those with malnutrition or HIV infection. Sputum and gastric washings should be examined for tubercle bacilli. Radiographic contrast studies of the gut show a range of changes, including mucosal ulceration, stricture formation, segmental narrowing, and fistula formation. Colonoscopy may establish the diagnosis when acid-fast bacilli or caseating granulomas are found on biopsy; however, these findings are not always present, and other endoscopic findings can be difficult to distinguish from other diseases of the colon, most notably Crohn's disease.
