Plague is believed to have originated in Asia. It ravaged Asia, the Middle East, and Europe between the 1300s and 1844 and remains endemic to parts of Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas even today. The worst recorded epidemic, the Black Death, peaked in Europe between 1347 and 1351 and killed between one quarter to one third of the population in Europe and the Middle East (Watts 1997). The disease spread along trade routes over land and sea. In addition to being one of the earliest recorded pandemics, plague was also one of the earliest documented agents of biological warfare. In 1346, the Tartars laid siege to the city of Caffa. The Tartar community had suffered from the plague. They engaged in battle against the Genoese, who were secured in the walled city of Caffa. The Tartars reportedly catapulted plague-ridden bodies over the city walls hoping to disable their enemy with disease (Wheelis 2002). As the Genoese returned home to Italy, they carried the plague with them. The disease quickly established a foothold and spread throughout Europe.",

Quarantine, derived from the Italian quaranta giorni, or forty days, is the separation of individuals who have been exposed to a disease but have not yet developed symptoms from contact with other unexposed individuals. Isolation refers to physically separating people who develop a specific disease from contact with others. The city-states of Italy established Public Health Councils to address the health threat posed by plague (Gomez-Dantes 2001; Watts 1997). The City of Venice instituted a formal quarantine system to control the plague epidemic. Under the quarantine law, incoming ships had to remain at anchor for forty days before they would be allowed to dock. Health regulations in Italy included sanitation (disposal of bodies), limiting movement of infected and exposed individuals, financing of medical care, and economic support for those impacted by market closure (Watts 1997). Proscriptions against population movement were adopted throughout plague-ridden areas. Other actions included closing marketplaces and cordoning off entire cities, limiting trade, domestic and international mobility.",

            "text": "Over time, quarantine regulations became the most powerful tool the international community had to limit the spread of infectious disease. Quarantine and isolation were used against such diseases as cholera and yellow fever in the 1800s. The growth of interstate commerce and travel during the Industrial Revolution along with the coalescence of modern nation-states, contributed to a growing call for international coordination of health responses. The European cholera epidemic (1830\u20131847) led to the first International Sanitary Conference in 1851. Representatives from 11 European nations developed transnational quarantine policy (Stern and Markel 2004). Interamerican cooperation solidified under the aegis of the Pan American Sanitary Bureau (Stern and Markel 2004). In Europe, the (OIHP) in Paris became the chief coordinator of public health activities, such as monitoring and assessing disease occurrence and possible risk factors, providing technical advice to address health risks and improve health outcomes, and coordinating different actors to address specific health threats. Additionally, the OIHP had the authority to convene meetings, draw up international conventions, and administer quarantines (Gomez-Dantes 2001; Stern and Markel 2004). The League of Nations Health Organization (LNHO) formed in 1922, providing health supports which were parallel to the OIHP. In the years following the first world war, OIHP came to dominate quarantine policy while the LNHO began looking at disease prevention and health promotion. The LNHO also began efforts to address social determinants of health, and the specific vulnerabilities of motherhood, childhood and poverty (Gillespie 2002; Gomez-Dantes 2001; Stern and Markel 2004).",

Social medicine holds that social forces such as income, ethnicity, and institutional arrangements create social inequity from which health inequity follows. This medical perspective represents a broad reinterpretation of public health etiology in which disease comes about via a three-way relationship between agent, host, and environment. It was a subject of debate in the late 1800s and then re-emerged in health rhetoric following World War I, challenging the exclusivity of focus as practiced by adherents of bacteriology and germ theory. A division in the health community emerged between those who focus on the individual causes of ill health and those who focus on social causes. This division influenced rhetoric and policy throughout the 20th century into the 21st century.",

            "text": "During the 1920s and 1930s, the LNHO, under the leadership of Ludwik Rajchman, expanded the organization\u2019s scope of concern beyond that of disease control, medical nomenclature and drug standardization to include emphasis on economic needs, employment, nutrition and social insurance as important constituents of good health (Gillespie 2002; Kunitz 2007). Social insurance was more than state-sponsored insurance, which had been gaining adherents at the turn of the century. provided for government-funded medical care of the poor and sick through municipal clinics, free hospitals and convalescent homes. Countries such as Germany, France and Russia were early innovators in such practice. Despite such efforts, however, care was fragmentary. State efforts were frequently small compared to private care provided by charitable or religious organizations or private fee-for-service care that precluded the poor. Social insurance, or social welfare, expanded the notion of state insurance to include other social aspects. It is a social safety net which includes income support, nutritional support, provision of housing and access to medical care for highly vulnerable populations such as the elderly (who no longer earn income), women, children and the poor whose physical or social circumstances prevent equal ability to access essential goods. Deficiencies in these goods make people more susceptible to death and disease; those highly vulnerable groups have fewer resources with which to mitigate harmful outcomes. In some cases, they are less able to respond to risks because of physical reasons. For example, women of childbearing age may be particularly vulnerable to physical conditions associated with childbearing, such as nutritional deficiencies, which can compromise their immune systems and make them susceptible to other diseases. These populations may be more vulnerable because of social or institutional structures as well. Consider the legal status of women in some areas following World War II where women were not allowed to enter the work force either because of formal rules or informal social norms. Those women who had engaged in work as part of the war effort were expected to return home at war\u2019s end. Their means of economic support was tied to spousal income or family wealth. In some regions, women were not allowed to own property. With no independent means of support, women were dependent upon the largess of men or upon social policies which would provide access to material support.",

The growth of social medicine, state insurance and social insurance was a countervailing force to the biomedical perspective that concentrated on a specific disease and a pharmacopic or biophysical cure. In social medicine, health became entwined with labor, employment, and the political economy\u2014in other words with the broader development landscape. Although full agreement as to the inclusion of social insurance within the health policy domain and purview of LNHO was never fully accepted, the debate about the appropriate catchment area for health had begun. The LNHO, the International Labor Organization (ILO) and a number of nation-states entered the fray. Support for social insurance was especially strong in a number of European states. This expanded conceptualization of health and the role of government in providing access to health care and more expansive social welfare continues to be debated in international and domestic spheres even today.",

The self reflection begged the question as to why certain areas of the world prospered and achieved certain standards of living, whereas other parts of the world did not. Development economics and development studies grew out of these post-war and post-colonial concerns. Development studies were initially dominated by western intellectual traditions and a conceit that the standards and norms achieved in the western world were highly desirable and should be replicated throughout the world. This intellectual bent has influenced and continues to exert pressure on international norms and the development agenda in the IOs. Neo-Marxism, post-modernism, and feminism have posed modest challenges to this tradition, but by and large development programs remain firmly entrenched in Western economic and political thought.",

Its mission was much like the LNHC before it: to monitor and analyze international health threats, to standardize professional nomenclature, and to provide technical guidance for disease management. The ideal of the intrinsic value of health was always at the forefront of the WHO mission; programmatically, however, the WHO focused on health as a narrowly defined outcome of human and infective agents. Even before the final charter was signed, the Interim Commission of WHO identified communicable diseases as the primary threat to global health (Gomez-Dantes 2001). Malaria was first among these concerns, followed by tuberculosis and \u2018venereal disease\u2019 (Gomez-Dantes 2001). During the 1950s and 1960s the WHO embraced the health revolutions provided by technological advancement and focused on the eradication of specific diseases to the exclusion of economic or social constituents of health. Vaccination, antibiotics, and insecticides became the tools for global campaigns to combat infectious disease. The focus provided mixed success. An anti-yaws campaign proved highly successful. Campaigns to decrease the health burden of measles and control wild polio had initial success. Later years, however, would see failures of measles vaccination and the emergence of wild polio albeit at a significantly lower rate than that experienced prior to the WHO campaign.",

Malaria was an enemy of colonial expansion, an enemy of states made free following the war, an enemy of those living in tropical and temperate climates. It is a parasitic disease spread to humans via mosquito bites. Although the disease had been the target of regional eradication efforts for considerable time, technological innovations of the mid-century combined with international organization suggested that this old enemy could be destroyed once and for all (Gilles and Warrell 1993; Najera-Morrondo 1991). The campaign entailed widespread use of chemicals, in particular, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), to kill vectors. Prophylactics would eliminate the human reservoir. The vision of health with the anti-malaria campaign presented health as an outcome included agent, host and a broader ecology. During the post war years, malaria was eradicated in the United States, parts of Europe, and the Middle East, and declined in parts of Latin America and some parts of Asia (Gilles and Warrell 1993; Newman 1965). No such success was experience in Africa and other parts of Asia. By the 1970s, temporary gains began to erode and the disease resurged in Latin America and Asia. Today, an estimated 250 million people are infected each year, and almost one million people, mostly children, die (WHO 2009c). Social and economic costs are manifold.",

Primary care services are often among the most cost effective interventions in that the inputs are low cost and result in direct cost saving through prevention or mitigation of more severe health sequelae, and result in indirect savings in terms of opportunities costs. When we consider global change in primary care since the 1970s, global immunization coverage and improved access to safe water and sanitation are clear achievements. But the full promise of primary care is yet to be realized and gains that have been made are threatened. Economic contraction and declining GDPs mean that financing for primary care is in jeopardy; national revenue is more tightly constrained and competition for resources is greater, and foreign aid is neither sufficient nor sustainable (WHO 2008a, b).

Maternal health is one of the more sensitive indicators of human development in that it reflects access to skilled health services, pre- and postnatal care, nutrition, education, female empowerment, social and economic development. Maternal health is considered important for its intrinsic value and for the multiplier effect it has on child and household health and attendant societal impacts.

When maternal health complications do not kill, they can damage a woman physically, emotionally and socially. Birth complications can damage a woman\u2019s reproductive organs. If the damage is severe enough, the woman may not be able to have children, and may therefore lose social status and economic protection. Obstetric fistulas are another complication which, if not surgically mended, cause loss of bladder or bowel control among other sequelae.

Complications which occur during pregnancy rather than during childbirth are difficult to measure but are believed to account for one out of every four maternal deaths (WHO 2007). A study in Zambia found that 40% of the referrals made to a teaching hospital were related to pregnancy complications, not childbirth (WHO 2007). Such complications may be a result of a condition developing because of the pregnancy. For example, a woman may develop high blood pressure related to the pregnancy. Disease and pre-existing conditions also cause complications during the course of pregnancy. Malaria, anemia and maternal malnutrition can be exacerbated by pregnancy and result in maternal mortality, still birth, and infant mortality. An estimated 10,000 women die each year during pregnancy as a result of malaria (WHO 2007). HIV is another complicating factor in maternal and infant mortality.",

These data reflect the dismay of the international community which found little to cheer about in terms of progress in maternal health. Some regions demonstrated improvement in maternal health. South-east Asia, for example, improved access to antenatal care, that is care received during pregnancy, by 34% (WHO 2005c). But during the same period, African nations improved access by only 4% (WHO 2005c). Only a third of births in Niger are attended by skilled health personnel (Save the Children 2008). Between 1990 and 2005, maternal mortality ratios declined by 5.4% (WHO 2007). The largest decline was in East Asia (47.1%), the smallest in Sub-Saharan Africa (1.8%) (WHO 2005a, b, c). Around the world more than half a million women will die because of poor maternal health care and ten million will suffer pregnancy-related injuries (WHO 2007). Ninety-nine percent of these deaths will occur to women living in developing countries (WHO 2007). One million children will be left motherless (WHO 2010). Maternal Mortality Ratios (MMR), the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births (or 1000 depending upon conversion), are as high as 2100 per 100,000 live births in Sierra Leone, 1800 in Afghanistan and Niger, and greater than 1000 in several African nations (WHO 2007). Progress has been slow and uneven. Figure 2.1 shows the unequal progress in reducing maternal mortality by region. The global community agreed it could do better. It committed to improving maternal care with the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 5 to reduce 1990 MMRs by 3/4 by 2015.\n",

Family planning includes access to knowledge about reproduction as well as access to birth control methods. Although access to contraception has risen from 10% of the population in the 1960s to 59% of the population, there remains a large gap between need and availability. An estimated 87 million unwanted pregnancies occur each year; there are 46 million abortions of which some 40% are unsafe (WHO 2005c). Addressing family planning includes education and access, but it also includes looking at the position women have in any given society. Family planning and abortion services continue to be controversial around the world.

The social aspect is more difficult to address. Maternal health care needs to involve societal knowledge of pregnancy and birth, societal norms about health seeking behavior, and critically, the empowerment of women. Where women do not have the same legal rights as men, or are not valued socially as much as men, they may be excluded from care (WHO 2005c). Social norms may dictate what is appropriate care for a woman, and may dictate whether or not she may show pain let alone be allowed to seek care. Where women do not have equal decision-making powers or are excluded from economic and social circles and hierarchies because of gender, their health may be jeopardized. They may also be subjected to violence and abuse. Such disempowerment is magnified if the women are poor (WHO 2005c). Societal and cultural change is difficult to realize as they entail changing norms and behaviors at individual, community, national and global scales. Further, there is no one \u2018true\u2019 approach to health care and behavioral change. The challenge of maternal health care is to address such care as a scaling up of a basic entitlement or human right rather than to caste such programs as health initiatives which target a specific sub-population particularly one which is not empowered politically (WHO 2005c). Only through such high level and large scale buy-in of the program can sufficient support be garnered and directed to provide care for women.",

Between 1967 and 1977 smallpox was eradicated thanks to a global effort which included widespread vaccination programs. This victory proved that global coordination of health care could take on and overcome a centuries-old killer. It was both a symbolic and real victory which provided momentum to the EPI established in 1974 under the aegis of WHO and UNICEF. The EPI principles entailed establishing routine childhood immunization for six of the most relevant vaccine-preventable diseases: measles, polio, diphtheria, pertussis, tuberculosis and tetanus. The logic of the program was manifold. First, immunization would increase the likelihood of childhood survival and was thus an investment in the future. Second, decreases in infant mortality are associated with declining total fertility and movement along the demographic transition. This in turn relates to lower dependency ratios and improved standard of living and improved human development within the broader population (WHO 2001, 2009a). Third, vaccinations are an efficient public health intervention in that there is a targeted group, minimal contact with the health system is necessary, and no major lifestyle changes are required (WHO 2009a). Fourth, vaccination programs benefit the individual who receives the vaccine as well as the broader community through herd immunity. Thus, immunizations were a public good. Fifth, immunization is cost effective. In the mid-1990s, the cost for the six basic EPI vaccines was US$1 per child (WHO 2005a).",

The primary obstacle was that the necessary vaccines were manufactured in the developed world but would be used in the developing world (Lee et al. 1997). Technological transfer for vaccination campaigns entailed the costs of the vaccines as well as the logistical support to transport and administer vaccines while maintaining cold chain and ensuring trained personnel managed the programs (Lee et al. 1997). To meet these challenges, the WHO, UNICEF and their partner agencies created innovative processes and partnerships. Initial financial obstacles were overcome through bilateral and multilateral aid and donations. The actors developed public-private partnerships to provide low cost equipment to transport and store vaccines while maintaining the cold chain (Lee et al. 1997). Procedures for vaccine administration and personnel training were established. Monitoring and surveillance followed. The administrative mechanisms were in place to evaluate program successes and failures, and modify approaches as programs became established and data gathered. For example, during national immunization days all children under age 5 receive polio vaccines regardless of previous vaccination status (Keegan and Bilous 2004). This innovation created a larger population catchment and circumvented the difficulties associated with vaccination eligibility tied to paper records. In-country vaccination networks provided an established health system which can be utilized to deliver other health care (Lee et al. 1997).",

The success of the vaccination programs was partially dependent upon foreign aid and multilateral funding, funds which are unsustainable. Further, as nations experienced economic contraction or fought wars, prioritization changed and funding for primary health care eroded. The economics of vaccination campaigns have also changed. Vaccination costs for the initial six targeted diseases were low and there was an economy of scale. Newer vaccines are more expensive. The cost of a hepatitis B vaccine, including administering the vaccine, are between US$ 20\u2014US$ 40 per child, an expense beyond the ability of some nations to pay (WHO 2005a). Global alliances have formed to try to overcome some of the obstacles to obtaining and maintaining high levels of vaccination coverage. For example, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) provides funds to poor counties with low vaccination coverage. It also brought together public and private actors to address development and sustainability of vaccines for both the developing and developed world.",

Vaccination programs targeting children are widespread with visible impact on morbidity and mortality. Maternal health is less clearly defined and associated with no single intervention. Vaccination entails a one (to three) time encounter with the medical system; maternal health entails a bare minimum of one but frequently more contacts. There is also a difference in terms of the political value placed upon children as opposed to women which differs from nation to nation. Obstacles of maternal health include a dearth of basic medical materials and training. None the less, poor countries such as Mozambique are investing in low cost medical training for nursing assistants and mid-wives. The logistical and technical obstacles are certainly no greater than those initially faced by EPI. Perhaps the ultimate barrier is political will to value women as much as children, and rearrange power structures and norms to ensure women equal chances of living health filled lives.",

The WHO has been more successful in operationalizing health as an outcome related to the control of specific diseases and ascribing value to states and a planet free from certain diseases both in terms of alleviating suffering, thus ensuring health as a right, and protecting various social and economic interests. The end of the 20th century saw a renewed interest in the linkage between socioeconomic, political and physical environment and health outcomes captured in studies of social epidemiology and the language of social determinants of health, as well as health as an input into the same. The work of medical anthropologists such as Nancy Scheper-Hughes, Arthur Kleinman and Paul Farmer became greatly influential in reconsidering the micro- and macro-level factors which alter health outcomes of entire groups of people and contribute to what Kim (2000a) refers to as the deserted places: areas in which health declines even while health indicators for the broader community improves. Epidemiology, the field of medicine which specifically examines the occurrence and distribution of disease within a population, began looking beyond the more traditional environmental determinants to the broader social order and its influence in creating risk exposures in susceptible populations. The sub-field of social epidemiology, which examines \u201c\u2026 how social conditions give rise to patterns of health and disease in individuals \u2026\u201d, became firmly established (Berkman and Kawachi 2000:10). Health was once again understood to be the product of numerous factors but increasingly these factors were seen to occur outside the geographic and institutional boundaries of any one nation state. Of growing concern was the role macro-economic policy had in creating vulnerabilities and limiting the ability of nation-states, local communities and individuals to respond to health risks.",

            "text": "The outcomes of the SAPs are heavily debated. The achievements of the SAPs may best be measured by looking at long-term economic trends. Over the course of ten to twenty years, some countries which implemented these programs achieved economic growth and modest improvement in GDP/capita (see Table 2.1). Living standards increased in conjunction with rising national income (Kunitz 2007). However, the question as to whether or not such growth was worth the price paid, especially by the poor, remains subject to debate. The SAPs have been widely criticized for causing social strife and failing to achieve their stated goals. The SAPs did not reduce the debt burden of the nations the programs were intended to help. In fact, by 1997, in numerous cases debt had grown (Gershman and Irwin 2000). The programs removed the public safety nets for the poor and created \u2018health shocks\u2019 in which health indicators actually got worse, albeit for a brief period of time (Armada et al. 2001; Kim et al. 2000b; Oppong 2001; World Bank 2004). The programs undermined investment in growth and in some cases, by undermining human development and removing the human benefits of a welfare state, set countries back in terms of development (Farmer and Bertrand 2000; Gershman and Irwin 2000). The programs also resulted in unequal growth, rising inequality and exacerbated poverty (Armada et al. 2001; Farmer and Bertrand 2000; Oppong 2001; World Bank 2004). Further, it is argued that the programs violated the international principle of sovereignty in that the national governments had little leeway in negotiating the SAP conditions. Critics argue that such conditions were set to further hegemonic interests of the United States and other large economic powers which control IMF and World Bank policy through an unequal voting structure (Armada et al. 2001).\n",

The bank continues to work with issues of macro-economic stability but its strategies evolved to incorporate lessons learned from the failures of the SAPs, and to provide supports for vulnerable populations. The more recent Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) places a premium on protecting social supports for the vulnerable, targeting programs to benefit the poor, and includes a participatory process in which national and community stake-holders are represented in policy debate and roll-out. PRS have been praised for allowing nation-states greater flexibility in agenda setting, allowing greater ownership of development policy, in safeguarding public safety nets, in protecting health outcomes (generally maternal and child health), and in providing for greater participation across political and geographic scales. At the same time, evidence suggests that participation in PRS process is varied and dependent upon existence of a strong civil society; although input may be sought from different sectors of society, decision-making is not jointly undertaken; the parameters of PRS are not flexible enough to manage external shocks such as the global economic contraction of the current debt crisis; continue to be heavily biased by donor preferences; and do not allow enough for context specific factors to alter policy prescriptions (Booth et al. 2006; Braathen 2006; Gottschalk 2005). The long term impact of this strategy remains to be seen. Whether the poverty reduction strategies represent a true shift in World Bank action as opposed to mere rhetoric remains subject to debate.",

It was during this latter period when the World Bank presented a cohesive health platform and rose to the fore of global health actors. This occurred when the bank revisited its previous work which, rather than furthering the mission of poverty alleviation was found to foster inequality and breed poverty (World Bank 2004). The new era of the World Bank thus saw economic efficiency continue as a concern, but such concern was married to an ideal of addressing inequity.",

Loans, grants and debt-restructuring would be available to those nation-states which adopted the practices put forward in the development report. The WHO could offer technical guidance but the World Bank could pay to make things happen. The practices recommended in the 1993 report included investing in human capital, encouraging government provision of primary health care and public health interventions such as vaccination, decentralization of health services, improvements in efficacy through (re)structuring of fees to incentivize appropriate care uptake and ensure cost recovery mechanisms, and promotion of competition for health care vis-\u00e0-vis opening insurance markets where appropriate. The most important elements of the health reforms espoused by the World Bank were provision of primary care, decentralization and privatization. The focus of these latter two programs was health system reform rather than improvements in population health, and hastened in an era of health commodification (Armada et al. 2001; Gomez-Dantes 2001).",

Decentralization would shift power away from the administrative center, typically in the urban capital, and disrupt problems which cronyism and patronage wrecked in terms of hiring, concentration of personnel, and flow of financial resources. These actions would allow health care to be better targeted towards the poor. At the same time, social service would be pared down to exclude subsidizing the non-poor and wealthy classes.",

The differences in technical capabilities at regional and local administrative levels were not provided for. As a result, decentralization efforts failed because highly skilled medical practitioners maintained an urban bias; municipal amenities and salaries were simply not enough to attract skilled practitioners (Oppong 2001; World Bank 2004). Further, the administrative capacity of municipal authorities was seldom up to par and training/capacity building were not addressed. In some cases, poor management persisted and, even with additional revenues from decentralization, the local authorities still could not pay for the services needed by the local populace (World Bank 2004). In other cases, decentralization actually increased cost of service delivery (World Bank 2004). In El Salvador, for instance, despite overall increases in public funding of health care, the funds which were allocated to the rural sectors decreased in part because the government, following a model of increased competition, contracted with NGOs to provide health care (Smith-Nonini 2000). In African, Latin American and Asian nations, decreases in public spending and resultant low levels of salaries for health care professionals created a \u2018 brain drain\u2019 with medical staff either concentrating in urban areas or relocating to other countries which offered higher wages (Oppong 2001; World Bank 2004). In addition, some nations continued to suffer from trade imbalances which caused the import of essential drugs to slow or stop (Oppong 2001). The decentralized health authorities were often left without necessary drugs or medical supplies.",

These mechanisms included the introduction of user fees on a sliding scale and self-funding for insurance. Evidence shows that the cost sharing mechanism essentially excluded the poor from accessing health care (Farmer and Bertrand 2000; Oppong 2001; Shaw and Ainsworth 1995; World Bank 2004). Increased user fees were shown to decrease health care utilization by the poor, to delay health seeking behavior such that treatment costs escalated and health impacts worsened because the disease progressed to a more severe state; people turned to traditional healers, informal consultants, non-Western medicine and/or self treated because of lower costs (Farmer and Bertrand 2000; Oppong 2001; Shaw and Ainsworth 1995; World Bank 2004). Privately-funded insurance programs prove unviable for the extremely poor, those with irregular salaries, and are of limited success in rural areas. Even in markets where payment did not present an obstacle, lack of information and coordination between public and private insurance can confuse the consumers, lead to underutilization of insurance, and result in cost and performance inefficiencies in the insurance market. Further, both decentralization and introduction of competition in financing and provision of health services necessitate having a strong, local civil society which can be social advocates. Where civil society is weak, many of the benefits continue to be captured by the elite (Ewig and Kay 2008; Gershman and Irwin 2000; Raczynski 2001). Insurance programs have met with moderate success in middle income areas; evidence from low income and highly indebted poor countries (HIPC) shows insurance programs tend to be weak because of insufficient numbers who can afford to pay into the system, inadequate risk pooling due, in part, to fragmentation across plans, and poor incentives for competitive insurance markets (Medici et al. 1997; Oppong 2001; Shaw and Ainsworth 1995; World Bank 2004).",

The balance between public and private responsibilities is highly contentious in the developed and the developing world. The health reforms to the UK\u2019s National Health Service which occurred under Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair speak to the constant struggle to find affordable, equitable mixtures of public-private finance and provision. During the writing of the first edition of this book, the United States was in the process of creating a major health care initiative to provide equitable access to health care through public and private means. The result was the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). During the revision, for the second edition of this book, the U.S. was debating whether or not to dismantle the PPACA.  Economists consider health care incentives to be among the most perverse in terms of using price points to signal certain behaviors. Given the struggles of high income countries to balance equity in care with consumer choice, satisfaction and free market principles, it is little wonder that low- and middle-income countries struggle with privatization.",

The combination of shrinking budget allocations for social services and the entry of private actors into health care resulted in a contraction of service provision (Armada et al. 2001; Oppong 2001). While ideally private competition would create more effective, competitively priced service delivery, such a theory was based upon a notion that all markets are equally attractive. This simply did not prove to be the case. For example, in some rural areas sparse population and the low income levels meant that economies of scale for health care delivery could never be realized, and that people would not be able to pay for medical care (World Bank 2004). These two factors alone would be enough to dissuade private health care providers from operating in the area. It would be difficult to get a single private enterprise to provide services, let alone allow for competition.3 With the lack of private entrants in the high cost, high risk areas, provision falls to the public sector. However, with constrained fiscal and human resources, and in some cases the loss of more profitable markets to the private sector, the public sector proved not capable of providing adequate levels or types of health services (Oppong 2001; Smith-Nonini 2000; World Bank 2004). The response to the noted failures of the first phase of health care reform was to address logistical problems with program implementation, and further evaluate context-specific barriers.",

Less resonant were the cost-recovery mechanism, privatization and health system reform. The WHO espoused the program of health system reform during the 1990s. Some see this as a failure of the WHO to maintain an interest in broad social determinants of health (Armada et al. 2001; Gomez-Dantes 2001). However, the action speaks to a degree of real politick which cannot be ignored. Developing nations and the WHO faced very real financial and operational constraints.

Health sector reforms have demonstrated some cost savings and efficiency gains in middle income countries (Medici et al. 1997). The impacts are more varied in low income nations or HIPCs. To the extent that program failures caused a re-evaluation of World Bank operations which now include explicit provisions to protect the vulnerable, and provisions for a participatory process, one can argue this, too, is a long-term success. The long term sustainability of the programs remains in question. However, the short term costs of the reforms are great. The contraction of social services under the SAPs created a health shock which had the greatest negative impact on the poorest members of society, those least able to mitigate risks of economic and health service contraction. As a result, short term health indicators for some groups worsened. For example, infant mortality rates in Peru decreased during the early 1990s period of economic restructuring. The occurrence of sickness increased more than 20% while medical purchases dropped by 50% in some sectors of society (Kim et al. 2000b). The contraction of the health care structure equated to a collapse of the monitoring, surveillance, prevention and treatment\u2014the keystones of public health. This collapse was associated with disease outbreaks, strengthening of the HIV epidemic, and increases in incidence and prevalence of endemic diseases (Kim et al. 2000b; Oppong 2001; World Bank 2004). The opportunity costs associated with the disease retrenchment are immeasurable. Further, the short-term impacts include increased inequity in both health and income (Armada et al. 2001; Medici et al. 1997; World Bank 2004). The human and fiscal costs associated with redressing this are incalculable. What remains unknown is whether the individual health and development situation of the countries which participated in the World Bank programs would be better or worse had there been no intervention at all.",

The end of the Cold War momentarily dispersed fears of a nuclear apocalypse.

The monies once spent maintaining the war machine could be redirected to social goods\u2026 the so-called . The integrity of the nation-state in the ideological stand-off was no longer of sole import because of increasing integration across economic, political, social and cultural spheres with heightened globalization and fluidity of the principle of sovereignty in defining and addressing global issues. At the same time, there was a shift in development thought and a new paradigm of sustainable , a process that incorporates social, economic and environmental spheres, became central in development rhetoric. The social aspect incorporates the capabilities approach developed by Amartya Sen, an approach that defines development as expanding people\u2019s choices, as well looking at social structures and processes that impact human well-being. This speaks to human development. Sustainable human development strives to ensure that future generations have the same opportunities as the current generation\u2014speaking to sustainability. This re-examination of development, peace-building and the role of multilateral institutions looked back to the original goals of the survivors the global warfare and rediscovered a raison d\u2019\u00eatre which focused on people rather than states. That reason was human security.The concept of security has for too long been interpreted narrowly: as security of territory from external aggression, or as protection of national interests in foreign policy or as global security from the threat of a nuclear holocaust. It has been related more to nation-states than to people. \u2026 Forgotten were the legitimate concerns of ordinary people who sought security in their daily lives. For many of them, security symbolized protection from the threat of disease, hunger, unemployment, crime, social conflict, political repression and environmental hazards. (UNDP 1994:22)\n",

State security is concerned with external threats to the borders, institutions, and governance of nation-states. It emphasized maintaining military defense, state territories and protecting national interests. But at its inception, the UN Charter promised freedom from fear and freedom from want; state security would provide freedom from fear but human security would speak to freedom from want. Human security spoke to security of individuals in their home, in their work, in living their lives. It spoke to the UN Charter\u2019s promise to harness economic and social progress as a means to foster human well-being and dignity from which peace would follow. The collapse of the Soviet Union illustrated one of the short-comings of the state security paradigm in that it had come to focus almost exclusively on external threats to the nation-state. But the Soviet Union did not fall in battle against a foreign military. It collapsed because of economic and social disorder. This reminded the international community that a broader interpretation of state security, one that included internal threats to national integrity, was a real concern. The 1994 Human Development Report reminded the global community of the promise initially laid forth by the UN and positioned human security as a valid, complimentary paradigm to that of state security. Governments were responsible for protecting their people as well as territory from the threats of conflict, repression, disease, hunger, and want. The main threats to human security include economic opportunities of households as well as states, security of food, health, environment, personal security from external forces and domestic forms of oppression, protection of community, political participation and democratic institutions.",

The IHR listed specific diseases which were to be monitored and reported vis-\u00e0-vis a global monitoring network, and set forth reporting and control protocol. Resurgent and newly emerging infections proved a challenge to the international community. Malaria re-emerged as both a regional and global threat. In fact, this single disease was found to limit economic growth in endemic countries by as much a 1.3% of GDP per year as compared to malaria-free nations (Gallup and Sachs 1998). The HIV/ AIDS pandemic touched nearly every country in the world. Cholera and plague resurged; and the world acknowledged that \u2018tropical diseases\u2019 like malaria presented a persistent threat. In 2002\u20132003, the emergence and rapid spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) showed that diseases spread quickly in the globalized landscape, and cost money and lives. The infection spread to 30 countries and caused 623 deaths worldwide (WHO 2003). Global economic costs are estimated to be as high as US$ 30 billion in Asia alone (Saywell et al. 2003). Among the nations which experienced greatest morbidity, mortality and/or economic losses were Singapore and Hong Kong, and Canada.

The world health community began the slow process of revising international instruments to better address disease threats in 1995. The result was a major revision of the IHR which was adopted in 2005. The number of internationally notifiable diseases expanded to include wild polio, novel strains of human influenza, and SARS. In addition, member states must notify WHO of any \u201c Public Health Emergency of International Concern\u201d (PHEIC) which includes biological, chemical, infectious, and radioactive threats. The health threat is to be reported regardless of the source of origin, a provision which allows for reporting zoonotic infections, or animal-based disease, which may pose a threat to the human population by leaping species. The IHR 2005 also created an extensive international network for disease surveillance and mechanisms for coordinated response to public health risks to minimize impact on international trade and traffic (WHO 2005b).

The positive incentives include access to technical expertise, assistance in mobilizing funding to comply with the enhanced monitoring and reporting protocol, and logistical support for outbreak verification and response. The threat of international disdain should a state fail to comply with the IHR creates a negative incentive to moderate behavior. The SARS outbreak serves as one such example. China reported the outbreak of a novel disease in February, 2003 stating that it had detected 305 cases of this new disease (WHO 2003). Subsequent investigation proved that China has obscured the facts (WHO 2003). The outbreak had actually been detected in November and the number of cases was more than double the initial figure (WHO 2003). The international community chastised China for failing to report a public health threat which did indeed create a global crisis (WHO 2003). Critics said that had China reported the initial outbreak, actions could have been taken to limit the geographic spread, health impact and economic damage. However, the economic and political costs of disease stigma, and being labeled as a source or impacted country, are high and create perverse incentives which can cause states to hide disease outbreaks.

In 2001, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organizations (FAO) found that a food security crisis was being exacerbated by HIV which was expected to kill an estimated 26% of the agricultural workforce in 10 African nations (FAO 2001). Those dependent upon the agricultural production would suffer too. If a single disease could take away 1.3% of economic growth potential in a year, the implication for economic distress from several health hazards across multiple years was staggering. The ultimate concern was that disruption in population health could not be isolated as it could cause a shift in the political, social, economic or military balance of power. International thought about health was changing. A critical mass of research and rhetoric had been reached. The international community could no longer address health as an isolated sector, nor as a domestic social issue. It was global, and it was important for peace, security and prosperity. In 2014, the UN Security Council and UN General Assembly again confronted a health threat to peace and security as Ebola raged through West African. The UN created its first ever health-focused mission as we will discuss in Chapter Five.",

The quantitative targets in the MDGs failed to account for baseline regional disparities and placed unfair expectations on those countries that were the worse off (UN System Task Team 2012b). For example, a country with a higher percentage of its population living in extreme poverty would have to have a much greater reduction in absolute number of people living in poverty to reach the 50% reduction goal than would a nation with a lower percentage of people living in poverty. The process by which the MDGs were created was criticized for a lack of participatory process and failure to utilize strong evidence in creating and monitoring progress (United Nations 2015; United Nations General Assembly 2013; Preparatory Committee 2011).

What were some of the (unforeseen) negative consequences?Do you believe the WHO approach to development through health vis-\u00e0-vis primary care, or the World Bank approach to health through development via structural adjustment and health sector reform will yield better results in terms of development and human well-being?
