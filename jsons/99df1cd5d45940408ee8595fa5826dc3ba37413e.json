Recent Findings Pneumonia can be prevented by decreasing the duration of mechanical ventilation using daily paired spontaneous awakening and breathing trials, but not with early tracheostomy placement. Other useful prevention strategies include semirecumbent positioning and oral care. Mini-BAL is a sensitive and specific means of securing the diagnosis of pneumonia that does not require a physician to be present and is therefore especially useful in busy trauma centers. Summary Pneumonia is a frequent complication among trauma patients. Risk factors are largely unmodifiable. However, trauma centers can institute routine daily paired spontaneous awakening and breathing trials to decrease the duration of ventilation and incidence of pneumonia. Future research is needed to further characterize the microbiology of pneumonia among trauma patients.",

Although it is well recognized that mechanical ventilation is the most important risk factor for the development of pneumonia, trauma patients appear to particularly susceptible.

While pneumonia can develop in any trauma patient after injury, patients injured in motor vehicle collisions are more likely to develop pneumonia than patients injured by other mechanisms [4] .",

Although traditionally requiring a combination of clinical (e.g., fever), radiographic (e.g., infiltrate on CXR), and laboratory criteria (e.g., leukocytosis), this has proven to be unreliable [1] . CXR has, at best, a 68% accuracy in the diagnosis of pneumonia [43] . For example, a false negative can occur from pneumonia that is simply not visible on plain X-ray and a false positive can result from alternate diagnoses such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, the need for quantitative culture has evolved. A number of different techniques can be used to obtain a specimen for culture from the respiratory tract. Tracheal aspirate, an outdated method of obtaining a specimen, has been abandoned due to low specificity as a result of tracheal colonization [1] . Contemporary techniques include bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and mini-BAL. These and other techniques are reviewed in detail elsewhere [1] . In brief, BAL involves sampling airway secretions directly using bronchoscopy. It is an invasive technique that samples approximately one million alveoli [1, 44] . BAL has been studied in trauma patients for the diagnosis of pneumonia, and one study demonstrated that BAL could reliably distinguish pneumonia from ARDS in these patients when the quantitative culture from BAL grew a pathogen at a concentration of at least 10 5 colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL [45] . Sensitivity and specificity of BAL have been reported to be between 70 and 100% [1] .",

This can be best accomplished by instituting daily paired spontaneous awakening and breathing trials in the ICU. Although there was initial interest in the use of early tracheostomy to decrease the duration of mechanical ventilation, this has not been supported by more recent, high-quality studies.
