On March 3, 2020, the virus has already affected more than 90,000 people in more than 60 countries, having killed thousands. Starting with January 20, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) monitored the situation and released daily reports about new cases of infections and death number in the Chinese regions and outside China. Following the general fear in China, the Shanghai stock market plunged 8% on February 3, 2020, and the shock rapidly spread over international financial markets. The United States (US) stock prices recorded their lower level in the last six months. However, a second, and more important shock hit the US market on February 28, when the S&P 500 plummeted 4.4%. Initially ignored, the COVID-19 effect raised serious concerns since the infection rapidly propagated outside China. The WHO report of February 28, 2020 underlined over one thousand new cases outside China and five new countries affected. The US financial markets reacted to this news, although Mr. Trump announced that a solution to this problem will be found \"soon\", by the scientists.",

Therefore, several questions emerge. How does this virus affect financial markets volatility? Will COVID-19 be the source of a new financial crisis? Without tempting to provide a straight answer to the second question, the purpose of this paper is to show how the coronavirus figures reported by WHO impact the financial markets volatility index (VIX). We consider a period of 40 days, starting with January 20, 2020, up to February 28, 2020. We look at three categories of data, namely new case announcements and death ratio (in China and outside China), as well at the number of daily affected countries.",

In a subsequent analysis we investigate the impact of COVID-19 death ratio on VIX ( Table 2 ). The death ratio has a positive and very significant impact on financial volatility and this result is very robust. Moreover, as expected, we notice that the death ratio associated with the virus propagation outside China determines a higher financial volatility, as compared to the ratio reported for China. In terms of elasticities, the na\u00efve specification (Model 2) evidences that an increase of 1% in the death ratio generates an increase of 11% in the financial volatility index. Compared to the previous set of estimations, where no significant effect is reported, the total death ratio (China and other affected countries) positively impacts the volatility. The last analysis tests the effect of the number of countries affected by the virus during the analyzed period, on the financial volatility. Table 3 shows a positive impact on VIX, confirming thus the previous results. The findings are robust to the use of US EPU as a control variable and show that the spread of coronavirus in general, and the increasing death ratio in particular, bust the financial volatility. ",
