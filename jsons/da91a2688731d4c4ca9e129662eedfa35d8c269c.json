Because of its small perihelion distance, Phaethon's surface reaches temperatures sufficient to destabilize hydrated materials. We conducted rotationally resolved spectroscopic observations of this asteroid, mostly covering the northern hemisphere and the equatorial region, beyond 2.5-\u00b5m to search for evidence of hydration on its surface. Here we show that the observed part of Phaethon does not exhibit the 3-\u00b5m hydrated mineral absorption (within 2\u03c3). These observations suggest that Phaethon's modern activity is not due to volatile sublimation or devolatilization of phyllosilicates on its surface. It is possible that the observed part of Phaethon was originally hydrated and has since lost volatiles from its surface via dehydration, supporting its connection to the Pallas family, or it was formed from anhydrous material.",

While originally suggested to be inactive, Phaethon develops a small dust tail for a few days after its perihelion 2, 3 . The origin of this dust tail could be due to the desiccation and thermal breakdown of the surface 2 or the last gasps of a comet-like sublimation-driven activity 4 . It is unlikely for water ice to survive and the dust to be ejected from Phaethon via gas drag from ice sublimation because this asteroid's small perihelion distance and high temperature make ice unstable on even very short timescales 3 . The Earth-crossing asteroid 2005 UD was found to be dynamically similar to Phaethon, and both asteroids are thought to be fragments generated by the breakup of a primitive precursor object 5 . Understanding the nature of Phaethon's activity would help us both age-date and better understand the nature of one of the most easily seen and massive meteor showers.",

Published values of the geometric albedo derived for Phaethon range from 0.08 to 0. 16 6, [8] [9] [10] . The rotational period of Phaethon is P~3.604 h (ref. 6 ). Bus and Binzel 11 classified this asteroid as a B-type according to the Small Main-Belt Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey (SMASS) taxonomy, though it is an F-type in the older taxonomy of Tholen 12 . Other B-type asteroids (e.g., (2) Pallas, (101955) Bennu) are composed of hydrated minerals, as evidenced by a strong absorption near 3 \u03bcm 13, 14 . However, Phaethon's surface can reach temperatures sufficient to destabilize hydrated materials because of its small perihelion distance. B-types are carbonaceous and primitive asteroids and many of them are located in the high-inclination Pallas family that includes the second-largest asteroid (2) Pallas 15 . Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)'s DESTINY+ (Demonstration and Experiment of Space Technology for INterplanetary voYage, Phaethon fLy-by and dUst Science) mission will conduct a high-speed fly-by of Phaethon in the mid-2020s 16 , possibly followed by a fly-by of NEA 2005 UD, which is likely a break-up body from Phaethon. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security, Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx)) mission has rendezvoused with the other B-type NEA (101955) Bennu 17 , which is spectrally similar to Phaethon in the visible and near-infrared spectral range (0.5-2.5 \u00b5m) 14, 18 . Bennu with a lower geometric albedo of 0.044 \u00b1 0.002 17 , was found to be hydrated 14 and recently revealed to be weakly active 19 .",

Kareta et al. 9 Fig. 2 Thermally corrected normalized LXD spectra of asteroid Phaethon. These spectra (a-j), which represent different sections of the asteroid, were found to be featureless at the 3-\u00b5m region, suggesting that the observed surface of this asteroid is not water-rich. The red dotted lines represent a continuum derived by setting the continuum reflectance at 2.45 \u00b5m to 1.0 and the slope to 0.00. The light gray bars (2.6-2.8 \u00b5m) mark wavelengths of strong absorption by water vapor in Earth's atmosphere. All spectra have been normalized to unity at 2.2 \u00b5m. Error bars were calculated using Spextool software and based on the Robust Weighted Mean algorithm with a clipping threshold of 8 (sigma).The value at each pixel is the weighted average of the good pixels and the uncertainty is given by the propagated variance. 6 showed that currently the equatorial region is facing the Sun during the perihelion passage, and thus is the most exposed region to the solar irradiation. However, due to dynamical effects, it was the southern hemisphere about 500 yr and 4 kyr ago that was facing the Sun during the perihelion. Finally, about 2 kyr ago, it was northern hemisphere's turn to be the most irradiated region. Clearly, the whole surface was exposed to similar environments during last few kyr. Asteroid Phaethon loses~10 5 kg per orbit assuming dust particles with an effective radius of~1 \u03bcm (ref. 3 ). While a small fraction of its total mass of~10 14 kg (ref. 22 ), this loss rate is more than enough to excavate some subsurface material, especially if the lost mass does not come from the whole surface uniformly. The fact that the observed portion of Phaethon's surface still looks as uniform as it does suggests that the current mass loss is possibly outpaced or matched by the processes (e.g., ballistic resurfacing) that serve to change and homogenize the surface, and thus that they act relatively quickly. If this interpretation is correct, one might expect that all sungrazing objects are essentially spectrally homogenized within a few orbits. Another reason that we might expect Phaethon to be more varied is the complex, cratered shape of the object seen in radar 7 . Perhaps the material excavated by those craters was similar to that of the surface materials, and thus Phaethon has been extensively heated throughout, or perhaps the topography we see is old compared to the recent heating of the surface layers.",

Masiero et al. 10 using NEOWISE observations found Phaethon to have a geometric albedo of 0.16 \u00b1 0.02, consistent with the geometric albedo of Pallas. Ali-Lagoa et al. 25 also showed that the albedo of the B-types in Pallas collisional family (p v0 .14) is higher than the average albedo of non-Pallas family Btypes (p v~0 .07). However, Pallas exhibits a sharp and deep 3-\u00b5m band (~20%), attributed to the presence of phyllosilicates on its surface 13 , unlike asteroid Phaethon (Fig. 3) . The peak surface temperature on Phaethon's surface is estimated to be above 1000 K 3,5 , which exceeds the dehydration temperatures for serpentines (antigorite, chrysotile, lizardite) that range from 900 to 1000 K (ref. 26) .

Rapid dehydration of the surface could have led to early activity, but given the anhydrous state of the surface indicated by the spectra presented herein, this mechanism is unlikely to drive Phaethon's current activity.

Hence, we had to remove the thermal excess using the methodology described in Rivkin et al. 33 and references therein. To constrain Phaethon's model thermal flux, we used the Near-Earth Asteroid Thermal Model (NEATM) 34 which is based on the Standard Thermal Model (STM) of Lebofsky 35 . The measured thermal excess was fitted with a model thermal excess. Then, this model was subtracted from the measured thermal flux relative spectrum of Phaethon. In the thermal model, we used a visible geometric albedo of p v = 0.122 \u00b1 0.008, derived by Hanu\u0161 et al. 6 , and a slope parameter of G = 0.06, derived by Ansdell et al. 36 for Phaethon. The beaming parameter (\u03b7) is used in the thermal model to adjust the surface temperature to match the measured thermal flux (e.g., Harris and Lagerros 37 ). We varied the values of the beaming parameters (from \u03b7 = 1.35 to 1.65) ( Table 1) until we got the best thermal model for each set while keeping the geometric albedo constant at 0.122. When doing thermal tail corrections, the choice of the albedo does not matter too much because in most cases beaming parameter and albedo are degenerate, such that different pairs give exactly the same thermal tail. Both bolometric and spectral emissivities were assumed to be 0.9. Since we used the Vband albedo in the thermal model, we applied a K to V scale for Phaethon (K/V0 .7) 23 to reconcile the two reflectance values at the two different wavelengths.",
