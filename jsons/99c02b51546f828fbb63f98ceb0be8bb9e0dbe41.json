No comprehensive surveys have been conducted to determine how many L. braccatus exist in the wild. It is found in humid, warm grasslands and wooded areas of extreme northwestern Argentina, southwestern and south-and north-central (newly reported ranges) Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Habitat loss and degradation are considered major threats throughout most of its range. It is uncommon in captivity and museum collections, listed with all Felidae under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, and considered \"Near Threatened\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources in the pampas cat group (= L. colocolo).",

They have been classified under various genera (e.g., Felis, Leopardus, Lynehailurus, and Oneifelis) and have been split into separate species (e.g., Garcia-Perea 1994; Wozencraft 2005) , often monotypically, or lumped with various combinations of subspecies (e.g., Sunquist 2002, 2009 ). Relatively recent molecular evidence (Cossios et al. 2007 (Cossios et al. , 2009 Johnson et al. 1996 Johnson et al. , 2006 Johnson and O'Brien 1997; Masuda et al. 1996; Mattern and McLennan 2000; O'Brien and Johnson 2007; O'Brien and Yuhki 1999; Pecon-Slattery and O'Brien 1998) suggests a phylogeny favoring various subspecific designations, in contrast to systematic conclusions based on just morphological characteristics that suggest unique species (Garcia-Perea 1994) . Using morphological characteristics, Garcia-Perea (1994) assessed the taxonomy of some South American small felids, formerly grouped under Felis eoloeolo, with 86 specimens from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay, consisting of 72 study skins and 51 skulls, from 8 North American, South American, and European collections. She grouped them under Lynehailurus into 3 species: braeeatus (with the 2 subspecies above; Fig. 1 ), pajeros (7 subspecies), and eoloeolo (2 subspecies).",

Two to 5 distinguishing characteristics of the skulls (e.g., bullar region, orbital region, palatal region, and neurocranium) and teeth were found among the various specimens of Leopardus, designated collectively as \"pampas cats\" (Garcia-Perea 1994). Small felids generally show a great deal of variation in coat patterns and colors. Considering all metrics, as well as geographic affinities, Garcia-Perea (1994) classified 3 \"types\" of pampas cats and concluded that colocolo should be split into 3 species (braccatus, colocolo, and pajeros) with which Wozencraft (2005) concurred. Sunquist and Sunquist (2009:146) formally considered braccatus to be 1 of 8 subspecies of L. colocolo, but they noted that \"braccatus and pajeros likely represent distinct species.\" Most recently, Nascimento (2010) , in his unpublished dissertation, identified 16 species of Leopardus based on 29 cranial measurements and 14additional morphological traits from 591 museum specimens; he elevated L. braccatus munoai to a full species. Conservation of South American small cats may be the most significant and pressing reason to consider their populations unique enough for special recognition and action ).",

Shape of the notch for the postpalatine vein in the palate is \"narrow and deep\" in L. braccatus and \"wide and comparatively shallow\" in L. colocolo and L. pajeros (Garcia-Perea 1994:11) . The frequency of the presence of P2 is higher in L. braccatus (630/0, n = 8) than in L. colocolo (330/0, n = 6) and L. pajeros (00/0, n = 21). Shape of the main cusp (paracone) of L. braccatus is \"short and wide in lateral aspect, lacking the sharp appearance\" seen in L. colocolo and L. pajeros (Garcia-Perea 1994:15) . The anterior cusp (parastyle) of P3 tends to be absent in all felids except big cats (Salles 1992); however, Gracia-Perea (1994)noted its presence in 3 specimens that she classified as L. braccatus and its absence in L. colocolo and L. pajeros. Lingual tubercles on c1 occur with the highest frequency in L. braccatus and at very low frequency in L. pajeros; they are absent in L. colocolo (Garcia-Perea 1994). Garcia-Perea (1994) describes all species in the \"pampas cat\" group, including Leopardus braccatus, as follows: face has 2 transverse brown to black lines that cross each cheek; superior line starts in the external comer of the eye; inferior line is almost parallel running up around the lateral side of the cheeks; and a 3rd line appears in some specimens at the dorsal end of the inferior line coming from under the chin and throat, creating a sharp angle where the 2 meet on the lateroposterior side of the cheeks. Underside of the chin is white; throat is the same color as the basic coat color, or is somewhat lighter orangish brown, and has 2 or 3 brown stripes that originate on 1 side of the neck and run under the throat to the other side. There are reports of melanistic \"pampas cats\" in captivity, but a camera-trap photo in Emas Park, Goias State, Brazil, seems to be the only known record in the wild (Silveira 2005) .",

            "text": "There are 2 types of pelage in L. braccatus. The 1st type is \"almost uniform brown agouti color dorsally\" with traces of \"dark brown rosettes on flanks\" and is characteristic of L. b. braccatus (Garcia-Perea 1994:19 ; http://www.catsg.org/ catsgportal/project-0-month/02_webarchive/grafics/sept2005. pdf, accessed 18 January 2012). The spinal crest of L. b. braccatus is a little darker than the basic pelage; tail is not ringed but has 2 or 3 lines that do not completely circumvent the tail above a black tip. There are at least 2 (but can be as many as 4) heavy black stripes that wrap around the front legs, and similar stripes on the hind legs, although those stripes may not completely meet on the anterior part of the leg. Spotted ventral markings of L. b. braccatus are black; throat is white, grading into orange behind the 1st throat stripe; feet are black dorsally and ventrally, including wrists and ankles, giving the distinctive appearance of wearing boots (Allen 1919b; Garcia-Perea 1994; Miller 1930; Pocock 1941) . The 2nd pelage type, typical of L. b. munoai, has a background color that is paler and more yellow to orangish on the back and flanks (Fig. 1 ). Brown spots on flanks are more noticeable than in L. b. braccatus, and the feet are black only on palmar and plantar surfaces. The tail of both subspecies is variously tipped in black. In contrast to L. b. braccatus, the black tip of L. b. munoai is reduced, and the tail, itself has only a few discontinuous rings (Garcia-Perea 1994) .",

            "text": "Ears of Leopardus are large and pointed rather than rounded as in other South American small felids (Silveira 1995) ; they are usually black on the anterior one-half and gray on the rest of the surface (Silveira 1995) ; and sometimes there is a pale spot toward the tip of the posterior surface of the ear. The hairs are longer on L. braccatus than on other South American species of Leopardus. Head-body length of Leopardus, in general, is 423-750 mm; tail length is 220-330 mm; and mass is 2.9-3.7 kg (Garcia-Perea 1994; Nowell and Jackson 1996; Redford and Eisenberg 1992; Silveria 1995; Sunquist and Sunquist 2002) . Redford and Eisenberg 1992; Sunquist and Sunquist 2009; Ximenez 1961) . Because of its extensive range, L. b. braccatus occurs in many more habitat types than L. b. munoai. A cat matching Garcia-Perea's (1994) description of L. b. braccatus was livetrapped in Minas Gerais, Brazil, except the feet were only black on the palmar and plantar surfaces instead of having the characteristic boot pattern. The Wild Cats of Brazil Project, or Projeto Gatos de Mato-Brasil (de Oliveira 2005 ; http:// www.wildcatconservation.org/Wild-Cats-of-Brazil.html.accessed 26 September 2011) also found camera-trap evidence of L. b.braccatus from Maranhao State of northern Brazil; Sanchez-Soto (2007) recorded a road-killed specimen in Mato Grosso do SuI, Brazil; and Chebez et al. (2008) documented its presence in Argentina-all greatly expanding the known range of this subspecies (Bagno et al. 2004; Chebez et al. 2008; de Oliveira 2006; Garcia-Perea 1994; Sanchez-Soto 2007; Silveira 2005) . Therefore, the approximate range of L. b. braccatus is between 2\u00b0S and 22\u00b0S and 45\u00b0W and 61\u00b0W (Fig. 2) . L. b. munoai occurs only in Uruguay and the state of Rio Grande do SuI, Brazil. Its primary habitat is savanna that occurs from sea level to 514 m above mean sea level (Bagno et al. 2004; Chebez et al. 2008; de Oliveira 2006; Garcia-Perea 1994) . A dorsal crest is distinctive of the pampas cat group, in which hairs are longer (7 em) than elsewhere on the body and flanks (1-3 cm-Allen 1919b; Nowell and Jackson 1996) .The crest is about 3 em wide and runs from the back of the neck to the base of the tail; it is reduced in some specimens of L. braccatus, making it rather inconspicuous (Courtenay 2002) . Both (nonmelanistic) pelage types have 3 or 4 dark brown, almost black, stripes that circumvent the legs, but they may be incomplete on the inner side of the back legs. The formation of the Panamanian land bridge permitted endemic small felids of North and Central America to disperse extensively into South America (Eizirik et al. 1998; Johnson et al. 1996; Johnson and O'Brien 1997; O'Brien and Yuhki 1999; Pecon-Slattery et al. 1994; Seidensticker and Lumpkin 2004; Wayne et al. 1989 ). The land bridge was completely established about 3 million years ago (Coates and Obando 1996) , but sea-level changes interrupted its formation several times until the mid-Pleistocene (Beu 2001) , suggesting that felid speciation also occurred in South America and recent diversity could be explained by a minimum of 5 or 6 immigrations (Prevosti 2006) .",

As parts of South America became more arid and seasonal, the shrub-grassland steppe initially appeared as a continuum of habitats that changed from dense forests to open expanses. Species no doubt adapted to these changes, but populations likely became isolated as preferred habitats became more disjunct. Some species, such as L. braeeatus, probably started to exploit newly developing shrublands and grasslands, which provided novel prey (Canepuccia et al. 2008; Hemmer 1979) .",

Areas in Argentina within the current range of L. braceatus have experienced an increase in annual precipitation of 10-300/0 over the last 50 years (Canepuccia et al. 2008 ). L. braeeatus may face greater threats in lowlying areas with increased precipitation, given that most native uplands have been converted to agriculture (as much as 800/0 of the Cerrado- Bagno et al. 2004 ) and are used for grazing. These effects can adversely impact populations, both directly and indirectly, by altering fitness and modifying availability of resources. Prey abundance may be reduced, and den sites may be lost to flooding. These interactions suggest that global climatic patterns could have significant negative impacts at regional and local population scales (Canepuccia et al. 2008) .",
