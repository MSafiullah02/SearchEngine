As of April 14, 2020, there are 1 933 800 confirmed cases globally in 210 countries and 120 434 deaths [1]. Health systems globally have struggled. Anaesthetists and theatre teams have been redeployed, and intensive care units (ICUs) struggle with demands as the entire service is refocused on managing the acutely unwell. Added to this are the effects of social confinement and isolation. Staff at risk are removed from the workforce for their own health and some of them get sick, also limiting capacity. This brings into question whether the latest guidelines based upon the best evidence and published only 2 wk ago are relevant in this crisis.",

We aim to do this by providing tools that can facilitate decision making. Our goal is to minimise the impact and risks for both patients and health professionals delivering urological care, whenever possible, although it is clear that it is not always possible to mitigate them entirely. It should be understood that there may not be high-quality evidence for the compromises proposed, but we hope that this document will function as an important additional guide to the management of urological conditions during the current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), based on the current European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines.",

In order to minimise the number of staff who become infected, all medical personnel should comply with the PPE regulations. If possible, patients should be asked whether they are at risk of COVID-19 prior to any visit in a practice or clinic or hospital setting. Patients who are currently known to be shedding COVID-19 virus should postpone any investigations of other symptoms unless they are thought to be life threatening. However, urologists working in hospitals treating COVID-19 patients may be required to perform urgent investigations on infected patients. In these cases, procedures should be performed in dedicated consultation or operating rooms following the hospital recommendation for staff PPE. Even following a negative COVID-19 test result, it is important to remember the relatively high risk of a false negative result and, as a consequence, ensure that all the necessary PPE tools and general recommendations to reduce COVID-19 transmission are adequately followed (Table 2) [3]. It is also prudent during this pandemic, in the absence of extensive community testing and effective isolation/quarantine strategies in place, that health professionals perform their duties on the presumption that all patients they treat are potentially infected with COVID-19 even if asymptomatic, given that there is increasing evidence of high infection rates in asymptomatic individuals in countries conducting extensive community testing of their citizens [4], [5]. In this regard, it is important to consider the risk not only for staff but also for the patients. Recent evidence from Wuhan reported a 20% mortality rate in asymptomatic patients who tested COVID positive after the surgical procedure [6]. Onset of symptoms was within 2.6 d, and 44.1% required ICU support. Out of 20 asymptomatic COVID-positive patients undergoing level 3 complexity procedures, which are equivalent to urological transabdominal or retroperitoneal interventions, seven died in ICU from acute respiratory distress syndrome (Table 2).",

They should be performed with the minimum number of staff members, who should also be fully trained and experienced. Furthermore, no external observers should be present during the procedure (ie, fellows or students) [7]. Use of ultrasonic scalpels or electrical equipment producing surgical smoke should be discouraged because such smokes could carry the COVID-19 [8]. In previous studies, activated Corynebacterium, papillomavirus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have been detected in surgical smoke, and several doctors contracted a rare papilloma virus suspected to be connected to surgical smoke exposure. There is no reason to suppose that COVID-19 infection could not be spread in the same way. One study found that after using electrical or ultrasonic equipment for 10 min, the particle concentration of the smoke in laparoscopic surgery was significantly higher than that in traditional open surgery [8]. Thus, it is recommended to lower electrocautery power settings as much as possible. There is no conclusive evidence regarding the differences in risks of open versus laparoscopic surgery for the surgical team. However, laparoscopic surgery may be associated with a higher amount of smoke particles than open surgery [9]. On the contrary, minimally invasive surgery has the benefit of reducing the length of hospital stay and reducing the risks to the patient for contracting COVID-19 whilst in hospital. During laparoscopy, surgical smoke is released into theatre under pressure at several stages of surgery. It is advisable to keep intraperitoneal pressure as low as possible and to aspirate the inflated CO2 as much as possible before removing the trocars (Table 2) [7], [8], [9].",

However, although no evidence of disease transmission through urine is demonstrated yet, urine sampling (for urine culture, dipsticks, and other analyses), urethral catheterisation, and endoscopic procedures (eg, transurethral resection of the prostate, transurethral resection of the bladder, ureteral stenting, etc.) should be executed with caution. As spills are inevitable, surfaces should be cleaned rapidly by using appropriate absorbent and by decontamination with chlorine (5000\u201310 000 mg/l) or another appropriate disinfectant (note that chlorhexidine is ineffective against COVID-19 and is not appropriate) [12].

This extended family ethos is even more important at a time like this when we are acutely aware of the despair that nations and their citizens are experiencing around the world. For instance, we realise that our colleagues and friends in Italy, Spain, France, UK, other EU member states and increasingly in the USA are being particularly impacted, whilst on the other side of the world, our friends in China, South Korea, and Japan look to rebuild and return to some form of new normality. Our thoughts are with each and every one of you. Despite these incredibly difficult times, key opinion leaders across the breadth of our membership have come together like never before to rapidly produce this publication on adapting EAU guideline recommendations to COVID-19 that we hope will fill an important urological practice void and assist urologist surgeons across the globe as they do their very best to deal with the crisis of our generation.",
