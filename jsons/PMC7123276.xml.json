There have been regional mass societies across the planet for millennia, with decisions made by regional elites far from the masses. Formerly, the elites were rulers of such empires as Persia and Rome, which sought regional domains of the world that their armies could control and occupy (Bozeman 1994). City-states tried to avoid being incorporated into empires but ultimately were drawn into imperial domains. After Spain sought gold in far-off lands, financing the voyages of Christopher Columbus from 1492 to 1502, his Viceroy of the Indies title signaled the beginning the Spanish empire. England, France, Holland, and Portugal soon sought to pepper the world with imperial conquests. In 1494, Lisbon increased the volume of global trade astronomically as slaves began to be extracted from Africa and sold to imperial powers to provide labor in the New World.",

The result was to divide the globe into state members in Europe and nonstates outside Europe awaiting recognition from Europe. The most prominent states involved in negotiations were the Dutch Republic, France, Holy Roman Empire, Holy See, Sweden, Switzerland, and Venice. Most of those outside Europe that were not recognized became colonies, subject to the \u201cright of conquest\u201d (cf. Brenner 2016).

All three Hague conferences were attended by government representatives as well as TAN epistemic communities, which had the expertise to formulate the texts of the resulting conference agreements.

(2) The Fair Trade System (MacDonald 2011), noted in more detail below, is one of twenty-three cooperative groups that issue voluntary regulations. (3) The World Commission on Dams, which existed from 1997 to 2001 to develop a set of standards for scientifically engineered dam construction in order to pass environmental and sociopolitical impact tests (Dobesh 2011), is one of several multistakeholder initiatives by expert groups from seventy organizations; although half of the directors were from Latin America, neither China nor, India cooperated (Dingwerth 2008: 612, 621). (4) The most famous private commercial arbitration body, the International Chamber of Commerce, has been operating since the 1920s (Lehmkuhl 2011). (5) Among four financing mechanisms in the volume, Unitaid is a drug purchasing organization funded by an agreement between Chile, France, and several African countries to impose a tax on air travel that is funneled to assist victims of HIV/AIDS (Holzcheiter 2011). Unitaid is one project of the Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions for the Aid of Citizens (ATTAC) (Evans 2005). Many private global networks listen to the demands of TNCs, if run by experts, but some voluntary regulations only exist because ordinary citizens follow them.",

The next major multistate conclave was the Congress of Vienna in 1814 and 1815, when leaders of the four countries successfully defeating Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte (Austria, Britain, Prussia and Russia) met with the post-Napoleonic French leader to agree to suppress nationalist efforts to break away from empires within Europe. Calling themselves the Concert of Europe, they also redrew the map of Europe by shifting territories around, declared that unilateral violation of a treaty was the equivalent of a war crime, opposed slavery, and recognized the rights of Polish minorities in Austria, Prussia, and Russia (rather than an independent Poland within those territories). But democratic developments in Britain and France ultimately ended that era of elite global governance by 1823 (Mitzen 2013).",

In 989, six French bishops at the Synod of Charroux declared the Peace of God (Pax Dei), advancing the law of warfare to prescribe immunity for children, clergy, merchants, peasants, and women. In 1026, the Truce of God (Truenga Dei) banned war on Sundays; the doctrine was later expanded to cover all religious holidays, including periods of Lent and Fridays. The Second Lateran Council in 1129 issued Canon 29, banning the crossbow in war. The concept of just war was further developed by Thomas Aquinas in the thirteenth century.

President Donald Trump has abdicated the global leadership of the United States by denigrating IGOs and renouncing international agreements. The Islamic world is undergoing conflict between competing sectarian views that have been elevated to matters of national power. Internal conflicts plague Africa, some involving jihadist groups. Within Asia, conflict over North Korea has intensified, almost the point of a third world war. Only Latin America seems relatively free of international conflicts, though some domestic problems are associated with globalization.

The IOC\u2019s founder, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, selected members of the committee with the power to determine the host city, which games would be played, which countries could send athletes, and to set the standards that athletes had to meet. The first games were held in 1896.",

Big changes to the Charter came soon afterward: An ethics commission is now in place, officers with limited terms are now elected by representatives from Olympic Committees in each country (not governments), sessions are open to the public, and finances are published. Democracy, thus, arrived in at least one arena of international sports (Keane 2009: 703\u201305).

Although INGOs with a mass base, such as Human Rights Watch, operate autonomously (Berkovitch and Gordon 2008: 884 n.2), other INGOs are dependent on rich donors, who may contribute only on a project-by-project basis, following priorities encouraged by the governments in which the donors are located. In some cases, governments subcontract to domestic NGOs to perform tasks authorized by domestic legislation. Because NGOs and INGOs have to compete for contracts, the result is decreased solidarity (Powell and Friedkin 1987; Cooley and Ron 2002).

But nation-states often hide the onset of an epidemic (Sparrow 2016: 27) until spillover is detected in the First World. For example, the Zika virus infected slightly more than one thousand persons in late 2015 but was noticed by WHO only after a few persons in the United States contracted the disease. Meanwhile, cholera continues to affect 3 million and kills about 100,000 annually. WHO\u2019s emphasis in 2015 was on Zika, not cholera. Malaria affects and kills even more, but the organization continues to respond to elite member countries more than nonelite countries, frustrating the effort to build a global health regime (Waldman 2007).",

A similar goal, asking European countries to grant independence, was responsible for the formation of the League of Arab States in 1944. Most African countries were colonies until the 1960s, and they formed the Organization of African Union (now the African Union) not only to hasten independence for the continent but also to pressure South Africa to end apartheid. Although six European countries tried to coordinate their efforts with the Pacific islands by forming the South Pacific Commission in 1947, colonialism did not fade in the region until the 1970s. A rival body of five independent countries formed the South Pacific Forum in 1971 (now the Pacific Forum) along with Australia and New Zealand, not only to secure independence for the rest of the South Pacific but also to obtain the wherewithal to become economically independent.",

When the organization officially began in 1951, five non-Asian members and three Indochinese colonies joined the three from South Asia (Haas 1989a). The Colombo Plan never obtained the necessary capital to flourish, however, and no pan-Asian organization has ever emerged. Instead, exasperation over American intervention in Vietnam united countries to form the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 1965, not only to form a bloc in UN forums but also to gain resources for joint economic development. Eventually, ASEAN formed cooperative arrangements with East Asian and European countries while providing a model for the establishment of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation in 1985 (Dash 2008).",

Relevant IGOs range from the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to the Human Rights Committee (one of eight treaty-based organizations sponsored by the UN) and the International Criminal Court (Haas 2014b: chs. 9\u201310). Human rights INGOs, such as Amnesty International, seek to promote compliance so that the global masses will benefit from protection of their rights. Both IGOs and particularly INGOs seek to shame violators with the aid of media coverage (cf. Murdie and Davis 2012; Peksen, Peterson, Drury 2014), resulting in a decline in investment and a lessening of repression within the countries that have been shamed (Franklin 2008; Barry, Clay, Flynn 2013).",
