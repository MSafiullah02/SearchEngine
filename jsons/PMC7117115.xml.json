            "text": "The intestinal epithelium provides a robust barrier that regulates absorption of nutrients and water and also restricts uptake of luminal bacteria (Su et al., 2011). The integrity of the intestinal epithelium is maintained by tight junctions (TJs), adherens junctions (AJs), desmosomes, and gap junctions. The TJ is the major paracellular barrier and functions to separate apical and basolateral compartments or membranes. The AJ forms a continuous belt between cells and is crucial for the maintenance of intercellular adhesion (Hartsock and Nelson, 2008, Su et al., 2011). The TJ and AJ are regulated by transmembrane TJ (occludin and claudin) and AJ (E-Cadherin and catenins) proteins on the opposing cells\u2019 plasma membranes and interactions mediated by actin binding proteins such as the zonula occludin (ZO) family, which link the AJ complex to actin microfilaments (Hartsock and Nelson, 2008, Su et al., 2011).",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae, causes high mortality of suckling pigs and substantial economic losses (Saif et al., 2012). Epidemic PEDV strains are highly enteropathogenic and acutely infect villous epithelial cells of the entire small and large intestines, but the jejunum and ileum are the primary sites of infection (Jung and Saif, 2015, Jung et al., 2014). During the early stages of PEDV infection, necrosis and exfoliation of infected villous epithelial cells is pronounced, resulting in acute, severe villous atrophy. To what extent the integrity and function of the PEDV-infected villous epithelium is restored by intestinal stem cells located at crypt cell layers is currently unclear. The aim of the present study was to determine whether PEDV infection causes structurally altered TJ and AJ in the villous and crypt epithelium of the small and large intestine by immunofluorescence (IF) staining for in situ identification of the related proteins, ZO-1 and E-Cadherin for TJ and AJ, respectively.",

The SPF herd was seronegative for antibodies to PRRSV, PRCV, TGEV and porcine circovirus type 2. Twenty 9-day-old nursing piglets were randomly assigned to one of two groups: PEDV inoculated (n\n = 9) and Mock (n\n = 11). Each experimental group of pigs was housed in a separate room in a high-security isolation facility (biosafety level 2). Nursing pigs were inoculated orally [8.9 log10 GE (\u22482.9 log10 plaque forming units)/pig] (Jung et al., 2014) with 1 ml of PC21A or mock inoculated with MEM. Inoculated and negative control pigs (n\n = 3\u20134/group at each time-point) were euthanized for pathological examination at an acute-stage (PID 1), at a mid-stage (PID 3), and at a later-stage (PID 5) of infection. After PEDV inoculation, the pigs were monitored for clinical signs 2\u20133 times daily until necropsy. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Ohio State University approved all protocols related to the animal experiments and care in this study.",

Villous height and crypt depth were estimated by measuring at least 10 villi and crypts throughout the section. Mean ratios of jejunal villous height to crypt depth (VH:CD) were calculated as previously described (Jung et al., 2006). The formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were prepared and tested by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the detection of PEDV antigens, using monoclonal antibody 6C8-1 against the spike protein of PEDV strain DR13 (provided by Dr. Daesub Song, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Daejeon, Korea).

The anti-ZO-1 antibody was diluted 1:100 in PBST and incubated on the tissues at 4 \u00b0C overnight. The anti-E-Cadherin antibody was diluted 1:100 in PBST and incubated on the tissues at 4 \u00b0C overnight, and an anti-mouse antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor\u00ae488 (Invitrogen) was used as the detection antibody and incubated on the tissues at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. The stained tissues were examined by fluorescence microscopy. ZO-1- or E-Cadherin-positive scores were computed by estimating the number of IF-positive cells in the intestinal section per microscopic area, at \u00d7400 magnification based on the following criteria: 0, no positive cells; 1, 1\u201329% of ZO1- or E-Cadherin-positive villous or crypt epithelium showed staining; 2, 30\u201369% of ZO1- or E-Cadherin-positive villous or crypt epithelium showed staining; and 3, 70\u2013100% of ZO1- or E-Cadherin-positive villous or crypt epithelium showed staining. Because the entire intestinal villous and crypt epithelium of uninfected and PEDV-infected pigs (E-Cadherin-positive scores, all 3) were positive for E-Cadherin, and E-Cadherin-stained villous epithelium (but not crypt epithelium) showed evident disorganization, E-Cadherin-stained tissues were additionally scored by the following system: 0, no positive cells; 1, 1\u201329% of E-Cadherin-positive villous epithelium showed disorganization; 2, 30\u201369% of E-Cadherin-positive villous epithelium showed disorganization; and 3, 70\u2013100% of E-Cadherin-positive villous epithelium showed disorganization.

Similar to PEDV infection of intestinal epithelium, TJ and AJ disruption in pulmonary epithelium, which might contribute to the desquamation of the alveolar wall, was observed in lung biopsies from the Betacoronavirus SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-infected macaques and patients (Nicholls et al., 2003). A previous study suggested that alteration of TJ and AJ may create a breach in the epithelial barrier allowing SARS-CoV to reach the basal matrix and eventually the systemic circulation, i.e. viremia (Teoh et al., 2010). By similar mechanisms, after PEDV infection, viremia might be caused during acute infection stages, as reported previously (Jung et al., 2014). In this study, by qRT-PCR, all inoculated nursing pigs tested at PIDs 1\u20135 also had low to moderate viral RNA titers in serum, ranging from 5.6 to 8.6 log10 GE/ml. Another study showed that impaired TJ in intestinal epithelium of patients with human immunodeficiency virus likely contributes to intestinal barrier dysfunction, resulting in increased permeability and microbial translocation that cause severe, chronic diarrhea (Chung et al., 2014). The impaired TJ and AJ caused by PEDV might be associated with high co-infection rates of infected nursing piglets with other enteropathogens, such as Escherichia coli (Turgeon et al., 1980, Wang et al., 2013).",

Whether PEDV can alter TJ or AJ in vivo in the intestinal epithelium of PEDV-infected pigs was uncertain. Our study clearly demonstrated that at PIDs 1\u20135, PEDV-infected pigs exhibited mildly to extensively disorganized, irregular distribution and reduced expression of ZO-1 or E-Cadherin in villous, but not crypt epithelial cells of the jejunum and ileum, but not in the large intestine, when compared to the negative controls. Structural alterations of TJ and AJ were extensive in the small intestine of PEDV-infected pigs at PIDs 1\u20133, but then appeared to recover at PID 5, as evident by increased numbers of ZO-1-positive epithelial cells and markedly improved appearance of E-Cadherin-positive villous epithelium of the infected pigs. Structural destructions and disorganizations of TJ and AJ in the intestinal villous epithelium with PEDV infection might be reversibly recovered during the late stage of infection.",
