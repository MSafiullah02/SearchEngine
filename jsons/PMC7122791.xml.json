Despite their infamy, bat viruses are not well understood. Elucidation of viral transmission dynamics in bat hosts will be essential to preventing future cross\u2010species emergence by facilitating predictions of viral shedding pulses thought to underpin spillover (Amman et al., 2012) and by highlighting intervention opportunities in enzootic disease cycles.",

            "text": "Serology often represents the most readily attainable empirical information for wildlife diseases; methods have been developed to infer dynamics underlying patterns of age\u2010structured seroprevalence for immunizing infections and prevalence for persistent infections (Brook et al., 2017; Farrington, 1990; Grenfell & Anderson, 1985; Griffiths, 1974; Heisey, Joly, & Messier, 2006; Hens et al., 2010; Long et al., 2010; Muench, 1959; Pomeroy et al., 2015). Numerous studies have reported serological evidence of bat exposure to henipa\u2010 and filoviruses across the Old World (Epstein et al., 2008, 2013; Hayman et al., 2008, 2010; Iehl\u00e9 et al., 2007; Leroy et al., 2005; Ogawa et al., 2015; Peel et al., 2012; Plowright et al., 2008; Taniguchi et al., 1999; Yuan et al., 2012), though only a few have attempted to use mechanistic models to infer transmission dynamics from serological data for any bat virus (e.g. for rabies: Blackwood, Streicker, Altizer, & Rohani, 2013; for henipavirus: Peel et al., 2018). The paucity of attempts to model such data may be attributable to the idiosyncratic landscape of chiropteran antibody responses. Experimental challenge trials with various bat species have demonstrated seroconversion after inoculation with Hendra (Williamson et al., 1998) and Nipah (Middleton et al., 2007) henipaviruses and with Marburg (Amman et al., 2014; Paweska et al., 2012, 2015; Schuh, Amman, Jones, et al., 2017; Schuh, Amman, Sealy, et al., 2017), Ebola and Sudan filoviruses (Jones et al., 2015; Paweska et al., 2016), though many studies (e.g. Halpin et al., 2011) report idiosyncratic antibody dynamics of seroconversion without demonstrable viral replication. Only a few studies have followed immunized bats for longer time horizons: in Marburg\u2010immunized Rousettus aegyptiacus, antibody titres wane after inoculation and primary seroconversion, but subsequently re\u2010challenged seronegative bats nonetheless remain protected from reinfection and primed to remount rapid antibody responses (Paweska et al., 2015; Schuh, Amman, Jones, et al., 2017; Schuh, Amman, Sealy, et al., 2017). The underlying immunological mechanisms for these responses remain unclear, but at least two pteropodid species were recently shown to maintain a constitutively expressed interferon complex (Zhou et al., 2016), offering an innate, non\u2010antibody\u2010mediated pathway for viral control.",

            "text": "The island of Madagascar is home to three endemic Old World Fruit Bat species, Pteropus rufus, Eidolon dupreanum and Rousettus madagascariensis, with respective Asian (Almeida, Giannini, Simmons, & Helgen, 2014), African (Shi et al., 2014) and pan\u2010Indian Ocean (Goodman, Chan, Nowak, & Yoder, 2010) origins. All three species are widely consumed across the island as bushmeat (Golden, Bonds, Brashares, Rodolph Rasolofoniaina, & Kremen, 2014; Jenkins & Racey, 2008; Jenkins et al., 2011), offering abundant opportunities for zoonotic transmission. Previous work reports serological evidence of Hendra\u2010 and Nipah\u2010related henipavirus spp. in P. rufus and E. dupreanum bats, as well as Tioman spp. virus in R. madagascariensis (Iehl\u00e9 et al., 2007). To date, no filoviruses have been investigated in any Malagasy bat, although one early serosurvey of human communities in Madagascar highlights seropositivity to Ebola\u2010related filoviruses (but not Marburg) in several localities across the island (Mathiot, Fontenille, Georges, & Coulanges, 1989). Recent modelling work has classed Madagascar within the \u201czoonotic niche\u201d for both Ebola (Pigott et al., 2014) and Marburg virus disease (Pigott et al., 2015). These intriguing preliminary findings, combined with the extreme virulence and heavy public health cost of known bat\u2010to\u2010human henipa\u2010 and filovirus emergence events, motivated our study. We aimed to (a) document the extent of henipa\u2010 and filovirus spp. exposure among endemic Malagasy fruit bats, (b) explore patterns of seasonality in seroprevalence and serostatus in these populations and (c) compare mechanistic hypotheses for possible transmission dynamics underlying these data.",

Captured animals were measured, weighed, sexed, thumb\u2010tagged and categorized by broad age/reproductive class. Between 0.03 and 1 ml of blood (no more than 1% of the animal's body mass) was collected from the brachial vein of each captured bat, centrifuged and stored separately as serum and pelleted blood cell. A subset of adult bats (85 P. rufus and 90 E. dupreanum) were processed under anaesthesia using a halothane vaporizer (4% halothane in oxygen at 0.7 L/min), and a lower left premolar tooth was extracted from these individuals for ageing purposes. R. madagascariensis bats were deemed too small for tooth extraction and therefore not subject to anaesthesia or ageing.",

Because fruit bats birth in annual pulses (Peel et al., 2014), we obtained more precise estimates of age by assuming a standard birth date for captured bats of a given species and adding the duration of time between capture and birth date to the integer estimate of age via cementum annuli. We computed ages for pups <1 year in the same way. In Madagascar, births are staggered among the three species, with the largest, P. rufus, birthing first, followed by E. duprenaum and R. madagascariensis (Andrianaivoarivelo, 2015), though the latter were not aged in our study. Assuming respective birth dates of October 1 and November 1, we computed age to the nearest day for 142 P. rufus and 109 E. dupreanum.",

We considered variations on five discrete model structures: (a) MSIR, (b) MSRIR, (c) MSIRS, (d) MSIRN and (e) MSIRNR. In all cases, we modelled the \u201cM\u201d (maternally immune; Supporting Information Figure S7) and \u201cR\u201d (recovered) classes as seropositive. The (a) MSIR (maternally immune, susceptible, infectious, recovered) model represents a classic paradigm in the dynamics of transmission for many perfectly immunizing infections, offering a null hypothesis against which to compare other dynamical structures (Bjornstad, Finkenstadt, & Grenfell, 2002; Metcalf, Bj\u00f8rnstad, Grenfell, & Andreasen, 2009; Metcalf et al., 2012). The simplest extension, (b) MSRIR, allows bats to seroconvert directly into the R class without becoming demonstrably infectious, as has been shown in the experimental literature (Jones et al., 2015; Paweska et al., 2015). The (c) MSIRS model permits waning immunity and return of recovered individuals to susceptible status, offering one possible explanation for the intermittent pulses of bat viral excretion posited to underpin spillover events (Amman et al., 2012; Plowright et al., 2011, 2015, 2016). The (d) MSIRN model allows for antibody waning of seropositive bats from the R class into a seronegative but still immune class, \u201cN,\u201d which could represent either non\u2010antibody\u2010mediated immunity or sub\u2010seropositive antibody titres that still remain protective, again reflecting the experimental literature (Paweska et al., 2016; Schuh, Amman, Jones, et al., 2017; Schuh, Amman, Sealy, et al., 2017). The (e) MSIRNR model merely extends MSIRN to allow N\u2010class bats to return to seropositivity after re\u2010challenge and renewed contact with infectious individuals.",

In keeping with previously developed multi\u2010state matrix models for human diseases (Metcalf et al., 2011, 2012; Wesolowski et al., 2016), we modelled epidemic processes on a biweekly (14\u2010day) time\u2010scale, such that twenty\u2010six survival\u2013epidemic transitions were permitted across a given year. In all cases, we assumed homogenous mixing across age classes and a constant transmission coefficient (\u03b2) across the duration of the time series (though the force of infection, \u03bb, nonetheless cycled annually in conjunction with changes in the infectious population). We fixed the recovery rate from infection at one biweek\u22121, the average of rates approximated in the literature (Hayman, 2015; Paweska et al., 2012; Swanepoel et al., 1996) and optimized all other epidemic parameters, depending on the chosen model structure, by minimizing the negative log\u2010likelihood of data of a specific age and biweek, given the model's output at that same age and time. For all models, we fit rates for waning of maternally inherited antibodies (\u03c9) and transmission (\u03b2) held constant across age and time (Supporting Information Table S7). For MSIRS, MSIRN and MSIRNR models, we additionally fit a waning antibody rate for individuals exiting the R class (\u03c3); for MSRIR models, a rate of direct seroconversion from S to R (\u03c1); and for MSIRNR models, a rate of antibody boosting (\u03b3), by which bats returned to R from N. For MSIRN/R models, we explored variations in model structure under which N\u2010class dams produced either maternally immune (\u2010matAB) or susceptible young (\u2010matSus).

The documentation of bat antibodies cross\u2010reactive with Zaire ebolavirus (but not Marburg) antigen will interest the global public health community, as recent work classes Madagascar within the \u201czoonotic niche\u201d of both Ebola (Pigott et al., 2014; Schmidt et al., 2017) and Marburg (Pigott et al., 2015) filoviruses. Ironically, Madagascar's inclusion in these risk maps has been largely derived from the species distribution of Eidolon dupreanum (Han et al., 2016; Pigott et al., 2014), the one Malagasy fruit bat for which we found no filovirus seropositive samples. This finding is not hugely surprising if we consider the relative rarity of Ebola seropositivity in E. dupreanum's sister taxon, E. helvum (Olival & Hayman, 2014), which possesses a receptor\u2010level substitution that makes it refractory to Ebola infection (Ng et al., 2015).",

To date, no henipaviruses or filoviruses have been identified (via live virus or RNA) in Madagascar. Detection and characterization of these viruses, together with description of the specificity, avidity and neutralization capacity of their antibodies, thus represents a critical research priority.

            "text": "The greatest challenge to our dynamical inference is the possibility that seropositive samples do not signify true circulating virus within any of our three species. In laboratory trials, for example, R. aegyptiacus bats are known to seroconvert upon contact with inoculated individuals without ever becoming detectably infectious (Jones et al., 2015; Paweska et al., 2015). While we attempted to explore these dynamics within a single bat population using our MSRIR model, it is possible that focal viruses circulate in species distinct from those studied here, resulting in seropositive samples via dead\u2010end seroconversion from transient bat contact with an alternative reservoir. Although we cannot falsify this hypothesis, there are a few specifics of the Madagascar ecosystem that make such a scenario unlikely. In particular, all but one of the roosts surveyed in this study are largely single\u2010species conglomerations: P. rufus is a tree\u2010dwelling pteropodid which only roosts in single\u2010species assemblages, while E. dupreanum predominantly inhabits cracks and crevasses with conspecifics (Goodman, 2011). In cave environments, E. dupreanum and R. madagascariensis occasionally co\u2010roost and roost with insectivorous bats (Cardiff, Ratrimomanarivo, Rembert, & Goodman, 2009), and all three fruit bat species contact at feeding sites. Nonetheless, given the relative rarity of these cross\u2010species contacts, it is unlikely that the high seroprevalence recovered in our data for anti\u2010NiV\u2010G antibodies in E. dupreanum (24.2%) and anti\u2010EBOV\u2010Gp antibodies in P. rufus (10.2%) result from dead\u2010end seroconversion alone. Previous work has investigated paramyxovirus spp. by PCR among insectivorous bats in Madagascar (Wilkinson et al., 2012, 2014), and no henipavirus spp. have been identified, further supporting our assumptions that Malagasy fruit bats maintain their own endemic viral transmission cycles.",

An analysis like ours would consider serological evidence of any ebolavirus infection equivalently and model all seropositives as one population, though, in reality, each specimen could represent a distinct virus that maintains its own transmission cycle. Again, we cannot falsify this hypothesis, but recent molecular work supports a theory of single\u2010bat, single\u2010filovirus species interactions that runs counter to this claim (Ng et al., 2015). We observed vast differences in the range of MFI titres recovered for each antigen among our three bat species, recovering high MFI titres for EBOV\u2010Gp in R. madagascariensis but only mid\u2010range titres in P. rufus (Table 1). We also found that E. dupreanum serum reacted most strongly to the NiV\u2010G antigen, while P. rufus and R. madagascariensis serum bound more tightly to the HeV\u2010F antigen. Such differences could be attributable to cross\u2010species variation in the robustness of the humoral immune response or could indicate that our tested antigens more closely align with the wild antigen from which one species' antibodies were derived vs. that of another. This species\u2010specific variation in antibody binding to the same antigen challenge supports our decision to model each bat species\u2013virus relationship independently, rather than allowing for significant inter\u2010species transmission to govern viral dynamics in this system.",

This pattern suggests that viral control is one of many costs to which resource\u2010limited hosts must allocate energy and that male and female bats do so differently while facing distinct metabolic demands. While higher serotitres in reproductive females may seem counterintuitive if viewed as increased investment in immunity, recent research suggests that bats may control viral infections primarily via innate immune pathways (Zhou et al., 2016), which are more metabolically costly than adaptive immunity (Raberg et al., 2002). It is possible then that female bats trade off innate immunity with less metabolically demanding means of viral control (i.e. antibodies) during reproductive periods (Brook & Dobson, 2015) or that contact rates with infectious individuals are elevated during these seasons, resulting in antibody\u2010boosting effects (e.g. Paweska et al., 2015; Schuh, Amman, Jones, et al., 2017; Schuh, Amman, Sealy, et al., 2017). Alternatively, elevated antibody titres might be independent of both exposure and metabolic trade\u2010offs; for example, production of the milk protein prolactin (typically elevated in late pregnancy and early lactation for mammals) is known to stimulate antibody production and facilitate maternal antibody transfer to young (Spangelo, Hall, Ross, & Goldstein, 1987).",

Previous work highlights notable seasonality in spillover of both Hendra (Plowright et al., 2015) and Ebola viruses (Schmidt et al., 2017), although the mechanistic contributions of bat demography versus physiology remain unclear. In our models, the force of infection varied seasonally as a result of birth pulse\u2010mediated cycles in the infectious population (Supporting Information Figure S13). Seasonal fluctuations in the magnitude of transmission\u2014which could emerge from changes in host contact rates (Ferrari et al., 2008; Grenfell, Bjornstad, & Finkenstadt, 2002), variation in within\u2010host immunological susceptibility (Dowell, 2001) or periodicity in viral shedding (Plowright et al., 2015)\u2014might further modulate seasonality in FOI. Several studies have highlighted the possible role that latent infections and viral recrudescence could play in bat virus transmission (Plowright et al., 2016; Rahman et al., 2011), but data from longitudinally resampled individuals were too few to allow for evaluation of any such model in our study. If future field work is able to demonstrate a role for seasonal transmission independent of demography, then the extent to which observed seasonality in serotitre could serve as a biomarker for an individual bat's infectiousness or susceptibility will be critical to resolving predictive power from cross\u2010sectional serological data.",

In our system, we can eliminate the hypothesis by which simple SIR dynamics incorporating a seasonal birth pulse might drive seasonality in viral shedding (Plowright et al., 2016); such a model yields a pattern of monotonically increasing seroprevalence with age at odds with our data. In our analysis, the MSIRN model consistently outperformed all other tested models in fits to the data, when constructed such that N\u2010class dams produced M\u2010class offspring. We hypothesize that N\u2010class serotitres could be dynamic: N\u2010class females may exhibit seasonally elevated seropositive titres during reproduction (consistent with findings from Aim 2), then subsequently reduce titres to seronegative levels post\u2010gestation.",

More extensive sampling will be needed to parse whether the seroprevalence decline witnessed in our dataset holds. Recent modelling of age\u2013seroprevalence trends for NiV\u2010G in E. helvum suggests that in the African system at least, seroprevalence plateaus at older ages, consistent with MSIRS dynamics (Peel et al., 2018), though it is possible that late\u2010age susceptibles in this system were captured during low titre periods in seasonally dynamic N\u2010class individuals. With our present data, we are unable to adequately distinguish between MSIRS and MSIRN hypotheses\u2014and unable to assess the plausibility of an MSILI hypothesis\u2014but both the experimental literature and our findings under Aim 2 suggest that the dynamics of humoral immunity post\u2010initial seroconversion are likely more complex than a complete return to the susceptible class would assume. Field and laboratory studies tracking viral pathogenesis in individual bats are greatly needed to enable construction of accurate within\u2010host models and to reduce our reliance on difficult\u2010to\u2010obtain wildlife age data (Borremans, Hens, Beutels, Leirs, & Reijniers, 2016; Pepin et al., 2017). More nuanced within\u2010host models might, for example, incorporate multiple classes for seropositive bats, differentiated by MFI value: R\u2010class individuals could have extremely high MFIs, while N\u2010class individuals might have titres at some intermediate level. At present, there is a trade\u2010off in selecting an MFI cut\u2010off conservative enough to limit potential for false positives and lenient enough not to miss true seropositives with dynamic titres. If, in the future, chiropteran immunologists successfully develop assays capable of distinguishing N\u2010class bats (e.g. some marker of cell\u2010mediated immunity), construction of age\u2013N\u2010prevalence curves would be illuminating. We would expect MSIRN dynamics to yield patterns of monotonically increasing N\u2010prevalence with age, while MSIRS and MSIRNR assumptions would yield age\u2013N\u2010prevalence plateaus.",
