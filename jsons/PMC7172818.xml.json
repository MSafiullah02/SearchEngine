These decisions must be made rapidly, often without a solid knowledge base. As of the first week of April 2020, strategies adopted by Canadian institutions varied considerably, with some significantly scaling down the number of FE and others maintaining the pace as before the pandemic. Here, we wish to bring forth preliminary results of the FREQUENCY study, a population-based retrospective cohort built to assess the performance of prenatal congenital heart disease (CHD) screening in Quebec.1 Although these results are preliminary,2 they show that scaling down the number of FE when the 2nd trimester ultrasound is normal can be done without a significant increased in undetected severe CHDs.",

We also present results for severe CHD requiring intervention < 1 month of life. The Table details the number needed to screen according to the FE indication. When the 2nd trimester ultrasound was normal, the number needed to screen was 222 for moderate to severe CHD, and 361 for severe CHD. We estimate that in the presence of a normal 2nd trimester ultrasound, not performing FE for maternal diabetes, family history of CHD, maternal medication, and increased nuchal translucency would reduce the number of FE by >40%. In our cohort, >95% of undetected moderate to severe CHD occurred in pregnancies without risk factors and were thus not referred for a FE. From the perspective of the overall population of Quebec, not performing a FE when the 2nd trimester ultrasound in normal would increase the overall number of undetected significant CHD by <0.8 per 10,000 pregnancies.",

The purpose of this letter is not to advocate for reducing the number of FE, but to provide evidence that, if it becomes temporarily necessary, it could be done rapidly for patients with a normal 2nd trimester scan without increasing the number of missed severe CHD. In a non-pandemic situation, balancing the pros and cons of fetal cardiology referrals is more complex. Such balancing should include CHD specific detection rates, both FE and obstetrical ultrasound sensitivities and specificities, regional variations in detection rates, and cost-benefit analysis, all of which will be addressed in the final analyses of our study.Table 1\n",
