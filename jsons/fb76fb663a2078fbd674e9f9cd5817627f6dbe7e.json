A delay would not have been understood and could have jeopardized the willingness of low-income countries to cooperate with high-income countries in the area of newly emerging and reemerging infectious diseases, such as SARS, or pandemics of different strains of the influenza virus. It might also have affected their willingness to collaborate with the WHO and its Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, established in 2000. The challenge for Governments and particularly for Ministries of Health in SSA, is how to address the two burdens of disease in tandem.

At the same time the leading causes of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in SSA have changed little over the past 20 years. There is, however, evidence for progress made in SSA in the reductions in mortality from malaria, HIV/AIDS, and in maternal conditions. 2. Remarkable declines in health loss from diarrheal diseases, lower respiratory infections, and measles have been achieved. Despite this progress, many of these conditions still top many countries' health burdens and account for a large portion of childhood death and illness. Malaria and HIV/AIDS continue to drive substantial health loss throughout the region, and do so at rates higher than those two decades earlier; it appears, however, that the total health burdens caused by these diseases peaked between 2000 and 2005 for most countries. 3. While most countries in SSA still face large health burdens due to communicable, neonatal, maternal, and nutritional conditions, many have also experienced an increasing disease burden due to injuries and non-communicable diseases from 1990 to 2010. These dual burdens of communicable and non-communicable diseases are largely found among the lower-and upper-middle-income countries, but even low-income countries are now seeing ailments such as stroke among their top 10 drivers of premature death and disability. Road injuries have become an increasingly dominant cause of health loss in the region, with many countries, including Ghana, Kenya, and Nigeria, documenting at least twice the health burden caused by road injuries in 2010 than in 1990. 4. War and conflict affected many countries in SSA in 1990, accounting for a substantial amount of health loss in countries such as Ethiopia and Liberia; by 2010, these causes were no longer primary drivers of premature death and disability. 5. Overall, a number of risk factors, including suboptimal breastfeeding, vitamin deficiencies, childhood underweight, and others associated with under-nutrition, have declined throughout SSA. This has likely contributed to the regional progress in reducing health loss caused by several childhood conditions. However, risk factors associated with growing burdens of chronic diseases, such as high body mass index and physical inactivity, have become important threats to public health in many countries in the region (Fig. 1 ).",

Furthermore the prevalence of NCDs and risk factors varies considerably between countries, urban/rural locations, and other sub-populations.

Efforts such as the WHO's NCD \"best buys\" (WHO 2011a) represent a good path forward. (2) For most infectious diseases, the time lapse between starting interventions and seeing improvements in mortality and morbidity is low -months or years; for most chronic diseases, it is high -years to decades. National leaders will need to define success, progress, and interim milestones in ways that ensure implementation and support through multiple political cycles. (3) Most infectious disease programs are administered by the public sector, with limited private sector involvement; much of chronic disease care in SSA is delivered and insured by the private and non-profit sectors.

This situation is changing, both as manufacturers from other countries such as India and China enter the market, and as the main Western manufacturers (e.g., Medtronic, GE, Siemens) recognize the need and opportunity for \"frugal innovation\", expand R&D activities in developing countries, and develop products which are not only considerably cheaper, but also technologically advanced and adapted for use in local settings (Economist 2011). -Medicines: many chronic conditions conditions (and indeed many infectious diseases) can today be managed well with relatively affordable generic medicines.

Investments in primary prevention pay back financially in decades, investments in secondary prevention in years. It is possible to develop lower-cost, high-quality delivery systems to meet this challenge, and indeed this is already happening in many countries, in particular India. The Naryana Cardiac Clinics for example, established in 2001, have become Asia's largest cardiac care center with hospitals and outpatient facilities in 17 cities in India. Their focus on high volumes, high throughput, and \"lean\" processes has allowed them to deliver more affordable cardiac surgery at a fraction of the cost in the West with outcomes that are global best practice: their mortality rate of 2% and hospital-acquired infection rate of 2.8% per 1000 intensive care unit days are comparable with the best hospitals in the world. This focus, along with a tiered pricing model, allows them to serve all income levels and not turn anyone away because of his or her inability to pay (see case study, Reform UK 2014) . Naturally economic sustainability can also be helped by focusing more on diseases that primarily affect working-age and income-earning populations (e.g., diabetes rather than dementia), but policy-makers must also address the issues of equity across generations and socioeconomic classes.",

The WHO (2014) estimates that 42% of all deaths in Ghana can be accounted to NCDs. In 2012 NCDs killed roughly 84,000 people. The leading cause for NCD death is cardiovascular diseases, which account for 18% of all death or 37,800 persons. However, contrary to widespread beliefs, not only older generations are affected. The probability of dying between the exact ages of 30 and 70 from any cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory diseases amounts to 20% (WHO 2014). The increase in the NCD burden is on the one hand related to the achievement of population ageing and on the other hand to modifiable risk factors of which many are linked to rapid urbanization and unhealthy lifestyles. Ghana's NCD burden is expected to further increase due to the continued development of the aforementioned factors. In August 2012 the Ministry of Health published the \"National Policy for the Prevention and Control of Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases in Ghana\". This policy defines the broad path which Ghana wants to follow in order to prevent and control NCDs. In line with the WHO, the country's NCD policy focuses on cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers, and chronic respiratory diseases (Ghana Ministry of Health 2012). These four NCDs share risk factors and therefore allow for a coordinated approach. To tackle these four NCDs the policy defines five strategic areas, namely: primary prevention, early detection and clinical care, strengthening of the health system, research and development, and the surveillance of NCDs and their respective risk factors.",

The latest report on the achievement of the MDGs concludes that the lives of an estimated three million children under age five were saved from malaria due to coordinated interventions in sub-Saharan Africa between 2000 and 2012. The report says that SSA is on its way to halting the spread of and reversing the incidence of tuberculosis. The incidence of new HIV cases in the region fell by more than half between 2001 and 2012. SSA has the second highest rate of access to treatment for HIV/AIDS, with 63 per cent of people living with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy in 2012.

This approach could go against the interests of whole business sectors.
