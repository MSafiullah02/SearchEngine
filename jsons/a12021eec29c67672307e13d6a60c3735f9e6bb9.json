Alternatives to colostrum are then required. The role of colostrum in energy provision can be efficiently ensured by milk replacers; however, the most critical aspect is to find colostrum substitution for efficient passive immune transfer to the newborns. (Hurley & Theil, 2011) . The role of milk antibodies is supported by observations of puppies naturally exposed to canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV2): despite non-protective serum CPV2-specific antibody titres (hemagglutination inhibition titre <1:80) at 2 days of age, none of thirteen puppies got infected before 6 weeks of life . Those results suggest that not only the global, but also local immunity provided by milk plays a role in the protection of newborn dogs.

Feeding of neonates with frozen/thawed colostrum could also be performed in breeding kennels. The colostrum collected from bitches living in the same kennel is the optimal solution to replace maternal colostrum in newborn puppies. It brings not only antibodies directed against local pathogens, but also large amounts of energy. In order to collect colostrum of high immune quality, bitches should be milked after cleaning of the skin, by a gentle teat massage approximately 24 hr after whelping. This delay is a compromise between the acquisition of passive immunity by the litter of the donor bitch and the kinetics of colostrum IgG concentration. Indeed, colostrum IgG concentration decreases by more than 50% over the first 24 hr after parturition (3830 mg/dl at 4 hr after the expulsion of the first puppy versus 1730 mg/dl at 24 hr (Albaret, Mila, Grellet, & Chastant-Maillard, 2016) ). Subsequently, IgG concentration continues to decrease, reaching approximately 200 mg/dl as early as Day 7 and remaining low until the end of lactation (Sch\u00e4fer-Somi et al., 2005) . One-to five-ml samples should be stored in polypropylene or glass tubes and immediately frozen at \u221220\u00b0C. Before administration, frozen colostrum should be warmed up to 30-35\u00b0C, for example with a baby bottle warmer; microwaves should be avoided (due to immunoglobulin destruction).
