            "text": "The article addresses the risks posed by urban living, particularly how urbanisation presents risks of diseases manifesting at the animal\u2010human interface. The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) estimates that 75 per cent of infectious diseases in humans (e.g. including Ebola, HIV, and influenza) have an animal origin and, on average, there are five new human diseases that emerge every year and, of these, three are of animal origin (OIE, 2019). Managing zoonoses is one of the most pressing and complex challenges for modern risk governance given they have severe social, environmental, political and economic implications but the degree of success in managing such risks dependence heavily on political priorities and governance capacities (Connolly, 2017). These acute challenges have contributed to the emergence of the OH agenda, which has gained increasing traction in global health security since the turn of the millennium. OH recognises what has been known for many decades, which is that human and animal health is interdependent. Therefore, OH promotes \u2018the interrelationship between human, animal and environmental health, which requires multi\u2010stakeholder collaboration across many cultural, disciplinary, institutional and sectoral boundaries\u2019 (Hitziger et al., 2018, p. 211). The 2019\u20132020 coronavirus (Covid\u201019), which emerged from China, has served to further restate the need for global health security paradigms which focus on the risks of diseases at the animal\u2010human interface.\n1\n The suspicion by health authorities was that there was a link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting that the disease passed from animals to humans (US Centres for Disease Control, 2020). The coronavirus outbreaks serve to highlight that health security is not just about implementing crisis management measures for public health threats but it is also a question of developing planning and responses that are about addressing the \u2018causes of the causes\u2019 of infections.",

Avoiding piecemeal approaches addressing infectious diseases, and the transmissibility of diseases between animals and humans, requires long\u2010term investment and the breaking down of interdisciplinary silos (Leboeuf, 2011; Lee and Brumme, 2013). OH, however, is one of those concepts that could be accused of being an overly ambitious agenda for policy makers given that there is limited progress towards its consistent implementation across the globe. The OH approach is more than focusing on disease threats and the scientific considerations regarding epistemology but it is also adopt adopting a \u2018systems\u2019 perspective to health. This is based on the principle that health security needs to be a \u2018whole of society\u2019 approach, which takes into account of eco\u2010systems, socio\u2010economic conditions, and geo\u2010political conditions. Moreover, urbanisation and urban change have implications for the risks of infectious diseases emerging and spreading, which suggests that care and diligence should be applied when it comes to the nature and closeness of the relationship between humans and animals in urban settings. Interestingly, this cautionary note comes in the context of the fact that the social sciences point to the benefits of the complex connectivity between humans and animals (see Dhont et al., 2019).",

The article calls for more of a policy focus on developing capacities at meso\u2010 and micro\u2010levels of governance.

Jones et al. (2013, p. 8402) note that \u2018these play an important role in the emergence and re\u2010emergence of infectious diseases by affecting ecological systems at landscape and community levels, as well as host and pathogen population dynamics\u2019. Poor sanitation, overcrowding and poor infrastructure affect the epidemiology of emerging infectious diseases (Neiderud, 2015). Major examples of contemporary health security crises (such as SARS in 2013), the 2009 flu pandemic in the UK, and the 2014 Ebola crisis West Africa have originated in animal infections. Heymann and Dixon (2013) note that it was most likely that the SARS outbreak emerged from a civet (\u2018toddy cat\u2019) that was the carrier of the coronavirus in a live animal market in a province in South China (Heymann and Dixon, 2013). The 2009 pandemic influenza outbreak, also referred to as \u2018swine flu\u2019, also had animal health origins in that the virus was a new strain of H1N1 as a result of a combination of bird, swine and human flu viruses, which was further compounded with a Eurasian pig flu virus (Trifonov et al., 2009). Thorson and Ekdahl (2005) highlight how the 2005 H5N1 avian influenza outbreak, which spread worldwide in 2005, had public health implications but, according to the World Health Organisation, \u2018all cases of H5N1 infection in people have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1\u2010contaminated environments\u2019 (WHO, 2019a). Lowe et al (2018) also highlight how the 2015 Zika virus outbreak in Brazil was found to be transferred to humans via Aedes mosquitoes. The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa was most likely due, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2016), to human exposure to bat roost. Ebola is contracted from forest animals (including monkeys and bats) and the severe 2018\u201019 outbreaks of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo present a reminder of the deadly nature of this disease (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019a).",

A landmark moment towards the global acceptance of OH as a way of thinking was when the WHO, OIE, and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations worked with UNICEF and the World Bank to develop a joint strategic framework in response to emerging and evolving infectious diseases (Gibbs, 2014). A number of policy commitments on OH followed, including the setting up of research collaborations and OH projects in developing countries, as well as commitments by supranational institutions, such as the European Union to operate under an OH framework post\u20102010. In 2012, for example, the Council of the European Union called for Member States to work together to adopt a OH approach to addressing the risks of antimicrobial resistance by taking \u2018a holistic risk based approach\u2019 (Council of the EU, 2012). In many senses, the EU\u2019s stance mirrors much of the principles and proposals promoted via the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHRs), which is essentially an agreement between 196 countries to work together in the interests of global health security (WHO, 2005, 2019b). Through IHR, countries have agreed to build their capacities to detect, assess and report public health events. WHO plays the coordinating role in IHR and, together with its partners, helps countries to build capacities at a local and national level (WHO, 2005).",

From an international public policy perspective, such developments enhance the prospect of the emergence of an OH \u2018epistemic community\u2019 (Haas, 1992). The claim to expertise provides such networks with a potentially significant role in providing lessons for policy makers on how to address complex policy issues. The jury is still out on whether the OH movement can be defined as an epistemic community (see Connolly, 2017) and the evaluation of the effectiveness and the outcomes of OH initiatives, which take account of the multi\u2010factorial and systems\u2010based nature of interventions, is in its infancy and remains a matter for future research (R\u00fcegg et al., 2017).",

            "text": "Yet, not dissimilar to calls for addressing climate change and societal inequalities, OH has gained momentum within international policy language and there is general recognition by policy makers of its value but it is vulnerable to external political and economic change. For example, the opportunity costs for the European Union institutions resulting from Brexit has led to institutions, such as the European Medicines Agency, putting in place business plans to scale back international collaborative efforts on OH activities (EMA, 2018). An interview with the head of regulatory science at the EMA noted that, in practice, this predominantly refers to antimicrobial resistance, which is one of the most significant risk to global health security in modern times (interview with the author, 2018). In this respect, the politics of risk and crisis management has been as much of an enabler (e.g. the general acceptance of the principles of OH by international organisations) as a barrier to the implementation of OH (macro\u2010political turbulence and short\u2010termism). The politics of OH is similar to Hogwood and Gunn\u2019s (1984) arguments about the imperfection of policy implementation in the real world i.e. for \u2018perfect implementation\u2019 to occur enough time and resources are available, the right combination of resources are available and deployed, implementation is based on a valid theory of cause and effect, and there is perfect communication and coordination. Kock et al. (2018, p. 28) apply such thinking to OH in an effort highlight the barriers to its implementation:Efforts and progress towards OH are still restricted by the inertia of long established divisions, institutional and logistical barriers to sharing data and information across institutions (World Bank, 2018), and power and leadership struggles with failure to agree on task and resource allocation issues (Rushton et al., 2012). Besides a few studies on joint health service delivery (Schelling et al., 2005), brucellosis (Roth et al., 2003), rabies control and laboratory infrastructure (World Bank, 2018), there is a lack of economic evidence and metrics to measure OH gains (Hasler et al., 2014) \u2026 [OH] requires a shift from linear thinking and simplistic medicalisation of health, to systemic transdisciplinary approaches with contributions from a wide range of professionals such as ecologists, agriculturalists, engineers, architects and also social scientists, including political scientists, economists, anthropologists and behavioural scientists, as well as from the stakeholder community and its representatives (Zinsstag et al., 2015).\n",

Systems\u2010based thinking has a significant level of rational orientation in the sense that complex problems require complex processes to solve them. Adopting such thinking in social science raises a number of assumptions \u2013 not least that there are the resources, knowledge and political will for the adoption of a functionally collaborative approach. Even the idea of a systems\u2010based approach in the social sciences has been argued to be based on hope, with its advantages exaggerated (Cairney and Geyer, 2017). OH principles could be accused of naivety and avoiding the reality of the fact that each of the candidate disciplines that would be needed for joining up (such as environmental science, public health science, veterinary science, urban planning, for instance) each operate within their own dimensions of complexity \u2013 and can be part of different policy subsystems (McGee and Jones, 2019).",

            "text": "Subsystems perspectives give a sense of the constraints around integration and the \u2018joining\u2010up\u2019 of organisations and cultures. If, for instance, we consider the health risks of the urbanisation of animal dwellings then who would need to be joined up in order to mitigate risks that animal infections pose to public health? There would need to be a space in which collaboration can take place between environmental health, veterinarians, public health experts and urban planners. Yet matters of space are only important to the extent to which there is leadership of the space and the incentives in which to mobilise stakeholders to work together. The stakeholder that takes responsibility for leading within such contexts will then be accountable for the collaboration. The added complicating factor is that the muddy waters of complex governance systems open up opportunities for culpability avoidance and \u2018blame games\u2019 due to unclear boundaries of responsibility (Hood, 2002). That being said, political studies call upon critics of those who might consider the integration of organisations within complex network governance environments to be mindful of the change\u2010making roles of meso\u2010level leaders who can be effective in navigating through relationships across geographical areas, municipalities, and territories within states (Lipsky, 2010; Luke, 1998; Williams, 2012). For a transdisciplinary approach to be considered as a way to address risks at the animal\u2010human interface, there need to be \u2018co\u2010leadership\u2019 across boundaries (Hitziger et al., 2018). This is based on the idea that bringing sectors together and exchanging experiential learning leads to public and societal value in that it can help to build trust, strengthen networks for collaboration and even eliminate prejudice (Hitziger et al., 2018). Governance scholars also recognise the links between trust\u2010building, joined up approaches to addressing social problems, deliberative practices and \u2018public value\u2019 (Moore, 1995; Stoker, 2006). If we accept, therefore, that implementation remains a developing process which will take considerable commitment for it to be implemented consistently across the globe, there remain questions about how urbanisation plays its part in the increasing vulnerability for diseases to transcend the animal\u2010human interface.",

            "text": "The aforementioned example of bird flu demonstrates how individual decisions by people as part of urban living can make a major difference when it comes to the risks of diseases spreading. This might include how individuals interact with annual specifies, their buying and consumption behaviours, which is an aspect of the OH agenda that has less of a focus in the literature. Similar to contemporary debates about climate change, the focus needs to be more about incentivising and informing the public about the steps that they can take to minimise the risk of diseases taking hold within urban spaces. Kock et al.(2018) cites Houle (2015) when addressing the topic of individual public health and the OH concept. Houle questions the use of health concepts could themselves be \u2018unhealthy and maladaptive\u2019 and that they can lead to \u2018dependency and passivity\u2019. Taking ownership of health and reducing modifiable behavioural risks has been the thrust of tobacco and alcohol public health communication strategies for decades now as a way to prevent the onset of non\u2010communicable diseases (e.g. cancers, heart disease, diabetes). This degree of public health messaging should also be seen for communicable diseases. The shift in responsibilisation towards individuals does, however, require incentives and diplomacy. The Jakarta rat eradication programme is an example of how programmes, with incentives, can be used to address health risks caused by the urbanisation of rodents. Van Mead (2016) reported on the rat eradication programme for the Guardian newspaper and documented how, in 2015, there were 40 cases of Leptospirosis (a bacterial infection from rat urine that can be deadly to humans). Rats are also associated with toxoplasmosis, the plague and hantavirus infection. Van Mead noted that the risks of the disease are enhanced by the flooding in region and describes the influx of the rat population to urban spaces:While rodent populations are highest near markets and their ready supply of waste food, they can be seen almost anywhere in the city. Rats have been spotted in courthouses and government offices, exclusive apartment blocks and expensive restaurants. Wander the streets at 3am and rats can be seen scurrying in and out of drains. They don\u2019t seem too scared of people. The rats gnaw through plastic drainage pipes and electrical wires. It is both a fire hazard and an expensive problem to fix as a broken pipe or chewed through wire could be anywhere \u2013 outside, inside or under \u2013 that a rat can get.\n",

The intervention implemented by the authorities in Jakarta was to incentivise the public by offering 20,000 rupiahs (\u00a31.20 sterling) per live rat collected. This appears to be a strong incentive when seen in the context of the fact that the average monthly income in Jakarta is 255,463 rupiahs, which is approximately \u00a314 (sterling) (Winarso, 2011). A condition of the payment is that the rat is caught alive to ensure that they have not been poisoned or shot (which are also dangers to the public) and to avoid dishonest claims for dead rodents (Van Mead, 2016). What this indicated is that the OH principles need to include both structure and agency with focus given to the role of individuals living in urban spaces when it comes to minimising the risk of diseases taking hold as a result of the urbanisation of animal species.",

The German economist, Horst Siebert (2001), introduced the phrase the \u2018cobra effect\u2019 to describe the unintended consequences of incentivising people to address diseases in urban spaces. The cobra effect is a shorthand for articulating when an identified solution to a problem only makes the problem worse and exacerbates the original threats. One of the case studies that Siebert documents is the bounty introduced as part of rat eradication programme in Hanoi, Vietnam, when it was under colonial rule. The policy was that rewards would be given for each severed rat tail that was provided. Colonial officials then started to notice rats going about their business with no tails. In short, rat catchers came up with a scheme whereby they would cut off their tails and then release them into sewage systems for them to procreate as part of a business venture! There is no evidence to say this is what has occurred in Jakarta. The scale is much smaller in Jakarta to that compared to what historian Michael Vann (2003) described as \u2018the Great Hanoi Rat Massacre\u2019 but the lessons from history are important for the governance and monitoring of incentive\u2010based interventions. The Jakarta rat infestation case is a reminder that disease threats at the animal and human interface are a major, although not exclusive, risk caused by the dysfunctional co\u2010existence of humans and rodents in urban spaces (Meerburg et al., 2009). These are examples of local programmes but there are also questions with regards to the level of priority attached to the risks posed by urbanisation in a global context.

Health and urbanisation is a major theme that cross\u2010cuts many of the goals. The UN frame the 17 SDGs as an opportunity to continually integrate approaches and organisations under the principle of \u2018good governance\u2019. Despite the \u2018good\u2019 intentions the SDGs, there have been questions about their level of complexity, including the political and governance capacities for them to be realised (Liverman, 2018). The \u2018SDGs provide a key entry point for the OH approach to drive a paradigm shift in policy and practice towards a fully integrated approach\u2019 (Queenan et al., 2017, p. 6). However, Waage et al (2015) cited in Queenan et al. (2017, p. 5) \u2018criticises the SDGs for being developed within different sectors and presented by the UN without recognizing the interactions\u2019. Urbanization, and risks of urban animals producing health threats, risk being lost within the web of SDGs given that health and the environment\u2010related SDGs cover a broad range of areas. The SDGs that concern health in the context of urbanisation could also lead to unintended consequences. For example, the overarching SDG 3 (Ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all ages) does not have clear enough links with the ideas of city development contained in SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communities) and neither of the specific goals underpinning SDG 3 or 11 mention urbanisation in the context of health security, including how urban animals and wildlife adapt to urban development and what the associated health risks might be. Rather, the focus is more on wider environmental and infrastructural matters relating to aspects such as waste management, human settlement planning and transport (UN, 2019a). From a global health security governance perspective, this is very surprising given Ebola alone in West Africa claimed the lives of at least 12,000 people with multiple of tens of thousands of cases reported (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016). The only, but broad, ambition of SDG 3 that could relate to the disease\u2010induced risks of urban living at the animal\u2010human interface is that \u2018the capacity of all countries, in particular developing countries, for early warning, risk reduction and management of national and global health risks\u2019 should be strengthened (UN, 2019b).",

That is to say that meso\u2010level leadership at state level (or underneath) is needed to build capacity for the delivery and evaluation of the SDGs for urban and city in order to minimise conceptual stretching (Peters, 2013). More specifically, a meaningful way to enhance the OH agenda is to invest in UN\u2010led/funded, geographically focused, city planning programmes that draw together professional knowledge from the veterinary, public health and ecology disciplines. The focus of several of the SDGs concern environmental issues, and that is a useful backdrop, but there remains a governance gap between macro\u2010level thinking and what could be seen as more applied leadership at a systems level given that it is in this policy space where there are opportunities for \u2018catalytic leadership\u2019 (Luke, 1998). The 2005 WHO IHRs also promote a multi\u2010level view, and imperative, around ensuring there are capacities to plan, survey, and report on health security threats a local and national level. In this sense, the WHO recognised the importance of meso\u2010level leadership. What is less clear from the IHRs and, accordingly, the SDGs, are the possible strategies and leadership initiatives that can instil a OH interdisciplinary mind\u2010set before a crisis or threat manifests and what the WHO can do to unlock capacities in this respect \u2013 the focus has been on establishing public health emergency response plans by drawing in \u2018multi\u2010disciplinary/multi\u2010sectoral teams to respond to events\u2019 (see WHO, 2005, p. 41). Much can be learned from the recommendations put forward by Firth and Zuelke (2014) who, in their analysis of urbanisation and health, maintain that \u2018taking steps to improve urban disease surveillance, developing effective prevention measures and initiating appropriate education campaigns will allow us to significantly reduce the impact of emerging infectious diseases\u2019. Working across disciplines to implement local measures to minimise anthropogenic animal movements is another important preventive measure that should be part of planning and contingency strategies (see Kruse et al., 2004). In governance terms, this warrants the need for city leadership to form an important part in building OH strategic capacities. The thinking in relation to climate action and leadership, in terms of the emphasis on \u2018city networks\u2019, is a candidate for conceptual refraction with OH debates given the city network perspectives have transcended \u2018beyond municipal collaborations towards more complex networked governance arrangements\u2019 (Davidson et al., 2019). For such network arrangements to be effective, however, there needs to be trust been stakeholders, transparent disease reporting processes and generally \u2018good governance\u2019 \u2013 all of which were called into question with regards to the Chinese government\u2019s response to the 2020 coronavirus (Kynge et al., 2020).",

Analysis showed that a single dairy goat farm was the source of the outbreak. There was an effective range of the airborne Coxiella burnetii for people living within 5 kilometres of the farm, affecting an area that become increasingly densely populated by humans and dairy farms over the previous decade. In an interview with the author, the Head of the Veterinary Medicines Division of the European Medicines Agency, Dr Ivo Claassen, who is also from the Netherlands, reflected on the lessons regarding the weaknesses of preparedness for the outbreak of Q fever, suggested that an OH approach, particularly ensuring knowledge integration between human and veterinary medicine experts, would certainly not have had severe or adverse implications for the crisis management response:From my own experience I would say the Netherlands is one of these examples; we had outbreaks of Q fever, a disease in goats which caused a lot of problems in humans and still does. Again that was not recognised initially as a zoonotic disease and only at very late stages. It could have been one of the big examples of how human and veterinary work together in dealing with it, but when you look back into that, the lack of knowledge at the time or lack of understanding or recognising the knowledge that was there caused some delay\u2026 Coxiella burnetii was not recognised directly as the causative agent of syndromes in humans. Individual researchers may have said, this is the case, there\u2019s a real risk there \u2013 it was simply denied by other people in research or by the government at the time. It was not taken seriously, let\u2019s put it that way, whether it was denied, you know, I can\u2019t say. (Interview with the author, 20th March 2018)\n",

A weak relationship between evidence and policy is, however regrettable, not uncommon (Oliver and Cairney, 2019). Taken pessimistically, the insights of the interviewee could be taken to be a case of institutional paralysis caused by weak governmental leadership and deniability, which is also not uncommon in times of crisis (Boin et al., 2016), nor when it comes to managing disease\u2010induced outbreaks (Connolly, 2016). Nevertheless, it is fair to say that the case for knowledge integration has got much stronger and risen up the global policy agenda in recent times. A way forward is for city planners and policy makers to pay more attention to the benefits of long\u2010term collaborations given the ever\u2010present risks posed by urban animals in the context of economic development.",

There is no doubt that OH provides a positive and optimistic perspective for ensuring that systems and knowledge are integrated in order to allow policy makers and practitioners to best address such threats (e.g. Ebola, avian influenza), yet the approach can be criticised for its catch\u2010all view of complex problems. In some senses this is why the global development initiations, for example, through the UN\u2019s SDGs, reflect this overly optimistic ambition, which warrants the need for governance leadership for addressing urban change and health at a lower level in the system, supported by programmes to facilitate interdisciplinary knowledge exchange between professional groupings (such as vets, public health experts/medics and ecologists). The article also shows the adverse consequences of not adopting an integrated approach to health security, as demonstrated by the urban outbreaks of Q virus in the Netherlands (and others). Even if the individual citizen represents the key local responder by participating in animal/rodent control or eradication programmes (as we saw in the Jakarta example), then there can be unintended consequences of such approaches. Having said that, in some instances, such as rat infestations, there is often no choice but to incentivise people to look after themselves and the communities in which they live.",

            "text": "In short, OH is possible if there is a degree of strong mutuality of commitment to the agenda at international macro, meso, and micro (local/individual levels). This will be needed as the forces of globalisation become ever further enhanced (such as the leading role of China and other Asian markets in the world) and as countries grow rapidly, in economic terms, despite the persistence of acute levels of poverty and infrastructural problems (for example, India is likely to be the world\u2019s fifth global economy in 2020). The need for a long\u2010term OH approach is clear but its implementation is far from easy as it is very much a hostage of short\u2010term political considerations. There is evidence that major critical junctures in politics and governance represent barriers to long\u2010term collaborative efforts to address wicked and multi\u2010faceted health challenges \u2013 Brexit politics is a very contemporary example (see Connolly, 2019). In a similar way to Sir Michael Marmot\u2019s call for long\u2010term strategies to address acute health inequalities, by investing in initiatives to tackle the \u2018causes of the causes\u2019 of inequality (e.g. poor sanitation, habitation, poverty and societal inequalities) (Marmot and Wilkinson (2005), there needs to be a similar approach to urban planning in light of the fact that those at most risk of being infected by diseases hosted by animals are those who tend inhabit impoverished urban areas. Those living at the lower ends of society will be the ones more prone to the risks of infections due to low nutrition levels/generally poorer health who also tend to undertake jobs which can increase exposure to poor sanitation. In this context, the presence of urban animals, and the health consequences of urbanisation, will become ever more important areas for social science research. The priority for global health security must be on the leadership and coordination activities which build policy capacities at macro\u2010, meso\u2010 and micro\u2010levels.",
