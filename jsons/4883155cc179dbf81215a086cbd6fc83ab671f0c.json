A systematic review found that burnout was a predictor for conditions including musculoskeletal pain, prolonged fatigue, headaches, gastrointestinal and respiratory issues. 14 Some factors included in our survey, such as increased workload hours, inadequate PPE or not having updated guidelines, contributed to higher rates of infection among HCP at the beginning of the outbreak in late January. 15 Burnout was higher in those countries where the COVID-19 pandemic was surging at the time of data collection (e.g. U.S.) compared with those where it was declining (e.g. Italy) or had not reached the peak (e.g. Turkey). The lower reported burnout among HCPs in LMICs may reflect resilience due to more experience working in conditions with high adversity and limited availability of supplies. 16 Additionally, the greater reported burnout by HCPs in HICs could be attributed to their greater COVID-19 burden. Addressing burnout in all countries is important, but our findings indicate that different strategies should be tailored to the phase of pandemic and the sociocultural and healthcare organizational contexts.",
