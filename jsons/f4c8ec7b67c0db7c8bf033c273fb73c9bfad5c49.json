Some social and behavioral research activities (e.g. data analysis, manuscript preparation) can be continued from other environments with appropriate security protocols in place. For studies involving in-person interactions, continuity may be more difficult. Phone-based interactions provide a low-tech solution that may suffice in some cases. Yet, videoconferencing platforms can nearly replicate in-person interactions, activating both auditory and visual senses and potentially resulting in more substantial engagement. Staff can meet with participants individually or in groups, each seeing and hearing one another in real time. This paper provides guidance for researchers transitioning in-person assessments and interventions to a synchronous videoconferencing platform. Best practices, key considerations, examples from the field, and sample protocols are presented to ease transition for ongoing studies and maximize the potential of videoconferencing-and social distancing.",

While not as concerning as the lives that have been and will be lost due to this pandemic, social and behavioral HIV researchers are facing a situation that could stall or hinder data collection and intervention delivery. The health impacts of COVID-19 on participants and staff will likely affect many projects, but mhealth research projects will likely be less disrupted, as their platforms and interactions are largely impervious to social distancing measures. Ongoing research projects that have relied on in-person contact may be in jeopardy as people self-isolate, and as in-person data collection has been banned or discouraged by some institutions. This is problematic for achieving research objectives-especially considering the pandemic and related social distancing practices may continue for months. Stopping studies or data collection may also have unexpected negative impacts on participants. Participants living with and those at-risk for HIV who are currently enrolled in research may rely, in part, on remuneration from research participation to help with costs of food and housing. Additionally, the social connections participants experience from taking part in research may be especially valuable to their mental health-particularly during this pandemic, which is anxiety-inducing and isolating.",

Over the past 11 years, our team has been studying videoconferencing as a means of delivering interventions to people living with HIV (PLWH) [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . During that time, we have adapted programs to the videoconferencing platform and engaged in one-on-one as well as group-based videoconferencing interactions for research [4, 6, 8] . We have obtained promising findings regarding the feasibility, Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (https ://doi.org/10.1007/s1046 1-020-02837 -x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. acceptability and potential efficacy of videoconferencingadapted versions of the group-based Healthy Relationships intervention and a tobacco cessation program-both specific to PLWH [4, 6] . We have also engaged in focus groups and individual assessments over videoconferencing, resulting in quantitative and qualitative data to understand experiences and nuances [4, 6] . Moreover, our work has helped us to understand access to internet and devices needed for videoconferencing (i.e., \"smart-phones,\" tablets, desktops or laptop computers) and potential willingness to engage in videoconferencing individually and in groups [2, 3, 5, 9] . These experiences provide the basis for this manuscript, which reports on processes and considerations for rapidly implementing videoconferencing to connect with participants for data collection, as well as for individual and groupbased interventions. While spurred by the need for project continuity during this public health crisis, this article may also be beneficial for researchers who are planning to commence a study employing videoconferencing in the future.",

For interventions specific to living with HIV-or even those which involve discussing sexual risk behaviors with persons not living with HIV, seeing other's reactions to personal stories and revelations can make it much easier to share. When we initially adapted Healthy Relationships for videoconferencing, prior Healthy Relationships participants said they would miss \"the hugs\" [5] . Yet, in our work we found participants developed ways to successfully demonstrate their affection for group members, including putting their hands into a heart shape to communicate warmth. Additionally, the videoconferencing setting typically allows for screen sharing, which means content can be shared with participants in real time. We have implemented a virtual whiteboard [8] simply by opening a document and typing key points during individual or group interaction.

Individual video-calls may necessitate fewer requirements than group video-calls. For individual engagement with staff, we recommend participants attend while in a \"private space\" without distractions (people, pets, etc.) and sit in a room in which they can speak freely about HIV or other topics. If the space is noisy, we suggest they use headphones or ear buds. For our video-group interactions, we have always required a \"private space\", but have learned concrete rules are necessary (See Supplemental File 1). In our work, when we saw another person walking in the background of one participant's screen during a video-group session, we learned that it was important to define \"private space.\" Having other people in the background means persons not part of the group could see and hear other group members [6] , constituting privacy breeches that diminish trust in the process and the research team. If participants believe their privacy is being compromised, they may leave the group or not actively participate. We now require participants to join from a locked room in which they are the only person. Staff should also engage from private spaces with headphones or earbuds. If others must be in the room (i.e., you have an observer with the facilitator) the person should be introduced to the participant(s).

The security of the videoconferencing platform, especially when working with PWLH, may be the most important feature to consider. Steps being taken to ensure security should be clearly communicated with participants in simple language (See Supplemental File 2).

In this unprecedented time of social distancing, we expect support for using alternative approaches to achieve research continuity, but assure that approvals are in place before you pivot. Emailing a program/project officer may be sufficient for receiving funder approvals. Determine if rapid review by the institutional review board (IRB) is possible.

We were able to maintain the activity but the implementation was altered. While video-group participants cannot sit around a room together, they can see and hear one another in real time. In this study, we took advantage of the way our platform always showed the person who was speaking in a large box on the screen, and that the person who was speaking never saw their own face in that large box (instead, they saw the last person who spoke before themselves). Facilitators asked the person who would respond to the main speaker (we'll call her Diana) to say one word to cue the large box and asked the main speaker (let's call him Robert) to then begin the role play. This enabled Diana to see Robert's face in the large box during the dialogue, while Robert saw Diana's face at that same time (the others saw the person currently speaking in the large box). In doing this, Robert could feel more like he was speaking directly with Diana, while, Diana would feel as if she was speaking directly with Robert.",

In our work, participants have noted the connection they felt with staff and fellow participants. Relatedly, across intervention groups and studies, participants have developed hand gestures to express compassion. In a study of video-groups among women living with HIV, women made a fist with one hand, then held that wrist with their opposite hand and raised their arms just over their heads to indicate a hug. Similarly, to show support in a video-group tobacco cessation study, participants made the shape of a heart with their hands to show support. Despite not interacting with their peers in-person, participants developed strong social support and cohesion (e.g., \"That was what really brought us back, is, you know, the, the friendships that we have built here in, in talking to each other.
