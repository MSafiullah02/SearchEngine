            "text": "Members of family Coronaviridae cause a variety of diseases in birds and mammals. Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), a lesserresearched coronavirus, can infect naive pigs of any age, but clinical disease is observed in pigs \u05454 weeks of age. No commercial PHEV vaccines are available, and neonatal protection from PHEV-associated disease is presumably dependent on lactogenic immunity. Although subclinical PHEV infections are thought to be common, PHEV ecology in commercial swine herds is unknown. To begin to address this gap in knowledge, a serum IgG antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the S1 protein was developed and evaluated on known-status samples and then used to estimate PHEV seroprevalence in U.S. sow herds. Assessment of the diagnostic performance of the PHEV S1 ELISA using serum samples (n \u03ed 924) collected from 7-week-old pigs (n \u03ed 84; 12 pigs per group) inoculated with PHEV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus, or porcine deltacoronavirus showed that a sample-to-positive cutoff value of \u05460.6 was both sensitive and specific, i.e., all PHEV-inoculated pigs were seropositive from days postinoculation 10 to 42, and no cross-reactivity was observed in samples from other groups. The PHEV S1 ELISA was then used to estimate PHEV seroprevalence in U.S. sow herds (19 states) using 2,756 serum samples from breeding females (\u03fe28 weeks old) on commercial farms (n \u03ed 104) with no history of PHEV-associated disease. The overall seroprevalence was 53.35% (confidence interval [CI], \u03ee1.86%) and herd seroprevalence was 96.15% (CI, \u03ee3.70%). IMPORTANCE There is a paucity of information concerning the ecology of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) in commercial swine herds. This study provided evidence that PHEV infection is endemic and highly prevalent in U.S. swine herds. These results raised questions for future studies regarding the impact of endemic PHEV on swine health and the mechanisms by which this virus circulates in endemically infected populations. Regardless, the availability of the validated PHEV S1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) provides the means for swine producers to detect and monitor PHEV infections, confirm prior exposure to the virus, and to evaluate the immune status of breeding herds.",

This propensity for interspecies transmission justifies close examination of members of this family. Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), the focus of this study, is a swine coronavirus in the genus Betacoronavirus and related to other Betacoronavirus 1 species, including bovine coronavirus (BCoV), human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), equine coronavirus (ECoV), and canine respiratory coronavirus (CrCoV). PHEV-associated disease was first described in Canada in 1957 in nursery pigs exhibiting vomiting, anorexia, constipation, and severe progressive emaciation (9) . PHEV can produce vomiting and wasting disease (VWD) and/or encephalomyelitis, with mortality rates reaching 100% in neonatal pigs. Both clinical forms may occur simultaneously within a herd during an outbreak (10) . Clinical PHEV was subsequently reported in Belgium (11) , China (12) (13) (14) , Argentina (15) , South Korea (16) , and the United States (17) . More recently (2015), PHEV was associated with a case of influenza-like respiratory disease in 2015 in show pigs at a county fair in Michigan (18) .",

In contrast, information regarding the epidemiology or ecology of PHEV in contemporary farms is nearly entirely absent; even the seroprevalence of PHEV in most countries, including the United States, is unknown. To begin to address this shortfall, a serum IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the amino terminal portion (S1) of the PHEV spike protein was developed and evaluated under experimental conditions.

            "text": "Among the porcine coronaviruses, PHEV is the most poorly documented, even the frequency of PHEV infections in the field is unknown. Antibody testing is an accurate, efficient, and cost-effective method to collect population data, but laboratory throughput and antibody cross-reactivity between porcine coronavirus species can be problematic. Previous studies reported PHEV antibody detection by hemagglutination-based assays, virus neutralization (VN) tests, ELISA, and immunochromatographic-based tests (28-31), but their diagnostic performance under experimental or field conditions have not been as- sessed. Like all coronavirus, PHEV possesses four structural proteins: spike glycoprotein (S), nucleocapsid protein (N), small membrane protein (E), and transmembrane glycoprotein (M). In addition, similar to other Betacoronavirus 1 species, PHEV possesses a layer of envelope-associated glycoproteins (hemagglutinin-esterase) (2). With the exception of the intractable and well-documented cross-reactivity between TGEV and PRCV (32), serological differentiation among porcine coronaviruses can only been achieved by utilizing the S1 domain as the antigen in species-specific antibody tests (33) . Therefore, in the present study, the PHEV S1 protein was used as antigenic target instead of more conserved proteins (S2 domain, N, and M), because it contains major antigenic determinants distinct from those of other coronaviruses. The PHEV recombinant S1 protein was expressed under native (soluble) conditions using a eukaryotic (mammalian) expression system to preserve essential conformation and/or glycosylation-dependent epitopes and then used in an indirect ELISA for IgG antibody detection in serum samples. The lack of diagnostic specimens from pigs of precisely known infection status is the most common obstacle to the accurate assessment of the diagnostic performance of any diagnostic tool, regardless of platform. In this study, the diagnostic performance of the PHEV S1 ELISA was assessed using samples of precisely known infection status. Diagnostic specificity was assessed using porcine coronavirus-negative pigs, the time to detection and diagnostic sensitivity were evaluated using samples from pigs experimentally inoculated with PHEV, and the analytical specificity of the test was evaluated using serum samples from pigs inoculated with other porcine coronaviruses (TGEV, PRCV, PEDV, and PDCoV). Results from experimental samples showed that a cutoff S/P ratio of\u0546 0.6 on the PHEV S1 ELISA detected seroconversion in all PHEV-inoculated animals at \u054610 dpi and provided 100% diagnostic and analytical specificities, i.e., no cross-reactivity with other porcine coronaviruses was observed.",

Seroprevalence represents cumulative exposure to infection, and given the long duration of specific antibodies, it is less affected by seasonality or short-term fluctuations in transmissions than other parameters. This study confirms that PHEV is endemic in U.S. swine herds, with PHEV seroprevalence slightly higher in U.S. states with a higher pig density, i.e., Iowa, North Carolina, and Minnesota. The high seroprevalence of PHEV in sow farms juxtaposed with the general lack of reported clinical cases of VWD suggests a scenario in which clinical signs are either unrecognized and/or piglets are fully or partially protected against PHEV through lactogenic immunity. Further research is needed to better understand the ecology of PHEV in commercial swine herds and the role of lactogenic immunity in the protection of piglets against PHEV. Regardless, given their proven ability to mutate, recombine, and colonize new niches, maintaining a level awareness concerning the potential impact of porcine coronaviruses on animal health, public health, and the food supply would be prudent.",

The gene was amplified using the forward primers F1 (5=-AAACGGATCTCTAGCGAATTCGCCGCCACCATGTTCTTCATTCTGCTCATC-3=) and F2 (5=-GAGAACCTG TACTTCCAGAGCGACAAAACTCACACATGCC-3=) and reverse primers R1 (5=-GCTCTGGAAGTACAGGTTC TCGCGCCTACTCCGCAGGGCGG-3=) and R2 (5=-CGAGCGGCCGCTAGCAAGCTTTCATTTACCCGGAGACA GGG-3=). The amplicon was cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector (pNPM5; Novoprotein, Short Hills, NJ, USA), and the plasmid was transiently transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (1 \u03eb 10 6 cells/ml) (Invitrogen of Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY, USA) using polyethylenimine (PEI) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Transfected HEK293 cells were grown in serum-free FreeStyle 293 Expression medium (Gibco of Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 , and shaking at 120 rpm. Five days after transfection, the culture supernatant was harvested by centrifugation at 3,500 \u03eb g for 20 min and filtered using 0.45-m filters (Corning, Corning, NY, USA). The soluble expression of Fc-fused S1 protein (1,005 amino acids [aa], 112.3 kDa) was confirmed by dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide (12%) gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The Fc tag was enzymatically cleaved by incubation with TEV (20 IU/mg sample) for 3 h at 25\u00b0C under endotoxin control, to rule out potential contaminations with bacterial endotoxins. PHEV S1 was purified using protein A affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and nickel (Ni)-chelating Sepharose Fast Flow (SFF) affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare), according to the manufacturer's instructions.

The analytical specificity of the test was evaluated using samples (n \u03ed 440) collected from animals inoculated with PEDV, TGEV Miller strain, TGEV Purdue strain, PRCV, and PDCoV from 7 to 42 dpi. The PHEV S1 ELISA S/P serum IgG responses obtained for each inoculation group were plotted using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).",
