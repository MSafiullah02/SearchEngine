            "text": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is defined as an acute infection of the lung parenchyma acquired in the community, i.e., in outpatients or residents in long-term care facilities, >2 weeks before the onset of symptoms (Stigl and Marrie 2013). It can vary from a mild outpatient illness (Herold and Sailer 2004) to a more severe disease requiring hospital admission and, at times, intensive care (Niedemann 2015). The development of CAP may be related to either a defect in host defense, an exposure to an especially virulent pathogen, an overwhelming inoculum of microorganisms, or a combination of those factors (Stigl and Marrie 2013). Respiratory disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic liver disease, HIV infection, and other forms of immune suppression, chronic kidney disease, old age, malignancy, any neurologic illness that predisposes to aspiration including seizures, alcoholic abuse, smoking, and splenectomy, are predisposing host conditions (Niedemann 2015). The diagnosis of CAP, usually based on the presence of cough, fever, sputum production, and/or pleuritic chest pain, is supported by infiltrates detected on the chest radiography in most cases. CT is therefore rarely required. Typical causative organisms of bacterial CAP include gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) that is responsible for approximately one-third of all cases of CAP, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical pathogens, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae (formally Chlamydia), and Legionella (Niedemann 2015). Viral agents, such as influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus, may also be involved, as well as fungi and parasites.",

VAP is a type of HAP that develops more than 48\u201372 h after endotracheal intubation. HCAP is defined as pneumonia that occurs in settings of a nonhospitalized patient with extensive healthcare contact, such as wound care, residency in a nursing home, or hemodialysis. The latter pneumonia is increasingly caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. Common pathogens of HAP, VAP, and HCAP are found in both the Proteobacteria and the Firmicutes phylum and include aerobic gram-negative bacilli (e.g., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp.) and gram-positive cocci (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA], Streptococcus spp.) (Jones 2010). Nosocomial pneumonia due to viruses or fungi is significantly less common, except in the immunocompromised patient.",

            "text": "Today, CT has to be performed on a multidetector row CT scanner acquiring around 1 mm-thick sections and using an exposure dose which needs to be carefully chosen. Low-dose (LD) CT may be used without impairing the diagnostic information of specific CT patterns, in particular in case of pulmonary fungal infections (Christe et al. 2012), and even ultralow dose (ULD) CT may be possible, according to the clinical context. Overall, the dose may be decreased depending on the size of anomalies to be detected. If they are greater than 1 cm, which is often the case for patients with cystic fibrosis and suspected of acute pulmonary infections, ULD-CT at a dose that nearly reaches that of a chest X-ray may demonstrate the abnormalities, provided that the series are reconstructed with the correct technical parameters (Fig. 1). These doses also apply to the follow-up of this young population that is exposed to frequent ionizing radiation procedures during the whole life. In other cases, LD-CTs with a CTDI of 2\u20133 mGy.cm in non-obese patients (Bankier and Tack 2010) are perfectly suited for the follow-up of infectious lung diseases (Fig. 2). A comparison with previous baseline examinations is always required to accurately assess the disease\u2019s evolution. Of importance, although ULD-CT with a mean radiation expose dose of 0.60 \u00b1 0.15 mSv has been proven to provide acceptable image quality in case of pulmonary infections in febrile neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancy (Kim et al. 2014), caution must be taken due to potential pitfalls with LD-CT (Fig. 3). Multiplanar reformats with average intensity projection (AIP) post-processing of variable thickness may give rise to tomographic or chest X-ray appearance (Figs. 4 and 5) that may be compared with previous or following conventional chest X-rays. The use of maximum intensity projection (MIP) may optimize the detection of micronodules, which sometimes cannot be assessed by using thin slices alone (Fig. 6). It is also helpful to characterize micronodules as centrilobular ones with tree in bud appearance (Fig. 7), corresponding to a bronchocentric distribution, or as ones with a random distribution as seen in miliary disease (Fig. 8) (Beigelman-Aubry et al. 2005). The use of minimum intensity projection (mIP) allows to accurately locate an abnormal area in order to guide a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (Fig. 9), to differentiate bronchiectasis from a cavitary lesion (Fig. 1), to visualize the drainage bronchus in the latter situation, as well as to help to recognize a bronchopleural fistula.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "text": "Lobar pneumonia, characterized by an inflammatory exudate filling distal airspaces, typically begins in the lung area adjacent to the visceral pleura and spreads through the interalveolar pores of Kohn and the small airways from one segment to another (Muller 2003) respecting a centripetal pattern. Appearing as a single subpleural area of alveolar consolidation with blurred margins restricted to the area next to the fissures, it then progresses to a sublobar or lobar alveolar consolidation sharply demarcated by the interlobar fissure (Fig. 14) (Franquet 2008). An air bronchogram sign is strongly suggestive (Fig. 15) (Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4 et al. 1998). Ground-glass opacities adjacent to the alveolar consolidation corresponding to a partial filling of the alveoli may be observed (Fig. 16) (Tanaka et al. 1996). This aspect is the classical presentation of acute bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), mainly caused by S. pneumoniae (Bhalla and McLoud 1998), other agents responsible of complete lobar consolidation including Klebsiella pneumoniae, and other gram-negative bacilli, L. pneumophila, H. influenzae, and occasionally M. pneumoniae (Franquet 2008). A P. jirovecii infection, a fungal infection, or a mycobacteriosis has also to be considered in case of immunocompromised patients. An enlarged lobe with bulging fissures due to edematous engorgement may be observed, in particular with K. pneumoniae infection, with a current lower occurrence likely due to early treatment in case of suspected pneumonia (Walker et al. 2014).\n\n\n",

Bronchopneumonias are most commonly encountered in nosocomial infections and usually caused by gram-negative bacteria (GNB), especially P. aeruginosa or E. coli. Other commonly involved bacteria are S. aureus (Morikawa et al. 2012), Haemophilus influenzae, anaerobes, and some species of fungus, especially Aspergillus (Fig. 23). The latter as well as viruses (Franquet 2011) or atypical mycobacteriosis has to be considered when suggested by the individual clinical setting.

In viral infections and in those caused by M. pneumoniae, ground-glass attenuation is associated with signs of cellular bronchiolitis and focal consolidation fitting with bronchopneumonia. When a predominant ground-glass opacity occurs in an immunocompetent patient, respiratory syncytial virus or varicella infection should be first considered. In immunocompromised patients, P. jirovecii (Thomas and Limper 2004) CMV (McGuinness et al. 1994) or Mycoplasma infection must be suggested. P. jiroveci infections typically present as ground-glass opacity sparing the pulmonary cortex that predominantly affects the upper region, especially in AIDS patients (Fig. 25). A crazy-paving sign, defined as a combination of ground-glass opacity and smooth interlobular septal thickening that resembles a masonry pattern used in walkways (Hansell et al. 2008), may be observed in infections, in particular with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and influenza (Walker et al. 2014). Pulmonary cysts or pneumatoceles within the same areas should suggest PCP (Fig. 26). In immunocompromised non-HIV-positive patients, features are less suggestive of the diagnosis, with rapid progression, this being the result of severe or dysregulated inflammatory responses that are evoked by a relatively small number of Pneumocystis organisms (Chang et al. 2013; Tasaka and Tokuda 2012) (Fig. 27). In the latter category of patients, ground-glass opacities can also be caused by viral (Fig. 28) or pyogenic infection (Kang et al. 1996).\n\n\n\n",

In postprimary (reactivation) tuberculosis, centrilobular micronodules and linear branching opacities have a dense attenuation and distinct margins. These features are readily associated with cavitation, predominantly localized in the apical and posterior segments of the superior lobes and the superior segment of the lower lobes in this setting (Fig. 32). Aspergillus bronchiolitis and/or bronchopneumonia must be considered in immunocompromised patients (Logan et al. 1994).\nA hematogenous miliary pattern in case of random distribution may suggest tuberculosis (Figs. 8 and 33), histoplasmosis, candidiasis, blastomycosis, or a viral cause (CMV, herpes, varicella) (Fig. 34), especially in immunocompromised patients.\n\n\n",

Although inconstant, with a reported incidence of ranging from 25 to 95 % among neutropenic patients with hematological malignancies (Georgiadou et al. 2011), the HS strongly suggests an early invasive aspergillosis in patients with severe neutropenia (Fig. 37), in association with wedge-shaped areas of subpleural consolidation. Furthermore, initiation of antifungal treatment on the basis of the identification of an HS by chest CT appears associated with a significantly better response to treatment and improved survival (Greene et al. 2007). In invasive aspergillosis, these nodules typically become larger during neutrophil engraftment (Barnes and Marr 2007) and/or during the first 10 days of therapy (Caillot et al. 2001). Histopathologically, the HS represents a focus of pulmonary infarction surrounded by alveolar hemorrhage, secondary to invasion by Aspergillus of small and medium-sized pulmonary vessels causing thrombosis and subsequent ischemic necrosis of the lung parenchyma (Georgiadou et al. 2011). The same appearances have been reported in numerous infectious pulmonary diseases such as observed with Mucorales, Candida, herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, mycobacterial infections, bacterial pneumonia, or septic emboli (Fig. 38). The differential diagnoses of noninfectious nodules with an HS include granulomatosis with polyangiitis, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, adenocarcinoma, angiosarcoma, Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma in association with spiculated nodules, and hemorrhagic metastases (Georgiadou et al. 2011).\n\n",

The primary source of infection is tricuspid endocarditis, especially in intravenous illicit drug use, peripheral thrombophlebitis, venous catheter, and pacemaker wires. The mechanism includes endothelial damage combined with the formation of crumbling thrombi containing infective agents. Turbulences caused by the circulating blood detach fragments of thrombus which then migrate to the peripheral pulmonary arteries with consecutive obstruction. Ischemia then results in infarction and/or hemorrhage and the organisms release toxins causing parenchymal necrosis (Muller 2003). Nodules related to septic emboli are mainly peripheral and basal with blurred margins. A simultaneous appearance of solid nodules and nodules with variable size cavitations (Fig. 38) as well as subpleural wedge-shaped consolidation may be seen (Franquet 2008). The nodules often appear to have a vessel leading into them on axial views \u2013 the so-called \u201cfeeding vessel\u201d sign \u2013 corresponding to the pulmonary vein, whereas most arteries have a lateralized trajectory around the nodule (Dodd et al. 2006) (Fig. 39).\n",

It usually displays an acute angle when it intersects with an adjacent pleural surface. Consolidation in the adjacent parenchyma occurs in half of all cases (Muller 2003). Bronchopulmonary fistula may be observed. As the most frequent cause of lung abscess is aspiration, the most common localizations are the posterior segment of an upper lobe or the superior segment of a lower lobe (Muller 2003). Bilateral involvement that predominantly affects the lung bases with abscess formation suggests a P. aeruginosa infection. Infections caused by anaerobic bacteria are commonly encountered, abscesses caused by S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa being associated with higher mortality (Francis et al. 2005).",

Right paratracheal, hilar, and subcarinal regions and/or hilar lymph node enlargement with associated homolateral small focal infiltrate or parenchymal consolidation, which is commonly sublobar and subpleural in location in the middle lobe, basal segments of lower lobes, and anterior segments of upper lobes, is the usual hallmark of primary TB (Beigelman et al. 2000). Necrotic components with peripheral rim enhancement (rim sign) mainly suggest tuberculosis, but they can also correspond to fungal infection, atypical mycobacteria, histoplasmosis, metastases (Fig. 46) from head/neck and testicular malignancy, and lymphoma (Bhalla et al. 2015). Bronchonodal fistula can be observed as a complication of active pulmonary TB with TB lymphadenitis especially in the elderly. The fistulas usually involve the right lobar bronchus and the main bronchus on the left side (Park et al. 2015).\n\nA circumferential thickening of the esophagus may be related to a cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, esophagitis being the second most common gastrointestinal manifestation of this organism after colitis (Wang et al. 2015), or Candida (Kuyumcu 2015) infection in immunocompromised patients.In case of a circumferential thickening of the trachea or main bronchi occurring in the same context, the possibility of invasive aspergillosis of the respiratory tract should always be considered (Fig. 47) with the specific risk of tracheal rupture. Acute tuberculous tracheobronchial involvement may also be seen with circumferential narrowing associated with smooth or irregular wall thickening (Bhalla et al. 2015). Sequelar fibrotic bronchostenosis predominating on the left main bronchus and post-obstructive bronchiectasis may occur in this setting (Bhalla et al. 2015).\nAcute infectious mediastinitis may rarely be observed. It appears as increased soft tissue attenuation of mediastinal fat with fluid collections, air bubbles, air-fluid levels, and pneumomediastinum, with pericardial/pleural effusion. Regarding chronic or fibrosing mediastinitis, especially related to tuberculosis and fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, aspergillosis, mucormycosis, cryptococcosis, and blastomycosis, CT may display focal or diffuse involvement with calcifications as well as stenosis/obstruction of the vessels, airways, or esophagus (Akman et al. 2004).\n",

Most of the parapneumonic effusions without pleural thickening resolve under adequate medical treatment.\nEmpyema, which occurs in less than 5 % of pulmonary infections, typically displays obtuse angles along its interface with adjacent pleura. It appears as a smooth and thin enhancement of the visceral and parietal pleura that surrounds the fluid collection and that is referred as the split pleura sign (Walker et al. 2014) (Figs. 10 and 11). It is commonly associated with a hyperattenuation of the extra-pleural fat. The pathogens traditionally involved in empyema are S. pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and S. aureus. The same findings may be seen in case of TB.In this setting, an air-fluid level suggests a bronchopleural fistula (Walker et al. 2014), which is a sinus tract between a bronchus and the pleural space that most often results from a necrotizing pneumonia. CT features of bronchopleural fistula include an intrapleural airspace of various sizes, a new or changed air-fluid level, and, possibly, a fistulous communication, which may be become visible after the use of mIP post-processing. The air-fluid level within the pleura usually exhibits a length disparity when comparing posterior and lateral chest radiographs or between coronal and sagittal reformats unlike an air-fluid level associated with a pulmonary abscess typically displaying a spherical shape (Walker et al. 2014).\n",

A wavy periosteal reaction highly suggests thoracic actinomycosis.Concomitant small hypodense lesions in the liver and/or spleen may suggest pyogenic abscesses or fungal infections, in particular candidiasis.A worsening of CT findings may be encountered in case of \u201cimmune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome\u201d (IRIS). This syndrome is related to paradoxical worsening of preexisting infectious processes such as mycobacterial, viral, and Pneumocystis jirovecii infection following the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV-infected individuals, a low CD4+ T-cell count being a major risk factor (Huis in \u2018t Veld et al. 2012). IRIS syndrome may also be encountered in HIV-negative patients in conditions such as following corticosteroid withdrawal, discontinuation of antitumor necrosis factor-alpha therapy or recovery of neutropenia after cytotoxic chemotherapy, and engraftment of stem cell transplantation. It may be then observed in case of aspergillosis, candidiasis, and viral pneumonitis (Cheng et al. 2000).\n",
