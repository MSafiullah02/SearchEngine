Our knowledge with regard to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues to evolve, as do our institutional protocols for dealing with invasive and non-invasive procedures and practice of personal protective equipment (PPE).

POCUS is usually conducted by the treating provider to obtain real-time information for management decisions. Cardiac views are frequently obtained along with non-cardiac views such as the chest (lung, pleura) and vessels (neck and leg veins, aorta). In infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in particular, POCUS may help triage the dyspneic patient and determine need for subsequent imaging (echocardiogram, echo; computerized tomography, CT; etc). A modified version of the ASE POCUS protocol may be of value in suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection (Figure 1). The base ASE POCUS protocol can be accessed free online at: https://aseuniversity.org/ase/lessons/47. 2 Cardiac POCUS: A well-illustrated case series of the application of focused ultrasound in patients with severe COVID-19 infection and associated cardiovascular (CV) disease from Wuhan was recently presented. 3 Table 1 lists cardiac POCUS findings and indications. Early reports suggest that cardiac POCUS indications in COVID-19 include: 1. Detection or characterization of pre-existing CV disease.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "Characteristic lung findings in preliminary publications are consistent with a viral pneumonia: a thickened and irregular pleural line, and scattered B-lines (mild disease). In severe disease, this can progress to confluent B-lines with pulmonary consolidation, including air bronchograms. POCUS is useful to exclude other chest pathologies in critically ill patients, such as pneumothorax (particularly in patients on positive pressure ventilation) and symptomatic large pleural effusion. Vascular POCUS for procedural guidance and access is well established in acute settings. Assessment of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and/or jugular venous pulsation (JVP) plays an important role in hemodynamic assessment of critically ill patients to enhance the physical exam and in the assessment of fluid status. Deep vein thrombosis risk increases with any critically ill bed-bound patient; moreover, early reports indicate an association between COVID-19 and a prothrombotic state. A unilateral DVT study performed by a sonographer is relatively quick and focused. However in the case that a sonographer is not available, and in context of the pandemic, the 2-point compression POCUS technique may be considered by practitioners trained in the technique. 5 When to Perform POCUS in COVID-19? Not all patients with COVID-19 infection require a POCUS examination. However if cardiac and chest ultrasound is indicated, some institutions may choose POCUS as the first-line application of ultrasound. Deterioration in clinical status may then trigger a more extensive exam such as a limited transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) guided by the POCUS images. The primary advantage of using POCUS first in COVID-19 is reduction of exposure to other personnel and locations, permitting conservation of PPE. Disadvantages include potentially poorer imaging resolution compared with systems used for comprehensive TTE, missed findings, operator inexperience, archiving issues, and inability to immediately convert the POCUS to a comprehensive examination if needed. 6 A workflow algorithm for patients with COVID-19 infection in whom further cardiopulmonary ultrasound is indicated is provided in Figure 2. If POCUS examination is available, and the scan sufficiently answers the clinical question, then the need for subsequent TTE may be obviated. If the POCUS scan is insufficient, or reveals findings requiring comprehensive evaluation, then TTE may be considered as appropriate. Limited TTE can be planned and guided by the POCUS findings to minimize sonographer exposure. In some instances, POCUS may be insufficient to exclude a suspected cardiac abnormality, for example in the case of difficult image acquisition, and it may be more efficient for a skilled sonographer to rapidly scan the patient, rather than have a POCUS operator struggle with prolonged attempts. Judicious use of ultrasound must be considered to avoid unnecessary exposure of personnel to contagion and conserve the use of limited resources such as PPE. Caution must be exercised to ensure that the suggested POCUS workflow algorithm is not increasing utilization of unnecessary or inappropriate TTE. How to Perform POCUS in COVID-19 infection Safety and cleaning: PPE implementation for sonographers, and machine cleaning principles are described in the parent document to this supplement and apply to POCUS. Because of the size and flexibility of POCUS devices, institutions may decide to dedicate these devices to a fixed location, such as an isolated COVID-19 unit, with meticulous cleaning between patient exams and at the end of each day in a dedicated cleaning storage facility within 7 the unit. The suggestions for scanning and cleaning are summarized in", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "Additional information on transducer cleaning can be found on the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) website. 8 Archiving and storage: Given the potential for deterioration in patients with COVID-19 infection, every attempt should be made to store, archive and document POCUS results to allow for image comparison. This helps to reduce the need for repeat scans that would impinge upon scarce PPE resources, and the risk of exposure. At the very least, results should be documented in the physical exam or investigations section of the patient's chart. Who Should Perform POCUS? All POCUS practitioners should operate within their skillset as described by the ASE Recommendations for Echo Labs Participating in POCUS and Critical Care Echocardiography Training. 9 Some users may have POCUS credentials from societies such as the American College of Chest Physicians and/or the Society for Hospital Medicine. Many institutions have planned for the possibility of a tiered response to the crisis, as proposed by the Society of Critical Care Medicine. 10 In such a response, non-intensivist physicians might be directly managing patients with COVID-19. Novice practitioners may be recruited to use POCUS in the midst of a surge of patients. These individuals should receive proper training, but the usual modes of teaching by practicing on patients are currently inadvisable. Simulators are an approach to introduce POCUS image acquisition and interpretation.
