The infection comes to a town that is obsessed with business, a place where the sole object seems to be the pursuit of wealth. The authorities are slow off the mark, reluctant to act because of the economic consequences and the reputational damage to the town. Mitigation measures are mired in bureaucracy, until, as fevers spike and bedsheets are soaked from night-sweats, there is no choice but to quarantine the town: \u201cWe should not act as though half the town were not threatened with death, because then it would be.\u201d",

The cast of characters is eerily familiar: the Prefect who begins in denial, but then has no choice but to bow to the expertise of his medical advisers once the exponential spread of disease becomes apparent; the coward who tries to escape the lockdown, careless of the spread of infection beyond the walls; the priest who sermonises that it is a punishment from God; the nihilist who snaps, after months confined to his room, and sprays bullets randomly into the street; the philosopher who comes to the conclusion that we all have infection somewhere inside us: \u201cWe must keep endless watch on ourselves lest in a careless moment we breathe in somebody's face and fasten the infection on him.

            "text": "Albert Camus's La Peste (The Plague) was published in 1947. The conventional academic wisdom about the novel is that the bubonic plague is intended as an allegory for the infection of Nazism. After all, Camus was a heroic fighter in the French Resistance. But this interpretation has always puzzled me. Camus set the novel in an Algerian port where there had been cholera outbreaks. And he did a lot of research about bubonic and pneumonic plague. Re-reading the novel under lockdown, I was reminded of the saying attributed to Sigmund Freud in response to those who find phallic symbols everywhere: \u201csometimes a cigar is just a cigar\u201d. Sometimes\u2014at this time especially\u2014we should read The Plague as a novel about a plague.",

This is seen in the courage and the camaraderie, the industry and the ingenuity, of health-care workers worldwide in the response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Writers, by contrast, might feel powerless. Home alone is their usual habitat, so for them social distancing is nothing new. And they might take some comfort in the thought that as the world comes to a halt, more people are turning to books. The dying art of slow reading of long, complex books is being revived. But should our lockdown reading list include novels such as The Plague? For some, a story of this kind will cut too close to the bone\u2014an escape into A Game of Thrones or Jane Austen might seem infinitely preferable. But I would argue that a dose of Camus is precisely what we need at such a time. There is hope in the knowledge that our species has weathered plague after plague throughout history, and that the testament of writers stands as an enduring witness to the human capacity to survive, to learn, to value things that matter, such as the simple beauties of nature, and, above all, to love. For me, no one articulates this better than Camus's doctor\u2013narrator, Bernard Rieux, in his magnificent peroration as the plague abates:",

Aristotle voiced a similar view of tragedy, although he used an ancient Greek medical term: catharsis. For Hippocrates, the term referred to medical treatments that involved cleansing poisonous liquids or discharging body fluids through vomiting and diarrhoea. Aristotle gave it a psychological application: we are all subject to powerful and potentially unhealthy feelings of fear and pity. The healthy way of purging them is through storytelling in the safe space of the theatre.",

The people need to find someone to blame, to identify a scapegoat (at this time, one inevitably thinks of US President Donald Trump's references to \u201cthe Chinese virus\u201d). As the action unfolds, Oedipus gradually comes to see that he must look to himself, not to some foreign infection. He discovers that he has done the worst that can possibly be imagined: in complete ignorance, he has killed his father and slept with his mother. His only recourse is self-blinding and exile, after which the city is cured of its plague. Logically and medically, there is no causal connection between his transgressions and the epidemic; but symbolically and morally, he must as a leader take responsibility for the sickness of his people. He functions as the pharmakos, the means of purification or atonement for Thebes. Meanwhile for the original Athenian audience of the play, which was performed at a time when they were reeling from a disease outbreak, the act of witnessing Oedipus's confrontation with the horror of his deeds purges their own feelings of pity and fear stirred by the epidemic.",
