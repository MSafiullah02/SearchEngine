Detailed outbreak investigations often include laboratory testing of close contacts and of health-care workers (HCWs), regardless of symptoms, and specialized serological investigations will include individuals thought to be at higher risk of infection, such as HCWs or those with occupational exposure to animal reservoirs. Estimates of the true prevalence of infection of high-risk pathogens are important to understand the populations required for vaccine candidates or specific therapeutic treatments as and when they become available. In addition, the role of subclinical or asymptomatic infection is critical in understanding chains of transmission missed by surveillance systems. For MERS-CoV, asymptomatic infection has been reported to WHO, but the possibility of transmission prior to symptom onset is critical for recommending effective infection prevention and control measures and for reducing secondary MERS-CoV transmission.",

For severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV, limited transmission to close contacts before symptom onset or hospitalization has been found in transmission-risk studies outside health-care settings, whereas human-to-human transmission within health-care settings was higher, likely due to higher viral load in hospitalized patients and more frequent exposure to the virus among HCWs (16\u201318).",

Outside of health-care settings, the evidence of MERS-CoV infection has largely been focused on individuals with occupational exposure to dromedaries. The results to date are heterogenous, and although attempts have been made to evaluate MERS-CoV genetic diversity (59, 60), the differences in seroprevalence results to date likely reflect differences in the selection and characteristics of dromedary herds and humans tested. The available evidence of the MERS-CoV epidemiologic and genetic characteristics does not suggest there are differences in the virus\u2019s ability to infect humans. Evidence supports that individuals with occupational exposure to dromedaries have higher rates of seroprevalence compared with household contacts of patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection, likely reflecting more intense, unprotected exposures to MERS-CoV through dromedary secretions (61). That these individuals have subclinical infection and do not develop disease is likely because those with occupational exposure tend to be younger and healthier, without underlying high-risk conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and renal failure. Variations in the seroprevalence rates by study are also likely due to variations in methodologies, including the timing of sample collection, serologic assays used, and interpretation of assay results.",

Additional serological and molecular epidemiology studies at the dromedary-human interface using a standardized approach and consistent methodology, in the Arabian Peninsula and in Africa and South Asia, are needed to further understand this observed heterogeneity\u2014that is, whether the observed differences in evidence of infection outside health-care settings may be attributable to genetic variation of the virus across different geographic regions and/or to factors and behaviors in human populations in these regions, which may change the susceptibility to infection. WHO is currently supporting studies underway in several countries in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia in which the extent of infection in occupationally exposed persons is being evaluated . The results of such studies can contribute to better understanding the geographic reach of MERS-CoV in dromedaries and humans.",

Timely and repeated biological specimen collection is needed to capture viral shedding and antibody kinetics of symptomatic and asymptomatic contacts (11). This can be achieved if all high-risk contacts of patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection are identified during an outbreak and then tested using molecular and serologic laboratory assays, regardless of whether the individual exhibits symptoms. In outbreak settings, without the inclusion of testing of all contacts, the identification of chains of transmission may be incomplete.",

Because HCWs tend to be younger and healthier than patients in whom severe MERS develops, HCWs have fewer symptoms, if any, and present a silent risk of human-to-human transmission to others. Among HCW contacts, detailed studies of viral shedding and immune response of asymptomatic, PCR-positive MERS-CoV infections are urgently needed and should be conducted when outbreaks occur and enhanced surveillance is put in place by government and hospital officials.",

In addition, the systematic testing of HCWs, extending beyond nurses and doctors to include reception staff, cleaners, technicians, and so forth, regardless of the development of symptoms, as required by the latest infection prevention and control guidelines for HCWs by WHO and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, for example, has detected subclinical and asymptomatic infections that likely would have gone undetected in past outbreaks. Asymptomatic infections may have played a role in extensive secondary transmission in health-care settings before the latest guidelines were introduced, and the impact of such policies may be reflected in the lower peaks on the global MERS-CoV epidemic curve since 2016. Without this level of contact follow-up in community settings, the extent of asymptomatic infections in the community will remain unknown.",
