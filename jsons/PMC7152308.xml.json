The need for regulations has become more acute with the advent of modern transportation systems that allow movement of animals from any part of the world in a matter of hours.

The USDA expended considerable experimental effort to determine the risk. It was concluded that llamas and alpacas could be infected by inoculation but did not acquire FMD when cohabiting with infected swine, in contrast with almost 100% of cattle that acquired the infection.6, 25, 30 The virus could not be detected after 14 days postinoculation.",
