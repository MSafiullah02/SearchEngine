The inhibition of ADKs against SCV Hel ATPase activity was measured by a phosphate release assay: phosphate release during ATP hydrolysis by SCV Hel was measured by colorimetric method based on complex formation with malachite green and molybdate (AM/MG reagent).13, 14 Briefly, a 25 \u03bcl solution of SCV helicase (400 nM) in 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 6.6) buffer was added to each well of the 96-well assay plate which already contained 0.5 \u03bcl of various concentrations of chemical compounds.15 After incubation for 5 min at rt, reactions were started by adding 25 \u03bcl of reaction solution [50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 6.6), 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 4 mM ATP, 4 nM circular ssDNA M13] to each well and then further incubated for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C. The reactions were stopped by adding 200 \u03bcl of AM/MG reagent (0.034% malachite green, 1.05% ammonium molybdate, 0.04% Tween 20, in 1 M HCl) and the color was developed for 5 min at rt. Absorbance at 620 nm was measured and the amount of phosphate released was quantitated using inorganic phosphate standard curve. Each experiment was repeated three times and averaged. As shown in Figure 2\na and Table 1\n, no ADK investigated in this study showed significant inhibition activity against the enzyme. Among them, only 1 and 4 exhibited moderate inhibition activities against helicase ATPase with IC50 values of 41.3 and 24.4 \u03bcM, respectively.",

            "text": "The inhibition of ADK analogues against the SCV Hel duplex DNA-unwinding activity was measured by FRET-based assay as previously described16, 17 and the results are summarized in Figure 2b and Table 1. Similar to the helicase ATPase assay, neither 2 nor 3 showed inhibition of helicase duplex DNA-unwinding activity even at a concentration of 100 \u03bcM, and the inhibitory activities of 1 and 6 were only marginal (39.9 and 28.7 \u03bcM, respectively). However, three ADK analogues showed modest to potent inhibition of SCV Hel duplex DNA-unwinding activity with IC50 values of 13.6 (4), 5.4 (7), and 11.0 \u03bcM (8), which are comparable to those of the previously reported inhibitors including bismuth complexes (3.0\u201311.0 \u03bcM),8 HE602 (6.0 \u03bcM),18 and vanillinbananin (2.7 \u03bcM).3 It is worth to note that, unlike bismuth complexes which showed the same order of inhibition in both ATPase and duplex DNA-unwinding assay,8 the ADK analogues showed selective inhibition against the duplex DNA-unwinding activity. Thus, it is conceivable that the ADKs might have mechanism of inhibition different from that of the bismuth complexes. Also noteworthy is that the ADK analogues are the only SCV Hel inhibitors reported to date with structure\u2013activity relationships: the regiochemistry as well as the aromatic substituent dramatically influence the anti-SCV activities of the ADKs. In particular, compounds with para-relationship between the diketoacid moiety and the OCH2Ar group (1 and 2) do not show antiviral activities. Also, the chlorine substituent on the terminal aromatic ring has completely different effects on the inhibitory activities of the ADKs. In comparison with 7, the inhibitory activity against the target enzyme of 8 is rarely affected by chlorination. On the contrary, chlorine substitution resulted in significant changes in antiviral activities of 4 and 6 in comparison with their unsubstituted counterparts 3 and 5. Taken together, this result suggests a possible specific binding site for the ADKs in the SCV Hel, which warrants further investigation of more structurally diverse ADK analogues on their anti-SCV activities to provide definitive structure\u2013activity relationships as well as the possible binding site.",
