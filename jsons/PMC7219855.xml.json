As communities strive to control infectious outbreaks, the virus continues to cause substantial economic, social, and political disruption. As emergency departments are preparing for increased volume because of infected patients, the closure of non-emergency health-care facilities may further increase inappropriate demand on emergency medical staff. Approximately 77% of all injury-related health-care visits in the U.S. are for musculoskeletal injuries1, totaling >65 million visits in 2010 and 2011. Thus, to lessen the burden on emergency department personnel, it is vital for continued limited operation of orthopaedic outpatient centers. Additionally, recent government mandates are now excluding medical care and treatment for elective procedures, thus causing ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) to cease operations for non-urgent orthopaedic-related procedures; however, for certain pathologies, inability to operate or failure to recognize injuries that are \u201csurgically necessary\u201d may result in serious long-term health consequences, including neurological, vascular, and joint morbidity.",

In addition to minimizing the exposure of patients to the coronavirus, the purpose of this recommendation is to also limit the use of essential items, such as personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilators, and cleaning supplies2. These recommendations also aim to minimize the potential for complications following elective procedures that would result in further depletion of the aforementioned items and increase need for the hospital beds required to care for COVID-19 patients, as well as to prepare for a potential surge of critically ill patients at all inpatient centers. Guidelines allow a health-care provider the time and availability necessary care for COVID-19 patients, and minimize potential exposure to COVID-19 for patients and health-care workers.",

Elective or non-urgent cases have been reported to be those for which there would be no anticipated short or long-term negative impact in delaying the procedure3. Surgical necessity in the context of the current pandemic can be defined as urgent pathologies that could lead to long-term disability and/or chronic pain if acute surgical treatment is delayed. These decisions regarding elective versus elective-urgent cases should be made concurrently with the input of local and state governmental officials (such as the Department of Health) with the input of the individual surgical facility and hospital system leadership, as well as the treating surgeon. In addition, these decisions should be refined on the basis of the duration of the COVID-19 crisis, current and projected prevalence of COVID-19 cases, health and age of the patient, staffing availability, and the local PPE supply until officials are confident that the COVID-19 cases have peaked and that the local health-care infrastructure can support a return to normalcy4. As reported, there is a current critical shortage of PPE, and thus the priority remains to secure adequate PPE for front-line medical professionals5. As the supply chain is mobilized and front-line demand is met, ASCs could be resupplied. This would allow ASCs to then unload the burden of outpatient cases from larger facilities. Critical aspects of the virus, such as the reproductive number, morbidity, and mortality, must be established to determine allocation of resources, including the use of outpatient surgery centers. The initial response to a pandemic will evolve and thus the evaluation around the allocation and utilization of health-care resources must be a dynamic process. The manner in which resources are utilized in the initial phases could potentially be different from that in latter phases.",

In particular for this COVID-19 crisis, outpatient surgical procedures that are scheduled for inpatient facilities should be considered for rescheduling to outpatient facilities whenever possible in order to minimize asymptomatic individuals being exposed to facilities that have relatively higher levels of exposure to COVID-19 (e.g., hospitals). In addition, limiting visitors to all but minor patients, the mentally/physically disabled, and elderly patients who require assistance should be performed. Furthermore, to help reduce the likelihood of disease transmission, ASCs should institute additional measures to maximize patient safety, such as the administration of appropriate screening tests (e.g., travel history and/or history of recent illness), body temperature, respiratory symptoms, and screening of staff for signs of illness or other risk factors until an accurate and highly sensitive rapid test for the diagnosis of COVID-19 illness or antibodies is available. We recommend that each outpatient facility should follow protective guidelines for staff during procedures and ensure that all who are present during intubation and extubation have access to appropriate PPE, including N95 masks, and ensure that terminal cleaning of all operating rooms and equipment be performed between cases.",

It is also important to be forward-thinking and clearly define those patients who could suffer long-term consequences if a surgical procedure is postponed. Currently, although there are recommendations on which surgical procedures to avoid and which are emergencies (such as fractures, vascular compromise, compartment syndrome, and infection), there are no clear recommendations on which procedures should be considered important enough to be performed in outpatient centers because of the long-term negative impact that a delayed procedure could pose to these patients. A rationale and data-driven process to assess and communicate which procedures should be allowed to be performed is essential. In order to both limit orthopaedic surgical procedures and best manage health-care resources during this public health emergency, detailed criteria are needed to indicate which patients are deemed necessary candidates for acute surgical treatment for elective procedures. In general, surgical procedures ought to be considered necessary for:Acute and/or disabling injuries to health-care workers, first responders, and members of the military and police and fire departments.Osseous fractures and/or irreducible joint dislocations.Wound/joint infections or postoperative wound dehiscence.",

The decision must then be determined by the assessment of the real risk of proceeding or delaying, the availability of the facility and resources, the safety of the community in the particular region, and the regulations dictated by the local authorities. On the other hand, if the lockdown periods are extended, it might be prudent to consider fewer restrictions on elective procedures for low-risk individuals, which might allow those who are currently restricted from work or unemployed the opportunity to have and recover from these procedures and be better ready to reenter the work force when the governing bodies release restrictions. Not allowing these low-risk patients the opportunity to have a surgical procedure sooner would result in further delays in return to work.",

Although it is essential to best utilize resources in the battle against COVID-19, it will also be important to ensure we delineate our responsibilities and avoid long-term disability, pain, and, if restrictions are substantially prolonged, further loss of employment and production by performing these important orthopaedic procedures in patients who cannot wait until the U.S. health-care system returns to normal operations.",
