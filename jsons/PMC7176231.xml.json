It also showed that, compared to \u201cno food,\u201d early enteral nutrition had an important influence on immediate unspecific cellular immunity and an activating effect on specific cellular immunity. This was indicated by the significantly higher number of circulating NK cells, monocytes, a larger expression of HLA-DR, and a tendency to larger numbers of T-lymphocyte subpopulations when patients were given early enteral nutrition (Beier-Holgersen and Brandstrup 2012).",

This response is due to two subpopulations of CD4+ T lymphocytes, which are known, respectively, as Th1 and Th2. In the healthy human, there is a constant balance between Th1 and Th2 cells. It is the undifferentiated CD4+ T lymphocyte which, in an immune response, can transmute to either a Th1 or a Th2 cell. Which way it changes depends on which cytokines are released by the antigen-presenting cells. Th1 inhibits the production of Th2, and vice versa. Th1 excretes cytokines which activate macrophages and inflammation and increases the production of opsonizing antibodies which promote phagocytosis. Thus Th1 initiates a cellular immune response. The cytokines produced by Th2 induces B-lymphocyte proliferation and the production of neutralizing antibodies, thus triggering a humoral immune response.",

The cells most frequently studied are CD4+, CD8+, NK, monocytes, CD19+, and the subgroups of all these cell lines. Some studies have found a significant increase in the cellular parameters after IED and some have found no significant changes. Some have shown a shift towards a Th1-dominated CD4+ population by reducing the number of Th2 cells when IEDs have been given. A meta-analysis (Zheng et al. 2007) of 13 relevant papers concluded that IEDs were safe and effective in reducing postoperative infection and the length of stay in hospital by increasing humoral and cellular immunity. Another meta-analysis (Mabvuure 2013) of 6 RCTs on patients undergoing esophagogastric resection concluded that, even though postoperative IED seems to improve humoral immunity, it does not reduce the rate of infections or the length of stay in hospital. It is not clear whether IEDs have a positive effect on cellular immunity. As stated above, the literature draws very contradictory conclusions. This is probably due to very heterogeneous patient populations, the different compositions of IEDs, and different ways of measuring the immunological markers. The results are therefore difficult to compare. A look at the different guidelines issued by the American, European, and Canadian societies for nutrition (CCPG, ASPEN, and ESPEN) shows that they too have contradictory opinions on IEDs. ESPEN and ASPEN recommend arginine in elective surgery, whereas CCPG does not find sufficient evidence of a beneficial effect. None of them recommend glutamine or omega-3 FA in elective surgery. When it comes to trauma patients, CCPG finds no benefit in arginine, whereas ASPEN and ESPEN find it beneficial. All three find glutamine beneficial or possibly beneficial. In patients with sepsis, none of the societies recommend glutamine or omega-3 FA, and all of them indicate potentially harmful effects when given arginine.
