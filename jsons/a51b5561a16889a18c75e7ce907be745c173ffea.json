In humans, \u03b12,6-SA receptors are more abundantly expressed in the upper respiratory tract than \u03b12,3-SA receptors, which are predominantly distributed in the lower respiratory tract [32] . Consistent with the receptor-binding pattern, A(H7N9) replication was more efficient in lung tissue than in the trachea [33] . Therefore, the preference of A(H7N9) virus binding to \u03b12,3-SA receptor over the \u03b12,6-SA counterpart and the robust viral replication in lung tissue may constitute the biological basis for the clinical manifestation of human A(H7N9) influenza as primarily a lower respiratory tract infection.

A recent study clearly demonstrated that the volume of inoculum can affect disease severity of the A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in ferrets. The same dose of virus in a greater inoculation volume can optimally deliver the viruses to the lower respiratory tract and caused more severe diseases in ferrets [34] .

B, A total of 9 putatively functional variants in vicinity of TMPRSS2 gene were applied to LD analysis with association SNP rs2070788, based on genotype data for CHB and ASN populations from the 1000 Genomes Project.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Demographic and Clinical Profiles of Patients With Severe Cases and Controls With Mild A(H1N1)pdm09 Infection", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Patients, No. (%)a\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Patient Profile\n</td><td>Severe Infection (n = 162)b </td><td>Mild Infection (n = 247) </td><td>P Valuec</td></tr><tr><td>Demographic characteristic\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Age, median years (interquartile range) </td><td>56 (45-65) </td><td>40 (25-55) </td><td>&lt;.001\n</td></tr><tr><td>Female </td><td>64 (39.5) </td><td>142 (57.5) </td><td>&lt;.001\n</td></tr><tr><td>Risk conditions\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Age \u226565 y </td><td>43 (26.5) </td><td>35 (14.2) </td><td>.003\n</td></tr><tr><td>Pregnancy </td><td>1 (0.6) </td><td>8 (3.2) </td><td>.094\n</td></tr><tr><td>Chronic pulmonary disease </td><td>49 (30.2) </td><td>24 (9.7) </td><td>&lt;.001\n</td></tr><tr><td>Chronic cardiac disease </td><td>36 (22.2) </td><td>26 (10.5) </td><td>.002\n</td></tr><tr><td>Metabolic disorders </td><td>47 (29.0) </td><td>35 (14.2) </td><td>&lt;.001\n</td></tr><tr><td>Chronic renal disease </td><td>18 (11.1) </td><td>13 (5.3) </td><td>.035\n</td></tr><tr><td>Chronic hepatic disease </td><td>5 (3.1) </td><td>8 (3.2) </td><td>&gt;.99\n</td></tr><tr><td>Neurological conditions </td><td>23 (14.2) </td><td>17 (6.9) </td><td>.017\n</td></tr><tr><td>Hemoglobinopathy </td><td>1 (0.6) </td><td>2 (0.8) </td><td>&gt;.99\n</td></tr><tr><td>Immunosuppression </td><td>23 (14.2) </td><td>40 (16.2) </td><td>.675\n</td></tr><tr><td>Obesity </td><td>27 (16.7) </td><td>3 (1.2) </td><td>&lt;.001\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Genetic Association of rs2070788 With Severe A(H1N1) pdm09 Infection Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; OR, odds ratio.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "Genotypic Distributions of rs2070788 and rs383510 in Patients With Human A(H7N9) Influenza and Healthy Controls", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF3": {"text": "", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "Acknowledgments.
