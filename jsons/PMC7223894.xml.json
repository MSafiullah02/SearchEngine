            "text": "Lassa virus (LASV) is an emerging viral pathogen belongs to the Arenaviridae family and can cause severe viral haemorrhagic fever which is known as Lassa fever, with a 20% fatality rate (Charrel and De Lamballerie 2003). Lassa fever is a viral acute zoonotic disease due to its capability to affect the highest number of people (~ 500,000) and causes 5000 annual deaths in Western Africa (Ogbu et al. 2007). Also, the people of Ghana (~ 10%), C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (~ 30), Nigeria (~ 40%), Guinea (~ 50%), Sierra- Leone and Liberia (~ 80%) and a few areas of Mali are assumed to be affected by Lassa fever (Fichet-Calvet and Rogers 2009; Safronetz et al. 2010). About 200 million people of West African regions (i.e., Nigeria and Senegal) are at high risk of LASV outbreak (Charrel and De Lamballerie 2003). Moreover, it also affects many areas of Europe such as the United Kingdom (Kitching et al. 2009), Netherlands (WHO 2000) and Germany (Haas et al. 2003). Though it has been revealed that the virus primarily targets antigen-presenting cells (mainly dendritic cells and macrophages) and endothelial cells and interferes with their complete maturation and activation, but the pathogenesis of Lassa fever is yet not clearly understood (Hallam et al. 2018; Oti 2018). Given the high annual incidence and mortality rate, however, the development of an effective LASV vaccine is an urgent necessity.",

The large or L segment of the RNA encodes the 200 kDa RNA polymerase (L) protein and the small ring-finger protein (matrix protein or Z-protein, 11 kDa) that regulate replication and transcription (Cornu and de la Torre 2001; Djavani et al. 1997). The small segments encode the surface glycoprotein precursor (GP, 75 kDa) and the nucleoprotein (NP, 63 kDa), which is proteolytically cleaved into GP1 and GP2 (envelope glycoprotein) that bind to the alpha-dystroglycan receptor and mediate entering into the host cell (Cao et al. 1998; Oti 2018).",

            "text": "LASV is transmitted to the human being through the rodent reservoir Mastomys natalensis, a typical African rat lurking in village houses (Bonner et al. 2007). Recent evidence, however, indicates that other rodent species may also be LASV recipients, like, African wood mouse Hylomyscus pamfi (Nigeria), and Guinea mouse M. erythroleucus (Nigeria and Guinea) (Hallam et al. 2018). Exchange of LASV occurs when a healthy individual comes in contact with the blood, secretion, tissue or excretion of any infected personal or by food contaminated with the host excreta. However, skin to skin contact without exchange of blood fluid cannot transmit the virus (Keenlyside et al. 1983). Children under ten years old are considered as the most vulnerable to LASV. For instance, a study showed 15% seropositivity in the under-aged population in West Africa (Kern\u00e9is et al. 2009). Besides, pregnant patients with Lassa fever results in spontaneous abortions (Price et al. 1988). Ribavirin, an antiviral drug, is found to be effective at the initial phase of Lassa fever and can reduce the fatality rate (Jahrling et al. 1980; McCormick et al. 1986). However, the development of potential toxicity and teratogenicity when used in the later stage of disease drives us to think that Ribavirin is not a potent therapeutic against Lassa fever (Fisher-Hoch et al. 1992; Kochhar 1990). Peptide vaccines are immune stimulants where fragments of virus-derived proteins mimic natural pathogens; hence, more influential in terms of safety, efficacy and specificity (Skwarczynski and Toth 2016). In 1985, the first epitope-based vaccine was developed using cholera toxin against E. coli (Jacob et al. 1985). Furthermore, peptide vaccines against many pathogenic agents (i.e., HIV, malaria, swine fever, influenza, anthrax, etc.) are promptly under development (Li et al. 2014).",

Subsequently, a vaccine was designed using the most persuasive epitopes from each protein with suitable adjuvant and linkers. The primary sequence was used for physicochemical analysis and immunogenic profiling, followed by the secondary and tertiary structure predictions. The predicted three-dimensional (3D) structure was applied for refinement and validation. Besides, disulphide bridging was done to improve structural stability. The binding affinity and interactions between the vaccine protein and the receptor were calculated by molecular docking and dynamics simulation, respectively. Codon optimization and in silico cloning were taken care of for the evaluation of the expression of chimeric protein within the appropriate host. Finally, an immune simulation was performed to estimate the immunogenic potency in real-life.",

This server predicts CTL epitopes based on three criteria, namely, MHC-I binding peptides, C-terminal cleavage, and TAP transport efficiency. MHC-I binding and C-terminal cleavage are obtained by using artificial neural networks whereas TAP transporter efficiency is evaluated by the weight matrix (Larsen et al. 2007). In this study, the threshold was set to 0.5 which has a sensitivity and specificity of 0.89 and 0.94, respectively. Furthermore, MHC-I binding alleles for each CTL epitope were predicted using the consensus method in the IEDB analysis tool (Moutaftsi et al. 2006).

So, AllergenFP v1.0 server was used for allergenicity prediction. This server can recognize both allergens and non-allergens with 88% accuracy (Dimitrov et al. 2014b). Furthermore, toxic epitopes should be eliminated as they could compromise the functionality of the vaccine construct.

High concentrations of IgM was characterized at the primary response. In both the secondary and tertiary reactions, the typical high levels of immunoglobulin activities (i.e., IgG1 + IgG2, IgM, and IgG + IgM antibodies) were evident with concomitant antigen reduction (Fig. 11a). This indicates the emergence of immune memory and thus increased antigen clearance upon subsequent exposures (Fig. 11e). Furthermore, several long-lasting B-cell isotypes were observed, suggesting the potential for isotype switching and memory formation (Fig. 11b, c). In the TH (helper) and TC (cytotoxic) cell populations with the respective memory development, a similarly elevated response was noticed (Fig. 11d\u2013f). During exposure, increased macrophage activity was demonstrated, with continuously proliferating dendritic cells (Fig. 11g, h). High levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 were also evident. Besides, a lower Simpson index (D) indicates greater diversity (Fig. 11i). Moreover, multiple exposure (n = 6) simulation as an encounter to endemic regions led to an increase of concentrations of IgG1 and decreasing IgM and IgG2 levels, while maintaining a high concentration of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, TC, and TH cell populations.

            "text": "LASV is a virus with a higher mortality rate and has the potential to bring upon catastrophe among the endemic region like West Africa. So, for developing a prevention method to fight against LASV is an obligation. Nowadays, vaccination is the most dynamic approach to improve the immunity system to fight against infectious diseases. Efficient development and manufacturing of live or attenuated vaccine, however, is expensive and can take years to complete. Nonetheless, the incorporation of excessive antigenic load in the attenuated vaccine appears not only to contribute little to the protective immune response but to complicate the state by causing allergic reactions (Li et al. 2014). Compared to traditional vaccines, multi-epitope vaccines decrease unwanted parts, which can either cause pathological immune responses or adverse effects (Zhang 2018). Increased safety, cost-effectiveness, the opportunity to rationally engineer the epitopes for increased potency and breadth, and the ability to focus immune responses on conserved epitopes also include potential benefits of epitope-based vaccines (Shey et al. 2019). For many years, researchers have sought to minimize the cost, time and side-effects of vaccine development. Different strategies are readily available at this moment for designing and developing efficient and competent new generation epitope-based vaccines depending on immunoinformatic approaches (Mar\u00eda et al. 2017; Seib et al. 2012). Researchers also used immunoinformatics methods as a tool to provide futuristic models of multi-epitope driven vaccine against Ebola virus, Hepatitis C virus, Oropouche virus, Dengue virus, etc. (Adhikari et al. 2018; Ali et al. 2017; Dash et al. 2017; Ikram et al. 2018). Knowing all the pros of multiepitope based vaccine, our first and foremost concern was to construct a vaccine which will be able to elicit a robust immune response after vaccination. Though there had been a few attempts to suggest candidates for peptide vaccine against LASV, this is the very first approach recommending a fully functional multi-peptide based vaccine that has been evaluated by in silico approaches (Faisal et al. 2017; Hossain et al. 2018; Verma et al. 2015).",

Through different servers and databases CTL, HTL and LBL epitopes were chosen as a vaccine candidate. An effective multi-epitope vaccine should be designed to include epitopes capable of producing CTL, HTL and B cells epitopes and inducing efficient reactions to a specific tumour or virus (Zhang 2018). Because of its function in inducing antibody manufacturing and mediating its effective features, we have been interested in incorporating B cell epitopes (Cooper and Nemerow 1984). Over time, however, the humoral response from memory B cells can easily be overcome by the emergence of antigens, whereas cell-mediated immunity (T-cell immunity) often leads to lifelong immunity (Bacchetta et al. 2005). CTL limits pathogen spread by identifying and destroying infected cells and by secreting unique antiviral cytokines (Garcia et al. 1999). Therefore, B and T-cell epitopes were predicted for the vaccine construct.",

            "text": "The vaccine candidates were selected from HTL, CTL and B-cell epitopes based on their antigenicity, allergenicity, immunogenicity and toxicity. Helper T-cells that release other types of cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) have the potential to overcome pro-inflammatory response and therefore reduce tissue damage. The innate immune system, B-lymphocytes, cytotoxic T cells and other immune cells are activated with the help of helper T-cells. Thus, the cytokine (i.e., IFN-\u03b3, IL-4 and IL-10) inducing ability of specific HTL epitopes were also evaluated for candidate choosing. The vaccine construction was completed after joining the CTL, HTL and B-cell epitopes with AAY, GPGPG and KK linkers, respectively. To enhance expression, folding and stabilization, linkers are implemented as an indispensable element in the development of vaccine protein (Shamriz et al. 2016). Furthermore, the OmpA agonist (GenBank ID: AFS89615.1) was used as a TLR2 adjuvant and joined to the first CTL epitope using EAAAK linker (Arai et al. 2001). When used alone, multiepitope-based vaccines are poorly immunogenic and require coupling to adjuvants (Meza et al. 2017). Adjuvants are ingredients added to vaccine formulations that affect particular immune responses to antigens, their development, stability, and longevity and are protective against infection (Lee and Nguyen 2015). Also, they gain great attention because the immune response to humoral and cell-mediated immune responses can be selectively modulated (Bonam et al. 2017). Though, the vaccine size is seemingly long as a peptide vaccine, several studies had been done where the vaccine length is even longer (Chatterjee et al. 2018; Kalita et al. 2019; Rahmani et al. 2019). Therefore, we think it won't be a problem in term of stability and expression. When assessing the vaccine construct, we observed that the non-adjuvant construct showed less antigenicity (0.624) than the adjuvant construct (0.7223) with the aid of Vaxijen server, which clearly states that the adjuvant is significant for the chimera.",
