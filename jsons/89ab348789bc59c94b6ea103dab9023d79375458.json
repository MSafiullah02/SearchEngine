The principle concerns about emergence of antiviral resistance in infl uenza viruses are loss of drug effi cacy, transmission of resistant variants, and possible increased virulence or transmissibility of resistant variants (1) . Because seasonal infl uenza is usually an acute, self-limited illness in which viral clearance occurs rapidly due to innate and adaptive host immune responses, the emergence of drug-resistant variants would be anticipated to have modest effects on clinical recovery, except perhaps in immunocompromised or immunologically na\u00efve hosts, such as young infants or during the appearance of a novel strain. In contrast to the limited impact of resistance emergence in the treated immunocompetent individual, the epidemiologic impact of resistance emergence and transmission could be considerable, including loss of both prophylactic and therapeutic activity for a particular drug, at the household, community, or perhaps global level. Infl uenza epidemiology in temperate climates is expected to provide some protection against widespread circulation of resistant variants, as viruses do not persist between epidemics but rather are re-introduced each season and new variants appear often (2, 3) .",

Indeed, the recent observations of global spread of M2 inhibitor-resistant A(H3N2) viruses, initially recognized in Asia (4, 5) , illustrates the public health consequences of antiviral resistance in infl uenza viruses and has led to changes in policies for use of this antiviral class of drugs in many countries. The more recent and unexpectedly rapid dissemination of oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) viruses highlights the unpredictability of antiviral resistance emergence and spread (6, 6a) . Antiviral resistance and its consequences are key factors that need to be considered by health authorities and governments when making decisions regarding the stockpiling of antivirals for response to pandemics or other infl uenza threats (7) , although concerns about antiviral resistance, particularly to NA inhibitors, should not dissuade countries from developing adequate antiviral inventories for pandemic response (1, 8) .",

In general, data to date indicate that mutations conferring either NA or M2 inhibitor resistance are not associated with worsened viral virulence, atypical infl uenza, or enhanced transmissibility in humans. In contrast to M2 inhibitor resistance, most but not all NA mutations conferring resistance in clinical isolates have been associated with reduced infectivity, replication, and pathogenicity in animal models of infl uenza. However, changes in other infl uenza genes segments, such as antigenic change in the hemagglutinin (HA), or perhaps compensatory mutations in the target genes may enhance viral fi tness and be associated with widespread transmission and illness. The following sections/chapters review clinical and epidemiological data on antiviral resistance for the two classes of available anti-infl uenza agents. Information from experimental animal models of infl uenza is incorporated to supplement the limited data derived from clinical studies.",

Rapid selection of drug-resistant variants was demonstrated over 30 years ago in early laboratory studies employing in vitro and in vivo passage in the presence of amantadine (9, 10) , and the study of resistance was used to determine the mechanism of antiviral action of M2 inhibitors (reviewed in (11) ). For human infl uenza viruses, resistance was shown to be due to point mutations in the M gene and corresponding single amino acid substitutions in the transmembrane region of the M2 protein (positions 26, 27, 30, 31, 34) that resulted in marked loss of phenotypic susceptibility in vitro. The clinical implications of resistance became apparent in studies during the 1980s of treated children (12) , in whom a high frequency of resistance emergence was documented, and subsequently of households and nursing homes, where transmission of drugresistant variants was implicated in failures of drug prophylaxis (13) (14) (15) . Phenotypic resistance to M2 inhibitors is high-level and generally leads to loss of antiviral activity in vivo.",

            "text": "Detection of M2 inhibitor resistance has usually relied on virus isolation from respiratory samples and susceptibility testing of virus in cell culture. Several assays have been described including plaque reduction, yield reduction, and ELISA (16) . Following phenotypic analysis, genotypic M2 inhibitor resistance has been confi rmed by nucleotide sequence analysis of the M2 gene and detection of the characteristic mutations. Genotypic detection can be accomplished quickly by the use of PCR-restriction length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the RNA extracted from respiratory samples using commercially available endonucleases for discrimination of point mutations in the M2 gene (17) . Greater sensitivity in detecting resistant clones has been described with reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction amplifi cation of the RNA followed by sequencing of multiple clones (18) . Recently the rapid pyro-sequencing technique has been shown to be a reliable, highthroughput method for detecting genotypic resistance in large numbers of community isolates (4, 5) . Following treatment, approximately 70-90% of amino acid substitutions in resistant viruses occur at position 31 and about 10% each are found at positions 27 and 30 (17) . The distribution of resistance mutations depends on infl uenza A subtype, such that Ser31Asn predominates in A(H3N2) subtype whereas Val27Ala occurs with increased frequency in A(H1N1) subtype viruses (19) . M2 proteins show considerable evolution in human and swine viruses, and the H3 and H1 subtype viruses have phylogenetically different M2 proteins (20) . This may infl uence the mutations that are more advantageous for conferring M2 inhibitor resistance. Of note, the Ser31Asn mutation has been responsible for the resistant A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) variants that have recently circulated globally (4, 5).",

            "text": "Pandemic strains, including reassortants bearing the M gene of the 1918 virus (21) , and earlier prototype epidemic viruses (13) have been susceptible to amantadine and rimantadine. Until recently, studies of community isolates of A(H3N2) viruses generally revealed low levels of primary resistance, approximately 1-3% (Table 1) . A survey of 2,017 isolates from 43 countries during 1991-1995 detected resistance in only 0.8%; of the 16 persons with resistant isolates, two were receiving drug and four others were in potential contact with drug recipients (22) . Of note, 4.5% of 198 isolates from Australia, collected between 1989 and 1995, showed resistance for unexplained reasons. Another survey of 1,813 fi eld isolates collected 1968-1999 in the United Kingdom found resistance in 1.5% (23) . Amantadine was approved of for use in Japan in 1998, and a Japanese study found resistant isolates in 3.4% of 179 children before starting antiviral treatment in the 1999-2000 season, although not in the preceding or succeeding seasons (24) . A survey of 1,096 community isolates collected over four seasons in Canada from 1998 to 2002 found that 0.7% showed resistance mutations (Li, unpublished observations). During the same period, 20% of 138 viruses isolated during nursing home outbreaks, in which amantadine was often used for control, were resistant. Resistant isolates have also been reported without known drug exposure in nursing home residents (25) . However, the incidence of resistance in fi eld isolates of A(H3N2) viruses increased dramatically in 2003 in isolates from China, perhaps related to increased use of overthe-counter amantadine after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (4, 8 (Table 1) . This unprecedented global spread of A(H3N2) viruses with a specifi c mutation (Ser31Asn) has occurred despite the absence of a sustained selective drug pressure, possibly because the resistant M gene was incorporated into effi ciently spreading HA antigenic variants, so-called \"hitch-hiking\" of a resistance marker (26) . Initial phylogenetic analyses of the M2 and other viral genes, particularly HA, suggested a common lineage of these viruses (26, 27) , but testing of greater numbers of resistant strains over several seasons has found no signature amino acid changes in the HA (28, 29) . This experience clearly indicates that this resistance mutation does not reduce transmissibility. Recently an increased frequency of resistant A(H1N1) viruses harboring this mutation, particularly in Asia, has also been recognized ( Table 1 ). The public health consequence has been to make this class of antiviral drugs unreliable for prophylaxis or treatment currently. It remains to be seen to what extent the emergence of new antigenic variants will lead to the returned circulation of susceptible viruses, but almost all A(H3N2) viruses isolated in late 2008 continued to show adamantane resistance.",

Another study employing sensitive molecular cloning detection methods found mutations conferring resistance in 80% of 15 hospitalized children during or immediately after amantadine treatment (18) . Nine (75%) of 12 children had 2-4 different resistance mutations detected in clones from a single sample, sometimes mixed with a wild-type virus.

Other reports have documented prolonged shedding of resistant variants in immunocompromised hosts with or without continued drug exposure, including one transplanted SCID child who shed resistant virus for 5 weeks and one adult leukemia patient who shed resistant virus for \u22651 week off therapy (43) . Another case report documented recovery of resistant virus >1 month after cessation of a course of amantadine, as well as shedding of mixtures of wild-type virus and variants with different resistance genotypes (44) . Heterogeneous populations of resistant variants with sequential or dual mutations have been found in several immunocompromised hosts (42, 43) . One stem cell transplant recipient shed the dually M2 inhibitor and oseltamivir-resistant virus for at least 5 months and probably over a period of 1 year (45) . The prolonged shedding of resistant variants in immunocompromised hosts is consistent with the genetic stability of such variants observed in experimental animal models (39) . However, early amantadine or rimantadine treatment in acute leukemia or hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients with drug-susceptible infl uenza A can be clinically benefi cial and was associated with a signifi cant reduction (35% versus 76%) in the risk of progression to pneumonia in one report (46).",

            "text": "Transmission of M2 inhibitor-resistant viruses is well documented in nursing home outbreaks of infl uenza A and may be manifested by a persistent or an increasing number of viruspositive patients despite amantadine prophylaxis. The recovery of the same genotype of resistant virus from multiple patients on prophylaxis or from patients or staff not receiving drug indicate ongoing transmission in this setting (15, 47) . This is particularly true with multiple isolations of a less commonly observed resistant variant, as was found with nine isolates of a Leu26Phe variant in one nursing home outbreak (47) . The frequency of instances in which amantadine or rimantadine have failed to control outbreaks because of resistance emergence is not well defi ned. In Canada amantadine was used for outbreak control in 29 infl uenza A outbreaks in chronic care facilities over 11 infl uenza seasons studied between 1989 and 2000 (48) . In 22 (76%) instances, transmission was stopped within 2-3 days, whereas the outbreak was not controlled in seven (24%) instances. Susceptibility testing found emergence of M2 inhibitor resistance in three of six outbreaks with ongoing transmission; amantadine failure was associated with simultaneous prophylactic and therapeutic use of the drug and with treatment of a higher proportion of ill persons in the facility. Continuing outbreaks due to resistant virus were associated with a higher proportion of cases in shared rooms compared to those due to susceptible virus. During the 1999-2000 season another study found that only 59% of 200 infl uenza A outbreaks were controlled by amantadine (49); four of fi ve amantadine outbreak failures were associated with circulation of susceptible virus, perhaps because of use of reduced amantadine doses in an effort to avoid side effects (50) . Such fi ndings emphasize the importance of proper isolation of treated persons and of using NAI for treatment of ill/sick persons. However, failures of rimantadine prophylaxis due to resistant virus have been observed in nursing home residents despite use of oseltamivir treatment of ill/sick residents (51) . Uncontrolled clinical experiences indicate that prophylaxis with inhaled zanamivir (47, 52) or oral oseltamivir (48, 50) are both effective in terminating such outbreaks. One controlled comparative study found that inhaled zanamivir prophylaxis was superior to oral rimantadine in protecting nursing home residents, largely because of the high frequency of M2 inhibition resistance in the nursing homes (53) . Resistant viruses have been recovered occasionally from patients receiving long-term amantadine for Parkinsonism (54) . One study during the 1998-1999 season in Japanese nursing homes detected resistant viruses by PCR-RLFP analysis in elderly residents with infl uenza-like illness in 24% of 141 PCR positive nasopharyngeal samples, over 90% of which were due to Ser31Asn substitutions (17) . Only 18% of the 34 patients with resistance detected were receiving amantadine at the time of sampling. The average frequency of resistance detection was nonsignifi cantly higher in the four homes using amantadine for therapy of ILI (28%) than in the four homes where it was used for Parkinsonism (16%). Such fi ndings indicate that patients receiving amantadine for noninfl uenza indications may serve as a source of drug-resistant virus under certain circumstances.",

In temporal relationship to increasing frequencies of M2 inhibitor resistance in Japan during the 2003-2006 seasons, amantadine treatment was (39) . As expected, amantadine administration protected against death in birds inoculated with wild-type virus but not a resistant variant. Studies with three pairs of epidemiologically linked human A(H3N2) subtype isolates, representing resistant variants with M2 substitutions at Val27Ala, Ala30Val, or Ser31Asn, found no differences in febrile responses, peak nasal viral titers, and nasal infl ammatory cell counts in experimentally infected ferrets between the resistant variants and corresponding wild-type viruses (58) . The variants retained their resistance phenotype during the short-term passage in ferrets. In an A/Udorn/307/72(H3N2) virus background, the Ser31Asn and Val27Thr mutations were associated with replication in cell culture and mice comparable to wild-type virus (59) . Studies of a laboratory virus A/WSN(H1N1) that was genetically engineered to harbor different M2 resistance mutations found that none were associated with reduced replication in cell culture or diminished virulence in mice, and several mutations, including Ser31Asn and particularly the combination of Ser31Asn with Val27Ala were associated with increased weight loss and mortality in mice compared to susceptible virus (60) . In general, it appears that M2 inhibitor-resistant human infl uenza A viruses that emerge in vivo do not differ substantially in replication ability or pathogenicity from drug-susceptible wild-type viruses.",

However, both groups had more rapid illness recovery than placebo-treated persons. Another study of infl uenza A(H3N2) illness found that rimantadinetreated children had lower frequencies and titers of detectable virus on the second day of treatment but higher values on days 6 and 7 after treatment and a mean 1-day longer period of viral shedding, principally related to the emergence of resistant variants (12) . Among rimantadine recipients, illness measures were initially improved compared to placebo, but 41% became worse on later days compared to 18% in the placebo. Rimantadine recipients with resistant virus tended to have increased illness scores on days 5 and 6 compared to those without. Although such studies do not prove that resistance emergence caused the delay in recovery, the persistence of symptoms combined with emergence of resistance could contribute to transmission of resistant virus from such persons, especially young children.",

Both oseltamivir and zanamivir have been used with apparent success in terminating ongoing institutional outbreaks in which amantadine-resistance was implicated (47, 48, 50, 52) . One unanswered clinical question is whether combined treatment with an M2 and NA inhibitor reduces the likelihood of resistance emergence to either class of drugs. In vitro studies indicate that the combination reduces this risk (61) . One small study comparing oral rimantadine monotherapy to rimantadine combined with aerosolized zanamivir in hospitalized adults found that the only M2 inhibitor-resistant variants were detected in the rimantadine monotherapy group (62) , and further studies of combination therapy are warranted in serious infections including those due to A(H5N1), when the infecting virus is known or likely to be M2 inhibitor susceptible (63, 63a) .",

Initial efforts utilizing sequential passage in cell culture to select resistant variants found that changes in either viral HA or NA could confer resistance in vitro (reviewed in (70, 71) ). The frequency and possible importance of resistance emergence during drug administration have been studied largely in the context of controlled clinical trials conducted in the late 1990s that served as the basis for approval of zanamivir and oseltamivir. Due to differences in drug binding interactions and structural differences in the enzyme active site, NA inhibitors show varying susceptibility patterns that depend on virus type and subtype (reviewed in (72, 73) ). For example, several studies found that zanamivir is on average 3-to 10-fold more potent against infl uenza B NAs than oseltamivir but somewhat less active against infl uenza A N2s (74, 75) . While the possible clinical importance of such differences is uncertain, the lower oseltamivir carboxylate susceptibility of infl uenza B relative to A NAs may have clinical consequences. Several Japanese studies have reported that oseltamivir therapy is somewhat less effective for treatment of infl uenza B compared to infl uenza A, particularly in younger children, as measured by time to defervescence and by reductions in viral titers in the upper respiratory tract (76, 77) . In contrast, inhaled zanamivir appears comparably effective in infl uenza A and B infections (78) . Zanamivir and oseltamivir have been available in many countries since 1999, but their actual extent of clinical use has been quite limited, except recently in Japan (79, 80) . Consequently, the possible epidemiologic importance of resistance emergence and transmission has received limited direct study to date.",

            "text": "Several phenotypic and genotypic assays are used to detect NA inhibitor resistance (6a). As noted above, changes in either NA or HA can result in antiviral resistance to NA inhibitors under laboratory conditions (reviewed in (70, 72) ). This relates to the functional balance between the receptor binding activity of HA and the receptor-destroying activity of NA, such that HA mutations causing decreased dependence on NA action for viral elution from cells can lead to in vitro resistance to NA inhibitors. Furthermore, both the target enzyme and inhibitors exert extra-cellular effects. Unlike the situation for M2 inhibitors, cell-culture-based assays have not been validated for detecting phenotypic resistance in clinical isolates, in part because of the differences in cellular receptor specifi city between human respiratory epithelium and most available cell culture types (reviewed in (71) ). Recent, low passage clinical isolates often appear resistant to NA inhibitors in laboratory cell lines. Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line that are stably transfected with human 2,6-sialyltransferase (SIAT1) to enhance expression of alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid and reduce that of alpha 2,3-linked ones overcome this limitation but has not been widely utilized to date (81, 82) . Based on plaque size determinations, oseltamivir susceptibility in SIAT1-MDCK cells increases and appears to correlate well with the results in enzyme inhibition assays for clinical isolates (82) . However, the levels of resistance observed in yield reduction assays with such cells may be much less than observed in enzyme inhibition assays for viruses with several clinically relevant oseltamivir resistance mutations, and some resistant variants (e.g., Arg292Lys) may not replicate suffi ciently for assay (83) . HA binding effi ciency and associated susceptibility to NA inhibitors are affected by amino acids in the receptor binding pocket, location and presence of oligosaccharide chains, and the structure of cellular receptors (84) . Changes in HA that alter binding to the \u03b12,3-linked sialic acid residues on typical MDCK cells may reduce susceptibility to NA inhibitors in vitro but not change binding to human cells expressing \u03b12,6linked residues. Consequently, HA mutations have been looked for in clinical isolates usually by comparing the sequence of pre-and posttherapy isolates and in some instances by examining changes in receptor affi nity. HA variants that have reduced receptor affi nity show cross-resistance in vitro to all NA inhibitors but in general retain susceptibility to NA inhibitors in animal models (71, 85) . Of note, altering the HA receptor binding site of a clade 1 A(H5N1) virus by reverse genetics, including switch from \u03b12,3 to \u03b12,6 specifi city, did not affect NA inhibitor susceptibility of the engineered viruses in differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells, although many receptor variants were less susceptible in MDCK and SIAT1-MDCK cells (85a) .",

Three isolates had a recognized resistance mutation (His274Tyr in H1N1; Asp198Glu and Ile222Thr in B) but other several new NA mutations were detected that might have contributed to reduced susceptibility. As these viruses were not obtained from persons taking a NA inhibitor, the results would indicate that either transmission of resistant variants was occurring from treated persons or that low level of de novo resistance occurs. Similarly, an Australian study of 532 strains collected between 1998 to 2002 (Table 4) found only one instance of apparent resistance (75) , an infl uenza B/Perth/211/2001 isolate that contained a mixed population with resistant variants harboring a Asp198Glu mutation (reported above) (96, 97) . A survey of 1,550 isolates collected worldwide in 2000-2002 reported very few outlier results and no confi rmed isolates with resistance (98) . A study in France did not fi nd changes in A(H3N2) susceptibility to either agent nor recognized resistant variants over 3 years from 2002 to 2005, although four variants with defi cient NA and resistance to both drugs in cell culture were described (99) . Surveys of community isolates in Japan, which has had the highest per capita use of oseltamivir in the world, have found low frequencies of oseltamivir-resistance in infl uenza A (79) and B (100, 101) viruses. During the 2003-2004 season 0.3% of 1,180 H3N2 isolates harbored oseltamivir resistance mutations (79) , whereas no resistance was found in infl uenza B viruses that season or in A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) isolates during the subsequent season (Table 4 ). However, 3.0% of 132 H1N1 isolates during the 2005-2006 season had the His274Tyr mutation that confers oseltamivir resistance (102) . During the 2004-2005 season 1.7% of 422 infl uenza B isolates from untreated persons showed reduced susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors; four of these persons were likely infected in the community and three through household contact (100) . These fi ndings likely indicate low-level transmission of resistant variants in the community during periods of substantial oseltamivir use.",

The unexpected high prevalence of oseltamivir resistance in A(H1N1) viruses in many parts of the world within a single season indicated effi cient person-person transmission. Available evidence indicated that selective drug pressure was not driving this phenomenon, and Japan had a notably low rate of resistant A(H1N1) viruses. Although several oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) variants belonging to clade 2B were detected globally, a predominate antigenic drift variant A/Brisbane/59/2007(H1N1) lineage, that is resistant to oseltamivir but susceptible to zanamivir and M2 inhibitors (105, 105a) emerged and continued to circulate in the southern hemisphere and subsequently northern hemispheres in 2008-2009. These viruses replicated effi ciently and caused typical infl uenza illness including severe and sometimes fatal infections (104a).

The increased oseltamivir susceptibility has been postulated to be related to amino acid changes at residues 248 and 252 surrounding the active site (111) .

While the clinical importance of such susceptibility variations is uncertain, these differences in in vitro susceptibility correspond to some extent with the dose levels of oseltamivir needed to reduce replication in murine and ferret treatment models (114) . Despite increased susceptibility of some clade 1 viruses, their virulence and rapid replication kinetics require higher oseltamivir doses to inhibit replication in animal models (112, 114, 114a, 114b) .

The resistant variants were all infl uenza A, typically detected on day 6, and were not recovered on day 10. The clinical course of oseltamivir-treated patients who shed resistant variants has not differed appreciably from those who did not shed such variants (117, 123) . Another Japanese study of mostly hospitalized children that utilized molecular techniques for detection of resistant clones found that 18% of 50 infl uenza A(H3N2)-infected children harbored viruses with NA mutations conferring resistance (124) . The viruses with NA mutations fully replaced the wild-type in three cases and co-existed with wild-type in six others; they emerged as early as on day 4 of the treatment, persisted to day 7, and appeared to be associated with more prolonged shedding. The use of weight-based dosing for children in Japan, as contrasted with unit dosing in most countries, is associated with lower drug exposure in young children and has been postulated to be a major factor in the higher frequency of resistance detected in these studies. However, a recent study found the His274Tyr mutation emerge in 3(27%) of 11 A(H1N1)-infected children receiving weight-adjusted doses (125) , although the frequencies of infl uenza A/H3N2 and B virus resistance detection were low in this trial ( Table 4 ). The higher frequency of resistance emergence in young children, likely experiencing These pediatric studies used a 2 mg/kg dose of oseltamivir that has been shown to give reduced drug exposure because of more rapid clearance in children under the age of 5 years. Insuffi cient drug exposure may have contributed to resistance emergence in these studies b This infl uenza B isolate showed 7-fold and 4-fold reduced susceptibility to zanamivir and oseltamivir, respectively and high IC50 values to oseltamivir (100). their fi rst or second infl uenza infection, may be relevant to the expected frequency of resistance during NA inhibitor use in a pandemic or outbreak due to a novel virus (124).",

During several weeks of therapy with inhaled zanamivir, one 18-month-old bone marrow transplant recipient had prolonged shedding of an infl uenza B virus, fi rst with an HA mutation (Thr198Ile) that reduced affi nity for human cell receptors and altered antigenicity and later with a dual variant that also possessed an NA catalytic site mutation (Arg152Lys) conferring 1,000fold reduction in neuraminidase susceptibility by enzyme inhibition assay (126) . Of note, the later isolate showed a tenfold increase in susceptibility to zanamivir in several cell cultures, a fi nding that demonstrates the unreliability of cell culture-based phenotypic assays. A 23-year-old male who underwent bone marrow transplantation for acute lymphocytic leukemia documented persistent infl uenza A infection of the upper respiratory tract for 18 months despite sequential courses of amantadine, oseltamivir, rimantadine, and ultimately zanamivir (45) . An infl uenza A(H1N1) isolate with dual resistance to M2 inhibitors and oseltamivir, but not zanamivir, and possessing an His274Tyr substitution in NA was documented for the last six months of his life. Several immunocompromised patients have experienced emergence of infl uenza A(H3N2) viruses harboring both Glu119Val in NA and M2 inhibitor resistance mutations, perhaps fostered by sequential antiviral therapy (127, 128) . One of these patients died with continued replication of dually resistant virus, whereas two others survived, including one who had persistent excretion of resistant virus for eight months after cessation of oseltamivir (128) . In addition, one instance of apparent failure of oseltamivir prophylaxis for infl uenza B with subsequent emergence of a resistant variant with an Asp198Asn has been reported (127) . Quasi-species of resistant and susceptible subpopulations may be present. However, the frequency of resistance emergence is undefi ned in such patients, and oseltamivir appears to be a useful therapy in most immunocompromised patients (129, 129a) . One prospective study of 38 bone marrow transplant patients with acute infl uenza treated with oseltamivir, including 12 before engraftment, reported only two episodes of pneumonia and no infl uenza-related deaths (129) . Antigen positivity was detected for 7 days or more in 8% of those treated but no resistance studies were performed. Oseltamivir is also active in an immunocompromised SCID mouse model, although resistant variants arise in some treated animals (129b) . In a study of seven bone marrow transplant patients given inhaled zanamivir, treatment was continued until excretion of virus ceased (median 15 days, range 5-44 days) (130) ; despite four presenting with evidence for lower respiratory involvement, symptoms resolved promptly and no infl uenza mortality occurred. Careful virologic monitoring of immunocompromised hosts treated with anti-infl uenza agents is warranted to document clearance of infection.",

One study during an infl uenza B epidemic in Japan provided strong epidemiologic and virologic evidence for transmission of oseltamivir-resistant variants among siblings in three households (100) . However, in contrast to M2 inhibitors, oral oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir are both effective for postexposure prophylaxis of infl uenza in household settings, whether the ill index cases are treated or not with the same drug (Table 3) .

            "text": "The reduced fi tness and replication competence of certain NA mutations appears to correlate with reduced transmissibility in animal models. One study inoculated ferrets intranasally with comparable infectious doses of a clinical isolate of wild-type infl uenza A/Sydney/5/97(H3N2) virus or its oseltamivir-resistant variant containing the Arg292Lys substitution and found that the mutant virus was associated with lower infectivity (50% versus 100%), 10-to 100-fold lower nasal viral titers, and lack of transmission to susceptible contact animals, in contrast to 100% transmission with wild-type virus (131) . One donor ferret inoculated with the Arg292Lys-containing resistant virus transmitted wildtype virus to several contacts, but it is unclear whether this resulted from reversion of the resistant variant, emergence of a wild-type subpopulation, or cross-contamination during the experiment. In contrast, similar studies with an infl uenza A(H3N2) virus possessing the Glu119Val resistance substitution found that the variant was as transmissible as the parental, wild-type virus and resulted in comparable nasal viral titers in both donor and recipient animals (132) . In guinea pigs recombinant human infl uenza A/H3N2 viruses with the Glu119Val or dual Glu119Val and Iso222Val mutations had similar infectivity as wild-type and were transmitted effi ciently by direct contact; however, in contrast to wild-type virus, the oseltamivir-resistant viruses transmitted poorly or not at all by aerosol (132a) . An infl uenza A(H1N1) harboring the His274Tyr mutation required a 100-fold higher inoculum to infect donor ferrets, but once infected, they transmitted infection to contact animals with a delay of 1-3 days compared to wild-type virus. These studies indicate that the degree of compromise in transmissibility varies with the particular NA mutation and ranges from the severely to the minimally compromised. The oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) viruses that have extensively transmitted during the 2007-2008 season remain to be studied in such models.",

            "text": "The highly conserved nature of the NA enzyme active site and the lack of circulating infl uenza strains in which NA is absent are postulated reasons that NA mutations would likely reduce the biologic fi tness of the virus (95, 117) . Detailed studies of the infectivity and virulence of clinical isolates possessing different NA mutations have been con-ducted in experimentally infected animals. Most, but not all, of these NA variants show markedly reduced enzyme activity or stability and reduced fi tness in animals compared to their drug-susceptible parents ( Table 6 ). An infl uenza B virus with an Arg152Lys mutation showed only 3-5% of the enzymatic activity of its parent and was less infectious and associated with lower nasal viral titers in infected animals (126) . Even when inoculated into ferrets at an infectious dose ratio of 60:1 (mutant:parent), the susceptible parent outgrew the mutant in the absence, but not in the presence, of zanamivir treatment. An A/Sydney/5/97(H3N2) virus containing a Arg292Lys substitution, replicated as well as a wild-type in MDCK cell culture but showed approximately 100-fold reduced infectivity and 10-to 1,000-fold lower lung viral titers in experimentally infected mice (133) . In ferrets the resistant variant was approximately 100-fold less infectious than the wild-type and was associated with signifi cantly lower nasal viral titers, nasal infl ammatory cell counts, and for lower viral inocula, febrile responses. Similarly, an A/Victoria/3/75(H3N2) variant possessing both the Arg292Lys mutation and hemagglutinin substitutions was about 10,000-fold less infectious in mice (134) . In comparison, an infl uenza A(H3N2) with the Glu119Val mutation appears to replicate to comparable levels and cause similar febrile responses compared to its respective parental viruses (132) ( Table 6) . Oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) viruses that circulated in the 2007-2008 season replicated in vitro as well as susceptible strains (134a) and caused typical infl uenza illness including complications, hospitalizations, fatalities in previously healthy and high-risk hosts (6, 104a) . Findings with clinical isolates of infl uenza A(H1N1) virus possessing the His274Tyr mutation have varied in animal model studies ( Table 6 ). One found that an A/ Texas/36/91(H1N1) variant replicated less well in MDCK cell culture and that its infectivity and/or replication were severely compromised in mice and ferrets (135) ( Table 6 ). In addition, inocula that resulted in comparable levels of replication in the upper respiratory tract were associated with reduced nasal infl ammatory cell and febrile responses in ferrets compared to the wild-type virus. In contrast, a study of an A/New Caledonia(H1N1) variant found that, although less infectious for ferrets, infected animals had similar nasal viral titers and febrile responses as those infected with the wild-type virus (132) . A laboratory virus A/WSN(H1N1) genetically engineered to posses the His274Tyr mutation was as virulent and replication competent in mice as the parental virus (104) . However, a clone from a clinical H5N1 isolate with this mutation grew less well in ferrets (>10-fold reduction in lung titers) and was less pathogenic compared to an oseltamivir susceptible clone (120) . Of note, while oseltamivir inhibited replication of the susceptible virus in the ferret model, it had no effect on replication of resistant virus. As predicted by in vitro susceptibility testing, zanamivir was inhibitory for both viruses. However, studies of another clade 1 A(H5N1) virus harboring the His274Tyr mutation found no differences in viral replication levels or lethality compared to susceptible, wild-type virus in mice (136) .",

Other NA inhibitors inhibitory for most oseltamivir-resistant variants and zanamivir dimers that have prolonged duration of antiviral effect after topical application are currently under development (143) . These may provide NA inhibitor prevention and perhaps treatment alternatives in the future.",

Ribavirin combined with a neuraminidase inhibitor exerts additive to synergistic antiviral activity in vitro (144, 145) . In mice experimentally infected with infl uenza A, the combination of orally administered ribavirin and peramivir was associated with improved survival relative to ribavirin alone but not to peramivir alone (144) . A combination of ribavirin and oseltamivir was no more effective than ribavirin alone against a lethal infl uenza A(H1N1) infection but superior to single agents against infl uenza B (146), whereas this combination showed additive effects against two highly pathogenic H5N1 infl uenza viruses in mice (114a) .

At the population level, the transmission fi tness of resistant variants is the key determinant of their impact, in addition to the frequency of resistance emergence (148, 149) . In addition to out-competing the wild-type virus in the presence of selective drug pressure, substantial transmission of resistant variants would require that their absolute transmissibility be suffi cient to enable sustained spread. During seasonal infl uenza, even high rates of oseltamivir use are predicted to not cause substantial resistance transmission in the community as long as viral fi tness is compromised (151) . When this model assumed a 10% relative transmissibility of oseltamivir-resistant variants compared to the wild-type virus, even extensive use of oseltamivir for treatment (40% coverage of ill persons) resulted in low levels of resistant variants circulating in the community after several seasons of use (151) . A closed population outbreak model predicted that the combination of antiviral treatment and prophylaxis would reduce the total number of infected persons but increase the fraction of resistant infections compared to treatment only of ill persons (149) . Some of these models have attempted to determine the importance of drug resistance emergence by making linkages between viral replication dynamics at the individual level and transmission of resistant virus in particular populations (152, 153) . Resistance emergence at the individual level depends strongly on specifi c within-host dynamics of infl uenza infections, including viral mutation rate, the fi tness costs of resistance mutations, and the effects of host immune responses and antiviral administration on replication.",

Very early antiviral treatment, particularly prophylaxis, would be predicted to reduce the risk of resistance emergence in some models (152, 153) . However, even very low rates of resistance emergence in persons receiving antiviral treatment or prophylaxis would strongly promote the spread of resistant variants in a pandemic (150) . Prophylaxis, by eliminating competition from drug-susceptible virus, might increase substantially the number of resistant cases, if resistant variants have suffi cient transmission fi tness (149, 150) . The extent of antiviral use is predicted to affect the extent of resistance transmission, in part because inhibiting the spread of drug-susceptible strains with anti viral interventions in the absence of an effective vaccine would keep a pool of susceptibles to resistant strains. Modeling predicts that when two drugs are available, allocating different drugs to cases and contacts is likely to be most effective at constraining resistance emergence (147) .

For example, in a pandemic the emergence of resistant variants that are transmissible is more likely with a higher intrinsic reproduction number (R 0 ) of the wild-type virus (152) .

Furthermore, the frequency of resistance emergence during therapy is substantially higher with M2 inhibitors than NA inhibitors and, for both classes, is higher in children than adults. Higher frequencies of antiviral resistance emergence would be expected in treatment of pandemic compared to interpandemic infl uenza. However, the recent circulation of oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) viruses in the absence of selective drug pressure highlights the uncertainty with regard to future neuraminidase inhibitor susceptibility patterns.

They remain valuable agents for prophylaxis of infl uenza A illness, providing that the circulating strain is likely to be susceptible, and are an option for treatment of oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) illnesses when zanamivir cannot be used, as with recently circulating oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) viruses. They are also an option for combined treatment with NA inhibitors in serious infections when the locally circulating strains are susceptible. This strategy also applies for A(H5N1) virus infections (63, 63a, 154) . M2 and NA inhibitors retain activity against variants resistant to the other class, although dual resistance has emerged in highly immunocompromised hosts. Consequently, NA inhibitors can be used for treatment and prevention of M2 inhibitorresistant virus infections and, when circulating strains are M2 inhibitor susceptible, vice versa. While M2 inhibitor resistance confers resistance to all drugs in this class, NA inhibitor resistance patterns vary with drug and virus type/subtype, such that zanamivir retains activity for many, including His274Tyr and Asn294Ser in N1, Glu119Val in N2, and Iso222Thr in B, but not all oseltamivir-resistant variants. Several infl uenza B (e.g., Asp198Asn, Asp198Asn, Arg152Lys) and A/ N1 (Tyr155His) mutations result in cross-resistance, and the Arg292Lys mutation in N2 causes substantially reduced zanamivir susceptibility. Zanamivir is an important alternative for prophylaxis and treatment in uncomplicated illness, especially when resistance to other available agents is suspected. However, the effectiveness of inhaled zanamivir in serious lower respiratory illness including A(H5N1) disease is uncertain, and resistance to zanamivir has also been reported rarely in community isolates of A(H1N1). These uncertainties reinforce the importance of continued monitoring of community isolates to assess whether increasing frequencies of resistance might affect drug effectiveness.",

The role of compensatory mutations in the target proteins that enhance viral fi tness are not well understood. Further data on the duration and levels of drug-resistant variants in the upper and lower respiratory tract of treated persons, in comparison to those observed in nontreated persons or in those treated with the other class of antivirals would be helpful in predicting the likelihood of transmission and whether there are differences between drug-susceptible and resistant viruses for either M2 or NA inhibitors. From a therapeutic perspective it remains to be established whether alternative dosing regimens or, especially in seriously ill persons, combinations of antivirals might be able to prevent or mitigate the frequency of resistance emergence and improve clinical outcomes. For management of individual patients, particularly seriously ill or immunocompromised hosts, the development of improved assays to rapidly detect resistant variants would enable selection of appropriate initial antivirals for treatment and therapeutic monitoring. Continued surveillance of antiviral susceptibility patterns in human and animal infl uenza viruses, especially community isolates in countries with higher antiviral use, and for resistance transmission in high-risk epidemiologic settings is needed.",

One study of higher-risk patients during the 2004-2005 season found no differences in the number of symptoms, duration of illness, or frequency of hospitalization in comparing outcomes among 80 patients with A(H3N2) illness due to M2 inhibitor-susceptible virus to 72 patients infected with resistant viruses(57). While the M gene mutations do not appear to attenuate or potentiate the virulence of human infl uenza viruses, more subtle effects on biologic fi tness cannot be excluded by studies to date. Occasionally wild-type virus replaces resistant variants after cessation of amantadine(18). As noted for some avian H7 viruses, this reversion in the absence of selective drug pressure suggests diminished replication competence of some resistant genotypes. However, the most common resistant variants with Ser31Asn have no apparent loss of replication competence or transmissibility.Animal model studies have found that mutations in the M2 protein do not appear to attenuate or potentiate the virulence of infl uenza viruses compared to wild-type virus in the absence of drug administration. Resistant variants of an avian infl uenza A/chicken/Pennsylvania/1370/83(H5N2) with position 27, 30, or 31 substitutions were comparable to drug-susceptible virus in causing mortality in experimentally infected birds, although virulence in both susceptible and resistant viruses varied",
