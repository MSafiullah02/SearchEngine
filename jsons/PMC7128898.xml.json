In these programmes, quantification of resistance is commonly used for guidance in antimicrobial use, research and education programmes, and design of intervention strategies for the control of antimicrobial resistance, and this also has a clear impact on new antimicrobial development and licensing strategies. In all these programmes, microbiologists are essential partners. It has been recommended that this experience be applied to other areas of infectious disease surveillance.",

            "text": "In the last decade, new organisational models for microbiology laboratories have emerged, due to drastic changes in healthcare systems and the emergence of microbial threats in infectious diseases. The former have been deeply analysed [11] and are related to changes in patient demographics, technical developments and changes in the workforce. In addition, the objective of healthcare cost containment has had a drastic influence on this situation [12, 13]. As a result, most microbiology laboratories have changed their organisational structures or may be required to do so in the near future. Externalisation of the microbiology assistance in central laboratories belonging to the private sector has been accomplished in some countries [14]. Also, consolidation is an attractive way for microbiology laboratory survival [14]. In some cases, routine microbiology processes such as serology or urine screening are concentrated in a core laboratory, which can provide a rapid-response at a low cost. Most of these core laboratories have emerged from biochemistry and haematology laboratories, due to the necessity of incorporating automatable processes in a rapid-response and cost-effective structure. Redundant instruments capable of multiple analyses are eliminated, and those remaining are concentrated in a core laboratory. Nowadays, core laboratories, including microbiology and immunology processes, have a horizontal organisational model (Fig. 1\n). Theoretically, with this organisation, microbiology processes are under the supervision of senior clinical microbiologists. An inherent advantage is that non-repetitive microbiology techniques can be developed in specific microbiology laboratories. This may consolidate microbiology laboratories. They can improve techniques in the field, including molecular techniques, implementing traditional microbiology-based techniques, and restoring the consultation role of the clinical microbiologist [13]. This has led to the active participation of microbiologists in nosocomial infection management. In some European countries, microbiologists are considered essential for the control of nosocomial infections. Microbiology surveillance studies, educational interventions, recommendations for the control of nosocomial infection, audits and feedback initiatives are developed with the active participation of the microbiologist.",

Rapid alert to outbreak situations may be accelerated with microbiology laboratories integrated into national and supra-national global surveillance programmes. Open cooperation with international networks has been essential for the design of control strategies. In addition, the application of new molecular diagnostic techniques and the involvement of basic research microbiology laboratories have been effective in resolving new microbiological threats (e.g., the SARS experience).",

These systems are time-consuming and do not require personnel trained in infectious diseases or infection control. Alert is commonly performed with a paper-based system and requires a prolonged period of time for response.",

They are frequently promoted to improve data quality and efficiency of collection, but they are essential for outbreak detection. In this sense, the availability of internet access permits rapid feedback and even interactive interventions for the exchange of interpretation and action plans. In the Pennsylvania experience, which covered a large population area [20], several laboratories implemented their computing systems and connected them to the regional healthcare electronic information system. Automatic reporting was found to be more effective than the conventional system, reducing the time needed for a paper-based report (median, 5 days), to a median of 1 day for an electronic report. Similar systems have now been developed in some European countries [22]. Features include the use of a flexible algorithm for daily analysis of data and presentation of signals on the internet for interpretation by health professionals. These systems are designed to complement, but not replace, conventional methods, as they receive reports from sources other than laboratories (e.g., clinician-based surveillance of notifiable diseases). Electronic/laboratory-based surveillance will allow early implementation of response and control strategies. Moreover, electronic reporting is highly sensitive and specific, with a low rate of false-positive and false-negative results.",
