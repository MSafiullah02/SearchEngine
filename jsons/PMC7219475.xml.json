Because of their fundamental nature and simplicity, two particular models have received special attention by the scientific community, the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) and the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models. In both models, an infected individual spreads the disease to its neighbors at a given (spreading) rate, and infected individuals recover at some other rate. The difference between both scenarios lies in the fact that in the SIS case, once recovered, infected individuals can catch the disease again; therefore, they go back to the susceptible state. On the contrary, in the SIR model, recovered individuals are supposed to acquire permanent immunity and do not play any active role in the spreading process anymore. There are many other variations of these two models, including more realistic and intricate compartmental models [1]. However, these two schemes are sufficient to capture the main phenomenology of disease dynamics\u2014and many other contagion-like processes\u2014including the onset of epidemics, while remaining simple.",

However, most real-world networks are heterogeneously organized, leading to the reexamination of previous results considering nontrivial patterns among individuals, such as power-law degree distributions [4\u20136]. In Ref. [7], the authors presented the heterogeneous mean-field approach (HMF), showing that the epidemic threshold tends to zero in the thermodynamic limit on scale-free networks when the characteristic exponent is less than 3. This observation about the role of network organization completely changed our previous understanding of how disease outbreaks should be modeled and controlled, placing the focus of attention not only on new ways to model disease dynamics but also on the incorporation of real contact patterns in the dynamical settings [3,8\u201311].",

For instance, instead of the HMF approach, one can adopt the quenched mean-field (QMF) method, where a specific network is fixed and the dynamics is modeled in terms of nodal probabilities [12,13]. The results obtained with the latter approach show that the epidemic threshold depends on the inverse of the leading eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix [12,13]; a similar result was also obtained using a discrete Markov chain approach [14]. Other scenarios explored recently include the case of temporal networks [15,16], competing and interacting diseases [17\u201323], as well as the inclusion of human behavioral responses [24\u201326].",

            "text": "However, the vast majority of the works so far deal with single-layered networks, despite the fact that many real systems exhibit a large degree of interconnectivity and hence should be modeled as multilayer networks [27]. Such systems represent multimodal, multicategorical, or temporal interactions, such as social relations, the ecosystem formed by different online social networks, or modern transportation systems [27]. Cozzo et al.\n[28] showed that disregarding the multilayer structure can lead to misleading conclusions, missing fundamental aspects of the critical dynamics of spreadinglike processes. Such findings reinforce the importance of a more detailed investigation of contagion processes on multilayer networks. Here, we develop a theoretical and computational framework for the analysis of disease spreading, generalizing the results of Ref. [13] to multilayer networks. A continuous counterpart to the model presented in Ref. [28] is provided in terms of the tensorial notation introduced in Ref. [29]. Our methodology allows for several new results. First, we are able to write down, in a compact form, the equations describing the disease dynamics in a multilayer system. Second, we derive the corresponding epidemic thresholds for the SIS and SIR cases, as well as establish bounds for the prevalence of the disease in the SIS scenario. More importantly for future works, we identify previously unnoticed multiple susceptibility peaks and show that there is disease localization but that it takes place on the layers instead of on the nodes of a given layer. All these findings are traced back to the very topological nature of the system and described in terms of the eigenvalue spectra of the supra-contact tensor and the localization of eigenstates.",

Furthermore, we use the results in Ref. [30] to define some constraints on the critical point. In addition, we explore the notion of localization of eigenstates, formerly applied on epidemic spreading in Ref. [31], to inspect layerwise disease localization transitions.

A tensorial representation provides a natural and concise framework for modeling and solving multidimensional problems and is widely used in different fields, from linear algebra to physics. In particular, general relativity is completely formulated under the tensorial notation. Here, we use the representation formerly presented in Ref. [29]. We also adopt the Einstein summation convention, in order to have more compact equations: If two indices are repeated, where one is a superscript and the other a subscript, then such an operation implies a summation. Aside from that, the result is a tensor whose rank lowers by 2. For instance, A\u03b2\u03b1A\u03b1\u03b3=\u2211\u03b1A\u03b2\u03b1A\u03b1\u03b3. In our notation, we use Greek letters to indicate the components of a tensor. In addition, we use a tilde (\u22c5\u02dc) to denote the components related to the layers, with dimension m, while the components without a tilde have dimension n and are related to the nodes.",

The first two processes are associated with the edges of the graph and are characterized by the parameters \u03bb and \u03b7, respectively. The latter transition is modeled in the node, also via a Poisson process with parameter \u03bc. Using the tensorial notation defined above, the equations describing the system dynamics read dX\u03b2\u03b4\u02dcdt=-\u03bcX\u03b2\u03b4\u02dc+(1-X\u03b2\u03b4\u02dc)\u03bbR\u03b2\u03b4\u02dc\u03b1\u03b3\u02dc(\u03bb,\u03b7)X\u03b1\u03b3\u02dc,(3)where the supra-contact tensor is defined as R\u03b2\u03b4\u02dc\u03b1\u03b3\u02dc(\u03bb,\u03b7)=M\u03b2\u03c3\u02dc\u03b1\u03b7\u02dcE\u03b7\u02dc\u03c3\u02dc(\u03b3\u02dc\u03b4\u02dc)\u03b4\u03b4\u02dc\u03b3\u02dc+\u03b7\u03bbM\u03b2\u03c3\u02dc\u03b1\u03b7\u02dcE\u03b7\u02dc\u03c3\u02dc(\u03b3\u02dc\u03b4\u02dc)(U\u03b4\u02dc\u03b3\u02dc-\u03b4\u03b4\u02dc\u03b3\u02dc),(4)which encodes the contacts. It has a similar role as the matrix R in Ref. [28]. Notice that we have implicitly assumed that the random variables X\u03b2\u03b4\u02dc are independent. Formally, if the state variable (Bernoulli random variable) S\u03b2\u03b4\u02dc is such that S\u03b2\u03b4\u02dc=1 when the node \u03b2 on layer \u03b4\u02dc is a spreader and S\u03b2\u03b4\u02dc=0 otherwise, then P[S\u03b2\u03b4\u02dc=1]=X\u03b2\u03b4\u02dc. In this way, the independence of random variables implies that P[S\u03b2\u03b4\u02dc=1,S\u03b1\u03b3\u02dc=1]=P[S\u03b2\u03b4\u02dc=1]P[S\u03b1\u03b3\u02dc=1]=X\u03b2\u03b4\u02dcX\u03b1\u03b3\u02dc. Cator and Van Mieghem [33] proved rigorously that the states of any two nodes in the SIS model are non-negatively correlated for all finite graphs. This result can be easily extended to our case since we are considering constant rates and Markovian processes. Because of the positive contribution of the infected nodes, we have P[S\u03b2\u03b4\u02dc=1|S\u03b1\u03b3\u02dc=1]\u2265P[S\u03b2\u03b4\u02dc=1], implying that the model is always overestimated.

Analogously to the results for monolayer systems, we have a critical point given as (\u03bc\u03bb)c=\u039b1,(6)where \u039b1 is the largest eigenvalue of R. The complete derivation of the critical point is presented in Appendix B 2. Observe that the eigenstructure of the tensor R is the same as for the matrix R in Ref.

Additionally, another possible scenario, completely different from the traditional single-layer one, is possible if we consider layerwise localization, i.e., localization on layers instead of on a fraction of nodes. In such a case, the IPR(\u039b) will be of order O(1/n) in the localized phase, whereas it will be of order O(1/nm) in the delocalized phase. This is because, in the layerwise localized phase, the components of the eigentensor are of order O(1/n) for all the nodes in the dominant layer and of order zero for nodes in other layers. Thus, one easily realizes that the correct finite-size scaling to take in order to characterize such a transition is m\u2192\u221e; i.e., the number of layers goes to infinity while the number of nodes per layer remains constant. In fact, in this limit, IPR(\u039b) will vanish on one side of the transition point while remaining finite on the other side. In this way, we can also observe localized states in the case in which there is no possibility for localization in each of the layers if they were isolated.",

On the other hand, with probability \u03bbNk/(\u03bcNi+\u03bbNk+\u03b7Nm), one infected individual, chosen with a probability proportional to its intralayer degree, spreads the disease to an incident edge chosen uniformly at random. Finally, with probability \u03b7Nm/(\u03bcNi+\u03bbNk+\u03b7Nm), one infected individual, chosen with a probability proportional to its interlayer degree, propagates the disease to an edge chosen uniformly.

The process is iterated following this set of rules, simulating the continuous process described by the SIS scenario.",

Every time the process tries to visit an absorbing state, it is substituted by an active configuration previously visited and is stored on a list with M configurations, constantly updated. With a probability pr, a random configuration on such a list is replaced by the actual configuration. In order to extract meaningful statistics from the quasistatic distribution, denoted by P\u00af(nI), where nI is the number of infected individuals, the system must be on the stationary state and a large number of samples must be extracted. In this way, we let the simulations run during a relaxation time tr and extract the distribution P\u00af(nI) during a sampling time ta. The threshold can be estimated using the modified susceptibility [11], given by \u03c7=\u27e8(nI)2\u27e9-\u27e8nI\u27e92\u27e8nI\u27e9=nm(\u27e8(\u03c1QS)2\u27e9-\u27e8\u03c1QS\u27e92\u27e8\u03c1QS\u27e9),(20)where \u03c1QS is the quasistationary distribution P\u00af(nI). As argued in Refs. [11,35], the susceptibility presents a peak at the phase transition on finite systems. Such a measure is the coefficient of variation of the temporal distribution of states over time on the steady state. Note that the magnitude of the susceptibility \u03c7 is not of primary interest to us, but rather the position of its maximum value with respect to \u03bb/\u03bc is of interest since it will coincide with the critical threshold for sufficiently large systems.",

It is noteworthy that, in spite of the similarities between our continuous model and the discrete model [28], both represent slightly different processes.

Motivated by the findings reported in the previous sections, especially by the presence of a second change in the slope of \u03c1 as observed in Figs. 2 and 3, we have performed extensive Monte Carlo simulations using the QS method, with the aim of determining, as accurately as possible, the points at which the transitions take place for a two-layer multiplex network.

Although it cannot be considered as a critical point, we have a transition from a layerwise localized state to a delocalized state.

In this mapping, we are interested in the behavior of the second layer, and we consider that the self-infection \u03b5 is determined by the contribution of the first layer by means of the contacts between nodes in different layers, which are Poisson processes with parameter \u03b7.

The initial conditions for these experiments consider that the first layer has an initial probability of a node being infected equal to 0.01, while in the second, every node spreads. Note that we chose this initial condition for visual purposes since any initial condition would result in a similar steady-state regime. In this way, during the transient state, we observe a decay of the fraction of infected individuals; then, at the metastate that configures the steady state, we observe a stochastic variation centered on the average value. In addition, such fluctuations tend to increase near a \u201ccritical point.\u201d We observe that for (\u039b11)-1>(\u03bb./\u03bc)>(\u039b21)-1 for \u03b7=10-4, the incidence is very low, of order O(1/n); however, it is larger than zero. As we increase the value of \u03bb, we drive the system to its active state, being able to sustain the disease and spreading it in the intra-edge contacts. In addition, by increasing \u03b7 we are able to increase the incidence of the disease due to the intra-edge contacts. Near the critical point of the second layer, (\u03bb/\u03bc)=(\u039b21)-1=0.833, we can observe some features that are similar to a transition. From below, we observe that the lower the value of \u03b7, the longer it takes for the system to reach the steady state, similarly to what is expected in phase transitions. On the other hand, slightly above the critical point, the time it takes to get to the steady state decreases and the curves for \u03b7=10-4 and \u03b7=10-3 get closer. This suggests that the effects of intralayer spreading are the main source of spreading. Finally, for \u03bb/\u03bc sufficiently large, we observe the same behavior for all values of \u03b7; i.e., all of them are in an active state.",

This result suggests that when the layer with the largest eigenvalue is located at the center of the line, it can effectively act as a barrier to the disease. In addition, it is verified that the extra interedges of the multiplex case do not lead to radical changes in the transition points. We remark that the susceptibility does not measure the fraction of spreaders in the steady state. Thus, despite the similarities of those curves, the phase diagrams for the incidence of the disease are different.",

Since the middle layer has the lowest individual eigenvalue among the layers, it creates a barrier effect \u201cdelaying\u201d the second transition. Moreover, we observe that this transition also vanishes for higher values of the ratio \u03b7/\u03bb, if compared to the other cases. This can be related to the inverse participation ratio of \u039b1, IPR(\u039b1), shown in Fig. 8. Note that, for the line (2.3+2.9+2.6), the contribution of the layer \u03b3=2.6 is the lowest. As shown in Sec. V A (and in Ref. [28]), for a two-layer multiplex, the critical point of the nondominant layer shifts to a lower value of the spreading rate, which means that the outbreak takes place before it would have happened if that layer were isolated. However, here such shifting is compromised by the fact that the central layer is unable to sustain the epidemic process, acting effectively as a barrier for disease contagion. Apart from this new effect, the system behaves qualitatively similarly to the two-layer scenario.",

We have also validated our analytical insights with extensive numerical simulations, recovering results like those presented in Ref. [28] regarding the shifting of the global epidemic threshold to lower values of the spreading rate and the role of the so-called dominant layer. Furthermore, we have observed a transition in the spectra of the supra-contact tensor, from the spectra resulting from the union of the individual layers to the spectra of the network of layers. This behavior implies that other dynamics and more complex structures can also be significantly affected by the interconnected nature of the system. In addition, we have analytically characterized the phenomenon of eigenvalue crossing on the supra-contact tensor for the case of two identical layers. It is worth noticing that any dynamical process that is described by the same tensor will be affected by this.",

Using the QS method and Monte Carlo simulations, we have been able to precisely determine the transition points. We remark that the first susceptibility peak is a phase transition, from a disease-free state to an endemic, but layer-localized, state. On the other hand, the second peak is a transition from a layerwise localized to a delocalized state, which is not a second-order phase transition. Additionally, we have proposed an analytical approach based on the use of the inverse participation ratio to characterize such transitions as a localization phenomenon, thus also connecting with Ref.
