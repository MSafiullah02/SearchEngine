Lung cancer has two main types, small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)2, the latter accounting for 85% of lung cancer3. Both of them have a low 5-year survival rate. In the United States, the 5-year survival rate of lung cancer is only 17.4%4, and this value is even lower in developing countries. Therefore, lung cancer is one of the most serious diseases threatening human health1.",

In our study, we confirmed that even in the same type of cancer, the expression levels can also be distinct in tumor progression. The data obtained indicated a trend that the expression level of this gene cluster first decreased in stage I-III. The lowest expression level appeared in stage II (miR-17, miR-18a, miR-19a/19b, and miR-20a) and stage III (miR-92a-1). Then, in stage IV, the expression levels of all 6 miRNAs rose to varying degrees. Among them, miR-17 and miR-20a increased sharply. We speculate that in stage I-III, the expression of the 6 miRNAs is inhibited to different degrees. In stage IV, such inhibitions are relieved.
