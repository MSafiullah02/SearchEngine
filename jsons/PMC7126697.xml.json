The initial number of infectious patients (I0) was estimated from Q0, assuming that Q0 is q% of total infectious cases (I0 + Q0).

Hence, we graphed the logarithmic scale representation to better compare the nature of growth of the epidemic in India (Fig. 3b). China shows the largest area under the curve but also shows a flattening of the slope, indicating control of spread. China had initiated stringent and wide-ranging NPI measures which resulted in the reduction of new infections, which is captured in flattening of the shape of the curve. China took the aggressive steps of complete lockdown of Wuhan starting from mid-Jan 2020 and was able to control the epidemic by 8 weeks, where estimated R dropped from 2 to 1.05.10 South Korea is the only other country among those studied, which has managed to alter its curve.

In real life, at least 50% of them need to be quarantined/isolated for the graph to reach inflection point. Considering the current rising trend, it appears that more than 50% of the infected persons in the population have not been identified at present. The reasons appear to be twofold. Unlike in the model, the infectious group is not clearly identifiable in the community, as many of them are presymptomatic/asymptomatic or with mild symptoms who do not seek medical care. There are also people with known exposure (e.g., return from foreign travel) who might not effectively submit to self-quarantine. Once community spread commences, it becomes difficult to even identify exposure. It has been estimated from early studies that 40\u201350% of infectious individuals remain asymptomatic and they are equally infectious as those who are symptomatic.13, 14, 15 Early testing of greater numbers is likely to identify more infective individuals. The ICMR cautiously has recommended an increase in the numbers to be tested.16 The only way to prevent transmission from undetected infective cases to susceptible population is to implement universal NPI measures.",
