This is true even where there is a commitment to tackling \u201cupstream\u201d determinants (Popay, Whitehead, & Hunter, 2010). To illustrate, there has been recent criticism of the Chief Medical Officer\u2019s report on child health focusing on \u201chealth-care\u201d services and \u201cindividual-level targets\u201d and its failure to suggest action on wider issues (Tillmann, Baker, Crocker-Buque, Rana, & Bouquet, 2014).",

EH practitioners are also increasingly involved in tackling other public health issues such as obesity. Rehfuess and Bartram (2014) suggest a useful definition of EH interventions: \u201cany modifications to the natural or physical environment, or behaviours relating directly to them, which are undertaken with the intention to protect or improve public health\u201d (p. 155).

There remain tensions in meeting these often narrow regulatory requirements and leading on wider public health, both in policy and practice. Rather than taking an holistic approach, EH has tended to fragment into administrative silos, including food safety, occupational health and safety, housing and environmental protection, and in what has been described as \u201caction-oriented\u201d fields (Eyles, 1997). This, coupled with the challenges of measuring the effectiveness of action on complex public health issues in the short-term (Bauld & Judge, 2008), presents difficulties in developing the evidence base required to persuade decision-makers of the legitimacy and cost-effectiveness of proactive interventions. Consequently, there has been a substantial impact on the ability to adopt an evidence-based system in EH. The development of an evidence base for tackling the social determinants of health, and an evidence base for EH are separate issues. However, they are also highly interlinked and interdependent. We therefore address them together here.",

This followed historical restructuring in 1974, when public health medicine joined the National Health Service (Byrne, 1994; Stewart, Bushell, & Habgood, 2003), leaving EH in local authorities, contributing to challenges we describe. Health and Wellbeing Boards (HWBs) went live at the same time as the restructure; these are local government led committees charged with setting the local strategic direction for health, including public health, bringing together representatives from health and local authorities. The new system has required all public health professionals, whether formerly health service or local authority based, to work more closely to improve health and well-being and tackle health inequalities in their local populations (Department of Health, 2012). However, EH practitioners do not have a secure and mandated place on HWBs and have been found to be largely \u201cinvisible\u201d to their colleagues in the wider public health system (Dhesi, 2014).",

Importantly, observers have noted that funding for health promotion activities is now linked to evidence-based practice and that \u201cthis is now the norm\u201d (Dunne, Scriven, & Furlong, 2012, p. 109).

Although hazard and risk have become increasingly factored into regulation, other issues such as a requirement to enhance social capital or community cohesion are not.
