            "text": "Preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), a common disease of prematurity, often require respiratory support. Although evidence supports the utility of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for RDS,1 there is less evidence regarding optimal timing of CPAP discontinuation.2 CPAP enables areas of the lung that participate in gas exchange to remain inflated. However, CPAP may also be associated with impaired blood return to the heart,3 pneumothoraces,4 and nasal septum injury.5 Therefore, discontinuing CPAP upon resolution or improvement of respiratory distress may minimize risks. In randomized controlled trials on approaches to CPAP discontinuation in preterm infants, up to 65% of infants fail their initial wean from CPAP.2 This high failure rate provides further confirmation that better criteria are needed to identify infants ready to wean from CPAP as periods of atelectasis that may occur with failed weaning attempts could potentially cause further lung injury.6",

These criteria have included indicators of work of breathing, parameters of respiratory support, and frequency of apneic events. The oxygen requirement in these trials has ranged from 0.21 FiO210,12 to <0.25\u201330 FiO2.9,13,14 Despite the use of these criteria, multiple trials have reported CPAP-weaning failure rates exceeding 50%.9,12,15 These failures to successfully wean infants from CPAP suggest that currently used criteria to identify infants ready to wean from CPAP are insufficient. However, weaning success may not only result from the stability criteria used to wean infants but also the failure criteria used to restart CPAP. In these trials, failure criteria ranged from any oxygen requirement10,12 to >0.60 FiO2.13 In the RCT with the failure criteria of >0.60 FiO2, the CPAP-weaning failure rate was the lowest at ~20%.

Despite respiratory support and baseline characteristics including FiO2 and respiratory support that did not differ between cases and controls, control infants achieved oxygen saturations >95% for more time compared with cases. This may suggest improved gas exchange in control infants compared with cases as infants in this study were weaned from CPAP at a median of 4 days after birth, which roughly corresponds to when RDS symptoms and signs typically resolve. Furthermore, in infants with transient to no oxygen requirement, achievement of higher saturations (95\u2013100%) compared with saturations within the limits (90\u201395%) may not be systematically monitored. Conversely, both control and case infants achieved target saturations for >85% of the time and case infants were not hypoxemic for more time compared with controls as would be expected in infants with little to no oxygen requirement. Analyzing achieved oxygen saturations may therefore provide additional, more predictive sensitivity for CPAP-weaning readiness in preterm infants compared with using other respiratory support parameters (e.g., low FiO2 requirement).",

In a previous study comparing oxygen saturation distributions prior to weaning from high flow nasal cannula or CPAP in preterm infants, infants requiring an increase in respiratory support after weaning had oxygen saturations <86% for a longer period of time compared with infants successfully weaned from positive pressure. However, gestational age significantly differed between groups.8 A study developing a histogram classification system monitored oxygen saturation stability over the course of hospitalization in preterm infants with FiO2 >21% and identified five histogram subtypes. Infants with progressively unstable histograms required more respiratory support at term corrected gestation and needed prolonged ventilator support compared with infants achieving higher oxygen saturations with stable oxygenation patterns.16 These histogram subtypes cannot be applied to infants in the present study as many infants were on 21% FiO2 prior to weaning from CPAP. We have also previously reported that systematically monitoring oxygen saturation histogram patterns in preterm infants may reduce death or severe retinopathy of prematurity.7",

A trial in preterm infants born at \u226432 weeks\u2019 PMA meeting criteria to wean from CPAP were randomized to either 2 weeks of prolonged CPAP or CPAP discontinuation. Infants exposed to prolonged CPAP had improved pulmonary mechanics compared with those infants in which CPAP was discontinued.17 In a multicenter randomized trial in infants born at <30 weeks\u2019 gestation (N = 177), infants were weaned off CPAP using three different strategies: sudden wean to room air, cycled between CPAP and room air with incremental increases in time in room air, and cycling on and off CPAP to nasal cannula. Infants weaned from CPAP to room air were exposed to fewer days on CPAP compared with other groups and had a lower rate of BPD (12.5%) when compared with infants cycled from CPAP to room air (42%) and cycled from CPAP to nasal cannula (19%). Infants cycled off CPAP also had a longer length of stay compared with infants weaned to room air.9 Although not powered to address this question, infants in the present study were weaned from CPAP on postnatal day 4 and there were no differences in BPD between infants that remained off CPAP compared with those infants exposed to additional CPAP.",
