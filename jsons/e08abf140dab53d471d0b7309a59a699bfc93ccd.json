Moreover, the last clinical study on treating inflammatory lung diseases using radiotherapy is more than 50 years old, long before modern criteria of evidence-based medicine were developed.

Yet, this paper also has some weaknesses attributable to a rather selective quoting of experimental work, most of which has been going on in Germany since the mid 1980s. Most of those in-vivo experiments were performed using animal models of painful degenerative joint diseases. Such a model was also used in the one experimental study described in Dhawan's paper. Yet, pathogenesis, disease progression and treatment response of these popular models are not necessarily good models for the per-acute interstitial inflammation observed in severe COVID-19 acute respiratory syndrome. The in-vitro studies may be more relevant as most of them concentrate on specific pathways in the complex network of molecular signaling, leading from trigger to overt disease. A consistent finding in these experiments was a bi-phasic dose response relationship with anti-inflammatory effects at doses <1 Gy (maximum 0.5 Gy) and pro-inflammatory effects at doses >1 Gy (progressing with dose). A review of results of these studies is currently being published in Strahlentherapie und",

Herrmann reported results of a large series of low dose (average 0.5 Gy) single exposure for mastitis REF?. Most important for the current discussion is the observation that 90% of the patients were cured within a few days if radiotherapy was given within 24 hours of the development of severe clinical symptoms. However, if radiotherapy was delayed for a few days or up to one week the cure rate dropped to 50% (as reported in Roedel et al.). This was a consistent observation reported by the old radiotherapists, also by Oppenheimer as quoted by Kirsch. The authors of this editorial conclude that the extensive clinical experience with single local radiation doses around 0.5Gy to the target volume in the early acute phase together with the comprehensive experimental work on the underlying mechanisms would justify compassionate use in those patients who are so ill that they are eligible for intubation and mechanical ventilation (which has an acute mortality of 20-50%), but under close supervision and centralized documentation. Both papers also address the issue of side effects. At this dose of 0.5 Gy, no acute, early normal tissue damage needs to be considered, yet Kirsch at al. discuss at length potential very late occurring normal tissue damage, in particular the induction of lung cancer in advanced age and late heart failure. They use, for their risk estimation, models and concepts developed in radiation protection for setting dose limits in occupational radiation exposure. The tabulated mortality risk estimations should be seen in the context of the recommendation of the International Commission for Radiological Protection (ICRP) not to use such risk estimations in medical exposure situations and in individuals. Dhawan et al. do not provide any numbers, only making a more cursory statement of the risk being low. It goes without saying that for none of the potentially effective pharmacological agents can any reliable estimates about life-time risks be made. Even taking the tabulated risk estimations from Kirsch et al., into account, the overall life time risk from this potentially life-saving treatment is 1 to 2 % with a lower confidence limit of 0.",
