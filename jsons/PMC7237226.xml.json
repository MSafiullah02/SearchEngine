By 10th April 2020, the pandemic (COVID-19) has infected more than one and a half million (1698881) people across the world. During the last couple of weeks a sharp surging trend (COVID-19 infection) has been recorded [1]. The community dissemination is a major cause behind this exponential growth. The substantial growth of this pandemic virus (COVID-19) has created a scary and stressful environment [2]. The consequence of the stress is so high that fear of infection forces the persons to suicide [3]. The key intention of this analysis is to highlight the escalating cases of COVID-19 and its refection in the growing search trend and concern of the people from 01st March to 10th April 2020.",
