Co-infection with HIV and hepatotropic viruses causes complex interactions (Hadler et al., 1991, McNair et al., 1992). HIV-induced impairment of the cell-mediated immunity causes higher replication of hepatotropic viruses (Benhamou et al., 1999). Additionally, HBV leads to enhanced transcription of HIV through an NF-\u03baB element in the long terminal repeat of HIV (G\u00f3mez-Gonzalo et al., 2001). More than 95% of adults spontaneously recover from an acute HBV infection (Beasley, 1988), an outcome that is defined by clearance of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) from blood. Those persistently infected with HBV are at increased risk of development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (Hsu et al., 2002). HIV-1 causes multidimensional immunosuppression, associated with reduced frequency of spontaneous recovery from HBV infection (Colin et al., 1999). The impact of co-infections on the clinical outcome of HIV-infected patients is unclear and the available treatment options against these viruses are also limited (Shlomai and Shaul, 2003).",

Specific inhibition of cellular mRNA by RNAi can be triggered in mammalian cells by the introduction of synthetic 21\u201323-nucleotide double-stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA) (Elbashir et al., 2001, Paul et al., 2002) or, alternatively, by the transcription of siRNA from a DNA construct driven by the RNA polymerase cassette (Brummelkamp et al., 2002). RNAi is initiated by degradation of single-stranded RNA of identical sequences. Therefore, RNAi approach can be used to silence gene expression by directly targeting its specific sequence of mRNA. In addition to the widely used strategies for inhibiting gene expression in research work, RNAi approach has been used in therapeutic studies of human diseases including cancer and viral infectious diseases (Cioca et al., 2003, Zhang et al., 2003, Verma et al., 2003). The RNAi approach has been reported as an ideal tool to inhibit infectious virus replication in host cells because siRNA can target and silence important genes of the virus.",

RNAi has also been used in the inhibition of replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), which causes chronic liver disease including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (Hamasaki et al., 2003, McCaffrey et al., 2003, Shlomai and Shaul, 2003, Kapadia et al., 2003). It has been demonstrated that siRNA effectively protects human cells against poliovirus infection (Gitlin et al., 2002) and that siRNA could block retroviral infection in chick embryos and inhibit the growth of the Rous sarcoma virus and HIV in cell culture (Hu et al., 2002). siRNA primarily prevented accumulation of the viral RNAs synthesized in the late stage of the infection, but did not degrade the RNA genome of the virus in the early stage of the infection. siRNA molecules generated against the HCV replicon inhibited the HCV mRNA transcripts and protein expression (Kapadia et al., 2003). It has been found that siRNA inhibited severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) gene expression and replication in cultured cells (He et al., 2003).",

In this study, we extended our study by using this system to produce simultaneously two siRNA duplexes that targeted the S gene of HBV and the gp120 gene of HIV-1, respectively. To study the effects of dual RNAi on HBV gene expression and replication in a cell culture model, we used a derivative of the human HepG2 hepatoma cell line, HepG2.2.1.5, which has been stably transformed with several copies of the HBV genome and is used as an in vitro model for HBV replication. To study the effects of dual RNAi on HIV-1 gene expression and replication in mammalian cells, we used two HIV-1 expression vector pNL4-3 and pNL4-3.luc.R-E-. pNL4-3 is an HIV-based infectious vector and upon transfection this clone directed the production of infectious virus particles in a wide variety of cells. pNL4-3.luc.R-E- is a non-infectious HIV-1 recombinant clone, in which firefly luciferase gene was inserted into the pNL4-3 nef and two frameshifts (5\u2032 Env and Vpr aa 26) rendered this clone Env\u2212 and Vpr\u2212 and allowed only a single cycle of replication to transfect HEK 293T. The effects of dual siRNA molecules on gene expression and replication of HBV and HIV-1 were investigated and discussed in this study.",

HIV-1 has a genome with 9 kb in size that contains nine genes encoding for 15 proteins (Peterlin and Luciw, 1988). The first potential target for siRNAs is the viral genomic RNA upon viral entry and uncoating. At least one report demonstrates that siRNA-mediated destruction of incoming HIV-1 can take place (Jacque et al., 2002) and some sequences of the HIV genome have been proven to be effective siRNA targeting sites.",

Therefore, we can initially select the suitable siRNA duplexes rapidly by simply analyzing the activities of luciferase. By using this approach, we have demonstrated that one of the siRNA molecules (HIVsiRNA3) had significant impact on the expression of HIV\u2013luciferase fusion gene.
