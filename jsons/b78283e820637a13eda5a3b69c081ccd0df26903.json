SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) as its cellular receptor, as do SARS-CoV and coronavirus NL63.(1) Higher ACE2 expression increases in vitro susceptibility to SARS-CoV, (3) and studies examining factors that impact ACE2 gene expression have revealed its upregulation is associated with smoking, diabetes, and hypertension, all associated with increased COVID-19 illness severity. (4) We hypothesized that one potential explanation for the unexpected observation that asthma and other allergic diseases may not be a risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease is a reduced ACE2 gene expression in airway cells and thus decreased susceptibility to infection. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether asthma and respiratory allergy are associated with reduced ACE2 expression in airway cells from three different cohorts of children and adults. In all three studies, total RNA was extracted from nasal or lower airway epithelial brush samples with RNA-sequencing performed independently for each study as previously described and provided in detail in the online supplement.(5) Differential expression of ACE2 was assessed using a weighted linear mixed effects model (limma) appropriate for RNA-seq data and empirical Bayes method.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 526, "end": 529, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 737, "end": 740, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Children at high risk for asthma based upon parental histories and living in urban neighborhoods were enrolled prenatally and followed prospectively in the Urban Environment and Childhood Asthma (URECA) cohort and 318 had nasal epithelial brushes obtained at 11 years of age.

In URECA, allergic sensitization was inversely related to ACE2 expression in nasal epithelium regardless of asthma status ( Figure 1A ). Within children with asthma, moderate allergic sensitization (fold change (FC)=0.70, p=4.2E-3) and high allergic sensitization (FC=0.54, p=6.4E-5) were associated with progressively greater reductions in ACE2 compared to children with asthma but no/minimal allergic sensitization ( Figure 1B ). ACE2 expression was also significantly inversely associated with type 2 biomarkers (Supplementary Table 1) including the number of positive allergen-specific IgE tests (beta coefficient -0.089, p=3.1E-5), total IgE (beta coefficient -0.31, p=5.1E-6), FeNO (beta coefficient -0.45, p=3.4E-3), and nasal epithelial IL13 expression (beta coefficient -0.123, p=8.6E-5).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 750, "end": 759, "text": "Figure 1A", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 1045, "end": 1054, "text": "Figure 1B", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 1156, "end": 1164, "text": "Table 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": ""}, {"text": "ACE2 expression was not significantly correlated with peripheral blood eosinophils (beta coefficient -0.13, p=0.07).

An additional cohort of 23 adult participants with mild asthma, not treated with asthma controller therapy, underwent segmental allergen bronchoprovocation to dust mite, ragweed, or cat, as previously described. 2) Here, we report that respiratory allergy and controlled allergen exposures are each associated with significant reductions in ACE2 expression. ACE2 expression was lowest in those with both high levels of allergic sensitization and asthma. Importantly, non-atopic asthma was not associated with reduced ACE2 expression. Given that ACE2 serves as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, our findings suggest a potential mechanism of reduced COVID-19 severity in patients with respiratory allergies. However, it is likely that additional factors beyond ACE2 expression modulate the response to COVID-19 in allergic individuals, and elucidation of these factors may also provide important insights into COVID-19 disease pathogenesis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Strengths of our study include carefully phenotyped cohorts of children and adults. Further, the allergen challenge studies included both upper and lower airway samples, with each demonstrating a consistent impact on ACE2 expression. Limitations include lack of clinical information to directly link ACE2 expression to SARS-CoV-2 infection and illness severity in our study populations. In addition, we do not have data on the ACE2 protein levels to confirm the gene expression data, though previous work suggests a direct association between ACE2 mRNA levels and ACE2 protein levels in the lung. (8) It is important to note that early data in the US suggest a higher rate of asthma in patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19 illness, but do not specify whether asthma was allergic or not, an important differentiation that relates to our findings, nor the potential presence of other co-morbidities, such as obesity, that have been identified as risk factors for COVID-19 illness. In all three studies, total RNA was extracted from epithelial brush samples preserved in RLT buffer (Qiagen, MD, USA). Samples were thawed, vortexed, and quick-spun, and the supernatant transferred to fresh tubes. The samples were then spun through a Qiashredder column (Qiagen) and extracted using RNeasy mini kits (Qiagen) with 25 ul elution volumes following the manufacturer's protocol. In the cat allergy upper airway challenge study, sequencing libraries were constructed from total RNA using TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kits v2 (Illumina). In the URECA and adult asthma studies, sequencing libraries were constructed from total RNA using SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit (Takara). For each study, libraries were clustered onto a flowcell using a cBOT amplification system with a HiSeq SR v4 Cluster Kit (Illumina).
