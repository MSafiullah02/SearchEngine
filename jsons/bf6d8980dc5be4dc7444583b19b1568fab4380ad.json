Furthermore, the macromolecular and polyanionic nature reduces interaction and uptake across the cellular membrane required for recruitment into the intracellular RNAi machinery. Improvements in both extracellular and intracellular delivery are key to the therapeutic success of RNAi therapeutics. Chemical modi fi cation [ 5 ] , conjugation [ 6 ] and incorporation into nanoparticle-based delivery systems [ 7, 8 ] are common strategies that have been employed to maximise delivery [ 9, 10 ] .",

The mucus layer thickness determines the accessibility to the underlying epithelium and depends on both luminal conditions and functional requirements of the underlying tissue. The layer thickness varies along the human gastrointestinal tract with the thickest layer in the stomach (~50-450 m m) [ 19 ] and in the colon [ 20 ] . In the eyes, the thickness of the mucus layer has been reported to be 30-40 m m [ 21, 22 ] , in the airway 7-30 m m [23] [24] [25] and in the bronchiole ~55 m m [ 26 ] . The most accessible mucosal surfaces are found in the nasal region [ 27 ] due to a very thin layer of mucus, and in the deep lung where the epithelial lining is devoid of mucus and instead contains surfactants which reduces the surface tension and potentiates gas transfer in the alveoli [ 28 ] . Relevant to mucosal therapeutic delivery is the thickness and integrity of the mucus layer may be compromised under various pathological conditions. For example increase in mucus thickness has been observed in asthma [ 29 ] , cystic fi brosis [ 26 ] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ 30 ] , whilst a decrease in thickness has been observed in ulcerative colitis [ 20 ] . This variation in mucus thickness can lead to a predisposition for disease or be induced by pathological consequences of the disease such as loss of epithelial integrity as seen in ulcerative colitis.",

Mucus constituents such as the glycoproteins (mucins), cellular debris and lipids form a heterogeneous environment through which drugs and/or drug carriers need to diffuse to reach their target [ 38 ] . Glycosylated domains of the mucin fi bres possess a negative charge under physiological conditions, and hence mucus selectively controls the diffusion of particles not only through particle physical parameters such as size, but also by their chemical surface properties. Based on the net negative charge of mucins, one could speculate that naked siRNA might be repelled by the mucin fi bres. Multivalent interactions between particles and the mucus network are main determinants of particle diffusion. Both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions occur, and the possibility of making large numbers of non-speci fi c hydrophobic interactions together with the more thermal stable electrostatic interactions enables mucus to trap particles. Several studies have demonstrated the ef fi cacy of hydrophobic interactions to immobilise particles within mucus [38] [39] [40] [41] and Ribbeck and co-workers have shown that particle surface charge, density and pH of mucin hydrogels can alter particle diffusion [ 42 ] . Particles with a PEGylated surface possessing a neutral charge had a greater diffusion rate compared to its negative or positive charged counterpart [ 42 ] . Two approaches govern the design of particles for mucosal delivery (1) the mucoadhesive and (2) mucus penetrative approach.",

            "text": "Regarding the mucoadhesive strategy, much attention has been given to the design of particles which associate with the mucus barrier and hence lower the clearance rate. The essence of this strategy lies with the previously mentioned bilayered structure of mucus. Association of particles with the lower undisturbed layer will avoid clearance and enhance the bioavailability of the bioactive entity. Another positive effect from mucus association is increased viscosity due to greater cross-linking of mucus fi bres, which in turn may lower the clearance rate. Materials of choice have been the so-called mucoadhesive materials. A common characteristic of these materials is their adherence to mucus through various forces. A widely used mucoadhesive polymer is chitosan [ 43 ] , which have been utilised to form particles with siRNA and exhibit mucosal silencing [ 7 ] . Thiolation of polymers have been shown to enhance mucus interaction through formation of disul fi de linkages with mucins [ 44 ] and various thiolated chitosan's have been synthesised [ 45, 46 ] . Not only does the mucoadhesiveness prolong the bioavailability of particles at mucosal surfaces, but it can also alter the structure of mucus so that it becomes more permeable to siRNA-loaded particles [ 47 ] . As an alternative, mucus-penetrating particle with limited interaction with mucus and increased diffusion rates is an exciting approach. Coating with PEG has been demonstrated to mediate such surface properties on latex particles (200-500 nm) [ 48 ] and nanoparticles composed of a biodegradable di-block copolymer of poly (sebacic acid) and PEG [ 49 ] . It has been further shown that both molecular weight and degree of surface coverage determined the mobility of the coated particles [ 50 ] . Reports, however, have previously classi fi ed PEG as a mucoadhesive polymer [51] [52] [53] . As speculated by Lai et al. the contradicting reports might be attributable to variations in type of PEGylation used, but the use of PEG-coated particles have yet to demonstrate intracellular delivery of nucleic acids to the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract. Interestingly, the design of mucus-penetrating particles builds on lessons learned from nature where viruses with an equal surface density of positive and negative charges readily penetrate mucus barriers [ 54 ] . Thus, surface chemistry together with size appear to be determining factors for mucus penetration and evidence points towards neutral surfaces for effective diffusion.",

Delivery of siRNA to the lungs, whether naked or incorporated in a particle, needs to address the branching of airways and the mucus layer covering the conducting segments. Ciliated cells are abundant in the nasal cavity and trachea, with apical cilia working in coordinated sweeps to transport mucus along with trapped material towards the oesophagus. The constant removal of mucus by the ciliated cells, termed the \"mucociliary escalator\" plays a critical role in preventing inhaled particulates and pathogens from residing within the trachea and the upper bronchiolar tree. The respiratory mucus consists of an outer luminal layer and an inner layer (termed periciliary liquid) in direct contact with the cilia. Under normal physiological conditions, the luminal mucus layer is refreshed every 10-20 min, whereas renewal of the underlying layer is cleared much slower [ 38 ] .

By RACE analysis of the ALN-RSV01 cleavage product, it was also con fi rmed that the reduction of the viral titre was in fact an RNAi-mediated effect [ 76 ] . Recently, the results from an Alnylam phase II clinical trial was published showing a 38% reduction of experimentally RSV infected test subjects receiving ALN-RSV01 (150 mg) compared to subjects receiving a placebo [ 14 ] . A nasal spray was used to deliver the PBS/ALN-RSV01 solution. As mentioned by the authors of the report, the induced RSV infection in the study resulted in a mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness in the region the nasal spray is likely to reach. Studies are currently underway to evaluate the effect of ALN-RSV01 in naturally infected patients, and these are likely to use aerosolised delivery methods in order to reach both the upper and lower respiratory segments simultaneously. The success achieved in studies using non-formulated siRNA is unexpected when one considers the polyionic nature of the siRNA molecule that restricts cellular uptake. A possible explanation could be loss of epithelial integrity due to infection that might allow entry of naked siRNA. Nonetheless, at the time of writing, the Alnylam RSV programme is one of the most advanced RNAi clinical trial programmes and the simplistic naked siRNA approach could ful fi l the clinical requirement of cost-effectiveness. Whilst direct administration of naked siRNA to the mucosa has been extensively used, the susceptibility of the duplex to serum nucleases makes intravenous (i.v.) delivery less attractive. Modi fi cation of the siRNA backbone, however, is now standard to reduce serum degradation [ 77 ] . In a recent study, serum stability and silencing of enhanced green fl uorescent protein (EGFP) in the bronchoepithelium of mice have been demonstrated after i.v. administration of naked LNA modi fi ed siRNAs [ 66 ] . Intravenous injections of naked LNA modi fi ed siRNA ( fi ve doses of 50 m g siRNA) resulted in comparable reduction of EGFP (55% reduction) in the bronchoepithelium as animals dosed intranasally with chitosan/siRNA particles (single 30 m g dose). Naked modi fi ed siRNA was less effective after intranasal dosing. The authors suggest that the success of the naked modi fi ed siRNA to reach the lung epithelium after i.v. injection might result from increased serum stability, allowing for longer circulation time compared to unmodi fi ed siRNAs.",

The cationic glucosamine component facilitates mucoadhesion, mucopermeation and polyplex formation. It is involved in transient opening of epithelial tight junctions improving paracellular drug transport [ 80, 81 ] . Moreover, it adheres to the mucus layer by interaction with sialic acid in mucus glycoproteins that increases viscosity, leading to decreased mucociliary clearance and prolonged residence time [ 43, 82 ] . The cationic amine has been utilised for entropy-driven formation of sub-micron particles with polyanionic DNA [ 83 ] and siRNA [ 84 ] . Chitosan has demonstrated excellent transfection abilities and several in vivo studies have revealed the ability of chitosan to enhance respiratory delivery of siRNAs and DNA. A study by K\u00f6ping-H\u00f6gg\u00e5rd et al. achieved expression of b -galactosidase after intratracheal delivery of chitosan/DNA polyplexes [ 85 ] and another study managed to partly immunise mice from RSV by intranasal application of chitosan/DNA particles coding for RSV epitopes [ 86 ] .",

Hitherto , PEI interactions and effects on mucus have not been studied in detail. Two recent studies have demonstrated pulmonary EGFP silencing in transgenic mice. Using intratracheal administration of PEG-PEI/siRNA polyplexes, Merkel et al. showed a 42% reduction of EGFP expression compared to luciferase siRNA control (single 50 m g siRNA dose) [ 57 ] . Moderate in fl ammation was seen by analysis of cytokine levels, but no histological abnormality was observed. Beyerle et al. used a fatty acid modi fi ed PEG-PEI/siRNA polyplex to achieve a 69% reduction of EGFP expression compared to untreated controls (35 m g single dose) [ 70 ] . As in the previous study by Merkel et al., PEGylation increased in fl ammation, whilst at the same time also decreased cytotoxicity. These fi ndings seem to contradict the usual perception that PEG limits interaction with the immune system. Whilst PEGylated PEG-PEI polymers appear less cytotoxic than non-modi fi ed PEI [ 104 ] , they and the fatty acid modi fi ed PEI may have a higher proin fl ammatory potential that is of concern in a clinical setting.

In a mouse in fl uenza model, the animals received hydrodynamic injections (3.78 nmol) of naked siRNA followed 16-24 h later by intranasal delivered oligofectamine/siRNA (1.51 nmol) complexes against the viral nucleoprotein and acidic polymerase to reduce viral titres in the lung (63-fold compared to EGFP siRNA) [ 71 ] .

However, if particles become too small, they are prone to being exhaled before depositing. This means solid nanoparticles, per de fi nition, are in principle too small to be effectively deposited in the lungs, and a large portion of these particles may end up leaving the lung again after inhalation. There are two solutions to this problem. Either the particles are kept in solution or they are attached to a carrier formulation which will facilitate deposition at the required depth. Nanoparticles such as those consisting of polymers and siRNAs are formed in solution, but subsequent drying by either spray drying [ 107 ] or freeze drying [ 108 ] can produce particles retaining their silencing ability which in terms of storage and stability of a therapeutic agent might be preferable compared to a solution-based formulation.",

The level of uptake is thought to be low, although penetration enhancers may potentiate paracellular delivery. An important consideration is delivery and breakdown in the liver due to the fi rst-pass effect commonly encountered by absorbed drugs. An alternative route through the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) has been exploited for the delivery of micro and nanoparticles [119] [120] [121] [122] . The overlying follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) contains specialised cells termed M-cells [ 115 ] that are anatomically designed to sample luminal particles as part of the mucosal immune response. The lymphoid follicle domes are highly populated with macrophages, which have been shown to capture material. Systemic dissemination of these macrophages has been proposed as a mechanism of transport to peripheral tissue. Although particle transport through M-cells may be augmented by increasing particle-surface hydrophobicity or attachment of speci fi c targeting ligands [ 123, 124 ] , it is important to bear in mind when utilising this route for intestinal absorption that GALT only constitutes a small fraction of the GI tract, with the numbers deceasing with age. Recent attention has focused on transport across the epithelial barrier directly mediated by dendritic cells [ 125 ] . These phagocytic cells, widespread throughout the epithelia, have been shown to disrupt tight junction and sample luminal content through the projection of dendrites, providing an exciting opportunity for the design of oral vaccines.",

In this study, porous b -1, 3d -glucan shells were loaded with siRNA targeting expression of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a ) or mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 (Map4k4) in mice. The internal element of the 2-4 m m particles contained a tRNA-core coated with consecutive layers of PEI and siRNA. Daily particle administration (~0.4 m g siRNA/ dose) by oral gavage over an 8-day period resulted in reduced mRNA levels of Map4k4 (~60-70%) or TNF-a (~40-60%) in peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) compared to animals receiving scrambled-siRNA containing particles. Map4k4 downregulation elicited a concomitant reduction in TNF-a expression that suggests a role for Map4k4-mediated control of TNF-a . In addition extended knockdown duration of ~8 days was observed after the fi nal dose. Interestingly, the authors proposed that siRNA release from the glucan shell was triggered by the acidic environment in phagosomes; this, however, could compromise particle integrity at low pH within the GI tract. Notably, no unspeci fi c interferon-g response was detected even though non-modi fi ed siRNA was used. Map4k4 and TNF-a silencing in macrophageenriched cells isolated from spleen, liver and lung tissues was observed ascribed to particle uptake across GALT and subsequent dissemination in migrating macrophages. No direct evidence for M-cell uptake or adsorption levels was provided; however, this study does suggest the possibility for systemic silencing via the oral route.",

IBD encompass a group of complex autoimmune diseases, which are broadly categorised as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis found in the small intestine and colon respectively. An attractive pathological condition that could be exploited for improved siRNA-based therapeutic delivery is mucosa integrity loss in IBD. Despite the numerous targets investigated that includes IL-12, IL-23, IL-17 and IL6 [ 127 ] , the current biologic treatment of IBD is based on anti-TNF-a molecules [ 128 ] . TNF-a has been the preferred target for oral-based siRNA therapies in two recent studies employing orally delivered siRNA for the prevention/ treatment of dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis in mice. In the fi rst of these studies, Wilson et al. [ 89 ] used thioketal (poly-1, 4-phenyleneacetone dimethylene thioketal) nanoparticles (TKNs) designed for triggered anti-TNF-a siRNA release in response to raised levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) common to in fl amed regions. A tenfold speci fi c decrease in colonic mRNA levels of TNF-a and other proin fl ammatory cytokines (IFN-g , IL-6 and IL-1) was detected after oral administration of anti-TNF-a TKNs (~46 m g siRNA/dose) over 5 consecutive days during colitis induction. Furthermore, the authors also demonstrated by histological and weight analysis that a ten times lower siRNA dose (~4.6 m g siRNA/dose) was suf fi cient to protect mice from DSS-induced colitis.",

Interestingly, this protection could not be replicated if a too high siRNA dose (~135 m g) was employed, a matter that requires further investigation. In contrast, targeting of nectin-1, the receptor used by HSV-2 to penetrate in the cells, conferred protection only when administrated 1-7 days prior, but not immediately before or after the HSV-2 challenge. Treatment of the mice with two doses (~27 m g/ dose) of Chol-siRNA combining the targeting of nectin-1 and viral genes provided signi fi cant protection for 1 week irrespective of the time of challenge.",

Upon exposure to sodium ions, a common element of cells and body fl uids, scaffold degradation occurs, resulting in the slow release of incorporated PEGylated lipoplexes. PEGylated, but not conventional, liposomes were capable of mucosal diffusion and induce siRNAmediated gene knockdown at the vaginal epithelium. Intra-vaginal administration of the scaffold over 2 consecutive days (daily dose of 8 m g/animal) resulted in an 85% knockdown of lamin A/C mRNA.

The observed protection is probably due to the combination of selective gene knockdown by the siRNAs ( CCR5 , gag and vif ) and a viral-aptamer competition for CD4 receptor binding.

The relative ease of access to surfaces common to pathogen, cancer and in fl ammatory disease promotes their use. Local delivery avoids the necessity to install \"stealth\" characteristics required for systemic delivery that reduces the complexity of design that has manufacturing, cost and clinical approval bene fi ts. The restricted entry, however, encountered by macromolecules across mucosal barriers still requires delivery strategies to improve penetration. In this context, nanoparticles rather than naked forms seem the most promising. Research to identify surface characteristics that promote mucus penetration including hydrophilic coats is set to continue, whilst coatings that mimic pathogens evolved to penetrate the mucosa is an interesting approach. Detailed studies of nanoparticle penetration in mucus and changes in the mucus morphology in response to mucopenetrative materials are a future trend. Variations in mucus characteristics at different sites and disease states are an important consideration in the design of the delivery strategy. The polyplex systems composed of siRNA and cationic polymers such as chitosan could proceed rapidly into clinical trials due to their simplistic design and mucoadhesive and mucopermeable properties. A current trend is to identify new biopolymers to improve mucosal delivery and expand the selection of available materials.",

The development of bioresponsive particles or coatings composed of pH-sensitive materials, employed for other drug types, will offer the possibility for localised site-speci fi c delivery utilising the differing pH found throughout the GI tract. The necessity for particle disassembly needed for siRNA incorporation into the cellular RNAi machinery calls for intracellular release mechanisms [ 131, 132 ] .

Proin fl ammatory responses are highly detrimental, particularly in in fl ammatory disorders. The endocytic pathway undertaken by particles can increase delivery into a TLR-rich environment that can inadvertently potentiate the response. Fortunately, these TLRdependent (through TLR-3, -7 and -8 signalling) or independent (through RIG-1 and PKR activation) adverse side effects can be avoided by siRNA structure and sequence modi fi cation such as 2 \u00a2 -O -methyl substitutions. Induction of non-speci fi c immune responses is particularly pertinent in the mucosal immune system rich in immunocompetent sites evolved to recognise and protect against foreign luminal material.
