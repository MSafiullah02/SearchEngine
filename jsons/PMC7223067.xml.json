The endotracheal tube has a cuff which must be inflated to seal the airway and prevent leaks and secretion aspiration. It is important to maintain the pressure of the ETT cuff within a range of 15\u201325 mmHg (or 20\u201330 cm H2O) [2, 3]. Too low ETT cuff pressure increases risk of ventilator associated pneumonia whereas too high pressure may lead to damaging the tracheal tissue [2, 3]. In 2018\u20132019, the journal published three papers on ETT cuff pressure monitoring covering reliability of ETT cuff pressure assessment by palpation using a regular and an alternate pilot balloon, the effect of a training seminar on the palpation technique and reliability of ETT cuff pressure gauges.",

[4] studied the reliability of detecting ETT cuff overinflation by the finger palpation technique, where a pilot balloon connected to the cuff is used to assess cuff inflation state. In a simulated trachea test setup, 41 experienced and 21 resident anesthetists were asked to classify cuff pressure as too much, adequate or too low in three scenarios; using a normal pilot balloon at significantly overinflated state (88 mmHg, 120 cm H2O), using a larger pilot balloon at same overinflation, and the large balloon at less significant overinflation (40 mmHg, 54 cm H2O). Only 35% of participants detected considerable overinflation using a normal balloon versus 87% using the larger balloon with answers being significantly different (P < 0.0001) and only answers using the larger balloon being significantly different from answers at random, regardless of seniority (P \u2264 0.0001). An overall of 32% were able to detect too much inflation using a larger balloon at the less overinflated state, with less experienced anesthetist performing worse than random (P = 0.0043). The authors concluded that whilst the results show a greater reliability of the palpation technique using a larger balloon, the larger balloon could not increase reliability of the technique to a clinically satisfactory level.",

The authors compared cuff pressure measurements in 100 patients 1 week prior to with measurements in 100 patients one week following a training seminar. Assistant anesthesiologists were in charge of ETT cuff inflation in both groups, and all attended the same 30 min training seminar. They were blinded as they were unaware of the study being performed. Following training measured ETT cuff pressures were significantly lower at median (IQR) 32 (15) cm H2O compared to 48 (30) cm H2O measured prior to the seminar (P < 0.001). The two patient groups did not differ significantly in terms of age, gender, or tube diameters (P > 0.05). ETT cuff pressure did not differ significantly between assistant anesthesiologists of different seniority. The authors argued that frequent training activities and reminders will ensure optimal cuff pressure, but also that the observed high ETT cuff pressures in their study suggest that ETT cuff pressure should be monitored, preferably with objective measurements. It will be interesting to see if future studies can demonstrate a training effect beyond the 1 week studied by \u00d6zcan et al.",

[6] studied reliability of 27 pressure gauges from 3 manufacturers (Mallinckrodt, Covidien and Portex) that were used daily in operating rooms at their hospital. Pressure gauges were tested against a pressure gauge calibrator, each device evaluated at seven pressure levels between 0 and 50 cm H2O. Only 30% of gauges fulfilled homologation criteria consisting of passing a leak test and a pressure gauge and calibrator difference < 1.3 cm H2O in cuff pressures of 20\u201330 cm H2O. The authors concluded that there was a problem with reliability and follow-up in the pressure gauges they had tested at their hospital leading them to suggest that regular and mandatory follow-up of pressure gauges should be performed and that future studies should investigate how cuff pressure gauges are monitored. Whilst intermittent ETT pressure monitoring with pressure gauges may be preferred to finger palpation, options for automatic continuous regulation also exist and some data have been reported on the effectiveness of such solutions [for review see 3].",

The wrist mounted device uses a nasal cannula to detect both snoring and nasal air flow and a finger sensor for photoplethysmography (PPG). The primary measure used for comparison of the devices was a computed Apnea/Hypopnea Index (AHI) (respiratory events per hour) based on standard flow/oxygen saturation based apnea and hypopnea criteria. Central and obstructive events were distinguished using a thoracic strap in the lab system and in the wrist system by analysis of the PPG fluctuations related to changes in intrathoracic pressure [8]. For the 48 patients studied, a good correlation (r2 = 0.723) and mean difference of 3.1 between the AHI from the two systems was found. The system described in this paper is now one of many non-laboratory diagnostic systems for apnea on the market [9] with the majority intended for home based sleep testing (i.e. Type 3 and 4 sleep tests [10]).",

[11] assessed the ability of thermal images of the patient\u2019s face, specifically the region around the nostrils, as recorded by an infra-red camera (IRT) to detect apnea in 20 patients undergoing spinal anesthesia during endoscopic urological surgery. Thermal images of fluctuations in the region around the nostrils during the respiratory cycle were measured at a 10 frames/s. Respiratory waveforms were extracted from these regions near the nostrils caused by respiration. Frame to frame feature tracking using the nose as an anchor point was required to align and correct for movements of the head. Respiratory rate (RR) determined via the IRT as compared to RR from a bioimpedance based respiratory volume monitor (RVM) showed a good correlation (r2 = 0.75). Additionally, the speed relative to the RVM that IRT can detect the changes in respiration was assessed with the authors reporting that IRT detected changes 40 s earlier than RVM, although the authors suggested that this comparison could be problematic and related to the averaging window used for RR. Technologies suited for non-contact respiratory monitoring such as infrared imaging and others such as ultrawide band radar are increasingly being explored for use in clinical and nonclinical environments (e.g. home and auto) where patient comfort and mobility are paramount [12, 13].",

Patients who received anesthesia for intraperitoneal surgery were studied and the rate of low minute ventilation events (LMVe) during recovery determined. LMVe was measured using a non-invasive bioimpedance respiratory volume monitor (ExSpiron 1 Xi, Respiratory Motion Inc., Waltham, MA) which was calibrated using the current minute ventilation (MV) value from the anesthesia machine. An LMVe was considered to occur if MV is less than 40% of the body surface area predicted minute ventilation and sustained for at least 2 min. In the 107 patients studied 36% had at least one LMVe with the LMVe\u2019s occurring with a median of 6 episodes per patient and median duration of 4.2 min. The authors also examined the utility of using low RR, defined as RR < 8 breaths/min, to detect respiratory depression and noted in these patients it was not useful for detecting respiratory depression having missed 88.2% of all low MV(< 40% of predicted MV) events. Patients receiving opioids during recovery were assessed for opioid induced respiratory depression (OIRD), defined as an LMVe occurring within 30 min of the first PACU administration of the opioid. OIRD was reported in 27 of the 45 patients receiving opioids. The authors highlighted the association of LMVe\u2019s and opioids in the PACU in patients with pre-existing mild respiratory depression which was defined as MV < 70% predicted and found to be the best predictor of OIRD of the measures assessed. This study lends further support to the notion that respiratory rate alone may not be adequate to assess and identify respiratory depression in patients in the PACU [17].",

The custom-built device and Resmon Pro Diary gave similar values for reactance, as did the tremoFlo C-100 and Jaeger Masterscope CT IOS with other pairwise comparisons being different (P < 0.05). An in vitro test in two test standards showed no difference between devices (P > 0.05) with deviations from theoretical values < 2% for resistance and < 5% for reactance. The authors concluded that the observed in vivo differences between device measurements in their study highlight the need for validation procedures taking into account breathing pattern or volume changes which is neglected by current methods.",

Becher et al. [20] described a method for calculating Crs during pressure support mode from volume changes induced by repeated small changes in pressure. They prospectively evaluated the method in 20 patients. Measurements using the new method in pressure support ventilation were compared to reference measurements obtained in the same patients during volume control ventilation without spontaneous efforts. The authors found good correlation between the new method and reference measurements but with relatively high bias of \u2212 7 ml/cm H2O and broad 95% limits of agreement of \u2212 16.7 to + 2.7 ml/cm H2O. Analysis of the last 20% of the reference measurements yielded smaller bias but broader limits of agreement. The authors concluded that the new method may, despite limited accuracy, be useful for non-invasive Crs monitoring during pressure support ventilation. As recognised by the authors, routine application would require automation and ventilator integration of the 10\u201315 changes in pressure support performed manually in their study.",

SI measurement requires device and software which is not readily available for all ventilators. Wongsurakiat et al.

Visual inspection by two physicians were compared with measurements by dedicated software in 30 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) at peak inspiratory flows of 60 and 40 l/min. Overall sensitivity of visual inspection to identify breathing as either tidal recruitment (SI < 0.9), noninjurious ventilation (0.9 \u2264 SI \u2264 1.5) or tidal overdistension (SI > 1.05) was higher for peak inspiratory flow of 40 vs 60 l/min (75% vs. 50%; P = 0.005). Experience of physicians did not affect sensitivity significantly. The authors concluded that SI estimation by visual inspection was moderately accurate and could be used in conjunction with the more widely available plateau pressure for monitoring of lung mechanics in ARDS patients.",

The method comprises of switching off nasal O2 flow temporarily to analyse FETO2 from the first three washout breaths to extrapolate backwards and estimate the enhanced FETO2 during administration of nasal O2 flow. Eighteen breath washout conditions were evaluated using a bench setup consisting of an upper airway replica and a test lung connected to a ventilator. Bias and 95% limits of agreement between calculated and observed FETO2 were \u2212 0.016 and \u2212 0.048 to 0.016, respectively.

The standard bite block required the use and placement of separate catheters for nasal and oral gas sampling and nasal oxygen delivery while the mandibular bite block provided a connection port for oxygen that distributed it to both the oral and nasal cavities and a gas sampling port. The end-tidal CO2 values from 119 patients divided between the two types of bite blocks (n = 30 standard, n = 89 MA bite block) were compared. Measured end-tidal CO2 values were determined for each patient in three states\u2014awake, sedated before the procedure and sedated during the procedure. With the standard bite block, the oral and nasal values on average varied widely, while the MA bite block showed relatively consistent values on average between the oral and nasal readings and three states. The authors observed that most patients are mouth breathers in sedated upper GI endoscopy and that although oral supplementary oxygen dilutes the gas and reduces the measured end-tidal CO2 value it remains useful. This bite block design as well as several of the commercially available bite blocks with integrated gas sampling ports (e.g. Smart Sureline Guardian Bite Block, Covidien;DualGuard, Flexicare; Safety-Guard, Vygon; TwinGuard, Trawax) may allow for more accurate capnographic recordings and should be considered for use when monitoring CO2 during upper endoscopic procedures [32].",

Since its introduction nearly 40 years ago [36], the differential Fick method and its research and commercial variants (e.g. by NICO, Philips, Wallingford, and CT) have been evaluated in different clinical environments and patient conditions. As the capnodynamic method assumes the mixed venous carbon dioxide concentration (CmvCO2) remains constant during the measurement cycle, therapies and clinical interventions that might impact CmvCO2, as during surgery, were examined. The study found that reperfusion resulted in large changes in PmvCO2, hemodynamics, and lactate with the EPBF transiently increasing to three times (on average) the baseline value before returning to the baseline within 5 min. With prolonged hypercapnia, it was reported that EPBF maintains good agreement and trending with the reference cardiac output measurement (ultrasonic flow probe). EPBF, as a measure of the non-shunted blood flow through the lung, may be estimated by the application of the carbon dioxide Fick principle in a differential form using different perturbations, assumptions, algorithms and software-based correction factors [37, 38].",

The values obtained by EIT were compared to the ones derived by the PEEP/FiO2 table used by the ARDS network and with the PEEP values proposed by the attending clinicians. EIT measurements were performed simultaneously to a PEEP step ramp, first ascending and then descending. As a cut-off the author decided that a difference of 4 cm H2O in suggested PEEP should have been considered clinically relevant. The result of the study was that in 26% of cases the difference between EIT-set PEEP and the one decided by the clinician was clinically relevant and only in the 36% of cases they were equal. This conclusion keeps open the debate on the use of PEEP during ARDS: while it is clear that its application is beneficial during ARDS, its magnitude and the method to define it require further studies. EIT can be useful in understanding the dynamics of lung inflation and response of the lung to PEEP application.",

The cause of ARDS was influenza A pneumonia and her status was characterized by hypoxemia, acidosis and necessity of mechanical ventilation. The management of the case was facilitated by the application of EIT for deciding the best PEEP to be applied. The authors executed a PEEP step incremental\u2013decremental trial. The procedure allowed to identify the entity of recruitment with PEEP application and the range of PEEP potentially associated to derecruitment. The non-invasiveness and the user-friendly sequence of operations allowed the authors to use EIT on an everyday base. This approach gave the opportunity of titrating the PEEP according to the daily status of the lung, allowing to overcome also acute episodes of desaturation determined by changes in pulmonary function.",

For this reason, Schullcke et al. [43] performed a simulation study in order to evaluate the severity of lung obstruction by using EIT. The simulation was conducted via software by implementing a three-dimensional model of the lung. This last was perturbated by introducing ten different degree of obstruction. One of the main results of the study was that two of the more used parameters derived from EIT analysis, Coefficient of Variation and the Global Inhomogeneity Index, were not sensitive to low levels of obstruction. Their performance was better when higher level of obstruction were simulated. The most important message conveyed by this paper is that in future research for improving EIT technology, an important role must be played by simulation studies performed on three-dimensional models of the chest.",

The result was that CT-derived variables could not predict elevated TPTD-derived variables. This study, although proposes different results from other reports, has the merit of including a heterogeneous group of patients, differing also for the type of ventilatory support. The recommendation from the authors was that in this specific problem, further studies are needed for defining the role of CT as substitute of TPTD.",

Methods based on TPTD should be tested in a wider population of intensive care patients and not only in selected sub-populations. However, TPTD methods have the advantage to be bedside and operator-independent technologies. Lung ultrasound methods are reaching an increasing importance in this context also because of the wide availability of training programs.

The authors showed that a fully automated system could normalise the most important respiratory measurements: increasing PaO2/FiO2 ratio from values below 100 mmHg to around 400 mmHg; normalising pH and PaCO2 levels; and reducing driving pressure from levels of 20\u201325 cm H2O to levels between 5 and 10 cm H2O. The primary result of this study was to show that the approach is feasible without human intervention, and that was achieved. The authors were, however, very careful to point out that such results should not be directly extrapolated to ARDS patients who, unlike damage caused by lavage, may have lungs that are not readily recruited, and who may not be as deeply anesthetised or relaxed as the animals used in this study.",

Patients were placed in a steep 45\u00b0 Trendelenburg position with intraperitoneal CO2 insufflation, with the purpose of this study to investigate the effects of obesity and these manoeuvres on pulmonary mechanics and oxygenation. All respiratory parameters were affected negatively by surgical positioning (peak pressure, driving pressure, respiratory system compliance and PaO2/FiO2 ratio). In addition, the detrimental effects were significantly greater in patients with BMI > 30 kg/m2 with driving pressure an average of 5.3 cm H2O greater in patients with BMI > 30 kg/m2 and with values reaching almost 30 cm H2O in this group. These extremely high values of driving pressure in obese patients undergoing this surgical intervention are interesting and important, but should perhaps be interpreted with some caution. For patients with high pulmonary pressures due to increases in abdominal pressure, it is likely that transpulmonary pressure represents a more accurate measurement of the potential damage to the lungs. It has recently been shown that for surgical procedures such as those reported by Blecha et al., that only 50% of the increased driving pressure is seen by the lungs as increased transpulmonary pressure [50], supporting the case for use of esophageal pressure measurements to monitor pulmonary mechanics in such patients.",
