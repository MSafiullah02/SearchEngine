The 1918-1919 influenza pandemic had a mortality rate of 2.5% of those infected and, at the time it had the highest mortality rate since the fourteenth century plague known as the 'Black Death'. More recently, according to the World Health Organization, almost 78 million people have been infected with the HIV virus and about 39 million people have died of HIV. Globally, 35.0 million (33.2-37.2 million) people were living with HIV at the end of 2013 (WHO 2016b). In 2005, avian influenza (H5N1) also known as 'bird flu' had a laboratory confirmed mortality rate of 60 % in those infected with the disease (WHO 2016c). In 2012 the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) was first identified and it has a mortality rate of 36% in reported cases in twenty-six countries (WHO 2016d).",

An influenza pandemic occurs when key factors converge: an influenza virus emerges with the ability to cause sustained transmission from human-to-human, and there is very low, or no, immunity to the virus among most people. Biological risks arising from disease can be developed as part of natural processes or deliberately, and diseases can be spread unintentionally or intentionally. In the interconnected world of today, a localised epidemic can rapidly transform into a pandemic.",

This resulted in an early example of the way a health issue was formally reframed within a politico-diplomatic context by actors outside the health sector. The spread of infectious disease became the subject of international diplomacy and it was raised at the first International Sanitary Conference in Paris in 1851 (Elbe 2010:163) . In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the world experienced several infectious diseases that have had the potential to, or did, spread sufficiently to become a pandemic. In addition to health concerns, infectious diseases hold implications for human security as well as having several socio-economic implications that are not necessarily immediately evident, such as absenteeism, loss of productivity, and increased levels of insecurity in civil society.",

Estimating the actual number of individual cases and deaths is challenging because, in addition to laboratories stopping testing when overwhelmed, many people do not seek medical care; secondly, only a small number of those who do seek care are tested; and thirdly, more people who are hospitalised or die of pandemic-related causes are tested and reported. But under-reporting of hospitalisations and deaths occurs as well because they are not always accurately attributed to an epidemic or pandemic. This has implications for pandemic planners and implicitly means that any planning assumptions need to be rigorously objective and equally, civil society needs to be engaged as part of the planning process to ensure ongoing resilience in adverse circumstances. Fundamental to the planning process are the assumptions relating to the pandemic and the basis of those assumptions. Flawed assumptions can have significant policy and resource implications as well as potentially devastating effects on civil society. For example, planning for an Ebola pandemic based on the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic with its mortality rate of 2.5% of those infected, would be grossly inaccurate. Ebola has a mortality rate of approximately 50% of those infected (World Health Organization 2016a).",

Consequently, the cross-border nature of pandemics has contributed to greater cooperation and information sharing and these are reflected, to some extent, in the 2007 International Health Regulations (Hagen 2013:165) . The Regulations set out the obligations of member-states and the WHO in responding to cross-border public health risks. The IHR require countries to report certain disease outbreaks and public health events to the WHO. The regulations aim to prevent, protect against, control and respond to the international spread of disease while avoiding unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade. Under the IHR, States are required to notify the WHO of all events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern and to respond to requests for verification of information regarding such events. Secondly, States are required to notify and report events and other information through their National IHR Focal Points to a regional WHO IHR Contact Points Focal points and Contact points must be available on a 24 hour-a-day basis, seven days a week. Thirdly, each State Party is required to develop, strengthen and maintain core public health capacities for surveillance and response by using existing national resources, such as the national plans for influenza pandemic preparedness.",

During a pandemic, few people's lives would be unchanged and many existing values would be challenged, such as freedom of movement, or the assumption that everyone would have equal access to antivirals and health services. The WHO recognised the importance of addressing ethical issues as part of governance arrangements related to a pandemic, and produced a series of discussion papers on key issues associated with pandemic preparedness. Following consultation with its 193 member-states, it subsequently produced public health response guidance in 2008 (Gadd 2013:182) . Consideration of ethical issues may be further complicated if resources are limited. This may influence the extent to which a nation-state imposes mandatory measures, which would need to be monitored and enforced to be effective. The allocation of scarce resources leading to benefits for some people over others may conflict with expectations in civil society and generate further levels of anxiety and insecurity. This could have wider implications such as for the maintenance of law and order and general levels of safety in civil society, which in turn affect the authority of a nation-state and its governance.",

Outside Europe, a major offensive biological warfare program began in Japan and ran from 1931 to 1945. The Japanese tested biological agents on humans as well as employing biological agents in military field operations. In China, for example, artillery shells filled with germs were used. The Japanese human experimentation was largely conducted in China on Chinese prisoners of war. The Japanese developed capabilities to produce kilogram quantities of bacteria for plague, anthrax, typhoid, cholera, dysentery and other diseases (Dando 2006: 22-23) .

Scientists generally have argued that the benefits of such experiments and the resulting knowledge outweigh the risks. This has been countered by a number of professional and institutional actors outside the scientific and health sectors who have expressed deep concern. The public nature of the debate also generated unease and concern within civil societies globally, and raised further concerns about accountability and control mechanisms (Resnik 2013; Shamoo and Resnik 2009 ). By adopting the Precautionary Principle, the burden of proof rests with the scientific community to demonstrate that the research should be carried out and, importantly, that it be undertaken in a responsible way. It also requires that researchers consider the potential harms as well as the potential benefits of undertaking the research. Such considerations may result in limiting the proposed research to take account of ethical and professional values.",

However, the NSABB does not have compliance powers. There is no international governing body to monitor or to advise on such issues and there are no overarching compliance requirements with the result that biological dualuse research of concern continues with few constraints. For example, in October 2013, Chinese scientists announced they had created new strains of the influenza virus in a bid to develop vaccines. The announcement generated international criticism including from former president of the UK Royal Society, Lord May, who denounced the work of the team under Professor Chen Hualan, Director of China's National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory. While the research was reportedly conducted in a laboratory with the second highest security level to prevent the virus escaping containment, May is reported to have said: 'The record of containment in labs like this is not reassuring. They are taking it upon themselves to create human-to-human transmission of very dangerous viruses. It's appallingly irresponsible' (Connor 2013) .",

However, the delivery system for a contagious disease, such as pneumonic plague or smallpox, would not need to be highly sophisticated because it would only be necessary to infect a small number of people. After that the initial victims would themselves spread the disease to others. Highly contagious and lethal pathogens can present an even greater danger than nuclear weapons in that they are not limited to the geographical target area, and can continue to spread indefinitely.",

Clearly, knowledge gained from the experiments is valuable and can be used to inform future pandemic planning. However, the global research community is no longer as tightly knit as it used to be, and access to research experiments and studies is now more easily obtained and potentially can be used for adverse effect. In a statement in 2011 before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Assistant Director, Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate Federal Bureau of Investigation, Vahid Majidi reported that the FBI was concerned that many US biological and medical laboratories were vulnerable to insiders based on several incidents involving the illicit acquisition of bacterial and viral cultures. He further reported that there had been numerous attempts to utilise biological toxins to threaten, injure, or kill individuals. In addition the FBI was concerned about the availability of those agents for potential criminal use and that the biological threat is further increased with advances in technologies in the biological sciences that have become more powerful, cheaper, and readily available to much wider audiences (FBI 2011). A subsequent report by UNICRI highlighted that research developments in this area could rekindle military interest in biological weapons and potentially undermine existing national and international oversight regimes (UNICRI 2012). Within this context, relevant legislative and policy controls over such types of research require consideration, such as appropriate security measures and personnel screening at a local level and international controls over the shipment of pathogenic (disease-causing) organisms.",

Notwithstanding that previous biological weapons had demonstrated their potential effectiveness, when the Convention was negotiated in the 1970s there was a perception that they had little military utility. The Convention in its title and in Article 1 does not explicitly prohibit the 'use' of biological weapons. However, the final Declaration of the 1996 Treaty Review Conference reaffirmed that although 'use' was not explicitly prohibited under Article 1 of the Convention, it was still considered to be a violation of the Convention.

Signatory Member States to the Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention could take a more active role in establishing verification protocols. Those Member States which also participate in the Australia Group could leverage their participation to achieve this goal. Biological concerns associated with scientific developments and experiments such as synthetic biology, dual-use research, and gain-of-function research have added a new level of complexity and challenge for policymakers. While a number of nationstates appear to be quite well prepared to deal with an epidemic or a pandemic, many lack policy structures to deal with more complex aspects of dual-use research. Individual nation-states could review their definitions of biosecurity to reflect more accurately the complexities of biological security challenges. The definition of biosecurity developed by the Federation of American Scientists (Federation of American Scientists, 2012) provides an appropriate foundation. The FAS defines biosecurity as any measure aimed at preventing the purposeful misuse of science. It includes measures to prevent access to dangerous pathogens and toxins as well as raising barriers to the production or use of bioweapons. Beside such typical security measures, it includes basic awareness efforts that decrease the possibility of people misusing science from within the academic research community.",
