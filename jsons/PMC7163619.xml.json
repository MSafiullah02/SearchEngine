            "text": "Foal heat diarrhoea is itself a misnomer for short periods of diarrhoea seen between one and 2 weeks of age in otherwise systemically healthy foals. Attempts to identify a causative agent in mare's milk around the time of oestrus have been unsuccessful (Johnston et al. 1970). Further, orphans and foals maintained on milk replacer often also experience a similar episode of diarrhoea, effectively ruling out the mare as a cause (Cymbaluk et al. 1993; Magdesian 2005). A more likely theory involves the normal development of gastrointestinal flora, particularly as the foal begins to ingest other feeds and inoculates its gastrointestinal tract via coprophagy (Masri et al. 1986). Recent work examining bacterial flora and occurrence of diarrhoea in neonatal foals further supports this theory and failed to demonstrate an association between foal heat in dams and onset of diarrhoea in the foal (Kuhl et al. 2011). Affected foals will continue to suckle readily, are afebrile and have no clinical abnormality other than diarrhoea. Thus, owner education and benign neglect are ideal treatments.",

Foals receiving inappropriate or incorrectly prepared milk replacer can develop diarrhoea, secondary to overadministration of lactose or electrolytes (Cymbaluk et al. 1993). Primary lactose intolerance in foals is very rare, but has been reported (Koterba 1990; Roberts et al. 2008; Sloet van Oldruitenborgh\u2010Oosterbaan 2008). There is also a suggested, although still unproven, association between secondary lactose intolerance and enterocolitis of clostridial or rotaviral origin (Weese et al. 1999).",

Regardless of aetiology, the disease is characterised by symptoms of ileus, evidence of pneumatosis intestinalis and necrotic intestinal mucosa/submucosa (Cudd and Pauly 1987; Eser et al. 2002; Magdesian 2005).

Additionally, foals and adult horses can harbour and shed both C. difficile and C. perfringens type A without developing clinical disease, although adults are less likely to do so (Tillotson et al. 2002; B\u00e5verud et al. 2003; Medina\u2010Torres et al. 2011). Clostridium perfringens type C appears to be associated with significant disease but additional work on both prevalence of infection and ideal methods of diagnostic testing are needed (Bueschel et al. 1998; East et al. 1998; Tillotson et al. 2002). The presence or absence of clostridial enterotoxin may help define the pathogenicity of these potential infectious agents (Netherwood et al. 1998; Weese et al. 2001). These infections can be primary in nature or secondary to antimicrobial administration (B\u00e5verud et al. 2003; Arroyo et al. 2004). Regardless of the specific clostridial aetiology, affected foals can present with acute colic and haemodynamic compromise, often prior to the development of clinical diarrhoea. Significant intestinal necrosis may occur and will contribute to rapid decompensation and secondary bacteraemia. Clinical pathological abnormalities will often include significant panleucopenia, hypoproteinaemia, and hyperfibrinogenaemia (Jones et al. 1987; East et al. 1998; Magdesian et al. 2002).

The most common serovars are Typhimurium, Newport, Anatum and Agona (Traub\u2010Dargatz and Besser 2007). Infection in neonates is associated with relatively high mortality in some retrospective work, but this has not been uniformly verified (Netherwood et al. 1996; Frederick et al. 2009). Affected foals are usually febrile, have varying degrees of systemic compromise, and have profound leucopenia often with a toxic left shift (Lester 2003). Localised infections of bones, joints, central nervous system or umbilicus can develop due to bacteraemia, even after recovery from the initial episode of enterocolitis; thus, owners should be cautioned to carefully observe affected foals after the resolution of diarrhoea.",

The virus damages small intestinal microvilli, resulting in decreased absorptive capacity and increased luminal secretion. Diarrhoea is self\u2010limiting in many foals but some develop profuse watery diarrhoea, significant dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities. Older foals have a much greater ability to compensate for small intestinal disease with effective colonic resorption (Magdesian 2005). Both coronavirus and adenovirus have also been isolated from the faeces of diarrhoeic foals, but the true incidence and importance of these infectious agents is not fully understood (McChesney et al. 1973; Corrier et al. 1982; Studdert and Blackney 1982; Davis et al. 2000; Guy et al. 2000).

Measurement of immunoglobulin concentration is indicated in neonates and blood culture is recommended for patients less than 30 days of age. Because approximately 50% of blood cultures from diarrhoeic foals yield growth of at least one infectious agent, blood culture can be a very useful diagnostic tool in this population (Frederick et al. 2009).

Ultrasonographic examination allows for identification of fluid or gas located within the visceral lumen, intestinal wall (pneumatosis intestinalis) or free within the peritoneum as well as examination of intestinal mural thickness, estimation of intestinal distention and evaluation for evidence of intussusception. The internal umbilical remnants can also be evaluated for evidence of infection. If indicated, ultrasonography can also be used to locate an appropriate area for abdominocentesis.

Rhodococcus equi is easily isolated from the faeces of asymptomatic and uninfected foals, therefore diagnosis depends upon intra\u2010abdominal sampling (abdominocentesis or aspirate of peripheral abscess) or an index of suspicion (supported by pulmonary disease). Further confirmation of systemic R. equi can be made with vapA PCR testing (blood, transtracheal wash, abdominal fluid sample or faeces), previously demonstrated to be extremely sensitive and specific for identification of pulmonary disease (Sellon et al. 2001; Halbert et al. 2005; Pusterla et al. 2007).",

            "text": "Foals with mild to moderate diarrhoea and no evidence of colic should generally be allowed to continue suckling. The benefits of continued oral intake often outweigh the risk of exacerbation of enteritis by additional suckling. Oral intake of as little as 60 ml of milk every few hours can provide nutrition for enterocytes (Ousey et al. 1997). Any foal with colic, abdominal distention or suspected rotavirus or clostridial infection will likely benefit from a period of brief gastrointestinal rest (12\u201324 h) (Magdesian 2005). Villous damage can result in transient maldigestion and lactase deficiency, thus exogenous lactase (Lactaid, 3000\u20136000 FCC units per os q. 6 h) during re\u2010feeding is a useful adjunct in some foals (McAuliffe and Slovis 2008; Sloet van Oldruitenborgh\u2010Oosterbaan 2008). For foals kept from suckling for longer than 12\u201324 h in older foals or 4\u20136 h in neonates, caloric requirements should be provided parenterally (Buechner\u2010Maxwell 1998; Magdesian 2005). The addition of dextrose (typically 5% of a maintenance fluid rate or a rate of 4\u20138 mg/kg bwt/min i.v.) to fluid therapy is adequate to meet caloric requirements for up to 24\u201348 h. For more intensive or prolonged cases that cannot tolerate oral nutrition, partial or total parenteral nutrition (PPN or TPN) can be provided with the addition of amino acids with or without lipids to dextrose solutions. There is significant information available elsewhere regarding the preparation and administration of these TPN solutions (Buechner\u2010Maxwell 2005; McKenzie and Geor 2009). Although it can be costly to administer, provision of parenteral nutrition can prevent a catabolic state associated with prolonged malnutrition. Intermittent blood glucose concentrations should be monitored with patients requiring parenteral feeding or young foals on limited suckling to ensure euglycaemia. One should note that neither euglycaemia nor hyperglycaemia rule out the presence of a negative energy balance.",
