This has been another access barrier because many patients have been forced to stop or delay their ECT treatments. In the same way, patients who were receiving continuation and maintenance ECT have also been stopped. In this group, the risk of infection when reaching the hospital and the state of emergency announced by the government have also hindered their access to hospitals.
