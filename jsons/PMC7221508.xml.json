All respiratory viruses positively identified in the laboratory by use of the respiratory viral panel and rapid influenza or RSV tests were reviewed. Adenovirus, coronavirus (not coronavirus disease 2019), influenza, parainfluenza, RSV, and human metapneumovirus were included for analysis. The weekly number of positive tests between January 2012 and December 2016 was extracted to construct a longitudinal case series for 4 age groups: 0 to 4 years, 5 to 17 years, 18 to 64 years, and 65 years and older.",

With the exception of influenza virus, which first started in the 18- to 64-year age group, most respiratory virus infections occurred in the 0- to 4-year age group before other age groups, including peak detection of the coronavirus (Table). The Table shows the number and percentage of total cases, the lagged period (in weeks) with respect to the reference age group (ie, 0-4 years for adenovirus), and their mean (SE) correlation coefficients with statistical significance. In the 65 years and older age group, peak detection of influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and human metapneumovirus occurred 3 weeks after peak detection in the 0- to 4-year age group (mean [SE] correlation coefficient, 0.215 [0.064]; P = .001), 4 weeks after peak detection in the 5- to 17-year age group (mean [SE] correlation coefficient, 0.155 [0.044]; P < .001), and 2 weeks after peak detection in the 18- to 64-year age group (mean [SE] correlation coefficient, 0.139 [0.038]; P < .001), respectively. Peak detection of RSV in the 65 years and older age group occurred 4 weeks after peak detection in the 0- to 4-year age group (mean [SE] correlation coefficient, 0.079 [0.021]; P < .001).",

            "text": "We found that the detection of RSV in the youngest age group, for whom the incidence first peaked, was correlated with its detection in older age groups weeks later. This finding was similar to that of a Belgian study4 that found peak RSV detection in elderly patients (aged \u226565 years) 6 weeks after peak detection in young children (aged <6 years). In contrast, a study from Hong Kong3 found no age synchrony, suggesting that geographic, climactic, and/or cultural differences (eg, mixing between different age groups or social interactions) may play a role in determining the epidemiology of RSV. A Canadian study1 found that peak influenza activity occurred in the 10- to 19-year age group before other age groups. A study5 of social contact networks suggests that this may reflect the high number of contact level hours among high school students being the local transmission driver of influenza. However, we identified peak detection of influenza virus initially in adults aged 18 to 64 years. It is unclear whether this reflects differences in past exposure to the influenza virus strains circulating during our study period,6 or whether there is another yet unidentified explanation. We also found that, like other respiratory viruses, coronavirus first peaked among young children aged 0 to 4 years and then was followed by a peak among children aged 5 to 17 years. It is important to learn the transmission dynamics of coronavirus to guide policy making on public health countermeasures for the current coronavirus 2019 pandemic.",
