Through recently developed diagnostic assays, routine serologic screening of blood donors has prevented most cases of posttransfusion hepatitis. The purpose of this paper is to comprehensively review current information regarding the virology of HCV. Recent findings on the genome organization, its relationship to other viruses, the replication of HCV ribonucleic acid, HCV translation, and HCV polyprotein expression and processing are discussed. Also reviewed are virus assembly and release, the variability of HCV and its classification into genotypes, the geographic distribution of HCV genotypes, and the biologic differences between HCV genotypes. The assays used in HCV genotyping are discussed in terms of reliability and consistency of resuits, and the molecular epidemiology of HCV infection is reviewed. These approaches to HCV epidemiology will prove valuable in documenting the spread of HCV in different risk groups, evaluating alternative (nonparenteral) routes of transmission, and in understanding more about the origins and evolution of HCV.",

Among human viruses, these include both Picomaviridae (eg, poliovirus, coxsackievirus A and B, and hepatitis A virus) and Flaviviridae (eg, dengue fever and yellow fever virus). The genomes of those viruses have a similar organization with structural proteins at the 5' end and nonstructural proteins at the 3' end. However, virus families differ in genome size, the number of proteins produced, the mechanism by which the polyprotein is cleaved, and the detailed mechanism of genome replication. For example, the genome of the Picornaviridae is shorter than that of HCV (approximately 7200 to 8400 bases), contains four nucleocapsid proteins (compared with the single protein of HCV), is nonenveloped (and therefore contains no homologues of the two HCV-encoded HCV glycoproteins E 1 and E2), and uses exclusively virus-encoded proteases to cleave its polyprotein. This is different from both HCV and the Flaviviridae, in which cleavage of the structural proteins is thought to be carried out by the host cell--derived signalase.",

They have a similar genome size (yellow fever virus has 10,862 bases 4 compared with 9379 for HCV 3) and package a viral-encoded glycoprotein into the virus envelope (El). The homologue of E2 in flaviviruses (a membrane-bound glycoprotein called NS 1; \"NS\" stands for nonstructural) is expressed only on the infected cell surface. Like HCV, the polyprotein is cleaved by a combination of viral and host cell proteases. Although there is no close sequence similarity between HCV and other known viruses, at least two regions with conserved amino acid residues provide Another fundamental aspect of genome organization that differs between the flavivirus and picornavirus families is the structure of the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). These parts of the genome are involved in HCV replication and initiation of translation by cellular ribosomes of the virus-encoded polyprotein. Pestiviruses and HCV show evidence for a highly structured 5'UTR and 3'UTR, in which internal base-pairing produces a complex set of stem-loop structures that are thought to interact with various host cell and virus proteins during replication. 7,8 In particular, studies have shown that for the Picornaviridae and, more recently, for HCV and pestiviruses, 7,9A\u00b0 such structures are involved in internal initiation of translation, in which binding to the host cell ribosome directs translation to an internal methionine (AUG) codon. This contrasts strongly with translation of flavivirus genomes, which act much like cellular messenger RNA in which ribosomal binding initially occurs to the capped 5' end of the RNA, followed by scanning of the sequence in the 5' to 3' direction with translation commencing from the first AUG codon.",

For example, a 200-amino-acid sequence of part of NS3 of GBV-A and GBV-B shows 47% and 55% sequence similarity with the homologous region in HCV (positions 1298 to 1497 in the HCV polyprotein) 3 and 43.5% sequence similarity to each other.

Comparisons of a 100-amino-acid sequence surrounding this motif indicate a close relationship between HCV and GBV-A and GBV-B, an intermediate degree of relatedness with the pestivirus bovine viral diarrhea virus, and a much more distant relatedness to fiaviviruses ( Figure 2 ). 6 '13 Remarkably, a series of plant viruses that are structurally distinct from each of the mammalian virus groups, and with different genome organizations, have RNA-dependent RNA polymerase amino acid sequences that are perhaps more similar to those of HCV than are the flaviviruses.",

Many of the published methods for \"genotyping\" are based on amplification of viral sequences in clinical specimens, either by using type-specific primers that selectively amplify different genotypes, by analyzing the PCR product by hybridization with genotype-specific probes, or by using restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP). The assays have different strengths and weaknesses. For example, methods based on amplification and analysis of 5'NCR sequences have advantages of sensitivity, because this region is highly conserved and can be more frequently amplified from HCV-infected patients than other parts of the genome. However, few nucleotide differences are found between different genotypes. Although reliably differentiating six major genotypes by using RFLP or by type-specific probes is possible, it is not always possible to reliably identify virus subtypes. Types 2a and 2b consistently differ at position -124, allowing them to be differentiated by the restriction enzyme ScrF167 orby probes 10 to 13 in the INNO-LIPA (Innogenetics, Zwijnaarde, Belgium). 71 However, sequences of type 2c are indistinguishable from some of those of type 2a. Similarly, some of the novel subtypes of type 1 often show sequences identical to those of type la or lb, 54,60 and a small proportion of type la variants are identical to type lb and vice versa. 22 Typing methods based on coding regions, such as core and NS5, can reliably identify subtypes as well as major genotypes because the degree of sequence divergence is much greater (Table III) . However, amplifying sequences in coding regions of the genome generally is difficult because sequence variability in the primer-binding sites may reduce the effectiveness of sequence amplification by PCR. Nevertheless, the variation is exploited in a genotyping assay that uses type-specific primers complimentary to variable regions in the core gene. Currently, this assay can identify and differentiate types la, lb, 2a, 2b, and 3a, 1\u00b07A\u00b08 although the method is technically complicated to perform reliably 1\u00b09 and may be difficult to extend to the great range of HCV genotypes now described.",

Changes in the E1 and E2 genes may alter the antigenicity of the virus to allow \"immune escape\" from neutralizing antibodies, 112 therefore accounting for both the high degree of envelope sequence variability and the observed persistent nature of HCV infection. Supporting this model is the observation that much of the variability in the E1 and E2 genes is concentrated in discrete \"hypervariable\" regions, 112-114 possibly reflecting the pressures on the virus to evade immune recognition at specific sites where HCV may be neutralized.",

Many of the current uncertainties may be resolved when a satisfactory in vitro neutralization assay is developed for HCV that enables the effect of amino acid changes in the envelope gene to be directly investigated. Additional information also is needed on the relative importance of humoral and cell-mediated immunity to HCV and to determine which is more important in virus clearance and protection from reinfection.",

The large number of replication cycles, combined with the relatively error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, leads to measurable sequence drift of HCV over time. For example, over an 8-year interval of persistent infection in a chim-panzee, the rate of sequence change for the genome as a whole was 0.144% per site per year, 115 similar to the rate calculated for sequence change in the 5' half of the genome over 3 years observed in a human carrier (0.192%) 125 and in a crosssectional study. 126 Using this \"molecular clock,\" it is possible in principle to calculate times of divergence between HCV variants and therefore to establish their degree of epidemiologic relatedness. For example, the finding of relatively few sequence differences between variants infecting two individuals would provide evidence of recent HCV transmission between them. Sequence comparisons in variable regions, such as E2 and NS5, of the HCV genome have been used to document transmission between persons, either from mother to child, 127 within families, 128 by iatrogenic routes, 129-132 or by sexual contact.
