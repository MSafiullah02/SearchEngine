The results of the present study suggest that attitudes toward people with a serious illness also may be linked to their perceived characteristics, when the risk of contracting the disease is low. Both these sets of results are consistent with the findings of Bishop et al.'s (1991) earlier study of the willingness of participants to interact with a person with a fictitious illness.",

Men also expressed less favorable attitudes toward people living with HIV/AIDS in terms of expressions of sympathy and their willingness to have social contact with them (Heaven et al., 1990). These findings are consistent with the perception that men face a greater risk of contracting HIV/AIDS than do women.

If the risk of contracting the disease is regarded as high, attitudes toward people with the illness may be based largely on fear of contracting it. When the disease does not appear to be contagious, the characteristics of the people who are affected by the illness may influence attitudes toward them. These findings represent a refinement of Crandall et al.'s (1997) model, which may provide a more comprehensive framework for understanding public attitudes toward people with a serious illness (e.g., those affected by the 2003 outbreak of the SARS virus) and allow health professionals to develop intervention programs that are appropriate to the perceived risk of contracting a disease within the community. At the same time, support for the model would be strengthened by a replication of this study with a sample of the population that was based more broadly, particularly in terms of age and educational background.",
