There is certainly no doubt that genetic differences impact on the risk of developing or dying from infection. Obvious but rare examples include selective immunoglobulin deficiencies, complement deficiencies, and neutrophil function abnormalities. Genetic factors may also be protective, such as with sickle cell trait and malaria or mutations conferring resistance to human immunodeficiency virus infection.",

Rather than causing the failure of production of a protein or the production of a nonfunctional protein, SNPs are usually associated with changes in the rate of transcription, producing a much less severe phenotype than the classical examples of genetic defects mentioned above. It is now being appreciated that for many complex diseases, such as sepsis, the ultimate phenotype is the result of the interaction of genetic differences across many loci, not the dominant effect of a few key mutations.",

A variety of mutations can occur in DNA, some of which leading to the change in function or production of a gene product. The simplest change is the substitution of one nucleotide for another, a SNP. A number of other mutations occur including the deletion or insertion of one or more nucleotides, including the insertion of multiple repeating sequences, sometimes called a microsatellite.",

This nomenclature dominated the literature for nearly a decade as it is intuitively easy to understand and the number system gives an idea of what the functional significance of the polymorphism is likely to be (e.g., a negative value places it most likely in the promoter region, a positive value in an intron or an exon).

All of these polymorphisms are candidates for studies in genetic influences on sepsis and its outcomes, and Table 3 .1 summarizes studies that have been published. As there is substantial overlap between the functions of many cytokines, and frequently multiple antagonists for any given agonist, there is a significant ability to compensate for a certain amount of divergence in production of individual cytokines. Therefore, for a single mutation to influence the outcome of an inflammatory response, it must markedly alter the production or function of a critical inflammatory protein. While possible, the more likely scenario already discussed is the inheritance of multiple mutations in multiple proteins, each leading to small changes in production or function, interacting to lead to a net serious deleterious effect.",

TLR4 is however unlikely to play an important role in gram-positive sepsis as TLR2 is more specific for recognition of peptidoglycans from gram-positive bacteria. Rare TLR2 polymorphisms have been described as increasing the risk of gram-positive infections (Sutherland et al. 2005b ) and a TLR5 mutation has been associated with an increased risk of legionella infection (Hawn et al. 2003 ).",

The TNF-308 polymorphism is in significant linkage disequilibrium with multiple other polymorphic sites within TNF itself and in the wider MHC region. This extensive linkage disequilibrium may not only explain the disparate findings between studies, but also why after over a decade of research, there is no agreement on whether or not the different TNF-308 alleles result in differential production of TNF (Bayley et al. 2004 ).",

In the latter study, it was interesting that respiratory failure correlated with the GG genotype (Waterer et al. 2001) , the opposite of the association for shock.

Two SNPs, the IL-1\u03b2+3953 and \u2212511, which have both been suggested to influence levels of IL-1\u03b2 (Pociot et al. 1992 ), were associated with increased risk of death from meningococcal infection in one cohort study (Read et al. 2000) but not with susceptibility to or outcome from septic shock (Fang et al. 1999) .

A significant association between the A allele of HSPA1B+1267 and septic shock has been demonstrated in an extension of the pneumonia study mentioned above (Waterer et al. 2003) , which was even stronger than that of the LTA+252. This stronger association, combined with functional studies showing that the HSP-A1B polymorphism was associated with variable HSP-70 production and TNF production (Temple et al. 2004 ) strongly suggests that this is the \"real\" cause of the associations described with LTA+252.",

As early studies typically contained less than 100 subjects, even a few genotyping errors, particularly with rare genotypes, can have a dramatic impact on statistical significance.
