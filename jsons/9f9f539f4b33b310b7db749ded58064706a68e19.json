Reliable detection and differentiation from seasonal influenza viruses is mandatory for appropriate case management as well as public health. Objectives: To develop and technically validate a novel one-step real-time RT-PCR assay which can be used for influenza A virus screening and subtyping of A/H1N1v in a singleplex fashion. To assess the clinical performance of a novel commercial influenza RT-PCR kit based on the in-house version. Study design: A real-time RT-PCR assay targeting the matrix gene of influenza A viruses was developed and validated using in vitro transcribed RNA derived from influenza A/H1N1v, A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 virus as well as plaque-quantified influenza A/H1N1v, A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 virus samples. After validation of the in-house version the commercial RealStar kit was used to assess the clinical performance and specificity on a panel of influenza viruses including A/H1N1v, A/H1N1, swine A/H1N1, A/H3N2, avian A/H5N1 as well as patient specimens. Results: The lower limit of detection of the in-house version was 2149, 1376 and 2994 RNA copies/ml for A/H1N1v, A/H1N1 and A/H3N2, respectively. The RealStar kit displayed 100% sensitivity and specificity and could reliably discriminate influenza A viruses from A/H1N1v. No cross reaction with swine A/H1N1 and A/H1N2 was observed with the RealStar A/H1N1v specific probe.

In both influenza A virus panels a range of different RNA target concentrations was used with cycle threshold (C t ) values from 21.7 to >40. Accordingly 55 stored influenza A virus positive patient samples including 20 A/H1N1v samples yielded positive results by the in-house assay. The LOD of the RealStar kit was assessed using the plaquequantified influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and A/H1N1v virus. Tenfold limiting dilution series were tested in triplicates. At least 1-10 PFU/ml were detectable by both assays rendering them equally sensitive (data not shown). Correspondingly the LOD was determined using in vitro transcribed RNA as above. A 95% LOD of 380 [95% CI 285-998], 586 [95% CI 427-1300] and 1399 [95% CI 1006-2831] RNA copies/ml for influenza A/H1N1v, seasonal influenza A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 was determined, respectively. A panel of different influenza A virus subtypes including swine A/H1N1 and A/H1N2 yielded no fluorescent signal by the A/H1N1vspecific probe but was positive by the universal influenza A virus probe. Furthermore all 27 seasonal influenza A and 22 A/H1N1v positive samples were correctly identified by the RealStar assay ( Table 2 ). Similar to the in-house version even low concentrated samples were detectable. Of note, C t values obtained by the RealStar kit were in general lower than those obtained by the in-house version and the reference assays which might in part reflect the higher sample input volume of the kit. Finally, 126 A/H1N1v positive patient samples were re-evaluated by the Real-Star kit and all yielded concordant results. 7 C t values for the A/H1N1v specific RT-PCR ranged from 22.5 to 42 (mean 32.8) and for the RealStar kit from 17.9 to 38.5 (mean 27.4), respectively (p < 0.0001, paired t-test).

In addition we describe the evaluation of one of the first commercial test kits specifically designed to meet the demands of the current pandemic. The RealStar kit rendered to be even more sensitive than the in-house assay most likely attributed to the higher sample input volume and equally specific. Particularly on a panel of original A/H1N1v patient samples the RealStar kit showed superior performance to a widely used realtime RT-PCR. 3 Detection of low concentrated samples may become important to, e.g. monitor virus concentrations in patients treated with oseltamivir. 9 In the midst of an epidemic rapid provision of ready-to-use test kits has a significant impact on the performance of laboratories. 10, 11 Although A/H1N1v in house diagnostic tests were designed and implemented with outstanding rapidity frontline laboratories may lack the capacity to implement these assays. 11 Availability of ready-to-use systems might therefore assist laboratories in patient management and surveillance. Combined with its rapidity, internal control system and quality controlled reagents this approach might be useful for general public health laboratories.
