Traditional sensor systems are multistep platforms that often times rely heavily on off-platform post-processing to determine the outcome of detection or classify the biomolecule detected. Current high-throughput systems use traditional or silicon-based computing for interpretation of molecular recognition events. Complex bioinformatics algorithms are tasked with de-noising and processing sensor output signals. This approach can be error prone and not easily integrated into emerging microsystem technologies for hand held, lab-on-chip systems.

Electrochemical detection provides significant advantages over other common detection and signal transduction methods. Specifically, it is sensitive, rapid, and can provide greater specificity and sensitivity over optical detection methods, as interfering background fluorescence does not adversely affect the electrochemical signal. Electrochemical detection systems are also more amenable to miniaturization and integration given that the signal is already in a form that can be interpreted by silicone microprocessors and integrated circuit fabrication methods can be leveraged to produce the miniaturized components.

Combining the logic operations in a small logic network results in biosensor output in the form of a Yes/No response. Inputs to the sensor are typically chemicals and/or enzyme(s), and the Yes/No output is typically a change in solution pH, color, optical density, or electrochemical properties.

Thus, nearly all DNA-based biosensors rely on either (1) amplification of the target prior to introduction to the sensor, or (2) post-hybridization labeling that significantly amplifies the signal from each hybridization event. For example, a recent article reviewed detection technologies for identifying genetically modified organisms (GMO) in food and feed [5]. The authors stated that DNA-based biosensors are the \u2018leading edge\u2019 technology for simple, rapid and inexpensive testing for GMOs.

Detection of the label provides many orders of magnitude enhancement in the signal from each hybridization event. For example, Kawde and Wang used a triple amplification technique resulting in attomolar DNA detection limits [43]. As shown in Fig. 1, streptavidin coated polystyrene spheres (PS) decorated with biotinylated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were used as labels for DNA hybridization. Hybridization between the magnetic bead-bound DNA probe and the labeled target sequence (step a) was followed by further catalytic deposition of gold onto the AuNPs (step b). Detection of the binding event occurred by dissolution of the Au (step c) and stripping voltammetry in which the gold ions are accumulated onto a carbon electrode over many seconds, and then stripped from the electrode by reversing the applied potential. The multi-step strategy yielded a 300 attomolar (10\u221218 mol/L) DNA detection limit, eliminating the need for sample pre-amplification by PCR. However, the steps required for this, and other similar amplification strategies, significantly increase the complexity of the sensor making it impractical as a reliable and robust fieldable device.\n",

These hybridization chips are fabricated by immobilization, or in situ synthesis, of thousands of single stranded DNA probes (up to 106 unique probes/cm2) on a planar support (glass, silicon, or plastic) [118]. Target samples are introduced to the array and hybridization reactions are performed under conditions of high stringency such that mishybridizations are prevented.

The complementarity results in the strand ends hybridizing and forming a stem-loop structure [112], as shown in Fig. 2. The loop region of the strand contains a probe sequence that is complementary to the target sequence. Traditional molecular beacons contain a fluorophore and quencher on each arm of the stem. In the absence of target molecules, the stem-loop structure forms and the fluorophore is brought into close proximity to the quencher, suppressing fluorescence. When target DNA/RNA is present, hybridization occurs with the loop, breaking the stem region and separating the fluorophore and quencher. This results in a strong increase in probe fluorescence (see Fig. 2).\n",

In the absence of complementary DNA, the hairpin loop brings the ferrocene group in close proximity to the gold electrode surface, facilitating efficient redox reaction electron transfer.

Addition of DNA ligase to the system joins the detection DNA to the surface immobilized capture DNA, forming a single DNA strand. Washing and thermal dehybridization removes the protein and target DNA. Incubation in blank hybridization buffer results in formation of a stem-loop structure as the detection DNA strand contains a 6-base sequence near the ferrocene group that is complementary to the 5\u2032 end of the capture probe.

Finally, the relatively highest currents from point mutation strands were measured when single-base mutations were at the third and fourth position from the ligation point. Still, the currents measured for these single-base pair mismatches were between only 0.6 and 5% of the signal obtained from the fully complementary target sequence which was approximately 70 nA at the highest target concentration.

Often described as homologous to antibodies, aptamers can bind molecules from small inorganic ions, proteins, to even living cells [35]. Unlike antibodies, aptamers are more stable, simple to modify with functional groups, easy to purify and produce, can be developed against virtually any molecule, and do not require animals or cell lines to generate. A potential disadvantage of aptamers is that conditions under which the target molecule and aptamer are introduced (e.g. ionic strength, pH, temperature, protein content) cannot deviate significantly from those used during the SELEX selection process (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential amplification) or the aptamer will not fold and bind with high avidity.",

As shown in Fig. 6, a nucleic acid-based aptamer that recognizes cocaine was engineered with instability in one stem of a three-way junction that binds cocaine. The short stem was labeled with a fluorophore and a quencher that in the absence of cocaine remains open and emits fluorescence. Introduction of cocaine results in a conformational change that brings the fluorophore and quencher in close proximity, reducing fluorescence output (see Fig. 6, right panel).

In the presence of target oligonucleotide, the stem-loop structure is broken. The change in structure allosterically activates the deoxyribozyme complex. Leveraging the structural modularity of catalytic molecular beacons Stojanovic and colleagues have produced AND, NOT, XOR, YES and other DNA-based logic gates and circuits [54, 100, 102\u2013104]. In the YES gate example presented in Fig. 7, the deoxyribozyme module is a hammerhead-type that cleaves an oligonucleotide substrate only in the presence of DNA target. This substrate is labeled with a fluorophore on the 5\u2032 end, and a quencher on the 3\u2032 end.

They can potentially integrate several molecular inputs, perform logical operations, and output an actionable signal and/or autonomously output the appropriate therapeutic. We have reported the development of a deoxyribozyme-based intelligent computational biosensor for the detection of genetic modifications in avian influenza [64, 65]. First, the deoxyribozyme YESiA (E6) gate was constructed, based on a previously reported modular design [99], that appended a 15 nucleotide molecular beacon recognition loop into a hammerhead-type deoxyribozyme (Fig. 8, left panel). Using a substrate labeled with a fluorophore and quencher, the YESiA (E6) deoxyribozyme exhibited a 14-fold increase in fluorescent signal intensity, resulting in a detection limit of 22.7 pM target DNA that was resolvable in only 3 min. This impressive detection limit and response time was a consequence of the catalytic behavior of the deoxyribozyme molecular beacon. Unlike traditional molecular beacons that are limited by a 1:1 target:signal stoichiometry, a single target DNA activates a given catalytic beacon, resulting in the cleaving of several substrate molecules. Thus, PCR amplification of target DNA prior to introduction to the sensor may not be required for such systems, greatly simplifying development of a portable and robust diagnostic instrument.\n",

We compiled 45 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) containing target sequences, representing all possible single point mutations for each of the 15 positions in the target sequence. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 8, discrimination between the targets and SNP-containing sequences was possible in only 5 min. Further, the kinetic behavior of the YESiA (E6) deoxyribozyme was impacted by the location and type of mutation in a quasi-predictable manner. This opened the exciting possibility of algorithm based analysis of the sensor output for predicting the exact location and composition of a given mutant [64]. This is potentially a powerful capability for DNA based sensors which typically cannot identify mismatches with high fidelity, and are not effective at detecting near neighbors for which the sensor was not designed. Development of a substrate-specific algorithm will be discussed more fully in Sect. 3.2.",

Early detection of viruses containing either or both mutations is critical to averting a pandemic. The HAANDPB2 gate showed the ability to discriminate each normal input target (HA only, PB2 only, HA + PB2) and each mutant input sequence (normal HA/mutated PB2, normal PB2/mutated HA, mutated HA/mutated PB2).

Our method for finding highly informative subsequences was based on the integration of sequence alignment and information theory algorithms. As an example application we consider the design of a deoxyribozyme-based computational sensor for identification and monitoring of H5N1, the causative agent of influenza (May et al. [65]. Surveillance plus antigenic and genetic analysis have been used to monitor known H5N1 variants and identify emerging sublineages [97]. Large-scale sequencing efforts, such as the St. Jude Influenza Genome Project [71], provide genetic information for the design of computational biosensors that can aid in tracking and characterizing regional strains of H5N1. Since the genomic sequence of influenza viruses is highly mutable [27, 72] given a set of subtypes or strains, it was challenging to find several highly conserved regions that sufficiently distinguish the groups. In designing the FluChip diagnostic microarray, Mehlmann et al. manually inspected a phylogenetic tree of influenza sequences to identify clades that had sufficient sequence similarity [66]. These clades were then used in an automated probe extraction strategy. To encourage process uniformity and minimize design time, we developed extraction methods that minimize the manual intervention in the probe identification process.",

We then created a multiple alignment of the five consensus sequences, in order to index the nucleotides across all sequences uniformly.

We reduced the candidate probe set by removing the most infrequent words, such that at least 90% of the individuals in the alignment contained one of the words in the reduced set.

This approach often yields simple to interpret, semi-quantitative data with very low detection limit. Use of fluorophores of differing colors also allows for multianalyte biodetection. However, fluorescence-based detection requires an excitation light source, optics to filter the excitation wavelength from the emitted fluorescence wavelength, and a photo detector sensitive to the emitted fluorescence.

Infrared or visible light at a single wavelength near the surface plasmon resonance condition is directed incident to the gold surface at the resonance angle, resulting in a minimum of the reflected light intensity. Upon binding of the target DNA to the probe surface, the surface resonance condition is altered, resulting in a change in the refractive index [16, 73]. Thus, a significant advantage of SPR-based DNA detection is that no label is required.

This allows for detection of molecules on the SERS substrate that would normally be undetectable using Raman alone. This phenomenon has resulted in the bourgeoning field of SERS-based detection of molecules of biomedical interest and the development of many SERS probes/substrates [90]. For example, the Vo-Dinh group has used SERS for detection of DNA hybridization to targets specific for breast cancer and the HIV-1 viral gene [114]. Nanomaterials modified with aptamers have also been widely used for SERS-based biosensing [117]. Although sensitive and specific, this technique can still require target amplification (typically PCR) as the detection limits are not sufficiently low for detection of DNA levels in real-world samples. Also, although portable Raman spectrometers are currently commercially available, these devices can be challenging to operate in the field, must be calibrated to the specific target, can be confounded by complex sample solutions, and are expensive [61].",

Optical and chemiluminescence approaches are advantages in that the results can typically be read by eye, thus they do not require laboratory equipment or significant training to read. However, the detection limit of these systems is often poor as sufficient signal must be generated to be visually discernable. Better detection limits are possible using spectrometers for absorbance/light intensity measurements. However, using such a device negates the advantage of using a detection system that can be read by eye. In the case of the aptamer-DNAzyme system mentioned above, in which the optical signal is catalytically amplified beyond the 1:1 target to signal ratio, the detection limit of AMP was still only 4 \u03bcM. Thus, optical based systems for DNA detection have not yet found significant use outside the laboratory.",
