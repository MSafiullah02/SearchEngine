This was chosen based on analysis of the new coronavirus's evolutionary history and associated pathogen (ie, SARS\u2010CoV). The virus, which emerged in December 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, causes a respiratory illness called COVID\u201019, which can spread from person to person.\n1\n, \n2\n As of 21 February 2020, there have been 76 288 cases of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 confirmed in mainland China, including 11 477 serious, 2 345 deaths, and 20 659 discharged, as well as 68 cases in Hong Kong, 10 in Macao, and 26 in Taiwan. More than 1300 cases have also been confirmed in at least 27 other countries on four continents. World Health Organization (WHO) officials outlined their top research priorities for controlling the outbreak of the coronavirus\u2010associated disease known as COVID\u201019 and highlighted the importance of developing candidate therapeutics and easy\u2010to\u2010apply diagnostics for identifying active, asymptomatic, and resolved infections. Of note, the Coronaviridae family not only includes SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, but also SARS\u2010CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV), and common cold viruses (eg, 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1).\n3\n The SARS\u2010CoV pathogen was responsible for >8 000 cases and 774 deaths in 37 countries during the 2002 to 2003 SARS outbreak,\n4\n, \n5\n, \n6\n and the MERS\u2010CoV pathogen was responsible for 2 494 cases and 858 deaths in 27 countries during the 2012 MERS outbreak.\n7\n, \n8\n\n",

Furthermore, to stem future outbreaks of this type and preventing the transmission of zoonotic diseases to humans should be a top research priority.",

By analyzing more than 1 000 metagenomic samples and using molecular biology testing, they found that the positive rate of \u03b2 coronavirus in pangolins was 70% and that the genome sequence of an isolated virus strain was 99% similar to that of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus.

Based on Bayesian time\u2010scaled phylogenetic analysis using the constrained evolutionary rate method with a log\u2010normal prior (mean = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions per site per year; 95% BCI: 1.854 \u00d7 10\u22124 to 4 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions per site per year) placed on the evolutionary rate parameter, the estimated TMRCA dates and evolutionary rates for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 from \u201cdataset_70\u201d ranged from 21 May 2019 to 13 October 2019 (95% BCI: 27 and 30 January 2020) and from 1.57 \u00d7 10\u22124 to 1.06 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions per site per year (95% BCI: 1.08 \u00d7 10\u22124 to 3.10 \u00d7 10\u22123), respectively (Table 1). Furthermore, based on Bayesian time\u2010scaled phylogenetic analysis using the tip\u2010dating method, the estimated TMRCA dates and evolutionary rates from \u201cdataset_70\u201d ranged from 22 to 24 November 2019 (95% BCI: 23 October 2019 and 16 December 2019) and from 1.19 \u00d7 10\u22123 to 1.31 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions per site per year (95% BCI: 6.22 \u00d7 10\u22124 to 1.96 \u00d7 10\u22123), respectively (Table 1). Thus, the estimated TMRCA dates and evolutionary rates for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 from \u201cdataset_70\u201d were consistent among the different clock models (strict and relaxed) but were distinct among the different dating methods (constrained\u2010dating and tip\u2010dating). The estimated TMRCA dates and evolutionary rates for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 from \u201cdataset_70\u201d using the tip\u2010dating method exhibited much narrower 95% BCIs than the constrained\u2010dating method. In addition, the estimated TMRCA dates and evolutionary rates for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 from \u201cdataset_70\u201d were consistent between the different coalescent tree models (ie, constant and exponential) when using the tip\u2010dating method but were distinct when using the constrained\u2010dating method. For each data set, we employed the HKY nucleotide substitution model, as well as a constant size coalescent tree prior and strict molecular clock model to estimate the TMRCA. The estimates of the MCC phylogenetic relationships among the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 genomes from the Bayesian coalescent framework using the tip\u2010dating method, as well as the constant size coalescent tree prior and strict molecular clock, are displayed in Figure 4. As shown, eight phylogenetic clusters (number of sequences 2 to 7; posterior probability 0.99 to 1.0) were identified.",

These results are consistent with the ML phylogenetic analyses, which showed polytomy topology from \u201cdataset_70\u201d (Figure 2). However, NJ phylogenetic analyses showed a more bifurcating tree topology compared with the ML phylogenetic analyses (Figure S1). This is a good example showing the differences between NJ and ML phylogenetic construction methods. \u201cDataset_70\u201d had a minor strong positive temporal signal based on root\u2010to\u2010tip regression and ML dating analyses (Figures 3 and S2), with the estimated TMRCA dates and evolutionary rates for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 found to be nearly identical using both analyses (Table 1). The estimated TMRCA dates and evolutionary rates for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 were very similar across different clock models and coalescent tree priors using the tip\u2010dating method. The estimated TMRCA dates and evolutionary rates for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 were also very similar across different clock models using the constrained\u2010dating method, but highly distinct across the different coalescent tree priors (Table 1). The TMRCA estimated by the tip\u2010dating method was relatively narrower than that determined by the constrained\u2010dating method, consistent with our previous studies.\n46\n, \n47\n Bayesian analyses with the tip\u2010dating method using a strict clock as well as constant size coalescent tree prior indicated that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is evolving at a rate of 1.24 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions per site per year (Table 1), in accordance with our prior research\n46\n, \n47\n and similar to that found for other human coronaviruses.\n41\n Our results also suggest that the virus originated on 24 November 2019, which is in further agreement with our earlier studies.\n46\n, \n47\n We identified eight phylogenetic clusters (number of sequences 2 to 7) with posterior probabilities between 0.99 and 1.0 using Bayesian inference (Figure 4). We also identified six transmission clusters (number of sequences 2 to 23) when the genetic distance between the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 strains was <0.001% substitutions/site (Figure 5). However, our conclusions should be considered preliminary and explained with caution due to the limited number of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 genome sequences presented in this study. As more genome sequences become available, there may be stronger among\u2010lineage rate variation over time as to warrant using a relaxed clock model, but we anticipate that the evolutionary rates and TMRCA dates will be broadly similar to those estimated here. As the number of substitutions is still small, it is tempting to speculate that sequencing errors could have a considerable impact on the evolutionary rate and TMRCA date estimates. We removed three SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 genome sequences (ie, BetaCoV/Wuhan/IPBCAMS\u2010WH\u201002/2019, EPI_ISL_403931; BetaCoV/Shenzhen/SZTH\u2010001/2020, EPI_ISL_406592; BetaCoV/Shenzhen/SZTH\u2010004/2020, EPI_ISL_406595) with potential sequencing errors, but these may have less impact on the above estimates when more substitutions of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 are accumulated over time. We also expect that as more SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 genome sequences become available, the estimated 95% BCIs of the evolutionary rates and TMRCA dates will be narrower.",

This insertion constitutes an RRAR motif in the spike protein at the junction of S1 and S2 junction in the human SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus, after considering the next amino acid (R) of the unique peptide (PRRA) (Figure S6). Of note, the highly favored motifs for furin cleavage are Arg\u2010X\u2010(Arg/Lys)\u2010Arg (RXRR or RXKR), and the minimal motifs for furin cleavage can be RXXR.\n48\n We also note that some of the other coronaviruses have a furin motif in almost the same location in their spike proteins.\n49\n, \n50\n Lentiviruses have an RKXR (R, arginine; K, lysine; X, any amino acid) site between gp120 and gp41, cleaved by furin to convert gp160 into subunits.\n51\n, \n52\n, \n53\n, \n54\n Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that cleavage or lack of cleavage of the spike protein at this site could significantly impact host range and transmissibility.

Therefore, we concluded that the human SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus, which is responsible for the current outbreak of COVID\u201019, did not come directly from pangolins. However, due to the limited viral metagenomic data obtained from pangolins, we cannot exclude that other pangolins from China may contain coronaviruses that exhibit greater similarity to the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus.",
