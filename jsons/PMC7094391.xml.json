Under the influence of substances, including thrombin, collagen, epinephrine, vasopressin, platelet-activating factor, and arachidonic acid metabolites, released from sites of tissue injury, platelets are activated and undergo robust rheologic transformation (Fig 1\n). When components of the subendothelial matrix then become exposed to circulating blood, platelet glycoproteins and von Willebrand factor (vWF) mediate an intense adhesive process. Platelet aggregation firmly ensues, largely supported by the GP IIb/IIIa receptor, and these events are then ultimately reinforced by a potent milieu of vasoactive compounds secreted from the galvanized platelet offensive.8\n",

In atherosclerosis, for instance, activated platelets can release adhesive ligands such as P-selectin. P-selectin is capable of creating a phospholipid-rich platform that then facilitates the recruitment of mononuclear cells and lymphocytes to the atherosclerotic plaque.7 Platelet activation has been associated with enhanced cytokine expression in other inflammatory conditions, including acute coronary syndromes, coronary stent restenosis, and solid organ transplant rejection.12, 13\n",

Kirschenbaum and colleagues,42 for instance, showed that formation of these aggregates had a pronounced effect on altering blood rheology in patients with sepsis, a process that the investigators believed contributed significantly to impairments in perfusion. Platelets also may adhere directly to inflamed endothelial cells and promote secondary capture of toxic circulating leukocytes. This mechanism has been supported by several small studies in which targeted inhibition of platelet-specific ligands on neutrophils reliably attenuated sepsis-associated endothelial injury.29, 43 Circulating platelet-neutrophil complexes and platelet-stimulated neutrophil extracellular trap formation also can be seen in the patient with sepsis. These neutrophil extracellular traps are believed to represent a subset of activated neutrophils with enhanced ability to adhere, phagocytose, and produce injurious superoxide.43 Finally, other data suggest that lymphotoxicity and lymphoid cell apoptosis may result from sepsis-induced alterations in platelet mRNA profiles.44\n",

Perhaps the most well-validated strategy to reduce mortality is the use of low-tidal-volume ventilation,2 and, in fact, the use of injurious high-tidal-volume ventilation has been shown to upregulate both vWF and P-selectin expression.47 Using lung-protective positive pressure ventilation, however, is associated with decreased ADP- and collagen-mediated platelet aggregation.50 Nitric oxide, another therapy often used in ARDS/ALI despite limited data to support its routine use, has been shown to decrease platelet aggregation by reducing fibrinogen binding to the GP IIb/IIIa receptor.51 As well, the controversial use of corticosteroids in ARDS52 has been associated with decreased platelet activation and activity in some experimental models.53, 54 Although not suggesting that these therapies improved lung injury through their platelet-modifying effects alone, these data do support a biologic plausibility that should be considered when studying the impact of dysregulated platelet activity on patient outcomes (Fig 2\n).",

Targeted platelet depletion or disruption of platelet-neutrophil interactions in murine models of ARDS resulted in reduced neutrophil migration and permeability, improved alveolar gas exchange, and increased survival.41 Aspirin use in an experimental transfusion-related ALI model did not prevent neutrophil sequestration; however, the neutrophils that infiltrated the pulmonary parenchyma were rendered incapable of causing lung toxicity.82 Further study clearly is needed to build on these preliminary data in order to clarify the intriguing potential of therapeutic platelet targeting in lung injury populations.",

No longer are these anucleate cells considered merely executors of the thrombotic process but, instead, are clearly key contributors to the host immune response. Although initially adaptive, unregulated platelet activation during sepsis, ALI, and ARDS leads to organ hypoperfusion, pathologic tissue injury, and poor patient outcomes. Whether modulation of this platelet response will improve the high morbidity and mortality associated with these diseases remains to be seen. Small, nonrandomized clinical studies of antiplatelet strategies have yielded mixed results but should prompt additional investigation.",

Building on circumstantial evidence from trials of contemporary antiplatelet therapies, some investigators have begun to focus greater attention on the role of adenosine and its myriad of receptors on the pathobiology of inflammation. During conditions of high metabolic stress, as seen in acute tissue injury and sepsis for instance, extracellular adenosine concentrations often are markedly increased.83 Adenosine is believed to play an important role in preventing neutrophil infiltration into vulnerable tissue,84 and a growing body of data suggests a possible role for adenosine in modulating adaptive immune response to critical illness.",
