Worldwide, long\u2010term forest composition and forest species distributions are under pressure from continuing large\u2010scale anthropogenic effects. Because forest simulation models are ecosystem based, they can provide both predictions of forest response to these impacts and a consistent synthesis of the ecological processes involved (Rastetter 1996). Such properties make them a vital part of any assessment of ecosystem response to global change (Reynolds et al. 1996, Shugart and Smith 1996).",

This approach tracked the development of each individual plant throughout its life cycle, with forest dynamics simulated by calculating the competitive interrelationships among trees in a restricted area, similar to that resulting from the gap in a forest canopy formed by the death or removal of a large canopy tree. By simulating a sufficient number of gaps, the dynamics of the forest are reproduced (Yamamoto 1992). This concept is supported by various plant succession studies, which show that changes in a forest ecosystem may be described by averaging the growth dynamics in gaps of different successional ages (Watt 1947, Bray 1956, Curtis 1959, Forman and Godron 1981).",

New Zealand\u2019s small group of islands (landmass 270000 km2) have variations in climate, geology, and soil that offer a wider range of habitats than many much larger landmasses (Wardle 1984, Molloy 1988). The three main islands (North, South, and Stewart) span 1500 km (13\u00b0) of latitude and have a maritime climate, with sea level temperatures ranging from warm temperate in the north (mean annual temperature (MAT) \u223c 15\u00b0C) to cold temperate in the south (MAT \u223c 10\u00b0C). New Zealand is tectonically active, with mountain building continuing at rates of up to 12 mm/yr (Whitehouse 1988). About 60% of the land is >300 m above sea level, and 70% is defined as hilly or steep (Molloy 1988). The varied topography cuts across the prevailing westerly winds, modifying land temperatures and causing strong rainfall gradients. The North Island has a central volcanic plateau with an average elevation of 500 m and main axial mountain ranges running northeast to south. Rainfall exceeds 1600 mm/yr in these areas and can reach 6000 mm/yr. There are also sizable areas of lowlands and coastal plains. The South Island has a young mountain range running 700 km north to south. The many summits >3000 m create strongly differentiated climatic gradients. In the eastern lee of the South Island range, rainfall drops to a low of 300 mm/yr, whereas on the windward side in Westland and Fiordland, it may reach 12000 mm/yr near the ranges.",

Nothofagus (beech) species characterize many forest types, occurring either in pure associations (46% of the remaining forested area) or in mixed forest (22% of remaining forest area). Beech species predominate in mountain regions of both main islands. Their wide ecological ranges enable their frequent occurrence in montane zones as well as lowland areas. In the northern warmer areas (north of 38\u00b0 S), the conifer Agathis australis dominates the forests in association with a mixture of hardwoods, podocarp, and beech species. Further south, lowland forests are characterized by emergent, long\u2010lived, evergreen podocarp species Dacrydium, Podocarpus, and Prumnopitys. These are associated with a diverse group of broad\u2010leaved hardwoods (Beilschmiedia, Metrosideros, and Weinmannia), characteristic of the main canopy (Ogden et al. 1996).",

The young landscapes and generally infertile forest soils in New Zealand (Molloy 1988, Wardle 1991) similarly required models that relate soil nutrient status to species composition and forest stature (e.g., Aber et al. 1982, Pastor and Post 1986, Bonan 1990). We chose the LINKAGES gap model (Pastor and Post 1986, Post and Pastor 1996) because it included these ecosystem processes without excessive data requirements. It has explicit feedbacks between light, water, and nitrogen availability, and their effects on stand composition and productivity. Previous gap models have related soil nutrient status to tree growth by species\u2010specific sigmoid equations that reach maximum values at the highest reported basal area, or biomass, for a given region. The LINKAGES model eliminates these site\u2010specific maxima by explicitly simulating water and nutrient availability and using them to influence tree growth (Post and Pastor 1996). However, the model lacks some recent modifications in allometric relationships, growth equations, and spatially explicit modeling of the light environment (e.g., Leemans and Prentice 1987, Martin 1992, Pacala et al. 1993, Prentice et al. 1993, Bugmann 1996).

Therefore, we were careful to extend, rather than modify, the mechanisms of competition or nutrient cycling. This preserved the model\u2019s original ability to reproduce dynamics of the forests of eastern North America and allowed a comparison of results with LINKAGES.

The model simulates, on a yearly cycle, the establishment, growth, and mortality of all individual trees in a 1/12 ha plot (0.083 ha), adjusted by the effects of climate, soil properties, and competition. Plot size corresponds to the average gap created by a dominant tree in eastern North American forests (Shugart and West 1977). Initial diameter at breast height (dbh) is stochastically set between 1.27 cm and 1.42 cm. Monthly rainfall and temperature variables, together with soil moisture capacity and wilting point, determine available site moisture. As the canopy forms and develops, light availability to each tree changes, affecting growth rates and the establishment of new trees. Available soil nitrogen is initialized for the site and then determined annually by external inputs, losses due to leaching, and dynamics associated with processes of immobilization and mineralization during litter decomposition (Post and Pastor 1996). Available soil nitrogen then affects tree growth and stand composition, which, in turn, alters litter quantity and quality and modifies decomposition rates (Pastor and Post 1985).",

The clearest case is that of the long\u2010lived conifer Halocarpus biformis, with a highest recorded growth increment of 0.8 mm/yr (Wardle 1991), preventing LINKAGES from establishing it at all. Under LINKAGES, the widespread, dominant conifers of the Podocarpaceae with recorded maximum annual diameter increments <3 mm/yr also struggle to survive in slightly less than optimal conditions. Slow growth is common in the understory for other New Zealand species as well. Seedlings of Nothofagus species, for example, remain in a quiescent state (<1.35 m tall), making only limited growth for decades until an opportunity is provided by the death of canopy trees (Wardle 1984). Nothofagus fusca, normally one of the faster growing dominant species (Stewart and Rose 1990), may grow in diameter by only 0.8 mm/yr under a dense canopy, with 70% of the poles in a typical stand passing through this stage (Kirkland 1961). Baxter and Norton (1989) show a similar growth release behavior for Dacrydium cupressinum and Quintinia acutifolia, in which ring widths of young trees are <0.5 mm/yr under an intact canopy, but increase to widths of 2\u20134 mm/yr after the overstory trees are removed.",

The 2.5 mm/yr threshold was chosen by comparison against optimal growth increments recorded for a range of New Zealand tree species (G. M. J. Hall and D. Y. Hollinger, unpublished manuscript). Species with a maximum diameter increment exceeding 2.5 mm/yr will have, at some point, the same tests for slow growth as in LINKAGES, whereas those that never attain this increment have the 1 mm/yr fixed minimum waived.

Forest disturbances have been due to physical factors associated with steep mountain slopes, and include volcanism, periodic fire, forest dieback, windthrow, drought, flooding, and snow damage (Wardle 1984). We added a basic mechanism to LINKNZ to simulate disturbance. The type (wind or fire) and the mean disturbance return time can be set in the site parameters. The LINKNZ model will trigger that type of disturbance with a probability annually that is the reciprocal of the disturbance frequency. After windthrow, all trees on the plot are assumed to be dead and all biomass, including belowground root mass, is returned to the site for decomposition\u2013nutrient cycling. After fire, all trees are assumed to be dead and the larger biomass components are returned to the site. The biomass and N in foliage and twigs are presumed to be volatilized and lost from the site.",

To construct definitive tests of simulated forest dynamics, several stands would have to be monitored for long periods while they were returning to old\u2010growth forest. Even in well\u2010observed eastern North American forests, a lack of historical data on succession has been acknowledged (Pacala et al. 1993). In addition, Rastetter (1996) has noted that each alternative used to evaluate modeled ecosystem response to global change fails to provide a severe and crucial test. Partly, this is due to difficulties in locating past or present ecosystem states comparable to those expected under climate change. For instance, how can valid data be obtained for evaluating long\u2010term vegetation responses to increased CO2, when short\u2010term chamber experiments are still inconclusive? We adopt recent evaluation methods for forest gap models to evaluate the ability of the model under current climates, but acknowledge that theoretical difficulties remain.",

Our results, based solely on gap\u2010phase replacement dynamics inherent in the model, support the primary succession theory of Egler (1954) and the early belief (Cockayne 1928) that Agathis is successional to a climax podocarp forest (Figs. 1, 2A) and that strongly Agathis\u2010dominated forests would occur only in the first 400 yr after large\u2010scale disturbance. The gap size and frequencies produced by the model are a consequence of the comparative life history attributes set for the trees that occupy the site. Thus, long\u2010lived trees will produce gaps only infrequently; in the case of Agathis, this frequency is so low that there is sufficient time for the shade\u2010tolerant hardwoods and podocarps to become well established, reducing the likelihood that enough light would penetrate through the understory of a tree\u2010sized gap to permit abundant Agathis regeneration. In a study of Agathis treefall gaps, Ogden et al. (1987) found that Agathis established in only a few, enough to maintain a presence but not dominance. They estimated that, owing to its longevity (mean > 600 yr), Agathis could survive on any site up to 1500\u20132000 yr. The corresponding simulation (Fig. 2A), without large\u2010scale disturbance, shows Agathis declining from an initial dominance, but remaining a significant component of the forest for nearly 1600 yr.",

Our introduction of stochastic disturbance of this frequency into the dynamics of the model (Fig. 5A) resulted in stands where Agathis remains an important component of the forest. Without disturbance, Agathis biomass makes up \u223c44% of the total biomass at year 600 after most of the initial cohort have gone, declining to zero by year 1800 (Fig. 2A).

Cockayne (1926) suggested that this absence could be the result of insufficient time for beech to have recolonized the area since the end of the last glaciation (\u223c10000 yr BP). Our results for sites within the \u201cbeech gap,\u201d such as Franz Josef and Hokitika (data not shown), lend support to Cockayne\u2019s hypothesis. When beech is part of the available species pool, it can establish and become a permanent, if low\u2010biomass, component of the forest. Even when beech availability on the site was delayed 1000 yr to allow the forest to fully establish first, LINKNZ indicated that a small amount of beech could establish. This suggests that poor modes of dispersal in beech may play a more significant role than any total inability to compete. Wardle (1964) also suggests that New Zealand beech may compete less effectively with existing vegetation where the rainfall is high, such as on the west coast, than in the drier conditions to the east of the axial ranges. The LINKNZ model supports this contention, because the simulations show that beech requires a longer period of time to become established in the \u201cbeech gap\u201d sites than on the drier, cooler east side of the South Island in the Craigieburn Range (compare Fig. 3B, C with Fig. 3F, G).",

Ogden (1988) describes the role of synchronized cohort mortality in the dynamics of beech and how disturbance promotes Nothofagus fusca establishment. When we included beech in the species pool and introduced wind\u2010blow disturbances (300\u2010yr mean return time) to the simulations at Franz Josef located in the \u201cbeech gap,\u201d beech biomass increased by a factor of 5 to reach \u223c25% of the total; N. menziesii biomass doubled, and the fast\u2010growing N. fusca established and attained >12% of total biomass. By contrast, a disturbance regime that removed organic matter from the site inhibited beech species establishment and produced a more typical low\u2010elevation hardwood\u2013podocarp forest. Ogden (1988) notes that N. fusca prefers higher fertility sites and would be expected to have difficulty establishing. At this low\u2010elevation, low\u2010fertility site, the model predicts that other species, such as the common hardwood Weinmannia racemosa, would capture the area and lead to the establishment of large, dominant podocarps such as Dacrydium cupressinum.\n",

An ecological interpretation of this behavior is that, as the fast\u2010growing, light\u2010demanding, even\u2010aged stands of N. solandri var. cliffortioides thin, they become replaced by relatively even\u2010aged stands of the shade\u2010tolerant N. menziesii.

Both species have wide, overlapping soil fertility, soil moisture, and climatic tolerances (Wardle 1984, Benecke and Allen 1992; G. M. J. Hall and D. Y. Hollinger, unpublished manuscript). In New Zealand, these species form almost continuous alpine and subalpine forests throughout the axial mountain ranges of both main islands. Wardle (1984) found that in mixed stands, dense, small\u2010diameter (young) Nothofagus menziesii usually occur in conjunction with large\u2010diameter (old) N. solandri var. cliffortioides and, conversely, stands with low numbers of large N. menziesii trees often have high densities of young N. solandri var. cliffortioides trees. Ogden (1988) further suggested that N. solandri var. cliffortioides will gradually be replaced by N. menziesii unless the stand is severely disturbed. In fact, the Craigieburn forests are essentially monocultures of N. solandri var. cliffortioides, with few other canopy species. Disturbance events such as wind, earthquake\u2010triggered landslips, and heavy snowfall (Wardle 1984) frequently disrupt these subalpine and alpine forests on the eastern slopes of the South Island axial range. Age\u2013diameter distributions indicate that stands may be severely damaged by gales at periods of \u223c120\u2013150 yr, and stands suffer minor damage at intervals of 20\u201330 yr (Wardle 1984, Jane 1986, Harcombe et al. 1998). When we investigated the influence of disturbance on the dynamics and biomass of N. solandri var. cliffortioides\u2013N. menziesii forests by adding stochastic disturbance (blowdown of whole\u2010plot biomass) to the dynamics of the model, the counter\u2010cyclical pattern of succession was removed (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, as the mean interval between disturbances decreased, the relative percentage and absolute amount of N. menziesii in the resulting stands decreased from a 70% dominance to <20% for mean intervals greater than one event every 120 yr (Fig. 7). This model behavior provides support for Wardle\u2019s (1984) conclusion that stability favors N. menziesii and disturbance favors N. solandri var. cliffortioides, and suggests why N. solandri var. cliffortioides can be so dominant in disturbance\u2010prone subalpine forests.",

By incorporating a simple disturbance regime into the model, we also supported the hypothesis that large\u2010scale disturbance is of importance in shaping the dynamics and current composition of New Zealand forests (Veblen and Stewart 1982, Ogden 1985, Wardle 1991).",
