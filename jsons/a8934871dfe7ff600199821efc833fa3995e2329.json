Overall, the case-fatality rate of COVID-19 so far is much lower than either SARS (9.6%) or MERS (34.5%). 10 Here, we summarized common and discrete features of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to its two predecessors (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) in genetics, epidemiology, clinical features, and further discussed challenges for diagnosis and special control measures for COVID-19.",

Of note, eight mutations were found in the spike surface glycoprotein, especially three mutations (D 354 , Y 364 , and F 367 ) located in the spike surface glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD), which suggested SARS-CoV-2 may rapidly evolve to evade immune response and adapt to other hosts in the future. SARS-CoV-2 share 79% nt sequence identity to SARS-CoV and around 50% to MERS-CoV. 2 However, the seven conserved replicase domains in ORF1ab (used for CoV species classification) of SARS-CoV-2 are 94.6% identical to SARS-CoV, implying the two belong to same species. 1, 2 The receptor-binding protein spike (S) gene of SARS-CoV-2 is highly divergent to all previously described SARSr-CoVs with less than 75% nt sequence identity to except a 93.1% nt identity to RaTG13. Homology modeling revealed SARS-CoV-2 had a similar RBD structure to that of SARS-CoV. 11 Further study showed SARS-CoV-2 uses the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, as SARS-CoV, not CD26 as MERS-CoV. 2 Structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy revealed SARS-CoVs protein binds ACE2 with 10 to 20 folds higher affinity than SARS-CoV, 14 which suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may be more infectious to human than SARS-CoV.",

A novel coronavirus was identified as the causative pathogen, 1-6 provisionally named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO). On 11 February 2020, WHO named this novel coronavirus pneumonia as \"COVID-19\" (coronavirus disease 2019). On the basis of phylogeny, taxonomy, and established practice, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses formally recognizes this virus as a sister to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and renamed it as SARS-CoV-2. 7 SARS-CoV-2 belongs to species of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and genus Betacoronavirus. 2 COVID-19 rapidly triggered a global health emergency alert and spread to 46 countries by 27 February 2020. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infects humans. Like SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for lower respiratory infection and can cause acute respiratory distress syndromes (ARDS). Other human coronaviruses (HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1) are responsible for upper respiratory infections and common cold. 8 By 27 February 2020, according to open data from China CDC as shown in",

Phylodynamic analysis based on 52 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 strains sampled in different countries publicly available at GISAID showed the estimated mean evolutionary rate was 7.8 \u00d7 10 \u22124 subs/site/year (range 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u22124 to 15 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ), which was in line with that of SARS and MERS, and the mean time of the most recent common ancestor was 73 days.",

SARS-CoV-2 appears to be more infectious than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV based on R 0 values calculated at the early stage of this outbreak. Majority of infected individuals with no or mild symptoms can release viruses and spread viruses to others, which is extremely challenging for preventing the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, intense surveillance is vital for preventing sustained transmission. Active interventions including nutrition supplement, symptomatic treatment, and antiviral treatment are critical for mild patients as well as severe patients. Finally, prophylactic vaccination is highly demanded for future prevention of emerging coronavirus-related epidemics or pandemics.

Many methods are applied to recognize source of infections (laboratory confirmed patients, suspected infected persons, and closely contacted persons), including community registration, tracing suspected carrier by cell phones. Those evaluated at moderate/high risk of exposure are encouraged to report conditions daily. General medical wards were used to collectively monitor and treat mild patients.42,48 Therapeutics of COVID-19 primarily include symptomatic treatments and antiviral therapies. Early supportive interventions are critical for treating mild patients including nutrient supplements, oxygen therapy, Chinese herbal medicine, and antibacterial therapy. Patients infected with COVID-19 are mostly middle aged and elderly generally with low resistance to infection.42 Supportive treatments are necessary for patients with mild symptoms at the early stage of infection.For critically ill patients, high-flow oxygen therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, glucocorticoid therapy, and administration of convalescent plasma are applied.34,49 There are several suggested antiviral treatments: lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, interferon-\u03b1, chloroquine phosphate, and Abidor. It is not recommended to use three or more antiviral drugs above simultaneously.34,50,51 Combinational use of lopinavir, ritonavir, and ribavirin in the treatment of SARS was reported to be associated with better outcome.52 It was previously reported that chloroquine could inhibit SARS-CoV53 and was tested for treating COVID-19 in clinical trials in China. Recently, several studies suggested remdesivir effectively inhibit RNA viruses (including SARS/MERS-CoV/2019-nCoV) infection.51,54,55 Remdesivir was used on the first patient in the United States and showed promising results.31 Currently, three clinical trials were registered for testing remdesivir on the treatment of COVID-19 (http://clinicaltrials.gov). In addition, a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor EK1 targeting the HR1 domain of HCoV spike was reported to have the potential to treat COVID-19.56 Convalescent sera were used for treating critically ill patients and show some effects.57 Recent report indicated that transmission may occur from individuals with no symptoms or from convalescents.42,58 It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 will stay around for some time and even coevolve with its hosts. Due to uncertainty of clinical spectrum of virus carriers, vaccination is highly recommended for susceptible populations, especially for those with comorbidities (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and cancers). Vaccines based on S protein, T cell epitopes, and RBD have been studied for SARS and MERS.56,[59][60][61] Recently, an oral vaccine based on yeastexpressed S protein developed by a group of scientists in Tianjing University of China provoked a lot of interests after it was reported by Jingyun News. However, it needs to be further tested in clinical trials. On 24 February 2020, Moderna, a pharmaceutical company in the United States announced that its experimental messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine, known as mRNA-1273, was ready for human testing and the initial batch of the vaccine were shipped to US government researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. We have reasons to believe that vaccines would be a way to prevent viral infection because convalescent sera could improve conditions of critically ill patients.",
