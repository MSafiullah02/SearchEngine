The Frankfurt-1 strain of SARS-CoV was kindly provided by Dr John Ziebuhr (University of W\u00fcrzburg, W\u00fcrzburg, Germany), through Dr Fumihiro Taguchi ( National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan). For the infectivity assay, Vero E6 cells were seeded in a 96-well microplate (4 \u00d7 10 5 cells/ml, 0\u00b71 ml/well) and, after overnight culture at 37 \u00b0 C in 5% CO 2 /air, the cells were inoculated with serial 10-fold dilutions of the virus stock solution (0\u00b71 ml/well, five wells per dilution). On day 3 of culture, virus infectivity [the tissue culture infectivity dose 50% (TCID 50 /ml), log 10 ] was calculated by using Karber's method [2] .",

However, its infectivity in the anti-thrombin III preparation persisted, despite heating for 30 min at 60 \u00b0 C, although the same amount of heating inactivated the virus in the other three preparations (Fig. 1) . This result was confirmed by an independent experiment (data not shown). Furthermore, when Frankfurt-1 was inoculated into the solutions containing the stabilizer alone (without protein), 30 min of heating inactivated the virus to below the detection limit in all four products (data not shown), suggesting that the combination of the blood product preparation and its stabilizer affected the heat sensitivity of the virus. Rabenau and his colleagues also conducted experiments using the SARS-CoV FFM-1 strain. As in our study, they found that while the virus was stabilized by heating at 56 \u00b0 C for 30 min in the presence of 20% FBS, it was inactivated at 60 \u00b0 C in the presence and absence of 20% FBS [3] . In this context therefore we must take into consideration the combination of the plasma products and the stabilizer. The Frankfurt-1 strain was inoculated, at either 10% (v/v, solid line) or 1% (v/v, broken line), into in-process solutions of a heat-treated/polyethylene glycol-treated intravenous immunoglobulin preparation (\u1b5c), an antithrombin III preparation (\u1b61), a haptoglobin preparation (), and a 25% human serum albumin preparation (\u1b79), each collected immediately before liquid heat treatment. The virus in these products was then treated at 60 \u00b0C for up to 2 h. The virus was also inoculated (10% v/v) into minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and then heat treated as a control (x). The data shown represent the virus infectivities remaining after heat treatment.",
