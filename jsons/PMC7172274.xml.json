            "text": "Coronaviruses belonging to the Coronavirinae subfamily are traditionally divided into three genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus, based on antigenic relationships (Woo et al., 2010). To these traditional classifications, another novel genus, Deltacoronavirus, was recently added, which is found in diverse host species, including some mammalian and avian species, as described by the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses (Dong et al., 2007; Chan et al., 2013). In a large-scale molecular surveillance study performed in Hong Kong, additional deltacoronaviruses were identified in many avian species and swine (Woo et al., 2012). Thereafter, porcine/swine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV/SDCV) was first detected in pigs with diarrhoea in Ohio in 2014, and it has since also been identified in other states of the United States (U.S.) (Marthaler et al., 2014a, Marthaler et al., 2014b; Wang et al., 2014a, Wang et al., 2014b). PDCoVs have also recently been detected in Asian countries such as Korea, China, Thailand and Laos (Lee and Lee, 2014; Dong et al., 2015; Janetanakit et al., 2016; Lorsirigool et al., 2016; Zhang, 2016). PDCoV is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus, and its genome contains the following elements in the order: 5'untranslated region (UTR), open reading frame 1a/1b (ORF1a/1b), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nonstructural protein 6 (NS6), nucleocapsid (N), nonstructural protein 7 (NS7), and 3'UTR (Woo et al., 2012).",

In contrast, we found that diarrhoeic faecal samples from several swine farms have often been negative for PED virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), other enteric viruses (rotaviruses and enteroviruses) since 2014. Some previous studies have reported that PEDV and PDCoV could be simultaneously and frequently detected in faecal samples from pigs with diarrhoea in the regions of the U.S. in which PEDV was epidemic (Marthaler et al., 2014a, Marthaler et al., 2014b; Li et al., 2014). In addition, three research groups demonstrated that PDCoV is enteropathogenic in pigs in experimental infections (Chen et al., 2015; Jung et al., 2015, Jung et al., 2016; Ma et al., 2015). Therefore, these findings suggest the possibility that PDCoV is one of the major pathogens, in addition to PEDV, causing outbreaks of diarrhoea in multiple swine farms in Japan.",

Eight amplicons were pooled in equal amounts, and analysed using next-generation sequencing technology (Ion Torrent PGM; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The consensus genome sequences of the seven Japanese PDCoV strains were determined with reference to the complete genomes of the 17 U.S., two Hong Kong, and one Korea PDCoV strains assigned previously in GenBank.

This detection rate of PDCoV-positive samples is similar to that (22%) observed in a survey of porcine samples collected in the U.S. in January\u2013February 2014 (Marthaler et al., 2014b). Because we have no detailed information of swine herds which collected diarrhoeic samples, our data cannot deny the possibility that these diarrhoeas might be caused by other pathogens (bacteria and parasites), but suggests that PDCoV would associated with these diarrhoeas. Moreover, our data also suggests that PDCoV can infect into all age groups as similar as PEDV (Saif et al., 2012). Particularly, our survey revealed the highest positive detection rates of PDCoV in sows. Because pregnant pigs are stressful, and decrease self-immunity, sows are susceptible to pathogens around them. In fact, the report for first detection of PDCoV in U.S. exhibited that the U.S. PDCoVs were detected from sows with watery diarrhoea (Wang et al., 2014a, Wang et al., 2014b). In field observation, it reports that sows showed not only severe diarrhoea but also vomiting and anorexia (in our personal communication). These findings suggest that PDCoV might be susceptible to older pig than piglets. However, its hypothesis would need to examine clinical signs and dynamics of viral distribution in older pigs experimentally inoculated with PDCoV in future.",

High levels of PDCoV genomic RNA were identified from intestinal tissues, from the duodenum to rectum, in the PDCoV-inoculated group at 4 DPI necropsy. Lower viral genomic copies were also detected in the livers and MLNs of PDCoV-inoculated piglets using PDCoV-specific real-time RT-PCR at 4 DPI. The presence of virus in these tissues might mean that PDCoV genomic RNA is transferred via the blood stream, as piglets inoculated with PDCoV isolate showed the peak viral shedding in sera at 4 DPI. In addition, the PDCoV-inoculated piglets necropsied at 4 DPI showed positive IHC staining for PDCoV in enterocytes in the proximal jejunum to colon, particularly the middle jejunum to ileum. In contrast, all piglets necropsied at 7 DPI in the PDCoV-inoculated group mainly exhibited viral genomic copies and IHC antigens at high levels in the caecum and colon according to PDCoV-specific PCR and microscopic observation, respectively. Our findings suggest that the PDCoV isolate was widely distributed in the small and large intestines and mainly propagated in the middle jejunum to ileum until 4 DPI, at which point it was transmitted to and propagated in the caecum to colon. These data, especially the viral distribution in the intestines at 7 DPI, differed from those obtained from conventional piglets (5-day-old) inoculated with a PDCoV isolate cultured in ST cells in a previous report (Chen et al., 2015).",
