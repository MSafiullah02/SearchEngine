Briefly, reductive alkylation of 3 with benzaldehyde and NaBH3CN led to 6 in 59% while reductive alkylation of 3 and 6 with formaldehyde and NaBH3CN furnished 7 and 11 in 55% and 75% yield, respectively. Hydrogenolysis of amine 7 led to secondary amine 8 in 74% yield. Alternatively, 8 was obtained by reaction of 3 with methyl chloroformate followed by LiAlH4-mediated reduction of the intermediate carbamate, in 28% overall yield. Alkylation of 3 with propargyl bromide led to a mixture of 9 and 10 that were separated by column chromatography. Finally, alkylation of 3 with 1,5-dibromopentane gave the piperidine derivative 12 in 35% yield (Scheme 1\n).",

The disease is endemic in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, with upwards of 60 million people at risk. A process of antigenic variation prevents elimination of the parasite by the immune system, and the prospects of developing a vaccine are thought to be remote. New drugs against HAT are therefore a major priority. Drugs currently available against HAT are characterized by problems including toxicity, limited efficacy, cost and the need to administer under medical supervision.",

Cells were loaded with 6 \u03bcM Fura-2 AM (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes) for 45 min. Afterwards, the coverslip was mounted on a quartz cuvette containing a Locke-Hepes buffer using a special holder. Measurements were performed using a PerkinElmer LS-50B fluorometer equipped with a fast-filter accessory, under mild agitation and at 37 \u00b0C. Analysis from each sample was recorded real-time during 1200 s. After stimulation with NMDA or glutamate (100 \u03bcM, in the presence of 10 \u03bcM glycine), increasing cumulative concentrations of the compound to be tested were added. The percentages of inhibition at every tested concentration were analyzed using a non-linear regression curve fitting (variable slope) by using the software GraphPad Prism 4.0.",
