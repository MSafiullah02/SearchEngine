            "text": "Biological medicinal products for both human and veterinary use and the cell substrates used for their manufacture are currently tested for bovine and porcine adventitious viruses due to the widespread use of bovine serum and porcine or bovine trypsin in cell culture. Currently, testing for bovine and porcine adventitious agents is performed in compliance with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulations for veterinary products as specified in the 9CFR 113 regulations (9CFR). These regulations are intended to ensure that veterinary agents of concern are not introduced into new populations of animals (e.g., into new geographic regions or into previously unexposed herds or flocks), in order to prevent veterinary epidemics and protect the U.S. cattle and swine industries. Cell-culture derived vaccines for human use were developed in the 1950\u2019s. Since fetal calf serum and bovine or porcine trypsin were used in cell culture, the 9CFR tests developed for veterinary use to screen for viruses that can infect cattle and swine were implemented by the authorities regulating human vaccines. However, many viruses not of significant concern to the cattle and swine industry are not addressed by the 9CFR testing. Today, over half a century after cell culture-derived vaccines were initially developed, the human biologics industry is still using the methods specified in the 9CFR regulations for testing FBS and porcine trypsin. When these tests are applied to bovine and porcine-derived raw materials used to manufacture products intended for human use, they may or may not detect the most relevant agents of concern for biological products for human use. The USDA regulations call for testing bovine serum for at least nine viruses; seven are tested specifically by immunofluorescence upon exposure and amplification in susceptible cells, and at least two more are tested by more general read-outs (hemagglutination/hemadsorption or cytopathic effect) upon exposure and amplification in susceptible cells. In addition, the USDA regulations require testing of porcine trypsin for porcine parvovirus by immunofluorescence upon exposure and amplification in susceptible cells.",

However, these practices vary by manufacturer. In the absence of a consistent procedure for processing, the worst case in terms of potential contamination was assumed; i.e., that any virus worldwide that could contaminate bovine serum or porcine trypsin and has human host range is a potential contaminant. While this assumption is a stringent one, in fact, risk mitigation procedures can and should begin at the manufacturer of the animal-derived material and at the collection abattoirs. Regulatory agencies expect manufacturers of human biologicals to regularly audit their suppliers of serum, trypsin, and other animal-derived materials, to assure that proper risk mitigation procedures are followed.",

Similarly, the production of porcine trypsin uses huge numbers of pancreases that are extracted to produce a lot (batch) of trypsin. One infected animal may contaminate an entire batch/lot and the sensitivity of current testing may not be adequate to detect diluted contaminants. The limitations of testing for viruses in pooled products have been amply demonstrated in the human blood industry, and introduction of the mini-pool testing approach has led to increased sensitivity of detection and thereby increased safety for human recipients of these products. An additional safety concern for bovine serum and porcine trypsin is whether equipment cleaning between processing of animal-derived material lots is adequate to prevent cross-contamination.",

Searching for zoonotic bovine and porcine viruses was assumed not to be adequate for this study because biological products are frequently injected, bypassing the normal barriers to infection. Therefore, human host range was defined by the presence of any of the following: natural infection [including laboratory accidents], detection of antibodies (with or without disease manifestation), or the ability to infect human cells in culture.

One difficulty was that often information was obtained in reference to a genus or group of viruses (e.g., hantaviruses) but specific information on individual viruses was lacking. Also, some viruses, such as Chikungunya and Powassan, were present in vectors (mosquitoes and ticks) that feed on cattle but no direct evidence of bovine host range could be found.
