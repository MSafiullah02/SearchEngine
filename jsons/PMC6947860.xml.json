The development of clinical trial registries (such as clinicaltrials.gov) [9, 10], the exponential increase in journals publishing trial protocols, results and secondary studies, and growing support for data-sharing policies [11, 12] have created an open research environment of transparency and accountability. Furthermore, the publication of reporting guidelines (such as CONSORT and SPIRIT) [4, 13\u201315] have served to facilitate the transition between research and reporting to ensure standardisation and ease of readability.",

The search was peer reviewed by members of the study team, including a second (senior) information specialist (RA-B). The full search strategy is provided in Additional file 1. On May 7, 2018, we searched the Web of Science (WoS) (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, Penn., United States) by using PubMed IDs (PMIDs) from the PubMed/MEDLINE searches.

We also used the WoS to determine the extent to which each article had been cited in the scientific peer-review literature using the \u201ctimes cited\u201d number (that is, the number of times a publication has been cited by other publications). Two researchers (FC-L, RA-B) independently verified the data to minimise potential information errors. A process of normalisation was conducted by two researchers to bring together the different names of an author or country and the keywords (further details are available in Additional file 2). Specifically, one researcher (AA-A) checked the names by which an individual author appeared in two or more different forms (for example, \u201cJohn McMurray\u201d or \u201cJohn J. McMurray\u201d or \u201cJohn J.V. McMurray\u201d) using coincidence in that author\u2019s place(s) of work as the basic criterion for normalisation (for example, University of Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom) [31], and a second researcher (FC-L or RA-B) verified the data.

The main goal in topical analyses is to understand the topical distribution of a dataset, i.e. what topics are covered and how much of each topic is covered in a scientific discipline [32]. The most frequently used keywords were identified for the most prolific journals (with at least 1000 articles). Based on the most frequently used keywords (with at least 500 articles), a word cloud was created from text that the user provides and more emphasis was placed on words that appear with greater frequency in the source text. A \u201cco-words network\u201d was created to illustrate the co-occurrence of highly frequent words in the articles (applying a threshold of 100 articles in collaboration). The network analysis was carried out with the use of PAJEK (University of Ljubljana, Slovenia) [33], a software package for large network analysis that is free for non-commercial use to construct network graphs.

We hypothesize that different publishing patterns between journals may potentially reflect editorial policies and/or preferences, with some general medicine journals (such as The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine) and specialty journals (such as Journal of Clinical Oncology and Circulation), being more interested in and/or promoting the publication of RCTs. In contrast, a substantial number of these articles are behind publication paywalls (very few of the medical journals in our study sample are Open Access), and thus, research results may not be accessible to a large fraction of the scientific community and society as a whole, including clinicians (and patients) who may want them to help inform their clinical practice.",

However, the scientific community is centred on a nucleus of scientists from Western countries, with the most intense global collaborations taking place among the United States, United Kingdom and Canada.

Difficulties in healthcare, education and research systems, information access and communication, language barriers and economic and institutional instability all represent challenges (and clear disadvantages) for productivity in low- and middle-income regions. In addition, restrictions and difficulties in conducting clinical research in resource-poor situations result in the exclusion of many of these countries from the planning, conduct and publication of RCTs [67\u201369]. As might be expected, our results support previous findings that low- and middle-income countries [31, 70, 71] had minimal contributions in articles published in major medical journals. For example, a previous study [70] showed that most of the authors of original papers published in five high-impact general medical journals (including The New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet, JAMA, The BMJ and Annals of Internal Medicine) were more frequently affiliated with institutions in the same country as the journal. To address some of these problems, scientists, institutions and funders should promote collaborations (beyond historical, cultural and political factors) to share knowledge, expertise and innovative methodologies for clinical research. This may involve partnerships with Western countries to support capacity and resource development and research training.",

The large relative productivity in general internal medicine, cardiology and oncology may be explained by the important role of randomised evidence to novel treatments and preventive strategies for these chronic diseases. In line with previous research [72\u201375], most of these highly cited RCTs addressed interventions for burdensome conditions that are health priorities in Western countries [76, 77]. Funding of (international, collaborative) RCTs may come from varying sources including commercial and non-commercial sponsors. However, previous analyses of RCT-related articles published in high-IF journals have suggested that study sponsors may influence how RCTs are designed, conducted and reported, sometimes serving financial rather than public interests [78]. Given that research funding is often restricted, the scientific community is responsible for using the available resources most efficiently when exploring research priorities to afford knowledge users and population health needs [76, 77, 79, 80].",

This is in direct contrast to recent studies that have identified a gender gap in research publications [81\u201384]. For example, a previous study [84] showed that women in first authorship positions increased from 27% in 1994 to 37% in 2014 in leading medical journals (including Annals of Internal Medicine, JAMA Internal Medicine, The BMJ, JAMA, The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine), but progress has plateaued or declined since 2009.

            "text": "Several limitations exist in our study. First, we characterised the knowledge structures generated by a large number of articles published in major medical journals that are included in the WoS database. However, our results are limited to a subset of all clinical-trial-related articles published in 40 leading medical journals. We suspect that these articles represent those that have great implications for clinical practice and that are relevant to clinical practice guidelines and healthcare regulators. Although the publication production analysed has been drawn from an exhaustive analysis of the biomedical literature, possibly, the search missed some relevant articles (and journals). Some reports may be published in journals without being indexed as RCTs, making them difficult to identify. Second, as in many bibliometric analyses, the normalisation of the different names of an author, country and funding sources is fundamentally important to avoiding potential errors. We conducted a careful manual validation of the references and textual data to avoid typographical, transcription and/or indexing errors. However, we recognize this procedure does not assure complete certainty. Third, the affiliation addresses of authors do not necessarily reflect the country where the research was conducted or the research funding source. Fourth, topical analysis that extracts a set of unique keywords, word profiles and co-words may indicate intellectual organization in publication production, albeit with inherent limitations [85, 86]. Fifth, the use of citation analysis carries some problems [87\u201391]. A potential length time-effect bias exists, which puts the more recent articles at a disadvantage. In addition, the biomedical literature is rich in barriers and motivations for publication and citation preferences [87], including self-citation (bias towards one\u2019s own work) [88], language bias (bias towards publishing and citing English articles), omission bias (bias whereby competitors are purposely not cited), and selective reporting and publication bias (bias in which \u201cnegative\u201d results are withheld from publication and citation) [89\u201392]. In addition, citations are also treated as equal regardless of whether research is being cited for its positive contribution to the field or because it is being criticized. Finally, our methods represent only a mapping approach, which could be complemented further by more detailed analyses such as by examining the content (e.g. differences in journal or author characteristics between publicly funded and industry-funded studies, designs/methodology, etc.), the reporting and the reproducible research practices through research of research (\u201cmeta-research\u201d) studies [92\u201398].",
