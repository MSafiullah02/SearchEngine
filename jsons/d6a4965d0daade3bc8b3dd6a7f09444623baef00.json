The mild patients maybe asymptomatic.Moderate patients may exhibit symptoms of fever, nonproductive cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia; most of them appear to have a good prognosis. In contrast, some patients may develop severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ failure [7] [8] [9] [10] . Importantly, in critically ill patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection is also associated with inflammatory cytokine storm 11, 12 , which is mainly characterized by elevated plasma concentration of interleukins 6 (IL-6).",

A recent study showed that the viral load in respiratory specimens of symptomatic patients was similar to that of asymptomatic patients 16 , implying that the viral load in respiratory specimens may not objectively reflect the disease severity. Serum SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA (termed as RNAaemia by the authors in a recent study) was detected in 15% of the COVID-19 patients 8 , but the relevant characterizations are still lacking. In particular, it is unclear whether RNAaemia can be considered as a prognostic indicator, especially for severe or critically ill patients.",

Therefore, the combination of the IL-6 level and serum viral RNA Ct-value may be regarded as an effective marker for standard clinical measures to predict impending adverse outcomes with high accuracy.

Notably, the IL-6R monoclonal antibody (Tocilizumab)-directed COVID-19 therapy has been used in the clinical trial in China (No.ChiCTR2000029765). And it has recently been incorporated into COVID-19 management guidelines generated in China and Italy. Our data strongly supported this notion, but the efficacy of IL-6 monoclonal antibody-directed therapy remains to be fully evaluated. Besides, our observations also indicate that the combination of antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatments may be important for critically ill COVID-19 patients. Therefore, Baricitinib, a powerful inhibitor of the IL6/JAK/STAT signaling pathway and the clathrin-mediated endocytosis, may be effective against the consequences of elevated cytokine levels and SARS-CoV-2 infection in severe COVID-19 patients 22, 23 .",
