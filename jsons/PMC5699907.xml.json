Planned readmissions within 30 days of discharge were identified using the CMS Planned Readmission Algorithm.32 If the first readmission after discharge was planned, then no readmission was attributed to that hospitalization and any subsequent unplanned readmission was not counted as a readmission.32 We excluded hospitals with fewer than 10 index admissions for elderly Medicare patients or younger patients for each condition to improve the reliability of hospital 30-day RSRRs (Supplementary Figures 1 and 2, available online).",

For example, we examined whether a hospital's 30-day RSRR for heart failure was associated with the risk of readmission for acute myocardial infarction or pneumonia in younger patients. We hypothesized that the risk of readmission in younger patients for a specific condition would not be significantly associated with readmission rates in elderly Medicare patients for nonidentical conditions. However, if a relationship were to exist, it may suggest that hospital strategies targeting the reduction of readmissions for a specific condition may have broader effects across conditions. First, we identified hospitals with estimates of 30-day RSRRs for all 3 conditions. Next, we fit hierarchical regression models as described but included all three 30-day RSRRs as covariates of interest. The dependent variable was 30-day unplanned readmission among younger patients for the acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia cohorts. A P value <.05 was considered statistically significant. All data management and statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 14.2 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Tex).",

Compared with elderly Medicare beneficiaries, younger patients had lower readmission rates after hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction (8.5% vs 14.9%; P < .001) and pneumonia (13.7% vs 16.1%; P < .001). However, younger patients had higher rates of readmission after heart failure hospitalizations compared with elderly patients (21.4% vs 20.7%; P < .001).

Among this subgroup, we examined the association of 30-day RSRRs for all 3 conditions on the risk of readmission for hospitalizations of younger patients in the acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia cohorts (Table 3\n). A hospital's 30-day RSRR for heart failure was significantly associated with the risk of readmission in younger patients across all 3 conditions, whereas 30-day RSRRs for acute myocardial infarction were significantly associated with the risk of readmission for acute myocardial infarction and heart failure but not pneumonia. A hospital's 30-day RSRR for pneumonia was significantly associated with the risk of readmission in younger patients for pneumonia only, not acute myocardial infarction or heart failure (Table 3).",

            "text": "Our study should be interpreted in the context of the following study design issues. First, because of data limitations in the NRD, we were unable to account for complete measures of clinical and socioeconomic risk in our models.47, 48, 49 Thus, residual confounding due to both elderly and younger patients being sicker at some hospitals remains an important concern as with most observational studies. Second, we were unable to use the specific case-mix adjustment method used by CMS for estimation of 30-day RSRRs for HRRP and Hospital Compare.32 This method of risk-adjustment requires 12 months of claims data before admission, which was not available in this dataset. However, as in prior work, we used Elixhauser comorbidities for case-mix adjustment50; the discrimination of our models compared similarly to models used by CMS.21, 22, 23 Third, we did not have data available on vital status among patients who were not readmitted. Therefore, we were unable to account for the competing risk of death after discharge. However, most operational initiatives for programs targeted toward readmission consider mortality and readmission as separate outcomes. Fourth, there are important limitations of the NRD that deserve specific mention. The NRD includes only hospitalizations from community hospitals as defined by the American Hospital Association; therefore, admissions to federal hospitals such as the Veterans Affairs health systems are not included. Readmissions to hospitals in different states from the index hospitalization are not captured because the NRD is a compilation of various State Inpatient Databases. Also, readmissions when the discharge date occurred in 2015 were not captured. These limitations of the dataset may have led to a modest underestimation of the actual number of readmissions that occurred. Finally, we also recognize the limitations regarding our 30-day RSRR calculations due to the availability of 11 months of data in the NRD compared with the 3 years of historical data used in the CMS measures. This leads to the potential of measurement error in our 30-day RSRR calculations. Although there is no method to compare the hospital-specific RSRRs we estimated with Hospital Compare because of the de-identified nature of the NRD, our national observed readmission rates were largely comparable. Specifically, our 30-day observed readmission rates for elderly Medicare beneficiaries for acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and pneumonia were 14.9%, 20.7%, and 16.1%, respectively, whereas currently on Hospital Compare they are 16.8%, 21.9%, and 17.1%, respectively.51 Overall, our calculated rates were modestly lower than the reported readmission rates on Hospital Compare that we suspect are due to the inclusion of generally healthier Medicare Advantage patients.",
