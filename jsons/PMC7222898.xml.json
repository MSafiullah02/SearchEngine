The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have released guidance for the recognition of symptoms that warrant further investigation. Cross-pathway referral for these cancers allows both general medical practitioners (GMPs) and general dental practitioners (GDPs) to refer patients to be seen within two weeks by a specialist secondary care consultant in an oral maxillofacial cancer unit. Despite this, the positive diagnosis percentages of these cancers after referral remains very low. This low percentage is a promising variable on a patient level; however, it highlights an area of education for the wider team. Additionally, when compared with neighbouring European countries, the mortality one year post-diagnosis is lower in the UK. This calls into question the appropriateness of the urgent two-week wait (2ww) referral pathway for these cancers and its efficiency in triaging patients from primary care to secondary care.",

His review showed that there has been an increase in the number of referrals, without an increase in the number of diagnoses, which can potentially put immense burden on already busy secondary care departments. Langton's study further demonstrated a 60% increase in referrals between 2001-2004, which resulted in departments being unable to see patients within the two-week timeframe.6 In terms of patient experience, the 2ww was very beneficial as patients felt that they were being seen quickly and thus felt more in control of their diagnosis.6",

Roy et al. questioned whether the increase in referral numbers could be due to the fact that not many practitioners will see this type of cancer or have had the education, training or exposure to it; therefore, they will be more likely to refer for any symptoms suggestive of HNC. Their research further highlighted that some referrals had been made without consulting the NICE guidelines at all.9",

Hong et al. demonstrated 148 referrals from GMPs and 9.5% positive malignancy pick-up, compared with 72 referrals with 1.4% pick up from GDPs.14 Roy et al. also showed that 55% of their referrals were from GMPs.9 In contrast, Pindolia et al. showed the majority of referrals to their HNC centre to be from GDPs.8 There is lots of conflicting and somewhat convoluted research in this area; thus, it would be safe to say a head and neck detection toolkit would be most useful for both GDPs and GMPs.",

The department have been able to do this for the majority of patients, however it has proved increasingly difficult as the number of urgent referrals are very high. Units are now pooling services and joining forces with other hospitals to help share the workload and ensure patients receive timely interventions. For example, several hospital units have joined forces in the north west and review all HNCs together. This shared workload, increased availability of resources and greater secondary care expertise is ensuring that patients are receiving the correct intervention within the right time frame, this is now known as the 'pan hospital MDT scheme'. Another recommendation is for the oncology leads in similar units to put together a focus group, ensuring that, nationwide, all departments will have the know-how and ability to be compliant with the NHS Long Term Plan.",

The limitation of this is that is does not account for non visible signs of HNC such as dysphonia, dysphagia or otalgia. However, our experience to date has showed us that this reduces hospital foot flow and highlights the patients who definitively require investigation. Once this subgroup arrive, we have created a one step clinic where a consultation, exam and possibly biopsy will be performed in the same visit. The aim of this is to again reduce hospital visits for patients, moreover it ensures that the next visit will entail diagnosis and initial treatment planning.

This could be done by adding to the undergraduate medical curriculumAn online toolkit should be developed to help ensure that the correct lesions are being sent in on the 2ww system. The available systems by Cancer Research UK and the BDA should be expanded on and publicised moreUltimately, this audit has shown that the 2ww urgent referral system is being overused. One would hope that the readers of this audit realise the importance of updating their knowledge in oral cancer detection and diagnosis. This will have a positive impact on a multidimensional basis; patients have the best chance of early detection and definitive cure, the referral system can be used to triage suspicious lesions only, and non-suspicious lesions can be managed locally, thus removing strain from the already convoluted hospital systemThis audit will be repeated in the coming years after the NHS Long Term Plan has been fully implemented; it would be useful to see if the aforementioned analysis and suggestions will have a positive impact on first treatment dates.",
