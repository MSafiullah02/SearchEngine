Technologies using arrays have proven to be reliable and affordable for most of the scientific community worldwide. By typing microarrays or proteomics into a search engine such as PubMed, thousands of references can be viewed. Nevertheless, almost everyone in life science research has a story to tell about array experiments that were expensive, did not generate reproducible data, or generated meaningless data. Because considerable resources are required for any experiment using arrays, it is desirable to evaluate the best method and the best design to ask a certain question. Multiple levels of technical problems, such as sample preparation, array spotting, signal acquisition, dye intensity bias, normalization, or sample-contamination, can generate inconsistent results or misleading conclusions. Technical recommendations that offer alternatives and solutions for the most common problems have been discussed extensively in previous work. Less often discussed is the experimental design. A poor design can make array data analysis difficult, even if there are no technical problems. This chapter focuses on experimental design choices in terms of controls such as replicates and comparisons for microarray and proteomics. It also covers data validation and provides examples of studies using diverse experimental designs. The overall emphasis is on design efficiency. Though perhaps obvious, we also emphasize that design choices should be made so that biological questions are answered by clear data analysis.",

Although the full potential of arrays is yet to be realized, these tools have shown great promise in deciphering complex diseases such as cancer (10-13).

In addition, the experimental design should incorporate controls to minimize sources of bias in an experiment. In statistical terms, bias is defined as the difference in value between a sample and a population measurement. More generally, bias is any partiality that prevents the objective consideration of an issue or situation. Experimental controls provide a means to measure and normalize biases associated with sample conditions and technical aberrations. To eliminate unwanted bias, it is necessary to include controls for experimental conditions in the analysis (17) . Microarray experiments typically involve small numbers of replicates where the assumptions of classical statistics (normally distributed values) do not apply. Typically, researchers calculate p values without testing the normality of the data. A more important concern is to control for technical biases and erroneous data through the implementation of experimental controls.",

The process of normalization seeks to eliminate such variation and thus enhance the reliability of results obtained from subsequent higher-order statistical analysis of the data (18,19) . Important low-level sources of technical variation are fluorescent intensities between two channels and the physical locations of spots on a microarray slide. Technical bias is introduced during array printing, extraction, labeling, and hybridization. Sophisticated normalization methods adjust such spatial and intensity bias. The diagnosis of bias and the assessment of normalization methods are currently accomplished using various plots (20). Using plots to assess normalization, however, does not specifically address how to order methods to best remove inconsistent bias patterns, how to compare methods statistically, or how to verify the quality of single arrays. In addition, postdata collection error may occur when bias is introduced by erroneous data normalization (21). Therefore, it is desirable to avoid nonbiological bias by implementing a rigorous quality control during all steps of the experiments, including sample preparation, probe amplification, array spotting, hybridization, and signal detection. Thus, if using custom-or home-made arrays, it is important to perform a range of optimization experiments to ensure quality control before performing actual experiments. Ensuring quality control will allow the use of simple normalization methods such as normalization of log values to the median of each array.",

Thus, measurements taken from a particular cell culture are biased by that culture and may not represent a broader gene expression. Pooling samples will conceal biological variation in that expression levels for a gene may vary in each sample. But, once pooled, all the replicates should indicate the same level. In this case, you can assume that any remaining variation is nonbiological. Data from pooled RNA replicates (technical replicates) would be useful for assessing the quality of the original arrays and the hybridization conditions. From a biological perspective, pooling RNA eliminates an important experimental control as well as potentially useful gene expression information. For considering sample controls, it is better to use several pools and fewer replications than one pool of all the available samples and multiple replications (22) .",

Details on how individual animals, cultures, or samples were handled through the course of an experiment can be important for identifying which biological samples and technical replicates are independent. Although it is tempting to avoid biological replicates in an experiment because the results seem to be more reproducible (23), it is useful to use them because they ensure that the results are biologically significant. In contrast, by eliminating biological replicates (e.g., pooling RNA), you can be somewhat certain that the remaining variation is technical (nonbiological). Replicate spots on the same slide provide an effective means to measure technical variation, which could represent array printing quality, hybridization conditions, or spotreading software. When initially calibrating laboratory conditions, you may focus on reducing technical error by using pooled RNA. After the conditions are optimized, the focus of measure may turn to controlling the biological variance.",

Measuring the signal at each spot as the ratio of experimental RNA to reference RNA targets, rather than relying on absolute signal intensity, decreases the variability by normalizing the signal output in any two-color hybridization experiment (26).

The main consideration for two-color arrays is which samples should be cohybridized. Two possible designs that compare gene expression can be applied using two-color arrays. (B) Direct comparison measures differential gene expression directly in the same slide. (C) In an indirect comparison, differential gene expression is measured in relation to a reference.",

In two-color microarrays, all treated samples should be hybridized with the untreated control. There are two fundamentally distinct designs in human studies to assess treatment effects (32). In one design, the investigator assigns the exposure and then measures the outcome (experimental). In the other design, the exposure is measured (observational). Most retrospective studies fall under the latter category. Casecontrol design is a good option in studies of gene expression patterns where the treatment and collection of tissue samples are not designed in the laboratory. Cases are patients who died or had recurrence (high aggressive), and controls are those who lived beyond a time line after diagnosis and treatment (low aggressive). For example, in a recent study, 60 patients were selected from a total of 103 ER-positive, early stage cases presented to Massachusetts General Hospital between 1987 and 1997, from whom tumor specimens were snap-frozen and for whom minimal 5-yr follow-up was available. In this study, breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen were compared for differential gene expression between tamoxifen responders and nonresponders (33) . Additional examples on using microarrays for the development and assessment of therapies are covered in previous reviews (4,34-37).",

Direct designs can generate results where a lower variance of estimated effects is obtained compared with indirect designs (22) . A balance between direct and indirect designs can be used as well.

Verification also can be extended to an independent data set to validate the ability of selected sets of genes to make a certain distinction, such as a treatment response or a clinical outcome. This strategy has been used to unveil gene expression profiles that predict clinical outcomes of breast cancer (43).

The use of immobilized pH gradients for the first dimension (59), as an alternative to carrier ampholytes, has made 2DE reproducible enough for proteome analysis. Although it is common to separate proteins through the linear pI range of 3.5-10 (isoeletric focusing), there are commercially available immobilized pH gradients with many different ranges so that the separation of proteins can be optimized to a desired range.

The critical issues are eliminating bias, providing a careful analysis of the data without overfitting, and recognizing its limitations. Proteomic experiments deal with many experimental design challenges, such as limited and variable sample amounts, sample degradation, posttranslational modifications, and disease or drug alterations. When performing differential spectra analysis or protein identification, a few key points should be considered for experimental design: 1 . It has been shown that both sensitivity and specificity decline significantly when samples are processed in the same laboratory after a delay of several months. Always keep samples at -80\u00b0C. 2. When using liquid chromatography coupled with an electron spray, randomize the sample order between control subject and patients, and, if possible, use several sample pools. 3. Always calibrate the mass spectrometer before an experiment. In MALDI-TOF, the use of commercially available controls that contain known masses can be mixed with the analyte and used as internal controls, or they can be spotted next to the analyte for MS/MALDI calibration. 4. In differential spectra analysis, biomarkers are expressed in very low amounts, so whether or not to deplete high abundant proteins (i.e., Albumin) is a key issue in experimental design. If such proteins are depleted, detection sensitivity for other proteins could be improved. However, many other proteins that stick to albumin also are removed, resulting in the loss of information and possible biomarkers. 5. The removal of contaminant peaks is an important step in protein identification. Trypsin autolysis and human keratin are among the most common contaminants having wellknown and characterized peaks. In the majority of spot identification cases, the removal of contaminant peaks from the mass spectrum will result in better spot identification with higher scores (67). It is important to note that, although rare, the protein of interest may have masses identical to one or more of these peaks, and its removal may reduce the match score. 6. In differential spectra analysis, choose the best method of data normalization (e.g., total ion current, maximum peak, intensity, etc.). 7. Optimize the MALDI-TOF laser frequency and intensity for a given experiment. Lower frequencies allow the detector to better recover; high laser intensity can result in a \"noisy\" spectrum. 8. Validate the experiment by using antibodies. Keep in mind that differentially expressed protein peaks could be related to well-known acute phase proteins and thus might not represent putative biomarkers. 9. When performing protein identification by using Web programs, always consider possible posttranslational modifications and tryptic missed cleavages.",

This standardization is not currently possible, because spectra reproducibility, especially of complex mixtures among different mass spectrometers, is still a challenge.

            "text": "Microarray applications towards the diagnostics or the pathogen-derived DNA/ proteome chips will have tremendous clinical value and they are not far away from the clinic. As of today, the lab-made Oligo or cDNA arrays are currently useful in research labs either for the classification of cancers or for infectious disease diagnosis, but their real applications did not reach the clinic. We hope that it is not too far from reality since US Food and Administration has approved Cytochrome P450 Affymetrix gene chip for the xenobiotics (drug resistance in liver disease) studies, which are commercially available through Roche. On the other hand, protein chips are available from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) for the study of protein-protein interactions; however their clinical applications also have not reached the pathology laboratories yet. Several groups, including Michael Snyder's (Yale), Joshua LaBaer's (Harvard), DeResi's (UCSF), Liotta and Petricoin's (George Mason University,) and companies such as Affymetrix, Illumina, JPT Peptide Technologies, GE Healthcare, Pierce Biotechnology, CombiMatrix, Agilent and others, are developing both DNA, protein, and glycoarrays for the diagnosis of infectious diseases (like coronavirus, Francisella tularensis, Vibrio cholerae). In recent years, contributions from the laboratory of Patrick Brown's group at Stanford are well appreciated in the field of microarrays, since he has looked at the global analysis of gene expression patterns in normal human tissues/cell lines, including several human disease tissues such as various forms of cancers, fibroblasts, peripheral blood, placenta and various compartments of eye, and developed a comprehensive \"global atlas of gene expression patterns\" (68), which will definitely be useful in the clinic in the coming decade.",

Assessing the activity of indi-vidual genes as a function of time is an example of time-course experiments. The oncogenic potential of cyclin D1 overexpression in a time dependent manner has been dissected by using gene expression profiling as a global assay (2). Comparing temporal gene expression patterns, following the expression of wild-type and mutant cyclin D1 proteins, revealed an expression profile of cyclin D1 target genes. In this case, the gene expression was analyzed from time 0 to 24 h postinfection with adenovirus. The genes were selected by expression levels in comparison with time 0 and 4 h and showed",
