In 2013, researchers in Seattle videotaped over 100 encounters between physicians and parents, of which 50% were vaccine-hesitant, in order to determine what predicted vaccine uptake at the end of the visit.24 They found that how we begin the conversation matters. Some physicians began the conversation with what the authors called a participatory approach, offering parents latitude over vaccination decisions with opening lines such as: \u201cWhat do you think about doing some shots today?\u201d Others presumed that parents intended to vaccinate their children, using phrases such as \u201cJohnnie is due for his 2-month vaccines today.\u201d When physicians used a presumptive approach, 74% of parents accepted vaccines; conversely, when physicians used a participatory approach, 83% of parents resisted vaccines.24 By emphasizing vaccination as the social norm, a presumptive approach helps parents draw confidence from provider confidence as they face the decision of vaccination. Its benefits accrue with use. A longitudinal study of 73 parent-child dyads found child immunization status at 8 months was associated with the number of presumptive discussions parents had with providers at 2, 4, and 6 month well-child visits.25 A presumptive approach also may increase adolescent vaccination uptake. A multi-arm randomized trial in 30 pediatric and family medicine clinics across North Carolina found a 5.4% increase (95% CI; 1.1%-9.7%) in HPV vaccination coverage for patients in clinics whose providers received presumptive training, compared with conversation training or usual care.26 One can imagine similar successes in alternative contexts (e.g. hospital care units, emergency departments, or subspecialty clinics) and with different vaccines. For example, a Seattle hospital-based intervention demonstrated that a presumptive approach with parents increases child seasonal influenza vaccination.27 To help pediatricians adopt a presumptive approach, the AAP has communication tools that generalize to diverse settings and can be built into electronic medical record systems.28 To build confidence in clinical settings, we should begin vaccination discussions presumptively.",

            "text": "Second, if patients or parents resist a presumptive approach, we should engage them with motivational interviewing. Instead of a paternalistic approach which compels parents to vaccinate because \u201cthe doctor said so,\u201d motivational interviewing guides conversations in a non-condescending manner so that parents gradually develop their own commitment to follow vaccine recommendations. The spirit of motivational interviewing has four components, easily remembered with the acronym PACE: Partnership, Acceptance, Compassion, and Evocation.29 The Table provides conceptual understandings of each component, applied to vaccination, and gives examples of clinician questions or comments that illustrate each component. When clinicians find themselves in difficult conversations, they can partner with parents to understand their earnest questions about vaccines, affirm them as fellow humans worthy of dignity, and bolster their values that align with vaccination. Clinicians who use motivational interviewing may also increase vaccine uptake. A recent randomized trial in 16 practices with 125 providers demonstrated that a presumptive approach with motivational interviewing increased human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine initiation for adolescents 13-17 years old by 9%, compared with a 3% decrease in controls.30 Providers believed that motivational interviewing was useful; 86% of providers reported using the technique frequently, much more so than websites, decision-aids, or disease images.31 A multi-site clinical trial to train providers on how to Presumptively Initiate Vaccines and Optimize Talk with Motivational Interviewing (PIVOT with MI) is ongoing.32 Given its perceived utility and effectiveness, motivational interviewing may even counter clinician burnout. In a pilot study of the impact of motivational interviewing on obesity-related patient encounters, clinicians who received training had notable improvements in their burnout scores, compared with controls.33 In sum, both parental confidence and physician wellbeing may improve as we work with vaccine hesitant parents via motivational interviewing.",

Of the 18 encounters in which providers used persistence only, 17 adolescents received the HPV vaccine; conversely, no adolescent received the vaccine when providers simply acquiesced.34 Furthermore, whether discussing childhood vaccines or HPV, physicians can persist over the short-term horizon of a visit through motivational interviewing, as described above.",

In the longitudinal study cited above, persistent use of the presumptive approach at 2-, 4-, and 6- month well child visits was associated with a \u223c35% decrease in a child\u2019s percentage of days under-immunized at 8 months.25 In another longitudinal study of nearly 500 parents who had ever declined HPV vaccination for their 11-17 year old child, researchers found that secondary acceptance of the HPV vaccine \u2013 within 12 months of an initial refusal \u2013 was associated with receiving follow-up counseling (OR 2.16; 95% CI, 1.42-3.28).35 When asked why they ultimately accepted the HPV vaccine for their child, one-third of parents cited receiving a second recommendation.35 We believe persistence will pay off with other vaccines as clinicians form long-term relationships with parents and children, understand their concerns, and recommend vaccines anew. Providers could also ask parents to sign a vaccine declination form, such as the one created by the AAP.36 As of 2011, nearly half of pediatricians and one third of family medicine physicians used such forms when parents refused vaccines.12 Although the use of a declination form has not been tested in a randomized trial, the use of such a form offers the opportunity to clearly delineate the risks of vaccine-preventable diseases, the importance of vaccines, and the responsibility parents have for the consequences of vaccine delay. Of course, we must discern the best time and context in which to introduce a declination form, but doing so may motivate parents on the fence to accept recommendations from their persistent providers.",

Practice dismissal may be a tempting option for burnt-out physicians to avoid hesitant parents and the public health risks their children pose to other patients. Yet, as SARS-CoV-2 circles the globe and researchers race to develop a vaccine, we can develop, in parallel, our ability to talk about vaccines with concerned parents. Evidence-based alternatives to dismissal exist, increase parental acceptance of vaccines, will keep under-vaccinated and unvaccinated children with pediatricians, and improve population health. As policymakers and public health experts work at system levels, we should consider what we as pediatricians might do to increase vaccine confidence. Who else is better positioned to do so than the pediatricians who form long-term relationships with parents and their children? Contentious conversations require care, but we believe evidence-based tools that teach a Presumptive Approach, Motivational Interviewing, and Persistence can help. As we work as pediatricians to improve the state of vaccine confidence, let us consider caring for vaccine-hesitant families, one visit at a time.",
