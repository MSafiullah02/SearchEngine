The use of inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy is a major determinant of mortality in patients with ICUAP [5], emphasizing the importance of a timely and accurate therapy for this infection [6]. For this reason, it is often necessary to use a combination of broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics, particularly in patients who are at risk for difficult-to-treat bacteria [7, 8]. Recent investigations have shown that multi-drug-resistant (MDR) or high-risk pathogens have been isolated in around half of patients with an episode of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ICUAP confirmed microbiologically [9, 10].",

Multiple etiologic pathogens are potentially an additional challenge for achieving appropriate antimicrobial treatment in these patients. A previous study reported a 48 % rate of polymicrobial etiology in episodes of VAP with microbiologic confirmation [11]. These authors concluded that the epidemiology and outcomes of patients with monomicrobial and polymicrobial VAP did not differ significantly. However, in this study, a substantial proportion of episodes classified as polymicrobial VAP had positive isolation of bacteria usually considered as non-pathogenic microorganisms. Moreover, between 15 % and 73 % patients with an episode of ICUAP are not previously intubated [2, 12, 13], namely non-ventilator ICUAP (NV-ICUAP).",

Indeed, a substantial proportion of microbial isolates reported in polymicrobial VAP in that study (42 %) represented these types of microbes [11]. Similarly, previous observational studies reported rates of polymicrobial etiology of VAP that ranged between 28 % and 50 % when PPMs and non-pathogenic microbes were analyszed [34\u201337]. Having included non-pathogenic microbes would have increased the rate of polymicrobial pneumonia to 30 % in our population.

Indeed, in our study the numbers of patients with MDR or XDR pathogens in our study did not differ with pneumonia of polymicrobial etiology.

Both studies suggested that some of these cases might also represent, at least in part, fluid overload due to congestive heart failure added to the underlying inflammatory process potentially mimicking pneumonia. Similarly, underlying chronic heart disease might hypothetically have contributed to the development of pulmonary congestion in patients with presumably lower bacterial burden, such as those with pneumonia of monomicrobial etiology.",
