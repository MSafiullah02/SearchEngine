            "text": " Influenza is foremost among all infectious diseases in terms of risk for serious complications and death in older adults and has been a cost-saving intervention in this population. At least 36,000 deaths and more than 100,000 hospitalizations from respiratory and cardiovascular complications of influenza occur annually in the United States (Thompson et al. 2003, 2004). In spite of only 40\u201360% efficacy in older adults (Govaert et al. 1994), current influenza vaccination programs are cost-effective in older people and even cost saving in developed countries due to the 30\u201340% reduction in influenza-related hospitalizations (Nichol et al. 1994; Vu et al. 2002). Hospitalizations rates are dramatically increased in adults aged 65 years and older in years when influenza A/H3N2 is the predominant circulation strain, relative to the rates observed when H1N1pdm09 virus has been the predominant circulating strain. The fact that seasonal influenza vaccines also prevent complications of influenza (pneumonia, heart attacks, strokes, and exacerbations of congestive heart failure) provides an even greater incentive to increase the use of existing vaccines and develop new vaccines that are targeted to improve vaccine efficacy (DiazGranados et al. 2014). However, the immune mechanisms which underlie the increased risk for complicated illness, and the recent decline in seasonal vaccine effectiveness against A/H3N2 strains (Belongia et al. 2016), are poorly understood.

Thus, the response to this virus in the context of age-related changes in the adaptive immune system will be discussed in significant detail as an example of what we might anticipate in terms of other potentially vaccine-preventable diseases in older people.",

            "text": "Influenza virus stimulates an antiviral response in bone-marrow-derived lymphocytes (B cells), monocytes, and thymus-derived lymphocytes (T cells) resulting in humoral and cell-mediated immunity, respectively. However, the effectiveness of this stimulus depends on the presentation of viral peptides to the T lymphocytes. There are two main cell types within the T lymphocyte population, helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells. Helper T cells are classically within the CD4 T cell subset and are further subtyped (according to the cytokines they produce) as T helper type 1 (Th1), T helper type 2 (Th2), T follicular helper (Tfh), T regulatory (Treg), and T helper type 17 (Th17) cells. The response to influenza virus in adult populations is the result of restimulation of a previously primed response through exposure to natural infection or prior vaccination. Virus-activated T cells, through a variety of cytokine mediators, stimulate B cells to differentiate and produce antibodies that are specific for the strains of virus contained in the vaccine (Virelizier et al. 1974). These specific antibodies bind to the surface glycoproteins (hemagglutinin [HA] and neuraminidase [NA]), to neutralize the viral particle. The peptide sequences on the outer surfaces of HA and NA, which are the antibody-binding sites, change as a result of high mutation rates in the influenza virus and selective pressure by the immune system against the native virus, a phenomenon known as antigenic drift. These changes in the HA identify a new circulating strain of influenza virus requiring annual updates in the influenza vaccine strains to ensure that antibody-mediated immunity is stimulated to the relevant predicted strains of the H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes of influenza A and influenza B.",

            "text": "Hemagglutination inhibition assays are the current industry standard for measuring antibody responses to influenza vaccination as a proxy for vaccine efficacy. There is a significant literature reporting a decline in antibody responses to influenza vaccination with aging (Goodwin et al. 2005). However, recent studies suggest that this observed decline may not be related to aging but instead to the effect of prior exposure to influenza (Reber et al. 2015) and repeated annual vaccination (Mosterin Hopping et al. 2016), and the phenomenon of original antigenic sin, more recently identified as antigenic seniority (Kucharski et al. 2015). Even though the B cell response to influenza vaccination is maintained in older adults, the antibody response is not; this appears to be impaired differentiation of B cells to antibody-producing plasma cells due to a decline in the activity of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and the transcription factor E47. These results highlight the fact the changes in the immune response with aging cannot be attributed to immune senescence alone and are further complicated when one considers the health status of study participants, their vaccination status, or the setting in which they were living. Clearly, factors that contribute to increasing frailty are expected to cause a further decline in immune responsiveness. These results suggest that additional mechanisms beyond antibody responses are involved in the loss of protection particularly against A/H3N2 strains with aging. Furthermore, even though the antibody response to vaccination might be predicted to decrease with repeated vaccination in older adults, annual repeated vaccination, in fact, improves protection against influenza in this population (Keitel et al. 1988; Ahmed et al. 1995; Voordouw et al. 2004) while annual repeated vaccination in children and adults has been associated with a loss of protection (McLean et al. 2014). Even so, the ability to mount a fourfold increase in antibody titers in response to influenza vaccination has been associated with a twofold reduction in influenza disease (Benoit et al. 2015). However, large influenza vaccine trials have not been statistically powered to determine if this protection, consistent with sterilizing immunity (antibody neutralization of the virus to prevent infection), translates to a reduced risk of hospitalization; thus, correlates of clinical protection against A/H3N2 disease (cell-mediated process to clear virus from the lungs) may be required. Vaccine-mediated protection may also be related to the duration of the antibody response to influenza vaccination, but a previous review of the literature found no difference between young and older adults in the rate of decay of antibody titers during the influenza season (Skowronski et al. 2008).",

            "text": "There has been a paradigm shift in understanding the limitations of antibody titers as a sole measure of influenza efficacy (Effros 2007). As a correlate of protection against influenza, our studies have shown that serum antibody titers do not distinguish between older adults who will go on to develop A/H3N2 influenza illness from those who do not, and may fail to predict vaccine failure (McElhaney et al. 2006, 2009; Shahid et al. 2010). Although antibodies are an important defense mechanism, both humoral and cell-mediated immunities are important for clinical protection in older adults (Murasko et al. 2002). A greater understanding of how T cell-mediated immunity contributes to increased protection against influenza is needed in the development of new influenza vaccines (reviewed in McElhaney et al. (2016)). Thus, the evaluation of the antibody response in clinical trials of new vaccines as a means to progress through the clinical trial phases to approve a new vaccine may fail to predict enhanced vaccine efficacy, particularly when efficacy is measured as a single endpoint of protection against all three vaccine strains (McElhaney et al. 2013). In this case, vaccine trials are more likely to give a true picture of enhanced efficacy when A/H3N2 is the predominant circulating strain (DiazGranados et al. 2014). ",

Thus, T cell recognition and the response to influenza do not degrade with antigenic drift (Effros et al. 1977; Butchko et al. 1978; Russell and Liew 1979). Internal peptide sequences of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are similar within the subtypes of influenza A (e.g., A/H3N2 vs. A/H1N1). Internal viral proteins (matrix and nucleoproteins) are conserved within the types of influenza (e.g., influenza A vs. B) (Mitchell and Callard 1983). Thus, peptides derived from surface glycoproteins and internal viral proteins stimulate helper T cell and CTL responses that are cross-reactive within the strains of influenza A or influenza B. In other words, antibody responses are relatively strain-specific, while T cell responses are cross-reactive across strains within influenza A or B, and have been immunologic targets for the development of universal influenza vaccines.",

A direct comparison between different routes of infection showed that protection correlated with the size of the virus-specific CTL (CD8+) response in the lungs and associated lymphoid organs. Although self-renewing populations of virus-specific CD8 T cells are maintained in the lymphoid organs for many years after influenza and other respiratory virus infections, protective cellular immunity is short-lived and disappears within about 6 months (Nguyen et al. 1999). However, this T cell memory response to the internal proteins of the influenza virus, matrix (M1) and nucleoprotein (NP), can be recalled during infection and, in the absence of protective antibody titers, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively, correlate with protection against A/H3N2 (Wilkinson et al. 2012) and pdmH1N1 (Sridhar et al. 2013) in young adults. In older adults, the CTL response to split-virus influenza vaccines in older adults is enhanced when the vaccine has been exposed to influenza through natural infection in the previous influenza season (McElhaney et al. 2009).

Helper T cells (Th) recognize antigens presented by the major histocompatibility complex Class II (MHC II); MHC II is expressed almost exclusively on antigen-presenting cells, B cells and T cells (Hackett and Eisenlohr 1990). In contrast, CD8+ CTLs recognize viral peptides in combination with MHC I; MHC I is expressed on most cells in the body (Ennis et al. 1981). Structural viral proteins and both live and inactivated viruses are phagocytozed by macrophages and dendritic cells. The virus is processed within the antigen-presenting cell and presented in combination with MHC II to helper T cells (Demotz et al. 1990). In contrast, viral peptides presented in combination with MHC I are generally the products of viral replication within the antigen-presenting cell, although antigen cross-presentation in dendritic cells is recognized as an important contribution in response to influenza vaccination (discussed below). Thus, the form of the viral antigen and the interaction with a specific MHC and its cellular location independently determine Th and CTL responses to vaccination (Hackett et al. 1991; Lamb et al. 1991).",

            "text": "Antigen cross-presentation is the process by which antigens including killed virus or viral proteins are taken up by the dendritic cells, undergo proteasomal degradation, and are processed for presentation on MHC I. Because inactive virus (contained in current parenteral influenza vaccines) is effectively presented on MHC II and not MHC I, helper T cells and B cells are stimulated to produce good antibody responses, but only weak CTL responses are seen in adults. This CTL response is not observed in influenza-na\u00efve individuals, and results from restimulation of a previously primed response to influenza through natural infection (Hackett et al. 1991; Lamb et al. 1991; Hosaka et al. 1988). This is the presumed mechanism by which inactivated viruses including split-virus influenza vaccines can stimulate CTLs (Askonas et al. 1982). The relevance of antigen cross-presentation to new vaccine development is that toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands (Plowden et al. 2004; Behzad et al. 2012), virosomes (Huckriede et al. 2005), virus-like particles (Bright et al. 2007), and potentially adjuvants (McElhaney et al. 2013; Puig-Barbera et al. 2004) can be used to activate antigen-presenting cells and enhance expression of MHC I-viral peptide complexes and improve the poor CTL responses elicited by the current killed virus vaccines. Boosting T cell responses is an important priority for vaccine development, in general, due to broader protection against serologically distinct strains of virus (Ray et al. 2004). Because immunosenescence alters several aspects of cell-mediated immune function, vaccine design can include independent strategies for effectively stimulating helper T cell and CTL responses.",

These Th subsets are defined by their cytokine products and/or their location within lymphoid tissues. The Th1 cytokine, interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), provides help along with IL-2 in the development of both B cell and CD8 CTL responses to influenza, and is down-regulated by the production of IL-10 from Treg (Gardner and Murasko 2002). Th2 also provide help to B cells but not CD8 CTL. The IFN-\u03b3:IL-10 ratio declines with age (Skowronski et al. 2011) and is inversely correlated with risk for influenza illness in older adults (McElhaney et al. 2006), suggesting that a shift toward a Th1 response to influenza vaccination is important for protection in older adults.",

This is in contrast to the known inflammatory responses to viral infections that trigger a variety of pathways involved in host defense. It has been shown in aged mice and humans that the addition of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1) or the combination of IL-2 and IL-6 can reverse age-related defects in Th1 cytokine production, proliferation, and function (Haynes et al. 2004). Our recent study has shown that these combined effects of IL-2 and IL-6 can restore influenza-specific CD8 CTL function in older adults to that observed in young adults in both mice and humans (Zhou et al. 2016), and suggests a mechanism that can be targeted for developing more protective vaccines.

Even though current inactivated influenza vaccines stimulate a CTL response in older and even chronically ill older adults (Gorse and Belshe 1990), this response and degree of cross-reactivity is diminished compared to young adults (Powers 1993; Mbawuike et al. 1993; McElhaney 2005) and is not as robust as the response to vaccination following natural infection (McElhaney et al. 2009; Shahid et al. 2010).",

Granzyme B (GrB) is a key element of the T cell response to influenza in the lung (Johnson et al. 2003; Lawrence et al. 2005; Jenkins et al. 2007). An assay of GrB activity in lysates of influenza virus-stimulated PBMC correlates with cytolytic activity(Ewen et al. 2003), and low ex vivo levels of GrB predict increased risk for influenza illness in older adults (McElhaney et al. 2006, 2009; Shahid et al. 2010). Other ex vivo studies have shown no difference in influenza-specific CTL frequencies in older compared to young adults (Boon et al. 2002) and susceptibility in older adults may be due to decreased cytolytic activity (and the amount of GrB produced) on a per cell basis (Ouyang et al. 2003).

A weakened CTL response to influenza that is poorly stimulated by inactivated vaccines contributes to the observed increased risk of serious complications. Recent developments including a high-dose influenza vaccine containing four times the amount of antigen in the standard dose vaccine has demonstrated a 24% improvement in efficacy against influenza illness and enhanced protection against hospitalizations for pneumonia during the influenza season. Live-attenuated intranasal vaccines were developed to provide more effective stimulation of CTL. However, these vaccines have shown minimal additional benefit in older adults probably due to neutralization of the vaccine virus by antibodies in the nasal mucosa (Gorse et al. 2003). Current efforts are focused on the use of adjuvants to improve vaccine-mediated protection. ",

            "text": " With aging and the multiple immune responses that have been stimulated throughout one\u2019s lifetime, there is a gradual shift from predominantly na\u00efve T cells to increasing proportions of memory T cells. Thymic involution and the loss of na\u00efve T cells with aging may thus exhaust the capacity to respond to new antigens. An age-related decline in IL-7 levels that support thymic rejuvenation corresponds to failure to maintain or expand the effector memory helper T cell response to influenza (Kang et al. 2004). More recently, this age-related change in the response to influenza has been associated with persistent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and the accumulation of late-differentiated T cells with a reversal in the normal CD4:CD8 T cell ratio, which declines to less than one. In CMV seropositive compared to seronegative older adults, there is a decline in the CD4 T cell response to influenza peptides derived from the influenza internal proteins, matrix (M), and nucleoprotein (NP), which is not seen in young adults (Derhovanessian et al. 2013). Further, this effect of CMV appears to be a major driver of the shift of the na\u00efve T cell pool to the central and effector memory subsets (reviewed in Pawelec et al. (2005)). This effect is more pronounced in CD8 T cells and yet there is no difference in their response to M- and NP-derived peptides in seropositive versus seronegative older adults (Derhovanessian et al. 2014). These results suggest that additional mechanisms underlie age-related changes in CD8 T cells.",

The phenomenon of replicative senescence has been associated with these changes and relates to the finite number of doublings (25\u201330 cycles) after which cell cycle arrest occurs (Effros 1997). In CTLs, growth arrest associated with replicative senescence also shows increased production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, resistance to apoptosis (Effros et al. 2003), and loss of the costimulatory molecule, CD28, required for optimal stimulation of CTLs (Effros et al. 1994; Engwerda et al. 1994). CTL that do not express CD28 (CD28-CTL) have little or no cytolytic activity (Effros 2003) and an increased proportion of CD28-CTLs is associated with a decline in antibody responses to influenza vaccination (Goronzy et al. 2001; Saurwein-Teissl et al. 2002) and a reduction in influenza-specific memory CTL (Xie and McElhaney 2007). These changes have been associated with chronic CMV infection driving the T cell response to terminal differentiation and expressing this senescent phenotype (Vasto et al. 2007; Vescovini et al. 2007). However, it remains uncertain the extent to which this change may affect the Th and CTL responses to influenza and influenza vaccination. ",

While current vaccines are cost-saving and new more efficacious vaccines have recently been approved, a margin for further improvement still remains. Recent studies suggest that there is a significant opportunity to exploit the reserve capacity of T cells to respond to influenza antigens through enhanced antigen presentation, regulation of cytokine responses, and the addition of adjuvants. Targeting identified immunologic mediators that modulate influenza risk in older people, and screening candidate vaccines for clinical trials using appropriate correlates of protection in this population, is critical to development of more effective influenza vaccines for an aging population. Since the early phases of vaccine development often rely on antibody titers as a surrogate of protection, this measure may fail to detect a more robust T cell response and thus, a more effective vaccine for the 65 and older population.",

The increased risk of shingles with age has been well documented with an annual incidence of 14/1000 in those aged 75 years and older and an astonishing prevalence of up to 50% of those over age 85 years (Hope-Simpson 1965; Schmader 2001; Brisson et al. 2001). Reactivation causes a painful dermatomal rash called shingles that is often followed by PHN, a chronic pain syndrome defined as pain lasting for >90 days following zoster and associated with significant disability in older people. The incidence of PHN is almost negligible before age 50, but at least 50% of patients older than 60 years and almost 75% beyond age 70 become affected following an attack of shingles. Health-related quality of life is significantly impacted by zoster with >90% of over 65 year olds reporting pain with a median duration of 1 month (Drolet et al. 2010). The functional consequences of pain are significantly diminished with the resolution of zoster, but in the context of PHN, the pain and impact on daily function often continues for more than 6 months (Drolet et al. 2010). This contrasts with shingles in children where the rash generally follows a mild case of chicken pox and is of little clinical significance (Feder and Hoss 2004). Antiviral therapy is available but older people often do not present within the 48\u201372 h window of onset of the rash necessary for initiation of effective treatment. In addition, 20% of older people who receive therapy within the therapeutic window still experience pain 6 months after the onset of the rash (Cunningham and Dworkin 2000). Particularly given the number of people who do not seek or receive timely and effective treatment of shingles, the prevalence of disability and poor quality of life related to PHN is a major public health concern.",

            "text": " Because VZV is exclusively a human herpes virus (Cohrs et al. 2004), there are limited animal models that study the immunological mechanisms of VZV infection and reactivation (Baiker et al. 2004). However, much is known about the virology of VZV infection from studies of the live-attenuated Oka vaccine strain of VZV showing rapid evolution of the virus within the first 13 days of infection with no further replication of the virus once latency is established (Weinert et al. 2015). From the limited studies to date, it appears that with the resolution of chickenpox, VZV-specific CTL access the dorsal root ganglion where VZV lives, to keep viral replication in check (Baiker et al. 2004; Arvin et al. 1996). At some point, reactivation of latent VZV is associated with marked inflammation of the dorsal root ganglion leading to nerve cell damage and the pain associated with PHN often precedes the onset of the dermatomal rash. The latent virus escapes to replicate in nerves and skin to cause a very painful condition that continues even after the rash resolves and appears to be related to both central and peripheral nerve damage. Although there is a general decline in circulating VZV-specific CD4+ T cells with aging, these IFN-\u03b3-secreting T cells demonstrate a robust response at the site of the shingles rash, with similar numbers and function to that seen in young adults. However, regulatory T cells (Foxp3+CD4+T cells) also accumulate at the site of infection in older adults and may inhibit the activity of otherwise functionally competent VZV-specific T cells (Vukmanovic-Stejic et al. 2013; Vukmanovic-Stejic et al. 2015). Although there are no identified immunologic correlates of protection against zoster reactivation, VZV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are believed to play a central role in latency and reactivation of the virus within the dorsal root ganglion (Arvin 2008; Steain et al. 2014; Gowrishankar et al. 2010). These results highlight the importance of designing vaccines to stimulate cell-mediated immunity to prevent reactivation of VZV and protect against zoster and PHN, rather than the usual focus on antibody responses to prevent infection.

Furthermore, there was a reduction in the overall burden of illness in vaccinated subjects showing statistical significance for the primary end-point in the trial. The vaccine strain of VZV is a previously attenuated live virus (Oka strain) that is predicted to stimulate humoral, Th, and CTL responses. Importantly for this disease, antibody titers do not predict protection from reactivating the virus to cause shingles. The postulated mechanism of protection is stimulation of the VZV-specific T cell response to vaccination and measured by the IFN-\u03b3 enzyme-linked spot (ELISpot assay) (Levin et al. 2003; Smith et al. 2003). More recent studies have confirmed that the live attenuated zoster vaccine boosts both VZV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Sei et al. 2015), which appear to be important in preventing zoster reactivation and peripheral control of the infection in the nerves and skin. It is also important to highlight that this live attenuated vaccine Oka zoster strain was not identified in any of the VZV isolates from the skin of shingles cases in the vaccine trial, and thus can be safely and effectively used to stimulate the senescent immune response.",

However, the development of a vaccine against herpes zoster depended on a very large clinical trial to determine vaccine efficacy based on clinical outcomes. In the absence of reliable immunologic markers of vaccine efficacy, there was significant risk that the vaccine would fail to show an improvement. If the vaccine had failed in this trial, there may have been limited interest from industry in moving forward with alternate plans to develop an improved vaccine.

The importance of this respiratory illness, particularly in older adults, is increasingly recognized; it was recently reported that RSV causes 10,000 excess deaths and is second only to the A/H3N2 strains of influenza as a cause of death due to viral respiratory illness in the age 65 and older population (Thompson et al. 2003; Mullooly et al. 2007). Although the virus is genetically stable over time (in contrast to influenza), repeat infections throughout adult life are common suggesting the immunity to this virus wanes over time. Those older adults with increased risk for severe disease are those with congestive heart failure and chronic lung disease, the severely immunocompromised, and those living in long-term care facilities (Falsey et al. 1992). Estimates of RSV disease in this setting range from 5 to 10% of residents per year with pneumonia and death in 10\u201320% and 2\u20135% of cases, respectively. As with influenza illness in older adults, RSV results in prolonged lengths of hospital stay, significant disability and loss of independence in basic activities of daily living, and the need for a higher level of care at hospital discharge (Falsey et al. 2005). A recent analysis of RSV illness in the context of a large influenza vaccine trial showed that RSV causes a significant proportion of the moderate to severe influenza-like illness during the winter months (Falsey et al. 2014).",

Similarly, low serum and nasal antibody levels are risk factors for infection and disease severity in older adults but this is not an age-specific change (Walsh et al. 2004; Walsh and Falsey 2004). More importantly, older adults have a greater rise in antibody titers post infection than do their younger counterparts (Walsh and Falsey 2004). Since the RSV virus does not undergo antigenic drift over time, one would predict from this result, better protection against recurrent RSV illness would be predicted in older adults and is inconsistent with the relative increased risk of RSV infection with aging. A shift from Th1 to a Th2 response to RSV causes significant pathology in humans and in the aged mouse model, diminished CD8+ CTL responses associated with decreased IFN-\u03b3 (Th1) and increased IL-4 (Th2), and higher RSV titers in lungs (Zhang et al. 2002). However, recent studies in human PBMC show no age-related changes in cytokine levels produced in response to RSV although the regulatory balance between inflammatory (IFN-\u03b3 and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokine levels may be altered (Looney et al. 2002).",

This presents a diagnostic challenge to clinicians as the symptoms of RSV illness completely overlap with those related to influenza illness (Wald et al. 1995). Thus, treatment approaches would be particularly problematic as a strategy for limiting the complications of RSV and none are currently available for use in adults. The development of a vaccine against RSV has proven to be a significant challenge, perhaps due to the reliability of antibody titers as a correlate protection in these trials. Recent efforts to develop an RSV vaccine for older adults have focused on combining RSV subunit proteins with adjuvants but these are in the early stages of development. The ongoing challenges to developing an RSV vaccine for older adults is that the correlates of protection are poorly understood, and the overlapping symptomatology and cocirculation with influenza over the winter months.",

In the case of H5N1, vaccines will not only have to stimulate an antibody response to the new vaccine strain but will also have to prime the T cell response to influenza peptides derived from H5; age-related changes in na\u00efve T cells would result in decreased production of IL-2 and hence the proliferative response to the vaccine in both B and T cells. This has implications for both pre-pandemic and pandemic vaccines. Pre-pandemic vaccines if formulated to more potently stimulate T cells could offer cross-protective immunity that would be enhanced with strain-specific antibodies against the pandemic strain. Although this strategy may offer enhanced protection in older adults, pre-pandemic and pandemic vaccines need to be tested for their ability to stimulate adequate antibody responses but also cross-protective cell-mediated immunity.

This is especially evident when older adults contract newly emerging diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which killed 50% of infected individuals over the age of 50 (Chen et al. 2005). The rapid human-to-human transmission of SARS exposed the entire age spectrum to a novel virus and highlighted the changes in the immune system that lead to increased morbidity and mortality rates with aging. Fortunately, the outbreak was controlled without a vaccine and before it could reach epidemic proportions. Older adults may also be na\u00efve to viruses such as West Nile Virus (WNV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and appear to be at increased risk of serious complications. When these viruses are contracted by an aged host, the senescent immune system may produce a less effective response compared to young adults. Evidence for this decline is from epidemiologic studies showing much higher mortality rates in older compared to young adults with WNV (Nash et al. 2001). However, a recent study has shown that there is no loss with aging in the polyfunctionality of CD8+ T cells responding to WNV infection (Lelic et al. 2012). It remains to be determined whether changes in Foxp3+ CD4+ T cells may have a role in suppressing the CD8+ T cell response.",

Further, there is a significant decline in antibody titers to PPS at 6 years following pneumococcal vaccination (Musher et al. 1993).

This trial utilized a novel antigen detection assay of pneumococcal serotypes in the urine, in the diagnosis of both pneumococcal bacteremia and pneumonia. Prior to the development of this assay, vaccine efficacy and effectiveness studies have been limited the diagnosis of pneumococcal disease to the detection of pneumococcus in the sputum, blood, or cerebrospinal fluid, posing a significant challenge to studies in older adults. Studies have shown that the introduction of PCV7 into the childhood vaccination schedule has led to herd immunity in older adults whereby the circulation of these serotypes contained in the vaccine begin to decline and thus are not transmitted to older adults. Previous studies were based on the detection of invasive pneumococcal disease. More recent studies utilizing urinary antigen detection have shown that this protection applies to both invasive and noninvasive pneumococcal disease in older adults (van Werkhoven et al. 2016). These observations support the emerging policies for pneumococcal vaccination in older adults to include both PCV13 and PPV23 in the vaccination schedule.",

Protein-conjugated pneumococcal vaccines (PCV) were developed to facilitate T cell cooperation (Perry and Catterall 1994) and thus may be more effective in targeting T cell responses that are known to decline with aging. Although fewer serotypes are represented in the current PCV13 vaccine, it appears to be more effective than PPV23, albeit for the serotypes contained in the vaccine as there is no known cross-reactivity in the antibody responses between the different serotype polysaccharides. In light of the enhanced efficacy of PCV13 and the anticipated increase in the circulation of non-PCV13 serotypes due to the PCV13 effects on herd immunity, pneumococcal vaccine schedules for older adults are being modified to include PCV13 followed by PPV23 to provide protection against the serotypes not contained in PCV13.",

            "text": "Cytokine responses to pneumococcal antigens have been shown to regulate responses to protein- and polysaccharide-specific antibody responses (Khan et al. 2004) and may be important in the pathogenesis of pneumococcal diseases (Kemp et al. 2002). Cytokine responses to the whole pneumococcus could explain changes in the virulence of different serotypes in older adults (Robinson et al. 2001) and in comparison to cytokine responses in younger adults (Arva and Andersson 1999). TNF-\u03b1 produced by macrophages is associated with an initial inflammatory response to pneumococcal invasion (Perry and Catterall 1994; van der Poll et al. 1996) and has been found to be important in the development of antibodies to pneumococcal surface proteins (Khan et al. 2004; Khan et al. 2002). Increased levels of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine product of both macrophages and regulatory T cells, have been associated with increased risk for pneumococcal infection (van der Poll et al. 1996), but this cytokine becomes important for immunomodulation of the inflammatory response in the recovery from pneumococcal infection (Williams et al. 2015). Moreover, the gut microbiota has been shown in the mouse model to have role in the regulation of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 in defense mechanisms against pneumococcal pneumonia (Schuijt et al. 2016) suggesting that the dysregulation of cytokine responses with aging may be more complicated than what can be ascribed to immune senescence alone.

Based upon studies in mice, a vaccine containing the A\u03b21\u201342 peptide was shown to stimulate antibody production and improved cognitive function in mouse models of AD. This vaccine was advanced to a Phase II clinical trial based on the demonstration of no significant adverse effects of vaccination in a Phase I trial that included 200 subjects. The Phase II trial was halted due to the development of aseptic meningoencephilitis in 6% of the 300 vaccinated subjects. Analysis of the antibody response to A\u03b2 showed a trend toward cognitive enhancement in the \u201cresponders\u201d to vaccination (antibody titer to A\u03b21\u201342 \u2265 1:2200) but 22% of \u201cresponder\u201d compared to 2% of \u201cnonresponders\u201d developed aseptic meningoencephilitis (Patton et al. 2006). These results suggested that adverse effects of the vaccine were related to the immune response to the vaccine rather than toxicity of the A\u03b21\u201342. Post-mortem studies of the meningoencephilitis cases showed substantial clearing of A\u03b2 from the brain but with marked T cell infiltration in brain tissue.",

            "text": "The postulated age-related defect that leads to the pathology of AD related to APC uptake of A\u03b2 and stimulation of Th1 cytokines, an inflammatory response to A\u03b2. This defect is associated with inefficient phagocytosis of A\u03b2 and the production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) and chemokines, and nitric oxide leading to complement activation and T cell apoptosis (Monsonego et al. 2003). The immune mechanism being targeted by the vaccine was T cell-dependent antibody production against A\u03b2 to form A\u03b2-antibody complexes for more efficient clearing of the A\u03b2. Earlier studies had shown that A\u03b21\u201342 effectively stimulated a proliferative response in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). This response was increased in older compared to young adult subjects and a further significant increase was observed in older adult subjects with AD (Monsonego et al. 2003). It had been shown that A\u03b21\u201315 was responsible for B cell stimulation and the production of antibodies to A\u03b2, and A\u03b215\u201342 most effectively stimulated T cell proliferation and the production of both Th1 (IFN-\u03b3) and Th2 (IL-13) cytokines. Because a Th1 (vs. Th2) response in the AD mouse model was associated with more effective clearance of A\u03b2 in the mouse model, QS21 adjuvant was added to the A\u03b2 vaccine used in human trials to stimulate a Th1 response to the vaccine. It is postulated that the adjuvanted vaccine activated A\u03b2-specific memory T cells that migrated to the sites of A\u03b2 deposition in the brain producing Th1 cytokines. Although the antibody response appeared to effectively clear A\u03b2, the inflammatory cytokine response of the T cell infiltrate leads to meningoencephalitis. Since the A\u03b215\u201342 stimulated both Th1 and Th2 cytokines, it appears that the addition of the QS21 adjuvant may have been responsible for the serious adverse effects of the A\u03b2 vaccine (Monsonego and Weiner 2003). While efforts continue to develop immunologic-based therapies for AD, the results of this clinical trial continue to have significant consequences for future vaccine development and a recent review cites a critical need for new development strategies (Marciani 2016).

These are largely attributed age-related changes in T cell-mediated immunity and defects in defense mechanisms mediated by Th1 (IFN-\u03b3) and CTL. This would suggest that more potent vaccines for older adults should stimulate Th1 and CTL to a particular pathogen. However, the underlying mechanism for defective immune responses in older people remains poorly understood including the potential negative impact of elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines (including IFN-\u03b3) and the suppressive effects of regulatory T cells. This complex set of interactions in the activation of a protective immune response highlights the importance of developing correlates of protection and identifies novel targets for vaccine development to improve protection against a variety of infectious diseases in older adults. In spite of our limited understanding, a number of available vaccines have been shown to be cost-effective and even cost-saving in older adults. Future research to better understand the immunologic targets for the prevention or treatment of a variety of acute and chronic diseases and prevent disability in older adults will make a significant contribution to \u201cadding life to years.\u201d",
