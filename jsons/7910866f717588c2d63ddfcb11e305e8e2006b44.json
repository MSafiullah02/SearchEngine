Evidence of hemorrhage was confirmed and categorized by a fellowship trained neuroradiologist.

Results: We identified 33 COVID-19 positive patients with ICH, mean age 61.6 years (range 37 to 83 years), 21.2% of whom were female. Parenchymal hemorrhages with mass effect and herniation occurred in 5 (15.2%) patients, with a 100% mortality rate. Of the remaining 28 patients with ICH, 7 (25%) had punctate hemorrhages, 17 (60.7%) had small-moderate size hemorrhages, and 4 (14.3%) had a large single site of hemorrhage without evidence of herniation. Almost all patients received either therapeutic dose anticoagulation (in 22 [66.7%] patients) or prophylactic dose (in 3 [9.1] patients) prior to ICH discovery.",

Moreover, COVID-19 patients have elevated coagulation markers such as D-dimer, which in turn is correlated with increased mortality (3) . Recent expert opinion recommends that all admitted patients receive VTE prophylaxis, but some centers have escalated their anticoagulation regimen for patients with certain risk factors (4) .

The majority of these patients received therapeutic anticoagulation, most commonly UFH. The most frequent indication for starting anticoagulation was elevated D-dimer levels, reflecting a trend among centers to intensify anticoagulation regimens in COVID-19 positive patients based on evidence of hypercoagulability including increased D-dimer.(4) Although the large hemorrhages causing herniation were thought to be the result of primary intracranial hemorrhage, the majority of the other hemorrhages were hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic stroke.",
