While evidence abounds in the animal literature for the ability of female gametes to attract their would be suitors via a variety of devices, ARTs as we practice today have all but given up letting Mother Nature take her course. In the surge for selection dictated by the expanded usage of ICSI, the embarrassment of riches presented by the normospermic patient in reality becomes a wishful expectation for homogeneity.",

Synchronizing genomes from mom and dad with respect to acquiring chromatin maturity states capable of working the magic of syngamy is one of the most significant processes initializing the very beginnings of human development. And the road taken by the sperm head on its way to becoming the male pronucleus is as elegant example of nuclear remodeling as can be imagined. From unraveling compacted chromatin, to protamine displacement and nucleosome assembly, to constructing a card-carrying nucleus, this remarkable process in a matter of hours yields the paternal complement to the female pronucleus that will forever-maybe-be united in the ultimate spirit of zygosity. And while the male genome demands and consumes resources stored in the oocyte cytoplasm, achieving perfect registration of chromatin states is no simple matter and failings of the slightest varieties can have both short and long term impacts on future development (1) .",

Even though we rest comfortably in attributing maturity to the status of oocytes bearing signs of having arrested at metaphase of meiosis 2 (M2s), reality is far different given when maturation is measured in its full form. Routine practices of controlled ovarian stimulation do not always yield a basket full of M2s and even if they look mature, timing is essential without an accurate estimate of just when an hCG trigger did its thing to the oocyte (2) . Exactly what is regulating the differential processing of chromatin from maternal and paternal chromatin has been a mystery until recently where protamine specific patterns of phosphorylation have now been reported to make a difference in assuring the correct timing for matching chromatin states (3) . Room for problems leading to asynchrony between genomes still exist. Disparities inherent in the maturation window for oocyte or sperm are likely given our inability to ascertain discriminating properties of gametes as we select them in the embryology laboratory. Besides maturation disparities, we are gradually coming to appreciate that even in the case of the normospermic individual, looks can be deceiving even in the face of our most trident measures of performance.",

Abstracts from the meeting are also included in this issue. Of the breakthrough research presented at this meeting, exemplifying again how this field has created multiple avenues for basic and applied research in reproductive medicine, are advances in the topic of oocyte in vitro maturation. With more younger patients seeking fertility preserving treatments, the particular case of how ovarian materials might be deployed beyond autologous tissue transplantation has remained of great interest (5) . Now the group from Copenhagen has discovered that residual medullary tissues left over following preparation of cortical strips (for cryopreservation) are a rich source of human oocytes many of which are capable of initiating and completing maturation in vitro (Improving the maturation rate of human oocytes collected ex vivo during the cryopreservation of ovarian tissue; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10815-020-01724). Taking such a strategy into the clinic is evidenced by the case report of Kirillova and her colleagues who not only used this material to obtain mature oocytes but generated euploid blastocysts for future use (Cryopreservation of euploid blastocysts obtained after fertilization of in vitro matured ovarian tissue oocytes: a case report https://doi.org/10. 1007/s10815-020-01729).",
