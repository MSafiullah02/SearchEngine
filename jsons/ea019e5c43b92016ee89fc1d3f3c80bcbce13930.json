Numeracy encompasses the ways in which people cope with the mathematical, quantitative, and statistical demands of adult life, and is viewed as an important outcome of schooling and as a foundational skill for all adults. The focus on vulnerability stems from the realization that concerns of policy makers and educators alike often center on populations seen as vulnerable. The paper is organized in five sections. After a brief introduction, Section 2 examines adult numeracy, focusing on five numeracy domains (health, financial, digital, civic, and workplace numeracy), literacynumeracy linkages, functional and critical aspects of numeracy, and the centrality of numeracy practices, and notes sources of vulnerability for each of these. Section 3 sketches formal, non-formal and informal contexts in which adults learn or develop their numeracy, and examines factors that may be potential sources of vulnerability, including systemic factors and dispositional and affect factors. Section 4 reflects more broadly on the concept of vulnerability, introduces selected aspects of the papers published in this issue of ZDM Mathematics Education, and points to findings regarding adult learners who may be deemed vulnerable. The closing section summarizes conclusions and research directions regarding the intersection of the three core domains. Overall, the paper points to emerging research needs and educational challenges that are relevant to scholars, practitioners, and policy makers interested in developing the numeracy of adults as well as in the mathematics education of younger learners.",

Indeed, as reviewed later, large-scale studies show that sizeable proportions of adults and young adults in many countries (including many high-income or developed ones) demonstrate low numeracy (or mathematical literacy).",

After all, in many countries, young people leave schools early on, and enter the adult world or the labor market well before age 18. Many countries are expressing interest in mathematical literacy, which is closely linked with adult numeracy. Hence, some of the insights developed in this paper, and the findings and ideas presented in the other papers in this issue of ZDM Mathematics Education, will also be of value to educators and researchers interested in mathematics education at the school level, in both STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) and vocational education, and in working with young people and adults deemed vulnerable in such contexts.",

Hence, we focus here on selected sources from multiple disciplines that enable us to sketch each of the three areas in broad strokes, but mainly help to examine their intersection and explore sources of potential vulnerability. Furthermore, since issues pertaining to the skills, dispositions, and practices of teachers, programs, and learners are influenced by many factors, the paper combines an educationalist lens with a policy or systemic lens.

            "text": "Increased attention to adult numeracy is manifested in many ways around the globe. In particular, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Target 4.6 calls on all world countries to \"ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy\" by 2030 (see: https ://susta inabl edeve lopme nt.un.org/sdg4). The explicit inclusion of numeracy in this goal implies that there are serious gaps regarding numeracy (and literacy) levels across the globe. The growing acknowledgement and interest in adult numeracy is also evident in the coverage of numeracy and related constructs in large-scale assessment programs, at both the international and national levels. The Adult Literacy and Lifeskills (ALL) survey in the mid-2000s was the first study to explicitly address numeracy, which was later included as a major domain in OECD's Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), which was undertaken between 2008 and 2019 in 39 countries and regions, including seven non-OECD participants. These adult assessments surveyed people aged 16-64. The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), which focuses on school students aged 15 years old, which was implemented in its latest cycle in 2018 in 79 countries, focused on a similar construct, mathematical literacy (Tout and Gal 2015) . These surveys and the many policy-related studies that use their results, highlight the need to address both the numeracy and the literacy skills of a country's population.",

The concept of literacy has a long tradition of being understood in plural as literacies and the literature refers to literacies as being situated, purposeful, and occurring within specific literacy domains (Barton and Hamilton 2000) . Parallel developments have occurred in terms of attention to multiple numeracies. An early scheme developed by Steen (1990) outlined five purposes for numeracy: Practical, (focused on mathematical and statistical knowledge and skills that can help to cope with tasks in daily life); Professional (mathematical and statistical skills needed in specific jobs); Civic (data and uses that can benefit society); Recreational (related to the role of mathematical ideas and processes in games, sports, lotteries, and diverse leisure activities); and Cultural (appreciation of mathematical aspects of human culture, such as in artistic artifacts). Many other projects have looked at the roles and purposes of numeracy over the last few decades. Gal (1997) listed nine contexts that build and elaborate on Steen's scheme: home, recreation, active parenting, personal finance, informed citizenship, social action, workplace, passing tests, and further education. In Australia, the concept of different numeracies was developed from the notion of different literacies mentioned above, and was used in curriculum frameworks for both adults and young people. It centered around four domains (Kindler 1996) : Numeracy for practical purposes, Numeracy for interpreting society, Numeracy for personal organization (e.g., money, time, and travel/location), and Numeracy for knowledge, which addressed more formal mathematical skills needed for further study.",

Hence, this section discusses some of these links and connections. Solving a numeracy problem situated in the real world often involves a process of reading, interpreting, solving, and communicating in a mathematical manner. As part of such process, it is necessary to understand and use a range of both text-embedded informal and formal linguistic components (both oral and written), as well as mathematical terms, language, symbols, and representations. Literacy aspects are critical in reporting and communicating results. An added complexity, is that the language of mathematics itself is particularly critical as part of the problem-solving process.",

Work on numeracy practices evolved from Lave's early research on cognition in practice (Lave 1988) , and continued with discussions on (young) adults' numeracy and conceptualizations of mathematical knowledge and behavior as social practices (e.g., Evans et al. 2017) . Such work suggested that skills and how they are acted out in the world may be shaped by a community of practice and by one's levels and ways of engagement with diverse tasks, and as such, should be measured (Coben and Alkema 2017) . Yasukawa et al. (2018) recently summarized the theoretical development of the overarching concept of numeracy as social practice, arguing that numeracy is not free of value or context, but embedded in power relations. They base these ideas not only on Street's work, but also on three generations of the Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) developed by Vygotsky, Leontiev and Engestr\u00f6m, and on Lave's early work on situated learning.",

For numeracy, questions typically inquire, \"how often do you normally\u2026\" followed by a list of activities, such as read invoices, bank statements or similar; read plans, maps or graphs; calculate prices, costs or budgets; calculate using fractions, decimals or percentages; read diagrams, charts or tables; use simple formulas or similar; or use higher level mathematics or statistics.

Likewise, PIAAC data showed that employed people engage in mathematical activities less in their private settings if they do not engage in mathematical activities regularly at work.

Overall, studies regarding numeracy practices (both in the social context and in terms of skill use) provide new insights into multiple types of factors that may contribute to growth, retention, or decline of skills throughout the lifespan.

However, the literature reiterates that as with any competency, numeracy encompasses a set of diverse skills, knowledge-bases, and other building blocks that range from simple to very advanced. Numeracy should, therefore, not be seen as pertaining to simple or basic levels of mathematical knowledge, but as a complex competency.

For many vulnerable adults, functional numeracy is vital and critical.

For example, in an increasingly technologized age, algorithmic processes of machine learning are black boxes, even for those who produce them (Michael and Lupton 2016) .

A long-standing classification of ALE suggests that adult learning may occur in three contexts: formal, non-formal, and informal (Cedefop-European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training 2014); these are the contexts in which numeracy may develop as well.

Non-formal learning contexts offer many opportunities for lifelong numeracy learning, as when taking part in counseling to over-indebted persons (Angermeier and Ansen 2020), attending a company workshop or a retirement planning lecture at a commu-nity center, or participating in programs for economic empowerment of women or minority groups. \u2022 Informal learning may occur spontaneously, i.e., learning is usually non-intentional or governed by a structured educational process, but occurs as part of daily activities and is experiential in nature. Indeed, a well-known line of research refers to informal learning of mathematics, as in the literature on everyday cognition or 'street math' (Lave 1988) .

This implies the possibility of fragmentation of curricular schemes and heterogeneity of teacher qualifications. For example, trainers working in unemployment agencies do not need a teaching certificate, even though courses for job seekers have components on quality control and may involve some workplace mathematics, whereas trainers in some other adult education services (e.g., the German folk high schools) do not need to have formal certification, but can acquire qualifications through non-formal schemes.",

Later on, Condelli et al. (2006) confirmed this picture. Smith and Gillespie (2007) summarized the characteristics of adult basic education teachers in the USA as follows: they work mostly part-time, they leave the field more often than do school teachers, few have formal qualifications in teaching adults, though many are qualified and have taught in K-12, and they are not consistently funded to participate in in-service professional development. \u2022 In the UK, a review of the professional development and qualifications of adult educators revealed the inconsistent and poor background of teachers and the lack of systematic professional development opportunities (Morton et al. 2006 ). \u2022 Going beyond Germany, USA, and the UK, an OECD comparative review about the background, experience, and knowledge of adult literacy and numeracy teachers shows a consistent pattern across many different European countries (Windisch 2016) : Few teaching staff have formal qualifications in adult literacy and numeracy pedagogy.",

That said, second-chance schools, which provide basic qualifications to adults who have had little formal schooling (e.g., due to being migrants or refugees) and seek school completion certificates, often do teach mathematics as a separate subject, but following the standard curriculum for school students (Pavic and \u010cernja 2019). Furthermore, going beyond formal education to non-formal numeracy education, little is known about the content provided in in-house training that companies or worker unions provide for their employees or members, nor about teacher qualifications in such contexts (Kelly 2019) . Overall, the realities described above point to many systemic factors that can create sources of vulnerability from the point of view of numeracy learners and education providers alike, e.g., in terms of teacher qualifications and training, curriculum cohesion and relevance to adult learners. These realities show the need for much further systematic research that will map numeracy education pathways and evaluate the relative quality of education services across the many contexts in which adults may learn numeracy or mathematics, both formal and non-formal.",

Yet, the essence of vulnerability is also that it has an empirical aspect, i.e., it refers to the possibility and probability of getting hurt, where some members of a society are better protected than others from actually getting hurt, as revealed by empirical data (e.g., official statistics or comparative studies). Thus, vulnerability captures a seeming paradox that relates to the status of social groups that are part of society but are at increased risk of social, political, or economic exclusion or disadvantage (Streich 2009 ), though are not necessarily actually being excluded or disadvantaged (or are on a continuum of severity).",

The other end of the continuum would be the factual exclusion, e.g., longterm unemployment, which gradually leads to complete dropping out of the formal labor market.

This general and recurrent finding is noted and confirmed by many studies (Hanushek and Woessmann 2007; Liu et al. 2019 ). Educational services and training programs often target marginalized populations via national skills strategies (OECD 2019b) and various types of adult education programs. Numeracy is a foundational element in all such programs, alongside literacy and language skills. The discussion of vulnerability also raises moral questions since it calls on policy makers and social institutions to reduce the vulnerability of certain groups. For example, they have an ethical responsibility to combat poor living conditions or poor nutrition and improve health outcomes, or help those with needs due to skill shortages and employment gaps. The improvement of numeracy in specific domains of life discussed in Sect. 3, (i.e., health numeracy, financial numeracy, digital numeracy, civic numeracy, and workplace numeracy), are essential ingredients in this regard. These domains are, therefore, further revisited in the next subsection, and expanded beyond their initial description in Sect. 2.2.",

First, we examine whether the findings support the need to address separate numeracy domains, discussed in Sect. 2.2, in ways that also link with sources of vulnerability. Next, we examine whether the reported studies support ideas discussed in Sect. 2.3 regarding linkages between numeracy and literacy. Finally, we show how the findings support the proposal presented in Sect. 2.5 regarding the need to address both functional and critical aspects of numeracy of adults, and illustrate aspects of numeracy practices, a notion discussed in Sect. 2.4, and some aspects of adult learning and adult (numeracy) education, raised in Sect. 3.",

This term represents the degree to which individuals have the ability to access, process, interpret, communicate, and act on numerical, quantitative, graphical, bio-statistical, and probability-based health information (Golbeck et al. 2005) . Descriptions from qualitative data (Zeuner et al. 2020 ) on elderly adults indicate that health-oriented activities demand numeracy practices, e.g., probability checks (chances of recovery and risks of an operation), scaled self-observations (pain protocols), dosage tasks, or expenses and bonuses claimed from health insurers. Large-scale data confirm the relevance of health numeracy to adults' well-being. Based on a longitudinal study (PIAAC-L), Heilmann (2020) showed a relationship between aspects of health-related behavior (non-smoking, exercise, health-conscious nutrition) and basic numerical practices such as estimating measurements and calculating simple averages, as well as more complex numerical practices such as the interpretation of statistical data.",

For example, debt counselors who work with over-indebted people seeking advice (Angermeier 2019; Angermeier and Ansen 2020) point out that commercial and service providers often present product descriptions (e.g., credit offers, installment purchases, telephone and electricity bills) that make price comparisons difficult and require advanced numeracy skills. Grotl\u00fcschen et al. (2019b) show that complex financial decisions (retirement plans, tax returns) are less likely to be made by low-literate adults, while numeracy practices of over-indebted people (Grotl\u00fcschen et al. 2019a) involve the intense use of finance-oriented numeracy practices and skills.

New challenges range from understanding ubiquitous data collection, algorithmic decision making, and uses of 'big data' in prediction systems (Michael and Lupton 2016) . Citizens need to understand the potential contribution of such developments to inequality or discriminatory use, e.g., health insurance based on the probability of an improved situation (Smythe 2018) , and to distinguish advertisements from information and understand disinformation (European Commission 2018). Zuboff's (2019) recent theory on surveillance capitalism calls for critical awareness of how human behavior is predicted and modified based on personal data to benefit leading internet companies.

Cognitive skills and knowledge bases are core elements of numeracy from the point of view of educators and curriculum developers, and lead the conceptualization, teaching, and assessment of numeracy. Acting in a numerate way, however, also involves meta-cognitive elements (e.g., reflectiveness) as well as non-cognitive or semi-cognitive aspects (e.g., emotions, motivations, value judgments, personal views).",

Furthermore, as this paper and other papers in this issue demonstrate, numeracy practices occur in social and cultural contexts, and are affected by individuals' personal histories and prior learning trajectories. Numeracy and numerate behavior have also been shown to be interdependent both on language skills and on literacy practices.

This means, however, that numeracy must also be differentiated in the formulation of (adult) education policies and practices, as well as in educational research. This paper pointed to five domains in which separate but connected numeracies are needed by adults, related to digital, financial, health, civic, and the broad area of workplace numeracy. Each of these domains requires somewhat different knowledge bases, dispositions, and practices, although some issues cut across multiple domains. These five domains may be seen as functional, calling for pragmatic responses, yet they all also involve critical elements since they require the ability (and inclination) to raise questions, reflect critically, and communicate effectively about thoughts and concerns. Furthermore, based on Gal (1997) , each of these five domains requires not only computational, but also interpretive and decisional reactions, hence present higher task demands than may seem from a functional view of numeracy, and may require different teaching/learning processes.",

Some of the vulnerabilities are well known in the literature and pertain to personal characteristics (e.g., minority status, learning difficulties) or to situational and social barriers (e.g., economic conditions, social exclusion). Sections 3 and 4, however, contributed additional sources of vulnerability related to negative affective or motivational baggage that adults bring with them when they enter a learning program or engage with various numeracy tasks, as well as poor literacy skills. Other barriers are systemic and may pertain to the characteristics or resources of the learning programs that adults may enter. They also pertain to the qualifications and practices of teachers, their understanding of the unique aspects of teaching adults (rather than school children), and the understanding of how to promote numeracy-literacy links. All of these vulnerabilities can inform goals and policies in adult numeracy education.",

This is reflected, for instance, in the barrage of communications and data presented to the public worldwide regarding probabilities, risks, and quantitative projections associated with the recent Corona-virus (COVID-19) pandemic, and the resulting need for many interpretive and decisional reactions from citizens from all walks of life.
