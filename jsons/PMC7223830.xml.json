Nodes located in the upper mediastinum\u2014especially along the bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN)\u2014are common site of metastases in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). [1\u20133]. In this regard, the rate of metastases to RLN nodes has been shown to be as high as 20\u201340% after primary surgery in ESCC [1, 2, 4]. In general, dissection of nodes along the RLN is deemed to exert positive effects on clinical outcomes [2, 5]. However, RLN lymph-node dissection (LND) is not yet part of the routine surgical practice\u2014mainly because of the potential morbidity risks [6, 7]. Specifically, it has been reported that the rates of RLN palsy after such extensive nodal dissections could be as high as 60%\u2014potentially impairing quality of life, predisposing to serious postoperative complications (e.g., aspiration pneumonia), and even resulting in postoperative deaths [8\u201310].",

First, chemoradiation may clear occult lymph-node metastases, ultimately reducing the clinical usefulness of an extensive nodal dissection. Second, radiation therapy may induce mediastinal fibrosis, a complication which renders RLN LND even more hazardous. Unfortunately, no data are currently available on the clinical utility and implications of RLN nodal dissection in nCRT-treated patients with esophageal cancer.",

The study patients were divided into two groups according to the extent of LND [standard two-field LND (STL group) versus total two-field LND (TTL group)]. The classification of LND was based on the 1994 consensus conference of the International Society of Disease of Esophagus criteria [11]. Only lower mediastinal and upper abdominal lymph nodes were removed in the STL group. In addition to the standard procedure, patients in the TTL group underwent a bilateral resection of lymph nodes located along the RLN. Pretreatment staging was based on the results of chest and abdomen CT scans, PET imaging, and endoscopic ultrasound. Patient staging was performed according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging criteria, seventh edition (2010). The last follow-up date was December 31, 2018. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the local Institutional Review Board (CGMH-IRB-201800087B0).

            "text": "Previous studies have consistently shown that an extensive LND in patients with primarily resected esophageal cancer exerts beneficial effects by providing more accurate staging information and superior local control rates [5, 12\u201314]. However, the question as to whether the same concept can be applied to nCRT-treated cases remains open [15\u201317]. Because nCRT and extensive LND are both aimed at increasing local control rates, here, we specifically investigated whether the addition of the latter approach to the former could result in better oncological outcomes. Importantly, the thoroughness of LND does not only depend on the number of sampled nodes but also on their exact anatomical location [2]. For example, sampling of a few nodes from areas at high risk for metastases may result in a better oncological efficacy than an extensive LND in a location at low risk of nodal involvement. Upper mediastinal nodes\u2014especially located around RLN bilaterally\u2014represent the anatomical area with the highest risk of metastases after primary surgery in ESCC [1, 3]. In our sample of ESCC patients who had been treated with nCRT and did not show evidence of clinical RLN lymph-node involvement on the preoperative workup, the rate of RLN nodal metastases remained high (20.7%). Moreover, we were able to observe a 15% increase in the superior mediastinum recurrence rate among patients who did not receive bilateral RLN LND (i.e., the STL group). Albeit subject to future confirmation, our findings seem to suggest that RLN LND should be practiced as part of the surgical routine for ESCC patients after nCRT (even in the absence of positive nodes identified during the preoperative workup).",

Although we were able to demonstrate a low post-RLN LND morbidity in experienced hands, this approach remains time-consuming. Theoretically, selective removal of RLN lymph nodes would be desirable if specific risk factors could be identified preoperatively. Unfortunately, we were unable to find any significant predictor of RLN nodal involvement after nCRT. Previously reported risk factors for RLN LNM in primarily resected patients (e.g., tumor location or clinical stage) do not seem to have a significant predictive value in nCRT-treated cases. Of note, metastatic spread to the RLN nodes was also observed in patients who showed a pathological complete response at the primary tumor site (ypT0; Supplemental Table 1). The omission of such cases would have led to an erroneous classification of some ypT0N+ patients as ypT0N0, ultimately resulting in an incorrect prognostic stratification [18].",

First, because data collection was conducted retrospectively and the decision to perform RLN LND was not randomized, we cannot exclude a selection bias. Second, during the early study period when TTL has not yet been implemented as part of surgical routine, we used low-dose radiotherapy (30 Gy) combined with the PF regimen with the main goal of decreasing chemoradiotherapy toxicity. This has resulted in different radiation doses being delivered to the RLN LN area in two groups. Third, although we were able to observe a lower upper mediastinum nodal recurrence rate following TTL (compared with STL), the addition of RLN area into routine LND did not translate into a significantly better survival (possibly because of the small sample size). Future studies in larger cohorts are needed to confirm and expand our findings.",
