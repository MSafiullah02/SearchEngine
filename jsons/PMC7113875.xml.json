Accumulating evidence suggests camels to act as a zoonotic source of the virus (Reusken et al., 2013, Haagmans et al., 2014, Meyer et al., 2013). Limited human-to-human transmission of the virus has been described (Assiri et al., 2013). As of June 11, 2014, 683 cases of MERS have been reported, with 204 deaths (http://www.who.int). The clinical symptoms of MERS include severe pneumonia and sometimes acute renal failure (Eckerle et al., 2013). However, the majority of MERS patients had/has comorbidities, such as diabetes, lung disease, or chronic renal disease (Perlman, 2013).",

            "text": "SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV belong to the genus Betacoronavirus but pertain to highly distinct phylogenetic clades termed b and c, respectively (de Groot et al., 2013). In case of SARS-CoV, the best-characterized potential antiviral drug targets are the two viral proteases, the main protease (Mpro, also called 3C-like protease, 3CLpro) (Hilgenfeld and Peiris, 2013, Anand et al., 2003, Yang et al., 2003, Yang et al., 2005, Xu et al., 2005, Lu et al., 2006, Verschueren et al., 2008, Zhu et al., 2011, Kilianski et al., 2013) and the papain-like protease (PLpro) (Hilgenfeld and Peiris, 2013, Kilianski et al., 2013, Barretto et al., 2005, Ratia et al., 2006, Ratia et al., 2008, Baez-Santos et al., 2014). The latter enzyme exists in all coronaviruses (Woo et al., 2010) and has been shown to be responsible for releasing non-structural proteins (Nsp) 1, 2, and 3 from the N-terminal part of polyproteins 1a and 1ab. The three cleavage sites contain the sequence motif LXGG\u2193XX. In addition, the SARS-CoV PLpro has been shown to have deubiquitinating and interferon antagonism activities, thereby interfering with the host innate immune response (Barretto et al., 2005, Lindner et al., 2005, Devaraj et al., 2007, Frieman et al., 2009). Specifically, it can prevent the activation of IRF3 (interferon-regulatory factor 3) and antagonize the NF-\u03baB (nuclear factor \u03ba-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) pathway, but the detailed mechanisms involved are still unclear. Very recently, the MERS-CoV PLpro has been reported to also have proteolytic, deubiquitinating, and deISG15ylating activities in HEK293T cells (Yang et al., 2013, Mielech et al., 2014) (ISG15 = interferon-stimulated gene 15); it therefore also acts as an interferon antagonist through blocking the IRF3 pathway. Interestingly, these reports differ in their finding that the interferon-antagonizing activity of the MERS-CoV PLpro is either independent of (Yang et al., 2013) or dependent on (Mielech et al., 2014) its proteolytic activity.",

In the interest of an easy description, we renumber Gln1482 into Gln1 here. A gene coding for the PLpro was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the forward primer 5\u2032-CTAGCTAGCcagttaacaatcgaagtcttagtg-3\u2032 and the reverse primer 5\u2032-CCGCTCGAGttaatcgctactgtatttttggccggg-3\u2032. The resulting PCR product was digested with restriction enzymes NheI and XhoI for ligation into pET-28a (Novagen). Cloning was designed to include an N-terminal hexahistidine (His6) tag and a thrombin cleavage site. The recombinant plasmid was used to transform Escherichia coli strain Tuner (DE3) pLacI (Novagen). Transformed cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C overnight in LB medium, supplemented with kanamycin (50 \u03bcg/mL) and chloramphenicol (34 \u03bcg/mL). The culture was used to inoculate LB medium the day after. When the OD600 of the culture reached 0.6\u20130.8, overexpression of the PLpro gene was induced for 20 h with the addition of isopropyl-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG, final concentration 0.5 mM) at 20 \u00b0C. Subsequently, the culture was harvested by centrifugation for 30 min at \u223c7300\u00d7g and 4 \u00b0C. Cells were resuspended in 30 mL buffer A (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, pH 8.8, 10 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (BME)) and lysed by sonication on ice. The lysate was centrifuged for 1 h at \u223c48,000\u00d7g and 4 \u00b0C to remove the cell debris. The supernatant was applied to a HisTrap\u2122 nickel column (GE Healthcare) and the His-tagged protein was eluted with buffer B (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, pH 8.8, 10 mM BME) using standard protocols. The target protein was processed overnight by thrombin (Sigma) cleavage at 4 \u00b0C to remove the His-tag. Left with six extra residues (GSHMAS) at the N-terminus after this processing step, the PLpro was further purified by gel filtration (HiLoad\u2122 16/60 Superdex 200 column, GE Healthcare) using buffer C (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.8, 10 mM BME).",

Residues 283\u2013285 are at the C-terminus of strand \u03b216 and the two glycines are the central residues of a \u03b2-turn that leads into strand \u03b217, which starts with Leu288. Thus, the residues concerned are part of well-defined secondary-structure elements and therefore, although largely accessible to solvent, cannot be accommodated by the substrate-binding site of the protease. However, whether or not in-trans PLpro autocleavage occurs at this position in the viral polyprotein, remains to be investigated.",

            "text": "As the Ubl domain and the catalytic domain of the MERS-CoV PLpro are two independent domains, we treated them separately in searching the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for structural similarity using the DALI server (Holm and Rosenstr\u00f6m, 2010). However, we note that there are no variations in the relative orientation of these domains with respect to each other, as the Ubl domain is anchored to the core domain by two strong salt-bridges in MERS-CoV PLpro (Arg16...Glu64, 2.9 \u00c5; Asp39 \u2026 His81, 3.5 \u00c5) as well as in SARS-CoV PLpro (the TGEV PL1pro lacks the Ubl domain). The structural comparisons show that the MERS-CoV Ubl domain is similar to other proteins or domains featuring the ubiquitin fold (Table 2\n, Fig. 2\nA). The Ubl domain of SARS-CoV PLpro is essential for downregulating IRF3 or the NF-\u03baB antiviral signaling pathway, but the Ubl domain alone is not sufficient to do so (Frieman et al., 2009). On the other hand, the Ubl domain is often involved in protein\u2013protein interactions (Mueller and Feigon, 2003, Su and Lau, 2009, Hartmann-Petersen and Gordon, 2004) and it is conceivable that the Ubl domain of MERS-CoV PLpro could interfere with host signaling-pathway proteins by providing a binding scaffold, which is necessary for the catalytic domain to accomplish its function of antagonizing the host\u2019s innate immune response.",

            "text": "The catalytic domain of the MERS-CoV PLpro is more similar to that of the SARS-CoV (Ratia et al., 2006) than to the PL1pro of Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV; Wojdyla et al., 2010) (Table 2). There are four regions of significant structural difference between the coronaviral PLpros (Fig. 2B). The first (Region I) concerns the two helices \u03b12 and \u03b13 in the N-terminal region of the thumb domain of the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV enzymes, which are absent in the TGEV PL1pro (Figs. 2B and 3\n). The second region (II in Fig. 2B) of major structural differences concerns the four \u03b2-strands of the fingers domain. Two \u03b2-hairpins, which provide the cysteine residues for binding the structural zinc ion in this region, are twisted to different degrees among the three structures. The third structurally different area (III in Fig. 2B) is the connecting region between the fingers and palm domains. In the MERS-CoV PLpro, the C-terminal 10 residues of \u03b214 extend into the palm domain and an 8-residue loop (Thr257\u2013Val264) connects \u03b214 and \u03b215. In the SARS-CoV enzyme, the corresponding strand is divided into two separate \u03b2-strands, \u03b212 and \u03b213, the latter of which is mostly part of the palm domain, and a shorter loop formed by 5 residues (Gln256 - Leu260) connects \u03b213 and \u03b214. In the TGEV PL1pro, there are two loops (Ser157\u2013Thr160 and Val166\u2013Val170) and one 310-helix (Pro161\u2013Phe165) connecting the fingers and palm domains. The different connections in the various PLpros might lead to different mutual orientations of the two domains, which in turn might affect the enzymatic activities of the individual PLpros. Finally, Region IV (Fig. 2B) concerns the loop between \u03b215 and \u03b216 (Gly271\u2013Gly277), four residues of which are not defined by electron density in MERS-CoV PLpro. The corresponding region in TGEV PL1pro (Gly177\u2013Gly182) and in SARS-CoV PLpro (Gly267\u2013Gly272) is shorter by one residue compared to the MERS-CoV enzyme; it forms a loop between \u03b28 and \u03b29 in TGEV PL1pro and a short 310-helix between \u03b214 and \u03b215 in the SARS-CoV enzyme. However, this region is very flexible and adopts different positions in the three copies of the SARS-CoV PLpro in the asymmetric unit of the crystal (Ratia et al., 2006). In the recently reported crystal structure of the SARS-CoV PLpro (C112S mutant) in complex with ubiquitin (Chou et al., 2014), the \u03b214-\u03b215 loop shows large conformational differences compared to its position in the free enzyme. The two glycines framing this loop are absolutely conserved among the coronavirus PLpros, but the residues between them are different in each of the enzymes, suggesting that there must be differences in the interaction between the loop and the substrates.",

A side-by-side comparison of the catalytic domain of the MERS-CoV PLpro with USP14 is shown in Fig. 2C. The most significant differences are located in the connecting region between the fingers and palm domains. The two \u201cblocking loops\u201d, BL1 and BL2, of USP14 regulate the deubiquitinating activity (Hu et al., 2005) (Fig. 2C). BL1 of USP14 connects the fingers and palm domains. It is a 22-residue loop between \u03b28 and \u03b29, exposed to the substrate-binding surface. The corresponding loop in MERS-CoV PLpro is much shorter (8 residues) and connects \u03b214 and \u03b215. Furthermore, this short loop does not face the substrate-binding region but rather points to the bottom of the thumb domain of MERS-CoV PLpro (Fig. 2C), and can thus not be considered a \u201cblocking loop\u201d. As a consequence, the substrate-binding site (indicated by the black arrow in Fig. 2C) is larger in MERS-CoV PLpro than in the USPs, probably enabling the enzyme to not only bind ubiquitin but also viral polyprotein. Connecting \u03b210 and \u03b211, the other blocking loop, BL2 (residues Gly427\u2013Gly433), of USP14 is near the active site and undergoes conformational change upon substrate binding (Hu et al., 2005); this loop corresponds to \u03b215-\u03b216 (residues Gly271\u2013Gly277) of MERS-CoV PLpro which unfortunately lacks electron density for four of its seven residues (see above).",

His278 is located at the N-terminus of \u03b216; its N\u03b41 atom is 4.4 \u00c5 from the sulfur of Cys111. This large distance is likely due to the BME-modification of Cys111; in most papain-like protease structures, the distances are between 3.7 \u00c5 and 4.0 \u00c5 (Fig. 4A).

For example, the latter residue is Asn in USP14 and HAUSP (Hu et al., 2002, Hu et al., 2005), and Gln in the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCH)-L3 and UCH-L1 (Johnston et al., 1997). In TGEV PL1pro, there is also a glutamine residue (Gln27) at this position (Wojdyla et al., 2010). In SARS-CoV PLpro, the corresponding residue is Trp107, the indole NH of which has been proposed to stabilize the oxyanion transition state (Fig. 4B). Accordingly, replacing Trp by Ala abrogates the protease activity (Ratia et al., 2006).

(2006) have discussed Asn110 as a potential additional component of the oxyanion hole in the SARS-CoV PLpro. This residue is highly conserved amongst the coronaviral PLpros, including the MERS-CoV enzyme (Asn109) and in TGEV PL1pro (Asn30). In all three coronavirus PLpros of known three-dimensional structure as well as in USP14, this Asn residue occupies position i+2 of a \u03b2-turn (Ser107-Asp108-Asn109-Asn110 in MERS-CoV) that precedes the catalytic cysteine in the polypeptide chain. However, the side-chain of Asn109 is oriented away from the oxyanion hole and is involved in a strong (2.9 \u00c5) hydrogen-bond with the carbonyl oxygen of conserved Gly161 of the thumb subdomain (Fig. 4C); therefore, it is unlikely to undergo a conformational change that will bring it into the neighborhood of the catalytic center. The other two potential hydrogen-bonding donors in this \u03b2 -turn, Ser107 and Asn110, are heavily engaged in hydrogen bonds across the turn (Fig. 4C) and therefore equally unlikely to undergo the conformational changes necessary to reorient their side-chains towards the catalytic center.",

We notice that the segment between residues 108 (position i+1 of the \u03b2-turn) and 111 can be superimposed (with an RMSD of \u223c0.62 \u00c5 for main-chain atoms) onto the loop (142-NGSC-145) preceding the catalytic nucleophile, Cys145, in SARS-CoV main protease (Mpro; PDB: 2BX3, Tan et al., 2005) (Fig. 4D). The Mpro is a cysteine protease comprising a chymotrypsin-like fold; in these enzymes, the oxyanion hole is formed by the main-chain amides of the catalytic cysteine (or serine) and of the penultimate residue (Taranto et al., 2008, Wu et al., 2013). The penultimate residue before the catalytic nucleophile in chymotrypsin-like proteases is absolutely conserved as a glycine, whereas in MERS-CoV PLpro, the conserved Asn109 resides at this position. However, this asparagine is in a left-handed (\u03b1L) conformation, with positive \u03d5 and \u03c8 angles (56\u00b0 and 34\u00b0, resp.) in the Ramachandran plot, just like the conserved glycine in the catalytically competent conformation of chymotrypsin-like proteases (Verschueren et al., 2008, Tan et al., 2005). In fact, Asn and Asp are the only residues apart from Gly, for which this conformation is observed at a significant rate in protein structures (Hutchinson and Thornton, 1994). (Incidentally, in MERS-CoV PLpro, the i+1 residue of this \u03b2-turn, Asp108, is also in an \u03b1L conformation, so that we have the rare situation here of a \u03b2-turn with both i+1 and i+2 residues having positive \u03d5/\u03c8 angles). In spite of the Asn109 main-chain N atom being relatively well superimposable onto the corresponding atom of Gly143 in SARS-CoV Mpro, we note that the N-H vector of this amide does not point towards the position that would likely be assumed by the oxyanion. Whether or not the necessary (minor) rearrangement may occur, remains to be answered by elucidating the structure of a complex between the MERS-CoV PLpro and a transition-state analogue.",

The P1 and P2 positions are strictly conserved as glycine residues. P5 is Lys or Arg and P4 Leu or Ile, whereas P3 can be Ile, Lys, or Val. In the SARS-CoV polyprotein, cleavage by the PLpro also occurs behind LXGG, but X is either Asn or Lys (Barretto et al., 2005), never a hydrophobic residue such as Ile or Val as in MERS-CoV. The LXGG motif is also present at the C-terminus of ubiquitin. In addition to the crystal structure of the complex between the C112S mutant of SARS-CoV PLpro and ubiquitin (Chou et al., 2014), the structure of the wild-type SARS-CoV PLpro with Ubal has very recently been reported (Ratia et al., 2014; Ubal is ubiquitin with the C-terminal carboxylate reduced to an aldehyde, which forms a covalent bond with the catalytic Cys residue). However, as the PDB coordinates for the latter structure have not been released yet, we rely for our further discussion on the structures of the ubiquitin complex of the SARS-CoV PLpro (C112S mutant) and on the structure of USP14-Ubal; Hu et al., 2005). The structural homology between these two enzymes and MERS-CoV PLpro allowed us to deduce conclusions concerning the substrate-binding site of the latter. When we superimposed the substrate-binding sites of MERS-CoV PLpro, SARS-CoV PLpro(C112S), and USP14, we found a remarkable degree of structural conservation but also some important differences (Fig. 5\n).",

In the SARS-CoV PLpro(C112S)-Ub and SARS-CoV PLpro-Ubal complexes (Chou et al., 2014, Ratia et al., 2014), the main-chain amide of P3-Arg (substrate residues are indicated in italics in what follows) forms an H-bond with the side-chain OH of Tyr265 (Fig. 5A and S1A). In MERS-CoV PLpro, this residue is replaced by Phe269 (Fig. 5C and D). Replacement of Tyr265 by Phe in SARS-CoV PLpro reduces the peptidolytic activity of the enzyme by a factor of 2.4 and its deubiquitinating activity by 57% (Chou et al., 2014). Another potentially important difference between the S3 subsites of SARS-CoV PLpro and MERS-CoV PLpro is that Glu162 of the former is replaced by Ala162 in the latter (Fig. 5A and C), reducing the negative electrostatic potential of this region in the MERS-CoV PLpro (Fig. 5E and F).

In addition, the mobile \u03b2 15\u2013\u03b2 16 loop probably contributes to the S4 site (as deduced from the structure of SARS-CoV PLpro in complex with ubiquitin (Chou et al., 2014)), but we are unable to provide a detailed description because of missing electron density (see above). In any case, however, the loop of the MERS-CoV enzyme is devoid of a large aromatic residue that could make interactions with Leu73 (P4) (and Leu71 (P6)) of ubiquitin, as observed for Tyr269 of SARS-CoV PLpro (Chou et al., 2014).",

The side-chain of the P5-Arg forms a salt-bridge with Glu201 in the USP14-Ubal complex (Hu et al., 2005; Fig. 5B and S1B) and the same is observed for Glu168 of SARS-CoV PLpro with Ubal (Ratia et al., 2014). However, in the SARS-CoV PLpro(C112S) complex with ubiquitin (Chou et al., 2014), this same glutamate residue interacts with an arginine of the core of ubiquitin (Arg42) instead of the P5-Arg (Fig. 5A). This may be due to the position of Glu168 and hence the entire S5 site of the PLpro at the surface of the protease, near the entrance to the substrate-binding cleft. While not forming a pocket, the S5 is still important for substrate binding, because the Glu168 side-chain is at the core of a region with pronounced negative electrostatic potential (see Fig. 5E). Interestingly, this important glutamate of USP14 and SARS-CoV PLpro is replaced by Arg168 in MERS-CoV PLpro (Fig. 5D), changing the electrostatic potential of the S5 site of the latter to more positive and therefore less ideal for interacting with the P5-Arg or Arg42 of ubiquitin, or the P5 Lys/Arg of the MERS-CoV polyprotein cleavage sites (Fig. 5F). Indeed, Chou et al. (2014) have replaced Glu168 of SARS-CoV PLpro by Arg and found a 25-fold decrease in deubiquitinating activity of the enzyme.",

As there are important differences in the S3 subsite as well as in the mobile loop between the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV PLpros, it is unlikely that these compounds will inhibit the PLpro and the replication of MERS-CoV.

For this assay (and the one described below), only freshly prepared enzyme was used, in which the catalytic cysteine residue was shown to be in a free, reduced (and hence active) state by titration with Ellman\u2019s reagent and by the absence of an effect of adding EDTA up to a concentration of 10 mM (see Materials & Methods). We found that the peptides were hydrolyzed by MERS-CoV PLpro\nin vitro, and that the initial rate of hydrolysis increased with raising the substrate concentration. However, we were unable to observe saturation of the reactions. This might indicate a large Km value and/or low enzyme efficiency. We used the pseudo-first-order rate constant, kapp, to estimate an approximate kcat/Km value. The kapp rates were 1.31 \u00b1 0.14 min\u2212\n1\n mM\u22121 for Z-RLRGG-AMC and 1.00 \u00b1 0.01 min\u22121\n mM\u22121 for Z-LRGG-AMC, values significantly lower than those reported for the SARS-CoV PLpro (Table 3\n). This may be explained by the apparent deficiency of the oxyanion hole of the MERS-CoV PLpro and the inability of the side-chain of Phe269 to form the hydrogen bond with the main-chain amide of P3-Arg observed for the corresponding Tyr265 in SARS-CoV PLpro (Chou et al., 2014). In order to examine whether this relatively low activity is caused by the deficiency of the oxyanion hole, i.e. the lack of a side-chain available for oxyanion stabilization through hydrogen bonding, we prepared the L106W mutant of the MERS-CoV PLpro and found its peptide-hydrolyzing activities on Z-RLRGG-AMC and Z-LRGG-AMC, respectively, to be 40-fold and 60-fold higher than those of the wild-type enzyme (Table 3). This is a clear demonstration of the deficiency of the oxyanion hole in the MERS-CoV PLpro and shows that the contribution to oxyanion stabilization by the main-chain amide of residue 109, if at all existent, is far less efficient than by a tryptophan residue in position 106, as found in the SARS-CoV PLpro.",

This value is also lower than the rate constants reported for SARS-CoV PLpro by different research groups (Table 3). Again, the less-than-perfect oxyanion hole and the replacement of Tyr265 of SARS-CoV PLpro by Phe269 in MERS-CoV PLpro may be responsible for this. In addition, the replacement of Glu168 of SARS-CoV PLpro by Arg168 in the MERS-CoV enzyme very likely weakens the interaction with ubiquitin. The deubiquitinating activity of the MERS-CoV PLpro carrying the L106W mutation was found to be 3.4-fold higher than that of the wild-type enzyme (Table 3).

The distance between N\u03b41 of His278 and the sulfur of Cys111 in MERS-CoV PLpro is indicated. CME111: Cys111 covalently modified by \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. (B) Superposition (stereo view) of the polypeptide segment preceding the catalytic cysteine in MERS-CoV PLpro (106-LSDNN(CME)-111, green, shown as thick sticks, with bold green labels) and SARS-CoV PLpro (107-WADNNC-112, purple, thin sticks, smaller purple labels). (C) Stereo view of the same \u03b2-turn, Ser107-Asp108-Asn109-Asn110, in MERS-CoV PLpro, with the corresponding 2Fo-Fc electron density (blue; contoured at 1.5 \u03c3 above the mean). The main chain of the \u03b2-turn and of the (modified) catalytic residue CME111 is shown in pink, while side-chains are green. Gly161, Lys105 (main chain), and Trp93 (side-chain) are displayed as well. Hydrogen bonds are indicated by dashed red lines. (D) Stereo view of a superposition of 108-DNN(CME)-111 in MERS-CoV PLpro (green) and 142-NGSC-145 in SARS-CoV Mpro (gray, PDB: 2BX3, Tan et al., 2005). Residues of MERS-CoV PLpro and SARS-CoV Mpro (in brackets) are labeled. The RMSD of all main-chain atoms between this pair of four residues is \u223c0.62 \u00c5. The two black arrows point to the presumable position of the oxyanion in the transition state of the proteolytic reaction.",

            "text": "Fig. 5: Substrate-binding site of MERS-CoV PLpro as deduced from the homologous structures of SARS-CoV PLpro and USP14. (A) The substrate-binding site in SARS-CoV PLpro (purple, PDB: 4M0W (complex with ubiquitin), Chou et al., 2014). The five C-terminal residues of ubiquitin, RLRGG, are displayed as cyan sticks. Ubiquitin residues are labeled by cyan letters in italics, and residues of SARS-CoV PLpro involved in binding the C-terminal residues of ubiquitin are labeled with black regular letters. The salt-bridge Glu168 \u2026 Arg42 and the hydrogen bond Tyr265 \u2026 Arg74 are highlighted in insets. (B) The substrate-binding site of USP14 (red, PDB: 2AYO, complex with ubiquitin-aldehyde, Hu et al., 2005). The five C-terminal residues of ubiquitin, RLRGG-aldehyde, in the complex are displayed as blue sticks (GLZ, amino-acetaldehyde, i.e. the aldehyde of the C-terminal G76). The P1-P5 residues of ubiquitin are labeled by blue letters in italics. Residues of USP14 involved in binding the C-terminal residues of ubiquitin are labeled with regular black letters. The covalent bond between sulfur (Cys113) and carbon (GLZ76) is displayed by a green line. The salt-bridge Glu201 \u2026 Arg72 is highlighted in the inset. (C) The substrate-binding site of MERS-CoV PLpro. Residues that are different from those of SARS-CoV PLpro and USP14 are underlined. The supposed positions of the subsites S1\u2013S5 are indicated. (D) Structure-based alignment of residues involved in defining specificity subsites in MERS-CoV PLpro, SARS-CoV PLpro, and USP14. Conserved residues are in red. Arg168 of MERS-CoV PLpro (corresponding to Glu168 and Glu201 in SARS-CoV PLpro and USP14, respectively) is in blue. Phe269 of the MERS-CoV enzyme (Tyr265 in SARS-CoV PLpro) is green. Residues involved in shaping subsites are labeled by the symbol for the corresponding subsite (S1\u2013S5) above the alignment. Residues contributing to S1, S2, and S4, but not S3 and S5, are conserved. (E, F) Electrostatic surfaces of the substrate-binding regions of SARS-CoV PLpro (E) and MERS-CoV PLpro (F), colored according to electrostatic potential (blue, positive potential; red, negative potential). The electrostatic surfaces were calculated using the APBS plugin in PyMOL (Baker et al., 2001). The contouring level is -8 kBT/e to 8 kBT/e. Orientation is the same as in the cartoon representations in (A and C). The S3 and S5 subsites are indicated by orange labels. (E) Glu162 and Glu168 of SARS-CoV PLpro are marked. (F) Ala162 and R168 of MERS-CoV PLpro are marked.",
