Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of 26\u201332 kb, the largest genomes of all RNA viruses currently known, that replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells. The genome associates with the nucleoprotein (N) forming a helical nucleocapsid within the virus particles.

IBV replicates primarily in the respiratory tract but also in many other epithelial surfaces including oviducts, enteric surfaces, and kidneys [4\u20137]. Following infection with IBV, egg production and quality may be impaired in layers and weight gain in broilers is reduced [8]. Infected birds are predisposed to secondary bacterial infections such as colibacillosis and mortality in young chicks is not uncommon. Fecal excretion of the virus is a consequence of replication in the intestinal tract; however, this does not normally result in clinical disease.",

According to a new market research report published by MarketsandMarkets, the global poultry meat market was worth $179,551.2 million in 2012 and is expected to reach $250,949.5 million by 2018. In a report, commissioned by Defra in 2005 [12], IBV was indicated as a major cause of ill health among chickens and was implicated as being responsible for more economic loss in the UK poultry industry than any other disease [13, 14]; IBV was estimated to cost the UK economy nearly \u00a319 million per year, mainly due to loss of egg production, with serious implications for animal welfare. The cost of control through vaccination is approximately \u00a35 million per year in the UK.",

Coronavirus genomes consist of single-stranded positive-sense RNA, and are the largest of all the RNA viruses ranging from approximately 27\u201332 kb; the genome of IBV is 27.6 kb. Molecular analysis of the role of individual genes in the pathogenesis of RNA viruses has been advanced by the availability of full-length cDNAs, for the generation of infectious RNA transcripts that can replicate and result in infectious viruses. The assembly of full-length coronavirus cDNAs was hampered due to regions from the replicase gene being unstable in bacteria. We therefore devised a reverse genetics strategy for IBV involving the insertion of a full-length cDNA copy of the IBV genome, under the control of a T7 RNA promoter, into the vaccinia virus genome in place of the thymidine kinase (TK) gene. A hepatitis \u03b4 ribozyme (H\u03b4R) is located downstream of the coronavirus poly(A) tail followed by a T7 termination sequence. IBV infectious RNA is generated from the T7 promoter immediately adjacent to the 5\u2032 end of the IBV cDNA using T7 RNA polymerase and terminates at the T7 termination sequence downstream of the H\u03b4R sequence, which autocleaves itself and the T7 termination sequence at the end of the poly(A) sequence, resulting in an authentic IBV genomic RNA copy. Infectious IBV is recovered in situ in cells both transfected with vaccinia virus DNA and infected with a recombinant fowlpox virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase [15].",

A second and equally important advantage is the ability to modify the IBV cDNA within the vaccinia virus vector through transient dominant selection (TDS), a method taking advantage of recombinant events between homologous sequences [17, 18]. The TDS method relies on a three-step procedure. In the first step, the modified IBV cDNA is inserted into a plasmid containing a selective marker under the control of a vaccinia virus promoter. In our case we use a plasmid, pGPTNEB193 (Fig. 1; [19]), which contains a dominant selective marker gene, Escherichia coli guanine phosphoribosyltransferase\n(Ecogpt\n; [20]), under the control of the vaccinia virus P7.5K early/late promoter.\n",

This occurs as a result of a single crossover event involving homologous recombination between the IBV cDNA in the plasmid and the IBV cDNA sequence in the vaccinia virus genome. The resulting recombinant vaccinia viruses (rVV) are highly unstable due to the presence of duplicate sequences and are only maintained by the selective pressure of the Ecogpt\ngene, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid (MPA) in the presence of xanthine and hypoxanthine [17]. In the third step, the MPA -resistant rVVs are grown in the absence of MPA selection, resulting in the loss of the Ecogpt\ngene due to a second single homologous recombination event between the duplicated sequences (Fig. 3). During this third step two recombination events can occur; one event will result in the generation of the original (unmodified) IBV sequence and the other in the generation of an IBV cDNA containing the desired modification (i.e., the modification within the plasmid sequence). In theory these two events will occur at equal frequency; however in practice this is not necessarily the case.\n\n",

In addition, a plasmid, pCi-Nuc [15, 22], expressing the IBV nucleoprotein (N), under the control of both the cytomegalovirus (CMV) RNA polymerase II promoter and the T7 RNA promoter, is co-transfected into the CK cells. Expression of T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of the IBV N protein and the rVV DNA, containing the full-length IBV cDNA under the control of a T7 promoter, results in the generation of infectious IBV RNA, which in turn results in the production of infectious rIBVs (Fig. 4). Primary CK cells are refractory for growth of most IBV isolates; therefore rIBVs expressing S glycoproteins from such isolates cannot be recovered using CK cells. In order to recover such rIBVs, the supernatants from the transfected CK cells are used to infect 10-day-old embryonated hen\u2019s eggs. Allantoic fluid is collected and any potential virus passed a further three times in 10-day-old embryos. RNA is extracted from the allantoic fluid of infected eggs and RT-PCR followed by sequencing is used to confirm the identity of the rIBV.\n",

            "text": "\nVaccinia virus is classified as a category 2 human pathogen and its use is therefore subject to local regulations and rules that have to be followed.Always discard any medium of solution containing vaccinia virus into a 1% solution of Virkon; leave at least 12 h before discarding.Flasks of cells infected with vaccinia virus should be kept in large plastic boxes, which should be labeled with the word vaccinia and biohazard tape. A paper towel should be put on the bottom of the boxes to absorb any possible spillages.During centrifugation of vaccinia virus-infected cells use sealed buckets for the centrifugation to avoid possible spillages.After 2 h of incubation with the transfection mixture, the cells begin to die. It is best therefore not to exceed 90-min incubation.It is important that after the addition of each selection agent, the medium is mixed to ensure that the selection agents are evenly distributed. This can be achieved by gently rocking/swirling the plate.Add an equal volume of 2% agar to the 2\u00d7 EMEM containing MPA , xanthine, and hypoxanthine and mix well before adding it to vaccinia virus-infected cells. There is skill to making the overlay medium and adding it to the cells before the agar sets. There are a number of methods including adding hot agar to cold medium, or pre-warming the medium to 37 \u00b0C and adding agar that has been incubated at 50 \u00b0C. Despite the method chosen it is important that all components of the overlay medium are mixed well, and the medium is not too hot when it is added to the cells. If there are problems, 1% agar can be substituted with 1% low-melting agarose.The first recombinant event in the TDS system will not necessarily occur in the same place in every rVV . It is therefore important to pick a number of plaques from the first round of plaque purification in the presence of GPT selection agents and take a variety of them forward. The following two rounds of plaque purification in the presence of GPT selection agents ensure a single virus population and also that no carry through of the input receiver/wild-type vaccinia virus has occurred.Previous chapters and protocols have instructed during plaque purification in the absence of GPT selection agents to plate 10\u22121 rVV dilution in the presence of GPT selection medium and rVV dilutions 10\u22122 and 10\u22123 in the absence. When there are no plaques in the 10\u22121 dilution, it means that the rVV has lost the GPT gene and the plaques are ready to amplify and check for the presence of mutations.There are risks associated with working with phenol/ chloroform/ isoamyl alcohol and chloroform. It is important to check the local COSHH guidelines and code of practices.Vaccinia virus DNA is a very large molecule that is very easy to shear; therefore when working with the DNA be gentle and use wide-bore tips or cut the ends off ordinary pipette tips. In addition always store vaccinia virus DNA at 4 \u00b0C; do not freeze as this leads to degradation. However, there is an exception to this if the vaccinia virus DNA has been extracted using the Qiagen QlAamp DNA mini kit, as this DNA will have already been sheared (the kit only purifies intact DNA fragments up to 50 bp). This DNA can be stored at \u221220 \u00b0C but it is only suitable for analysis of the rVV genome by PCR and is not suitable for the infection and transfection of CK cells for the recovery of rIBV.There is always the possibility that the recovered rIBV is not cytopathic. In this case, check for the presence of viral RNA by RT-PCR at passage 3 (P3). It is quite common even with a cytopathic rIBV not to see easily definable IBV-induced CPE at P1 and P2. The recovery process is a low-probability event and the serial passage of rIBVs in CK cells acts as an amplification step.\n",
