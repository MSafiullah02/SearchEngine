At home every sniffle or cough elicits a brief pang of fear. To fight the deadly virus, we are turning to methods that proved partly effective in the flu epidemic of 1918. We have learned a new term-social distancing.",

To do the best for the most vulnerable among us, the right response is to shut the doors and hunker down. It's just the opposite of the best medical intentions to reach out, to touch, and to help. Yet the time will come, and for some the time is now, when those intentions rise again to action. Perhaps we can take a lesson from these days of isolation to remember how human flourishing depends on social life.",

            "text": "There is another pandemic called atherosclerosis that claims millions of lives annually worldwide. It's so familiar that we are apt to forget it in these extraordinary days. Yet we can point to signs of success. I have 2 brothers whose livelihood has depended partly on performing coronary bypass surgery. I recall my surprise early in my medical career when this complex operation became the most commonly performed surgery in the US. By 2000 one brother told me that the pace of performing coronary bypass procedures was declining about 1% per year. That pace has accelerated. Since 2003 the annual number of bypass procedures has dropped by 50%. The annual number of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) by cardiologists is a little more than twice the rate of bypass procedures. PCI volume has likewise dropped by half since 2003. 1 So we find ourselves facing an old type of communicable disease today, yet gaining substantial success in battling the most prevalent modern deadly pathology in both developed and emerging economies in the world. In particular, medical, dietary, and lifestyle interventions are working to diminish the impact of atherosclerosis, signaled by far less need for invasive procedures. Preventive cardiology and lipidology are rising. Joint efforts and international cooperation make the mission particularly satisfying.",

South Asians comprise 25% of world population, but suffer 50% of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events. Dr Raman Puri and colleagues have founded the India Lipid Association, and this issue marks the publication in JCL of their online-only, open access expert consensus document applicable to LDL cholesterol goals in India. They discuss potential expanded use of PCSK9 inhibitors to meet LDL cholesterol goals as low as #30 mg/dL. 2 You will also find in these pages a discussion of the sphingolipid ceramide as an atherosclerotic risk factor, illustrative cases including a woman with intermittent autoimmune chylomicronemia, advice on how to differentiate familial from multifactorial chylomicronemia, a suggestion that ABCG5/G8 heterozygous pathogenic variants may contribute to familial hypercholesterolemia, ascertainment of hurdles facing cascade screening and pediatric cholesterol screening, and several other new aspects of clinical lipidology.",
