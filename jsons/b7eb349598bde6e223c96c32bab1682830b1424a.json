In this editorial, we build on existing research about computational thinking to discuss it as a multi-faceted theoretical nature. We further present computational thinking, as a model of thinking, that is important not only in computer science and mathematics, but also in other disciplines of STEM and integrated STEM education broadly.",

Based on our proposed notion of \"everyone designs and can design\" (Li et al. 2019a) , we further discussed how existing research supports this notion with evidence of mutual benefits between design and STEM education.",

We discuss how our definition connects with each of these three approaches. We conclude by describing how CT is distinct from other models of thinking like design thinking.

For example, students might simply memorize the subtraction algorithm and know how to compute, say, 45-21, as \"subtracting a small digit from a larger digit,\" getting the correct answer, 24. But, without the needed understanding of place value and base-10 number composition and decomposition, then, a student might well carry out the computation 41-25 but get the same answer of 24. Here, we highlight the words of \"making sense\" and \"understanding,\" as they require thinking beyond rote computation. Helping students to develop such deeper understanding has long been advocated and emphasized (e.g., CCSSI 2010; NCTM 1989) , and also practiced in school mathematics such as the use of \"number talks\" (e.g., Parrish 2011).",

CT would be then emphasizing the importance of thinking and understanding in and for doing computation. The notion of CT might well be readily accepted for its importance to every student in learning mathematics. And yet, mathematics educators already have other terms that convey similar meaning, such as \"number sense\" (e.g., Sowder 1992) and \"symbol sense\" (Arcavi 1994) . But, then, why should this new term have any particular importance beyond other, older ones? Why should the importance of CT be advocated by computer scientists as important to everyone, when computation in mathematics is commonly taken as a basic skill? 1 Viewing CT as Specifically for Computer Scientists or Merely Learning how to Use a Computer Widespread association with computers or programming can easily lead people to perceive CT as specifically for computer science professionals. It would therefore be difficult for many to understand why CT is important to everyone. Certainly programming-at least in the way it is perceived from the work of professional programmersis considered difficult and esoteric. Developing software for a computer's internal operations would then be important to professionals in computer science, but out of reach to many others. In the same way, abstraction and modeling with the use of CT in many professional fields beyond computer science would be seen as unimportant and of marginal concern for most people.

Here, information can take different formats, at different levels of abstraction, and thus appears as various representations that can be customized and used in different disciplines for problem solving, modeling, and system building.

Although computation was in existence long before the creation of computers, the development of computation has experienced tremendous changes over the years associated with the invention and use of computers. Denning (2007) summarized the revolution in three main stages: (1) computation as a tool for performing simple and well-structured tasks, such as solving equations and running simulations, together with the creation and use of the first electronic digital computers in the 1940s; (2) computation used not only as a tool but also a method for discovering new knowledge beginning in the 1980s; and (3) computation and information processing found in the deep structures of many different fields beginning in the 2000s, such as biology, physics, and business management.

Examples include the Elementary Perceiver and Memorizer (EPAM, Feigenbaum and Simon 1984) , and adaptive control of thoughtrational (ACT-R, Anderson et al. 2004; Anderson and Lebiere 1998) . At the same time, the approach was restricted in the sense that it did not really conceptualize CT at all, but used computation as a tool to help with research about human cognition. As discussed in the previous editorial (Li et al. 2019b ), Simon expanded the information processing model of \"problem solving man\" from Human Problem Solving (Newell and Simon 1972) to the notion of \"thinking man\" in the book Models of Thought (Simon 1979 ).

Taking it positively, people view CT as relevant to many different professional activities, especially in different fields of STEM.

Instead of discussing possible clarifications that may be needed, Grover and Pea focused on how others might have interpreted Wing's description of CT. The review provided a nice summary of ongoing efforts from professional organizations and studies that aim to develop CT through programming and computer science in K-12 education. Grover and Pea also highlighted and discussed that tremendous efforts are needed in developing programs and research further in a broad range of topic areas including curriculum, instruction, assessment, and teacher education.",

            "text": "(2) Another approach is to propose and discuss possible expansion of CT beyond computer science. For example, a recent report Charting a Course for Success: America's Strategy for STEM Education, released by the White House in December 2018, included CT, digital literacy, and computational literacy when laying out the vision for the United States to success in STEM education (Committee on STEM Education 2018). With the increasing use and importance of digital devices and the internet, the committee envisioned the importance of \"digital literacy\" as a basic level of understanding and \"computational literacy\" as a higher level of skill for all students to benefit from what technology development can bring for tomorrow's job opportunities. Building computational literacy was taken as one of the four pathways to success in STEM education, with \"make computational thinking an integral element of all education\" listed as one of three objectives under this pathway. Although possible relationships among computational literacy, CT, and digital literacy were not explained in the report, computational literacy was seemingly taken as having a broader scope than CT. The meaning of CT was explained first in the report with the definition from Wing (2014) , and then expanded as including some broadly valuable thinking skills beyond computer science: evaluating information, breaking down a problem, and developing a solution through the use of data and logic. In fact, this expanded description shares many similarities with George P\u00f3lya's work on problem solving. With this expansion, the report further indicated the importance of developing students' CT as an integral part of all education with or without the use of a computer. (3) There is one other approach that aims to highlight the importance of computation for students' learning beyond programming. diSessa (2000) advocated the notion of computational literacy before Wing's promotion of computational thinking, and also took a principled approach in emphasizing both \"cognitive\" and \"social\" aspects rather just focusing on programming and the computer environment. Different from the popular use of literacy that many may perceive as \"a casual acquaintance with \u2026,\" diSessa (2018) defined literacy as a massive intellectual accomplishment of a culture together with a grand \"re-mediation,\" shifting and expanding the fundamental forms of representation in society to include computation as universally known and used. Similar to the way algebra and calculus transformed the study of physics from a philosophical inquiry to a rigorous, precise empirical pursuit (diSessa 2000), computation not only supports many different fields (not just computer science) but can also change the very intellectual landscape of fields in what they do and how they develop. diSessa (2018) thus viewed computational literacy as important to every student, but not in the same way as Wing (2006) . In his view, computation is not the special province of computer scientists, and everyone does not need to think like a computer scientist. Instead, computation is a fundamental resource for all of society, and it will develop earmarks that distinguish it in the way it is useful in each discipline and also in the larger, public society.",

I rarely use algebra to solve everyday mathematical problems because it's so much easier just to write a program. I prefer to write a program to compute, say, compound interest than to use a formula because (1) it's much faster than looking up or re-deriving the formula, (2) I can decide whether I want just a single result, a chart of gain over time, or a graph, and (3) I don't need to make any simplifying assumptions, such as a constant rate of return. To exemplify the last, in planning financially for our sons' college I wrote a little program that included both of our sons' expected tuition and board (and relevant dates), our estimated savings rate, raises in my wife's and my salaries, and also expected large purchases, such as a new car.",

With social distancing, that number should decrease. 7 It took me maybe 20 minutes to assemble what I needed, including finding an old graphing utility I had laying around, and also writing some new but simple utility functions. I keep mentioning speed because: (1) People who don't program don't know how easily such things can be done. (2) I would not do these things with programming if I knew a faster way to do them. I have no ideological commitment to programming just because it can be done. I do it if and when it's the fastest, easiest way I know to solve the problems I have.",

The graph starts on March 18-two days after social distancing was instituted-and continues until March 29 of 2020. This is a plot of log values of the data, since exponentials (which is the form of unfettered, constant infection rate growth) then appear as straight lines. The key lesson here is that, at the beginning of this time period, the slope of CA infections is significantly less than the US as a whole. That's what I expected to see. Selfishly, it's what I hoped for. To avoid confusion, note that I scaled the CA data so that it precisely matched the US at the beginning, just so that I could easily compare slope, there. (Rescaling and then applying the log function just provides a constant vertical shift; log ay = log a + log y.)",

While the blue (CA) graph is fairly straight, with the possible exception of a small downturn in the final two days, a colleague pointed out that it is a little jagged. It turns out that the jagginess is too much to be random error (1 / root N). But, a day later I read in the paper that California had been having trouble collecting data. Apparently, some counties were not reporting, or not reporting in a form that could be imported into the state's data bases. That fact may resolve the puzzle of jagginess. But, it's also true that the graph is as good as the data. I used: https://ncov2019.live. Finally, I could not get to the site at exactly the same time of day each day, and the data was continuously updating.",

This is what I was hoping to see, even if I expected more than this little change. On the other hand, a change in infection rate should show up after about two weeks, so we are just edging into that regime. Yesterday, the day after I noticed the slight downturn in infection rates, I saw an article in the San Francisco Chronicle, entitled \"Coronavirus slowing in Bay Area? Experts track data to see whether shelter in place is working.\" The article said: By day's end Monday [tomorrow], most of the Bay Area will have been holed up in their homes for two weekslong enough, experts say, to see whether the unprecedented efforts to keep people apart are beginning to halt, or at least slow down, the coronavirus.",

I could not even find any historical data listing, so that I have had to enter each day's data by hand and keep my own historical dataset. These failures of the on-line world to give me what I wanted are cultural failures of our society with respect to supporting widespread computational literacy.

We looked at the graphs, thought about how and why that happened (it's exponential decay; instead of change being proportional to amount (infections), change in temperature is proportional to the difference of temperatures). We then collaboratively developed a program embodying their model. In diSessa (2017) you can read about how one group of high school students developed, on their own and with no instruction, a normative model of temperature equilibration. In diSessa (2008) you can read several cases of students building conceptual and computational models of fundamental scientific principles, including early versions of our temperature equilibration curriculum unit. Indeed, in a later edition of the same project, we did teach eight grade students (from a marginalized, immigrant population) how to think about exponential growth (in the form of spreading rumors; \"each one tells two\").",
