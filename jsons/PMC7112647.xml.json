The severity of CAP depends on host factors (ie, cardiopulmonary function), immune system status (ie, splenic function), and, in some cases, the virulence of the pathogen. Patients with preexisting severe cardiac or pulmonary disease, if pneumonia develops, may present with severe CAP. Superimposed CAP stresses already compromised cardiopulmonary function and may manifest clinically as severe CAP. Even relatively avirulent pathogens (eg, M. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis) may manifest as severe CAP in patients with impaired cardiopulmonary function. With CAP caused by encapsulated bacteria (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae), splenic function is the primary determinant of CAP severity. Any of the above factors alone or in combination in immunocompetent hosts may present clinically as severe CAP. Nonetheless, some pathogens are inherently highly virulent and often present as severe CAP. All other things being equal, CAP is likely to be severe in patients with Legionnaire's disease, influenza, systemic acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS), hanta pulmonary virus syndrome (HPS), or adenovirus.8, 9, 10\n",

However, rapid influenza testing and respiratory viral fluorescent antibody panel were negative for influenza and other respiratory viruses. Viral influenza and adenoviral titers were also negative. Because he was an immunocompetent host, CMV was not an initial diagnostic consideration.5, 6 The possibility of CMV was later considered in view of some of his otherwise unexplained laboratory findings, for example, atypical lymphocytosis (5%-13%) and increased serum transaminases (serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase = 103-331 IU/L, n = 13-39 IU/L; serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase = 164-441 IU/L, n = 4-36 IU/L). Diagnostic bronchoscopy was performed, and cytology was negative for HSV-1 and CMV. Viral cultures of bronchial washings were negative for CMV. Because the diagnosis was confirmed after the patient's recovery, which was slow and prolonged, he was not treated for CMV CAP.",

Those with focal chest x-ray infiltrates without a large A-a gradient (<35) have severe CAP usually as the result of impaired cardiopulmonary/splenic function. The pathogens causing severe CAP with focal chest x-ray infiltrates without a large diffusion defect (ie, A-a gradient < 35) are the typical bacterial CAP pathogens: S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, M. pneumoniae, and C. pneumoniae. In contrast, in patients presenting with severe CAP with focal chest x-ray infiltrates and a large A-a gradient (>35), Legionnaire's disease or, less commonly, adenoviral CAP is the primary diagnostic consideration. If a patient presents with severe CAP and no or minimal infiltrates, when accompanied by a large A-a gradient (>35), then an interstitial infectious process should be considered. Interstitial pathogens causing pneumonia with an oxygen diffusion defect are respiratory viruses: influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, systemic acute respiratory distress syndrome and hanta pulmonary virus syndrome.8 PCP is found virtually only in individuals with HIV and immunosuppressed patients (ie, transplants), steroids (Table I).\n8, 22 In an \u201capparently normal\u201d host, the diagnosis of otherwise unexplained PCP should prompt HIV testing.8 Influenza A is the prototypical cause of severe viral CAP. Patients with severe influenza A have a severe oxygen diffusion defect and die of profound hypoxemia without bacterial suprainfections. A minority of patients with influenza have superimposed S. aureus CAP. Influenza with superimposed bacterial pneumonia is easily recognized in patients because there are focal infiltrates on chest x-ray. Later in viral influenza (ie, >48 hours), there may be bilateral patchy chest x-ray infiltrates which are not nonsegmental or lobar infiltrates, and indicate a superimposed bacterial pneumonia.8, 18\n",

Common differential diagnostic problems include differentiating viral influenza from adenoviral CAP.8, 18, 22, 23, 24 Ordinarily, CMV CAP in immunocompetent hosts is not a diagnostic consideration. In the case presented, a viral influenza was suspected because the case occurred during the peak of the influenza season. Adenoviral CAP also occurs during the late winter and early spring months and was also a likely diagnostic possibility. Because the patient did not have leukopenia, relative lymphopenia, or thrombocytopenia, CMV was considered as a possible pathogen only after influenza and adenoviral CAP were ruled out. Although it is true that influenza and adenovirus pneumonia may be associated with mildly increased serum transaminases, tests for these pathogens were negative, prompting testing for an unusual diagnosis (ie, CMV). The patient's IgM CMV titer was highly elevated (5.65 ISR; n < 1.1 ISR), which confirmed the diagnosis in this case (Table II).\n8, 18 We believe the mildly elevated influenza B titers were the result of CMV cross-reactivity.8, 25, 26\n",
