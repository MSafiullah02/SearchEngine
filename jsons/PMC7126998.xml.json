            "text": "The pathophysiology of diarrhea includes increased intestinal secretion and decreased intestinal absorption of fluids along with increased passage of intestinal contents. Severe dehydration caused by fecal loss of fluids and electrolytes is a frequent complication of diarrhea and the primary indication for oral and intravenous fluid therapy. A higher total body water content (approximately 75% body weight) and a higher extracellular fluid volume content (approximately 45% body weight) in newborn calves make them more sensitive to fluid losses compared with adult cattle. The higher proportional water content does not serve as a water reservoir and has no protective effect against dehydration.19 Fecal fluid loss in calves with severe watery diarrhea can reach 13% to 18% of body weight per day and is probably underestimated in most cases.20 The highest fecal fluid loss reported was in a calf that lost 21% of its body weight over 24 hours, although ad libitum oral fluids were provided.20 The kidneys compensate for increased fluid loss in diarrhea by decreasing urine production; however, if losses exceed fluid intake, dehydration follows.21\n",

            "text": "Blood electrolyte concentrations can vary considerably in calves with diarrhea because most calves generally have been treated with oral fluids before presentation.20, 24, 25, 26 Mixing errors of oral electrolyte solutions often occur, and many calves do not have access to fresh water.26 In dehydrated calves with diarrhea, decreased serum concentrations of glucose, sodium, potassium, and chloride have been reported.27 Hyponatremia is generally present as a result of increased fecal loss (secretory diarrhea);22, 27, 28, 29 however, hypernatremia also may be present. This is particularly true in calves that have been treated or overtreated with oral electrolyte solutions and do not have access to fresh water26 or calves to which an electrolyte solution with excessive sodium concentration was fed (> 140 mEq/L). Total body potassium concentrations decrease in diarrhea; however, hyperkalemia is often present in calves with diarrhea with severe acidosis.22, 27 Hyperkalemia is thought to result from translocation of potassium from the intracellular to the extracellular compartment.19 An impaired renal excretion of potassium also may play a role in this not-fully-understood mechanism of hyperkalemia involving hyponatremia, hypo-osmolality, acidemia, and cellular hypoxia.5 Calcium concentrations are often low, and magnesium concentrations vary in calves with diarrhea.22, 30 Electrolyte imbalances (sodium, total calcium, magnesium) have been found to be present even 10 days after completion of therapy in calves that were successfully treated for diarrhea.30\n",

In the authors' opinion, the indication for IV fluid therapy should be extended to some calves that may be less than 8% dehydrated. Regardless of the degree of clinical dehydration, when calves show signs of severe CNS depression or weakness, are comatose, are unable to stand, do not suckle for more than 24 hours, or have a rectal temperature of less than 100\u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) (in newborn calves), IV fluid therapy is indicated.

Our understanding of the pathophysiology of this acidosis has increased tremendously during the past decade, primarily because of discoveries by researchers in Europe and Canada on the significance of D-lactate in calves with gastrointestinal disorders. The importance of D-lactate in the pathophysiology of gastrointestinal diseases in calves has been elucidated in several clinical and experimental studies. Two thorough review articles were published recently on this subject;8, 11 however, a brief discussion is still warranted here. We have known for years that adult ruminants with acute rumen acidosis develop D-lactic acidosis after grain overfeeding.42 Only recently, however, were increased D-lactate concentrations identified to be responsible for most of the systemic acidemia that occurs in calves with the \u201cacidosis-without-dehydration syndrome\u201d12, 14 and for a major portion of the acidemia seen in calves with diarrhea.6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 43 In calves with ruminal acidosis after drinking or drenching of whole milk into the rumen, acidemia may follow after absorption of sufficient amounts of D-lactate from the gastrointestinal tract.15, 44\n",

This decrease in pH favors the overgrowth of bacteria (mainly Lactobacillus spp.) that are able to produce D- and L-lactate in high quantities.8 In calves with diarrhea, the increased production of D- and probably L-lactate is thought to result from villous atrophy, with subsequent malabsorption and fermentation of nutrients by intestinal bacteria.8, 11 Both the L- and D-isomers of lactic acid can be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract; however, the hepatic metabolism and renal excretion of D-lactate are significantly slower in ruminants compared with L-lactate. With increased production and absorption of L- and D-lactate, the metabolic acidosis that develops is primarily caused by increases in D-lactate concentrations.8\n",

Compared with the recent findings of elevated D-lactate concentrations in the blood, however, the small increases in L-lactate concentrations seen in earlier studies do not explain the high anion-gap (AG = ([Na+] + [K+]) - ([Cl-] + [HCO3\n-])) often found in calves with diarrhea.6, 13, 48, 52 An increase in the anion gap is the result of an increased concentration of strong anions in blood, mainly from organic acids (eg, lactic acid). Experimental induction of severe dehydration (at least 14% body weight) produced only a mild L-lactic acidosis.53 The discovery of D-lactate ended speculation of which unidentified anion or anions might be most responsible for the increase in the anion gap. It is clear that increased D-lactate concentrations explain most of the acidemia and elevated anion gaps present in calves with diarrhea and in clinically sick calves without diarrhea and dehydration (\u201cacidosis without dehydration syndrome\u201d).",

This finding was compared with healthy control calves that had D-lactate concentrations between 1 and 2 mmol/L.12, 14 The mean L-lactate concentrations seen in acidotic calves (1\u20132.5 mmol/L) were much lower than the reported D-lactate levels. Subsequent studies from Canada and Germany showed that hyper-D-lactatemia is often present in calves with more severe diarrhea and dehydration. A blood D-lactate concentration above 3 mmol/L was found in 55% of 300 calves with neonatal diarrhea.9 Median D-lactate concentration was 4.1 mmol/L and ranged from 0 to 17.8 mmol/L. The correlation between D-lactate concentration and base deficit was statistically significant but not linear, and the degree to which D-lactate contributed to metabolic acidosis varied from calf to calf (Fig. 1\n). Calves with a severe metabolic acidosis (base deficit > 25 mmol/L) always had increased D-lactate concentrations, whereas calves with a less severe acidosis (base deficit between 10 and 25 mmol/L) had D-lactate concentrations that varied from 0 to 17.8 mmol/L.9, 10\n",

Despite a markedly higher L-lactate concentration in rumen and fecal samples of diarrheic calves as compared with control calves, the L-lactate concentrations were not high enough to induce a systemic acidosis. The calves with diarrhea in that study had significantly higher values for D-lactate in all four samples (rumen, feces, blood, urine) than healthy control calves.7 The mean values for D-lactate were highest in the feces (25.4 mmol/L), followed by urine (19.2 mmol/L), rumen (17 mmol/L), and serum (13.9 mmol/L). The authors concluded that D-lactate production and absorption in the colon were more likely to have contributed to the systemic acidosis than other possible sites of absorption (rumen). Accumulated D-lactate may be effectively eliminated by the kidneys in nondehydrated calves.54 The role of IV fluid therapy to restore or maintain hydration status in sick calves is also important to speed elimination of D-lactate; however, kinetic studies of D-lactate elimination in calves are not currently available.",

Grain overload leads to production of short chain fatty acids and large amounts of D- and L-lactate.8 Because the ruminant liver is not efficient in metabolizing D-lactate, it begins to accumulate in the blood and systemic acidemia often follows. The same absorptive mechanisms for D-lactate in ruminating cattle may be responsible for systemic accumulation of D-lactate in preruminating calves with persistent ruminal acidosis from spilling milk into the rumen (ruminal drinking).15 Experimentally induced rumen acidosis in calves after repeated intraruminal force feeding of whole milk resulted in D-lactic acidosis. Calves developed hyper-D-lactatemia with concentrations between 6.8 and 11.1 mmol/L, generally in conjunction with metabolic acidosis, dehydration, severe depression, and lack of appetite or reduced suckle reflex.15 Calves that suffered from spontaneous diarrhea and concurrent ruminal acidosis (rumen pH < 6.0) had a higher mean D-lactate concentration (6.6 \u00b1 5.2 mmol/L) in blood as compared with calves with a normal rumen pH (5.3 \u00b1 5.4 mmol/L).9 The author stated that her study could not clarify whether the ruminal acidosis was a cause or a consequence of systemic D-lactic acidosis.",

D-lactic acidosis occurs after sufficient amounts of D-lactate have been absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (primarily colon) and neutralization of the accumulated D-lactate by buffer mechanisms in the body becomes inadequate. Reports of D-lactate concentrations in calves with diarrhea that are being fed milk-replacer diets with or without antimicrobials are unavailable, so it is unknown whether these calves develop D-lactic acidosis to the same degree as calves on whole milk diets.",

Subsequent studies confirmed that calves with diarrhea older than 1 week of age usually exhibit a higher base deficit.24, 25, 50, 66, 67 On the basis of his findings, Naylor68 developed a chart for predicting the severity of metabolic acidosis based on body position, strength of suckle reflex, and age of the calf, with corresponding values for base deficit and bicarbonate requirements for the treatment of metabolic acidosis in calves with diarrhea younger or older than 8 days. This protocol became a popular approach to guide diagnosis and treatment of acidosis in calves with diarrhea and is presented in common veterinary medical textbooks.

Calves that are unable to stand or have a weak or absent suckle reflex have a more severe acidosis and require intravenous sodium bicarbonate to correct their acidemia. D-lactic acidosis may be present in sick calves with or without diarrhea and dehydration that are recumbent or wobbly, tired, listless or comatose, and have a delayed, incomplete, or absent palpebral reflex. If the suckle reflex is absent or weak or the calf chews irregularly instead of suckling normally, D-lactic acidosis may be the underlying disease state. Clinical assessment for weakness and ability to stand is performed by careful manipulation to help calves stand up (not performed in comatose calves), for duration of anorexia by obtaining history and determining suckle reflex, and for hypothermia by palpation of extremities and recording rectal temperature.",

An estimated dehydration of more than 8% of the calf's body weight is the most widely accepted indication for IV fluid administration,73 although experimental evidence supporting this as the most appropriate intervention point is currently unavailable. One study demonstrated that calves dehydrated more than 8% required at least 24 hours to be adequately rehydrated with orally administered electrolyte solutions.74 Calves that are recumbent, severely depressed, or comatose and calves without a suckle reflex also need IV fluid therapy. Calves with rapidly progressing dehydration and consistent profuse watery diarrhea should be treated intravenously rather than rehydrated by ororuminal intubation. If treatment with oral fluids is not successful and only a weak suckle reflex is present, initial IV restoration of fluid and electrolyte deficits is preferred. Collapsed dehydrated calves in severe hypovolemic shock are not able to rapidly resorb sufficient amounts of oral or subcutaneously administered fluids and should receive IV rehydration.74 Resuscitation by IV fluid administration restores oxygen delivery and removes the metabolic products of poorly perfused tissues.60\n",

This goal was defined by Naylor and colleagues5 after D-lactate was identified as an important factor of metabolic acidosis that acts as a neurotoxic agent. The reduction of D-lactate helps to correct depression and restore the suckle reflex. Current research efforts concentrate on the development and evaluation of efficient strategies to decrease D-lactate concentrations.43, 54, 75 The administration of IV fluids may speed renal elimination of D-lactate and removal from body compartments such as the brain and CSF.54\n",

Whether IV fluid therapy alone is sufficient to reduce the D-lactate levels found in acidotic calves with diarrhea is questionable. Administration of oral electrolyte solutions with a high strong ion difference for at least 2 days may help hasten the renal excretion of D-lactate and avoid relapses. A Canadian study reported significant reductions of D-lactate concentrations within 24 hours after starting a treatment protocol with a combination of IV fluids, oral electrolytes, and antibiotics.75 This study examined the effects of orally administered Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, a probiotic bacteria that does not produce D-lactate. Unfortunately, the probiotic had no effect on D-lactate levels in serum and feces. The exact treatment plan was not presented in this study; however, combining IV buffer therapy and oral electrolytes with antibiotics seems logical for the treating D-lactic acidosis in calves with diarrhea and preventing relapses by controlling bacterial D-lactate production in the gastrointestinal tract with antimicrobials. A study from France suggested milk withdrawal for a short period combined with administration of antibiotics for the treatment of D-lactic acidosis in addition to administration of sodium bicarbonate.14 Further studies are desperately needed to evaluate the efficacy of various treatment protocols in calves with D-lactic acidosis.",

Hypertonic formulations of sodium bicarbonate are ideal for adding to larger quantities of isotonic saline to create a mildly hypertonic solution containing volume-expanding fluid and buffer.39, 66, 78 Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) is available in 100-mL or 250-mL glass bottles as 4.2% or 8.4% hypertonic formulations, which provides for easy calculation of the volumes for buffer requirements because 1 mL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate provides 1 mEq of buffer (HCO3\n-). One or two (250 mL) bottles of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate can easily be added to a 5 L bag of isotonic saline with a large syringe and mixed on the farm just before administration to avoid potential contamination.39, 66 In North America, 500-mL bottles of 5% sodium bicarbonate are widely available and contain 0.6 mEq of HCO3\n- per milliliter (298 mEq per bottle). Administration of undiluted 4.2% or 2.1% sodium bicarbonate has been recommended at a dosage of 500 mL to 1000 mL for resuscitation of comatose or severely acidotic calves before starting a volume-expanding or replacement solution.35\n",

Both substances produce an alkalinizing effect because they are metabolized predominantly to bicarbonate (HCO3\n-); however, they do not alkalinize as rapidly as sodium bicarbonate.80 Sodium-L-lactate showed a delayed effect in increasing blood pH when compared with sodium bicarbonate.64 A theoretic disadvantage of commercially available lactated Ringer's solution is that the lactate is a racemic equimolar mixture of L-lactate and D-lactate, and it should be avoided in severely acidemic calves with a blood pH of less than 7.2 because D-lactate concentrations already may be increased.11, 14, 80 Acetated Ringer's solution is theoretically superior to lactated Ringer's solution because acetate is metabolized faster and alkalinization is more rapid. Acetate would not exacerbate D- and L-lactic acidosis.64 A disadvantage of commercially available acetated Ringer's solutions is that it contains gluconate, which is slowly metabolized by neonatal calves.87 Despite these concerns, lactated Ringer's solution is popular and still widely used by practitioners. In general, acetated or lactated Ringer's solution is preferred to correct a less severe acidemia (pH > 7.20 or base deficit < 10 mEq/L), and sodium bicarbonate should be used for the treatment of severe acidemia in sick calves.",

Currently, isotonic sodium bicarbonate (1.3% = 13 g of NaHCO3/L = 155 mEq HCO3\n\u2212/L + 155 mEq Na+/L) at a dose of 1 to 4 L is the recommended solution for IV treatment of calves with diarrhea. Isotonic sodium bicarbonate rapidly corrects acidosis and dehydration and restores normal cellular function. When a calf's suckle reflex is re-established, further treatment can be given orally. Undiluted 8.4% hypertonic sodium bicarbonate solutions should be used with caution in severely dehydrated calves with diarrhea but are ideal for adding to larger quantities of isotonic saline. Correcting dehydration with rapid administration of small volumes of hypertonic saline solution (4\u20135 mL/kg body weight, 7.2% NaCl or 7.2% NaCl in 6% dextran-70) successfully resuscitates dehydrated calves but does not correct metabolic acidosis. Administration of hypertonic saline solutions should be accompanied by IV sodium bicarbonate in severely acidemic calves or by oral alkalinizing agents (acetate, propionate) in mildly to moderately acidemic calves.67 For additional information, a detailed review of solutions used for fluid and electrolyte therapy in ruminants was published in the November 2003 issue of Veterinary Clinics of North America: Food Animal Practice.80\n",

A straight and 2-cm long vein is suitable (see Fig. 3A).10.If the vein does not properly distend in severely dehydrated or hypothermic calves, apply a sponge or gauze soaked with warm water to increase blood flow to the ear.11.Prepare the catheter by gently moving the needle of the catheter back and forth to allow easy retraction of the needle after being inserted. Hold ear straight with one hand and bend the ear a little.12.Advance the tip of the catheter into the distended vein at least 0.5 in (1 cm) in one movement. Expect some head and/or ear shaking and be prepared to move with the calf.13.Confirm that the catheter is in the vein by watching for blood flow into the hub of the catheter before slightly withdrawing the needle (Fig. 3B).14.Advance the catheter completely into the vein and then remove the needle. Do not reinsert the needle into the catheter after withdrawing it because this may shear the catheter and potentially result in damage to the blood vessel.15.Fix catheter with first tape strip to the ear and press tape firmly (Fig. 4A).16.Remove tourniquet (rubber band) with razor or scissors.17.Check for correct catheter placement by examining for blood flow out of the catheter hub or by flushing the catheter.18.Hang the fluids, connect the fluid line (include an extension set if necessary), connect the fluid line, and open the fluids completely (again checking for correct catheter placement).19.Tape the catheter with a loop of the fluid line (extension set) to the ear with a second strip of tape (Fig. 4B). If necessary, place a gauze roll of adequate size inside the ear to allow better and more forceful taping. Do not tape in front of the catheter tip.20.Tape the fluid line to the base of the opposite ear with third strip of tape (Fig. 4C).21.Avoid stress and manipulation in severely compromised calves. Usually calves with severe dehydration and acidosis are depressed or comatose. These cases require almost no assistance from another person to place an ear catheter. If calves are more active, however, it is the authors' preference to use the least amount of restraint possible and attempt placement of the catheter without assistance. If necessary, light sedation can be used.\n\n",

Attaching the catheter to the pinna with cyanoacrylate (tissue glue),92 using a gauze roll placed inside the ear, and taping the catheter with bandage material have been recommended for better catheter fixation.91 The risk of damaging catheters in ear veins attached with two strips of tape is minimal if the calf is confined. If the calf is able to move its head in and out of a gate or a hole in the hutch, however, the ear catheter may dislodge or the fluid line may become disconnected from the catheter. To avoid this complication, calves can be tethered during IV fluid therapy. The fluid line is not easily accessible for chewing or biting if the fluid bag is hanging above the calf.",

Thrombosis is the most frequent complication and results in thrombophlebitis, periphlebitis, and systemic infection.95, 97, 98, 99 Severe thrombophlebitis of the jugular veins in cattle is characterized by a painful and warm swelling around the jugular vein, increased rectal temperature, reduced feed intake, and abnormal behavior.99 Auricular vein catheterization is believed to result in fewer complications compared with jugular vein catheterization.91, 95 Severe infections have not been observed by the author after using the ear vein catheterization technique in hundreds of calves. Arterial puncture is a common complication of jugular catheterization, resulting in the formation of large hematomas. Puncture of the artery is also a serious complication of ear vein catheterization, although it can be avoided by identifying this vessel. If an ear artery is catheterized accidentally, the brighter color of the blood or a slow infusion rate is usually obvious. An ear vein catheter can be left in place for several days without significant complications. In the authors' experience, calves with ear catheters left in place for up to 7 days had only minor swelling with no evidence of thrombophlebitis. Most catheters can be removed by the producer after 2 days if the calf is able to suckle and maintain a normal hydration status. Changing ear catheters is not needed as often as compared with jugular catheters.91 Although it tends to be a common criticism of ear vein catheters, slow fluid flow rates are almost never a problem; however, ear catheters do tend to occlude more than jugular catheters.91\n",

This mixture creates a slightly hypertonic solution and is recommended for use in calves younger than 1 week. All solutions are commercially available, and isotonic saline solution is supplied in plastic bags that are easily attachable in the calf's environment (see Fig. 4D). Calves that present with relapses after administration of this standard protocol receive another treatment when they are able to suckle. Calves that fail to significantly improve in attitude, have a weak or absent suckle reflex, or show consistent weakness after one or two administrations of the standard (5-L) IV fluid solution are generally suspected of having a more severe acidosis. These calves receive fluids that contain a higher amount of sodium bicarbonate, especially when they are older than 1 week of age. Up to 750 mL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate (750 mEq HCO3\n-) can be added to the 5-L bag of isotonic saline. Calves with ongoing relapses of dehydration or depression after repeated administrations of this standard IV protocol, with or without a higher dose of sodium bicarbonate, receive a transfusion of whole blood (800\u20131000 mL) through the same fluid line. All IV fluid therapy is performed by ear vein catheterization using a 22-gauge IV catheter placed under aseptic conditions. In calves with dehydration or severe depression, a maximum flow rate is preferred, which allows administration of 1 to 2 L/h. In normally hydrated calves, slower flow rates are used (0.5\u20130.75 L/h). Milk may be withheld for one feeding if D-lactic acidosis is suspected; however, milk feeding normally is continued.",

Twisting or kinking of the fluid line is frequently observed if the lines are in place for several days and if the calf begins to recover and starts moving around in the stall or hutch. It is difficult to perform long-term (maintenance) IV fluid therapy without fluid line problems in an unobserved calf. When the calf begins moving freely in its stall, the infusion line can be coiled and is often occluded after bending. Complications with maintaining a permanent fluid line can be reduced by using coiled infusion sets, self-retractable dog leashes, or elastic bands92 to which the infusion line is taped.

An infusion rate slower than 80 mL/kg/h is preferred to avoid overhydration and development of pulmonary, interstitial, or cerebral edema. Anemia and hypoproteinemia also may follow overhydration, leading to hypoxia if the packed cell volume falls below 15%. Formation of interstitial edema occurs if total protein concentrations drop below 4 mg/dL.95 To the authors' knowledge, these complications have not been reported in the literature of calves and may be overlooked because of lack of observation on the farm. It seems unlikely that severe overhydration of calves would occur with flow rates that can be accomplished through a small (22-gauge) ear vein catheter, however.",

Potential adverse effects of IV fluid administration on serum concentration of electrolytes, enzymatic activities, and voluntary intake of milk or oral electrolytes have not been investigated extensively. One study reported that the administration of isotonic sodium bicarbonate in calves with diarrhea was followed by a decrease in concentrations of potassium, magnesium, total calcium, and ionized calcium.22 The clinical significance of these findings is unknown, and the authors did not recommend any treatments other than the administration of sodium bicarbonate or calcium.22 In newborn calves with a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis (birth asphyxia), the administration of a hypertonic 5% sodium bicarbonate solution was followed by a decrease in total calcium concentration; however, concentrations of potassium, magnesium, and inorganic phosphorus were not affected 120 minutes after treatment.57 A study on the long-term effects of neonatal diarrhea and its treatment with IV sodium bicarbonate, glucose, and electrolyte solutions followed by oral electrolytes found significantly lower serum concentrations of sodium, magnesium, and total calcium up to 10 days after the last treatment was administered compared with healthy control calves.30 Base excess values of treated calves were significantly lower than those found in healthy control calves, and potassium concentrations were lower, although not statistically significant.",
