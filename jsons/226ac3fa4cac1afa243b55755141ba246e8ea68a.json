We therefore divided the 51 cases into three groups according to maternal clinical symptoms: the asymptomatic group (None, n = 27), onset to delivery within 1 week group (Within 1 w, n = 10) and onset to delivery over 1 week group (Over 1 w, n = 14).

Among the three groups, the CD19% and CD19 cell counts of the Within and Over 1 w groups were lower than those of the None group ( Figure 3a) ; the CD16-CD56% and CD16-CD56 cell counts in the Within and Over 1 w groups were slightly lower than those in the None group, but there was no statistical significance (p> 0.05) (Figure 4a ).",
