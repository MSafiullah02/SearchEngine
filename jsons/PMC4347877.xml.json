Clinical severity was characterized by composite scores (sum score) of symptoms in four categories: upper respiratory (earache, runny nose, sore throat and sneezing), lower respiratory (cough, breathing difficulty, hoarseness and chest pain), systemic illness (muscle ache, fatigue, headache and chills) and total severity (the above 12 symptoms).

We performed Kruskal\u2013Wallis tests to examine species-specific differences in individual symptom score and composite scores. We then compared symptoms with P value of Kruskal\u2013Wallis tests lower than 0.05 within each HRV species pair (e.g., HRV-A vs. HRV-B) using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and false discovery rate (FDR) to adjust for multiple comparisons. Last, we compared the pattern of serial HRV detection by performing Cochran\u2013Armitage Trend tests. Detection of HRV at consecutive visits implied ongoing viral shedding during that time period. A two-sided P value lower than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed using SAS software, Version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).",

In sharp contradistinction to influenza infection where children shed virus longer than adults [34], [35], [36], our data suggest that adults shed HRV longer than children. In addition, we observed adults to shed HRV-A longer than HRV-C. Longer shedding of HRV-A among adults may be correlated to more severe clinical presentation with such species. Further studies are needed to understand interaction of host response and viral virulence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to describe species-specific and age-specific differences in the patterns of viral shedding during natural HRV infection.",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. First, the small sample size, especially among children (n\n = 23), may have precluded us from identifying an association between HRV species and clinical outcomes. Second, the study population was comprised of individuals who presented to healthcare facilities with ILI. This may not reflect the epidemiology of HRV infection among individuals in the community who do not seek medical care. In addition, the majority of HRV cases in this study were from a single site. This may limit the generalizability of our results to different geographical regions. On the other hand, our study population also had a relatively small proportion of hospitalized patients and may not be fully representative of severe cases of HRV infection. Third, symptom diaries were not completed by all patients. It is possible that some participants suspended use of their diaries when their symptoms subsided. To address this, we performed a sensitivity analysis using data only from participants who completed the diary per protocol (n\n = 42). The analysis confirmed the results that adult patients with HRV-A had higher composite severity scores than those with HRV-B (data not shown). Finally, shedding of virus was measured by detection of RNA, not using cell culture. The fastidious nature of HRV has led to the use of PCR as the main tool for detection, so we feel this is acceptable, though it is only inferential of infectious particles. In addition, the duration of shedding was measured by consecutive detection of HRV in nasal swabs while genotyping was performed for only the baseline specimen. It is possible that the HRV detected at subsequent visits could have been new infections.",
