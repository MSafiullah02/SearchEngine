Viruses are connected to ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifiers in a variety of ways (\nFigure 1). Many viruses encode proteins that can modify the host's ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like machinery, often altering substrate specificity to favor replication. Viral proteins themselves can be directly modified by ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins, and some viruses even encode their own ubiquitinating or deubiquitinating enzymes. Host cells utilize the ubiquitin-proteasome system to counteract viral infections through the generation of target structures recognized by T cells, whereas viruses can alter proteasome degradation machinery to interfere with class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted antigen presentation and thus escape from T cell recognition. Viruses, in turn, depend on the ubiquitination and degradation of host surface receptors as countermeasures to escape from T cell recognition.",

            "text": "The ubiquitination pathway comprises E1, E2, and E3 enzymes, ultimately responsible for the conjugation of ubiquitin to protein substrates (for reviews see Pickart, 2001, Kerscher et al., 2006). The E3 ligase usually determines substrate specificity, although the E2-conjugating enzyme can also play a role in substrate selection. The best understood function of the ubiquitin-conjugating system is to tag proteins for degradation by the proteasome. A classic example of viral-induced degradation of host proteins is the ability of human papilloma virus (HPV) to degrade the transcription factor p53 (Scheffner et al., 1990). This occurs by means of the E6 viral protein that activates an E3 ligase, E6AP, which then specifically targets p53 for ubiquitination. It is now known that ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifiers have a far greater impact on viral lifestyles. Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifiers are involved in the innate and adaptive immune response (\nFigure 2), transcription, signal transduction, membrane trafficking, and more. Given the fact that viruses co-opt the biosynthetic and degradative apparatus of their host, extensive involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is to be expected in almost every aspect of their life cycle. It is therefore a challenge to distinguish between adventitious modification of viral proteins by host ubiquitination machinery without immediate consequences for virus lifestyle and those events that are required for virus replication and viral gene transcription. For the viruses that encode their own ubiquitin ligases or ubiquitin-specific proteases, it seems reasonable to infer functional relevance, but even in these cases, the identification of the exact role of such viral gene products remains a challenge. Nonetheless, the study of viral interactions with the ubiquitin system highlights the selective pressure to which these pathogens are exposed and the countermeasures required for them to ensure replicative success. Furthermore, these examples have helped clarify some of the inner workings of the ubiquitin-proteasome system itself and have brought to light other functions of ubiquitin, such as its role in the assembly of virus particles. In this review, we discuss several mechanisms viruses use to enhance their own replication, including modulation of the cell cycle by DNA viruses, interference with the innate and adaptive immune responses, and the requirement for ubiquitin in virion egress for many RNA viruses. We further discuss the many unknowns that remain, including the emerging and often undefined role of deubiquitinating enzymes, the uncertainties of ubiquitin-related modifiers ISG15 and SUMO, and the potential role of Urm-1 in viral replication.",

            "text": "Some viruses modulate the cell cycle to enhance their own replication (\nTable 1). These viruses are generally DNA tumor viruses such as HPV, adenovirus, and simian virus 40 (SV40) (reviewed in Levine, 2009). A common mechanism shared by these viruses entails targeting cell cycle regulator proteins for degradation, often resulting in transformation. The HPV-16 and -18 E6 proteins co-opt the cellular E3 ligase E6AP to mediate ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of p53 (reviewed in Beaudenon and Huibregtse, 2008, Mammas et al., 2008). Because p53 is a tumor suppressor protein, degradation of p53 by these HPV strains contributes to their oncogenicity by allowing uncontrolled cellular proliferation without inducing apoptosis. Other substrates besides p53 can be targeted for degradation via HPV E6, including MDM7 (murine double minute 7) protein, proteins containing a PDZ domain (a common structural motif found in signaling proteins), Bak (a protein involved in apoptosis), and E6TP1 (E6 targeted protein 1) (reviewed in Beaudenon and Huibregtse, 2008). For several substrates including the PDZ domain proteins and p53, HPV E6 can act as an E3 ligase in the absence of E6AP, but the mechanism is unknown. HPV infection also leads to degradation of the retinoblastoma protein pRb through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (reviewed in Mammas et al., 2008), mediated via the HPV E7-protein-induced generation of an E3 ligase complex consisting of the Cullin2 scaffolding protein, Elongins B and C, and the RING finger protein, Rbx1 (Huh et al., 2007). Like p53, pRb is a tumor suppressor and its inactivation contributes to transformation as well.",

            "text": "Although degradation of cell cycle proteins by co-opting cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes is the most common mechanism used by viruses to interfere with the cell cycle, some encode proteins that can inhibit cellular E3 ligases and prevent degradation of particular host proteins. HPV encodes the E5 protein, which inhibits the degradation of activated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (reviewed in Blanchette and Branton, 2009). E5 binds EGFR and interferes with receptor binding to c-Cbl (Zhang et al., 2005), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that downregulates activated phosphorylated receptor tyrosine kinases by ubiquitin-mediated degradation. The HPV E2 and adenovirus E4orf4 proteins can inhibit the cell cycle by interfering with the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), an E3 ligase required for progression through M phase (reviewed in Blanchette and Branton, 2009). Both viral E2 and E4orf4 ultimately inhibit the degradation of cyclin B and probably other substrates, leading to G2/M arrest (Bellanger et al., 2005). Viral E2 is itself controlled by an as yet unknown cellular ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates the viral protein (Bellanger et al., 2001). SV40 interferes with the cell cycle via its large T antigen, which binds to the SCFFbw7 ubiquitin ligase complex and inhibits degradation of cell cycle proteins such as cyclin E, probably by acting as a competitor (Welcker and Clurman, 2005). The large T antigen may also induce the ubiquitination of new substrates not normally targeted by the SCF complex.",

As depicted in Figure 2, viruses use a variety of methods to hijack the host ubiquitin-proteasome pathway to enhance their own replication and prevent detection by the immune system. Virus infection rapidly induces an antiviral state in the host cell, as exemplified by the induction of an interferon response. The nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) pathway is pivotal in activating both the innate and adaptive immune response. Furthermore, the NF-\u03baB transcription factor is itself regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (reviewed in Bhoj and Chen, 2009). A variety of stimulators, including virus infection, induces the activation of NF-\u03baB through the degradation of the I\u03baB proteins, which normally sequesters NF-\u03baB in the cytoplasm. Upon ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of I\u03baB, NF-\u03baB is released, enters the nucleus, and activates a variety of genes involved in setting up an antiviral state in the cell. Activation of NF-\u03baB can also be controlled by A20, a dual enzyme with both deubiquitinating and ubiquitin ligase activity, and will be discussed in more detail later. The role of ubiquitin in activation of the innate and adaptive immune response has been extensively reviewed (Bhoj and Chen, 2009).",

            "text": "Many different host factors that control the innate and adaptive immune response pathways are often targeted by viral gene products to counteract it (Figure 2). Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and most other lentiviruses encode several accessory proteins required for pathogenesis of the virus in vivo. One such accessory protein is viral infectivity factor (Vif), which acts as a substrate-recruiting subunit of a cellular E3 ligase complex (reviewed in Goila-Gaur and Strebel, 2008, Huthoff and Towers, 2008). Vif is required for viral replication in \u201cnonpermissive\u201d cells such as T cells and macrophages, but Vif is not required for replication in permissive cells such as epithelial cells. This is due to the action of a cellular cytidine deaminase, APOBEC3G, present in nonpermissive cells, which acts as an intrinsic immune response modulator. APOBEC3G is normally encapsidated into budding virions and induces cytidine to uracil mutations in the single-stranded DNA of HIV-1 during reverse transcription. This hypermutation leads to a block in viral replication (Lecossier et al., 2003, Mangeat et al., 2003, Mariani et al., 2003, Zhang et al., 2003). However, when Vif is present, it prevents encapsidation of APOBEC3G into viral particles by inducing its ubiquitin-dependent degradation (reviewed in Goila-Gaur and Strebel, 2008, Huthoff and Towers, 2008). Vif recruits Elongins B and C, Cullin5, and the Rbx1 E3 ligase (Yu et al., 2003). The entire complex then polyubiquinates APOBEC3G, leading to proteasome-mediated degradation (reviewed in Goila-Gaur and Strebel, 2008, Huthoff and Towers, 2008) and prevents its encapsidation into the retroviral virion (Figure 2).",

It is likely that CD4 downregulation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is required for proper trafficking and maturation of the viral glycoprotein, gp160, which would otherwise interact with CD4 and prevent its incorporation into the virion during egress. Vpu acts as an adaptor, interacting directly with CD4 in the ER and with the F box protein \u03b2TrCP, causing the transfer of ubiquitin via the Skp1-Cullin1 E3 ligase complex to CD4, which is then dislocated from the ER to the cytosol where it undergoes proteasomal-mediated degradation (reviewed in Nomaguchi et al., 2008). Vpu itself is not degraded during this process, but under certain circumstances Vpu can be ubiquitinated and degraded by an unknown E3 ligase complex (Estrabaud et al., 2007). The role of ubiquitin in controlling various aspects of receptor endocytosis has been reviewed extensively (see Miranda and Sorkin, 2007, Komada, 2008).",

            "text": "Similar to HIV-1 Vif, the rubulavirus V protein acts as an adaptor protein to alter the substrate specificity of a cellular E3 ligase (Ulane and Horvath, 2002). Rubulaviruses presumably seek to destroy STAT (signal transducer and activators of transcription) proteins by degradation as a mechanism to dampen the antiviral response. STAT-1 and -2 interact with IRF-9 (interferon regulatory factor-9), which is activated in response to interferon (IFN) binding to the IFN receptor. Viruses often activate the antiviral interferon response during infection, and thus degradation of STAT1/2 helps frustrate this response. Structurally, the mechanism for virus-induced degradation of the STAT proteins is very well understood. The rubulavirus V protein binds to the ultraviolet damage-specific DNA-binding protein-1 (DDB1). Structural analysis has determined that DDB1 contains a three-propeller cluster that allows the V protein to bind between two of these propellers while the third recruits the E3 ligase Cullin4A (Li et al., 2006). The Rbx1 RING protein is then recruited and binds to an as yet unknown E2 conjugating enzyme. Rubulavirus V proteins can then either directly target STAT2 for ubiquitination (human parainfluenza virus type 2) or STAT2 can be used to recruit STAT1 (simian virus 5 and mumps virus) (Precious et al., 2005). Regardless, the result is polyubiquitination of STAT1/2 and degradation by the proteasome. Mumps V protein, along with Rbx1, directly targets STAT3 for ubiquitination and degradation (Ulane et al., 2003).",

HCMV US11 and US2 proteins induce dislocation of MHC class I from the ER into the cytosol where the class I molecules become polyubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome (Wiertz et al., 1996a, Wiertz et al., 1996b). For US11, the Hrd1-Sel1L complex serves as the E3 ligase, a multisubunit complex that acquires its ubiquitin from a tail-anchored ER resident E2, Ubc6e.

Some early observations include the detection of free ubiquitin in retroviral particles, such as HIV, and the inhibition by proteasome inhibitors of the budding of retroviruses and other RNA viruses, presumably because the store of free ubiquitin to be used for conjugation is tied up (Martin-Serrano, 2007).",

The p6 domain is also known as the late budding domain (L-domain) and is thought to serve as an adaptor to recruit cellular proteins to mediate membrane fission, allowing release of the virion. Conserved motifs, such as PPXY or PTAP, are found in p6 and are thought to mediate its ability to recruit these proteins (Strack et al., 2000). The process of membrane fission that occurs during retroviral egress is similar to that of the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway (see Morita and Sundquist, 2004, Martin-Serrano, 2007, for reviews). During the formation of MVBs, the tumor susceptibility gene 101 (Tsg101) forms a multimolecular complex with ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) proteins and binds to monoubiquitinated cargo proteins. This complex then sorts the cargo into the MVBs (Katzmann et al., 2001). During retrovirus budding, Tsg101, along with other ESCRTs, is recruited to and binds directly to the PTAP motif in HIV Gag, instead of the usual monoubiquitinated cargo (Katzmann et al., 2001). Ubiquitination of retroviral Gag proteins enhances Tsg101 binding. Tsg101 is a noncanonical ubiquitin E2 variant (UEV) and lacks the catalytic cysteine residue necessary for ubiquitin conjugation (Babst et al., 2000). Binding of Tsg101 to the PTAP motif in Gag occurs through the UEV domain of Tsg101. Tsg101 is required for HIV budding: its depletion with RNA interference (RNAi) or overexpression of its UEV domain both inhibit virion release (Garrus et al., 2001, Demirov et al., 2002).",

Like HIV-1 Gag, it binds Tsg101 through the PTAP motif and this interaction is required for virion budding and release. Nedd4 binds to the PPXY motifs in retroviral Gag proteins, including RSV, M-PMV, and MMLV.

HPV E7, in addition to modifying the ubiquitination of host proteins such as pRb as discussed above, is itself modified by both an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a deubiquitinating enzyme. E7 is a short-lived protein degraded via the ubiquitin proteasomal pathway. The suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS1) protein is a member of the STAT signaling pathway and is induced upon exposure to IFN-\u03b3. SOCS1 causes ubiquitination and degradation of E7, thus increasing pRb levels (Kamio et al., 2004). E7 interacts with the SCF complex, which ubiquitinates E7 with the help of the E2 enzyme UbcH7 (Oh et al., 2004). The two pathways of E7 degradation are complementary: one occurs in the cytoplasm (SOCS1) and the other in the nucleus (SCF). The action of these ligases is opposed by the USP11 deubiquitinating enzyme: it interacts with E7, removes ubiquitin, and extends the half-life of E7 (Lin et al., 2008).",

ICP0 has two E3 ligase sites: a RING domain and a herpesvirus ubiquitin ligase-1 (HUL-1) domain. The RING domain recruits the cellular E2 enzyme UbcH5a as well as USP7, which is then ubiquitinated and degraded. ICP0 also undergoes self-ubiquitination, but its interaction with USP7 can lead to the stabilization of ICP0 by reversal of autoubiquitination. In the course of infection, the end result of these two opposing forces is the stabilization of ICP0 by USP7.",

It was first discovered that HSV-1 induces an antiviral response in the absence of viral replication, suggesting that expression of a viral protein normally counteracts this response. Cells infected with an ICP0 null mutant virus replicate much less efficiently and express higher levels of ISGs than do cells infected with wild-type virus (Harle et al., 2002). ICP0 inhibits IRF-3- and IRF-7-mediated activation of the ISGs (Lin et al., 2004). This inhibition requires the RING domain of ICP0 and the PML protein, but the exact mechanism is unknown. ICP0 also mediates the degradation of DNA-PK, which stabilizes IRF-3, further inhibiting the activation of ISGs, required for the induction of the IFN response. However, the ability of an ICP null virus to replicate is not enhanced by the inhibition of the STAT-1 or IRF-3 pathways, suggesting that some other mechanism, such as PML degradation, may be responsible for this phenotype (Everett et al., 2008).",

The IE proteins of EBV (BZLF1) and human herpes virus 6B (HHV-6B, IE-1) are also sumoylated. The IE proteins of herpesviruses are essential in initiating viral gene expression upon virus entry. They often act as transcriptional regulatory factors that help jump-start downstream early viral gene expression during viral infection (HCMV IE2), but IE proteins also regulate the cell cycle and apoptosis and can disrupt the PML nuclear bodies (HCMV IE1 and EBV BZLF1). There is currently no phenotype associated with a sumoylation-resistant HCMV IE1 protein (Lee et al., 2004). HCMV IE2 interacts with pRb, p53, as well as several cellular transcriptional activators. IE2 interacts with SUMO-1, SUMO-3, and Ubc9. Although a sumoylation-resistant IE2 shows no differences in subcellular localization or stability, it does not transactivate early viral promoters as well as wild-type IE2 (Hofmann et al., 2000). SUMO may thus alter the ability of IE2 to interact directly with those viral promoters or transcription factors required for efficient viral gene expression. The exact role of SUMO modification of the IE proteins in HCMV infection remains to be clarified. Sumoylation of the HHV6 IE1 protein may increase its stability, but whether its sumoylation affects transcriptional activity is not known. Similar to the other herpesviral IE proteins, the EBV BZLF1 (Z) protein is a transcriptional activator and can disrupt the PML nuclear bodies. The role of sumoylation in the viral life cycle is unclear, because a sumoylation-deficient Z protein likewise disrupts nuclear bodies; however, sumoylation of Z does appear to decrease the ability of Z to transactivate certain promoters (Adamson, 2005). These examples once again illustrate the challenges in distinguishing between adventitious and purposeful ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifications by viruses.",

Adenovirus E1B55K, together with E4orf6 and cellular proteins, ubiquitinates and promotes proteasomal degradation of p53 as discussed earlier. E1B55K contains a consensus site for sumoylation responsible for its nuclear localization (Endter et al., 2001). Indeed, a K104R sumoylation-resistant mutant shows altered localization and a reduced ability to interact with p53 and to transform cells (Endter et al., 2001). Both the HPV and bovine papilloma virus (BPV) E1 proteins interact with Ubc9 (Yasugi and Howley, 1996) and BPV E1 can be sumoylated. An HPV E1 mutant unable to bind to Ubc9 fails to support viral replication (Yasugi and Howley, 1996) and demonstrates the importance of sumoylation for small DNA tumor viruses.",

Upon viral infection, interferon is induced, leading to the induction of ISGs including ISG15, one of the most highly induced IGSs (reviewed in Sadler and Williams, 2008). ISG15 can be secreted from cells that produce it by an as yet unknown mechanism and therefore may act as a cytokine to modulate the immune response (D'Cunha et al., 1996). ISG15 has specific E1 (UBE1L), E2 (UBCH6 and UBCH8), and E3 (HERC5 and TRIM25) ligases. ISGylation is reversible via the action of ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs), including USP18 (UBP43), USP2, USP4, USP13, and USP14 (reviewed in Sadler and Williams, 2008). However, unlike ubiquitination, ISGylation is not known to promote degradation, but instead acts as an antiviral effector. A complicating factor is the possibility of alternative modification of a given substrate protein either with ubiquitin or with ISG15, or modification with both ubiquitin and ISG15. Recombinant Sindbis viruses that drive the expression of a variety of ISGs was used to infect IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor\u2212/\u2212 (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2R\u2212/\u2212) mice to identify attenuators of infection (Lenschow et al., 2005). Expression of ISG15 had an antiviral effect, protecting against Sindbis virus-induced death, and decreased viral replication. However, the antiviral state in the course of VSV and lymphocytic choriomeningitits virus (LCMV) infection in ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice was similar to wild-type controls (Osiak et al., 2005).",

Influenza B virus strongly induces expression of ISG15, but the NS1 protein binds ISG15, inhibits activity of the UBE1L ligase, and prevents ISGylation (Yuan and Krug, 2001). Surprisingly, influenza A NS1 protein lacks this activity, but in this case, viral infection fails to induce expression of ISG15 (Yuan and Krug, 2001). Ovarian tumor (OTU)-domain proteases from nairoviruses of the Bunyaviridae family (Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus [CCHFV], large [L] protein) and arteriviruses (equine arteritis virus [EAV], nonstructural protein 2 [nsp2]) are deISGylases as well as deubiquitinases (Frias-Staheli et al., 2007). These OTU domain proteases are present in eukaryotes, bacteria, and viruses. The viral OTU domain proteases show much broader target specificity, unlike their host counterparts. Expression of these proteases reverses the antiviral effect of ISG15, increasing the host's susceptibility to Sindbis infection (Frias-Staheli et al., 2007). The viral OTU domain proteases inhibit NF-\u03baB-dependent signaling, likely through their deubiquitinating activity. Expression of the OTU domains of CCHFV-L and EAV-nsp2 inhibits the translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB to the nucleus (Frias-Staheli et al., 2007). Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) expresses a distinct protease, PLpro, which mediates deISGylation. Although ISG15 is its preferred substrate, PLpro is also capable of deubiquitination (Lindner et al., 2007).",

Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection or IFN treatment increases the conjugation of ISG15 to cellular proteins, including IRF-3 (Lu et al., 2006).

The ubiquitination of HIV-1 Gag and Tsg101 and Nedd4 are necessary for virion budding and release from the cell surface as discussed earlier. Type I IFN inhibits the assembly and release of HIV-1 virions. This occurs through the IFN-induced expression of ISG15, which inhibits the ubiquitination of Gag and Tsg101, preventing the interaction of the Gag L domain with Tsg101 (Okumura et al., 2006). However, ISG15 is not itself conjugated to Gag or Tsg101. Ubiquitination of Gag by the Nedd4 ubiquitin ligase is necessary for the release of virions. Overexpression of ISG15 effectively decreases the ability of Nedd4 to ubiquitinate the viral matrix proteins (VP40), thereby decreasing release of Ebola virus-like particles (VLPs) from cells (Okumura et al., 2008).",

            "text": "The role of ubiquitin-like modifiers is no longer confined to the modification of proteins and lipids. A recent series of papers describes an unexpected role for ubiquitin-related molecule-1 (Urm-1) in transfer RNA (tRNA) modification (Schlieker et al., 2008, Leidel et al., 2009, Noma et al., 2009). Though only distantly related to ubiquitin, Urm-1 has the typical \u03b2-grasp fold that characterizes members of the ubiquitin family (Singh et al., 2005) and also possesses the typical diglycine motif at the C terminus of the mature polypeptide, common to ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifiers. The occurrence of proteins covalently modified by Urm-1 (\u201curmylation\u201d) has been reported (Furukawa et al., 2000), but thus far appears to be limited to a single protein of known identity, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (Ahp1), in yeast (Goehring et al., 2003). Whether urmylation of proteins is a widespread modification, and if so, under which conditions (stress, growth conditions, and virus infection) remain open questions. Urm-1 serves as a sulfur carrier essential for thiolation of certain tRNAs [(UUU) Lys; (UUC) Glu; and (UUG) Gln], which carry a thiolated uridine residue in the wobble position of the anticodon (Schlieker et al., 2008, Leidel et al., 2009, Noma et al., 2009). Urm-1 can be isolated from mammalian cells as a C-terminal thiocarboxylate that is the immediate precursor for a sulfur transfer reaction involving a persulfidic intermediate (Schlieker et al., 2008). In the absence of Urm-1, yeast cells can no longer carry out the requisite thiolation reaction and become sensitive to a variety of stresses (Pedrioli et al., 2008). The mechanistic link between a failure to execute thiolation and the increased sensitivity to stress observed in Urm-deficient cells is not yet understood. For example, it is not clear how tRNAs that fail to undergo thiolation affect translational efficiency, fidelity, or the half-lives of the tRNAs themselves. A number of plant viruses, including brome mosaic virus, possess tRNA-like structures at the 3\u2032 end of their genomes. These structures are suffciently similar to tRNAs to serve as substrates for aminoacyl tRNA synthetases and other enzymes that act on tRNAs (Dreher, 2009). The mouse gammaherpesvirus MHV-68 encodes at least eight tRNA-like sequences that can be processed into mature uncharged tRNAs, the function of which in the context of the virus life cycle is obscure. Clearly, viruses have co-opted tRNAs and tRNA-like structures to initiate replication, as is well established for retroviruses (reviewed in Abbink and Berkhout, 2008), presumably for reasons that increase fitness, but we still lack an adequate mechanistic explanation. Given the relationship between Urm-1 and specific tRNA modifications, it is perhaps reasonable to suggest that aspects of translational control and fidelity, as well as virus replication itself, may be modified in a manner that involves Urm-1, although for the moment this remains pure speculation.",

EBNA1 of EBV is required for multiple aspects of viral replication: maintenance of the viral genome, transcription and translation of the viral DNA, viral persistence, and transformation of cells. The exact role of HSV-1 ICP0 interaction with USP7 is not known, but as noted earlier, ICP0 is an E3 ligase that ubiquitinates USP7, causing both to be degraded. ICP0 is also a substrate for USP7 and is stabilized by interaction with this DUB. In the course of infection, the net result of these two opposing forces is the stabilization of ICP0 by USP7.",

Furthermore, its disregulation has been implicated in cancer development (reviewed in Reya and Clevers, 2005).

Deubiquitinating activity in herpesviruses was first discovered with activity-based HA-ubiquitin probes (HAUbVME) in HSV-1-infected cell lysates (Kattenhorn et al., 2005). The N-terminal fragment of UL36, the large tegument protein, is the source of this activity. UL36 homologs from \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-herpesviruses all contain a putative cysteine box with a histidine box further downstream. UL36 lacks obvious similarity to any known DUB, and the crystal structure of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) M48 DUB domain has determined that the herpesviral DUBs represents a new family of deubiquitinating enzymes (Schlieker et al., 2007). DUB activity has been confirmed for several other herpesviruses including EBV, MCMV, and HCMV (Schlieker et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2006). Mutation of the putative active site cysteine in UL48 of HCMV produced lower virus yields but the activity is not essential for replication of HCMV in tissue culture (Wang et al., 2006). Further work with Marek's disease virus (MDV), an \u03b1-herpesvirus, has demonstrated a potential role for the herpesvirus DUB in pathogenesis in vivo. Mutation of the MDV DUB active site cysteine caused a stark reduction in the formation of T cell lymphomas in chickens (Jarosinski et al., 2007). Similar mutants were made for pseudorabies virus (PRV): mice infected with a DUB active site mutant virus survived twice as long and demonstrated a decrease in neuroinvasion compared to those infected with wild-type virus (Bottcher et al., 2008). The PRV DUB active site mutant demonstrates a defect in virion assembly and egress in vitro (Bottcher et al., 2008). The large tegument protein remains tightly bound to the nucleocapsid during transit to the nucleus, and could thus be important for entry of the virus, as well as for viron assembly and egress. As a key component of the virion, the tegument-encoded DUB might participate in either or both of these events. More recently, two other active DUBs (BSLF1 and BXLF1) were discovered to be encoded by EBV via computer modeling to search for the conserved C- and H-boxes of the known DUB families (Sompallae et al., 2008). Homologs of these proteins exist in some of the other herpesviruses; therefore, it is likely that more functional DUBs will be discovered in these viruses.",

Whether the SARS-CoV PLpro functions as a DUB in the course of infection is not known, though it is probable. It might serve to protect the viral replication complex from ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome.",

Upon activation in the nucleus, the adenain protease cleaves six viral capsid precursor proteins inside the viral capsids (Ruzindana-Umunyana et al., 2002). In the cytoplasm, adenain is thought to cleave cytoskeletal proteins, aiding in cell lysis and release of the virions. Adenain also contains deubiquitinating activity (Balakirev et al., 2002). During adenoviral infection, the levels of adenain correlate with a corresponding decrease in ubiquitinated proteins, particularly in the nucleus. The identity of the affected substrates is not known, a challenge common to most enzymes in this class, and the role of the adenain-associated DUB activity in the viral life cycle remains to be clarified.",

Not only is modification of ubiquitinated substrates during the course of viral infection a mainstream event, but examples of viruses that encode their own ubiquitin ligases as well as deubiquitinating enzymes are increasing rapidly. A continuing challenge that remains is the discovery of the substrates for these newly described viral enzymes. Enzyme-substrate interactions may demonstrate high affinity but may also be transient. The relatively recent advances in mutagenesis techniques that allow rapid production of virus mutants, also for the large DNA viruses, coupled with the ability to manipulate host protein expression, will help determine the function and substrates of these emerging viral and cellular ubiquitin modifiers.",

The Ub/Ubl is then ligated to a substrate via the action of an E3 ubiquitin ligase (3). The E3 determines substrate specificity and can be either cellular or viral in origin. The ubiquitinated substrate is then released (4) and can be polyubiquitinated, often leading to proteasome-mediated degradation (5), or the Ub/Ubl can be removed via the action of a cellular or viral deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) (6). Alternatively, in the course of viral infection, a viral protein can bind to a cellular ubiquitin ligase complex, altering substrate specificity (7). The substrate is released after ubiquitin conjugation (8).",
