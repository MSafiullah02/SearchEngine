It is thought that, similar to other RNA viruses, high mutation rates allow NoVs to evolve fast and to undergo rapid immune escape at the population level. However, the rate and spectrum of spontaneous mutations of human NoVs have not been quantified previously. Here, we analyzed the intra-patient diversity of the NoV capsid by carrying out RT-PCR and ultra-deep sequencing with 100,000-fold coverage of 16 stool samples from symptomatic patients. This revealed the presence of low-frequency sequences carrying large numbers of U-to-C or A-to-G base transitions, suggesting a role for hyper-mutation in NoV diversity. To more directly test for hyper-mutation, we performed transfection assays in which the production of mutations was restricted to a single cell infection cycle. This confirmed the presence of sequences with multiple U-to-C/A-to-G transitions, and suggested that hyper-mutation contributed a large fraction of the total NoV spontaneous mutation rate. The type of changes produced and their sequence context are compatible with ADAR-mediated editing of the viral RNA.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Noroviruses (NoVs) are one of the most common causes of foodborne viral gastroenteritis, infecting over 250 million people worldwide every year.

NoVs are positive-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the family Caliciviridae and, similar to other RNA viruses, they exhibit extremely high levels of genetic diversity (Debbink et al., 2012) . NoVs have evolved into seven highly divergent genogroups (GI-GVII), which are in turn divided into genotypes. The prototypic Norwalk virus belongs to genotype GI.1, but GII.4 has become the most prevalent genotype in the last decades, being responsible for the majority of outbreaks (White, 2014) . The most variable NoV genome regions are located in the surface-exposed P2 domain of the capsid (VP1) protein, which determines antibody escape (Lindesmith et al., 2008; White, 2014) . Differences in genetic diversity and evolution rates among NoV genotypes have been attributed to multiple factors, including random genetic drift, receptor usage, the structural plasticity of the VP1 protein, and replication fidelity (Bull and White, 2011; Donaldson et al., 2010) .

Unexpectedly, we found a small number of hyper-mutated sequences carrying large numbers of A-to-G or U-to-C base transitions that were not attributable to sequencing errors. In this sense, since the per-base error rate of the employed technology is ca. 1/1000 (J\u00fcnemann et al., 2013) , it is extremely improbable to find multiple mutations in a single read. The natural genetic diversity of NoVs has been studied previously within individual patients (Nilsson et al., 2003; Obara et al., 2008; Vega et al., 2014) , within defined outbreaks (Dingle, 2004; Holzknecht et al., 2015; Sasaki et al., 2006) , or at larger geographic and temporal scales (Bodhidatta et al., 2015; Carlsson et al., 2009; Cotten et al., 2014; Kobayashi et al., 2015; Vega et al., 2014) . However, this diversity depends on multiple factors other than spontaneous mutation rates, including natural selection, the number of replication rounds elapsed and random genetic drift, among others. To discard these confounders and focus on spontaneous mutations, we used a cell culture system in which human cells are transfected with an infectious cDNA clone (Asanaka et al., 2005; Katayama et al., 2014) . Since these cells do not support viral attachment and entry, this system restricts viral replication to a single infection cycle. Whereas this is generally viewed as a limitation, single-cycle viral replication was convenient for the purpose of mutation rate estimation, because it allowed us to minimize the effects of selection and other evolutionary factors. This approach allowed us to observe hundreds of sequences carrying multiple U-to-C or A-to-G substitutions each, suggesting that a large fraction of all spontaneous mutations corresponds to hyper-mutation events.

To objectively define hyper-mutated sequences, we analyzed the distribution of the number of U-to-C transitions among the 100,000 reads obtained for each replicate assay. The distribution clearly deviated from a Poisson model of rare random events, showing an excess of sequences with high mutation counts (Fig. 3A) . Based on this, we defined hyper-mutated sequences as those carrying five or more mutations in the 266-base region studied. However, the data also showed that hyper-mutation was not an all-or-nothing process and that the number of mutations per read varied continuously. Regarding U-to-C substitutions, we found 1444 hyper-mutated reads (266, 481 and 697 reads for assays 1, 2 and 3, respectively), meaning that approximately one in every 200 reads (0.48%) contained U-to-C hyper-mutations (Table 2) . These carried 11,612 total U-to-C substitutions, the number of mutations per read varying from 5 to 31 out of the 88 U residues contained in the 266-base fragment.

A major determinant of the frequency of U-to-C mutation was the identity of the 3\u2032 neighboring base. Among the 11,612 U-to-C changes observed, the 3\u2032 neighbor was U in 5228 cases, A in 5053 cases, G in 1098 cases, and C in only 233 cases.

We argue that, depending on whether the hyper-mutation takes place in the minus or plus strand, U-to-C or A-to-G changes are observed, respectively, in the (plus strand) genomic RNA. A likely mechanism underlying these Ato-G mutations is ADAR, which edits adenosines to inosines that subsequently base-pair with cytosines (Samuel, 2011; Valente and Nishikura, 2005) . A hallmark of ADAR 1 and 2 is that editing is more likely when the 5\u2032 neighbor of the editable base is A or U and, more precisely, the neighbor base preferences have been shown to be U N A N C NG (Dawson et al., 2004; Kuttan and Bass, 2012; Lehmann and Bass, 2000; Polson and Bass, 1994) . Our sequence analysis shows these same preferences, thus supporting the involvement of ADAR in NoV hyper-mutation. Previous work has shown or suggested ADARmediated hyper-mutation in several viruses, but these were negativestrand viruses as opposed to NoVs (Samuel, 2011) . Hyper-mutation should be carried out by the interferon-inducible p150 isoform of ADAR1, since this is the only ADAR form located in the cytoplasm (George et al., 2011) where NoVs replicate. ADAR uses doublestranded RNA as a substrate and, therefore, the template RNA has to adopt a nearly perfect stem-like secondary structure or be a doublestranded replicative intermediate. The secondary structure of the NoV genomic RNA has not been solved experimentally and, although in silico RNA folding shows limited reliability for long molecules, stem-like structures are simple enough to be confidently predicted. However, the minimum free energy structure of the 266-base region encompassing VP1 nucleotides 38 to 303 predicted by the mfold algorithm (Zuker, 2003) did not show a stem-like structure. This suggests that ADAR acts on NoV double-stranded replicative intermediates. ADAR 1 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues (Kim et al., 1994) and, although HEK293 cells express relatively low ADAR 1 levels, this activity was shown to be sufficient to edit 5% of hepatitis delta virus RNA molecules (Sato et al., 2001) . In B lymphocytes, which are candidate cell targets for NoVs in vivo (Jones et al., 2014) , ADAR1 and ADAR2 are more strongly expressed and have been shown to edit thousands of adenosines in cellular mRNA and long non-coding RNA .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 500, "end": 514, "text": "(Samuel, 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 515, "end": 543, "text": "Valente and Nishikura, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 742, "end": 763, "text": "(Dawson et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 764, "end": 786, "text": "Kuttan and Bass, 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 787, "end": 810, "text": "Lehmann and Bass, 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 811, "end": 833, "text": "Polson and Bass, 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1093, "end": 1107, "text": "(Samuel, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1256, "end": 1277, "text": "(George et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1856, "end": 1869, "text": "(Zuker, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2035, "end": 2053, "text": "(Kim et al., 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2210, "end": 2229, "text": "(Sato et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2300, "end": 2320, "text": "(Jones et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "A limitation of our study is that, whereas transfection assays were carried out using a cDNA clone belonging to genogroup I, viruses isolated from stool samples were all from genogroup II. However, the type of mutations produced and the neighbor base preferences were very similar in stool samples and in transfection assays. Specifically, 82.9% of the 5\u2032 neighbors of U-to-C mutations and 72.3% of the 3\u2032 neighbors of A-to-G mutations were A or U in clinical samples. After correcting for base composition, the resulting 3\u2032 neighbor preferences for U-to-C mutations were A NU NG NC, whereas the 5\u2032 preferences for A-to-G mutations were UNAN GN C in clinical samples. The similarities between the results obtained in transfection assays and in vivo support a common underlying mechanism, despite the fact that different genogroups were used for these experiments. Still, hyper-mutation was 30-fold more abundant in the transfection assays than in clinical samples. We attribute this difference to the fact that selection was mild or absent in transfection assays, whereas in stool samples (which should contain mainly free virions) we expect stronger selection against hyper-mutated genomes. Alternatively, it is possible that ADAR activity was lower in the NoV target cells in vivo than in HEK293 cells. However, B cells show extensive ADARmediated editing of cellular RNAs . Work with HIV-1 has shown that the observed levels of hyper-mutation vary depending on whether intra-cellular or virion-associated sequences are analyzed (Russell et al., 2009) . APOBEC massively edits the retroviral cDNA, leading to a rate of G-to-A mutation of approximately 4 \u00d7 10 \u22123 per base per cell, a value two orders of magnitude higher than HIV-1 reverse transcriptase errors (Cuevas et al., 2015) . In contrast, the rate observed in plasma is 44 times lower, consistent with the notion that the vast majority of APOBEC-edited HIV-1 genomes is unviable and rapidly removed by selection (Ho et al., 2013) . In human hepatitis B virus, papilloma virus, herpes simplex virus 1 and Epstein-Barr virus The strong deviation between observed and expected counts shows that sequence reads carrying multiple mutations were more frequent than expected from the Poisson model. Based on this, hyper-mutated reads were defined as those carrying five or more mutations. B. Reproducibility of U-to-C mutation frequency in three transfection assays.

A variant of this strategy has been devised for ADAR-edited sequences, which allowed detecting hyper-mutants in Rift Valley virus (Susp\u00e8ne et al., 2008) .
