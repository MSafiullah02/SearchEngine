COVID\u201019 is the third known zoonotic coronavirus disease after SARS and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV also belong to the \u03b2\u2010coronavirus cluster.\n3\n Zhu et al\n4\n confirmed that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was a new \u03b2\u2010coronavirus belonging to the subgenus botulinum of Coronaviridae. According to the current data,\n5\n the early COVID\u201019 cases were related to the Huanan seafood market, and the possibility of human\u2010to\u2010human transmissions could not be ruled out. The WHO report claimed that the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 could be detected in the environmental samples collected from the seafood market, but it has not yet been determined if a specific animal species carries the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. A study by Ji et al\n6\n showed that the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was a chimeric virus between a bat coronavirus and a coronavirus of unknown origin. By comparing with other animals, they found that snakes are the most likely wildlife repository for the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\n6\n The research by Benvenuto et al\n7\n showed that the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was only closely related to the coronavirus isolated from Chinese chrysanthemum\u2010headed bats in 2015. Their research supported the theory that the transmission chain started from bats to humans.",

The authors also found that the ratio of male to female deaths was 3.25:1, the median age of death was 75 years, the median time from the first symptom to death was 14 days, and the median time from early symptoms to death in people aged 70 or older (11.5 days) was shorter than that in people under 70 years old (20 days).

Men had a higher ACE2 level in their alveolar cells than women. Asians have a higher level of ACE2 expression in their alveolar cells than the White and African American populations. The binding of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 on ACE2 causes an elevated expression of ACE2, which can lead to damages on alveolar cells. Damages to alveolar cells can, in turn, trigger a series of systemic reactions and even death. They also confirmed that Asian males are more susceptible to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. Wrapp et al\n16\n found that the receptor\u2010binding ability of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is 10 to 20 times stronger than that of SARS\u2010CoV.",
