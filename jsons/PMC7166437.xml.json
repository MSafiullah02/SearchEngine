In nursing home A, nursing and public health staff monitored residents for fever or respiratory symptoms, whereas in nursing home B surveillance for infection was performed by an infection control nurse. Residents with fever or respiratory symptoms had nasopharyngeal swabs taken for viral antigen detection and culture, urine for Legionella antigen detection, and acute and convalescent serology for viruses, mycoplasma, and legionella. An attempt was made to obtain sputum and blood cultures. Chest X\u2010rays were performed, when clinically indicated, at the discretion of the attending physician. Environmental investigations included obtaining water samples from shower heads, faucets, and air conditioning units for detection of Legionella.\n14 Distances from residents' beds to the room air conditioning unit and bathroom, as well as from the residents' rooms to the tub room and showers on the floor, were measured. The surrounding area was surveyed for the presence of cooling towers and other potential aerosol producing sources. To control the outbreak in nursing home A, the water was hyperchlorinated and superheated to 65\u00b0C at the farthest tap. Shower heads and faucets were disinfected with bleach.\n14\n In nursing home B, the water system was hyperchlorinated and the hot water tank and air conditioners descaled\n15\n after cultures were obtained. Water cultures were repeated after the institution of control measures in both homes. Once the diagnosis of legionellosis was made in each facility, all symptomatic residents were treated with oral erythromycin.",

Although legionellosis is traditionally associated with two distinct illnesses (Legionnaires' disease and Pontiac fever), a wide spectrum of illness ranging from mild cough to pneumonia was observed at both nursing homes. Therefore, for the case\u2010control study, a case definition was developed that could account for the spectrum of illness observed. Cases of Legionella infection were defined as residents present in the nursing home at the time of the outbreak who met any one of the following criteria: (1) a fourfold rise in Legionella serum antibodies to a titer \u22651:128; (2) a positive urine Legionella antigen test; (3) at least one respiratory symptom or sign and a single serologic convalescent titre \u22651:256; (4) three or more symptoms or signs of lower respiratory tract infection; or (5) two or more symptoms or signs and an infiltrate on chest X\u2010ray. Respiratory symptoms and signs included in the definition were new or increased cough, new or increased sputum production, fever \u226538\u00b0C, pleuritic chest pain, new chest findings on examination, new or increased shortness of breath, or respiratory rate >25 per minute. Controls were defined as residents who were asymptomatic during the outbreak and included those who had negative urine tests for Legionella antigen. A case\u2010control study was performed by comparing cases to controls in both nursing homes. In nursing home A, all residents in the facility were assessed for symptoms and had urine samples tested for Legionella antigen. All asymptomatic residents with negative urinary antigen were included as controls. In nursing home B, two controls were selected randomly for each case and matched for both age and sex. Potential exposures were identified through chart review, interviews with nursing staff, and environmental measurements. Data collected included possible risk factors for legionellosis, dietary factors, swallowing ability, and resident location.",

Although Legionella species are widely distributed in the environment, and outbreaks of legionellosis have been well described,\n3\n, \n4\n, \n5\n, \n6\n, \n7\n, \n8\n, \n20\n only one previous outbreak in a nursing home has been reported.\n9\n Although it is possible that the outbreaks in these two nursing homes represent very unusual events, we believe that it is more likely that Legionella infection in nursing homes is frequently unrecognized: the discovery of a Legionella outbreak in nursing home A led investigators at nursing home B to consider the diagnosis of legionellosis. One of the reasons why legionellosis in nursing homes may be unrecognized is that its clinical features are nonspecific. Respiratory tract illness indistinguishable from that caused by a virus was the most common clinical presentation of L. sainthelensi infection in these two outbreaks. The clinical features of our cases resembled those reported previously for patients with infection caused by L. sainthelensi,\n12\n, \n13\n with illnesses ranging from persistent cough, to acute bronchitis, to pneumonia. The incidence of documented pneumonia (14%) in these two outbreaks was less than that in the single previously reported nursing home outbreak of legionellosis, in which nearly a third of symptomatic individuals had pneumonia.\n9\n However, neither the respiratory illness that predominated in our outbreaks nor Legionella pneumonia have clinical features that permit the distinction of etiology. This investigation shows that legionellosis should be considered in outbreaks of undiagnosed respiratory infection in nursing homes.",

Measurements of distances to potential sources of aerosolization were not significant in the multivariable analysis.

That surrogate markers for aspiration were significant in both the univariate analysis (stroke, having fluids or semifluids mixed with medication, a pureed diet) and the multivariable analysis (pureed diet) provides supporting evidence for aspiration as the mode of transmission of infection in these outbreaks.

The lack of clinical isolates of Legionella is not unexpected since sputum can rarely be obtained from nursing home residents,\n22\n, \n23\n and the inability to detect Legionella in the water supply of nursing home B may have been attributable to limited sampling before hyperchlorination. It is possible that a few of the cases with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection, but without laboratory evidence of legionellosis, may have been infected with other unidentified pathogens. However virologic and serologic investigations did not detect other infectious agents in these residents. Combining data from both nursing homes in the analysis may have led to bias as a result of confounding by nursing home location. However, the risk of confounding was minimized by stratifying the univariate analysis by nursing home site and by keeping site in the final multivariable model.",
