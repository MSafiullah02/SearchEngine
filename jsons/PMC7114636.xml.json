            "text": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a component of the primary host defense in the mucosa. AMPs are produced mainly by epithelial cells and the cells involved in innate immunity. The functions of AMPs in defense against various infections are better characterized than their role as innate immune modulators (Boyton and Openshaw, 2002). Defensins are small cationic AMPs and are found in various organisms including mammals, insects, and plants. Among them, \u03b2-defensins are primarily produced by epithelial cells and leukocytes in vertebrates (Stolzenberg et al., 1997). Immature dendritic cells (DCs) can be activated by \u03b2-defensins, and \u03b2-defensins also inhibit infection by Haemophilus in\ufb02uenzae and viruses (Zhao et al., 2016; Lafferty et al., 2017). Inactivation of human \u03b2-defensins (HBDs) leads to the recurrent airway infections experienced by patients with cystic fibrosis (Smith et al., 1996). Also, a lack of human \u03b2-defensin 2 (HBD 2) results in immune dysfunction, such as reduced numbers of B and regulatory T cells, resulting in decreased production of antigen (Ag)-specific immunoglobulin A (Lugering et al., 2005; McDonald et al., 2007). Therefore, an understanding of the regulatory mechanism by which AMPs modulate the immune response during the early stage of viral infection is critically needed to deal with various diseases caused by virus infection.",

            "text": "Virus infection of host cells triggers innate antiviral responses, which are initiated via pattern recognition receptor (PRR) signaling pathways (Ishii et al., 2008). Among the PRR families, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (Nod2) is an important mediator of the innate immune response to viral infection, and induces expression of type I interferons (IFNs) to promote the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and restrict viral replication (Wiese et al., 2017). Furthermore, Nod2-deficient mice exhibit decreased production of IFNs and increased susceptibility to viral infection (Sabbah et al., 2009). Presumably, the ability of a virus to counteract innate antiviral immunity during the early stage of infection influences pathogenicity and disease severity (Perlman and Dandekar, 2005). Type I IFNs play a major role in the antiviral innate immune response by upregulating the production of antiviral proteins and the recruitment of immune cells (Haller et al., 2006). Production of type I IFN is initiated by ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic viral sensors in response to detection of viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as double-stranded RNA (Kato et al., 2011; Li and Zhong, 2018). Stimulated viral sensors activate downstream signaling pathways, leading to expression of transcription factors including IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), which drive IFN-\u03b2 expression (Yoneyama et al., 2004). However, some viruses, including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), inhibit these type I IFN induction pathways (Zielecki et al., 2013). For example, various proteins of MERS-CoV, including M protein, papain-like protease protein (PLpro), and accessory proteins 4a and 4b, are antagonists of IFNs (Shokri et al., 2019). Accordingly, the virulence of MERS-CoV is linked to its immune evasion mechanisms, such as suppression of IFN production during the early stage of infection, induction of macrophage apoptosis, and inactivation of T cells with downregulation of Ag presentation (Niemeyer et al., 2013).",

Macrophages are present in the respiratory mucosa, such as in the lung and various fluid compartments, where the detection of and the response to infection occur. Due to their location, macrophages detect viral Ags first and promote an antiviral innate immune response as well as an Ag-specific adaptive immune response by presenting Ags to T-cells (Manicassamy et al., 2010). We previously reported that HBD 2 promotes an antiviral innate immune response in macrophage-like THP-1 cells and elicits an enhanced Ag-specific and virus-neutralizing antibody (Ab) response in vivo using the receptor binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV spike protein (S RBD) as a model Ag (Kim et al., 2018). Moreover, the type I IFN response and the production of primary antiviral molecules such as Nod2 were enhanced by S RBD-HDB 2 treatment of THP-1 cells (Kim et al., 2018). Consequently, we assumed that modulation of Nod2 signaling by HBD 2 would prevent infection by viruses that suppress innate antiviral immunity. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which HBD 2 enhances the type I IFN immune response in THP-1 cells by modulating Nod2 signaling pathways using HBD 2-conjugated S RBD of MERS-CoV.",

S RBD-HBD 2 significantly (p < 0.01) enhanced the expression of IFN-\u03b2 and Nod2 by 2.18- and 7.35-fold, respectively, compared to S RBD alone-treated THP-1 cells (Fig. 2A and B). The expression of TNF-\u03b1, an NF-\u03baB-dependent proinflammatory cytokine, was increased in S RBD-HBD 2-treated cells compared with that in S RBD alone-treated cells, albeit not significantly so (Fig. 2C). We next assessed the levels of the Nod2-associated signal transducing mediators, receptor interacting protein-2 (RIP2) and IRF3, in S RBD- or S RBD-HBD 2-treated THP-1 cells (Fig. 3\n). As expected, treatment with S RBD-HBD 2 remarkably upregulated the phosphorylation of RIP2 and IRF3 and the Nod2 protein level. In addition, HBD 2-conjugated S RBD reduced I\u03baB\u03b1 accumulation, degradation of which requires NF-\u03baB activation (Fig. 3C). Therefore, HBD 2-conjugated Ag treatment induces the production of the type I IFN, IFN-\u03b2, and the proinflammatory cytokine, TNF-\u03b1, through Nod2-associated RIP2 response by activating the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-\u03baB.",

CCR2 and S RBD-HBD 2 co-localized, suggesting a direct interaction, but no such co-localization with CCR2 was observed for S RBD alone (data not shown). We next evaluated whether the interaction of HBD 2 with CCR2 mediates intracellular signaling. Interestingly, the significantly (p <0.01) enhanced IFN-\u03b2 expression by S RBD-HBD 2 was abrogated by the CCR2 antagonist, RS 102,895 (Fig. 4B).

In our previous report, a proinflammatory cytokine response, which requires the activation of NF-\u03baB, was induced by HBD 2 (Kim et al., 2018). Additionally, early stimulation of an innate immune response is dependent on Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and/or Nod2-triggered NF-\u03baB signaling (Tsai et al., 2011). We thus determined whether the HBD 2-mediated enhancement is due to Nod2-associated signaling because Nod2 expression was enhanced by S RBD-HBD 2 (Fig. 5\n). S RBD-HBD 2 co-localized with Nod2, suggesting an interaction (Fig. 5A), but no such co-localization with Nod2 occurred for S RBD without HBD 2 conjugation (data not shown). Consequently, we speculated that Nod2 interacts with S RBD-HBD 2 and that Nod2-mediated signaling is involved in HBD 2-mediated activation of NF-\u03baB. We evaluated the influence of Nod2 signaling on HBD 2-mediated type I IFN and proinflammatory responses using the inhibitor of Nod2 signaling, GSK 717. GSK 717 abrogated the HBD 2-mediated (p < 0.01) enhanced expression of IFN-\u03b2, RIP2, and IRF3 (Fig. 5B\u2013D). Additionally, a Nod2 inhibitor abrogated the enhanced expression of TNF-\u03b1 in HBD 2-treated THP-1 cells (Fig. 5E). These observations suggest that Nod2 functions as an intracellular signal transmediator in HBD 2-induced activation of type I IFN production and the inflammatory response.",

Innate immune cells, such as macrophages and mast cells, recruited into infected sites produce a wide range of cytokines that regulate the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses and so maintain immunological homeostasis (Gallenga et al., 2019). Cytokines have pleiotropic effects on the functions of immune cells and immune responses that constitute the host defense against infectious agents. For instance, members of the IL-1 family, which are produced by macrophages and mast cells, are important regulators of the innate immune response and play a role in inflammatory processes (Varvara et al., 2018). Several IL-1 family cytokines are pro-inflammatory, while others, including IL-37, IL-38, IL-1Ra, and IL-36Ra, are anti-inflammatory (Kritas et al., 2018). In addition, IL-1 indirectly participates in T-lymphocyte-mediated immunity by inducing helper type 2 T-cell polarization and the formation of Abs by plasma cells by producing IL-6 (Gallenga et al., 2019). These findings suggest that further studies on modulation of the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and network among innate immune cells, such as M1/M2 macrophage polarization, would facilitate the development of novel therapeutic approaches for immunological disorders.",

Viral infection activates danger signals which are transmitted via PRRs, including TLRs, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene 1-like receptors (RLRs), C-type lectin receptors, cytosolic DNA sensors, and inflammasome signaling cascades. Cross-talk between PRRs and activation of these signaling cascades induces an antiviral immune response by upregulating the expression of antiviral cytokines, including type I IFNs. However, viruses can evade the antiviral function of IFN by inhibiting IFN production and signal transduction (Ferran and Skuse, 2017). Type I IFNs, mainly IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, are major effector cytokines in the innate antiviral response (Gonz\u00e1lez-Navajas et al., 2012) and their encoding genes are regulated by several transcription factors, including NF-\u03baB and IRF3 (Seth et al., 2005). Upon virus infection, IRF3 is phosphorylated, dimerizes, and enters the nucleus to upregulate the expression of type I IFN, melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), and cytoplasmic retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), leading to activation of NF-\u03baB and IRF3 (Kato et al., 2011).",

Although inflammation is a double-edged response, it is an important mechanism of protective innate immunity against infection by viruses, bacteria, fungi, prions, and parasites. Inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages and innate immune cells are rapidly recruited to inflamed sites, where they remove harmful stimuli and induce T-cell responses by IFN-dependent mechanisms (Ginhoux et al., 2016). We previously reported that HBD 2 promotes the antiviral innate immune response in THP-1 cells and the ability of an HBD 2-conjugated MERS-CoV Ag to elicit a greater Ag-specific and MERS-CoV neutralizing Ab response compared to HBD 2 non-conjugated Ag in vivo (Kim et al., 2018). Also, immunization with S RBD-HBD 2 prior to viral infection enhanced the humoral and protective immune response to MERS-CoV infection in human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4)-expressing mice, a model of MERS-CoV infection (data not shown). In addition, the type I IFN response, the expression of primary antiviral molecules including Nod2, a cytoplasmic viral PRR that activates IRF3, and production of IFN-\u03b2 were enhanced by HBD 2 treatment of THP-1 cells. These cells are widely used as an in vitro model for studies of human macrophages involved in the inflammatory response and immunological homeostasis (Ginhoux et al., 2016). Here, we investigated the immunomodulatory ability of HBD 2 and the mechanism by which HBD 2 induces production of type I IFN and an inflammatory response in THP-1 cells.",

For example, mouse \u03b2-defensin 2 activates immature DCs via TLR4, triggering a Th1 response, and human \u03b2-defensin 3 activates APCs via TLR1 and TLR2 in an NF-\u03baB-dependent manner (Funderburg et al., 2007). Additionally, it was suggested that \u03b2-defensin is an endogenous ligand for TLR4 and shares a signal transduction pathway with other TLR4 ligands. We evaluated the possible interaction between HBD 2 and TLR4 as well as Nod2 and found that HBD 2-conjugated Ag co-localized with Nod2 (Fig. 5A) but not with TLR4 (data not shown). Moreover, inhibition of Nod2 signaling in THP-1 cells abrogated the HBD 2-mediated enhanced IFN-\u03b2 expression by suppressing RIP2 and IRF3 signaling as well as TNF-\u03b1 expression (Fig. 5B\u2013E). Human and mouse \u03b2-defensins induce CCR2- and CCR6-dependent chemotaxis (R\u00f6hrl et al., 2010b) and CCR2 and CCR6 recruit professional APCs to inflamed tissues and initiate an adaptive immune response (Osterholzer et al., 2005). CCR2 is expressed on various types of myeloid cells, including monocytes and neutrophils, which are crucial for innate immunity and phagocytosis (Iida et al., 2005). We found that HBD 2-conjugated Ag co-localized with CCR2 and contributed to Nod2-mediated signaling, leading to the activation of type I IFN production and an inflammatory response in THP-1 cells. Consequently, the mechanism underlying HBD 2-induced CCR2-mediated signaling should be investigated further.",

During infection with influenza A, the phagocytic capacity of mouse peritoneal exudate macrophages is enhanced by co-culture with virus-infected epithelial cells (Fujimoto et al., 2000), and decreased phagocytic uptake of opsonized influenza A virus is correlated with decreased cell surface expression of CD16 and CD32, which are highly expressed by classically activated M1 macrophages. Also, expression of CD16 and CD32 is decreased in macrophages infected with viruses capable of replicating productively in them (Marvin et al., 2017). M1 macrophages exert a proinflammatory effect, present Ag, perform phagocytosis, produce TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, and express CD80 and CD86 on their surface. By contrast, M2 macrophages are responsible for tissue repair and wound healing, produce IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2, and express arginase-1 and CD163 (Gordon and Martinez, 2010). We report here that HBD 2 induces the expression of M1 markers by activating CCR2-mediated Nod2 signaling pathway in THP-1 cells (Fig. 6).

Expression levels relative to those of the PBS-treated control are shown as means \u00b1 SD. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, and ***p<0.001.",
