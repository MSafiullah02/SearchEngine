In the epidemic season 2016/2017, according to the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) vaccination in children over 6 months of age and older was recommended, as well as in children with increased risk of complications caused by influenza. It also is important to vaccinate people who are in contact with children under 5 years of age. It is recommended to vaccinate pregnant women (2 and 3 trimesters), which makes newborn babies less vulnerable to contract the infection (Jackowska 2016). Unfortunately, the percentage of vaccinated children in Poland is still dramatically low. In 2016, 0.60% of children aged 0\u20134 years and 0.94% children aged 5\u201314 years were vaccinated (Epimeld 2017).",

The most precise and efficient method of confirming influenza virus in a test sample consists of molecular biology, be it reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or real-time quantitative transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) (Cie\u015blak et al. 2017). However, the method is as yet hardly available in tertiary hospitals. Instead, rapid antigen diagnostic tests are often used (Nitsch-Osuch et al. 2017). Their use requires less time, which is an important factor in diagnosis (Chartrand et al. 2012). Rapid methods of influenza diagnosis significantly reduce the overuse of antibiotics in children (Nitsch-Osuch et al. 2016). The neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir are the only causal treatment of children infected by influenza virus. Administration of zanamivir is possible only in in-hospital setting, as the drug is given by inhalation (Jackowska 2016).",
