It actively distanced the WHO under Director\u2010General Brundtland from the earlier \u2018Health for All\u2019 strategy: a global strategy approved by the World Health Assembly of the WHO (WHA, 1981). The Director General's introduction to the 2000 report stated that work in the area of health systems should be \u2018consistent\u2019 with values of \u2018Health for All\u2019, but that \u2018recommendations should be based on evidence rather than ideology\u2019 (WHO, 2000: vii). Reflecting this ambition, the report was modelled somewhat on the style of the World Development Reports, with a cross\u2010country statistical appendix comparing health system performance across countries. The evidence and indicators used however, particularly those measuring \u2018fairness\u2019, and their underlying assumptions, came under sharp professional criticism (Almeida et al., 2001; Ollila and Koivusalo, 2002; Wagstaff, 2002).",

Now the policy reports were signalling a renewed emphasis on international and intra\u2010country inequalities. In 2006, reports by UN/DESA, the World Bank and UNDP each to some extent addressed this theme (UN/DESA, 2005; UNDP, 2005; World Bank, 2006). The World Health Organization had changed course earlier, in 2003, and as we would expect, this shift was signalled in the World Health Report 2003. That report led with the scale of health inequity in the world; reaffirmed in the \u2018Message from the Director General\u2019 the commitment to \u2018Health for All\u2019 as an \u2018organizing principle\u2019 for health; and put renewed emphasis on primary health care and integrated health systems (WHO, 2003). In the WHO the broader focus on inequalities took form in the context of the launch of the Commission on the Social Determinants of Health in 2004, whose first interim report was published in 2007 (CSDH, 2007).",

In some ways the theme can be considered as a safe choice, on a turf where global co\u2010operation is essential, where global health security needs to be taken seriously, and where shared international concerns exist. The projection of this as safe turf for the organization is reflected in the emphasis on a shared \u2018safer future\u2019 and on the need for compliance with international health regulations. It picks up on fears amongst the rich countries about vulnerability to epidemics that begin elsewhere, and is consistent with the increasing emphasis on biosecurity, especially in richer countries.",

The demands of global health security have become divisive in the context of pandemics, and in the work of the Intergovernmental Working Group on virus sharing, as \u2018our\u2019 global future is in danger of becoming \u2018ours and theirs\u2019. The politics of this divide is driven by a widespread feeling that rich countries require poor countries to comply in order to ensure biosecurity in rich countries, and that rich countries have less interest in the capacities, and the states of health and vulnerability, in poorer countries. This divide can also be seen to arise from the engagement of those predominantly concerned with security as against those concerned with health. The task of bridging this divide and engendering trust is sharply articulated in the 2007 report. Among the turbulent 2007 realities, the report's task of showing how \u2018collective international public health action can build a safer future for humanity\u2019 (p. ix) also requires it to steer between two quite different political terrains. On the one hand, the poorest human beings on the planet are at the greatest risk, and policy needs to address their needs. On the other hand, policy may easily be diverted to a focus on rewarding those who can profit from the presence of threats, such as the pharmaceutical industry's R&D, military surveillance, and investors in production capacity for vaccines and medication in the event of pandemics.",

They formed the historical context through which the international agenda was shaped, starting from plague quarantine, cholera and smallpox. Hence, historically the international health regulations were defined by a few particular diseases in relation to which action was mandatory. In contrast, the latest set of international health regulations covers a broader array of diseases and stages of concern, and also expands the concept of public health emergency to include industrially\u2010generated catastrophes, such as chemical and radiation emergencies and environmental emergencies. The new regulations thus broaden the concept of public health security, in politically important ways, beyond control of diseases. The report defines global public health security as \u2018the activities required, both proactive and reactive, to minimize vulnerability to acute public health events that endanger the collective health of populations living across geographical regions and international boundaries\u2019 (WHR 2007, p. ix). This definition remains conveniently broad and vague enough to include a wide array of measures and actions. However, the focus of the report is not so much on how global health security is defined but rather on examples it can be seen to entail.",

            "text": "This approach, in quite a short report, is illustrated in the second section, which explores the range of threats to global security: it is of interest both for its content and its silences. Consider for example the links which it implicitly draws with the organization of health systems. The report identifies human causes of public health insecurity, putting some emphasis on drastic long\u2010term failure to undertake adequate investment in public health and surveillance, resulting from a false sense of security about public health. In addition to natural catastrophes, the report identifies policy changes affecting preventive measures, the public health consequences of conflict, large\u2010scale industrial catastrophe and microbial evolution and antibiotic resistance as major threats. Thus the role of poverty, inequalities, war, fragmentation of social structure and public service structures emerge strongly from these pages, yet there is rather little explicit addressing of the implications of these issues. For example, the discussion of antimicrobial resistance says: \u2018If the use of anti\u2010infective drugs were better rationalised, the evolutionary pressure on bacteria would be altered and susceptible strains could again proliferate.\u2019 (p. 23). The implication that health systems need strengthening is noted, but there is no exploration of the context in which people buy medicines in poorly regulated markets.",

More radically, the report makes the following point: \u2018Had SARS been allowed to establish a foothold in resource poor settings, it is doubtful whether the demanding measures, facilities and technologies needed to interrupt chains of transmission could have been fully deployed\u2019 (p. 40). At the global level, this observation implies that our global health security requires us to take seriously lives and public health realities in resource\u2010poor contexts: that the weakest link to public health security in rich countries lies in the living conditions and health systems of developing countries. Inequality is thus key to insecurity. There are no shortcuts, and in comparison to the more traditional hygiene\u2010 and surveillance\u2010oriented public health approach, we need to address not merely the strengthening of primary health care, but also the capacities of hospitals.",

This is one of the report's key arguments: that many of the public health emergencies described in it could have been prevented or better controlled if the health systems concerned had been stronger and better prepared. We can use a case study from India to reinforce this point. An impressive account of the Indian plague epidemic by Ghanshyam Shah identifies the importance of the organization of our health systems and the basis on which these operate for the emergence and path of epidemics. In Surat, a large proportion of the private sector doctors fled quickly from the epidemic, amongst the first of the fleeing population. They left behind them the public sector hospitals and doctors, so often criticized and blamed for corruption, to hold the fort and treat those who were ill. Shah shows how the professional medical culture had become profit\u2010oriented in Surat, so that during the plague epidemic as many as 76 per cent of general practitioners in the plague stricken areas were reported to have fled (Shah, 1997). Thus, in the context of the expanding market for health services, we do need to ask, on what basis do medical professionals work and whom do we expect to bear the brunt of the health security measures? How far do public obligations extend? In what contexts do they become important, and who are the professionals who will respond to emergencies? To what extent are corporate hospitals willing to take responsibility for treatment of health security threats? Could they see these duties as demands to be off\u2010loaded onto remaining public sector organizations? If not, what would ensure this?",

This event represented a severe loss of trust in the operation and working methods of the Global Influenza Surveillance Network. The main controversy was about the necessity of sharing viruses; but in the context of the consequent World Health Assembly resolution, it evolved to focus on equitable use of virus samples (Fidler, 2008; WHA, 2007). The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) has reported substantial numbers of patents for H5N1 virus\u2010related work and while one cannot patent viruses (WIPO, 2006), it is possible to patent vaccines and products developed from them or on the basis of information derived from virus samples. The crisis was generated because the WHO distributed virus samples to corporate research laboratories, generating the demand for confirmation that those donating the viruses would be able to afford vaccines produced (see, for example, Fidler, 2008). The international health regulations on virus\u2010sharing were in danger of becoming compromised just as they were finally entering into force in June 2007.",

The report documents the current lack of vaccine production capacity. The current maximum annual production capacity for trivalent influenza vaccines is 500 million doses. Meanwhile, the dependence on corporate production capacity for vaccines and emergency preparedness is costly, given industry requirements for committed purchase of influenza vaccines in order to maintain vaccine production capacity for pandemic conditions. Ensuring that the poorest populations do not lose out in a global pandemic will require international mechanisms to redistribute resources to the most vulnerable.",

The shortness may be explained by the election process and timing of the arrival of the new WHO Director\u2010General, Dr Chan, because of the previous DG, Dr Lee's untimely death.
