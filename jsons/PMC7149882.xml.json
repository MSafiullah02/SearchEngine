The mean age of death of MS patients is 58 years old, compared to the general national average in the USA of 72 years old (Minden et al., 1993). Within the USA, MS is observed more often in Caucasians compared to African-Americans (Minden et al., 1993). However, the typical clinical course is more severe within African-Americans who are affected (Pugliatti et al., 2002). In regard to geographical patterns, a higher incidence of MS occurs when moving either more north or south of the equator, especially in countries with colder climates (Pugliatti et al., 2002). This latitude effect is also present within the USA as the incidence of MS is highest within the upper Midwest and Northeast compared to the South (Minden et al., 1993).",

The risk for developing MS within dizygotic twins is the same as for other siblings (3\u20135 per cent). However, the risk for monozygotic twins is greater than 30 per cent (O'Connor et al., 2002; Willer et al., 2003). A greater than 10-fold increased risk of developing MS exists within individuals having certain human leukocyte antigens (HLA) genotypes (O'Connor et al., 2002; Sadovnick, 2002; Herrera and Ebers, 2003; Kenealy et al., 2003). The major predisposing associated haplotype is HLA-DR2 in cellular typing nomenclature (DR15,DQ6 by serology and DRB5*0101-DQA1*0102-DQB1*0602 by sequence-based terminology) (Haegert and Francis, 1993; Hillert, 1994). Even though an association between HLA class II DRB1*15 and DRB1*17 alleles and MS has been seen in individuals of northern European and Mediterranean descent, the presence of these haplotypes does not preclude the development of MS (Sadovnick, 2002; Herrera and Ebers, 2003; Kenealy et al., 2003). Genetic interactions may also occur between certain haplotypes and certain T cell receptors, immunoglobulins and tumor necrosis factors which may lead to an increased chance of developing MS (O'Connor et al., 2002; Alizadeh et al., 2003).",

Immunocytochemical studies of active MS lesions have shown damage to vascular walls with intramural deposition of complement on smooth muscle components as well as protein-rich leakage (Noseworthy et al., 2000). These abnormalities can occur within hours to days of an acute attack and slowly resolve over subsequent weeks to months (Poser, 1986).",

A number of organisms or their nucleic acids have been observed within the CSF or brain parenchyma of patients with MS (Booss and Kim, 1990; O'Connor et al., 2002). These organisms include mycoplasma (Cevassut, 1930), protozoa (Bequignon, 1956), spirochetes (Ichelson, 1957), as well as a number of both DNA and RNA viruses, such as herpes simplex viruses types 1, 2 and 6 (Sanders et al., 1996), rabies virus (Bychkova, 1964), parainfluenza virus type I (ter Meulen et al., 1972), coronavirus (Talbot et al., 1996), canine distemper virus (Rohowsky-Kochan et al., 1995), measles virus (Haase et al., 1981), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (Berger et al., 1989) and human T lymphotrophic virus type I (HTLV-I) (Salmi et al., 1983; Greenberg et al., 1989). However, none of the above organisms have been successfully isolated from large groups of clinically definite MS patients. Furthermore, within MS patients infected with these organisms, levels did not correlate with disease activity (O'Connor et al., 2002).",

One hypothesis for the mechanism in which viruses cause MS has been proposed which involves both direct and indirect pathways (Clausen, 2003). Viruses could directly damage and lead to functional alterations within oligodendrocytes, resulting in demyelination. Because a single oligodendrocyte can send processes to many neighboring axons, impairment can cause demyelination within a large volume of brain tissue (Silberberg, 1986). Viral invasion may also directly damage endothelial cells within blood vessels and lead to a disruption of the blood\u2013brain barrier. This may subsequently allow for indirect mechanisms in which immunocompetent or activated T lymphocytes can gain entry into the CNS. Demyelination could develop due to the release of cytokines from these activated cells (Poser, 1986; Noseworthy et al., 2000).",

Myelin may not be the primary focus of attack but instead may be an \u2018innocent bystander\u2019 with the large-scale destruction that occurs resulting from the interaction of the immune system and reactivated viral infection (Silberberg, 1986; Clausen, 2003).",

A variable degree of visual loss within the central vision can be observed (Leibowitz and Alter, 1968; Kuroiwa and Shibasaki, 1973). Often the patient with ON will complain of a loss of color vision (red desaturation). Physical examination can reveal a relative afferent pupillary defect. Most often the lesion in ON is retrobulbar with the fundoscopic examination normal during the acute stages (Nordmann et al., 1987). Later, as the disease progresses, the optic disc can become pale as a result of axonal loss and resultant gliosis with temporal pallor present. Typically acute ON will get worse over a time period of several days to 2 weeks, with subsequent visual recovery slowly occurring over 2-4 weeks (Beck et al., 1994). Improvement from ON can continue to progress for up to 1 year after the initial onset of visual symptoms (Beck et al., 1993c).",

The degree of depression can range from mild to severe (Patti et al., 2003; Lisak, 2004) and typically develops after other clinical manifestations. This progression suggests that depression may result within individuals from a greater understanding and knowledge of their disease process rather than due to a direct reaction to the illness. Depression may be quite difficult to identify in some patients, as symptoms can overlap with other disease features, including fatigue, diminished attention and concentration and pain (Kinkel and Rudick, 2002).",

            "text": "Examination of CSF can also assists in the diagnosis of MS (McDonald et al., 2001). Typically glucose and protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are normal in MS. A few mononuclear cells per cubic millimeter may also be observed. Often a significant elevation of the CSF immunoglobulin level relative to other protein components is present. This immunoglobulin increase is predominantly IgG with an excess primarily in lambda and kappa light chains (Whitaker et al., 1990; Fukazawa et al., 1993). The IgG level may be expressed as a percentage of total protein (normal < 11 per cent), as a percentage of albumin (normal < 27 per cent) or by the use of the IgG index (normal value < 0.66) (Whitaker et al., 1990). CSF IgG production abnormalities, as measured by the IgG index, are found in more than 75 per cent of clinically definite MS patients (Miller et al., 1983; Zeman et al., 1993, 1996; Lowenthal and Karcher, 1994). An elevation in oligoclonal bands can also be observed and is seen in more than 80 per cent of patients with clinically definite MS (Zeman et al., 1993, 1996). More recently, the presence of serum anti-myelin basic protein (MBP) antibodies can predict progression to MS after a clinically isolated event. MBP is one of the major components of myelin and is normally negligible in the CSF During an acute MS flare it rises and falls quickly (Warren and Catz, 2003).",

The INCOMIN study (independent comparison of interferons) compared interferon-beta-1b (Betaseron) with intramuscular interferon-beta-1a (Avonex) in 188 patients with relapsing-remitting MS and found the former to be more effective on both clinical and MRI outcomes.

In a subsequent study, the Controlled High-Risk Avonex MS Prevention Study (CHAMPS), patients newly diagnosed with MS (those who suffered a first acute clinical demyelinating event and who also had evidence of prior subclinical demyelination on brain MRI) were treated with either Avonex or placebo after initial treatment with corticosteroid therapy.

No laboratory monitoring is necessary and no neutralizing antibodies have been detected.",

MS patients should be notified that these therapies primarily slow the disease course but are not a cure. These drugs are typically continued indefinitely unless side effects are intolerable or the patient begins to fail in terms of response, after which use of another agent can be considered.",
