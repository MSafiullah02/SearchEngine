The coronavirus glycoprotein M is the most abundant protein of the viral particle and plays a crucial role in assembly and budding of virions [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. In silico analysis suggested that SARS\u2010CoV M consists of a long cytoplasmic tail, three transmembrane segments and a short N\u2010terminal ectodomain harbouring one potential N\u2010glycosylation site. To characterize SARS\u2010CoV M, we took advantage of a human monoclonal antibody (S30) derived from Epstein\u2010Barr virus\u2010immortalized memory B\u2010cells of a SARS convalescent [9]. In this study, we applied immunofluorescence analyses and biochemical approaches to investigate glycosylation and intracellular distribution of SARS\u2010CoV M in infected cells and after recombinant expression.",

            "text": "In Western blot analysis of purified virions, S30 recognized two viral structural proteins with an approximate molecular mass of 22 and 27 kDa (Fig. 1\nA, lane 2). The two proteins were also recognized by the serum of a convalescent (Fig. 1A, lane 1). Based on the molecular weight, it was suggested that these bands represented two different forms of M. Upon treatment of SARS\u2010CoV structural proteins with Endo H and PNGase F, the 27 K\u2010band disappeared while the migration pattern of the 22 K\u2010band was unaltered (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3). To verify the specificity of S30, M was in vitro translated from a plasmid, pTM1\u2010M. In the absence of canine pancreatic microsomes in the translation reaction, one protein could be detected migrating at 22 kDa. Expression of M in the presence of microsomes gave rise to an additional protein with an apparent molecular mass of 27 kDa (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 2). Both forms of M could be precipitated using S30 and protein\u2010A sepharose (Fig. 1C, lane 4). Next, asparagine at position four of M was substituted by glutamine and the protein was expressed in the presence of microsomes which led to only one protein product migrating at 22 kDa (Fig. 1C, lane 3). These results demonstrated that SARS\u2010CoV M is exclusively N\u2010glycosylated at asparagine 4 and, in addition, a nonglycosylated M is incorporated into the virion.",

This treatment led to a shift of both M\u2010specific bands to 18 and 23 kDa, respectively, suggesting that glycosylated and nonglycosylated M are partially protected against the proteinase K digestion (Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and 2). The molecular weight of the two proteolytic peptides was slightly larger than expected if the complete cytoplasmic domain (\u224811 kDa) was removed. Possibly, hydrophobic residues located near the third transmembrane domain are peripherally attached to the microsomal membrane and thereby protected against protease treatment [4]. The addition of the detergent Triton X\u2010100 to the protease K digestion led to the complete proteolysis of both forms of M (Fig. 1D, lane 3). These results are consistent with the presumption of a long cytoplasmic domain of M. The potential Nexo\u2013Cexo\u2010topology of TGEV\u2010M [10, 11] seems not to appear in M of SARS\u2010CoV.",

Cell lysates were analysed by immunoprecipitation using S30\u2010antibody and SDS\u2013PAGE (Fig. 2\nA). Right after labelling both, glycosylated and nonglycosylated M was detectable (lane 4). The amount of nonglycosylated M remained constant throughout the chase period whereas the level of Endo H\u2010sensitive M decreased (Fig. 2A \u201cMER\u201d). Concomitantly, Endo H\u2010resistant forms ranging from 29 to 35 kDa appeared and their amount increased during the chase (Fig. 2A \u201cMGolgi\u201d). This result suggested that upon recombinant expression, glycosylated M is transported through ER and Golgi\u2010complex and gains complex\u2010glycosylated sugar side chains a result, which confirmed data presented by Nal et al. Expanding their experimental approach, we were able to avoid any effect of epitope tags on the distribution and posttranslational modification and further to analyse the glycosylation and transport of M in the viral context using the M\u2010specific human monoclonal antibody. To this end, Vero cells were infected with SARS\u2010CoV and pulse\u2010chase experiments were performed under BSL\u20104 conditions as described before (Fig. 2B). During the chase, the ratio between nonglycosylated and glycosylated M remained constant, and no Endo H\u2010resistant forms appeared (Fig. 2B, lanes 4\u201321) suggesting that processing of N\u2010linked glycans is prevented in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected cells. Completely synthesized membrane associated nonglycosylated M is no target for N\u2010linked glycosylation suggesting that the protein has been transported out of the ER. This is underlined by the finding that nonglycosylated M is incorporated into the virion. This indicated that glycosylation of M is neither a prerequisite for intracellular transport nor for recruitment into virions which has been shown previously for other coronavirus M proteins [4, 12, 13, 14].",

Alternatively, M expressing cells were incubated with an anti\u2010ERGIC (ER\u2010Golgi\u2010intermediate\u2010compartment) antibody and S30 and respective fluorescently labelled secondary antibodies. While the signals for M and Golgi\u2010marker or ERGIC strongly colocalized, no or only a partial colocalization was observed with ER\u2010 or endosomal\u2010marker (Fig. 3B). These results are in line with previous studies on SARS\u2010CoV [21] and other coronaviruses [22, 23, 24], showing that recombinant M is enriched in the Golgi\u2010complex region. It is therefore presumed that differences in Endo H sensitivity of M in transfected and infected cells are not caused by a different intracellular distribution. More likely, trimming of the sugar side chain was prevented in the infected cell by the presence of S which sterically hindered the access of glycosidases. Results from Opstelten et al., showing that S and M of mouse hepatitis virus interact during the assembly of progeny, point into this direction [4, 7, 25, 26].",

N\u2010Flag\u2010M was recognized at the surface and intracellularly (Fig. 4\n, upper panels). The C\u2010Flag\u2010M, however, was only detectable in permeabilized cells confirming the intactness of the plasma membrane during the staining procedure and that the C\u2010terminus of M, indeed, faces the cytoplasm (Fig. 4, lower panels). These results indicated that singly expressed M is transported to the cell\u2010surface and confirmed the results of the complex\u2010type N\u2010glycosylation analyses. Nevertheless, although plasma membrane transport took place, the steady state localization of M was the Golgi\u2010complex. Further experiments have to elucidate whether M in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected cells is also transported to the plasma membrane like M of TGEV [27].",
