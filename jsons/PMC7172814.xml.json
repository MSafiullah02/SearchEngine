Due to the long turnaround time of serological detection and virus isolation, nucleic acid testing, such as real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), are more widely used for early diagnosis of this acute febrile disease [[10], [11], [12]]. Nevertheless, most PCR-based detection methods require sophisticated equipment and skilled personnel. Besides, LAMP faced problems of high false-positive rates and contamination, and the requirement for six primers adds up to the difficulty of primer design. Such limitations hampered the application of these nucleic acid detection methods as point-of-care diagnostic methods since the endemic areas of SFTS in China are usually rural mountain areas with limited medical resources [7].",

These enzymes show high activity at a constant temperature ranging from 37 to 42 \u00b0C. With the addition of reverse transcriptase and a fluorescence-modified probe, the RPA technique can also be used for real-time detection of RNA molecules. This user-friendly technique with short turnaround time can be a promising candidate for point-of-care detection assays in resource-limited SFTS endemic areas. In this study, a real-time reverse-transcription RPA (RT-RPA) assay for the rapid detection of SFTSV was established and the performance of this assay was evaluated with clinical specimens of suspected SFTS patients.",

The most commonly seen clinical manifestations of SFTSV infection, including fever, thrombocytopenia and lymphocytopenia, are often unspecific and need to be differentiated from other infectious diseases, such as haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, human anaplasmosis [6,14]. A recent study showed an increasing incidence of SFTSV-specific antibody seropositivity among healthy people in high endemic areas of China, suggesting the existence of asymptomatic SFTSV infections [15]. Human-to-human transmission through blood and/or body fluid contact or aerosols and resulting multiple cluster cases have also made SFTS a threat to public health [16,17]. Therefore, a rapid detection method is in urgent need for early diagnosis of SFTSV infection to improve clinical outcome and prevent transmission. Currently, the diagnosis of SFTS is based on serological methods and PCR-based viral nucleic acid testing [14]. However, specific antibodies to SFTSV are detectable after about 7 days from disease onset [18], and PCR-based nucleic acid tests usually require a centralized laboratory with high-end instrumentation and skilled personnel to perform. The novel RT-RPA technique might be an ideal candidate for point-of-care detection of SFTSV.",

While the sensitivity of this RT-RPA assay is lower in conventional RT-qPCR for SFTSV, the detection limit is still far below the viremia level in most clinical SFTS patients [18]. With the application of RT-RPA, the detection time was reduced to <30 min, whereas RT-qPCR generally takes >1.5 h. In addition to the reduced detection time, the constant reaction temperature of 39 \u00b0C allowed RT-RPA assays to be performed using simple equipment such as a water or metal bath, while RT-qPCR requires sophisticated thermocyclers. The short detection time and isothermal reaction condition therefore provided the RT-RPA assay with advantages over RT-qPCR as a point-of-care detection assay in resource-limited areas.",

The sensitivity and specificity are comparable with other established detection methods [10,11,[22], [23], [24], [25]]. One RPA-negative sample was positive by nest-PCR. The sequencing result of the RPA-negative sample revealed that there were several mismatches within the binding sites of the probe and the reverse primer. Previous study, regarding foot-and-mouth disease virus and human immunodeficiency virus, indicated that perhaps as a result of the length of primer and probe compensating for mismatches in target sequence, RPA can tolerate up to nine mismatches across the primer and probe binding sites [26,27]. However, in our study, one mismatch is located next to the fluorophore-modified nucleotide of the probe. Due to its location, it might hinder recognition of the tetrahydrofuran spacer by the double-strand-specific endonuclease IV and subsequent separation of the fluorophore/quencher complex, thereby, leading to significant reduction of fluorescence signal in the RT-RPA assay. Several studies also observed that mismatches covering the center and both extremities of the primer sequence would hamper RPA reaction [28]. Mismatches of probe show greater negative impact on the efficiency of RPA reaction than the primer, and RPA reaction efficiency decreases as the number of mismatches increases on the probe binding site [29]. Our SFTSV-specific probe and primers successfully distinguished target pathogen from fifteen other pathogens, exhibiting high specificity for SFTSV. Therefore, the RPA technique can probably be integrated into the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms and pathogen-differentiating diagnostic methods, like the SHERLOCK detection platform, combining RPA with CRISPR-Cas13a, does in detecting Dengue or Zika virus ssRNA as well as mutations [30].",

(B) Standard curves of SFTSV RT-RPA assays (red square, R2 = 0.967) and RT-qPCR assays (black triangle, R2 = 0.996). Each dilution was tested in three replicates by both assays. (C) Probit regression analysis of SFTSV RT-RPA assays predicted LOD at 95% probability (triangle). (D) No cross-reactivity was observed. Nucleic acids of fifteen non-SFTSV pathogens were tested, including PIV-1, PIV-2, measles virus, mumps virus, rubella virus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rotavirus, human adenovirus, HHV-1, HHV-2, HHV-3, HHV-5, HHV-6, and dengue virus.
