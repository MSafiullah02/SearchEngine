T lymphocytes first identified in the chordate lineage and constitute a highly sophisticated branch of adaptive immune system. Apart from B cells, it is the only cell type that exhibits antigenic specificities; achieved by gene rearrangement. T cells are unique with respect to diversity of their subsets, which have distinct effector specificities, proliferative abilities, memory generation, and life span. T cells are impactful in viral infections by virtue of their capability to combat intracellular pathogens. The effector functions of T cells are mediated through cytokines/chemokines and by direct cytotoxicity of infected cells. T cell response can be beneficial or detrimental to host; prognosis depending on qualitative and quantitative differences in the response. Persistent viral infections are associated with functionally suboptimal, exhausted T cell responses, which are unable to clear virus. Specific subsets such as regulatory T cells (Tregs) dampen antiviral responses; thereby favouring viral persistence. However, Tregs protect the host from immunopathology by limiting perpetual inflammation. Certain other subsets such as Th17 cells may contribute to autoimmune component of viral infections. The importance of T cells is highlighted by the fact that modern vaccination and therapeutic approaches focus on modulating T cell frequencies and effector functions. This chapter emphasises the understanding how T cells influence outcomes of viral infections, modern vaccination and therapeutic strategies with thrust on T cell biology. Achanta Jagadeesh, A. M. V. N. Prathyusha, G. Mohana Sheela and Pallaval Veera Bramhachari contributed equally with all other contributors.",

Mammals established a refined immune system to cope with several viral and bacterial infections (Garc\u00eda-Sastre and Biron 2006) . Remarkably, adaptive arm of immune responses is significant in action against virus particles and infected cells. T Lymphocytes are the key players in adaptive, cell-mediated immune responses and also in elimination of foreign pathogens by activating various immune responses. There exist many viruses for which both CD8 + and CD4 + T cells, reported to play key role in viral control viz. measles virus (Nelson et al. 2017) , cytomegalovirus (CMV) (Wehrens et al. 2016 ), hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Sheiko et al. 2016 ) and HIV (Jones and Walker 2016) . Typically, T H 1 cells are assumed to be efficient in antiviral T cell response. Nonetheless, many viruses can inhibit T H 1 response by downregulating interferons release from infected cells, which greatly influence outcome of virus infection (Laidlaw et al. 2016) . The humoral immune response involves antibodies specific for virus to block host-virus interactions, neutralize virus and recognise viral antigens on infected cells and activates antibody-dependent cytotoxic cells (ADCC) or complement-mediated lysis to kill infected cells. However, if these antibodies are ineffective, viruses are able to infect host cells where adaptive arm acts to control viral pathogenesis (Rosendahl Huber et al. 2014) .",

Some newly synthesized proteins may degrade into peptide fragments. If these peptides have sufficient binding affinity, to class I MHC molecules they appear on cell surface of an infected cell as class I MHC-peptide complex. This complex activates CD8 + T cells and induces infected cell apoptosis by releasing cytotoxic granules and production of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3. Activation of CD8 + T cells also occurs in draining lymph nodes, where antigen-presenting cells (APCs) encounter na\u00efve T cells. Priming of na\u00efve T cells will not only occur through classical pathway via infection of cell, but also through cross-presentation of viral peptides on MHC class I molecules, taken up from extracellular sources. Priming of T cells triggers a massive expansion of antigen-specific T cells. Their progeny usually accumulate in large numbers of armed effector T cells and these normally contribute to the eradication of viral pathogens.",

These phenotypic changes along with failure of immune system to clear pathogens in chronic infection exhaust functional T cell response. These primarily promote terminally differentiated T cells and inhibiting formation of CD8 + T cell memory. Furthermore, antiviral activity and CD8 + T cell response drastically increase when signalling through PD-1 is prevented. These observations signify that T cell immune response has ceased reversibly.

As a result, the production of IFNgamma, IL-2 and TNF-alfa are released (Zhao et al. 2010) .

            "text": "Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), a small DNA virus majorly infects birds, reptiles and mammals, there are 300 viral genotypes that have been discovered till now (Vande and Klingelhutz 2013). The HPV infects mucosal and/or cutaneous skin and causes benign or malignant tumours. HPV associates with cervical cancer, oral squamous carcinoma and Head and Neck cancers (Forman et al. 2012 ). The HPV oncoproteins, E6 and E7, majorly regulates the host immune responses and plays vital role in tumorigenesis (den Boon et al. 2015 ). The HPV16 viral particle involves in the host immune dysregulation by epigenetic mechanisms. The viral pathogenesis regulates the synthesis of chemokines that required for T cell activation, i.e. CXCL14 (Cicchini et al. 2016) . The CXCL14 synthesis regulated epigenetically by HPV viral protein, i.e. E7. Likewise, the HPV viral protein interacts with the host DNMT1 and stimulates the methylase activation (Burgers et al. 2007 ) and as a result, CXCL14 is repressed. Therefore, evasion of immune responses against virus, by inhibiting the T cell activation. The HPV16 E7 suppresses the production of proinflammatory responses like IL-8, IL18, CCL2, CCL20 (Cho et al. 2001; Guess and McCance 2005; Huang and McCance 2002; Kleine-Lowinski et al. 2003) Additionally, HPV16 E7 upregulates the immunosuppressive genes like IDO1 and it triggers the activation of Treg cells (Mittal et al. 2013) . Strikingly, the HPA18 E6 and E7 proteins jointy dysregulate the T cell activation by binding directly to the proteins involved in non-receptor tyrosine kinase signalling pathway (Li et al. 1999) . As result, it downregulates the IFN-alfa and other cytokines like IL-6 and IL12. The HPV proteins regulate the IFN signalling for its major mechanism in evading the host T cell responses. The MHC restriction is a typical immune escape used by the HPV protein E5 by downregulating the MHC-I complex (Ashrafi et al. 2005 (Ashrafi et al. , 2006 . Hence HPV hinders the activation of CD8 + T cell and evasion of host responses are dysregulated by viral proteins and favours for the tumour progression.",

The APC presentation by MHC and the presented processed peptide activates the TCR and CD4 and CD8 associated with MHC stabilises the TCR activation. The TCR activation supported by the co-stimulatory molecules like CD28/B7 activates the T cell proliferation. As a result, the IL-2 and other cytokines and chemokines are released. The TLR's are the receptors which activates the innate immunity and as a result, the activation of chemokines and cytokines are upregulated and various proliferative signals are activated with the response to the PAMP's. The na\u00efve T cells, as aresult differentiates into CD4 and further has different subsets like, Th1, Th2, Th17 and T reg. The other CD8 T and memory T cells are prominent cells in elimination of disease. The virus infection evades the acquired immunity and immune responses by various mechanisms. The viral antigen manipulates the host immune responses by inhibiting the proliferative signals, expressing exhausting receptors, MHC restriction and various anti-inflammatory cytokines. The viral proteins upregulate apoptotic genes and inhibits immune responses of T cells. Due to high diversity of viral proteins, the HLA polymorphism is restricted, hence the MHC restriction and MHC cross presentation makes more significant in the viral persistence. The TLR-7 and TLR-9 are majorly downregulated in the HBV and provide immune to the viral propagation. The differentiation of the CD4 Th cells into Regulatory T lymphocytes hinders the immune activation and provide immune-resistance to the virus. In few viral serotypes, the T memory cells fail to respond to the secondary infection. In VHF, the overexpression of cytokines like TNF-alfa, IFN-gamma and IL-6 are responsible for 'cytokine storm' and increase viremia and favour in disease progression. The NK cell-mediated immune evasion in cancer causing viruses is unique by causing exhaustion of T cell and therefore, inhibiting immune responses.",
