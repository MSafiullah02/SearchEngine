The complex RAAS regulates blood pressure, sodium and water retention and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme converts angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II, which mediates vasoconstriction, sodium and water retention and inflammation through the angiotensin type 1 receptor (red arrows). Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) counterbalances the angiotensin-II/angiotensin type 1 receptor pathway by converting angiotensin-II to angiotensin-(1-7), which binds the Mas receptor to mediate vasodilation and anti-inflammatory effects (yellow arrows). Importantly, the angiotensin-II/angiotensin type 1 receptor pathway leads to cleavage of membrane-bound ACE2 via ADAMS17 (green arrow). Severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds ACE2 and undergoes endocytosis to infect host cells. As a consequence, SARS-CoV-2 infection decreases membrane-bound ACE2 and impairs the beneficial effects of the angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis.",
