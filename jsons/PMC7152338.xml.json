            "text": "Coccidiosis is a hepatic or enteric disease caused by protozoan parasites of the subclass Coccidia, genus Eimeria. It is important to distinguish between infection by coccidia, which is common, and coccidiosis or overt disease, which is infrequent. Many rabbits are infected with coccidian parasites at least once during their life, and wild rabbits may be infected their entire lives with several species of coccidia that continually cycle through them, yet do not develop disease. Enhanced transmission of coccidia occurs when rabbits are brought together in large groups because of the rapid and direct life cycle of Eimeria species. Under these circumstances, coccidia cause disease. Consequently, coccidiosis is considered a major health problem in rabbits raised under intensive husbandry conditions.",
