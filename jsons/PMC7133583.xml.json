It has long been recommended that for respiratory infections like influenza, affected patients should wear masks to limit droplet spread. If everyone puts on a mask in public places, it would help to remove stigmatisation that has hitherto discouraged masking of symptomatic patients in many places.3 Furthermore, transmission from asymptomatic infected individuals has been documented for COVID-19, and viral load is particularly high at early disease stage.4, 5 Masking, as a public health intervention, would probably intercept the transmission link and prevent these apparently healthy infectious sources.",

Panic buying of masks in Hong Kong has gone unresolved for more than 30 days, and a similar situation seems to be developing in Italy. People wear masks to protect themselves in close person-to-person contacts, but unintentionally, they are protecting each other through source control. Disposable surgical masks and their technical specifications were designed specifically for the protection of health-care workers during occupational exposures. Cloth masks were used by surgeons successfully during operations before disposable masks were available. In real life, most people in all seriously affected areas are reusing their disposable masks. All governments must prepare to handle the probable mass panic and explore other sustainable alternatives to the disposable masks for effective source control in community settings.",
