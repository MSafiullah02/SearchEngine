Benkouiten et al. followed one Hajj travel group (n = 129) from Marseille, France, and studied an array of microorganisms including bacteria and uncommon viruses, whereas Barasheed et al. selected participants from several travel groups who developed respiratory symptoms; they were closely followed up in a large trial (n = 1038) involving Saudi Arabian, Australian and Qatari pilgrims.",

One caveat is that the definition of ILI differed between the studies (Table 1). The attack rate of laboratory\u2010proven influenza in Annan et al.'s study was lower than in other studies (Benkouiten et al. and Barasheed et al.) (Table 1). This could be influenced by differences in influenza vaccine uptake. For instance, none of the French recruits received the 2013 influenza vaccine, while 69% of the participants in Barasheed et al.'s study did. The rate of influenza A was 7% and 4%, respectively 6, 7. Annan et al. 1 reported an attack rate for influenza of 1.1%, but did not provide influenza vaccination data. Of interest, influenza was circulating in tropical Africa during the Hajj 2013 10.",

However, the higher rate of RSV reported by Annan et al. is not unexpected; a higher attack rate of 9% was reported among returned symptomatic UK pilgrims after the Hajj 2005 11. Rashid et al. also showed that during the same year the attack rate of RSV among UK pilgrims in Makkah was 4% 12. By contrast, during the subsequent Hajj season, the attack rate of RSV was very low (0.7%) among UK pilgrims and zero among Saudi pilgrims 13 indicating that the circulation of RSV is dependent on various factors such as seasonality, geographical original of the pilgrims and their close association with children.",

A recent estimate suggests that MERS\u2010CoV has a basic reproduction number (R0) similar to that of SARS, that is 2\u20136.7 14, but mathematical modelling studies indicate that the risk of an outbreak is low 15. Considering the increasing number of Umrah pilgrims in the forthcoming months when the likelihood of a MERS\u2010CoV upsurge is high due to the seasonal pattern of the disease 16, surveillance must continue. Accordingly, we continued our study in 2014 and recruited over 2000 pilgrims from Gulf countries and Australia. Preliminary findings suggest that of 298 Australian pilgrims, only two (0.7%) had symptoms of severe respiratory infection, but none had pneumonia. Virological testing will provide further data on the epidemiology of respiratory viruses among Hajj pilgrims. Ongoing active surveillance is mandatory to better understand transmission dynamics of MERS\u2010CoV.",
