Clinical drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed to decrease the high fatality rate of confirmed COVID-19 patients. Traditional de novo drug discovery needs more than 10 years, so drug repurposing seems the best option currently to find potential drugs for treating COVID-19. Results: Compared with traditional non-covalent drugs, covalent drugs have attracted escalating attention recent years due to their advantages in potential specificity upon careful design, efficiency, and patient burden. We recently developed a computational protocol named as SCAR for discovering covalent drugs. In this work, we used the SCAR protocol to identify possible covalent drugs (approved or clinically tested) targeting the main protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2. We identified 11 potential hits, among which at least 6 hits were exclusively enriched by the SCAR protocol. Since the preclinical or clinical information of these identified drugs is already available, they might be ready for being clinically tested in the treatment of COVID-19",

            "text": "Starting December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause took place in Wuhan, Hubei province of China (Chaolin Huang et al., 2020) . In a short time, Chinese authorities rapidly isolated and characterized a novel coronavirus closely related to the SARS-CoV that caused the outbreak of a severe acute respiratory syndrome 18 years ago in China (Zhou et al., 2020) . The newly identified coronavirus was initially represented by 2019-nCoV, but formally named as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) on February 12 th , 2020. Meanwhile, the disease caused by this virus was named as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO). Although China has adopted unprecedented policies to control the spread of the virus including temporarily \"shutting down\" the Wuhan City on January 23 rd , 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in over 70,000 COVID-19 patients and more than 2,000 fatalities worldwide by February 20 th , 2020. With an estimated case fatality rate of 2%-3% and the growing patient numbers, SARS-CoV-2 poses a serious health threat to the whole world (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/). Unfortunately, specific clinical treatments for the rapidly escalating international crisis caused by SARS-CoV-2 are very limited, which is one of the reasons of the high mortality rate. Due to the deficiency of targeted drugs, the current clinical treatment of COVID-19 focuses on supportive care and symptom relief. Remdesivir, an experimental drug developed to treat the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has been reported to be effective in treating several COVID-19 cases, but a systematic clinical trial of this drug is still ongoing in Wuhan, China (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04257656). Similarly, chloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and many other drugs have also been reported to be potentially effective, but supportive clinical data are not available for all (Maxmen, 2020) . Therefore, it is of great value to identify more potential drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 to save COVID-19 patients.",

Therefore, it is virtually not possible to develop de novo drugs in the time frame needed to impact the current SARS-CoV-2 crisis. Hence, the most feasible approach is to find potential cures from clinical drugs by drug repurposing (also known as drug repositioning, reprofiling, redirecting, or rediscovering). Drug repurposing can rapidly expand target disease indications of an existing drug while saving time and money, since the data for human pharmacokinetics, safety and the preclinical results are already available (Cha et al., 2018) . Successful examples of drug repurposing include the use of sildenafil in treating erectile dysfunction and the anti-cancer uses of thalidomide (Pushpakom et al., 2019) .",

Realizing the potential use of SCAR in discovering both covalent and non-covalent inhibitors, we recently demonstrated that SCAR is also quite efficient in drug repurposing (Y. Zhang et al., 2020) . Compared with non-covalent drugs, covalent drugs have the following advantages (Mah et al., 2014) : (i) covalent drugs have better biochemical efficiency since they are more competitive than many non-covalent endogenous substrates and cofactors; (ii) covalent drugs cause lower patient burden and delay the emergence of drug resistance due to lower and less frequent dosing; (iii) covalent drugs might have better target specificity by reacting with a non-conserved nucleophilic amino acid with careful designs (Cuesta et al., 2020) . Therefore, recent years have witnessed the resurgence of the discovery of covalent drugs. As a result, we set out to use SCAR to identify possible covalent drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 by drug repurposing in this work. The protein pocket is shown in surface and the inhibitor in sticks. The covalent bond is indicated by the arrow. (B) The binding poses of the identified hits. The putative reactive atoms in the drugs are indicated by black arrows. The protein without the SCAR mutation (C145G) was used for representation, and the yellow surface close to the arrow represents Cys145. The steric conflicts between the reactive atoms and Cys145 are expected, which can be eliminated by the covalent bonding between the drug and Cys145. Table 1. The potential drugs that might be repurposed as covalent inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro from the SCAR strategy. Docking score and conformation rank are listed for the identified pose. Atom distance is the distance between the putative reactive atom of the drug and Cys145-SG. SCAR enriching score is calculated as the top docking score of the drug docked to the wild-type 3CLpro minus the listed docking score. ",

Therefore, 3CLpro is a key drug target in inhibiting SARS-CoV. The recent data showed that the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro is highly similar with the SARS-CoV 3CLpro both in sequence and structure (PDB ID: 6LU7). Previous studies demonstrated that Cys145 is a key residue in the active site of 3CLpro (Changkang Huang et al., 2004) , which makes this residue be an attractive target for covalent bonding of covalent 3CLpro inhibitors. Cysteine is also a most popular target of covalent inhibitors because its high intrinsic reactivity at physiological pH permits the use of relatively unreactive electrophiles (Cuesta et al., 2020) . Meanwhile, targeting cysteine renders the high selectivity of covalent inhibitors due to the low prevalence of cysteine in the proteome (Cuesta et al., 2020) .",

These hits contain five different covalent warhead groups suitable for targeting cysteine, which represents diverse structural options. As shown in Figure 1B , the putative covalent poses of the identified hits fit in the binding pocket reasonably. In each drug, the distance between the putative nucleophilic atom and the SG atom of Cys145 is shown in Table 1 . In 6LU7 (PDB ID), the distance between the covalent carbon atom of the inhibitor and the SG atom of Cys145 is 1.8 \u00c5. Therefore, the proximity between these two atoms indicates high potential for covalent bonding between the drug and Cys145.",

For quantitative comparison, we took the lowest score of each compound in the regulardock results. Then we compared the difference between this lowest score with the score of the same compound in the SCAR-dock results (represented as \"SCAR enriching score\"). A note is that we used the score of the pose oriented for covalent bonding in SCAR-dock, which is the lowest score only if the rank of the conformation is 1 ( Table 1) . As shown in Table 1 , for 6 out of these 11 compounds (54.5%), the SCARdock protocol generated lower scores (higher affinities, corresponding to positive SCAR enriching scores). This result might indicate that the SCAR protocol can generate better binding poses than the regular docking protocol if the compounds can covalently bind to Cys145, although experimental validations will be necessary. Base on the parameters in Table 1 , we suggest the following ones might have higher priorities: Telcagepant, Vidupiprant, Poziotinib, and Fostamatinib.",

According to our previous studies, the hits from the SCAR protocol could have different reactive (bonding) activities. One reason is that the SCAR protocol does not consider the reactive activity of the warhead in a compound. The other reason is that the reactive activity of a warhead is affected by the attached scaffold, and the prediction of a warhead's reactive activity is still a profoundly challenging issue. Considering the worldwide health risk posed by SARS-CoV-2, although wet experiments are needed to validate our computational hits, we hope our work will provide more options for the rapid identification of targeted drugs to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and save COVID-19 patients in time.",
