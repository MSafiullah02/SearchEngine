Current treatment modalities for tumors or cancers mainly focus on surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, among which medicine treatment is still the most widely used therapeutic way for various types of tumors or cancers (Xiao et al. 2017). Nevertheless, typical anticancer therapies, such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy, cannot always work for the patients, even they helpful, they may not cure the patients completely (Weeks et al. 2012). Besides, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are also well known as their adverse side effects due to the treatment cannot distinguish the similarity between cancerous cells and healthy human cells (Emmenegger and Kerbel 2010; Karimi et al. 2016; Abou-Elkacem et al. 2016; Fan et al. 2016; Park et al. 2016). What\u2019s more, drug resistance, insufficient curative effect, and tumor relapse during therapeutic process are still the huge challenges when patients treated by conventional cytotoxic drugs or molecularly targeted therapeutics (Al-Lazikani et al. 2012; Yano et al. 2012), and the efficacy of typical anticancer therapies is usually limited in clinic.",

The technology of nucleic acid amplification strategy opens up avenues for meeting this clinical diagnosis requirement in theranostics. Hybridization chain reaction (HCR), rolling-circle amplification (RCA), the strand displacement reaction (SDR), loop-mediated amplification (LAMP), and target-recycling amplification with endonuclease, exonuclease, and polymerase, and these nucleic acid amplification strategies have already become powerful tools for early diagnosis of cancer, due to their high sensitivity, excellent stability, and subtly designability, which demonstrate good prospects to meet clinical requirements, and assist DDS employed in theranostics.",

By modification of different functional elements in the surface of MNP/DNA-SP, such as aptamers and disulfide linkages, the synthesized MNP/DNA-SP-DOX can be used for targeted GSH or CEM cells detection and doxorubicin delivery, resulting in the relief of cell apoptosis in target GSH or CEM cells, as shown in Fig. 14.2. For those that have not yet been screened by their aptamers specifically, functional element (e.g., FA) modified poly T tailed sequences were taken to MNP/DNA-SP by terminal transferase-mediated chain elongation. Different functional elements as ligands for different targets can be incorporated into MNP/DNA-SP, which can achieve versatile targeted and detection applications. The advantages of MNP/DNA-SP-DOX cargo displayed high selectivity, superior biocompatibility, and convenient drug delivery. The potent antitumor efficacy of DOX delivered by the biocompatible MNP/DNA-SP nanocarrier was also tested in a model of xenografted tumors of mice. Consequently, the result is a combination of traceable targeted detection and drug delivery that serves as a multifunctional MNP/DNA-SP, which will provide a novel theranostic platform for cancer targets detection and may also approve other clinical applications.\n",

To realize the specific targeting cancerous cell delivery, they employed folic acid (FA) as active targeting ligands to functionalize MNP/RNA NF and constructed FA/MNP/RNA NF nanostructure. While for specific binding, folate receptors (FRs) is a wise choice for specific binding of FA, which is overexpressed on the cancer cell membrane, while low expressed in the normal cell. The anticancer drug DOX as well as the photosensitizer TMPyP4, which could generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) with 650 nm light, was both loaded into this FA/MNP/RNA NF nanocarrier. The result showed that FA/MNP/RNA NF nanocarrier has better treatment efficacy than DOX traditional delivery way. Additionally, FA/MNP/RNA NF could also be used as a probe for HeLa cells\u2019 detection, and it can detect as low as 50 cells (Guo et al. 2017b). Thus, the nucleic acid amplification technique assisted by MNPs holds great promise for potential applications in cancer diagnostics and therapeutics.\n",

The aptamer probe (AP) used in this system is designed to trigger HCR on binding to the target cell via structure switching, instead of initiating HCR in its free state, skillfully. The HCR not only amplifies fluorescence signals from a fluorescence-quenched probe (H1) for activatable tumor imaging but also accumulates high-load prodrugs from a drug-labeled probe (H2) and induces its uptake and conversion into cisplatin in cells for selective tumor therapy. The in vitro result showed that this approach affords efficient signal amplification for fluorescence detection of target protein tyrosine kinase-7 (PTK7) with a detection limit of 1 pM. Live cell studies also reveal that this approach provides high-contrast fluorescence imaging and highly sensitive detection of tumor cells, while renders high-efficiency drug delivery into tumor cells via an endocytosis pathway. The results imply the potential of the HCR approach as a promising platform for early-stage disease diagnosis and precise cancer therapy (Fig. 14.5).\n",

            "text": "Definitely, in theranostics, it is essential to monitor the expression of low-abundance biomarkers and transport a high-load drug to target cancer cells (Srinivasarao et al. 2015). Aptamers are single RNA or DNA strand with unique intramolecular conformations for selective binding to various targets. Aptamer-ligand recognition depends on the precise stacking of flat moieties, specific hydrogen bonding, and molecular shape complementarity (Bock et al. 1992; Jayasena 1999; Hermann and Patel 2000). Aptamer possesses dominant advantages over antibodies in terms of size, synthetic accessibility, and chemical modification. Therefore, aptamers are under worldwide development as a potential diagnostic or therapeutic tool in theranostics (Table 14.2) (Keefe et al. 2010).\n",

How to discriminate different types of cancer cells still remains challenging in the detection step due to the subtle differences in cancer cell expression of membrane receptors. Zhang\u2019s group developed a multicolor cell imaging method for distinguishing different types of cancer cells with fluorophore-tagged aptamers (Fig. 14.6) (Wang et al. 2014). Aptamer sequence and aptamer-labeled dyes affect the recognition process between aptamers and cancer cells. For different cancer cell lines, even though they own the same biomarkers, when interact the fluorophore-tagged aptamers with different cancer cell lines in different degree, the result turned out that there is a distinct color to discriminate different types of cancer cells at single cell level. Based on cross-reactive ability of the fluorophore-tagged aptamers, distinguish the cancer cells from large quantities of normal cells quickly, and identify different types of the cancer cells are achieved, simultaneously. These fluorophore-tagged aptamers have a promising application for cancer diagnostic and therapy in the future.\n",

            "text": "As one of the class of therapeutic nucleoside and nucleobase analogues drugs, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) has been used in cancer therapy and in the treatment of various diseases for decades (Longley et al. 2003). Therefore, in DDS, nanoparticles, nanogels, and nanopolymers are mainly focus on 5-FU cellular delivery for cancer therapy (Burke et al. 2014). By applying a cell-specific cytotoxic aptamer, Sven\u2019s group found that it can be prepared in a one-step enzymatic reaction by incorporating multiple units of a nucleoside analogue directly into an aptamer that targets a cytokine receptor. In targeted cancer cells, the controlled cellular release of 5-FU is initiated by intracellular nucleolytic hydrolysis of the cell-specific cytotoxic aptamer (Kruspe and Hahn 2014). Cytotoxic nucleoside and nucleobase analogues, such as 5-fluoro-2\u2019-deoxyuridine (5-FUdR), are advantageous drugs for receptor-mediated active targeting as they benefit from this intracellular turnover. As showed in Fig. 14.7, 5-FUdR becomes part of the aptamer molecule itself, replacing all the uridines in the original aptamer. The controlled release of the drug inside the target cells is mediated through naturally occurred degradation by lysosomal nucleases. The hydrolysis of the aptamer would yield 5-FUdR, which could escape the lysosome by active nucleoside transporters, which normally serve as recycling gateways for lysosomal degraded nucleic acids (Fig. 14.7).\n",
