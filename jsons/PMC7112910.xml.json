            "text": "The 1953 discovery of the structure of DNA ushered a revolution in molecular biology, leading to an increased understanding of the central dogma and the subsequent development of invaluable molecular biology techniques, including the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), electrophoresis and automated sequencing, culminating in the completion of the human genome project (HGP) in 2003. The last decade has seen an avalanche of information gleaned in the post-HGP era, such as gene assignation, identification of disease related mRNA biomarkers, as well as the discovery of the importance of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and methylated DNA. To date, the vast majority of genotyping techniques require a previous step of amplification, routinely carried out using the robust PCR thermal cycling methodology, and more recently quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). However, these techniques inherently require the use of thermocycler and a reliable power supply, thus restricting their use to laboratories. To address requirements of amplification for use in low-resource settings, or at the point-of-need, isothermal DNA amplification methods have been developed, including nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), strand displacement amplification (SDA), rolling circle amplification (RCA), the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), helicase-dependent amplification (HDA), as well as the recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA). The characteristics of these isothermal approaches are summarised in Table 1\nand the advantages and disadvantages of each technique has been extensively reviewed elsewhere [1], [2], [3]. RPA is remarkable due to its simplicity, high sensitivity, selectivity, compatibility with multiplexing, extremely rapid amplification, as well as its operation at a low and constant temperature, without the need for an initial denaturation step or the use of multiple primers. Overall, RPA positions itself very favourably for widespread exploitation in kits and assays for use at the point-of-care or point-of-need, as well as in affordable, sensitive, specific, user friendly, rapid, robust, equipment-free and delivered (ASSURED) devices, in low-resource settings.",

The RPA process starts when a recombinase protein uvsX from T4-like bacteriophages bind to primers in the presence of ATP and a crowding agent (a high molecular polyethyleneglycol), forming a recombinase-primer complex. The complex then interrogates double stranded DNA seeking a homologous sequence and promotes strand invasion by the primer at the cognate site. In order to prevent the ejection of the inserted primer by branch migration, the displaced DNA strand is stabilised by single-stranded binding proteins. Finally, the recombinase disassembles and a strand displacing DNA polymerase (e.g. large fragment of Bacillus subtilis Pol 1, Bsu) binds to the 3\u2032 end of the primer to elongate it in the presence of dNTPs. Cyclic repetition of this process results in the achievement of exponential amplification (Fig. 1\n).",

            "text": "Whilst it was initially believed that specifically designed primers of 30\u201335 bases in length were necessary for RPA, there are several reports demonstrating that normal PCR primers can be used and efficient amplification achieved [5], [6]. Longer primers (up to 45 nucleotides) can be used, but they could lead to secondary structures and potential primer artifacts. It is also recommended to avoid long tracks of guanines at the 5\u2032 ends while cytidines may be beneficial, whilst guanines and cytidines at the 3\u2032 tend to improve performance. A GC content below 30% or above 70% is not recommended and, as with PCR primers, sequences that promote primer-primer interactions, secondary structures or hairpins should not be used. RPA can amplify targets up to 1,5 kb but is better suited to amplicons between 100 and 200bp. The primer selection process is thus the same as that used for PCR and involves four steps: choice of target region, design of primer candidates, experimental screening, and, if necessary, secondary and tertiary candidate screening. To date, there is no software available to design primers for RPA. The use of self-avoiding molecular recognition (SAMRs) oligonucleotides can also be employed, where natural bases are replaced by A*, T*, G* and C*, where A* pairs with T, T* with A, G* with C, and C with G, but A* does not pair with T* and G* does not pair with C*, thus avoiding the formation of primer-dimers [7].",

            "text": "The crowding agent affects key biochemical process during the RPA reaction. Among them, it prevents the spontaneous recombinase-primer disassembly that occurs in the presence of the single stranded binding proteins needed for the amplification. However, the crowding agent has a negative impact on RPA performance at low target copy levels due to its viscosity, thus impeding the diffusion of reagents through the reaction mixture and inherently increasing amplification time. To minimise this effect, a mixing step is included 5 min after initiation of the RPA reaction, or, alternatively, mixing can be avoided by reducing the total volume of the reaction mixture to 5 \u03bcL [12]. An alternative strategy is to continuously mix the reaction solution, where an active matrix for electrowetting-on-dielectric facilitates continuous mixing of 270 nL or 750 nL of RPA cocktail, improving the limit of detection 100 times as compared to the benchtop assay [13]. The use of a phase-guided passive batch microfluidic chamber actuated by a syringe resulted in a reduction of the mixing time from hours to 1 min [14].",

In the presence of the target, a sandwich comprising magnetic beads, antibodies, target and aptamer is formed. The sandwich is then magneto-captured, the solution removed and the bound aptamers are amplified using RPA and detected using fluorescence. Another example of the combination of RPA with aptamer detection was based on the immobilisation of \u03b2-conglutin on magnetic beads and following a competition assay, aptamers bound to the magnetic bead immobilised target are eluted, amplified by RPA and detected fluorescently [24], or via lateral flow [16].",

            "text": "Amplification can be executed in solution, with both primers in the solution phase, or, alternatively, on a solid phase, when one primer is immobilised on a surface and the other primer is in solution. In a more challenging approach, termed bridge amplification, both forward and reverse primers are immobilised on a surface. However, the vast majority of reports describing RPA exploit solution-phase amplification [25], [26]. In solution-phase, due to the unimpeded diffusion of primers and reaction reagents, amplification kinetics are favoured and the achieved limit of detection is subsequently usually better and amplification is achieved in a faster time than solid-phase. Nevertheless, solid-phase and bridge amplification present some advantages, such as the potential for spatially resolved multiplexed amplification or the possibility to couple the amplification with diverse detection techniques including ring resonators [27], [28], [29], electrochemical [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36] and colorimetric detection [5], [6], [30], [33], [37], [38]. Several methods have been developed with solid phase amplification with performances usually inferior to that achieved with solution phase amplification [5], [27], [28], [29], [30], [39] as primer accessibility is more restricted impeding amplification efficiency, and future work will need to focus on strategies to decrease amplification time. Efforts to optimise the surface chemistry of the immobilised primers, exploiting vertical and horizontal spacers to enhance solid phase amplification has been reported [40]. To decrease the reaction time and improve the limit of detection, the surface-immobilised primer can also be introduced in the solution phase in an approach termed hemi-nested asymmetric solid-phase amplification [41], [42], [43]. Finally, when both primers are surface-tethered, bridge amplification can take place, but the required reaction time increases and the limit of detection can be compromised. Nevertheless, bridge amplification allows multiplexing with a high number of different targets and novel labelling strategies could be exploited to improve the achievable detection limit [44].",

However, another study found that while 1,25% (v/v) of urine has no impact on amplification efficacy, 10% (v/v) did inhibit amplification when small amounts of target DNA were present in the sample (100 fg), but, this inhibition is not observed when the target DNA concentration is higher (10 pg), even at 10% (v/v) urine [51].

Primer, probe ratios and concentrations thus need to be carefully optimised for each multiplexing assay. Primers can compete for the recombinase proteins, with one of the reactions consequently being suppressed [53]. Examples of successful multiplexing RPA in solution, include the detection of different MRSA alleles and an internal control [4], a fluorescent duplex RPA assay for Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome mec and an internal control [54], and a real time fluorescent duplex RPA for C. coli and C. jejuni in chicken products [53]. A multiplex assay of three bacterial pathogens based on solid phase amplification and fluorescent detection using a reverse primer modified with a fluorescent tag has been described [39], and a similar approach detailed the use of asymmetric solid phase multiplexing RPA for the detection of two human viruses and the bacterium E. faecalis using chemiluminescence detection [43]. Further examples include duplex RPA for cancer genotyping with label free Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) detection [55] and triplex RPA for three different plant pathogens using SERS nanotags and modified primers [56]. Finally, a triplex lateral flow assay for the detection of intestinal protozoa was developed, but still requires significant further optimisation to improve the detection limits [57].",

            "text": "RPA has been described as highly specific, with 100% specificity for the target sequence in most cases. However, RPA has been reported to be dependent on the number and distribution of mismatches in the sequence of closely related DNA molecules, where 1 or more mismatches cannot be differentiated, depending on their distribution. However, more than 1 mismatch at the 3\u2032 end of primers has been observed to effectively prevent or reduce amplification, which has also been observed for 3 mismatches at both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends, or at the centre of the primer [60]. Whilst this may limit RPA's usefulness in using sequence specific primers, its tolerance to mismatches can be exploited to develop methods to determine the presence of emerging variant pathogens when it is not necessary to discriminate from the wild-type target as exemplified by a method developed to detect HIV-1 proviral DNA, where even 9 changes across the primer and probe binding sites are tolerated by RPA, allowing the detection of different virus strains [61]. However, this tolerance to mismatches can also lead to cross-reactivity as demonstrated by an RPA assay developed to detect the three different genotypes of Chikungunya virus that was observed to have cross-reactivity with another related alphavirus, the O'nyong'nyong virus, based on 4 to 7 mismatches in the primers. A further example is an assay to determine Leishmania donovi that was observed to also amplify other Leishmania spp [62]. However, a method to detect EGFR mutations in lung cancer cells with specificity of just one base mismatch or single nucleotide polymorphism has been developed. Background amplification was reduced via the use of peptide nucleic acids, as PNA-DNA interactions are stronger than DNA-DNA, and one single mismatch is more destabilising than a normal DNA-DNA mismatch, thus improving specificity. However, an extra step is required to allow genomic DNA \u2013 PNA hybridization, heating to 99\u00b0C and then cooling down to 66\u00b0C, moving away from the attractive isothermal nature of RPA [38].",

Furthermore, similar to the use of PNA, the use of natural dNTPs vs locked nucleic acids was compared.

The probe is recommended to be a 46\u201352 oligonucleotide modified at the 5\u2032 end with an antigenic label at the 3\u2032 end, with a polymerase extension blocking group and an internal abasic nucleotide analogue that substitutes one nucleotide found in the target sequence. The antigenic label is usually a carboxyfluorescein group (FAM), but others, including Alexa fluor488 or digoxigenin are also good candidates [57]. The abasic nucleotide (a tetrahydrofuran residue that replaces a conventional nucleotide, also called a dSpacer), is placed at least 30 nucleotides from the 5\u2032 end and 15 nucleotides from the 3\u2032end. This dSpacer can be cleaved by an nfo nuclease, but only when the probe forms double stranded DNA. The cleavage produces a new 3\u2032 hydroxyl group in the probe, thus transforming the probe into a primer. In addition to the probe, an opposing amplification primer labelled at the 5\u2032-end with another label (e.g. biotin) is required. The second primer used is a conventional primer equidirectional to the probe. The amplicon produced in the presence of the probe and the two primers will include the two labels on one DNA amplicon, ready to be detected in a sandwich assay format by antibodies or antibody/streptavidin (Fig. 2\n).",

The same group reported another example of a paper and plastic microfluidic device that was self-sealing and self-contained once all reagents were loaded and only required a heat source, bringing the implementation of nucleic acid testing in a low-resource setting closer to reality [66]. An alternative RPA-lateral flow assay used tailed primers (primer containing a carbon stopper to generate double stranded DNA flanked by single stranded tails), to generate double tailed amplicons. Oligo-functionalised AuNPs were used as reporter probes and oligonucleotides as capture probes in the test and control line, instead of the conventional antigen label and antibody capture approach [67], decreasing the cost of the strip.",

The compartmentalisation approaches developed include digital plasma separation [20], centrifugal step emulsification [133], SlipChip technology [134] and picoliter array based technology [135]. In digital plasma separation, the compartmentalisation and plasma separation is carried out passively using microfluidic chips with a microcliff structure that is actuated by passive degassed driven flow, inertia and sedimentation [20]. In centrifugal step emulsification, the compartmentalisation is achieved in droplets, produced by centrifugation using an inlet chamber. One channel is connected to a chamber by a nozzle and droplet production, and read-out of the amplification with a Smartphone-based device takes place in the same chamber [133]. As described previously, in SlipChip technology two plates are clamped together to create channels and wells for the creation of individual compartments [134], and finally, picoliter array based chips on fabricated silicon and passivated with methoxy-PEG-silane agent facilitates the performance of up to 27,000 reactions in picoliter sized wells [135].",

The majority of reports since then have focused on a wide range of different applications of RPA, but there are an increasing number of publications that detail methodologies to improve the performance of RPA and to further its capabilities. RPA is remarkable among isothermal amplification techniques due to its simplicity, high sensitivity, selectivity, compatibility with multiplexing, rapid amplification, as well as its operation at a low and constant temperature, without the need for an initial denaturation step or the use of multiple primers. RPA can amplify as low as 1\u201310 target copies in less than 20 min even in the presence of some known PCR inhibitors or in crude extracts. The technique has been successfully used to amplify both RNA and DNA targets in different kinds of organisms, in both the solution and solid phase. A wide variety of detection strategies are compatible with RPA, and some of these have been tested with real samples with performances similar or better than PCR.",

Whilst most other isothermal amplification methods operate between 30 and 65\u00b0C, RPA takes advantage of enzymes and crowding agents to work at a low temperature ranging between 37 and 42\u00b0C and there is no requirement for a tight control of the temperature within this range, which is a particularly positive attribute not possessed by the other isothermal techniques. RPA, as well as NASBA and HDA do not require an initial denaturation step to generate ssDNA from the dsDNA target, in contrast to SDA, RCA and LAMP, highlighting its suitability for use in the field. In addition, RPA, in common with NASBA, RCA and SDA only requires 2 primers per target, which could position it to be more compatible with multiplexed amplification. RPA is also a very rapid method of amplification, markedly faster than other isothermal amplification methods and even though 15\u201325 min is recommended, efficient amplification can even be achieved in less than 5 min, depending on the target. RPA reagents are provided in a lyophilised format and are stable at ambient temperature for at least 6 months, whilst the reagents for all the other isothermal techniques require refrigeration, and this again positions RPA as being highly suited to implementation in point-of-need/care and ASSURED devices.",

            "text": "However, RPA does have some limitations, the principle one being that RPA kits are only sold by one company, which could have an impact on pricing, and the user also has limited flexibility in the kit formulation and whilst tailor-designed kits are available (e.g. without polymerase, without dNTPs), they are costly at low volumes. RPA normally requires purification/protein digestion following amplification, or will result in smearing or impaired flow in the cases of agarose gel electrophoresis and lateral flow, respectively. RPA, like PCR can be inhibited by high concentrations of genomic DNA, and as is the case with real time PCR, the use of SYBR Green [4] or Eva Green [23] cannot discriminate between amplicons and primer-dimer artefacts. Furthermore, real-time PCR conventional probes such as Taq-Man probes are not compatible with RPA because the Taq-Man polymerases digest the displaced strand during the strand displacing process due to the 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 exonuclease activity, thus preventing amplification. In fact, real-time amplification using RPA is not straightforward as it is based a time threshold instead of a cycle threshold, which is dependent on RPA kinetics. This time threshold is dictated not only by the initial target concentration but also by the temperature and mixing step. It is advisable to slow down the RPA reaction rate in order to have a better control during real-time RPA and this can be achieved by decreasing the magnesium acetate concentration. However, as the time of adding the magnesium and the effectiveness of mixing will have a strong impact on RPA kinetics, and ideally real-time RPA should be completely automated. Whilst RPA seems particularly suitable for multiplexed amplification, this requires extensive optimisation of primer concentrations as primers compete for the recombinase proteins and ratios of each need to be tested experimentally as primers for one target can suppress the amplification of another target. Furthermore, to date there is no software available for the design of primers specific for RPA and this can result in lengthy optimisation of the primer sequences. Different DNA targets, even with the same GC content, primer melting temperature and amplicon length, can be amplified with extremely different efficiencies and the basis for this is still not well understood.",

Recently RPA reagents have become available in a liquid format and it can be envisaged that increased flexibility in the kit formulation will allow an improved optimisation of assay conditions and facilitate a better understanding of the RPA mechanism. Currently \u201coptimisation\u201d depends on using a pellet, half pellet, quarter pellet etc., and as mentioned above, different targets are amplified with different efficiencies, and whilst RPA does appear to be particularly amenable to multiplexed detection, quite a laborious optimisation is currently required, but with more control of the amplification mix, this could become more simplified. Indeed, with the increasing interest in the simultaneous detection and sometimes also quantification of biomarkers, it is expected that there will be an exponential increase in the number of reports detailing parallelised amplification in solution-phase, in separate reservoirs in microfluidic systems, or on separate electrodes of an electrode array for solid-phase amplification, where multiplexing can be facilitated by spatial separation. Real-time RPA also requires extensive optimisation to truly control the amplification rate and to define properly the time threshold. To date real-time RPA has been achieved using fluorescent and ring-resonator detection, and other detection methodologies may further enhance the possibilities of real-time RPA, possibly even achieving highly multiplexed real-time quantitative RPA. The use and optimisation of RPA for differentiating single base differences (SNPs/mutation) or for the amplification of a family of species needs to be further explored as very few reports addressing this theme exists to date.",
