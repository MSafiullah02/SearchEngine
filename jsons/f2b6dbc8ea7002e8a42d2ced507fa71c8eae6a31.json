The initial attempts to eliminate PI BVDV animals utilized the presence of BVDV antibodies to declare an animal as a non PI animal. This was an erroneous approach to detecting and eliminating PI animals. Review of diagnostic laboratory accessions found PI calves that had BVDV1a serum antibodies. The BVDV isolates were subsequently found to be BVDV2 based on PCR. These calves were later found to have been vaccinated with a MLV vaccine containing BVDV1a NADL strain [24] . In another study, a PI calf with the BVDV1b strain developed BVDV1a serum antibodies to the Singer strain following vaccination with MLV BVDV1a Singer vaccine [25] .

There is the potential that new BVDV strains could develop after PI calves are vaccinated with MLV vaccines containing heterologous BVDV. Ridpath and Bolin [22] reported that a NCP and CP pair of BVDV2 were isolated from an animal dying of MD three months after vaccination with a MLV BVDV1a NADL vaccine. The CP strain, BVDV2-125C, had an insertion in the genome with sequences from the vaccine virus.

The PI BVDV animals shedding virus may render the contact cattle more susceptible to bacterial infections [12] as BVDV is immunosuppressive with reduced lymphocyte, neutrophil, and macrophage functions [1] . Pneumonia may also be found in PI BVDV calves at necropsy [23, 26] . In a study of PI calves from a single herd moved to a feedlot and observed over time, 25% of the PI calves had gross pneumonic lesions at necropsy, with no or only mild MD lesions [23] . McClurkin et al. [5] also reported that when PI calves were exposed to M. haemolytica by aerosol, one of four calves died of acute pasteurellosis within three days, and the other three calves became febrile with eventual recovery and increasing M. haemolytica antibody titers.
