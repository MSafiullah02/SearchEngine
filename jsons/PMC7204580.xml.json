Spreading to 25 countries in less than 2 months, the virus has now affected more than 109,000 people and caused more than 3,800 deaths in 105 countries.2 The current situation resembles what the world encountered in the last decade with other unknown viruses\u2014the 2009\u20132010 swine flu (H1N1), the 2014 West African Ebola virus disease (EVD), the 2018\u20132020 Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) EVD, and the 2015\u20132016 Zika virus outbreak in Latin America. How does the governments\u2019 and the international community\u2019s response to the COVID-19 contrast that to the 2014 West African Ebola virus epidemic?",

Preliminary investigation suggests a zoonotic origin3; there is a lack of knowledge about the epidemiology of the virus4; and there is widespread misinformation, generating panic and mistrust among the public. Estimates put the fatality rate of COVID-19 at less than 3% and its basic reproduction number (R0) between 2 and 3,5 compared with the high fatality rate of the 2014 EVD, typically estimated to be around 50\u201370%, and an R0 of a similar range.6 Whereas economic impacts of the 2014 EVD were estimated at $25.2 billion,7 a recent assessment on COVID-19 suggests that the disease could cost the global economy $1.1 trillion in lost income.8 Because of the forced quarantine of Hubei Province, there is a common understanding that the economic costs will be considerable, as businesses, schools, and factories have been closed for weeks. As China is the second largest global economy, with 19% of share (GDP: $13.4 trillion),9 the costs will be likely larger than that of the last health epidemic in the country (the 2002\u20132003 severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]), which costed the global economy $40 billion.10 Because of the integrated international supply chain, several countries are facing a slowdown, and prices for metals, oil, or other materials have also fallen on expectations of lower demand. Even the technology sector and the global fashion industry are feeling the impacts.",

Data on the genome were deposited in a public repository, providing researchers with the opportunity to develop diagnostic tests, treatments, or vaccines. The international community also reacted quickly. The WHO declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020. The Trump administration unprecedentedly barred entry to Chinese nationals who had been in China in the previous 14 days. The United States, along with several other countries, imposed entry screenings at airports, and British Airways even suspended flights. More than 20 countries organized prompt evacuation of their nationals. International agencies are shipping supplies. Although media coverage has been massive since the first month,11 both the Chinese government and the international community are taking further steps to curb misinformation. The WHO very recently announced that a vaccine could be available in 18 months.",

There was an attempt to control the flow of information and censor doctors\u2019 announcements of the true number of cases. It took nearly 2 weeks of requests from the WHO to have a team of medical experts travel to China to assist in investigating the virus. Despite this initial public health cover-up, its response represents a remarkable progress compared with how it handled the 2002\u20132003 SARS pandemic.14 If anything, the actions taken, together with the openness in reporting about COVID-19, are buying the rest of the world some precious time. On the one hand, better preparedness through strengthening of the public health system\u2014for example, the China CDC after the 2002\u20132003 SARS epidemic\u2014is helping the Chinese government respond to this novel virus in a timely way. On the other hand, however, global economic and geopolitical interests and the role of the Chinese economy worldwide might contribute to why the international community\u2019s attention and response stand out when compared with the 2014 EVD, or even with the 2018\u20132020 DRC EVD.",
