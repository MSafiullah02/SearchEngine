            "text": "Despite its widespread use and applicability in treating all stages of cancer, i.e. from front-line therapies to palliation, the efficacy of chemotherapy remains suboptimal. One of the main reasons for the underwhelming success of chemotherapy is the resistant phenotype, which may be inherent to cancerous tissue or arise following drug administration (1\u20136). Resistance arises by virtue of the adaptability of cancer cells to a variable local environment (7\u201311). One of the types of adaptation is a network of often synergistic pathways that negate the efficacy of anticancer drugs (12, 13). These resistance pathways can range from individual factors through to the 3D tissue organization and impact on drug efficacy by alterations to drug distribution within solid tumors, affecting cellular uptake, increasing intracellular metabolism/excretion, specific mutations within target molecules, evasion of repair mechanisms, and dampening of pathways aimed at initiating cell death. Resistance mechanisms can be initiated by host factors such as high cell density, hypoxia, or stress response pathways.",

Expression of these proteins at the plasma membrane reduces intracellular drug concentration and is therefore a first line of cellular defense. The mechanism of resistance is a generic one owing to the ability of efflux pumps to transport an extraordinary number and range of chemicals (17\u201319). For example, the multidrug efflux pump ABCB1 is known to interact with over 200 compounds. The broad multispecificity of these transporters is a hallmark of their origin as environmental xenobiotic protection pathways. ABCB1 is normally expressed in a number of healthy tissues, particularly those involved in secretory roles (e.g. liver and GI tract) or in a barrier capacity (e.g. blood\u2013brain and blood\u2013testes) (20\u201323). Expression of ABCB1 in these tissues is regulated by endogenous transcription factors such as the nuclear orphan receptor family (24). However, cancers arising from these tissues frequently display inherent resistance, which is present prior to chemotherapy exposure. Consequently, overexpression of ABCB1 in cancer cells following exposure to chemotherapy agents is thought to be achieved by virtue of stress response pathways rather than a classical induction process (24).",

In addition, expression of ABCB1 has been cataloged in a large number of human cancer types including several leukemia types and solid tumors from the breast, colon, and adrenal tissues (25\u201328). A link between expression and a resistant phenotype is well established in acute myelogenous (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and acute lymphoblastic (ALL) leukemias (29, 30). However, the role of ABCB1, and other multidrug efflux pumps, in conferring resistance in many solid tumors continues to be vigorously debated (4, 15, 31, 32). The inability to unequivocally quantify the role of ABCB1 in clinical drug resistance has arisen for a number of reasons including: (1) variability in the methods used to detect ABCB1 expression, (2) the presence of other, often synergistic resistance pathways, (3) the poor inhibition of its activity in vivo, (4) poor study design, and (5) variability of ABCB1 expression patterns in tumors. A comprehensive understanding of resistance pathways in the clinical setting is therefore required to confidently assign the relative contributions of specific resistance factors.",

Unfortunately, the use of verapamil was doomed owing to its poor potency to inhibit ABCB1, whereas its effects on calcium channels (particularly in cardiac tissue) occurred at low plasma concentrations. Similar effects were reported with a number of other ABCB1 \u201cinhibitors\u201d that were already in clinical usage for various unrelated settings (41\u201344). These compounds inhibited ABCB1 primarily by acting as substrates that could compete for transport by the protein. Unfortunately, drugs belonging to this class of ABCB1 inhibitor were united in displaying poor potency of action, which directly resulted in unacceptable levels of systemic toxicity (45\u201347). Subsequent generations of ABCB1 inhibitors (Fig. 18.1) have been explored using chemical modification of the first generation agents, combinatorial chemistry to identify new chemical moieties, and, more recently, the use of natural products to uncover novel lead compounds (48\u201356).\n",

This does, however, seem rather premature given the small number of compounds that have been subjected to exhaustive characterization. In addition, the power of combinatorial chemistry has not been fully exploited and the newest generation of compounds (from natural sources) not yet fully characterized, although there have been suggestions that inhibitor development is redundant because of the recent emergence of novel nongenotoxic anticancer agents that are directed against specific cellular targets rather than the more generic proliferation process. However, the majority of these compounds are cytostatic and many of these novel cytostatic anticancer drugs are themselves subjected to efflux by transporters such as ABCB1 (25, 63, 64). Consequently, the role of genotoxic drugs in cancer treatment in the near future should not be dismissed. Thus the problem of ABCB1 mediated transport appears to be a phenomenon that must be dealt with and the desirability of a clinically useable and efficacious inhibitor remains high in oncological circles.",

The elegantly simple Lock-and-Key model postulated that the enzyme contained a rigid binding pocket that interacted with a specific ligand and allowed subsequent release of the enzymatic product. Although this model has been refined over the intervening decades, classic Lock-and-Key type ligand interactions cannot account for the broad multispecificity exhibited by tranporters such as ABCB1. Currently, there are three general models that address multispecific ligand interactions. The first, proposes that the binding pocket, although still an essentially rigid region, contains different interaction sites that allow a range of structurally distinct ligands to bind (67). The second model, based on Koshland\u2019s Induced-Fit model (68), proposes that conformational flexibility within the protein allows the binding pocket to reconfigure and accommodate structurally diverse ligands. The third and most recent model is based on the the observation that a single ligand may bind to a protein in multiple and different orientations (69). The Differential Ligand Positioning model proposes that a single ligand might be able to interact with a number of spatially distinct regions of the binding site thus allowing multiple ligand molecules to bind simulatenously.",

            "text": "Although the precise mechanism(s) employed by ABCB1 to interact with ligands has not been elucidated the last three decades of biochemistry have provided significant insight. The multipilicity of ABCB1 drug ligand binding sites was first shown by Tamai and Safa (70) and, to date, there are at least four known distinct drug binding sites (71\u201377). Biochemical studies have established that the drug binding sites show a range of different behaviors with noncompetitive inhibition for certain substrates, indicative of overlapping substrate specificities; competitive inhibition for other drug ligands, such as vinblastine and doxorubicin; and cooperative allostery between certain substrates, e.g. ATP, vinblastine and verapamil (73, 78\u201381). In addition there appear to be multiple binding sites on individual transmembrane segments that have the ability to simultaneously bind distinct drugs or multiple molecules of the same drug (71, 82\u201384). As a consequence, it is likely that the TM segments that contribute to the drug-binding pocket have a high degree of conformational mobility to allow drug molecules to form the required binding sites and to allow for diffe\u00adrent orientations of drug molecules within the binding pocket. Thus, it is likely that ABCB1 employs a combination of the general multispecific interaction models described above, thereby maximizing the range of ligands with which it can interact. However, this mobility and flexibility in substrate binding creates unique challenges for inhibitor design.",

Structure\u2013activity relationships (SAR) have exploited three decades of pharmacological studies on ABCB1 in an attempt to correlate substrate activity with specific molecular descriptors. However, interpreting the large volume of data collected on ABCB1 is highly complex due to a number of intrinsic issues. These stem from largely technical issues including the use of different assays, parameters reported (e.g. IC50, KD, KM & KI), drug solubilities, and variable drug partition coefficients. Despite this, some general features of ABCB1 substrates that were first noted remain relevant in that they tend to be lipophilic and amphiphilic, have a large molecular volume, contain electronegative and hydrogen bonding groups, and occasionally a weakly cationic group. More detailed molecular descriptors have since been revealed by a number of different approaches (for detailed reviews see (86\u201388)).",

In addition, the transported substrates acted primarily as hydrogen-donors rather than acceptors. A study by Seeling examined the structure of a hundred chemically diverse compounds and sought to more clearly define the number of electron donor groups and their fixed spatial distance (95). Seelig\u2019s analysis proposed a general pattern for ABCB1 substrate recognition comprising two or three electron-donor (or hydrogen-bonding acceptor) groups with a fixed spatial separation of 2.5 \u00b1 0.3 \u00c5 (as a type-I pattern) or 4.6 \u00b1 0.6 \u00c5 (as a type-II pattern), respectively.

Quantitative models such as 3D-QSAR can be applied to de novo computational screening to lead the synthesis of higher potency lead compounds. In combination with in vitro testing and analysis, for refinement of the quantitative model, this technique has been used in the design of improved inhibitors and higher affinity ligands (103). Activity predictions by 3D-QSAR models require that the ligands be accurately aligned and, consequently, this limits their application in automated chemical compound database screening. Although 2D-QSAR models can be used for database screening, they lack highly useful 3D information crucial for subsequent drug design.",

However, unfavorable pharmacokinetic interactions led to elevated drug plasma levels and reduced systemic clearance of anticancer drugs, producing significant toxicity in patients (61, 106\u2013108). This necessitated a reduction in the administered dose of chemotherapeutic drugs, which in turn reduced the overall efficacy of anticancer drug treatment. Concomitant inhibition of ABCB1 and cytochrome P450-3A isoform (CYP3A), which is responsible for the metabolism of almost 50% of all clinically employed drugs by the second generation inhibitors, resulted in higher and prolonged plasma levels of anticancer drugs because of impaired metabolism and elimination. It was subsequently determined that ABCB1 and CYP3A have a considerable overlap in substrate specificities and this highlighted one of the limitations of drug design methodologies, namely, the inability to predict undesirable pharmacokinetic interactions (109, 110). Consequently, although 3D-QSAR strategies led to an improvement of first generation compounds, the second generation compounds ultimately failed to provide an ideal route to ABCB1 inhibition without compromising anticancer drug efficacy. Thus, it was necessary to approach inhibitor development from a broader chemical space approach such as pharmacophore modeling.",

The pharmacophore is a description of the molecular framework which contains the essential features responsible for a drug\u2019s biological activity. With the benefit of nearly a century\u2019s additional knowledge, the underlying concept has been expanded to include our understanding of three dimensional substrate structures and the arrangement of their essential molecular features. In current terminology, the pharmacophore is a representation of the spatial arrangement of structural features required for biological activity. The determination of a pharmacophore requires knowledge of (1) the three dimensional structure and bioactive conformation of molecules, (2) key atomic features, and (3) the determination of the relationship between those features and biological activity. Once developed, pharmacophoric models can be highly valuable tools to provide insight into drug molecule interactions and aid in the design of higher potency inhibitors.",

            "text": "Seelig\u2019s SAR data (95) was suggestive of a fairly simple pharmacophoric distinction between substrates and inhibitors of ABCB1, whereas the spatial requirements would be indicative of discrete binding sites. SAR data can be analyzed and interpreted for small numbers of compounds (<500), but as datasets grow in size and complexity computational approaches are better suited to generating pharmacophore models. There are a range of programs that are widely used for pharmacophore generation including ALADDIN, COMPASS, SCAMPI, PARM, and DANTE (112); however, the most commonly used are DISCO (113), GASP (114), and Catalyst/HIPHOP (115). These software packages utilize different algorithms to determine a common set of molecular features on the basis of comparisons of interacting compounds (substrates or inhibitors). A consequence of this is that most of the pharmacophore models generated are based on the alignment of a small number (i.e. the training set) of energy minimized conformations of known substrates. However, this means that the dynamic nature of biologically active substrates cannot be fully predicted. One program, Catalyst/HypoGen, employs a combination of QSAR and pharmacophore methods (116). This requires a wide range of interacting and noninteracting compounds combined with experimentally determined activity data, which provides a more robust pharmacophore. The Catalyst/HypoGen pharmacophore is capable of predicting the potential capacity for a query compound to interact, as in a traditional pharmacophore model. However, it can also estimate its potential activity based on a regression of the training dataset, as with the 3D-QSAR model. Many pharmacophore models reported in current literature claim to be reasonably accurate at predicting ABCB1 substrates. Ekins and coworkers generated pharmacophore-QSAR models to rank ABCB1 inhibitors on the basis of modulating substrate transport (117). A single substrate pharmacophore was produced by overlaying verapamil and digoxin based structures, followed by fitting vinblastine, and the generated pharmacophore revealed multiple hydrophobic and hydrogen-bond acceptor features as important characteristics of ABCB1 substrates. An ensemble model of 100 pharmacophores was generated by Penzotti and coworkers and consisted of a set of 2, 3, and 4-point pharmacophores for discrimination between interacting and noninteracting ABCB1 compounds with potential ABCB1 ligands required to match at least 20% of the pharmacophores in the ensemble (118). Screening of ligands, also referred to as virtual screening, is a data mining approach that applies the pharmacophoric model to screen commercial chemical compound databases to identify molecules that can potentially interact with the protein. Potential compounds can then be purchased and directly tested using in vitro assays. Consequently, this approach has become a frequently used strategy for the identification of novel lead ligands. Several ABCB1 pharmacophores have been used in screening databases. Rebizter and coworkers used a propafenone based pharmacophore model to screen the Derwent World Drug Index (119). This identified 19 new potential ABCB1 substrates but the study did not report subsequent experimental verification (120). More recently, a pharmacophore model generated from 131 propafenone ABCB1 inhibitors was used to screen the SPECS database (134,000 compounds) and successfully identified two lead compounds with submicromolar range affinities (121). Despite these promising leads, none of these compounds have yet made the transition from the laboratory to the clinic.",

            "text": "Combinatorial chemistry was responsible for the a priori development of the third generation of ABCB1 inhibitors generated with the objective of improving potency without unwanted pharmacokinetic interactions. Four promising lead compounds (Elacridar (50), Zosuquidar (131), Tariquidar (54), and Ontogen (52)) were developed by high throughput screening approaches using SAR analyzes. Their nanomolar potency and efficacy in experimental systems (in vitro and in vivo) led to a rapid progression to clinical trials. Tariquidar garnered the greatest interest because of its high potency (100\u20131,000-fold greater than the previous generation inhibitors), its discrimination between ABCB1 and ABCC1, and its long effective duration (35, 132, 133). However, despite its success in phase I and II clinical trials, phase III trials were suspended due to unfavorable toxicity reports in the treatments of lung carcinoma and the future of this inhibitor is currently unclear. Clinical trials for other third generation ABCB1 inhibitors are proceeding and although the initial reports are promising, with minimal adverse pharmacokinetic interactions reported, these trials are still at relatively early stages with small patient sample sizes and no unambiguous reports on improvements in anticancer drug efficacy (134\u2013137). Although the pharmaceutical armory is small, there remains a paucity of extensive inhibitor characterization in the clinical setting. More attention should be devoted to trials with large patient populations and a broad range of cancer types, with detailed information on the class of resistance and greater use of surrogate assays.",

Some naturally occurring flavonoids and their hydrophobic derivatives (e.g. aurones) have been observed to inhibit the transport function of ABCB1 by interaction with NBD 2 and the cytosolic regions of the protein. It has been shown that although some flavonoids can inhibit the labeling of ABCB1 with their photoactive substrates (145\u2013147), indicating that they may bind directly to the substrate binding site, others bind directly to the purified recombinant C-terminal nucleotide-binding domain from mouse ABCB1 (NBD2). Moreover, it appears that the binding domain may overlap the ATP binding site and vicinal steroid binding site (142). However, flavonoids are also potent inhibitors of drug metabolizing enzymes (148, 149) and pharmacokinetic interactions with anticancer drugs are likely to prevent a clinical application in their current form.",

Unfortunately, the majority of these inhibitors have also been reported to have caused undesirable pharmacokinetic anticancer drug interactions thus limiting their clinical application. Rapid technological advancements have made automated and semiautomated in silico approaches, such as pharmacophore and QSAR modelling, feasible for screening vast compound databases and developing higher potency inhibitors. However, despite the identification of a number of potential lead compounds these approaches have not yet led to the production of compounds for clinical trials. Because of these obstacles to ABCB1 inhibition some recent studies have returned to screening herbal and fruit extracts for lead compounds. These approaches are reminiscent of the first generation inhibitor screening methods of broadly sampling the existing chemical space in an attempt to identify lead compounds. A more rational approach may be the utilization of protein structure modelling exploiting high resolution homologous template structures. By developing models of protein interaction with potential ligands, in combination with complementary physicochemical (QSAR) and pharmacophoric descriptors this may offer a different platform for the design of potential lead inhibitors.",

The enzyme cleaves sialic acid residues on a surface receptor involved in anchoring newly formed influenza viral particles, thereby facilitating virus release from infected cells. Several high resolution crystal structures of neuraminidase have been solved, but of particular significance were those structures containing bound sialic acid substrate (151\u2013153). This provided critical insight into specific residues that interact with sialic acid at the enzyme active site. A combination of computational chemistry and examination of the crystal structures of neuraminidase revealed that the C-4 hydroxyl group of sialic acid provided a significant contact point between the substrate and the protein (154). Substitution of the C-4 hydroxyl group with a larger, basic guanidinyl group gave rise to 4-deoxy-4-guanidino-Neu5Ac2en (commonly referred to as Zanamivir or Relenza), which displayed antiviral activity (155). Moreover, structural (156) and molecular modelling (157) data of the complex demonstrated that Zanamivir bound directly at the active site of neuraminidase. Subsequent clinical trials demonstrated that Zanamivir is clinically effective for the treatment and prevention of influenza (158, 159).",

            "text": "To date EM has provided the only direct structural information on ABCB1. In constrast several high resolution crystal structures of prokaryotic ABC transporters have been solved in recent years (65, 168\u2013172). These structures in conjuction with the parameters obtained from EM studies have been avidly used to produce homology models of ABCB1 (173\u2013177). Homology models provide an invaluable starting point for the interpretation of biochemical data in the absence of high resolution structures (130, 173). The quality and accuracy of a model is entirely dependent on the resolution of the template crystal structure and the template-sample sequence alignment. As a consequence, protein homology models are viewed as approximations of protein structures, comparable to medium resolution images and not suitable for use in structure-informed drug design. Furthermore, the reliability of ABCB1 homology models was recently confounded by the withdrawal of three MsbA structures. In addition, the only available structure for an ABC multidrug efflux pump, namely Sav1866, revealed an unexpected domain organization (65). This called for the refinement and reinterpretation of all previous ABCB1 models (65, 177\u2013179). Despite this, the quality of subsequent models has been improved owing to the higher resolution of the Sav1866 structure (\u223c3 \u00c5) and better sequence alignment with ABCB1 (56% and 52.8% for transmembrane domains 1 and 2 of Sav1866 and ABCB1, respectively) (175). Furthermore, cross-linking data suggest that the unusual \u201cdomain swapping\u201d architecture of Sav1866 is also adopted by ABCB1 (180). The crystal structure of Sav1866, therefore, appears to provide a more reliable template for the computational modelling of ABCB1.",

In contrast, the nucleotide free configuration has hydrophilic residues shifted to the interhelical regions with the hydrophobic residues being exposed to the translocation pore (175).

However, the specific conformational transitions have yet to be shown experimentally.

            "text": "Locating the drug binding site(s) in ABCB1 is complicated by its promiscuity and the complexity of the drug\u2013protein interactions. For example, (1) how many sites are there, (2) are they located at distinct regions or within a single large domain, and (3) can drugs bind to more than one site? One technique that has proven invaluable in the quest to uncover the drug binding sites is cysteine-scanning mutagenesis. This technique requires a cysteine-less protein template, and fortuitously, ABCB1 is fully functional in the absence of cysteine (184). The substitution of residues at specific positions in ABCB1 with cysteine was used to determine the residues that are critical for protein function and drug binding. Using an array of ABCB1 single-cysteine mutants and thiol-reactive substrates, (e.g. MTS-verapamil and dibromobimane), Loo and Clarke outlined a potential drug binding domain within ABCB1 (83, 185\u2013190). The investigations suggested that TM helices 4\u20136 of TMD1 and 9\u201312 of TMD2 contributed residues to a drug binding pocket in ABCB1 (Fig. 18.2). This was in agreement with earlier findings, using photoaffinity labeling, which indicated that the N- and C-terminal ends of the TMDs are involved in drug binding (82, 181, 183). In addition, certain residues (e.g. residue Ser222) are within the binding site of more than one unrelated substrate, suggesting a degree of redundancy between regions of interaction. These combined studies provided the field with valuable information about the drug binding regions and the substrate-induced conformational changes. However, the highly reactive nature of the thiol-labeling compounds used, the complexities of the substrate\u2013ABCB1 interaction, and the conformational flexibility of the protein make it difficult to distinguish between binding to the \u201ctrue\u201d sites from binding at intermediate stages of the translocation pathway.\n",

Globisch and coworkers used 3D structural information along with SiteID and Site Finder programs in an attempt to pinpoint binding regions and pockets (173). The programs located three binding regions and a central binding cavity. A number of residues in the vicinity of the predicted binding regions have previously been identified to contribute to the binding domain of propafenone and its chemical derivatives. Unfortunately, the binding sites identified are large, dispersed regions rather than distinct \u201csites\u201d within ABCB1, thereby precluding any realistic attempts at drug-docking.",

Furthermore, an alternative substrate would induce a different conformational change creating a binding pocket specific for that substrate but within the same binding region. The model was supported by the fact that the TMs are quite flexible at 37 \u00b0C (from cross-linking data) and it was suggested that substrate binding reduces the flexibility of the TMs, therefore ensuring localisation of specific residues to the binding pocket(s) (193, 194).

            "text": "The previous experiments suggested that there is one generic site in ABCB1 that accommodates many different compounds. However, a series of experiments, carried out by Dey and coworkers, demonstrated that the ABCB1 inhibitor cis-(Z)-flupentixol binds to a site distinct from the substrate binding domain, thereby preventing translocation and promoting substrate dissociation (195). Furthermore, conformational changes generated by flupentixol binding to ABCB1, as demonstrated by altered susceptibility to proteolytic digestion and UIC2 antibody binding, are distinct from that induced by ABCB1 substrates or competitive modulators (195\u2013197). cis-(Z)-flupentixol does not interact with ABCB1 substrates in a classical competitive manner. Given that it binds at a distinct site, the interaction with the substrates is defined as an allosteric one. Earlier radioligand binding studies also identified a site that bound nontransported modulators of ABCB1 (Nicardipine and GF120918), which was distinct from the [3H]-vinblastine interaction site (73). Similarly, studies on Hoechst33342 transport also identified a potential modulator specific site that recognizes prazosin and progesterone (198). The discovery of a potentially less promiscuous, allosteric modulator site(s) in ABCB1 may provide an alternative and possibly less complicated avenue along which structure-based inhibitor design may proceed.",
