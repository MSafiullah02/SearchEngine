The hypothesis was bolstered by the discovery of catalytic RNA (Kruger et al. 1982; Guerrier-Takada et al. 1983), building on the earlier discovery that RNA is the genetic material in some viruses (Fraenkel-Conrat 1956; Gierer and Schramm 1956) and in plant viroids (Diener 1971), the latter possessing catalytic RNA but not protein (Flores et al. 2004). The theory has been extensively developed and has gained much support (White 1976; Benner, Ellington, and Tauer 1989; Jeffares, Poole, and Penny 1998; Joyce and Orgel 1999; Yarus 2002); nevertheless, there are many unresolved issues. One such issue, and the subject of this article, is the timing and nature of the evolutionary transition from RNA to DNA.",

At one end of the spectrum is the proposal that DNA evolved before protein (Benner, Ellington, and Tauer 1989), possibly even before RNA (Dworkin, Lazcano, and Miller 2003)\u2014see legend to figure 1. While feasible, there are no indications from extant organisms that DNA took on a biological role at such an early stage (Poole, Logan, and Sj\u00f6berg 2002), and we shall not discuss this further.\n",

Consistent with this, a recent attempt to reconstruct the conserved core of LUCA identified only four universal components of modern DNA replication and repair (DnaN: the sliding clamp; HolB: the clamp loader; PolI-A: the 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease subunit of DNA PolI; and RecA: involved in recombination repair). Three produced trees congruent with 16\u201318S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) trees, while HolB was argued to have been subject to horizontal gene transfer (Harris et al. 2003).",

To clarify, if DNA was the genetic material in LUCA, it seems likely that one of the two forms of replication apparatus (either bacterial or archaeal/eukaryotic) was present at this stage, with the other form representing a lineage-specific replacement (nonorthologous gene displacement [NOGD]). At the same time, LUCA must have carried out ribonucleotide reduction. Alternatively, LUCA possessed an RNA genome, and DNA replication evolved twice independently (Leipe, Aravind, and Koonin 1999; Forterre 2002).",

However, while a single evolutionary origin for the catalytic subunit of the ribonucleotide reductases is established, its evolutionary history is obscured (Poole, Logan, and Sj\u00f6berg 2002). There are several reasons for this. First, the phylogenetic distribution of the paralogous catalytic subunits from the three classes is incomplete. Bacteria as a domain possess all three classes, archaea largely possess class II and III reductases, and eukaryotes thus far possess only class I reductases. Secondly, the reductases may have undergone horizontal gene transfer as well as polyphyletic losses (Torrents et al. 2002). While the three classes perform the same reaction, they do so under different oxygenic conditions: class I is strictly aerobic, class II is operational in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and class III is strictly anaerobic. Consequently, many organisms possess more than one class, and gain and loss of reductases may be a cause/consequence of changes in habitat. Third, sequence similarity is extremely low between the classes (Tauer and Benner 1997; Torrents et al. 2002), making it unlikely that meaningful phylogenetic analyses can be carried out for the entire data set. These points, taken together, make it difficult to establish the timing of their emergence (i.e., pre- or post-LUCA).",

While RNA virus genomes are probably under selection to be small (Crotty and Andino 2002), a genome of 30 kb causes problems both for the RNA world and for an RNA-based LUCA. Partial reconstructions of the late stages of the RNP world (Jeffares, Poole, and Penny 1998; Yarus 2002) appear to overstep this limit, and conservation of the ribosomal protein superoperon between archaea and bacteria has been interpreted as evidence for genomes in excess of 30 kb in LUCA (Leipe, Aravind, and Koonin 1999).",

There are two forms of bona fide RNA repair now known. One is repair of methyl damage, conserved between eukaryotes and bacteria (Aas et al. 2003; Ougland et al. 2004) (Appendix 1). The second form involves proofreading and repair by RNA polymerases, analogous to that observed with DNA polymerases, and is conserved across all three domains of life (table 1). We argue from structural and functional data that the second of these, RNA polymerase-dependent proofreading and repair, is likely to have been a feature of LUCA rather than a recent innovation as part of selection for improved messenger RNA (mRNA) quality control, though this is no doubt the current function of this phenomenon. We will briefly summarize the experimental evidence for RNA repair by RNA polymerases, then consider the implications for the RNA to DNA transition and the nature of the genome of LUCA.\n",

How the cell checks that an mRNA is correctly synthesized and deals with incorrectly copied RNAs is a subject of intense investigation, falling under the broad term of quality control. In both eukaryotes and bacteria, there are mechanisms for eliminating transcripts that fail to pass quality control (Gillet and Felden 2001; Wilusz, Wang, and Peltz 2001; Vasudevan, Peltz, and Wilusz 2002). The general expectation has been that, following recognition of a damaged or incorrectly synthesized mRNA, the damaged molecule would be destroyed rather than repaired; repair would not pay its way, since thousands of RNAs are produced in the cell, and therefore the best way to deal with the odd damaged RNA is to break it down and start afresh.",

The average length of proteins in prokaryotes is between 300\u2013400 amino acids (aa) (Skovgaard et al. 2001), equating to transcripts somewhere in excess of 1 kb. The genome of Escherichia coli K-12 (Blattner et al. 1997) revealed the longest open reading frame to code for a 2,383 aa protein. The corresponding transcript should be over 7,200 nucleotides. With errors on the order of every 10,000 bases, RNA polymerases would make one error in every 10 transcripts in bacteria, and for the largest E. coli ORF errors might turn up in 2 of 3 transcripts. The human genome encodes a muscle protein called titin that, at 26,926 aa, is the largest protein known (Labeit and Kolmerer 1995). At around 80 kb just for the coding region (i.e., minus introns), it would be expected to pick up around eight errors per mRNA during transcription. Even considering code redundancy, a lot of mRNAs would be expected to possess coding errors, and the known pathways of mRNA surveillance only deal with transcripts with premature termination signals (nonsense-mediated decay; Wilusz, Wang, and Peltz [2001]) or transcripts lacking a stop codon (nonstop decay; Vasudevan, Peltz, and Wilusz [2002]). Without some form of proofreading and repair, the number of mRNAs carrying coding errors could be significant.",

This enables RNA polymerases to negotiate barriers to elongation. Briefly, it seems that upon arrest of the RNA polymerase at some barrier to elongation, the cleavage-stimulatory factors interact with the polymerase, causing it to backtrack and hydrolyze the nascent transcript. Elongation is then reinitiated.",

Upon misincorporation of a nucleotide in the growing RNA, the addition of the next nucleotide is slowed, with extension occurring between 5- and 20-fold slower than for a correct incorporation. This delay provides time for the cleavage-stimulatory factor, transcription factor IIS (TFIIS) to bind arrested pol II, stimulating removal of the mismatched nucleotide via the intrinsic PolII 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease activity (Wind and Reines 2000).

Recently, several important papers shed further light on this process. Shaevitz et al. (2003) presented an optical trapping study of the RNA polymerase (RNAP) from E. coli, showing backtracking and recovery from pausing by single molecules of RNAP. Pausing was significantly reduced by growth regulator A (GreA) or growth regulator B (GreB)-induced cleavage. Sosunov et al. (2003) demonstrated by an elegant exploitation of the intrinsic exonuclease activity of E. coli RNAP, combined with mutagenesis and modeling, that a common two-metal mechanism is used for both elongation and repair (fig. 2), in a manner similar to that proposed for the 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease activity of DNA polymerases (Joyce and Steitz 1994). Two further papers showed surprising similarities in the roles of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic transcription factors in stimulation of the endonuclease activity (fig. 3a\u2013d). In a medium-resolution (3.8 \u00c5) study of the binding of TFIIS to yeast pol II (Kettenberger, Armache, and Cramer 2003, 2004), the highly extended TFIIS is seen to insert its \u03b2-ribbon domain III via a pore into the active site. Two acidic residues at the tip of a loop in domain III are presented to the active site adjacent to the tightly bound metal ion involved in elongation (fig. 3, panels b and d). In a parallel study using electron microscopy (EM) at 15 \u00c5 resolution (Opalka et al. 2003), the prokaryotic elongation factor GreB was bound to E. coli RNAP. GreB inserts a completely \u03b1-helical domain into the RNAP active site. Despite having no structural homology whatsoever to TFIIS, it nevertheless also appears to present two completely conserved acidic residues to the active site near the metal ion (fig. 3, panels a and c). In both cases, the acidic residues are proposed to position a second metal ion and water molecule for hydrolytic RNA cleavage (fig. 2) as proposed by Sosunov et al. (2003). However, the resolution of the EM study did not allow the acidic residues to be accurately placed in the active site. Sosunova et al. (2003) nicely complemented this work using mutation, crosslinking, and modeling, locating the acidic residues unambiguously in the active site and confirming that GreB does not work allosterically but by direct recruitment of a metal ion.\n",

Consistent with placement in LUCA, the two largest subunits of RNA polymerase (\u03b2 and \u03b2\u2032) are routinely used as markers in phylogenetic reconstructions. There is no evidence for extensive, domain-level horizontal transfer, and the resulting trees are congruent with trees constructed using rRNA (Tourasse and Gouy 1999) (while establishing the correct topology is nontrivial, see Tourasse and Gouy [1999], topology does not affect the conclusion that these two subunits can be traced back to the LUCA). Furthermore, Harris et al. (2003) report that the \u03b1 subunit also produces a tree congruent with rRNA and can thus be placed in the LUCA on phylogenetic grounds, consistent with results from other authors (Koonin 2003).",

However, this ultimate origin should be taken to represent a probable earlier intermediate stage; on evidence, LUCA would have possessed an RNA polymerase resembling a modern multisubunit RNA polymerase. That the capacity for repair appears to be a consequence of the common two-metal mechanism for elongation implies that, at the very least, the RNA polymerase in LUCA possessed the capacity for repair.

However, in answering the question above, several points should be borne in mind. Firstly, the argument for genomic RNA repair in LUCA is complicated, and perhaps weakened, by the difficulty in establishing whether or not DNA was present. Secondly, this thesis extrapolates a modern function in mRNA quality control by polymerases reading off DNA templates to an ancestral function in genome replication by polymerases reading off RNA templates. The third is somewhat dependent on the first; assuming RNA repair was present, was it involved in quality control, genome replication, or both?",

However, it is worth noting that even if a viral origin were unequivocally demonstrated, it is not possible to establish the timing of the origin of cellular DNA replication. DNA virus-derived DNA replication could have been co-opted concurrent with or prior to LUCA, with this original apparatus being displaced by another viral apparatus in one lineage after divergence of bacteria from archaea/eukaryotes.

Upon evolution of ribonucleotide reduction, the simplest explanation in terms of their use in replication of genetic material is that the incumbent polymerase incorporated deoxyribonucleotide precursors. Substrate and template selectivity, where studied, appears to be easily altered\u2014single residues are responsible for substrate selectivity in E. coli DNA pol I (Astatke et al. 1998) and reverse transcriptase (Gao et al. 1997), and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from Brome Mosaic Virus will accept both DNA and RNA-DNA hybrid templates (Siegel et al. 1999). If, as per Scenario 1 above, there had been only one NOGD from a viral source, one would expect an evolutionary relationship between modern multisubunit RNA polymerases and one family of replicative DNA polymerases. However, this is not the case. DNA polymerase III (C-family polymerases), the replicative polymerase in bacteria, is unrelated to modern archaeal- and eukaryotic-replicative DNA polymerases (which are B-family polymerases) and neither are related to multisubunit RNA polymerases (Ito and Braithwaite 1991; Steitz 1999; Cramer 2002b; Grabowski and Kelman 2003). In contrast, the palm domain of A-family DNA polymerases shows structural homology to the equivalent domains of several RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, reverse transcriptases, and DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (Hansen, Long, and Schultz 1997; Steitz 1999). This speaks in favor of a viral origin for deoxyribonucleotide syntheses in so far as it is possible to envisage deoxyribonucleotide \u201ctakeover\u201d in an RNA virus. These polymerases are nevertheless too far diverged to be useful for phylogenetic studies, and on sequence alone, it is not possible to show an evolutionary relationship between RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases (Zanotto et al. 1996). Furthermore, while the palm domains appear homologous, the finger and thumb domains are not (Hansen, Long, and Schultz 1997; Steitz 1999). The existence of a range of prereplicatively modified deoxyribonucleotides in DNA viruses does, however, provide a modern precedent for Forterre's hypothesis (examples being hydroxymethyluracil instead of T in SP01, U instead of T in PBS1 and PBS2, hydroxymethylcytosine instead of C in T-even phage, and 2-aminoadenine instead of A in cyanophage S-2L\u2014see Kornberg and Baker (1992).",

However, this seems highly unlikely. The convergent evolution of cleavage-stimulatory factors suggests that the intrinsic proofreading and repair capability of RNA polymerases was already in use with these factors emerging independently as evolutionary refinements of this process. Moreover, in an RNA-based system where there were strong limits on coding capacity, increases in replication fidelity would have been selectively advantageous. We therefore think it highly unlikely that this intrinsic capability of RNA polymerases was not co-opted at a very early stage. Indirectly supporting this contention, this capacity has been made use of several times in unrelated polymerases, including both single- and multisubunit RNA polymerases (Steitz 1999; Sosunov et al. 2003; table 1), as well as in DNA polymerases, including 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease activity of the Klenow fragment (Steitz 1999).

Over 30 years ago, Biebricher and Orgel (1973) published evidence that DNA-dependent RNA polymerase from E. coli was capable of accepting an RNA template, and more recent studies confirm this (Wettich and Biebricher 2001; Pelchat, Grenier, and Perreault 2002). While the RNA-replicating capacity of E. coli RNA polymerase is not physiological, such an example is known. In plants, RNA polymerase II is co-opted into replication of viroids (M\u00fchlbach and Sanger 1979; Schindler and M\u00fchlbach 1992; Fels, Hu, and Riesner 2001)\u2014pathogenic autonomously replicating single-stranded circular RNAs reaching approximately 400 bases in length (Flores et al. 2004).

In the absence of cleavage-stimulatory factors, proofreading and repair are reduced, and one may wonder whether it is mechanistically possible for an RNA polymerase to operate at higher fidelity than natural polymerases. In the case of DNA polymerases, it is clear that fidelity differs considerably between replicative and repair-specific polymerases (Beard and Wilson 2003), and DNA polymerase mutants with increased replication fidelity have been selected in mutagenesis screens (Fijalkowska, Dunn, and Schaaper 1993). To our knowledge, this has not been done for multisubunit RNA polymerases, but an example does exist for the single-subunit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from poliovirus. This mutant was selected for resistance to ribavirin, which acts as a mutagen, increasing the rate of mutation. The mutant high-fidelity polymerase emerged via a single-point mutation and exhibited an elevated fidelity in the absence of the drug (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard 2003). This is consistent with different fidelities observed for RNA polymerases from different viruses (see Pugachev et al. [2004] for a naturally occurring high-fidelity example). It thus seems reasonable to suggest that the current fidelity of RNA polymerases is a result of selection, resulting in a compromise between processivity and proofreading, and that higher fidelity RNA replication in LUCA could have been possible.",

A common evolutionary origin for this family of RNA polymerases is evident from both sequence and structural data (Cramer 2002a; Harris et al. 2003; Mirkin et al. 2003), making it relatively straightforward to argue that a polymerase resembling the modern conserved core was present in LUCA and has not been subject to extensive horizontal transfer (Tourasse and Gouy 1999; Harris et al. 2003).

Scenario 2: It has been suggested that deoxyribonucleotide synthesis could have originally occurred via a reverse of the deoxyriboaldolase reaction. In modern cells, deoxyribose-5-phosphate is broken down to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and acetaldehyde during salvage. The reverse reaction is energetically favorable and has been argued to be \u201ceasier\u201d to evolve than protein synthesis (Benner, Ellington, and Tauer 1989), although it is not a feature of modern metabolism. Scenario 3: In modern cells, deoxyribonucleotides are synthesized by ribonucleotide reductases, which are ubiquitous and share a common origin (as evidenced by structure and conservation of key catalytic residues), despite differing biochemistries. This has been taken to suggest that the LUCA possessed DNA (Pode, Penny, and Sj\u00f6berg 2000). Scenario 4: DNA replication seems to have evolved twice, as the bacterial apparatus shares no homology with the archaeal/eukaryotic apparatus.

Previous studies (Leipe, Aravind, and Koonin 1999; Forterre 2002) have pointed out that the DNA replication apparatus appears to have evolved twice, once in the bacterial lineage and once in the archaeal-eukaryote lineage. This implies that the LUCA possessed an RNA genome, and in this scenario, bacterial RNA polymerase-associated cleavage-stimulatory factors (GreA/GreB) and their archaeal/eukaryotic equivalents (TFS/TFIIS) were originally involved in proofreading and repair of the genome, as indicated by [Gen]. As discussed in the text, ribonucleotide reductases have a single origin, but may have been subject to horizontal gene transfer, so a common origin is not necessarily inconsistent with a DNA genome evolving twice independently. (b) LUCA was DNA based. In this scenario, one of the extant DNA replication machineries dates back to LUCA, while the other displaced the extant (LUCA) apparatus. In the figure, the archaeoeukaryotic apparatus is depicted as ancestral, but it is equally possible that the bacterial apparatus is ancestral. The source of a second replication apparatus is unclear but has been suggested to be viral in origin. Under a DNA-LUCA, the cleavage-stimulatory factors would have evolved twice independently in mRNA quality control [QC], which is their current function. A DNA-LUCA implies that ribonucleotide reductase was present in LUCA and that it this family of enzymes have subsequently been subject to horizontal gene transfer, thereby obscuring their early origin. Note also that the cleavage-stimulatory factors could have been subject to NOGD, mirroring the events depicted for the DNA replication apparatuses, though for simplicity, this is not shown. Note that, the scenario in panel (a) is reconcilable with two independent viral transfers but requires more events than either of the depicted scenarios. For completeness, the evolutionary relationship between eukaryote nuclear genes and counterparts in archaea and bacteria, the latter being of mitochondrial endosymbiotic origin (Esser et al. 2004), is displayed. However, the eukaryotic replication apparatus is related to the archaeal apparatus, not the bacterial, excepting universal components (see text).",
