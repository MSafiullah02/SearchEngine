The virus has since spread globally, resulting in the currently ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The first whole genome sequence was published on January 5 2020, and thousands of genomes have been sequenced since this date. This resource allows unprecedented insights into the past demography of SARS-CoV-2 but also monitoring of how the virus is adapting to its novel human host, providing information to direct drug and vaccine design. We curated a dataset of 7666 public genome assemblies and analysed the emergence of genomic diversity over time. Our results are in line with previous estimates and point to all sequences sharing a common ancestor towards the end of 2019, supporting this as the period when SARS-CoV-2 jumped into its human host. Due to extensive transmission, the genetic diversity of the virus in several countries recapitulates a large fraction of its worldwide genetic diversity. We identify regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that have remained largely invariant to date, and others that have already accumulated diversity. By focusing on mutations which have emerged independently multiple times (homoplasies), we identify 198 filtered recurrent mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Nearly 80% of the recurrent mutations produced non-synonymous changes at the protein level, suggesting possible ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2. Three sites in Orf1ab in the regions encoding Nsp6, Nsp11, Nsp13, and one in the Spike protein are characterised by a particularly large number of recurrent mutations (>15 events) which may signpost convergent evolution and are of particular interest in the context of adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to the human host. We additionally provide an interactive userfriendly web-application to query the alignment of the 7666 SARS-CoV-2 genomes.",

The initial evidence was suggestive of the outbreak being associated with a seafood market in Wuhan, which was closed on January 1 2020. The aetiological agent was characterised as a SARS-like betacoronavirus, later named SARS-CoV-2, and the first whole genome sequence (Wuhan-HU-1) was deposited on NCBI Genbank on January 5 2020 (1) . Human-to-human transmission was confirmed on January 14 2020, by which time SARS-CoV-2 had already spread to many countries throughout the world. Further extensive global transmission led to the WHO declaring COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11 2020.",

Additionally, whole-genome sequence data can inform drug and vaccine design.

For this analysis all ambiguous sites in the alignment were set to 'N'.

The main exception to this pattern is China, the source of the initial outbreak, where only a fraction of the global diversity is present (Figure 2d ). This is also to an extent the case for Italy (Figure S2b) , which was an early focus of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this global dataset includes only 35 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Italy, so some of the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 strains in circulation likely remains unsampled. The genomic diversity of the global SARS-CoV-2 population being recapitulated in multiple countries points to extensive worldwide transmission of COVID-19, likely from extremely early on in the pandemic.",

There is variation in genetic diversity across the alignment, with polymorphisms often found in neighbouring clusters ( Figure S5) . A simple permutation resampling approach suggests that both Orf3a and N exhibit SNPs which fall in the 95 th percentile of the empirical distribution (Table S3) . However, not all of these sites can be confirmed as true variant positions, due to the lack of accompanying sequence read data. However, we closely inspected those sites that appear to have arisen multiple times following a maximum parsimony tree building step. We identified a large number of putative homoplasies (n=1042 excluding masked regions), which were filtered to a high confidence cohort of 198 positions (see Methods).",

Orf1ab is an orthologous gene with other humanassociated betacoronaviruses, in particular SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV which both underwent host jumps into humans from likely bat reservoirs (23, 24) . We performed an equivalent analysis on human-associated virus assemblies available on the NCBI Virus platform. We identified six putative homoplasic sites within SARS-CoV-1, two occurring within the 3c-like proteinase just upstream of Nsp6 (10384, 10793) and a further two homoplasies within Orf1ab at Nsp9 and Nsp13 ( Figure S11 ).

It is of note that this genomic region coincides with the strongest homoplasy in SARS-CoV-2 which also occurs in the Nsp6 encoding region of Orf1ab. Codon 3606 of Orf1ab shares a leucine residue in MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, though a valine in SARS-CoV. The exact role of these and other homoplasic mutations in human associated betacoronaviruses represents an important area of future work, although it appears that the Orf1ab region may exhibit multiple putatively adapted variants across human betacoronavirus lineages.",

            "text": "One positive aspect of the current situation, relative to previous pandemics, is the unprecedented availability of scientific and technological means to face COVID-19. In particular, the rapid development of drugs and vaccines has already begun. Modern drug and vaccine development are largely based on genetic engineering and an understanding of host-pathogen interactions at a molecular level. The mobilisation to address the COVID-19 pandemic by scientists worldwide has been remarkable. This includes the feat of the global scientific community who has already produced and publicly shared well over 11,000 complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences at the time of writing (April 23 2020), which we have used here with gratitude. Further initatives in the United Kingdom (https://www.cogconsortium.uk/data/) have already to date produced over 10,000 genomes, some of which overlap with those already available on GISAID.",

The genetic data available at the time looks staggeringly small in comparison to the amount that has already been generated for SARS-CoV-2 during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, Fraser et al. considered 11 partial hemagglutinin gene sequences two months after the WHO had declared 2009 H1N1pdm influenza a pandemic (27) .",

Homoplasies, such as those we detect here, can arise by product of neutral evolution or as a result of ongoing selection. Of the 198 homoplasies we detect (after applying stringent filters), some proportion are very likely genuine targets of positive selection which signpost to ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to its new human host. Indeed, we do observe an enrichment for non-synonymous changes (80%) in our filtered sites. As such, our provided list (Table S5) contains candidates for mutations which may affect the phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 and virus-host interactions and which require ongoing monitoring. Conversely, the finding that 78% of the homoplasic mutations involve no polarity change could still reflect strong evolutionary constraints at these positions (35, 36) . The remaining non-neutral changes to amino acid properties at homoplasic sites may be enriched in candidates for functionally relevant adaptation and could warrant further experimental investigation.",

Interestingly, this region overlaps a putative immunogenic peptide predicted to result in both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell reactivity (37) . More minor homoplasies amongst our top candidates, identified within Orf3a (Table S5) , also map to a predicted CD4 T cell epitope. While the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is poorly understood at this point, key roles for CD4 T cells, which activate B cells for antibody production, and cytotoxic CD8 T cells, which kill virus-infected cells, are known to be important in mediating clearance in respiratory viral infections (38) . Of note, we also identify a strong recurrent mutation in nucleotide position 21575, corresponding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (codon 5). While the spike protein is the known mediator of host-cell entry, our detected homoplasy falls outside of the N-terminal and receptor binding domains.",
