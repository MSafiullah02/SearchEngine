Among more commonly reported opportunists in transplantation, pulmonary nocardiosis infection rates range from 0.7% to 3.5%.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 The largest case series in transplantation describes these infections to be more common among lung recipients (3.5%), followed by recipients of heart (2.5%), intestine (1.3%), kidney (0.2%), and liver (0.1%).7 However, literature reviews are difficult to systematically assess. With more than 50 species in existence, taxonomic classification is fraught with confusion and controversy. Until recently, most isolates causing human disease were labeled \u201cNocardia asteroides\u201d and included organisms with considerable differences in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns.8 With technological advances in molecular genotyping, isolates previously described as N asteroides have been subspeciated.8\nN asteroides is now denoted as N asteroides complex and includes Nocardia nova complex, Nocardia farcinica, Nocardia transvalensis complex, Nocardia abscessus, and, newly, Nocardia cyriacigeorgica.\n8, 9 Moreover, additional species will emerge with continued advances in genotyping methods.",

Conversion to high-dose therapy has been curative, suggesting that prophylaxis dosages are ineffective for nocardiosis prevention but does not indicate a reduced susceptibility once infection is established.3, 6, 7, 10, 17 Most therapeutic regimens use TMP-SMX combined with imipenem, amikacin, third-generation cephalosporins, minocycline, moxifloxacin, or linezolid from concerns about resistance.6, 18 To avoid recidivism, a protracted course of at least 6 to 12 months in immunocompromised patients is recommended.5\n",

Only 6 cases have been reported up to 2001 in solid organ recipients, with only 1 disseminated and others isolated to lung (n = 1) or skin (n = 4).68, 69, 70 Localized infection in HSCT recipients, although much less reported, includes septic arthritis, endophthalmitis, osteomyelitis, cystitis, brain abscess, and cutaneous necrotizing lesions.66 Lung (pneumonia, nonspecific alveolar or interstitial infiltrates, nodules, cavities) is the most commonly involved site of infection, accounting for 39% of HSCT recipients who develop invasive disease.67 Last, especially in the setting of prolonged neutropenia, fusariosis mortality rates are up to 70% to 100% in HSCT recipients. No deaths due to fusariosis have been seen in organ recipients.68\n",

The high morbidity and mortality observed from emerging infections stem from protean manifestations of disease, which delay diagnosis as well as appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Early institution and maintenance of antimicrobial therapy is often restricted by toxicity and interactions with necessary immunosuppressive drugs. Also, limited data on effective antimicrobial regimens exist, with most therapeutic strategies based on anecdotal experiences.",

The interaction of several additional factors including transplant type, surgical technique, underlying metabolic defects, epidemiologic exposures, extent and nature of immunosuppression, and prior antimicrobial use contribute to development of infection. Technological advances have improved diagnostic techniques and modalities to define few new, previously uncharacterized pathogens. Innovations have also enabled definitive genotypic distinctions of pathogens formerly characterized exclusively by phenotypic differences. Finally, the transplant population has experienced increasing numbers, intensification of immunosuppressive regimens, and prolonged survival. Clinicians should focus on prevention of infections if at all possible, consider a broad but rational range of causes of infections in patients presenting with respiratory symptoms and perform early interventional procedures such as bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and/or transbronchial biopsy or surgical biopsy as clinically indicated for adequate diagnostic sampling while maintaining awareness of the potential for multidrug resistance.",
