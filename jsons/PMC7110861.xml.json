Early clinical signs may include blepharospasm and epiphora, but often the most profound sign is intermandibular swelling due to edema and inflammation of the submandibular salivary glands. Exophthalmus and chromodacryorrhea result from swelling of the Harderian gland, and unilateral or bilateral glaucoma/megaloglobus, hyphema, and corneal ulceration can occur secondarily. SDAV infection may potentiate clinical disease caused by M pulmonis or cilia-associated respiratory bacillus infections. Additionally, there are reports that SDAV infection may be associated with clinically significant reproductive disorders or decreased litter production, but this relationship remains unclear [2], [3], [4].",

Clinical signs in adult mice include foot swelling, lethargy, depression, and sudden death [9], with pocks occurring most commonly on the face, muzzle, feet, or abdomen [10]. Gross pathologic changes may include small intestinal mucosal erosions, necrosis and sloughing of distal portions of the tail and limbs, or massive splenic, lymph node, thymic, and hepatic necrosis [9].

Postmortem evaluation of guinea pigs that die may reveal pulmonary consolidation and emphysema with petechiae, while histologic examination may reveal a necrotizing bronchitis and bronchiolitis with basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies.

The first report describes an adult female chinchilla that presented with a history of acute death. Necrotic foci with inclusion bodies were found in the spleen, pineal body, adrenal glands, and medulla of the brain. Electron microscopy was highly suggestive of a herpes-like viral infection based on morphology of the virus and distribution of lesions. In the second case, a 1-year-old male chinchilla with conjunctivitis, uveitis, and bilateral mydriasis for 2 weeks began to show neurologic signs, including disorientation, seizures, and biting at the cage bars, leading to atonic recumbancy. The chinchilla was treated with antibiotics and electrolytes but was euthanized after 3 weeks because of a poor prognosis. Significant pathologic findings included a unilateral purulent rhinitis, keratouveitis, retinopathy, optical neuritis, nonsuppurative meningitis, and polioencephalitis with neuronal necrosis. Intranuclear inclusion bodies were found in many areas of the brain and the nasal cavity. Electron microscopy, immunohistochemical staining, virus isolation, and nucleic acid sequence analysis confirmed an infection with human herpes simplex virus type 1, a common virus carried by humans causing oral or labial lesions that can lead to encephalitis. The authors proposed a primary ocular infection in the chinchilla potentially from contact to a human with a herpetic lesion that subsequently spread to the central nervous system. Although this route of transmission could not be confirmed, this raises the question of whether chinchillas can serve as reservoirs for herpes simplex virus.",

Prairie dogs were exposed to monkeypox when housed in the same pet store as an infected Gambian giant rat and dormice [52] that were imported from Ghana. Animal-to-animal transmission of monkeypox was likely from respiratory and mucocutaneous routes [53].

In humans, clinical signs of monkeypox are similar to those of smallpox but are usually milder and include vesiculopustular skin lesions, fever, headache, muscle aches, lymphadenopathy, and lethargy [54]. Transmission from animals to people can occur via bite wounds, scratches, or exposure to infected blood, body fluids, or skin lesions. In people, mortality rates are reported to be from 1% to 10%; however, no human deaths occurred in the United States outbreak. The smallpox vaccine may be protective against monkeypox.

Transmission of rabies to small mammals is extremely unlikely, because captive-bred animals have minimal exposure to the disease; furthermore, in the wild, when a small mammal comes in contact with a rabies-infected predator, the small mammal is more likely to be consumed than to have the disease transmitted during the encounter.
