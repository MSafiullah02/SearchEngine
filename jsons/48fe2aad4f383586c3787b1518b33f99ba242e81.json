Recently, this problem was extended to discover trending high utility itemsets (itemsets that yield an increasing or decreasing profit over time). However, an important limitation of that problem is that it is assumed that trends remain stable over time. But in real-life, trends may change in different time intervals due to specific events. To identify time intervals where itemsets have increasing/decreasing trends in terms of utility, this paper proposes the problem of mining Locally Trending High Utility Itemsets (LTHUIs) and their Trending High Utility Periods (THUPs). Properties of the problem are studied and an efficient algorithm named LTHUI-Miner is proposed to enumerate all the LTHUIs and their THUPs.

The goal of HUIM is to find all itemsets that have a high utility (e.g. yield a high profit). Though, HUIM is useful to understand customer behavior, a key problem of HUIM is that the time dimension is ignored. But in real-life, the utility of itemsets vary over time. For example, the sales of some products in a retail store may increase or decrease over a few weeks as it loses or gains in popularity.",

However, this problem only focuses on discovering itemsets that have trends spanning over the whole database (e.g. a set of products having sales that always follows an upward or downward trend). But that assumption is often unrealistic as an itemset may have upward or downward trends only during some time periods rather than in the whole database. For instance, the utility (profit) generated by the sale of sunscreen in a store may have an upward trend from May to July but not during the whole year. It is thus an important challenge to design algorithms to identify trends in non predefined time intervals. This is also challenging as it requires to not only consider a large search space of itemsets but also of time intervals.",

FIM algorithms discover frequent itemsets by relying on the anti-monotonicity property of the support measure, which states that the support of an itemset cannot be greater than that of its subsets [1, 5] . This is a very powerful property to reduce the search space, but it does not hold for the utility measure in HUIM. To mine high utility itemsets efficiently, state-of-the-art HUIM algorithms such as Two-Phase [14] , HUI-Miner [15] , d2hup [13] and HU-FIMi [10] introduced various upper-bounds on the utility measure that respect the anti-monotonicity property to reduce the search space, and novel data structures to perform utility computation efficiently.",

The PHM algorithm [3] finds patterns that periodically appear and yield a high profit (e.g. a customer buys wine every week). The RUP algorithm [8] finds itemsets that recently had a high utility by applying a decay function to the utility measure (recent events are considered more important in utility calculations). And recently, to discover itemsets that follow some trends such as an increase or decrease in utility, the TPHUI-Miner algorithm [9] was designed. However, a major limitation of the three above algorithms is that they find patterns that shows some periodic behavior, recent behavior or trends valid for the whole database rather than for specific time intervals.

First, in the above slope calculation, it can be argued that time should be used as denominator instead of the utility because the user is typically interested in how utility varies over time rather than the opposite. Second, the slope of a HUI is calculated for the whole database. Hence, the algorithm of Hackman et al. [9] is unable to find local trends such as a HUI that follows a trend only in a sub-time interval. To address these issues, this paper proposes to mine itemsets that have a high utility and follow an increasing/decreasing trend in some non predefined time intervals. This paper redefines the concepts of utility and slope such that the time is divided into non-overlapping consecutive bins to reduce the influence of small fluctuations in the utility of items. The user must set a bin length binlen \u2208 Z + . Then, the average timestamp and average utility of each bin is used as basis for slope calculations.",

The algorithm takes as input a transaction database D and the binlen, winlen, minutil and minslope parameters. The algorithm outputs all LTHUIs and their maximum THUPs. The algorithm first scans the database to calculate the bins, sliding windows and T W U(i) of each item i. Then, each item i such that T W U(i) < minutil is ignored from further processing as it cannot be part of a LTHUI by Property 1. Then, the processing order \u227a on remaining items is defined as the increasing order of TWU, as in previous work [4] . Then, the algorithm scans the database again to create the TU-list of each remaining item. Thereafter, LTHUI-Miner recursively extends each of those items by appending items following the order. This is done by calling the LTHUISearch procedure (Algorithm 1) with six parameters: (1) an itemset P (initially P = \u2205), (2) a set exP of one-item extensions of P of the form P x = P \u222a {x} where x \u2208 I (initially, the remaining items), (3) binlen, (4) winlen, (5) minutil, and (6) minslope. The procedure first checks if the trendP eriods list of each itemset P x in the set exP is empty. If not, the itemset P x is output as a LT HU I with P x.T U list.trendP eriods as its maximum THUPs. Moreover, if promisingP eriods of P x is not empty and P x is promising in the database according to Property 2, the algorithm will try to extend P x. This is done by joining P x with each itemset P y \u2208 exP such that y x, to obtain itemsets of the form P xy. The TU-list of P xy is constructed by calling the construct procedure. Then, the procedure F indT rend is called to construct the binU tils, binRutils, trendP eriods and promisingP eriods of that TU-list, and P xy is added to a set exP x. Then, the procedure LTHUI-Search is called with P x and exP x to check if itemsets in exP x are LT HU Is and explore their extensions.",

First, the procedure scans the elements of the TU-list of P x to calculate binU tils and binRutils. Then, the procedure moves a sliding window over the sequence of bins BS to calculate the utility and slope of windows using two variables, namely winStart (the index in BS of the first bin of a sliding window, initialized to 0) and winEnd (the index in BS of the last bin of a sliding window, initialized to winlen/binlen). However, the process of sliding a window while calculating the slope and utility may be interrupted because some sliding windows in BS may have empty bins, and the slope cannot be calculated in that case. Thus, a loop is performed to find the next sliding window without empty bins, and then continue the sliding process until an empty bin is encountered or winEnd reaches the last bin of the sequence BS. In more details, this is done by first finding the first no-empty-bin sliding window starting from winStart, updating winStart, winEnd and calculating utils (utility of the itemset P x in that window), rutils (remaining utility of P x in that window) . Then, the following step is repeated until (winEnd + 1) reaches the last bin of BS or the utility of P x in the bin of index (winEnd + 1) is 0 or itemset P is unpromising in the sliding window W [winStart+1,winEnd+1] : (1) increase the index of the first and last bin of the sliding window, then update utils and rutils, (2) compare the value of utils, utils + rutils with minutil to determine whether to merge the sliding window with the previous period or add that window to P x.T U list.trendP eriods and P x.T U list.promisingP eriods.

LTHUI-Miner was implemented in Java. Two real-life datasets with timestamps were used: retail and f oodmart. Let |I|, |D| and A represents the number of distinct items, the number of transactions and the average transaction length. retail contains transactions from an anonymous Belgian retail store (|I| = 16,470, |D| = 88,162, A = 10.30). f oodmart is transactional data obtained and transformed from the SQL-Server 2000 distribution (|I| = 1559, |D| = 4141, A = 4.40). The timestamps of retail and f oodmart were generated by adopting a distribution used in prior work for retail data [7] . 176 times faster than lthui-no-prop3. Memory consumption was also measured to compare the two algorithm versions. It was found that in most cases, the memory usage of lthui is less than lthui-no-prop3, which shows that Property 3 reduces memory consumption. Details are not shown due to the page limitation. Influence of minslope on the Number of Patterns Found. In the second experiment, the minslope parameter was varied to evaluate its influence on the number of patterns found. Algorithms were run with binlen = 1000, winlen = 2 \u00d7 binlen and minutil = 600 on the retail dataset and binlen = 250, winlen = 2 \u00d7 binlen and minutil = 100 on the f oodmart dataset. Results for the number of patterns are shown in Fig. 1 (b) for the two datasets. It is observed that as minslope increases, the number of patterns decreases, which was expected.",

The utility of an itemset X in a window W is defined as: u(X, W ) = B\u2208W u(B, X).We then define the slope of an itemset in a sliding window as follows:Definition 4 (Slope of an itemset in a sliding window). Let A[k] be the k-th element of a sequence of valuesA. The slope of an itemset X in a sliding window W is: slope(X, W ) = k=1...|BN| (AU (X)[k]\u2212avg(AU (X)))\u00d7(AT [k]\u2212avg(AT )) t\u2208AT (t\u2212avg(AT )) 2iff the itemset X appears in each bin of the sliding window W , i.e., AU (X)[k] = 0. A sliding window W meeting that latter condition is called a no-empty-bin sliding window of X. Otherwise, the slope is undefined.

Thus, we compared three versions of LTHUI-Miner: (1) LTHUI-Miner (with all pruning techniques), denoted as lthui, (2) LTHUI-Miner without Property 3, denoted as lthui-no-prop3, and (3) a version of LTHUI-Miner without Property 2 and 3. However, that latter ran out of memory for all the experiments, and thus its results are not reported in the following. Experiments were done by varying the minutil and minslope parameters to see the influence on runtime and pattern count, respectively. No results are shown for an algorithm if it ran out of memory, or the runtime exceeded one hour.",

LTHUI-Miner was run with winlen = 2000 (about 5.5 h), binlen = 1000 and minslope = 0.1 on the retail dataset, and run with winlen = 500, binlen = 250 and minslope = 0.1 on the f oodmart dataset. Fig. 1 (a) compares the runtimes of lthui and lthui-no-prop3 for the two datasets. It is observed that as minutil is decreased, runtime increases, which is reasonable since more patterns may be found. It is also observed that pruning an unpromising itemset in a sliding window using the remaining utility (Property 3) greatly reduces the runtime. For example, on the retail dataset, when minutil = 1500, the execution time of lthui-no-prop3 is 498 s, which is more than 32 times that of lthui, and on the f oodmart dataset, when minutil = 1400, lthui is up to",
