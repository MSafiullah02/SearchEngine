Moreover, in this time of uncertainty and fear, support for patients and their families at diagnosis and during treatment is crucial to ensure they can complete treatment safely.

Here, we recommend the principle that the standards of care for the diagnosis, treatment, and supportive care for children with cancer should not be compromised or electively modified during the pandemic, if at all possible. Globally, the majority of child cancer services are located within combined adult and pediatric hospitals. In these centers, the risk of cross infection of healthcare staff and patients may be very high, and access to diagnostic services such as radiology, pathology, and treatment services, specifically surgery and radiotherapy, may become radically reduced in addition to a redistribution of resources needed for COVID\u201019 adult patients. If resource constraints mandate treatment modification, these should be done by a whole service approach rather than by individual clinical decision\u2010making and should ideally be endorsed by institutional governance or a regional/national professional organization.",

Many services have already implemented some similar measures, but the key message from the Lombardy experience is the need to take an anticipatory approach to rapid service reconfiguration, implement strict and supervised PPE to protect all patients and all staff, and maintain safe but flexible clinical care.

At the time of manuscript preparation, data on the clinical spectrum and outcome of children with cancer and concurrent COVID\u201019 are limited, and further data are awaited.\n16\n However, other coronaviruses can produce more severe disease in immunocompromised children with increased risk with coexisting pulmonary disease or concurrent lower respiratory tract infection.\n17\n, \n18\n Although this is not yet proven for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102/COVID\u201019, prolonged viral shedding (\u2265 21 days) has been documented in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients for other human coronaviruses, particularly in the setting of steroid use, and myeloablative conditioning.\n19\n Failure to clear the infection has implications not only for infection prevention due to risks of nosocomial transmission but also for ongoing therapy. Clinical experience with other respiratory viruses in HSCT patients indicates that progression from a mild infection, such as an uncomplicated upper airway infection, to a more severe infection, such as a lower respiratory tract infection, is a potentially life\u2010threatening complication and the clinical worsening may occur later in the course of the infection.\n20\n\n",

Where a patient presents with advanced cancer and concurrent COVID\u201019 (either symptomatic or detected on screening), the essential investigations should be done to establish an accurate cancer diagnosis, and interim therapy to control disease may be a safe approach and permit recovery from COVID\u201019 before commencing disease\u2010directed treatment. In nonemergency presentations with concurrent COVID\u201019, such as an abdominal mass, intraocular retinoblastoma, or low\u2010stage Hodgkin lymphoma, it is reasonable and safe to defer diagnostic investigations until the child has recovered and proceed with resource\u2010adapted investigations as best can be achieved.

The message also needs to go out to parents that they should continue to seek medical advice if they have serious concerns about the health of their child. Early evidence is that parents are staying away from emergency rooms and medical assessments, raising the concern that there may be increased toxic deaths on treatment and a future surge in late presentations of new childhood cancers.",

The first supplement provides consensus opinion formed between tumor type\u2013specific clinical experts from the major clinical trial groups in North America and Europe and the leadership who have developed equivalent adapted treatment regimens for LMICs. The second supplement provides more details on possible modifications to service delivery that have been considered by the leaders of global associations for the full range of pediatric disciplines and staff groups. These are necessarily \u201cbroad brush\u201d as healthcare providers will be required to follow national and institutional requirements. The specific examples included from centers with several weeks experience demonstrate what is possible in a high\u2010income context. Those working in more resource\u2010limited settings will have fewer options, but we urge them to prioritize continuing therapy as much as possible for children with highly curable cancers. Also, to work with their public health colleagues to send a clear message to parents and communities, fear of COVID\u201019 infection should not prevent seeking medical assessment if they have serious concerns about their child's health.\n21\n\n",

We urge all services to make full use of the St Jude\u2010SIOP platform and registry to achieve this.\n73\n, \n74\n We hope there will be some positive changes in ways of working that may endure, if they are shown to be better for patients, such as increased use of oral therapies and telemedicine. Careful documentation and prospective evaluation of these treatment and service changes is needed to ensure this. More worrying is the potential for children with cancer to become indirect victims of the COVID\u201019 pandemic, due to late diagnosis and disrupted therapies. Epidemiological research to monitor incidence and survival across this pandemic will be critical to understanding the extent to which this occurs and to plan actions for recovery. Childhood cancer parents\u2019 organizations can play an important role in reassuring parents of children with known or suspected cancer to seek prompt clinical assessment and by disseminating, in cooperation with healthcare professionals, a clear and accessible message.",
