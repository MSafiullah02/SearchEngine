We thus used available sequences of bat and pangolin viruses to determine the selective events that shaped the genome structure of SARS-CoV-2 and to assess its coding potential. By searching for signals of significantly reduced variability at synonymous sites (dS), we identified six genomic regions, one of these corresponding to the programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift. The most prominent signal of dS reduction was observed within the E gene. A genome-wide analysis of conserved RNA structures indicated that this region harbors a putative functional RNA element that is shared with the SARS-CoV lineage. Additional signals of reduced dS indicated the presence of internal ORFs. Whereas the presence ORF9a (internal to N) was previously proposed by homology with a well characterized protein of SARS-CoV, ORF3h (for hypothetical, within ORF3a) was not previously described. The predicted product of ORF3h has 90% identity with the corresponding predicted product of SARS-CoV and displays features suggestive of a viroporin. Finally, analysis of the putative ORF10 revealed high dN/dS (3.82) in SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses. In the SARS-CoV lineage, the ORF is predicted to encode a truncated protein and is neutrally evolving. These data suggest that ORF10 encodes a functional protein in SARS-CoV-2 and that positive selection is driving its evolution. Experimental analyses will be necessary to validate and characterize the coding and noncoding functional elements we identified. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof 3",

The virus caused respiratory disease in a large number of people and was responsible for thousands of deaths . Eventually, SARS-CoV-2 reached other countries: outbreaks in Italy, Japan, South Korea, and other areas are ongoing (www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/).

A bat origin seems also to be likely for SARS-CoV-2, as to date its closest relative (BatCoV RaTG13) was sequenced from 5 pangolin-derived viruses and SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the surface spike glycoprotein (Wong et al., 2020) , which represents a major determinant of coronavirus host range (Haijema et al., 2003 ,Kuo et al., 2000 ,McCray et al., 2007 ,Moore et al., 2004 ,Schickli et al., 2004 . Overall, these reports suggest that recombination events have shaped the diversity of the spike protein and contributed to the diversification of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses (Wong et al., 2020 .

Importantly, several coronavirus proteins modulate immune evasion, tissue tropism, and virulence, eventually playing a role in disease severity and pathogenesis (Cui et al., 2019 ,Forni et al., 2017 . Indeed, coronaviruses have unusually long and complex genomes if compared to those of other RNA viruses. Two thirds of the coronavirus genome are occupied by two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), that are translated into polyproteins. These latter are processed to generate 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16). The remaining portion of the genome includes ORFs for the structural proteins (spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleoprotein) and a variable number of accessory proteins (Cui et al., 2019 ,Forni et al., 2017 . Gene gains and losses during the evolutionary history of coronaviruses have resulted in a diverse array of accessory ORFs, even among viruses belonging to the same lineage (Forni et al., 2017) .",

To identify such elements, which include ORFs with alternative reading frames and RNA structural elements, synplot2 searches for regions with a statistically significant reduction in the rate of substitution at synonymous sites (dS). The analysis identified six regions of significantly low dS (Fig. 1c) . One of these corresponds to the region of programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) between ORFs 1a and 1b. A similar dS reduction was previously reported in this region for SARS-CoV (using an alignment of betacoronaviruses) and indicates the presence of an RNA pseudoknot structure (Firth, 2014 ,Plant et al., 2005 . One signal was present in the nsp3 region within ORF1a, but no potential ORF was found in the corresponding region, in line with the fact that alternative proteins encoded from ORF1a or ORF1b have not been described in coronaviruses. Likewise, no alternative reading frame was detected in the prominent signal within the E (envelope) gene. Notably, a reduction of dS was previously noted in the E gene for other betacoronaviruses, including SARS-CoV (Firth, 2014) .",

As expected, the RNA pseudoknot was not predicted, as RNAz is not devised to predict this kind of structures (Hamada, 2015) . Using very conservative criteria (see methods), we detected three conserved secondary structures (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Table S2 ). The first is located within J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ORF1a, at the 3' boundary of one of the recombination events, the second is within ORF3a, and the last one covers almost entirely the E gene. Clearly, structure conservation might be secondary to sequence conservation (Washietl et al., 2005) . We thus repeated the RNAz analysis on a genome alignment that included more divergent coronaviruses (SARS-CoV lineage, Supplementary Table   S2 ). Using the same criteria as above, the only highly conserved RNA structure we detected was the one overlapping with the E gene.

The predicted protein product of ORF10 is 38 amino acids long and is potentially encoded by the pangolin and bat viruses we analyzed, with the exception of bat-SL-CoVZXC21, in which a one nucleotdide deletion alters the reading frame. It is presently impossible to determine whether this is the result of a sequencing error or of a mutation event in this virus. Analysis of more distantly related coronaviruses (SARS-CoV lineage) indicated that the reading frame of ORF10 is interrupted by a stop codon (Fig. 3) . To assess the potential functional relevance of ORF10, we calculated the nonsynonymous over synonymous substitution rate (dN/dS). For viruses potentially encoding the full length protein, dN/dS resulted equal to 3.82, whereas a value close to selective neutrality (dN/dS = 1.18) was observed for viruses carrying a truncated ORF10 protein (Fig. 3) . High values of dN/dS may be due to either positive selection or to relaxed purifying selection. To disentangle these possibilities, we applied the RELAX method, which evaluates if selection on the test branches (encoding full-length protein) is relaxed (k < 1) compared to background branches (encoding truncated protein) (see methods) (Wertheim et al., 2015) . We obtained a k=5.65 , which excludes the hypothesis of relaxed constraint. Overall, this suggests that ORF10 is evolving under positive selection in viruses related to SARS-CoV-2. Analysis of the potential ORF10 protein indicated the presence of a predicted transmembrane domain.",

It is therefore essential to characterize coronavirus genomes in terms of coding potential and functional elements. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the little we know about its genetic make up mainly derives from comparison with SARS-CoV, which has been extensively studied since its emergence as a human pathogen in 2002. However, the coding potential of SARS-CoV-2 is still uncertain and the presence of non-coding functional elements is poorly explored, even for SARS-CoV. By allowing the detection of evolutionary constrained sequences, comparative genomic approaches can provide clues about the presence of functional elements, either coding or non-coding. We thus focused on viruses that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2 and we used evolutionary inference to characterize their genomes. By searching for signals of significantly low dS, we identified six genomic regions, one of these associated with the -1 PRF.",

In addition to the UTRs, the role of an RNA pseudoknot in programmed -1 frameshifting was mentioned above and is a conserved feature of coronaviruses (Firth, 2014 ,Plant et al., 2005 ,Irigoyen et al., 2016 . However, recent experimental data indicated that structured RNA elements are pervasive throughout the genomes of RNA viruses (Boerneke et al., 2019) . For instance, extensive probing of several humaninfecting viruses (e.g. HCV, HIV, ZIKV, DENV) revealed that RNA elements have diverse functions and often modulate viral fitness by regulation of viral transcription, protein synthesis, and replication, as well as by favoring the evasion of the host immune responses (Boerneke et al., 2019) .",

Thus, these unexplained signals might represent additional conserved RNA structures. Further analysis, possibly with a larger number of SARS-CoV-2-related genomes will clarify this point. Conversely, two regions of reduced dS corresponded to alternative reading frames (ORF9a and ORF3h). The presence ORF9a was previously proposed (Wu et al., 2020b) and the encoded predicted protein shares homology with a multifunctional, well characterized protein (9b) of SARS-CoV (Xu et al., 2009 , Meier et al., 2006 .

The protein oligomerizes to form ion channels and localizes to the mitochondria, where it can induce apoptosis by depolarization of the membrane potential (Chen et J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof al., , Chen et al., 2007 . Several coronaviruses encode two viroporins, whereas SARS-CoV encodes three proteins with channel-forming activity (3a, E, and 8a) (Castano-Rodriguez et al., 2018) , suggesting that multiple viroporins are beneficial for the virus. Because viroporins can modulate virulence and are regarded as possible targets for antivirals (Forni et al., 2017 ,Royle et al., 2015 , it will be important to determine whether the 3h protein is translated and if it displays channel-forming activity. It is also worth noting that SARS-CoV encodes a 3b protein (154 amino acids in size) that is translated in a different frame than 3a and inhibits interferon (IFN) production and signaling (Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007) . Based on the synplot2 results, the 3b protein was not predicted to be encoded by SARS-CoV-2, as no dS reduction was observed other than the putative ORF 3h. In line with this observation, analysis of ORF3 revealed that the reading frame for the 3b protein is interrupted by a STOP codon at position 23, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 lacks this IFN antagonist. However, as previously reported, the function of the 3b protein of SARS-CoV is redundant with those of ORF6 (with an effect on both IFN production and signaling) and N (which only affects IFN production), suggesting that distinct, although related coronaviruses display different arrays of immunomodulatory proteins (Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007) .",

Calculation of dN/dS revealed a value of 3.82 in these viruses, whereas in the SARS-CoV lineage the ORF encoding a truncated protein appears to be neutrally evolving. These data suggest that ORF10 might encode a functional protein in SARS-CoV-2 and that positive selection is driving its evolution. Again, additional data, including genomes of other coronaviruses encoding a full-length protein, as well as experimental analyses, will be required to test this hypothesis. Indeed, a clear limitation of our study lies in the quality and paucity of genomes from viruses related to SARS-CoV-2. Available sequences were obtained using different methods: they most likely contain errors and display missing information in several regions (especially the genomes deriving from pangolins). Whereas J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f this is unlikely to strongly affect most results, especially analyses that were performed over sliding windows and thus rely signals from relatively long regions, the availability of additional genomes will indubitably increase the power to detect selective events and the confidence with which evolutionary patterns are inferred. For instance, the lack of evidence of positive selection should not be regarded as conclusive, but might be due to the low statistical power of the LRT with as few as six sequences.",

Each bar represents the recombinant sequence with the corresponding name and the genomic location of the recombination event. Colors indicate the major and the minor parental sequences (color coding as in panel a); gray color indicates an unknown parental sequence.

Plot of synonymous sites substitution (dS) along SARS-CoV-2 lineage coding sequences. The brown line indicates relative dS variability calculated as the ratio of the observed over the expected values of dS in a sliding window of 25 codons. The red line shows the corresponding p-value and the dashed line represents the p-value cutoff. A schematic representation of SARS-CoV-2 ORFs is reported; ORFs that are not annotated in the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NC_045512.2) are in red (genomic positions 25457-25582, 28284-28577, and 28734-28955 of the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome correspond to ORF3h, ORF9a, and ORF9b) . The location of the three predicted conserved RNA secondary structures isshown. Structures were rendered using RNAalifold. The color scheme reflects the mutational pattern with respect to the structure. Thus, colors indicate conserved base pairs: from red (conservation of only one base-pair type) to purple (all six base-pair types are found); from dark (all sequences contain this base pair) to light colors (1 or 2 sequences are unable to form this base pair).",
