            "text": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a disease affecting predominantly premature infants, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in neonatal intensive care units. Although several predisposing factors have been identified, such as prematurity, enteral feeding, and infection, its pathogenesis remains elusive. In the past 20 years, we have established several animal models of NEC in rats and found several endogenous mediators, especially platelet-activating factor (PAF), which may play a pivotal role in NEC. Injection of PAF induces intestinal necrosis, and PAF antagonists prevent the bowel injury induced by bacterial endotoxin, hypoxia, or challenge with tumor necrosis factor-\u2423 (TNF) plus endotoxin in adult rats. The same is true for lesions induced by hypoxia and enteral feeding in neonatal animals. Human patients with NEC show high levels of PAF and decreased plasma PAFacetylhydrolase, the enzyme degrading PAF. The initial event in our experimental models of NEC is probably polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) activation and adhesion to venules in the intestine, which initiates a local inflammatory reaction involving proinflammatory mediators including TNF, complement, prostaglandins, and leukotriene C 4 . Subsequent norepinephrine release and mesenteric vasoconstriction result in splanchnic isch-emia and reperfusion. Bacterial products (e.g., endotoxin) enter the intestinal tissue during local mucosal barrier breakdown, and endotoxin synergizes with PAF to amplify the inflammation. Reactive oxygen species produced by the activated leukocytes and by intestinal epithelial xanthine oxidase may be the final pathway for tissue injury. Protective mechanisms include nitric oxide produced by the constitutive (mainly neuronal) nitric oxide synthase, and indigenous probiotics such as Bifidobacteria infantis. The former maintains intestinal perfusion and the integrity of the mucosal barrier, and the latter keep virulent bacteria in check. The development of tissue injury depends on the balance between injurious and protective mechanisms.",

Intestinal necrosis, representing a latestage response, is consistent with a common pathogenesis, but disparate etiologies are possible. Necrosis of the intestine can occur at any age following the sudden, complete occlusion of the blood supply to the bowel. In the newborn, thromboemboli secondary to intravascular catheters may cause bowel infarction. However, since neonatal NEC cannot be traced to thromboemboli, it is considered nosologically distinct from this kind of bowel infarction. Therefore, in the following discussion, NEC is understood to exclude cases of bowel infarction associated with thromboembolic lesions.",

A disease of serious prognosis, advanced cases of NEC may cause multisystem organ failure [3] . Of the 2500 cases occurring annually in the United States [4, 5] , 20 -60% require surgical treatment [6] . At least 80% of patients are preterm, or have low, or very low birth weight, and the incidence of the disease is inversely proportional to the gestational age [4, 7, 8] . Advances in the supportive care of premature babies, such as the use of surfactant, improved technologies for mechanical ventilation, and wider availability of skilled personnel, enable the very premature to survive, and in so doing increase the population of patients susceptible to NEC. Thus, it may be that despite medical advances that would potentially reduce the incidence of the disease, the incidence of NEC remains unchanged over the last 20 years [1, 9] . Infants of extremely low birth weight (\u03fd 1000 g) and those 28 wk or less of gestational age are at greater risk of NEC than infants born closer to term. The severity of the disease, risks of complications, and mortality are greater in infants of extremely low birth weight [10] .",

The initi-ating and pathogenetic factors may differ in patients of different age groups. In any case, the clinical consequences do not differ substantially in the various patient populations, including the infants of extremely low birth weight or extreme prematurity [10] . The symptoms have been staged according to widely used criteria [12, 13] . The infant manifests abdominal distension (among the most common signs of NEC), vomiting, increased gastric residual, lethargy, apnea, bradycardia, or guaiac-positive stools. In stage I, there are no clear radiological signs, and these nonspecific manifestations suggest the disease but give no indication of the status of the bowel or the prognosis. In stage II, the diagnosis is clearly established, with the appearance of pneumatosis intestinalis or free air in the portal vein. Stage III indicates more advanced disease, as manifested by shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acidosis, thrombocytopenia, and sometimes intestinal perforation.",

This may be because of remoteness of the ileocolic arterial branches from the main blood supply of the superior mesenteric artery, which also supplies the proximal intestine. In about half the cases, the necrosis involves both the small and large intestine; continuous or discontinuous involvement occurs in approximately equal proportions [16, 17] . The affected bowel is grossly distended, lusterless, and gray or greenish-gray, but it may be dark purple or black in the areas containing extensive hemorrhage. The soft, fragile wall may perforate when the involvement is severe and transmural. Perforation tends to occur at the junction between normal and necrotic bowel, but it may appear in the midst of a devitalized region, and sometimes at more than one site.

Nowicki [18] distinguished extrinsic and intrinsic mecha-NEONATAL NECROTIZING ENTEROCOLITIS nisms of vascular regulation. Extrinsic vascular regulation integrates the circulation of the intestine with systemic cardiovascular reflexes. An atavistic \"diving reflex\" (so named after the physiological changes noted in seals upon diving) [18] has been hypothesized in neonates who experience severe anoxic episodes, during which blood is diverted preferentially to the heart and the brain, to the detriment of the abdominal organs. Although the diving reflex hypothesis is supported by much experimental evidence in animals [18] , it cannot satisfactorily explain all the clinical observations in NEC. Presumably, the reflex takes place as a result of a postulated ischemic insult during parturition [19] , whereas the manifestations of NEC usually start during the 2nd wk of postnatal life. Vascular reactivity in early postnatal life has been assumed to differ from that of older subjects. However, the intestinal vasculature of 2-3-day-old piglets manifests autoregulatory \"escape\" from sustained sympathetic stimulation, in the same manner as the intestine of older swine. Experimentally, sympathoadrenergic stimulation causes transient intestinal vasoconstriction, and normal oxygen uptake is restored after 3 to 5 min [20, 21] . Moreover, prospective clinical studies do not always establish an association between neonatal hypoxia or asphyxia and the development of NEC: most patients with NEC have no clinically apparent hypoxemia at birth [7, 18, 20] . These discrepancies by no means exclude an important participa-tion of autonomic neural influences in the development of NEC. Other extrinsic regulatory mechanisms, such as the participation of the renin-angiotensin axis in bowel ischemia deserve serious investigation. Angiotensin receptors are densely distributed in the bowel [22] . This may explain why ischemic colitis that develops from mesenteric vasoconstriction during experimental cardiogenic shock cannot be prevented by total adrenergic blockade but is completely abolished by drugs such as captopril, which ablate the reninangiotensin axis [23] .",

            "text": "Necrosis of the bowel can develop secondary to mesenteric thromboembolism. In neonates, thrombosis is usually an untoward effect of the placement of an umbilical artery catheter. However, in most patients with NEC, no occlusion of large arteries can be identified. NEC and infarction are probably different clinicopathological entities, even though both manifest coagulative necrosis. An infarct is usually single and should follow the distribution of the arterial blood supply. In contrast, NEC is basically an inflammatory process, and a venule may be the initiating site of the pathophysiology. The affected areas are often multiple, are random, and are not necessarily related to the arterial supply. The early histological change of NEC is coagulative necrosis, but inflammatory cells infiltrate when the disease progresses [17] . Bacteria are important in NEC, since the disease does not occur before the colonization of the intestine by bacteria. In a fetus whose intestinal contents are sterile, compromise of the blood supply may result in intestinal injury. In the healing process, atresia or stenosis may develop. Anaerobic bacteria in the lumen of the bowel might be expected to proliferate in a segment of devitalized bowel. Bacterial overgrowth in NEC seems to exceed that in other diseases with ischemic bowel [17] . Intestinal pneumatosis, the peculiar and characteristic finding seen in many cases of NEC, is not observed in infarcts. The formation of gas bubbles within the wall of the intestine (Fig. 1D) , develops largely as a result of the fermentation of intraluminal contents by bacteria, and is associated more with NEC than with any other necrotizing conditions affecting the intestine. Bacterial production of P-galactosidase, which reduces pH by fermentation of lactose, has been suggested to contribute to the development of NEC [26] . The ability of colonizing bacteria to ferment lactose is not correlated with the production of NEC [27] ; moreover, the endemic cases of NEC are not consistently associated with a single infectious agent or with a particularly virulent organism that produces highly damaging toxins or that displays great entero-invasiveness or entero-aggregative ability. Disparate microorganisms have been isolated from the stools of NEC patients, and in some cases from both blood and stools: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Salmonella, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium butyricum [28] , coagulase-negative Staphylococci [29] , coronavirus, rotavirus, and enteroviruses [30] .",

Systemic administration of PAF induces an immediate and sometimes transient hypotensive response. With large doses, the shock becomes profound, irreversible, and intestinal necrosis develops rapidly. Early injury is usually detectable within 15 min. PAF is probably the most potent systemically administered agent for inducing intestinal injury. In our experiments, as little as 2.5 g/kg often caused small intestinal necrosis of varying degree in the rat. Since rat platelets are refractory to PAF [33, 49] , the pathogenesis of necrosis cannot be due to the thromboembolic effect of PAF. The necrosis, usually focal, involved the jejunum, ileum, especially the distal ileum, and/or cecum. With high doses, the entire small bowel could be affected. The necrosis began at the villus tip ( Fig. 2A ) [33] , often involved more than half of the villus (Fig. 2B) , and sometimes extended to the submucosa or even the serosa (Fig.  2C ).",

LPS is a potent \"priming\" agent for PAF: a small dose of LPS (0.5 mg/kg) acts synergistically with a low dose of PAF (Table 1 ) [33, 34, 50] . LPS-induced intestinal injury is blocked by pretreatment with PAF antagonists [32] , suggesting that this effect is mediated by endogenous PAF. One probable reason why the small intestine, in particular the ileum, is especially sensitive to PAF action, is its high content of PAF receptors (PAF-R). Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we found that the ileum has the highest number of PAF-R transcripts: (3.49 \u03ee 0.15) \u03eb 10 7 molecules/g RNA [51] . The PAF-R content of jejunum was only 56% of that of the ileum, and the spleen was only 30%. Other organs, e.g., lung, kidney, heart, stomach, and liver, had less than 1% of that of ileum [51] . PAF, even at doses below those causing bowel necrosis, almost doubled PAF-R mRNA in the intestine [51] . The increase was biphasic; the second peak (at 6 h) seemed dependent on endogenous PAF and TNF [51] . In the small intestine, PAF receptor was localized mainly in epithelial cells and eosinophils of the lamina propria [52] .",

P-selectin-deficient mice and fucoidin-treated intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) deficient mice are also protected from the adverse effects of PAF [63] , suggesting a possible role of P-selectin. Paradoxically, fucoidin, a potent inhibitor of selectins, shows no protective effect [62, 63] . The marked increase in PMN influx (adhered to vessels) is reflected by the increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) content in the intestine [62] .

            "text": "The final effector of PAF causing cell injury is most likely reactive oxygen species (ROS). One of the major endogenous sources of ROS in the intestine is the xanthine dehydrogenase/xanthine oxidase system (XD/XO) [64] . XD, the precursor of XO, is constitutively and abundantly expressed in the intestinal villus epithelium [58, 65] , which catalyzes the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine, coupled with the reduction of NAD \u03e9 to NADPH. Because XO uses molecular oxygen rather than NAD \u03e9 as an electron receptor and thereby generates superoxide, XD to XO conversion (during ischemia) has been suggested to play the central role in intestinal reperfusion injury [64] . In normal rat intestine, the total XD\u03e9XO content (XD/XO ratio approximately 80:20) is higher in the jejunum than in the ileum (the colon has low XD\u03e9XO) [58] . Interestingly, following PAF challenge, it is the ileum that shows the most dramatic XD to XO conversion (more than twofold increase in XO) [58] . This change is rapid, detected at 15 min, and by 60 min, more than 60% of the total XD\u03e9XO activity has converted to XO [58] . The conversion takes place mainly in the villus epithelial cells, but not in the crypt epithelium, and the major pathway is probably via activated protease [58] . How this activation is related to PMN activation and adhesion to endothelial cells, remains enigmatic. The central role of XO and ROS in causing the injury is supported by pretreatment with allopurinol [58, 66] , a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, which largely prevents PAF-induced bowel necrosis ( Table 2 ). Infusion of superoxide dismutase plus catalase also alleviates the injury [66] (Table 2) .",

We have shown that LPS (2 mg/kg) and PAF (1 g/kg), at doses below those causing shock and intestinal injury, stimulate TNF gene expression and protein production in the rat's liver and small intestine, predominantly in the ileum [74] (Fig. 3) . WEB-2086, a PAF antagonist, only partially blocked LPS-induced TNF mRNA formation (Fig. 3) , suggesting that LPS induces TNF formation via both PAF-dependent and PAF-independent pathways. In normal intestine, TNF is constitutively expressed at very low levels within Paneth cells [75] . During the acute stage of NEC, TNF gene transcripts markedly increase not only within Paneth cells, but also in lamina propria eosinophils, and infiltrating (but not resident) macrophages [76] . Paneth cells are also rich in group IIA phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 -IIA) [77] , an acute phase protein, which is also upregulated by PAF [78] . Production of many proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF, is upregulated by transcription factors, such as nuclear factor B (NF-B) [79] . TNF activates NF-B in vitro [79, 80] , a pathway that may be involved in TNF self-activation. Low doses of TNF (1 mg/kg) or PAF (1 g/kg), which are below those causing shock and intestinal injury, increase the mRNA of NF-B precursor, p50/p105, in the small intestine [81] . The action of PAF is as potent as, but more rapid than, that of LPS [81] . PAF also rapidly induces NF-B nuclear translocation and activation in the intestine, mainly as p50 homodimers [82] . LPS also activates NF-B, but as p50 -p65 dimer, and its effect is partly mediated via endogenous PAF and TNF [83] . The role of this transcription factor is unclear, but preliminary experiments show that blocking NF-B with decoy [84] or with NF-B essential modulator (NEMO) (IKK\u2425) binding peptide [85] attenuates PAF-induced injury.",

PAF alters the cytoskeletal structure of the intestinal epithelium and induces tyrosine phosphorylation of E-cadherin, an epithelial membrane component of the zona adherens [86] . This may be physiologic, since glucose-induced increased mucosal permeability is blocked by PAF antagonists [86] . In NEC, this action of PAF may facilitate the entry of bacterial products, e.g., LPS from the gut lumen into the tissues, triggering the inflammatory cascade. Indeed, our data suggest that endogenous bacterial toxins from the intestinal lumen play a central role in PAF-induced shock and bowel injury: (1) endotoxin-resistant mice are protected from PAF-induced intestinal injury [87] ; (2) germ-free rats are protected from PAF-induced prolonged shock and bowel injury, and the protection is lost when these animals are primed with exogenous LPS [88] ; and (3) conventional rats, treated with combined anti- PAF induces tumor necrosis factor (TNF) mRNA production in the rat liver and ileum. mRNA from the liver and the small intestine was extracted 30 min after injection of a low dose (1 g/kg, iv) of PAF, LPS (2 mg/kg, iv), or WEB-2086 (1 mg/kg) plus LPS. Results calculated from Northern blot analysis [62] . \u2424-Actin, a housekeeping gene, is used as the common denominator for calculation, and quantity of TNF mRNA is expressed as ratio of TNF mRNA/\u2424-actin mRNA. Sham-op., sham operation; LPS, lipopolysaccharide (bacterial endotoxin); WEB, WEB-2086. (From Hsueh et al. [132] , with permission.) biotics which markedly decrease intestinal bacteria, are protected to a large extent from the injurious effects of PAF [88] (Table 2) . PAF probably causes intestinal injury and deleterious systemic changes via a synergistic action with endogenous bacterial toxins from intestinal bacteria [34, 89] . LPS may not be the only bacterial product that synergizes with PAF to produce tissue damage, since polymyxin B (which inhibits LPS) alone was without protective effects [88] .",

Although iNOS is constitutively present (mainly in the epithelial cells), it accounts for less than 10% of the total NOS activity [95, 96] , and eNOS is barely detectable in the intestine. PAF rapidly decreases intestinal nNOS protein, mRNA, and enzyme activity [95] (Fig. 4C) , but has little effect on iNOS [96] . Interestingly, the degree of injury is inversely re-lated to the nNOS activity, suggesting a protective role of nNOS. The protective role of NO is supported by the following observation: (1) NOS inhibitor L-NAME aggravates PAF-induced necrosis [97] ; (2) iNOS inhibitors are protective only when there is \"sufficient\" nNOS activity [96] ; and (3) NO donors significantly reduce PAF-induced bowel injury [96] .

Thirty minutes of moderate hypoxia produced mild to moderate ischemic bowel necrosis, with no evidence of necrosis in any other organs.

Pathologic findings were similar to human NEC. Grossly, the intestine was hemorrhagic, with friable, occasionally segmental lesions, but often involving most of the intestinal length.

WEB 2170 in appropriate enteral dosing (10 mg/kg q am/30 mg/kg q pm) significantly reduced the incidence of NEC and death compared with controls (Table 4) . A four-fold higher WEB 2170 dosing regimen did not alter the incidence of NEC, presumably because of an agonist effect on the PAF receptor at very high doses [118] . In contrast, WEB 2086 did not reduce the incidence of NEC in stressed animals, presumably because WEB 2086 has a much shorter half-life than WEB 2170. Intestinal PAF concentrations were elevated (270 \u03ee 80 pg/g) in animals stressed with asphyxia, formula feeding, and bacterial inoculation compared with age-matched, healthy, maternally fed controls (70 \u03ee 50 pg/g, P \u03fd 0.05). To further clarify the role of endogenous PAF in NEC, neonatal rats were treated with the PAF degrading enzyme, PAF-acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), as enteral supplementation in doses approximately 10-fold higher than found in human breast milk. This intervention markedly reduced the incidence of NEC from 19/26 in controls to 6/26 (P \u03fd 0.05) [119] . In addition, PAF-AH (human, recombinant protein) was identified by immunohistochemistry throughout the intestinal tract and remained functionally active for greater than 24 h after dosing [119] . Interestingly, there was no measurable human PAF-AH in the circulation of animals using a sensitive monoclonal antibody/enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique [119] . Taken together, the data support the hypothesis that endogenous PAF acts as a critical mediator in this neonatal rat model of NEC.",

Since healthy breast-milk fed neonates are colonized with multiple flora including a predominance of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, neonatal animals were treated with 10 9 Bifidobacteria infantis organisms/day and evaluated for the development of NEC, endotoxin translocation, mucosal permeability, and PLA 2 -II mRNA expression. Bifidobacteria infantis supplementation reduced the incidence of NEC (7/24 vs. 19/27 control, P \u03fd 0.05) but did not alter the colonization pattern of gram negative organisms [122] . Bifidobacteria infantis were identified in the stool and intestinal lumen of treated animals but absent in controls. In addition, Bifidobacteria infantis treatment markedly reduced PLA 2 -II gene expression in intestinal tissue (42 \u03ee 29 mol/g tissue vs. 802 \u03ee 320 control, P \u03fd 0.01) but had no effect on mucosal permeability [122] . The results suggest that Bifidobacteria infantis reduces the incidence of NEC by altering PAF metabolism and bacterial translocation. The role of polyunsaturated fatty acids on the inflammatory cascade, especially the omega-3 fish oil preparations, have been well recognized. Since these compounds seem to reduce the incidence of NEC in a human trial, we evaluated them in the neonatal rat model. Animals were treated with arachidonic acid (34 mg/100 ml) and docosohexanoic acid (23 mg/100 ml) and studied for the development of NEC, PLA 2 gene expression, apoptosis, and endotoxin translocation. PUFA supplementation did not alter the semiquantitative assessment of intestinal epithelial apoptosis, but it reduced the incidence of NEC and death compared to controls, and decreased endotoxinemia at 24 and 48 h. Furthermore, PUFA decreased PLA 2 mRNA synthesis but had no effect on iNOS gene expression in intestinal homogenate [123] .",

Some data from human studies suggest a similar pathophysiology in neonatal NEC. Local and systemic PAF concentrations are elevated in neonates with NEC, and feeding alone promotes PAF production. We and other investigators found higher circulating plasma levels of PAF and/or PAF-like phospholipid in NEC patients compared with agematched, illness-matched controls [124, 125] . These NEC patients also had higher circulating TNF-\u2423 levels [124] and lower plasma acetylhydrolase activity (PAF-degrading enzyme) than control babies. Enteral feeding itself caused elevations of circulating PAF levels in a significant percentage of preterm infants [126] , although the circulating acetylhydrolase activity was not affected by the feeding regimen. Circulating PAF may not adequately reflect the activity in the local environment (intestinal lumen/mucosa), but stool PAF concentrations also increased with feedings [127] . Fourteen days after feedings were begun, the PAF levels were approximately threefold higher than prefeed-ing values (1028 \u03ee 244 pg/g vs. 357 \u03ee 76 pg/g, P \u03fd 0.05) [126] . Stool samples from seven patients with NEC (stage II or III) had the highest levels, with a mean PAF concentration eightfold higher than controls (2484 \u03ee 154 pg/g) [127] .",

Several factors may predispose newborns and especially premature infants to NEC, e.g., immature gastrointestinal host defense, dysfunctional mesenteric blood flow autoregulation, and low PAF-degrading enzyme acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) [55, 128] . Although plasma PAF-AH activity is lower in NEC patients than in controls [124] , PAF-AH activity is low in newborns as a group, reaching normal adult values at 6 wk of life [129] . Infants fed with breast milk (containing significant PAF-AH activity) have a much lower risk of NEC than infants fed with formula (without measurable PAF-AH activity) [130] . In animal experiments, upregulation of PAF-AH can prevent ischemic bowel necrosis following exogenous PAF infusion [131] . These data strongly support the role of PAF in neonatal NEC and suggest that low neonatal PAF-AH activity may in part explain the neonates' predilection of NEC.",

            "text": "We hypothesize that the initial insult in the chain of events leading to NEC could be perinatal hypoxia or a mild postnatal infection, either of which results in mild mucosal damage (Fig. 6 ). Following formula feeding and the proliferation of the intestinal flora, bacteria may attach to the damaged intestinal epithelium because of immaturity of the \"mucosal barrier,\" thus eliciting endogenous production of PAF (and PAF-like phospholipids) and TNF. The major source of PAF may be epithelial cells, lamina propria cells, or endothelial cells. Although gut bacteria may themselves form PAF, the normal mucosal barrier probably prevents any deleterious action on the epithelium. However, in immature or mildly damaged mucosa, the close proximity of bacteria and intestinal epithelial cells may facilitate transcellular permeation of PAF into the mucosa. If the acetylhydrolase is low (as in the case of premature infants), PAF, which increases the intestinal epithelial permeability in vivo, may ac-cumulate locally, leading to focal mucosal \"leak\" and local entry of bacteria or bacterial products. PAF may then synergize with LPS and/or TNF, reaching the threshold necessary to trigger a cascade of inflammatory events: PMN activation and adhesion to venular endothelium, increase in vascular permeability, complement activation, NF-B translocation, induction of proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules, and release of ROS and inflammatory mediators (including LTC 4 , prostaglandins, and PAF). Eventually, vasoconstriction occurs leading to ischemia and subsequent reperfusion. Activation of xanthine oxidase with massive reactive oxygen species production occurs as a consequence of ischemia and/or protease activation. The final result depends on the balance between the injurious mechanisms (inflammatory mediators, cytokines, ischemia) and the protective mechanisms (mainly nNOS). An imbalance favoring the former will result in serious breakdown of the mucosal barrier and bacterial entry, thereby launching a self-perpetuating vicious cycle, leading to shock, sepsis and, sometimes, death.",
