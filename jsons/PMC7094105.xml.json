            "text": "The temporal dynamics of infectious disease transmission is well documented (Anderson and May, 1991), however, the spatial spread of infection and the mechanisms driving it are less well understood. Spatial dynamics of respiratory diseases has received much attention in recent years following the rapid global spread of both Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (Hufnagel et al., 2004) and pandemic influenza (2009) A(H1N1) (Balcan et al., 2004). Large-scale geographic models are typically implemented by superimposing a transportation network on local infection dynamics (Keeling and Rohani, 2002, Colizza et al., 2006). Smaller scale models often implement reaction-diffusion equations to describe random movements within populations (Noble, 1974, Murray et al., 1986). Such models have been shown to exhibit traveling-wave solutions whose existence depends on the basic reproduction number R\n0 (K\u00e4ll\u00e9n et al., 1985, Mendez, 1998). However, few models address the mode of disease transmission that underlies the spatial dynamics.",

All three modes result from the generation of respiratory droplets by an infected person during an expiratory event (e.g. coughing, sneezing). Droplet and contact transmission require relatively close contact between the infected and susceptible individuals for efficient disease transmission. Therefore, spatial spread via these routes of transmission must be driven by human movement. In contrast, the airborne spread of a pathogen may be attributed to the movement of both people and fine aerosol droplets suspended in the air and their associated airborne residence time and pathogen load. Furthermore, the airborne route is the primary mode of transmission for other respiratory diseases, such as tuberculosis, and its contribution to the spatial spread of infection is of paramount importance.",

Evidence of the airborne transmission of respiratory infections has been documented in hospital ward settings (Wong et al., 2010), housing complexes (Yu et al., 2004) and on board commercial airliners (Moser et al., 1979). In particular, the importance of indoor airflows has been established (Li et al., 2007), with large air flow rates resulting in lower disease transmission (Nielsen, 2009). However, the threshold air velocity above which disease transmission is impaired is as yet unknown. A comprehensive knowledge and understanding of the mechanisms driving such transmission is vital for the implementation of adequate infection controls in indoor public environments such as schools, hospitals and long-term care facilities.",

However, the pathogen-carrying droplets emitted by an infected individual during an expiratory event are the disease vector and the standard models should be adjusted to reflect this. Such models have been used to describe the spatial spread of fungal spores over a vineyard (Burie et al., 2006) and to model disease spread following the point release of an infectious agent (Reluga, 2004).",

            "text": "A zero-dimensional model for the temporal development of an epidemic driven by expiratory droplets (in particular, respirable droplets) was developed in Stilianakis and Drossinos (2010). The model is built on the concept of an infectious cloud surrounding each infected individual, an idea also considered in Eichenwald et al. (1960). In this work we investigate the airborne spread of an infection in a closed spatial environment within which the human population is confined for a prolonged period of time. For example, such outbreaks have been documented in public settings including prisons (Awofeso et al., 2001, G\u00f3mez-Pintado et al., 2010), boarding schools (Rose, 1980), long-term care facilities (Dharan et al., 2009) and on board large cruise ships (Miller et al., 2000, Ward et al., 2010). In the absence of intervention measures, such outbreaks can persist for many weeks. We extend the zero-dimensional model to include the spatial dynamics of airborne-droplet transmission (also known as aerosol transmission) and investigate how an ambient airflow can influence disease spread. Accordingly, we neglect transmission by droplet spray, a close-contact transmission mode that occurs via direct deposition onto a susceptible's mucous membranes, and by (physical) contact transmission. Furthermore, we consider transmission only by respirable expiratory droplets, droplets whose post-evaporation diameter is less than 10\u03bcm, neglecting transmission by inspirable droplets, droplets whose post-evaporation diameter is between 10 and 100\u03bcm. We follow Nicas et al. (2005) and take the droplet post-evaporation diameter to be half the pre-evaporation diameter. Inspirable droplets contribute to disease transmission by inhalation almost immediately after generation (e.g., during the first breath) as they are considerably larger than respirable droplets and they gravitationally settle very fast. As in the case of droplet spray, transmission by inspirable droplets occurs only at close contact.",

In turn, the transmission rate per pathogen \u03b2p is determined from the contact rate c\nd of a susceptible with a droplet and the probability p\nd that such a contact will result in successful transmission \u03b2p=cdpd. In order to derive the contact rate with a droplet we assume that each infected person is surrounded by a droplet cloud with volume V\ncl. It is further assumed that a susceptible individual comes in contact with a droplet through breathing during an encounter with this droplet cloud. If the average breathing rate is B and \u03c4ct is a characteristic time of breathing during the encounter then the contact rate c\nd can be expressed as cd=c(B/Vcl)\u03c4ct, where c is the average number of total contacts a susceptible individual has per unit time. The transmission rate per droplet is thus \u03b2d=cBVcl\u03c4ctpdqdNp0,and the number of pathogens per droplet can be determined by Np0=Vd\u03c1p, where V\nd is the volume of the (spherical) pre-evaporative droplet and \u03c1p is the pathogen concentration of the lung fluid.

Following Stilianakis and Drossinos (2010) the removal rate can be expressed as(11)\u03b1d=\u03b8d+\u03bcp+(1+c\u03c4ct)BVclqd,where \u03b8d is the gravitational settling rate of the droplet and \u03bcp is the inactivation rate of airborne pathogens. Gravitational settling rates are size dependent and we take \u03b8d1=28.8 per day and \u03b8d2=0.39 per day (Drossinos and Housiadas, 2006). This implies that, in the absence of other removal processes, a droplet with diameter d1=4\u03bcm will settle under gravity in a tranquil environment in approximately 50 min. Decreasing the droplet diameter by an order of magnitude results in the droplet remaining airborne for approximately 2.56 days. The pathogen inactivation rate \u03bcp, assumed to be independent of size, is taken to be 8.64 per day (Hemmes et al., 1960) and a droplet is effectively removed through pathogen inactivation in under 3 h. Therefore, pathogen inactivation is a crucial process for the removal of smaller droplets that could, theoretically, take days to settle under gravity alone. Taking both gravitational settling and pathogen inactivation processes into account, droplets remain airborne and infectious for 38.5 min (d\n1) and 2.66 h (d\n2). The inclusion of removal through inhalation, the last term on the right-hand-side of Eq. (11), has negligible influence on these times (removal times of 35 min or 2.46 h for d=d1 or d=d2 respectively) and we approximate the droplet removal rate by \u03b1d=\u03b8d+\u03bcp.",

The dynamics are described by three different timescales (Table 1), two of which, \u03c4r (droplet removal time scale) and \u03c4d (droplet diffusion time scale), are dependent on droplet size. The convective timescale \u03c4c represents the time it takes for the ambient airflow to carry the droplet the entire length of the domain. If l is of the order of 101\u2212103m then typical convection times are \u03c4c=O(102\u2212104)\n s and, clearly, convection is a fast process relative to the disease dynamics with \u03c4c\u2aa1\u03c4t. Intuitively, this implies that lower ventilation velocities, which increase the convection time \u03c4c, result in greater disease transmission. The droplet-removal (droplet infectivity) time scale is the inverse of the size-dependent droplet removal rate \u03b1d with \u03c4r(d1)\u224838.46\n min and \u03c4r(d2)\u22482.66\n h.

In an unventilated environment, \u03bd=0, the larger airborne droplets will be transported by diffusion alone and the uniform state is unstable at all wavenumbers when R0>1 and the infection will spread. In a ventilated environment, \u03bd>0, disturbances with a wavenumber satisfying(15)k<(\u03bb+1)\u03bdR0\u22121=kcritwill be unstable. This result shows that the basic homogeneous disease-free state is stable to short wavelength perturbations (k\u2192\u221e) and only becomes unstable at long wavelengths (k\u21920). The stability diagram is sketched in Fig. 1\n. Clearly, R\n0 must exceed unity for the onset of instability and, for fixed R0>1, the critical wavenumber decreases with increasing \u03bd, which physically corresponds to increasing the ventilation velocity and thereby reducing the time it takes for droplets to traverse the domain. Therefore, increasing \u03bd has a stabilizing effect, by reducing the number of unstable modes that will be amplified.",

            "text": "In an unventilated environment, with \u03bd=0, the spatial spread of disease will solely depend on the diffusion of people or droplets. Droplet diffusion is a slow process, for example a 4\u03bcm droplet will diffuse approximately 5.7 mm while airborne. In the same time a person could diffuse over 7 m. Therefore, the spatial spread of disease will be driven by the diffusion of people as droplets are essentially stationary relative to the human population. Mathematically, this observation follows immediately from the inequality \u03b7d\u2aa1\u03b7p. We first consider the disease spread when a localized infected density is introduced to a uniformly distributed susceptible population. We find that, for small times (t\u223c5\u22483h), droplet density rapidly increases until D(x,t)\u2248I(x,t) and subsequently droplets and infected dynamics are indistinguishable. This occurs once droplet generation and removal processes are essentially balanced. This indicates that there is no separation between droplets and infected individuals and close contact is required for efficient transmission. At larger times the localized infectious peak is observed to grow in amplitude, Fig. 2\n(a). An outbreak in a closed population could be expected to persist for many weeks. However, times in excess of t=2000\u224853 days are unrealistic for an influenza epidemic. At such times the model predicts the formation of two infectious traveling pulses, propagating in opposite directions. Accordingly, the density of susceptibles evolves into a wave front slowly infiltrating the completely susceptible population ahead of the front, Fig. 2(b). There are several reasons why this behavior is observed. Firstly, the idealized case of a homogeneous population, where the infected population is surrounded by a constant source of susceptibles is uncharacteristic of a true human population distribution. In the absence of susceptible individuals the density of infected individuals would rapidly decay, Fig. 3\n. Secondly, once an outbreak is identified within the closed population, interventions such as isolation, quarantine or treatment would be imposed to limit the impact of the outbreak. Diffusion models used to describe the larger scale geographic spread of disease display such traveling wave behavior, with transportation networks simulated using larger diffusion coefficients and timescales of the order of years being considered (Noble, 1974, Murray et al., 1986).",

In the absence of a susceptible population, and since \u03b7p\u2aa11, the density of infectious individuals at any point x=x0 will decay via I(t)=I0(x0)e\u2212\u03bbt\u21920 as t\u2192\u221e. The lifetime of the infected population is thus 1/\u03bb which (dimensionally) corresponds to the disease infectivity time scale \u03c4i of 5 days. The infected population recovers before diffusion has time to effectively transmit the infection, \u03c4i\u2aa1\u03c4p. To conclude, in the absence of an ambient airflow, diffusion is an inefficient mechanism for the spatial spread of disease which will, presumably, be driven by contact and droplet transmission during close contact events.",

However, we emphasize that this is an approximate value obtained for the relatively small diffusion of people and neglecting the possibility of contact and/or droplet transmission. In addition, the true air velocity will depend on the distance from the ventilation source, with larger velocities closer to the source. The unstable evolution of an arbitrary perturbation when v=0.01 m s\u22121 is shown in Fig. 5\n. An infectious pulse can be seen to propagate through the susceptible population in the direction of positive air flow. Droplet and infected densities are qualitatively similar and only slightly out of phase with each other, with droplets propagating ahead of the infectious pulse.

At later times these secondary cases produce droplets of their own and a secondary peak in the droplet curve can be observed, t=500\u224813 days.

At large times, t=1000\u224826 days, it is clear that the amplitudes of both curves for infectious individuals decay. This behavior results from the decay of the initial infectious population through recovery and the subsequent reduction in droplets being convected towards the susceptible region.

Droplet dynamics are governed by generation and removal processes, the latter being dominated by gravitational settling and pathogen inactivation. Inactivation is a particularly crucial removal process for smaller droplets that could remain airborne for days. Smaller droplets are found to be a weak disease vector.

Two initial population distributions were considered: spatially homogeneous or heterogeneous.

This result follows from the observation that the time require for droplets to diffuse is significantly greater than that for humans, \u03c4p\u2aa1\u03c4d. In the homogeneous scenario and for long time scales, the model displays the classic infectious wave propagating through a susceptible population, following an initial transient state until a balance is achieved between droplet generation and removal processes. In contrast, human diffusion is an insufficient mechanism to transmit disease in the heterogeneous scenario, with the infected population recovering before encountering susceptible individuals, \u03c4i\u2aa1\u03c4d. However, the inclusion of ventilation effects and the subsequent transport of droplets from the source of infection can result in a secondary outbreak if susceptible individuals are encountered. This signifies that infection is possible without direct contact between susceptible and infected individuals. Furthermore, it was shown that increasing the velocity above a critical value can impair disease transmission in a homogeneously distributed population as droplets will be rapidly transported out of the domain causing minimal infection since the time required for transmission is large relative to the convective time scale \u03c4c\u2aa1\u03c4t.",
