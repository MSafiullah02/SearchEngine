Thirteen patients developed hepatic recurrence before the appearance of PM with: six undergoing re-resection of the hepatic tumor; transcatheter arterial chemoembolization used for effective control of their hepatic tumors in six; and, the remaining individuals underwent re-resection for the first recurrence and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for the second.",

Surgical resection is the optimal treatment for primary and locally recurrent HCC.8 Once distant metastasis occurs, however, these patients are deemed terminal because an effective systemic therapy is not available. Okusaka et al. reported a median survival of 4.6 months for a sample of 34 patients with metastatic HCC who received chemotherapy, with a 20.3% 1-year survival rate.9 Lo et al. performed surgical resection for 12 patients with metastatic HCC, who had longer survivals compared with another 24 who were treated nonoperatively (52% versus 21% and 26% versus 0% at 2 and 5 years postprimary hepatectomy, respectively).1 Pulmonary involvement was the most prevalent in terms of possible metastatic sites for HCC,4,9\u201311 with PM-ectomy preferred by many authors for intent to prolong survival.1\u20137 Postprocedure survival rates for HCC were analyzed in two reports. Lam et al. reported a 10% 5-year survival rate4 and Nakajima et al. revealed a 23.8% 3-year survival rate.2 In the present report, the survival rate after PM-ectomy was 65.2% at 2 years and 27.5% at 5 years. According to data mentioned here, operative groups appear to have better survival results than historic analogs treated nonoperatively.1,9 However, selection bias is inevitable because patients with good clinical condition are often those deemed eligible for surgical treatment.",

Of the primary tumor factors, high alpha-fetoprotein level (?100), close resection margin (<1 cm) and short DFI (<12 months) were associated with a significant decrease in the overall survival from univariate analysis. Peng et al. also indicated that high alpha-fetoprotein level was a significantly unfavorable prognostic factor in patients undergoing curative hepatectomy of primary HCC.15 Nakajima et al. demonstrated that positive resection margin decreased the disease-free survival but did not affect overall survival.2 In our study, DFI was an independently prognostic indicator from multivariate analysis (Table 2), however, the significance demonstrated by Nakajima et al. was not confirmed.2 These researchers defined DFI as the interval between primary liver surgery and PM diagnosis, however, we suggest that the interval to cancer recurrence (not restricted to lung) can better reflect the aggressiveness of the primary tumor. The shorter DFI is because of the more aggressive biology of the primary tumor, and ultimately determines the poorer overall survival.12,16\u201320 In the present study, DFI remained a significant factor in Cox\u2019s model, where DFI (in months) is taken as a continuous variable, avoiding the bias inherent in adoption of a single, occasionally arbitrary, cutoff value in univariate analysis.",

Additionally, early recurrence may indicate the growth of originally micrometastatic lesions, which cannot be detected by CT scan, or by bimanual lung palpation during operation.

Additionally, analysis of our data did not reveal any difference between the open and thoracoscopic approaches with respect to overall and PM-free survivals. However, the opinion against thoracoscopic approach is largely based on the inability to perform bimanual palpation of the whole lung to detect subclinical lesions missed with traditional CT scan.24 It appears likely that the probability of this false negative finding will decrease as CT imaging technology and related techniques continue their rapid and seemingly inexorable advance. The multislice spiral CT improves nodule detection because the entire lung can be scanned at high resolution during a single breath hold without an intersection gap. Nevertheless, a prospective, randomized comparison trial of the thoracoscopic and open surgery using spiral CT scan to identify lesions preoperatively is needed to settle this debate conclusively.",
