Recently, cities in mainland China and Italy imposed lockdown restrictions in response to COVID-19, which gave us an unprecedented opportunity to study the relationship between seismic noise above 1 Hz and human activities. Using seismic records from stations in China and Italy, we show that seismic noise above 1 Hz was primarily generated by the local transportation systems. The lockdown of the cities and the imposition of travel restrictions led to a ~4-12 dB energy decrease in seismic noise in mainland China. Data also show that different Chinese cities experienced distinct periods of diminished cultural noise, related to differences in local response to the epidemic. In contrast, there was only ~1-6 dB energy decrease of seismic noise in Italy, after the country was put under a lockdown. The noise data indicate that traffic flow did not decrease as much in Italy, but show how different cities reacted distinctly to the lockdown conditions.",

In early to mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, facilitated by increased travel during the Chinese Lunar New Year. With Wuhan being a major rail transport hub in China, the virus quickly spread throughout the country. On 23 January 2020, Wuhan and other cities of Hubei province imposed a lockdown in an effort to quarantine the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak (Lu, 2020) . All public transportation except for emergency and supply vehicles were suspended. A total of 12 other counties to prefecture-level cities in Hubei, including Enshi, the location of one of the seismic stations used in this study, were placed on travel restrictions by the end of 24 January 2020 (Table 1 ). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020. By chance, this outbreak closely coincided with the Chinese Lunar New year of 2020, and the Chinese government utilized this coincidence to facilitate lockdown logistics, essentially extending the traditional week-long national holiday for several months. In Italy, following the rapid expansion of an outbreak of COVID-19 cases in the north of the country in late February 2020, the Italian government imposed a lockdown on many of its Northern provinces on 8 March 2020. The lockdown restricted all movement except for work, health circumstances and essential activities. On the evening of 9 March, quarantine measures were extended to the entire nation, becoming effective the next day. This quarantine included some important differences from the restrictions in China. For example, the lockdown did not apply to the public transportation system, including buses, railways, flights, and ferry services. People with self-declared travel exemptions were permitted to travel. On 11 March 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic. This sudden declaration of a public health emergency provides an unusual dataset in which we can compare changes in seismic noise to the known timings of social orders.",

Long (1971) found that moving vehicles on the freeway generate noise with peak frequency at about 10-20 Hz, and that this signal can be detected within 5-8 km. The station IC.ENH is located ~3 km from the freeway G50 to its southeast (Fig. 1a) . The G50 is a 1900 km long and east-west bound expressway connecting Shanghai, China to the east and Chongqing, China to the west. While we are not yet able to retrieve the record of daily traffic-flow volume on the G50 near city Enshi, traffic data for a segment of this freeway named as Huanghuang east of Wuhan can be accessed (http://www.hhgs.org.cn/) and we use it as the representative of the general traffic flow on this road within Hubei province. The average daily traffic-flow volume on the freeway during the 2018 Chinese Lunar New Year was only 31% less than the daily volume on the regular days (Table 2 ). This suggests that the cultural noise peak in the frequency band 10-20 Hz can be explained by the high-speed cars on the freeway. This is further supported by the back azimuths of the polarization ellipsoids in Figure 3b . The source direction of cultural noise in the 10-20 Hz frequency band is from the southeast (back azimuths are ~ 120\u00b0 -150\u00b0) during the daytime, indicating the noise arrives from the direction of the freeway. The northwest noise source during the night ( Fig. 3c) is probably from the downtown area, which lies in that direction. This dataset also shows a period of freeway traffic control between 13 September 2018 and 26",

Overground rail transportation could generate the seismic noise above 30 Hz in the seismograms (Chen et al., 2004; Boese et al., 2015; Riahi and Gerstoft, 2015; Green et al., 2017) , and the Chinese Lunar New Year is the peak travel season for the railway stations. However, according to our observations, there is a 5 dB reduction in the frequency band 30-40 Hz during this period, suggesting that the noise generated by the rail does not dominate our seismic record, perhaps due to the high attenuation and relatively far distance (8 km).",

For station IC.ENH located in Enshi ( Fig. 5a and 5b) , China, as we mentioned before, we can see the lull caused by the Chinese Lunar New Year in January or February (Fig. 2) . In general, people in Enshi show most activity from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. during the winter. In the summer, people tend to be active for longer, from 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. There is a lunchtime lull year-round at noon. However, for the frequency band 10-20 Hz generated by the traveling cars on the freeway (Fig. 5b) , the lunch-time lull is longer and continues for about two hours during the summer. This may reflect hot noon-time weather in the summer discouraging people from going outside. Interestingly, the Chinese data do not show clear weekly cycles; work and activity continue week-round. In Milan, Italy ( Fig. 5c and 5d (Fig. 8b) . Interestingly, there are four distinct sources in frequency bands 1-2 Hz, 3-8 Hz, 10-20 Hz, and 20-40 Hz for station IV.RMP which located in the ~20 km southeast of Rome (Fig. 8e) . We estimate the first peak in 1-2 Hz ( Fig. 9a) , with a ~5 dB reduction during the 2019 Christmas period, is generated by pedestrians (Alyamkin and Eremenko, 2011) , since we expect fewer pedestrians on the street during the holiday of Christmas. By comparison to the Chinese data, we believe the second peak at 3-8 Hz (Fig. 9b) is generated by the local factories and low-speed cars on the street; this band a ~3dB deduction at Christmas. Finally, the high-speed cars on the freeway and the trains are responsible for the frequency bands at 10-20 Hz and 20-40 Hz respectively, which exhibit a ~2 dB reduction during Christmas (Fig. 8f) . However, there is no obvious energy diminishing during the Christmas holiday for station IV.MONC (Fig.   8d ), in which the noise is mainly from the freeway nearby (Fig. 1b) time shift in the frequency band 10-40 Hz (Fig. 5d) at the time of clock changes is reflective of the fact that this energy is generated by public transportation, such as trains, and buses, which have a fixed schedule. We highlight how cultural noise data reflects nuances in societal behavior in order to illustrate how these data can provide a detailed proxy account of the societal COVID-19 response.",

By comparison to historical data (Fig. 2) , in the 1-8 Hz band the ~12 dB decrease was equivalent to the abrupt cessation of roughly 20 years' worth of urbanization and development activity. In Figure 4a , a weak peak still appears during the lockdown time in the frequency band around 10-20 Hz. This could be caused by the official vehicles and the supply vehicles on the road (Groos and Ritter, 2009; Boese et al., 2015; Chang et al., 2016; Green et al., 2017) . The energy of this peak increases steadily as more vehicles appear on the road from approximately Julian day 70 onwards. Directional analysis of this noise reveals that it mainly comes from the southeast even at night (Fig. 4b and 4c) where the national freeway is located (Fig. 1a) . The systematic increase in traffic as the lockdown eased serves as a natural experiment that we can leverage to better understand the relationship between traffic and seismic noise. Seismic noise generated by pedestrians and local industry is usually in the frequency band 1-5 Hz (Alyamkin and Eremenko, 2011) . On the one hand, the marked decrease of seismic energy in this frequency band during the lockdown period (Fig. 4a ) reflects the many fewer pedestrians and cars on the street. On the other hand, the observation that 1-5 Hz social noise increased ~5 dB in a two week period from Julian days 71 to 85 suggests that Enshi started to gradually reopen much earlier than the official lift of the lockdown. Note that the increase in social noise at Enshi is correlated well with the traffic flow volume at the highway segment 600 km away (Fig. 4d) . It suggests that this gradual reopening is a province-wide activity.",

The first peak seems to be consistent with the local road traffic, and the second peak is consistent with the noise by the nearby railway that is at a distance of about 3 km. A substantial change in noise is observed coincident with the lockdown of Hubei and Lunar New Year. The duration and magnitude of this noise change, when compared to the 2018 record, demonstrates that this change substantially exceeded the 'normal' variation due to the new year holiday, indicating that industry and civilians altered behavior in Mudanjiang in response to COVID-19 despite the lack of formal local lockdown. There was a ~3 dB reduction in the frequency band 5-10 Hz and ~4 dB in the frequency band 10-30 Hz (Fig. 7a) .

            "text": "Station IC.BJT, located in Beijing, shows only the lower frequency cultural noise, in this station mostly at 2-5 Hz (Figs 6c and 6d ). This may be related to site installation: this seismograph was installed in a deep tunnel, which might suppress high-frequency noise (McNamara and Buland, 2004) . This 2-5 Hz cultural noise is likely to be generated by both the road traffic and by pedestrians (Alyamkin and Eremenko, 2011; Boese et al., 2015; Green et al., 2017) . As with other stations, the COVID-19 effects produced a protracted lull in the cultural noise, with a reduction ~4 dB in 2-5 Hz (Fig. 7b) . At this station the duration of the noise reduction was longer, more than 81 days. The return to 'normal' cultural noise levels was much substantially more gradual than at other stations, with a slow increase in amplitudes from Julian day 30 and recovery to early-January noise levels Station IC.QIZ, located on Hainan island, which is famous for its tourism industry during the winter, shows a similar pattern to IC.ENH (Figs 6e and 6f) , with a dominant cultural noise peak in the range 2-20 Hz that seems to include distinct sources in bands 2-8 Hz and 8-20 Hz. This is probably because both stations are closer to the freeways (unlike station IC.MDJ) (Fig. 1a) . IC.QIZ manifests a similar noise variation to IC.MDJ, with a ~30 day lull, followed by a gradual return to 'normal' but still less than the background levels in 2018 over a further ~51 day period (Fig. 7d) . The average reduction is ~10 dB in the frequency band 2-8 Hz and ~8 dB in the frequency band 10-20 Hz. Interestingly, the higher frequency (10-20 Hz) noise at this station seems to recover faster than the lower frequency (2-8 Hz) noise. If the former reflects high-speed vehicular traffic and the latter reflects pedestrian traffic, this staggered recovery may result from civilians feeling safe travelling in their own cars earlier than they feel comfortable walking around.",

Although it was one of the toughest responses implemented outside of China, their lockdown policy was less strict than China. As a result, we might expect traffic noise not to have decreased as sharply as we found in mainland China. We find only ~1 dB of energy decrease of cultural noise in the frequency band 10-40 Hz in IV.MILN and ~5 dB of decrease in IV.MONC after Italy declared its lockdown (Fig. 8) . For station IV.RMP, the energy reduction was ~6 dB in 1-2 Hz (Fig. 9a) , indicating many fewer pedestrians on the street. There is a ~4 dB reduction in the frequency band 3-8 Hz (Fig. 9b) and ~5 dB reduction in the frequency band 10-40 Hz (Fig. 8f) , which implies the decrease in trafficvolume was less than the reduction in foot-traffic. Our observations are consistent with the local lockdown policies. The Italian authorities required that their schools, universities, theaters, cinemas, bars, and nightclubs must be closed. Religious gatherings, including funerals and weddings, and sporting events were suspended or postponed. Restaurants and bars were allowed to be open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., and shopping malls and markets could open on weekdays with a decreased density of patrons. Under such conditions, the cultural noise should be primarily generated by transportation systems. Lack of any decreasing seismic noise across the lockdown timing seems to corroborate the inference that the primary noise source was public transportation, which was not impacted by the lockdown (Pepe et al., 2020) . It appears that the continuous operation of the public transportation system maintained the persistently high level of cultural noise.",

According to our observations, different Chinese cities experienced distinct periods of diminished cultural noise, related to the differing local responses to the epidemic. A marked noise change was found even in cities that did not come under government-mandated quarantine. In contrast, there was only ~1-6 dB energy decrease of cultural noise after Italy was put under a total lockdown, due to continuous public transport. Italian cities seem to be responding differently in terms of social behavior as the lockdown continues.",

Another distinct peak can be identified at high frequencies, approximately in the 1.5-8 Hz frequency band. As we will show, this peak is caused by cultural noise.There is a clear increasing trend in seismic noise in Enshi between 2000 and 2020 whichshows a good correlation with the local economic growth and the number of civil motor vehicles(Figs 2b and 2c). Black arrows inFigure 2ashow the timings of the Chinese LunarNew Year since 2000, correlating well with an annual lull in cultural noise due to decreased traffic flow and closure of factories. The red arrow inFigure 2aindicates the time thatEnshi came under lockdown, resulting in a sudden decrease of cultural noise. We explore the effects of this lockdown by examining vertical component PSDs for the first three months of the year, comparing vertical PSDs between 2018(Fig. 3a)and 2020(Fig. 4a).The 2018 data at this site provide information on various aspects of social life in a regularyear, including diurnal variations, a holiday effect, and seasonal variations (Figs 3a, 5a and 5b",

The peak frequency of cultural noise for IV.MONC generated by the traveling cars on the freeway is ~20-30 Hz rather than 10-20 Hz. We estimate that this difference may relate to the different local geological conditions or simply the different regulations of highway speed limit (80 km/hr on G50 in Enshi, Hubei province in China vs. 130 km/hr in Italy). We note that there is a remarkable difference in the level of cultural noise (1-40 Hz) between IV.MILN, IV.RMP and IV.MONC, as stations IV.MILN and IV.RMP exhibit much higher noise. We believe the reason is that stations IV.MILN and IV.RMP is in an urban area, whereas IV.MONC is in a mountainous area(Fig. 1b). Italy follows the European Summer Time annual Daylight Saving Time procedure setting the clocks forward one hour from standard time during the summer months. In 2019, summer time was from March 31 to October 27. Figures 5c and 5d show a clear time shift of cultural noise energy due to these clock changes. The abrupt",
