            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a severe infectious disease that has affected many countries and regions since 2002. A novel member of the coronavirus, SARS-CoV, has been identified as the causative agent. However, the pathogenesis of SARS is still elusive. In this study, we used 2-D DIGE and MS to analyze the protein profiles of plasma from SARS patients, in the search for proteomic alterations associated with the disease progression, which could provide some clues to the pathogenesis. To enrich the low-abundance proteins in human plasma, two highly abundant proteins, albumin and IgG, were first removed. By comparing the plasma proteins of SARS patients with those of a normal control group, several proteins with a significant alteration were found. The up-regulated proteins were identified as alpha-1 acid glycoprotein, haptoglobin, alpha-1 anti-chymotrypsin and fetuin. The down-regulated proteins were apolipoprotein A-I, transferrin and transthyretin. Most of the proteins showed significant changes (up-or down-regulated) in the progressive phase of disease, and there was a trend back to normal level during the convalescent phase. Among these proteins, the alterations of fetuin and anti-chymotrypsin were further confirmed by Western blotting. Since all the up-regulated proteins identified above are well-known inflammation inhibitors, these results strongly suggest that the body starts inflammation inhibition to sustain the inflammatory response balance in the progression of SARS.",

There were more than 8000 probable SARS cases with 774 deaths reported from 26 countries [1] . A novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV) was separated and identified as the pathogen of SARS by serological and RT-PCR methods [2] . Subsequently, many efforts were made to study the mechanism of infection and the structure of the virus itself [3] [4] [5] . However, there are few studies on the pathological changes in vivo in the affected patients. Plasma is a widely used clinical resource that is closely correlated with disease progression. Analysis of the profile of plasma protein alterations is a promising way to try and elucidate the pathogenesis of SARS.",

In comparative proteomics, the accurate quantitation and the good reproducibility were the basis to provide reliable data. 2-D DIGE is a fluorescence-based technique for protein visualization and quantification, which could compensate the shortage of conventional silver or CBB staining data [7] after 2-DE. Proteins are labeled prior to electrophoresis with fluorescent CyDyes \uf8ea , and differently labeled samples are then co-separated on the same 2-D gel. In this study, we used DIGE to compare the plasma protein profiles among different SARS phases after the onset of symptoms. We found that some proteins showed interesting changes in the progression phase, which might correspond to the pathological state of the SARS patients. ",

Peptide extracts were dissolved in 3 mL matrix solution (5 mg/mL HCCA in 0.5% TFA/ 50% ACN) and 0.6 mL of the solutions were separately spotted onto the ABI-4700 (Applied Bioscience, MA, USA) target plate for MALDI-MS/MS analysis. In the MS mode, the generated ions were accelerated at the source (20 kV) and separated in the first TOF tube. In the MS/MS mode, the parent ion was focused into the gas cell and fragmented using CID. The fragments then were reaccelerated (15 kV) and the m/z values were determined in the second TOF tube. The mass spectral data were submitted to search the Swiss-Prot database by GPS Explore software based on MASCOT search engine (Matrix Science, UK). The proteins with identification probabilities of more than 95% given by MASCOT were considered successfully identified. The peptides whose ion score were greater than 29 were listed, as these could give a good match to the fragment ion mass spectrograph.",

The 2-DE images of the samples of three groups labeled with different cyanine dyes were obtained by fluorescence scanning (Fig. 2 ). The 2-D DIGE images were analyzed by DeCyder 5.0 software to objectively estimate the abundance of proteins in each sample and to generate quantitative data. After setting the proper filter threshold in the software, 703 protein spots were auto-detected. Based on a threshold ratio of 1.5, the software detected the protein spots of interest that showed a significant change among the three groups. Compared to normal plasma, 58 protein spots were up-regulated and 30 down-regulated in progressive group; and 36 protein spots were up-regulated and 21 downregulated in convalescent group. The relative abundance volume ratios of protein spots in each group are shown in Fig. 3 and Table 2 . After scanning, the gels were stained with SYPRO-Ruby and matched with the DIGE image by the software. The protein spots with significant change were picked using a SpotCutter and subjected to in-gel digestion for MALDI-TOF/TOF MS analysis. As the cyanine dye was more sensitive than SYPRO-Ruby stain, some spots in DIGE images were invisible in Ruby image. If spots were blindpicked referring to the matched image, these spots usually failed to be identified due to the low abundance. All the identified proteins are shown in Table 2 . Unexpectedly, most of the proteins have been shown to play a role in inflammation control during the infection. The changes in the identified proteins in different groups can be summarized into three modes (Fig. 3) : (A) alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP), ACT, fetuin and haptoglobin (Hp) alpha-2 chain, which were up-regulated in the group with progressive disease compared to the normal group, before their levels tended to return to normal levels in convalescent group; (B) Hp beta chain, which sustained the high level in both progressive and convalescent phase; and (C) apolipoprotein A-1, transthyretin and transferrin, which were down-regulated in progressive group and then rose back to normal levels in convalescent group. It is interesting that most of these proteins showed larger alterations in the progressive phase and then tended to return to normal levels in the convalescence phase. These results strongly suggest that the function of the altered proteins is closely related with the disease progression.",

Therefore, we investigated these two proteins, fetuin and ACT, using Western blot.

In this study, we used the comparative proteomics technology, DIGE, to demonstrate the characteristic alterations of the plasma proteins in the progressive and convalesce phases of SARS. These alterations were strongly suggestive for an antiinflammatory mechanism in the disease process. Like other acute respiratory viral infections, SARS-CoV induced the activation of immune system [12, 13] . This activation was often excessive in the lungs, causing bystander tissue damage and airway occlusion [14] . A fine balance of the immune system is very important between the ability to clear the virus and the damage to the delicate architecture of lungs [14] . Some studies have reported an inflammatory pathology of SARS [10, 13, 15] , including cytokine dysregulation and immuno-pathological damage. In this study, we found that several plasma proteins changed significantly in the progressive phase of SARS. The up-regulated proteins were AGP, ACT, alpha-2-HS glycoprotein (fetuin) and Hp; the down-regulated proteins were transferrin, transthyretin and apolipoprotein A-I. The changes in most of these proteins consequently regressed in the convalescent phase. All of the altered proteins are APPs, and known to take part in the inflammation control [16] , which implicates the active innate immune responses in infection with SARS-CoV, and suggests that the inflammatory response may play an important role during the disease process. Usually, the virus load falls after 10 days from the onset of symptoms, but the status of patients with SARS still deteriorates [10] , which suggested an excessive immunological response. The up-regulated expression of the presented anti-inflammatory proteins in the progressive phase could play a protective role against the excessive inflammatory response to sustain the defense homeostasis during the SARS progression and improvement.",

ACT is a serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) with target enzymes such as cathepsin G, mast cell chymase and chymotrypsin [17] . During acute inflammation, the equilibrium between blood or tissue proteases and their inhibitors is dramatically disturbed. A massive release of proteases from injured cells and infiltration by neutrophils and macrophages occur locally, which result in an oxidative or respiratory burst. ACT inhibits the action of proteolytic pathways through forming stable complexes with protease to maintain structural integrity of the lower respiratory tract. ACT has also been thought to act as an anti-inflammatory agent inhibiting neutrophil chemotaxis and superoxide production [18, 19] . Moreover, the ACT-cathepsin G complex can modulate IL-6 secretion by lung fibroblast, and create a positive feedback to control the acute phase reaction [20] . In our study, up-regulated expression of ACT was observed, implying its important role in the inflammation control.",

However, we found that it was up-regulated in the SARS patients, which has also been reported by Chen et al. [22] . This could be explained by its role as an immunomodulator. Fetuin influences the resolution of inflammation through enhancing the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages [23] , and antagonizing the deleterious accumulation in lungs, which may cause tissue fibrosis or autoimmunity. Fetuin also opsonizes cationic macrophage-deactivating molecules and suppresses the release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) from stimulated macrophages to control the magnitude of the inflammatory response, suggesting a positive role in the recovery phase of acute inflammatory responses [24, 25] .",

The best-known biological function of Hp is the capture of hemoglobin to prevent both iron loss and kidney damage during hemolysis [32] . In SARS patients, there was high oxidative stress caused by activated neutrophils in lungs. Plasma Hp is thought to be a major antioxidant protection agent against hemoglobin-driven free radical accumulation, which causes membrane lipid peroxidation and vascular endothelial cell damage [33, 34] . Neutrophil respiratory burst activity can be inhibited by Hp [35] . Moreover, Hp has been identified as one of the serum angiogenic factors, and angiogenesis is important for lung tissue repair and promotes the growth of collateral vessels [36] , which could be another reason for sustaining the high level of Hp in convalescence.",

It is not clear why their concentrations decreased in SARS plasma. Although in the past it was believed that the lower concentrations of the negative APPs induced by stressed states were due to a reduced rate of synthesis of these proteins [16] , some studies have shown that the concentrations of some negative APPs decrease in response to infections and inflammation because of an increased transcapillary escape rate and catabolic rate [38] . The balance between the rates of synthesis and catabolism and loss determine the circulation level of a plasma protein.",

This phenomenon suggests that the proteins with different PTMs took part in different pathways in the disease process, which finally caused different changes in the levels of their variants in the blood circulation. For example, a putative role for the variants of AGP is in the altered carbohydrate composition during immunomodulation [39] . The proteins with different PTMs might be specifically associated with SARS-CoV infection. Additional investigations are needed to reveal the nature of the variants and their significance in SARS. Hp is characterized by molecular heterogeneity with three major phenotypes, and consists of two different polypeptide chains named alpha and beta. The sequence differences between the Hp alleles result in amino acid sequence differences of the corresponding proteins only within the alpha chains, whereas the beta chain sequences are identical in all alleles [32] . The different spots of the alpha chains visible in the 2-D gels have been assigned to genetic Hp subtypes [40] . In our experiments, the pooled samples of each group were from several patients with unknown Hp phenotype, so that the inconsistent volume ratios of Hp alpha-2 chain may due to the different phenotype compositions between groups.",
