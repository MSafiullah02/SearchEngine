(Bill Gates, 2016 1 ) Recent transnational disease outbreaks such as Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza, swine flu, and the Zika virus have all demonstrated that diseases do not respect borders and that crisis management strategies require a multi-sectoral and multi-lateral response. Wicked problems come in various forms but a significant contemporary wicked problem for policy makers concerns how to manage disease threats at the animal-human interface. Managing such diseases is a complex process that is underpinned by uncertainty, high risk and requires governmental resilience (Brassett et al., 2013) . The failure to effectively manage the wicked problem of disease-induced crises can result in major costs for society (Connolly, 2015; Geuijen et al., 2016; Head, 2008; Weber and Khademian, 2008) .

(ESRC, 2014) As demonstrated by the post-2014 Ebola crisis in West Africa, minimising the risks of a pandemic requires the need for endemic and entrenched social and economic problems to be addressed. Managing zoonoses is one of the most pressing and complex challenges for modern risk governance given they have acute social, environmental, political and economic implications but they are also shaped by different policy styles across state contexts (Baekkeskov, 2016; Kuetting and Cerny, 2015) . The added challenge is that detection has not been the main focus of disease containment strategies as well as the absence of a long-term and global political commitment for dealing with the 'causes of the causes' of outbreaks (e.g. poor sanitation, habitation, poverty and societal inequalities) (Marmot, 2005) . The risks of transboundary disease-induced crises also needs to be seen in the context of globalisation.

The Chair of Public Health England (and distinguished Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and former Assistant Director-General of the Health Security and the Environment of the WHO), David Heymann, summarises this issue:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The areas of animal and human security policy, and their knowledge networks, are by no means joinedup. Stakeholder interests are divergent and the areas suffer from asynchronous political visions . . . The difficulty is that animal health is to keep animals healthy but the ultimate goal is a profit whereas human health is to keep people alive and healthy. So already there are tensions between the two groups and if you want to sell anything to the animal health community it has to be different to how you sell something to the human health community. (Heymann, 2014emphasis added) It is within this backdrop that there have been calls throughout the animal and public health professions for policy approaches that integrate knowledge across security domains and address vulnerabilities at the animal-human interface. The contribution that this article makes to the academic debate is the development of a conceptual framework for evidencing the level of policy maturity towards a One Health model of health security governance from an epistemic perspective. The relationship between knowledge integration, epistemic communities and health security governance has (to date) not been sufficiently examined. Despite a lack of strategic integration at an institutional level in global health governance, it is clear from some studies (e.g. Leboeuf, 2011; Lee and Brumme, 2013) that there have been shifts in global discourses that indicate a recognition for the need to embed a One Health policy model between the 'tripartite' of the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). A One Health model could, however, be said to be rather utopian but this does not mean that greater integration across policy sectors is not a pragmatic way forward. Geuijen et al. (2016) , in their examination of the public value in global wicked problems (specifically forced migration), call for institutional innovation, and collective discourses, global/transnational connections in order to reframe and address issues of a global concern. Geuijen et al. (2016, p. 6 ) launch a pre-emptive strike against critics who might judge that innovating to solve wicked problems is a 'motherhood and apple pie' issue by noting that '[o] ne can scoff at this analysis and claim that it is simply too simplistic' given that actors tend to function within their own operating environments. The issue of One Health is similar in the sense that the animal and public health professional communities need to make in-roads towards addressing diseases at the animal-human interface and to shape public policy. The article offers a policy analysis of the problematics associated with epistemic integration in the context of global governancealthough the dominant policy domains are naturally immersed in health science studies and this will be clear throughout. In short, this article proposes an evaluative framework for establishing the level of maturity in the emergence and impact of epistemic integration towards a One Health model in context of contemporary health security governance. that both human and veterinary science disciplines can contribute to the development of each other. A key problem is that there has not been the development of a conceptual framework for establishing the extent of progress that has been made towards this modeldespite senior and influential policy actors calling for knowledge to be joined-up across policy areas in order to best mitigate against health security threats (Heymann, 2014 ). An 'epistemic community' of crosspolicy actors (bridging animal and public health security) would be the most significant force for influencing the policy agenda in order to prevent and detect against the manifestation of disease outbreaks. Such a development would serve to increase public health capacities to tackle animal healthinduced crises affecting the human population (Zinsstag et al., 2011) . It would also give much more prominence to integrative conceptual empirical development in health security governance. Lee and Brumme (2013, p. 778) notes that the One Health approach 'has received growing attention over the past decade amongst policy-makers, practitioners and funders seeking more effective prevention, control and treatment responses in an increasingly populous and globalised world'. As the extract from the interview with Heymann earlier in the article highlighted, stakeholder interests within the public and animal health sectors are divergent and these respective domains suffer from a lack of knowledge integration and cohesive political visioning. Further challenges include greater enthusiasm in the animal health community for the concept of a One Health model compared to the public health community; the elasticity of the definition of 'One Health' i.e. the lack of indicators for establishing that it has been achieved; the fragmentation and proliferation of institutions in global governance for health; the challenges of managing international policy relationships (between states and between states and international agencies/organisations); the politics of territorial governance; and capacities and concerns for state sovereignty (in terms of sharing data and information between and with supranational bodies) (Connolly, 2015; Davies et al., 2015; Gibbs, 2014; Lee and Brumme, 2013) . Compounded with this is that the global health environment can be described as 'overpopulated, fragmented and competitive' (Zinsstag et al., 2011, p. 148 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 555, "end": 584, "text": "(Heymann, 2014emphasis added)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1340, "end": 1354, "text": "Leboeuf, 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1355, "end": 1376, "text": "Lee and Brumme, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1830, "end": 1851, "text": "Geuijen et al.

Baum et al. (2017) reflect on 'the effectiveness of One Health?'particularly in terms of whether there are adequate metrics for assessing its levels of efficiencies and call for the need for evaluation. Indeed, specific evaluation activities are underway via the EU funded Network for Evaluation of One Health (NEOH), which include a series of evaluation case studies from a range of territorial/geographic contexts on this basis that these will contribute generating 'rigorous evidence that would motivate enablers (policy makers, public sector, development programmes) and value chain actors to apply methods at the relevant scale' (NEOH). 2 At a meta-evaluation level, however, the analysis of One Health needs to be multi-sphered in that evaluation frameworks are required for assessing the global impacts of joint vaccination campaigns, joint surveillance systems, information exchanges between communities and policy makers, capacity building on monitoring activities, and the effectiveness of the tripartite partnership between the WHO, FAO and OIE (i.e. the collaboration and coordination of global activities and integration of control systems).

Similar to 'One Health' itself, there is an undercurrent of utopianism within the joined-up government literature in that tight integration 'must be a good thing' in symbolic terms but, in fact, it is not without institutional and professional barriers/challenges. The problems of not joining-up may produce political value conflicts (Davies, 2009 ), more opportunities for bureau-politics (Rosenthal and Kouzmin, 1991) ; lack of clarity of ownership and confused lines of accountability (Wilkins, 2002) , and limited preparedness innovate, challenge convention and work in new ways both in an intra-and inter organisational sense (Clarke and Stewart, 1997) . The (perhaps unintended) outcome of 'too much' joined-up government may lead to the dampening of the possibilities for creativity, which can be borne out of a moderately conflictual and competitive environment. More broadly, Ling (2002) notes that aspects of joined-up government entail shifts in governing arrangements that include new accountabilities and incentives (e.g. shared outcome targets); new ways of working across organisational boundaries (including shared leadership and budgeting processes); new ways of delivering services (e.g. joint delivery across sectors and greater scope for consultation with the end user); and new types of organisation (e.g. information sharing, shared cultures and capacity building).

In terms of national and global levels, scholars have considered the importance of global knowledge networks in generating coherence in public policy and for stimulating policy learning and change (Demeritt et al., 2015; Parsons, 2004; Stone, 2004; . The role of knowledge in public policy research has also associated with lesson-drawing, policy transfer, policy diffusion and policy convergence (Bennett and Howlett, 1992; Dolowitz and Marsh, 2000; Nicholson-Crotty and Carley, 2016; Rose, 1991; Stone, 2012) . In this respect, networks of actors are key channels through which learning and change take place. However, less attention has been given to the integration of knowledge between professional or epistemic domains. In terms of knowledge networks, epistemic community research has made the most advances when it comes to considering how networks of expert actors come together in an attempt organise themselves to encourage policy makers to learn from their knowledge (see for example, Adler and Haas, 1992; Dunlop, 2014; Galbreath and McEvoy, 2013; Haas, 1992; Howorth, 2004; Radaelli, 1997; Richardson, 1996; Zito 2001 ). An epistemic community is 'understood as a network of professionals with competence in a policy area on the basis of a shared objective to ameliorate a political problem via the implementation of an agreed measure' (Galbreath and McEvoy 2013: 170) .

Dunlop (2009, p. 289 ) notes that there is very little social science research with regards to 'the variety of ways in which decision-makers actually learn from epistemic communities'. Equally, there has been a lack of research that considers knowledge collaborations between discipline areas, and particularly so within health governance (Valeix et al., 2016) . As Leboeuf (2011) and Lee and Brumme (2013) have argued, the benefit of a shift in health security governance towards a 'One Health' model is to avoid the dangers of policy makers taking piecemeal approaches and to tackle significant threats of the transmissibility of diseases between animals and humans. After all, SARS, pandemic influenza, avian influenza and Ebola, have all had public health implications but their origin have been in animal infections. For example, the most likely explanation for the 2003 SARS outbreak was that the infection came from a civet ('toddy cat') that was the carrier of the coronavirus in a live animal market in a province in South China (Heymann and Dixon, 2013) . The 2009 pandemic influenza outbreak, also referred to as 'swine flu', also had animal health origins in that the virus was a new strain of H1N1 as a result of a triple reassortment of bird, swine and human flu viruses further combined with a Eurasian pig flu virus (Trifonov et al. 2009 ). Avian influenza (particularly the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain), which spread worldwide in 2005, proved to have public health implications (Thorson and Ekdahl, 2005) . The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa was most likely due to the exposure to bat roost and the 2016 outbreak of the Zika virus in Brazil was found to be transferred to humans via Aedes mosquitoes (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016). There is, therefore, no shortage of evidence to suggest that the sources of disease that threaten large scale outbreaks, and risk public health on a global scale, emerge from infections in animals.

It has been said, and it is a fair argument, that there are elements of vagueness of what joined-up thinking across domains might constitute (Dunleavy, 2010) but this necessitates policy researchers to provide frameworks and indicators for making judgements about levels of effectiveness, successes, and failure in public policy. The critical task, in this regard, is to identify how integrative outcomes are being assessed. For epistemic communities, innovation, diffusion, selection, persistence and policy learning are outcomes for determining whether a One Health epistemic community is present. If evidence of knowledge integration is present across these outcomes then this allows for plausible claims to be made about the extent of progress towards One Health. In this respect, Table 2 provides a One Health evaluation framework and the indicators enable an assessment of knowledge integration including an assessment of the shaping of global policy on health security. The content of Table 2 brings into focus the fact that actors from both public and animal health communities need to have the ability to become advocates while, at the same time, have sufficient insider status in order to influence the policy agenda. Moreover, key criterion for success is whether politicians use One Health groups as a 'legimating device' as part of their policy discourse in order to justify policy actions.

As positive as these examples may be they remain regionally-focused. There are opportunities for the WHO to shape its organisational identity in order to become one that is more of a 'networkbuilder' for One Health and to shape global policy responses. A key starting point is to embed One Health within professional education and training and through funded research collaborations. As Galaz et al. (2015, p. 14) argue, based on interviews with medics and veterinarians within the US Centers for Disease Control to investigate the political economy of One Health, such collaborations are essential in order to address the 'legacies of each profession', which result in different power relations and professional hierarchies.

However, diseases are not mindful to support the results of national referenda on leaving political and socio-economic blocs, therefore it is in the interests of territories to continue collaboration on health security within a multi-level and globalised system of governance. At the same time, David Heymann argues that matters of technical public policy relating to health security (e.g. information and data sharing arrangements with supranational bodies) are not devoid of questions about national sovereignty and these can serve to impede knowledge integration. It is not beyond the realms of impossibility that Brexit may serve to politically inhibit global epistemic cooperation for health security governance, or at least result in the reconfiguration of policy relationships. Even before the Brexit result was on the political table, Davies et al.'s (2015) analysis of 'disease diplomacy' in relation to the revision of International Health Regulations for WHO member states (which expands what is expected from states in terms of detecting and containing outbreaks) raised questions about state capacities, political will and sovereignty in global health security. These debates also relate to the extent of the WHO's effectiveness in leading the agenda towards preventative health security governance based on the experience of the 2014 Ebola crisis -as opposed to taking a reactive or 'fire-fighting' crisis management approach (Kamradt-Scott, 2015) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 354, "end": 366, "text": "(Ryan, 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1381, "end": 1403, "text": "Davies et al.'s (2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1978, "end": 1999, "text": "(Kamradt-Scott, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Global governance and the politics of integration"}, {"text": "The problems experienced by the WHO is inextricably linked to the configurations and network structures of global governance for health security. 'Health' in the context of governance may therefore be taken as referring to 'the power relations, decision processes and policing structures operating at the global level that govern healthcare and the social and environmental conditions which shape population health' (Legge, 2016, p. 5) . In security governance terms, the safeguarding of public health can only be safeguarded to the extent to which the order of global governance actors are organised to prevent threats from protecting human and animal health. One solution might be to enhance the democratisation of global health governance and the role of the WHO as a 'metagovernor'. Questions remain about the role of the WHO in enabling deliberative processes that draw together multiple stakeholders and give a voice to communities affected by disease outbreaks. In this respect, ensuring an effective approach to deliberative policy processes for global health security is not just about ensuring that the right sets of interdisciplinary technocratic actors are around the table to inform security approaches and practices, but it is also about how the actor network is widened to enhance the representative claims of the WHO as a major international organisation. The fact that the WHO 'works through multi-stakeholder partnerships' (Legge, 2016, p.7) indicates that more needs to be done to work with multiple stakeholders to facilitate mechanisms for the uploading of bottom-up preferences from communities in an effort to promote global democratisation processes. Indeed, there has been a step-change over the past decade in the 'political support for a trans-disciplinary One Health approach to endemic zoonoses . . . with greater recognition that \"packaged\" interventions that simultaneously address a variety of endemic zoonotic infections that may reduce the risk of disease emergence and re-emergence' (Vandersmissen and Wellburn, 2014, p. 426) . In terms of working with multiple stakeholders, the WHO could shift its institutional identity and capacities to one that of 'metagovernor'. Metagovernance, according to Bevir (2014, p. 31) , refers to the 'governance of governance'. It is also about the style and manner of governing that focuses on how governmental institutions 'set the ground rules and parameters within which network governance emerges and operates' (Flinders and Judge, 2017, p.9 ). Flinders and Judge (2017, p.9) suggest, rightly, that the ultimate test or 'display' of the capacity for metagovernance is 'revealed when governments respond to specific crises or failures by pulling functions, powers and responsibilities back into governmental structures'. Crucially, for One Health, what we have seen to date is a lack of 'metagoverning' on global health security governance and the 2014 Ebola crisis response is a strong indicator of institutional deficits in executing cohesive and cross-sectoral crisis management.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 416, "end": 435, "text": "(Legge, 2016, p. 5)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1441, "end": 1459, "text": "(Legge, 2016, p.7)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2018, "end": 2060, "text": "(Vandersmissen and Wellburn, 2014, p. 426)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2233, "end": 2252, "text": "Bevir (2014, p. 31)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2485, "end": 2515, "text": "(Flinders and Judge, 2017, p.9", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2519, "end": 2549, "text": "Flinders and Judge (2017, p.9)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Global governance and the politics of integration"}, {"text": "The overall argument of this article has been that modern crisis management for health security governance, and the vulnerabilities associated with it, are in no small part due to the source of threats that lie at the animal and human interface. Although this is the case, governmental moves to focus on addressing the causes of infections at the animalhuman interface necessitate considerable development. One Health has risen up the policy agenda considerably over the past decade (Galaz et al., 2015) and it is clear that the 'wicked problem' of diseases at the animal-public health interface will not go way anytime soon. It is therefore in the interest of states and supranational bodies to work together to build capacity to address the ongoing challenges. An aspect of leadership, going forward, should be the commissioning of research by the WHO, in partnership with the UN, FAO, and OIE, to evidence 'the socio-economic value that the One Health approach can provide' (Vandersmissen and Wellburn, 2014, p. 421) . This article has considerable sympathy with the reflections of Vandersmissen and Wellburn (2014, p. 426) (noted below) but it is for international governance organisations, such as the WHO, to provide the global policy culture, narratives and governance leadership that can facilitate less loosely-bound and regionally dispersed epistemic networks:", "cite_spans": [{"start": 483, "end": 503, "text": "(Galaz et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 977, "end": 1019, "text": "(Vandersmissen and Wellburn, 2014, p. 421)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Summary and conclusions"}, {"text": "Long-term institutional approaches to zoonoses management that sustainably strengthen the regional and national institutional base for One Health require a rigorous assessment of governance structures, policy processes and stakeholder networks.

The challenge is to support, build upon and broaden the existing One Health platforms that were established to detect emerging threats, to also encompass the endemic infectious disease burden of communities.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Summary and conclusions"}, {"text": "At a broader conceptual level, there are also future opportunities to consider the relationship between knowledge integration, epistemic communities and the evidence of public value (Geuijen et al., 2016; Moore 2013) . Evaluating the integration of epistemic networks and their role(s) in affecting global policy change should be the focus of future research. Getting to this point, however, is not an apolitical process due to the fact that their respective policy sectors are engulfed by different interests. It is within the context of these challenges that there is a need for One Health education and training programmes in order to temper the impact of the professional legacies. There have been positive developments in terms of the implementation of One Health initiatives as well as international and national funding in order to draw together public and animal health disciplines. There are high levels of veterinary and public health expertise in the UK (the UK hosts world renowned reference laboratories) and there have been efforts to improve joined-up thinking and communication flows between the public and animal health disciplines through HAIRS and across government levels. The EU institutions are also strengthening their capacity for monitoring and evaluation of disease threats. In short, this represents the beginning of a research agenda that aims to evaluate the progress towards cross-disciplinary network-building and extent of policy change towards a holistic model of health security governance. Gibbs (2014, p. 91) argues that over the next ten years 'we will know whether One Health is truly a paradigm shift or a successful, but short-lived, response to a spate of important viral diseases that plagued the world in the early 21st century'.
