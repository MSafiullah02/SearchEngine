These threats are more strongly interlinked than previously thought by their common origins in fossil fuels such as coal, oil, or gas, including that derived from fracking. It is well established that accumulation of anthropogenic greenhouse gases (CO2, methane, and N2O) in the atmosphere is the main driver of climate change. However, policy makers and the general public need to better appreciate the links of each of these threats to life.",

The argument is that not only can these threats be averted, but also by reducing our dependence on fossil fuel usage we can simultaneously mitigate and eventually reverse the current climate crisis and improve environmental wellbeing and human health. If we are to embrace these economic transitions which are so urgently required, a deeper understanding of the interlinked mechanisms is needed. These outcomes can be achieved by investing in alternative energies\u2014eg, solar, wind, or geothermic. Development of these renewable energy sources will in turn substantially reduce biodiversity loss, chemical pollution, and plastic pollution.",

An edifying example of that is the \u201cLittle Ice Age\u201d in the 16th century.8 The conquest of America resulted in an increase in fallow land related to the reduced burning of biomass and pandemics. A direct consequence was that the CO2 in the atmosphere declined by 10 parts per million (ppm) (at present it is around 410 ppm) and temperature decreased by 0\u00b76\u00b0C.9 Currently, the effects of intensive agriculture (use of pesticides and fertilisers) and deforestation are the main drivers of biodiversity loss.6 Unfortunately, climate change is enabling previously inaccessible regions to be exploited for agriculture, often justified by the argument that the growing population needs to be fed.10 Conversion of previously unavailable land to arable land is often referred to as the climate-driven farming frontiers. Unfortunately, arable land, if thawed and tilled, contains readily-releasable carbon (>177 gigatonnes)\u2014as much as the amount of CO2 emitted throughout the 20th century by the USA.10\n",

This combination leads to even greater loss of biodiversity, soil degradation, and more chemical pollution. Solutions to these problems exist: there is no need to go back to tilling or weeding by hand! For instance, robots using alternative-derived energy sources can be expected. Although solutions are readily available, they require strong political support for their application. The industrial sector often threatens large-scale unemployment and governments tend to focus on growth statistics. Yet, increased investment in alternative energies combined with boosting research on more readily biodegradable plastics and less harmful chemicals (including pesticides), will ensure growth and employment, and also provide a better environment for humans and biodiversity. As a result, such pleiotropic efforts will not only reduce climate change, limit biodiversity loss, and reduce health costs from endocrine disruption, but also help attain the United Nations sustainable development goals.",
