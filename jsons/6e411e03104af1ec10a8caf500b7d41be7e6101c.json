From medical schools to residency programs, from patient interactions at home to those in quarantine, virtual communication is providing a safe way to continue with our responsibilities during this pandemic. According to POTUS (17 March 2020), telemedicine, with lessened HIPAA regulations, is now an approved method of communication between physicians and patients for those with Medicare. 1 Telemedicine provides protection to both the physician and patient, preventing possible spread of COVID-19 while allowing for continued patient care. It is now vital to make practical, effective use of telecommunications to stabilize the healthcare system. Recently, medical schools have transferred their curriculum to continue online. With the AAMC recommending a \"temporary suspension of medical students' participation in any activities that involve patient(s)\" virtual education allows for continued development, while still adhering to social distancing. 2,3 Web conferencing has features such as audio-video, screen sharing, large login capacities and chat functions, allowing students and educators to maintain their regular teaching schedule. 3 The use of telecommunications is indispensable to disseminate knowledge and scientific updates and to swiftly overcome the disruptions in scientific conferences and meetings. Telecommunication and virtual learning can provide medical education and training for those with adjusted or challenging schedules due to the demands of the pandemic. 3,4 Virtual learning not only can be but should be utilized for morning report, sign-out, M&M, and communicating with staff in high risk areas without fear of increasing risk of COVID-19 exposure. Social distancing does not need to be at the expense of effective communication, which itself is fundamental to address this crisis efficiently and effectively.",

The result of this global pandemic includes the closing of schools and childcare centers. The lack of childcare for healthcare workers can result in severe disruption in the healthcare workforce. Without childcare, healthcare teams are further reduced which strains the healthcare system. 6 To combat this, many institutions set up online forums for healthcare workers to find childcare. Our ability to control this pandemic relies on the strength and availability of our healthcare teams. If our team members are unable to employ proper childcare, then there is less healthcare workers to provide patient care and therefore there is a decreased fighting force.",
