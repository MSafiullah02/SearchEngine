In history, the competition has resulted in the rise of a super power as well as the disappearance of another. In the 21st century, the competitive advantage of a country depends not only on substantial power such as military force and economic strength, but also on soft power such as systems, strategy and culture. A balanced system, scientific strategy and appropriate culture will produce talents, advanced technology and a developed economy, which enhances national comprehensive strength to provide a country with solid power to maintain its appropriate international status. Thanks to correcting development strategies, some countries once with a weak industrial foundation and a large population have grown into world-class software bases. Owing to suitable development, East and Southeast Asia's economic miracles often happen in countries which are lacking in resources. Conversely, some countries' economic collapse may be due to too much emphasis on heavy industry and ignorance of the needs of light industry development. To analyze the financial crisis spreading around the world arising from economic imbalance, the problems lie in excessive development of finance, securities and real estate.",

No sooner had the concept of e-commerce appeared than developed countries responded immediately and formulated strategies that could cope. At the same time, both developing countries and regions were keenly aware of the essential role of e-commerce and put e-commerce on the agenda of state construction. Many of them highly expect e-commerce to boost their new domestic economy and realize economic recovery. As mentioned above, the prospects of a nation are closely related to the orientation of its e-commerce.

In the petrochemical industry, there were Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Tang Fei, respectively ranked the second, fifth and seventh amongst the Fortune 500 in 2009. In the retail industry, the United States has the world's largest retail company Wal-Mart, whose revenues reached $405.6 billion in 2009. In the auto industry, General Motors and Ford are both world-wide renowned brands. The U.S. financial industry is also well developed. Bank of America, Citibank, Berkshire Hathaway and JP Morgan Chase at the beginning of the 21st century, including the second generation of the Internet plan, the supercomputer of 1,000 trillion calculations per second, the development of future chips, access to the Internet at school and so on. The implementation of these plans greatly speeded up the development of the information industry of the United States, greatly increased network speed, memory speed and memory size of the chip and computer applications. Militarily, the United States set the goal of applying artificial intelligence to the military. Then, robots would fight on a battlefield instead of soldiers and computers would replace the co-pilot of a fighter. The plan of 20 G FLOPS (20 G Floating-Point Operations per Second) put forward by NASA was one of those plans. In television, the United States was the first to promote the advent of digital television. In 1991, the U.S. government determined to abandon the traditional analog TV technology and to develop the digital TV technology. In 1996, the government promulgated the technical standard for digital TV. In April 1997, the U.S. government gave up revenue of about $70 billion to offer a free digital TV broadcasting license and determined to abandon analog broadcasting in 2006. In the development of mobile phones, the United States did not follow the idea of Europe, and decided to adopt CDMA which was more advanced than GSM as its mobile phone standard. CDMA not only made more efficient use of channels, but also had the potential to directly interact with multimedia and computers. Although, at the turn of the 21st century, the slowdown of the information economy hindered the development of information technology, it was still one important part of U.S. scientific and technological strategy. In 2000, the government invested $850 million in information technology and telecoms and provided $110 million to develop the second generation of the Internet, which established the material foundation for the development of e-commerce. In 2003, the Bush administration increased the expenditure on computers, software and technical services from $49.8 billion in 2002 to $58.1, up by 17%. Soon after President Obama took office in 2009, he signed the \"American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009\", which introduced a stimulus package with a total amount of $787 billion. Obama thought America's advantage in the Internet was being lost and the most advanced and modern information infrastructure needed to be developed as soon as possible, in order to support medical information, the smart grid, education, and broadband. An amount of $7.2 billion was supposed to improve the broadband access network, particularly in remote areas. The specific measures included: developing the next-generation broadband network to meet the needs of business and communication in the 21st century; encouraging cooperation between public and private sectors to popularize the network applications especially at school, at home, in libraries or hospitals; encouraging the diversification of the media to weaken the monopoly and encourage innovation; providing more free and responsible information for children and providing effective tools for parents to protect their children from exposure to undesirable information.",

In 2002, IBM brought in the concept of e-business on demand, thinking that e-commerce should change according to the features and development trend of different industries. E-commerce services became popular. In 2008, IBM introduced the concept of the smart planet which meant embedding sensors into all kinds of materials and forming the Internet of goods. Then the Internet of goods would be connected with the Internet to realize the integration of human society and the physical system. Once the smart planet was launched, the concept has been widely accepted by the world and has been a new development trend of e-commerce in the United States. The smart planet focuses on the whole business ecosystem. It not only includes enterprises, but also the government, communities and so on.",

During the Clinton administration, the U.S. government achieved a financial balance, even a surplus. The other reason is that e-commerce was just in its infancy in the Clinton period. At that time, there was almost no law or policy about e-commerce. In order to ensure the smooth development of e-commerce, a number of strategic policies and laws relative to e-commerce were needed. There were no obvious changes in e-commerce after President George W. Bush took office in 2000, partly because the government had been busy fighting against terrorism since 9/11. The other reason was that the related strategy, policy and legal framework had been created in the Clinton period. So it remained to implement the strategy according to the existing problems. There were no other specific policies for e-commerce after President Obama took office in 2009. However, Obama launched an economic stimulus package with a total amount of $787 billion, which would provide a good macroscopic environment for the development of e-commerce.",

So the government emphasizes the marketing of e-commerce and the leading role of private enterprises in the development of e-commerce. Meanwhile, self-regulatory industry standards and a proper institutional environment are needed. In addition, it is necessary for the government to establish proper relative laws and regulations, tax policy, electronic payment systems, intellectual property protection, information security and telecommunications technology standards. Now there are a set of operable standards and relatively satisfactory legal system. For example, President Clinton promulgated the Internet Tax Freedom Act in October, 1998, stipulating Internet access taxes were exempted for three years. In June 2000, the House of Representatives passed the Electronic Signatures Act, stipulating the electronic signature had the same legal effect as a written signature.

To this end, the government took the lead in the implementation of an online tax-free policy. Meanwhile the government advocated exempting the online tax all over the world. In May 1999, President Clinton persuaded other counties to support the suggestion of a permanent tax-free regime in e-commerce at the WTO Ministerial Conference. Although there were all kinds of concerns, 132 members still signed the Declaration on Global Electronic Commerce, stipulating tariffs in all kinds of online trade would be exempted for at least one year. Later the period was extended several times, which effectively stimulated the enthusiasm of U.S. enterprises to develop e-commerce business and further promoted the development of e-commerce.",

In fact, the Uniform Commercial Legal Framework gained widespread support from developed countries no sooner than the framework was introduced and became the basic principle for global e-commerce legislation and policies. In December 1997, the EU and the United States issued a joint declaration on e-commerce and reached an agreement on the establishment of \"duty-free cyberspace\". In May 1998, 132 members signed the Declaration on Global Electronic Commerce. Later, OECD countries accepted the proposal of tariff exemption. Meanwhile, the WTO approved the principle. In February 1999, the EU proposed establishing an international charter on coordinating global communication, especially in e-commerce. In addition, Japan and the United States issued a joint statement. In the joint statement, the two sides identified the common basic principles on tariffs, taxes, privacy, identity, etc. and emphasized the importance of cooperation in e-commerce.

In 1994, the U.S. government proposed to build the Global Information Infrastructure (GII) to connect the whole world through satellite communications and a telecommunications cable network, forming the sharing mechanism and promoting the sustainable development of the world economy. \"The information superhighway\" construction has provided enormous economic and social benefits. During the first phase of the information highway construction, its success has brought great economic benefits and economic advantages for the U.S. economy during ten years.

Many new Internet-based companies and traditional producers of goods and services are committed to transforming their business processes into e-commerce processes to lower costs, improve customer service, and increase productivity. According to the Census Bureau of the Department of Commerce (Table 2. 2), U.S. e-commerce sales in 2009 reached $3.4 trillion, up from $2.8 trillion in 2007 with a growth rate of 20%. E-commerce key sectors could be divided into B2B and B2C. B2B included the manufacturing business and merchant wholesales business while B2C included retail sales and selected services. B2B was still the main part of e-commerce in U.S., accounting for 91.2% of total e-commerce transactions in 2009. E-commerce transaction volume in manufacturing sectors reached $1.86 trillion, accounting for 55.2% of total manufacturing revenues in 2009. The transaction volume of the merchant wholesale was $1.21 billion, accounting for 35.9% of the total sales in 2009. B2C only accounted for 8.8% of total e-commerce transactions in 2009. The e-commerce transaction volumes in the retail and selected services were $145 billion and $153 billion respectively, accounting for 4.3% and 4.5% of total sales. Compared with revenues in 2008, total revenues and B2B e-commerce revenues declined because of economic depression. But retail e-commerce still increased in 2009 because people preferred to shop online for cheaper and more convenient purchase items. Fig. 2 .1, we can see e-commerce in B2B and B2C has grown steadily since 2002. Only in 2009, there was a slight decline. But B2B declined faster than B2C because of the financial crisis. There was some rigid demand which would not vanish even in the financial crisis, especial basic demands such as food and clothes. People preferred shopping online for cheaper goods so that B2C was still strong. Comparing e-commerce in B2B and e-commerce in B2C, we can see B2C grew faster. B2C in 2008 was over three times as much as that in 2002 while B2B in 2008 was just twice as much as that in 2002. During these years, the U.S. e-commerce in B2C increased steadily in total. Even in 2009, the distribution of e-commerce in B2C still increased from 7.7% in 2008 to 8.8% (Fig. 2.4) . It can be seen e-commerce played a greater role in the financial crisis. The retail industry was one of the most important parts of B2C. From Fig. 2 .5, we can see e-commerce in the retail industry increased in total although there was slight decline in 2006 and 2008. In addition, the U.S. population that can access the Internet was estimated to be more than 205 million in 2010, accounting for more than 66% of the total population of the United States. At the same time, Forrester Research, an authority on e-commerce research, released a report entitled US E-Commerce: 2005 to 2010, which forecast and analyzed the trend in e-commerce in the United States over the next five years. Forrester forecast that the online retail sales in the United States in 2010 would increase to $329 billion. Moreover, online tourism would be the biggest sector in all areas of online sales [2] . According to another famous authority in e-commerce research in the United States, customer satisfaction with the e-commerce sector began to rebound in 2009, with a year-on-year increase of nearly 2%. The growth brought the aggregate score for the sector to 81.4, nearly matching its 2007 pre-recession high of 81.6. All scores reported were using the 100-point scale of the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) [3] .",

In 1967 the Merger Treaty created a single set of institutions for the three communities, which were collectively referred to as the European Communities (EC). In March 1979, the EC formally established the European currency system which laid a foundation for the European single currency. In 1985, the Schengen Agreement led the way toward the creation of open borders without passport controls between most member states and some non-member states. In 1986, the Single European Act was signed, an agreement to dismantle barriers to internal trade at the end of 1992. On December 9 1991, the EC held a special summit and signed the \"European Economic and Monetary Union Treaty and Treaty of the European Union\", that is \"the Maastricht Treaty.\" On November 1, 1993, the Treaty of the European Union was approved by all members and came into force. The European Community was formally renamed the European Union (EU). Since then, the single market has been established.

As early as 1957, the Japanese government passed the Electronic Industry Promotion Act, aimed at electronics and \"micro\" technologies. To enable Japan to take the lead in the development of the micro-chip industry, they have taken the following strategy: Introduced advanced key technologies from the West, made appropriate improvements and sold at a higher price in the domestic protected market. Then, they penetrated the overseas market at lower prices, with leading critical components and chips sold in large numbers. When they occupied a particular market share, they raised prices of the critical components and more advanced products to foreign consumers and earned high profits.

The second measure was to establish a large number of multinational research institutions. Japanese companies set up 224 research institutes in the United States, more than any other country. Japan also signed a wide range of bilateral scientific and technological cooperation agreements with other countries, in which the Japan-US Science and Technology Agreement planned cooperation in 50 projects in 1991 alone.

Compared with the e-Japan, u-Japan has achieved a new leap forward. For example, in broadband, u-Japan not only has promoted the development of the broadband infrastructure, broadband technology is also proposed as a useful tool in life and industry, creating an environment in which the seamless way is used in the wired and wireless Internet. In addition, u-Japan also proposes to use ICTs to solve social problems. In e-Japan, Japan had proposed the goal that 30 million families could achieve high-speed Internet access and 10 million ultra-high-speed Internet access.

In the specific measures there are many strategies deserving concern. For example, in the building of e-government, the setting up of a chief information officer (CIO) by amending the law, to be responsible overall for e-government and administrative reform, and equipping a team of experts to help explore new mechanisms to promote e-government. Widespread implementation of the \"National Electronic Personal-Mail\" will mean people can access and manage tax information, pension records, military service documents and personal health insurance information and other information related to various administrative matters. In addition, i-Japan plans to further improve the digital infrastructure, making an ultra-high-speed broadband upgrade to \"fixed broadband speeds up to Gb-class and a mobile broadband speed of 100 Mb-class\".",

However, when it came to the 1990s, a big reversal happened. The information industry in the United States was booming and the economy kept growing rapidly. Because of a bubble the Japanese economy burst, the banks' had bad debts and other issues. The Japanese economy has been in the doldrums and that has resulted in a \"lost decade.\" Japan had been unable to shake off the recession following the deflation which appeared in 1991, while in the United States the so-called \"new economy\" represented by the information industry grew up and a number of information industry giants such as IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Cisco, Lucent, Amazon, AOL, Yahoo, Google etc. were born. The new economy stimulated robust U.S. growth for 10 consecutive years, while Japan lost its drive. After ten years of development, the United States once again had flung Japan far behind.",

Based on such a clear understanding of the huge gap, the Japanese government proposed the \"Construction of a High Degree of Information Society\", and this quickly evolved into the strategy \"support Japan by the Information Industry\". In this case, the focus on the application of information technology gradually shifted to e-commerce. The development of information technology almost needs no materials to be imported, only a need to use local resources, and this has avoided the disadvantages of limited resources, to the advantage of Japan. So Japan, following the United States, has developed its own e-commerce development strategies. From 1996, the Japanese government began to increase investment in IT, from 1.3 trillion yen in that year to 1.7 trillion yen in 2000. Under the impetus of the government, the investment from the private sector is even much greater, 7 times more than the annual government investment. The Japanese government shifted the focus of development to the information industry. The Japanese government in 2000 launched Digital Japan Beginning-the Action Plan, and e-commerce strategies had begun in Japan. The action put forward directional suggestions from the national strategy, including networking, broadband services, mobile communications, image networks, electronic commerce and so on. In July, 2000, the Japanese government decided to establish an IT Strategic Headquarters, to comprehensively promote the IT revolution, in the difficult circumstances of economic structural reform, pinning the hope of Japanese revival on IT and e-commerce.",

According to the analysis of Euromonitor and McKinsey, revenues of e-commerce would grow at around 10% annually from 2010 [13] . Online shopping in Japan grew by 22% between September 2008 and September 2009. This increase in online retail is happening for a number of reasons. Firstly, people paid more attention to the convenience and price rather than the security and privacy in the midst of the global recession. In addition, the recession brought strong attention to old and antiquated business models that were no longer going to work. Online retail offering cheaper overheads, cheaper marketing costs, and a growing global customer base soon became a popular business model. Amazon Janpan,Rakuten and Yahoo Japan are all the leading e-commerce players in Japan. Among them, Rakuten is the greatest e-commerce enterprise in Japan. Rakuten has pursued a \"shopping mall\" strategy, providing all the services that enable merchants big and small to set up digital shopfronts, including hosting their sites, broking their advertising and processing their payments. This greatly simplifies things for both seller and buyer. There are around 90 million Internet users among Japan's population of 130 million; a massive two-thirds use Rakuten. Online retailing, though growing fast, remains small in Japan at a mere $30 billion a year in sales (excluding digital downloads and travel), but Rakuten handles nearly one-third of all transactions. Now the company is using its strength at home to go abroad. Rakuten has closed a transaction to acquire a 75% stake in Ikeda, a leading provider of e-commerce services to many of Brazil's largest retailers [14] .",

The tremendous potential of online transactions in convenience stores was gradually realized, thus Network Enterprises, a traditional logistics company, turned its eyes to convenience stores. The relationship between convenience stores and a comprehensive trading company was transformed into a new partnership which is based on e-commerce. Since the end of 1999, Network Enterprises constantly combined their business with that of convenience stores to compensate for inconvenience caused by low credit popularity and business discontinuity caused by the consignee being absent. Secondly, putting the digital sales terminals for music and games into convenience stores could increase the sales and meet the demands of customers, and also remove a customer's worries about online payment.",

By combining realistic nets with electronic networks, the transactions provided by convenience stores are almost unlimited. In November 1999, Seven-Eleven's took the lead in providing a \"collection on delivery\" service, then taking advantage of the Internet and multimedia terminals in the store to sell products related to music, video, games content and online sales service. As the convenience stores became the focus of e-commerce, many existing commercial networks such as filling stations and professional corporate chains also began to explore the possibility of a network gateway. In 2001, Japan Post lengthened its business hours by 3 hours and had ATMs distributed in 37 main post offices operating all over the nation.

The foreign trade volume was U.S. $2.97 trillion in 2010 [15] . It shows that China has become a huge trading nation with certain competitiveness. But China highly depends too much on foreign trade and the domestic consumption is not sufficient enough to support sustained and rapid economic growth. In addition, the GDP per capita was just U.S. $4,283 in 2010, ranking it 95th. In order to stimulate the domestic demand, the government has introduced a large number of policies such as heightening the threshold for individual income tax and \"sending electronic appliances to the countryside\". To fight the financial crisis, the government has taken various measures to reduce the negative impact that the financial crisis may bring such as economic contraction, high unemployment rate. In monetary policy, the government implemented a loose monetary policy such as buying and selling securities on the open market as a way of softening the blow. Since July 2008, the central bank has suspended the three-year central bank bills and reduced the frequency of one-year and three-month central bank bills to lead the proper decline of the banknote discount rate and ensure liquidity. In addition, the prime rate and deposit reserve ratio declined three times relatively in September, October and November 2008, which aimed at increasing the money supply and expanding investment and consumption. Meanwhile the central bank was no longer applying hard constraints to the lending plans of commercial banks and encouraged the financial institutions to increase the loans for quake reconstruction, the \"three rural issues\", small and medium enterprises (SMEs). In the international balance of payments, the government increased the export rebates and maintained the currency exchange to sustain the competition in exports. In fiscal policy, the government launched a plan of public spending with the amount of 4 trillion RMB to boost domestic demand. At the same time the government reduced the burden on enterprises through the adjustment of labor law-related measures and increased the expenditure in social security to maintain the stability of the socio-economic development environment. Through these active and effective measures above, China successfully achieved the often stated target of GDP growth of 8%, but negative effects of these measures, such as severe inflation, repetitive construction etc., have emerged.",

In addition, dozens of Chinese products exported to other countries have been subjected to antidumping proceedings.

According to WTO statistics, there were 73 cases of anti-dumping investigation and 10 cases of countervailing duty investigation against China in 2008, relatively accounting for 35% and 71% of the total number of the corresponding cases all over the world.

This is because the information industry just provides information services, but the major consumption is provided by the traditional industrial products such as clothing, food, housing and tourism. The relationship between the information industry and traditional industry is not absolutely contradictory but dialectically unified as they supplement each other. The luxury consumption of hi-tech millionaires needs to be satisfied by the production of traditional industries. Thus the rapid development of the new economy can promote the development of traditional industries from the aspect of demand. Meanwhile the information industry provides the services such as information collection, information storage and information processing which are needed by any industry. Information technology makes machine handling easier and takes less time than manual handling. Therefore information management based on computers can cut the management costs whether inside an enterprise or among the enterprises and improve the productivity of traditional industries.

For the past 13 years, as the closest connected business with the manufacturing area, the circulation of the national economy and service industries, e-commerce had not only developed itself to be a large industry, but has also facilitated the transformation and upgrade of the manufacturing industry, and the service industry of the national economy to a great extent. There were 12,282 e-commerce websites of a certain scale in China by June, 2009, among which the number of B2B e-commerce service companies was 5,320 ( Fig. 2.7) while the number of B2C, C2C and other non-mainstream companies was 6,962 ( Fig. 2.8 ). The figure below described the increase in e-commerce service companies between 1997 and 2009. It could be found in the figures that from 2002 to 2009 B2B e-commerce websites in domestic industries increased substantially and rapidly. In particular B2C, the C2C category and e-commerce websites of other patterns developed rapidly in 2004 and 2008 respectively, which had a close relationship with the awareness of netizens to shop online after the 'SARS period' and the idea of shopping online to reduce costs in the financial crisis [12] . E-commerce companies in China are mainly located in the Yangtze River Delta area, Zhujiang Delta area, Beijing and other developed provinces and cities. According to B2B.toocle.com (Fig. 2.7) , the Yangtze River Delta area accounted for 33.52%, the Zhujiang Delta area accounted for 32.04%, and Beijing for 8.86% by June, 2009. Hangzhou City in the Yangtze River Delta area is acknowledged as the 'e-commerce City of China'. Most of these places have a well developed economy, huge government support, which forms a good matching industrial environment for the development of e-commerce. E-commerce firms are mainly located in the industries closely related to our daily life such as the textile and clothing industry, the digital and home appliance industry. The two accounted for 14.32% and 10.35% in the whole industrial distribution of e-commerce firms respectively while iron and steel machinery, chemicals and pharmaceutics, building materials, agriculture and forestry, ironware, package printing, food, candy and wine, gift items, and other industries accounted for 8.3%, 6.35%, 6.2%, 5.89%, 4.53%, 5.42%, 4.3%, 3.69%, 30.65% respectively [16] . Meanwhile, the revenue of e-commerce firms has increased dramatically. By With the development of e-commerce, the number of employees in e-commerce also increases fast. There were 0.5 million people directly involved with e-commerce services in China by June, 2009 [17] . Besides, e-commerce has promoted the development in the areas of network basic services, warehouse logistics, payment channels, network marketing, network advertisements and other extended industries or Internet areas. Those employees indirectly driven by e-commerce were more than 6 million.",

Australia has set up the Infrastructure Assurance Advisory Council, Critical Infrastructure Advisory Council and three IT Expert Advisory Groups -IT Security Expert Advisory Group, Critical Infrastructure Protection Future Group and the Security Environment Building Experts Group about the aspects of information safety since 2003. Meanwhile the Australian Government established an Australian High-Tech Crime Centre and the National Authentication Framework. With the network being more and more popular, the Australian government not only improved the technology of network security, but also improved the security of e-commerce by popularizing the knowledge about network security among the public. In 2010, the Australian government proposed the \"National Network Security Week\" with the purpose to improve people's awareness of network security, presenting how to protect personal information through some examples about protecting personal online information.",

            "text": "z Consumer engagement in e-commerce The majority of Australians have engaged in a wide range of e-commerce activities online. According to a survey by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), there were 88% of household Internet users who had performed one or more e-commerce activity during June and November 2009. A wide range of e-commerce activities had been adopted by Australians such as banking transactions online, paying bills online, selling products or services online, purchasing products or services online, getting government services online and gambling online. Among them, banking transactions, purchasing products or services and paying bills online were the most popular e-commerce activities (Fig.  2.11 ). In the survey, 26% of Internet users performed between one and three activities while 43% between four and six e-commerce activities, and 18% between seven and nine activities. About 1% indicated they had performed more than ten kinds of e-commerce activities. It can be seen nearly two-thirds of respondents undertook at least four different kinds of e-commerce activities. Meanwhile the age, gender, household income, level of education and employment all had an effect on people's adoption of e-commerce activities. In general, young consumers with high levels of education and income are more likely to adopt e-commerce. Consumers between 25 and 34 in Australia were the main group across age groups. In addition, the higher the levels of education and income, the more likely it is for consumers to engage in e-commerce. Moreover, males (74%) were more likely than females (65%) to purchase online. But they purchased different goods. Males preferred to purchasing household goods including furniture, electronic appliances or computers while females preferred to purchasing health and beauty products. As far as goods and services purchased online are concerned, the most popular items were goods and services, accounting for 56%. 43% of respondents purchased entertainment events, concerts and movie tickets online because of the convenience and low cost. In addition, household goods, books and magazines were also popular goods purchased online. Over a third of respondents chose to purchase them online. E-government services were one of the popular services online too [17] . Details are shown in Fig. 2 .12 [18] . According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the value of Australian business Internet orders was estimated to be Australian $123 billion in the 12 so many people purchased online were the convenience and low cost of e-commerce. In addition, e-commerce made it possible for consumers to purchase goods or services overseas, which was more convenient than shopping abroad. With the development of e-commerce, more and more SMEs use the Internet for procurement. In 2001, SMEs used the Internet mainly for looking for information on products or services. Recently, more and more SMEs used the Internet for placing orders for products or services, and paying for products or services. In addition, medium size businesses adopted e-commerce better, compared with small businesses. In 2010, 79% of medium size businesses placed orders online and 81% of medium size businesses paid for products or services online while only 73% of small businesses placed orders online and 76% of medium size businesses paid for products or services online (Table 2. 3). The most common online purchases made by SMEs were airline bookings, accommodation, software, and stock and merchandise.",

The proven oil reserve is 13.34 billion tons, accounting for 9.5% of the world total and ranking fifth in the world. The proven gas reserve is 6.06 m 3 , also ranking fifth in the world. Its national economy mainly depends on petroleum extraction and the petrochemical industry. The petroleum revenue accounts for more than 85% of government revenue. Behind the guidance of the petroleum industry, other industries, especially the processing industry including liquefaction of natural gas, aluminum metallurgy, plastics manufacture, building materials, garment and food processing account for a considerable proportion of GDP. In addition to the petroleum industry, the main industries in the UAE include food and beverage processing, textile and garment processing, timber processing and furniture manufacture, paper products manufacture, the chemical industry, nonmetallic minerals processing, steel processing, metallurgical industries and jewelry manufacture. In recent years the total investment in industrial projects has reached nearly U.S. $10 billion.",

Each emirate maintained a fragile tribal economy through picking up and selling pearls. The first oil exploration agreement was signed between Abu Dhabi and the Occidental Petroleum Corporation in 1936 and the first batch crude oil cargo was exported from Abu Dhabi in 1962. A substantial transition from a tribal economy to a petroleum economy was finished during this period. During the early 1970s, a great change had taken place in the world petroleum market, featuring the shift from a buyer's market to a seller's market. The UAE and other OPEC members entered a new stage during which every member can control its petroleum industry and sets the export price of oil independently. On December 2nd, 1971, the UAE was formed. In the same year, due to political benefit and war factors, Arabic oil producing countries began to hike the price of oil. The price of light crude oil increased from $3 per barrel to $10.46 in 1974 and reached $11.51 in 1975. Meanwhile, oil consumption throughout the world grew from 49.16 million barrels per day in 1971 to 57.15 million barrels per day in 1973. In this favorable market environment, the oil revenues of the UAE reached 25.5 billion dirham in 1974. After the first oil crisis from 1973 to 1975, OPEC decided to increase the oil price to $25 per barrel in 1978. In 1980, Iran and Iraq, as two main petroleum exporting countries, slid into war, leading to sheer panic in the worldwide petroleum market. In 1981, thirteen members of OPEC held a meeting which decided to set the standard oil price at $34 per barrel. This event triggered the second oil crisis. The considerable increase in petrol prices delivered a heavy blow to western countries, but created a great opportunity to OPEC members for the blooming of their national economies. According to IMF, the GDP of the UAE was only 1.5 billion dollars in 1972, but after only nine years it increased to 32 billion dollars. The GDP per capita increased from $4412 in 1972 to $30,198 in 1981, up 24% year-on-year, making the UAE the richest country in the world. However, when it reached $34 per barrel, the highest point, the oil price began to decrease due to a slump in demand and implementations of new low-energy consumption materials. Although OPEC adopted the strategy of limiting production for turning around the decline, the oil price fell below $10 per barrel. As a result, the economic development of the UAE faced some challenges.",

According to the design planning, network universities, software development centers, e-commerce transaction centers, electronic products industrial parks, computer accessories and other related assembly area network industries would gradually be improved in the e-commerce free zone, and the world's largest commercial IP phone network would be built in this region. The Network University being constructed would become the world's first Internet university, providing e-government, e-finance, e-market, multimedia, e-management, and correlative education to train more e-commerce professionals for the Middle East [27] . By 2007, the trade area had attracted more than 400 registered companies, including Microsoft, Oracle, MasterCard International, IBM, Dell, Cisco, Siemens, Compaq, Emirates International Bank and other major companies engaged in e-commerce. There were more than 5,000 managers here, and staffs reached a total of more than 8500. Another 350 companies were applying for business licenses in this network city. Experts believed that Dubai e-commerce free zone would play a positive role in maintaining and strengthening the regional trade hub of Dubai and increasing economic influence of the UAE around the world.",

It is noteworthy that the quality of economic growth in India is much higher than that of China.

Historically, Ireland was a state focusing around agriculture and livestock, so it was once called the \"European countryside\", also known as the \"European farm\". During the initial independence, the Irish government utilized tariffs and trade barriers to protect domestic industries like many other countries. Under these protectionist policies, Ireland was driven to become one of the poorest countries in Western Europe and experienced high emigration. While other European countries enjoyed fast growth, Ireland suffered economic stagnation [39] . The policy changes were drawn together in Economic Development, an official paper published in 1958 that advocated free trade, foreign investment, productive investment, and growth rather than fiscal restraint as the prime objective of economic management [39] . Before the 1960s, little manufacturing was developed except for the last factories inherited from Britain. Until the 1980s, the Irish economy still lagged far behind West European developed countries, with high unemployment at 17% and an inflation rate jumping over 10%, uprooting the young to look for jobs. An economic crisis led Ireland to start large-scale economic reforms from the agricultural and husbandry economy to the knowledge-based economy in the late 1980s [40] . On the one side, Ireland reduced taxation and regulation dramatically, compared to other EU countries. On the other side, it made great effort to develop software and bioengineering. The Irish economy grew rapidly during the 1990s, which saw the beginning of unprecedented economic growth in a phenomenon known as the \"Celtic Tiger\" [41] . Since 1995, the economic growth rate has been sustained at a high speed of 9%, and it rose to 10.5% in 2000.

Irish local software enterprises earn 1.4 billion EUR and exports rose to 1.2 billion EUR, 73% of the overall sales. Irish software enterprises mainly engage in development and customization, localization and internationalization, production and sales and technical support, and are involved in fields such as communication products, bank/finance, software tools and middleware, Internet applications, multimedia and computer training, etc. Due to years of efforts, Ireland has grown gradually into an international leader in OLE, mobile communications, enterprise management, middleware, encryption technology and safety. Besides, great progress has also been made in the service sector like financial services, customer services, long-range learning and contact centers. From the very beginning Irish indigenous software companies sold the software products overseas and established an export-oriented sector.

Based on a prior plan, the National IT Plan (1986) for the second five-year plan emphasized the usage of network technologies; it encouraged using data fusion and data interchange to deepen the computerization of public administrative affairs, and encouraged private enterprises to participate in this work. After that, IT2000 (1992) was implemented to build a high-speed multimedia network within 10 years, to popularize information technologies and to build a widely connected electronic society in regional and global areas, which would create the vision of a \"wired island\". In June 1998, the Singapore government launched Singapore ONE throughout the island which would provide 200 interactive services including multimedia format, connect the island to the Internet by optical fiber, and provide a high-speed access to over 80 countries by three international digital telephone networks, three satellite transmission stations and seabed cables and pipelines. In order to encourage all the industries to set up online agencies, Singapore established e-Business Industry Development Scheme in September 1999 derived from Local Enterprise Electronic Commerce Program. In 2000, five agencies of the Singapore government took the lead, two of which merged to form the Infocomm Development Authority that expressed Infocomm21 [52] aiming at becoming \"the first-class economy\" by 2005 in the network era. In June 2006, the government announced the Intelligent Nation (iN2015) Masterplan with the vision of being An Intelligent Nation, A Global City, powered by Infocomm [53] with the objective to strengthen Singapore's global economic competitiveness in the next ten years through a series of activities beneficial to the public, enterprises and global society. After the iN2015, Singapore implemented the Next Generation National Broadband Network (NBN), which referred to a national FTTH network with the highest speed of 1Gbps. This plan expected that by 2012 the NBN coverage rate of families and offices would achieve 95%, and 100% by 2013. As the supplement of wired broadband, the Singapore government expressed Wireless@SG (2006 At present, Singapore has over 7,500 national wireless network pots covering airports, shopping centers and business districts, and more than 1.3 million customers, of whom 0.42 million use the network more than three hours per month on average.",

As a result, Republic of Korea can not reach fast development just by traditional industries such as agriculture and extractive industries. The development of Republic of Korea has experienced various stages. In the 1950s, the ROK's economy recovered from the edge of economic depression. In the 1960s, Republic of Korea released an export-oriented economic development strategy and launched the first five-year economic development plan. After the successful implementation of the export-oriented economic development strategy, Republic of Korea joined newly-emerging nations in 1970s. Republic of Korea had been a competitive country in the international market in the 1980s and set being a developed country as the development goal in the 1990s. Now Republic of Korea has become one of the developed countries mostly dependent on exports, especially focusing on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. Moreover, Republic of Korea has great advantages in the automobile and ship industries. The production capacity of the ROK's automobile industry was 3.2 million units in 2002, ranking it 6th in the world, while the total tonnage of the ships that Republic of Korea manufactured was 7.59 million, ranking it first in the world. A highly developed transportation industry provides a good foundation for e-commerce, especially in logistics. Meanwhile, the electronics industry of Republic of Korea is one of the world's ten top electronics industries with fast development in semiconductor integrated circuits. The government has paid a lot of attention to the information technology industry and constantly increased the investment in the information technology industry. Now, household appliances, mobile phones, notebook computers, computer monitors and other electronic products produced by ROK's firms have a strong competitive edge in the international market. Republic of Korea is one of the most developed e-commerce countries in the world and its broadband coverage ranks in the top 3 in the world. This provides the infrastructure to develop e-commerce in Republic of Korea. Meanwhile, e-government in Republic of Korea has also developed well.",

The MIC has the power to grant or revoke telecom licenses. The ROK's Communications Commission (KCC) under the MIC is responsible for the following tasks: deliberating issues about fair competition and consumer protection in the telecoms industry, arbitrating disputes between telecoms service providers and users, and enforcing corrective measures and imposing fines on unfair competition practices. Because the responsibility between the MIC and the MOCIE sometimes overlap, there is a collision of interests over major policy issues. The Informatization Promotion Committee under the prime minister also provides policies in terms of setting broad policy directions and agendas. The ROK's Institute for e-commerce (KIEC), established in 1999, facilitates government-industry co-operation in developing local e-commerce infrastructure and sets internationally consistent standards. The KIEC also operates as a dispute-resolution organization and promotes e-commerce workforce-development programs. The central electronic-government website, www.egov.go.kr, offers many types of public services online. Government procurement, taxation, and fiscal and payroll management are also based on information technology. Government procurement is a driving force behind the growth of government-to-business (G2B) e-commerce. The government's central G2B platform (www.g2b.go.kr) offers extensive e-commerce opportunities to domestic and foreign businesses.

In addition, Republic of Korea has the cheapest, fastest broadband in the world. In 2009, most apartments and houses had the capacity to subscribe to 100 Mbps Internet connection for 33000 KRW ($30) or less, depending on the contract period. So far, there are no limits to these services. The high speed of Internet connection is mainly offered by three major companies-LG, KT and SK.

There are two basic e-commerce laws: 1) the Basic Act on Electronic Transactions and 2) the Electronic Signature Act. These laws were implemented in 1999, broadly defining how e-commerce is regulated and online market transactions should be handled legally in Republic of Korea. The Basic Act on Electronic Transactions is recommended for ROK's e-commerce regulations including consumer privacy protection. For example, online dealers are not allowed to use or give access to third-party personal information received through e-commerce unless they have obtained the consent from the customer. The purpose of the Electronic Signature Act is to achieve the security of electronic documents by placing a computerized signature on authorized documentation. It gives business people the opportunity to interact with a wide variety of clients in other countries and the convenience of authorizing documentation generated through electronic means. In 2002, the Electronic Signature Act was amended so that it could match different forms of electronic signatures that are now being accepted in Republic of Korea. Such digital forms include fingerprint, voice, and iris recognition.",

In the United States, the Government exempted the tax on e-commerce transactions and provided a priority for the declaration of goods transacted by e-commerce. Meanwhile, the goods sold in a traditional way are often delayed at customs or given some punitive treatment, in order to force enterprises to adopt e-commerce technology. The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation of China (MOFTEC) also announced in 1998 that foreign trade enterprises would lose the bidding qualification of the export quota if they did not develop e-commerce from January, 2000.

As far as the soft environment is concerned, almost all countries pay attention to the legislation, emphasizing integration with international regulations and customs. In fact, international regulations and customs almost all originated from those of the United States, which can also present the leading power of the United States in e-commerce. In national e-commerce strategies, many countries propose to reduce the Internet fees, especially those developing countries. The Internet fees in most of the developing countries are high, which further hinders the development of e-commerce. Take China as an example, the reasons why the Internet fee is the most expensive in the world lie in two aspects. One is the monopoly in the telecommunications industry and the other is an incomplete infrastructure. As far as India is concerned, its economic infrastructure construction is relatively backward, which has influenced the growth of logistics and ultimately affected the development of e-commerce. It is urgent for India to perfect e-commerce infrastructure construction including the constructions of railways, highways, airports and ports as well as information infrastructure.",

India and Ireland were the first two nations which made a long-term development strategy for IT. Consistent with this, India and Ireland have been great powers in the IT field and their status in the new economy has exceeded many developed countries such as Japan, Germany, Great Britain and France. Although the economic growth rate in India was slower than that in China in recent years, its quality of economic growth is better than China's. There are some characters in the economic growth of India. First, the service industry is the dominant industry in India instead of the manufacturing industry. Second, the gap between the wealthy and poor has not been enhanced. Last, its economic growth does not strongly depend on the international market. All of this shows that India has more sustainable development potential than China. In contrast, Japan realized the importance of IT only after its long-term economic recession and its IT development strategy was established during the middle and late 1990s. This is why Japan, as the third great economic power, should learn from India in the IT area. The establishment time of China's e-commerce strategy is generally the same as that of Japan's e-commerce strategy. For China has fell behind India in e-commerce for many years, China should not only pursue developed countries such as the United States, Japan, France, Germany and Great Britain but also keep up with developing countries such as India and Ireland in IT and e-commerce areas.",
