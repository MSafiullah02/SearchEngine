APN is also a receptor for coronaviruses, the pathogenesis of upper respiratory infection. In recent years, the identification of activities of anti-APN/CD13 monoclonal antibody and natural/synthetic APN inhibitors suggests that APN plays a crucial role in modulating bioactive peptide responses (pain management, vasopressin release) and in influencing immune functions and major biological events (cell proliferation, secretion, invasion, angiogenesis).2 Therefore, the development of APN inhibitors may be of clinically significance for the discovery of anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory agents.",

For example, AHPA ((2S,3R)-3-amino-2-hydroxyl-4-phenylbutanoic acid) is a common scaffold in many natural APN inhibitors. The co-crystal complex of APN and Bestatin (AHPA-Leu) from Escherichia coli indicated that the hydroxyl and carbonyl belong to zinc binding group (ZBG).

Considering the structural similarity between compound 1 and AHPA, this molecule could act as a new lead compound for further chemical modification and optimization. Therefore, different amino acids and other functional groups can be coupled with compound 1 to generate diverse dipeptide and tripetide derivatives. In this article, we would like to describe the synthesis, enzymatic evaluation and possible binding mode of the chloramphenicol amine derivates.",
