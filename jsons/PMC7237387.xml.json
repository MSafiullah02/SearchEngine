Hospitals, specialties, and professional groups are spurring one another on to adopt progressively more aggressive infection control measures that often exceed the core standards set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Hospitals are caught in a cycle wherein whenever one hospital moves to new standard practice that is perceived as more protective, another feels intense pressure to follow. Professional societies accelerate the cycle by making unilateral proclamations about expected standards for their members. As soon as one hospital agrees to the new standard, providers at other institutions point to these examples as de facto evidence that their hospital must follow. Examples include universal masking of providers and patients; decreasing thresholds to test asymptomatic patients; using face shields and N95 respirators regardless of symptoms and test results; novel additions to the list of aerosol-generating procedures; and more comprehensive personal protective equipment including hair, shoe, and leg covers.",

We are all alarmed by the news of countless COVID-19\u2013related deaths; the case fatality rate is at least 10 times that of seasonal influenza.1 Perhaps more terrifying is the fact that many of the patients who are dying are young and healthy, and many are healthcare workers. In China, 4% of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the first month occurred among medical staff, and even higher rates have been reported in Europe.2 In many cases, these infections were due to delayed recognition of COVID-19 rather than PPE failures, but the impression has nonetheless taken hold that healthcare workers using standard PPE are not safe.",

In February, the WHO recommended contact and droplet precautions (ie, gown, gloves, medical masks, and eye protection) for most COVID-19 patients while reserving N95 respirators or powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) for patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures.3 The CDC initially recommended N95 respirators for all COVID-19 patients but shifted to allowing medical masks in times of N95 shortages. This shift gives the impression that CDC guidance is driven by supply shortages rather than science and that medical masks are inferior to N95 respirators. This concern is further exacerbated by scattered reports raising the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may be carried in aerosols, although none of these have yet demonstrated aerosol-based transmission.4-6\n",

Several studies have now documented that presymptomatic patients are contagious and have high viral burdens.7-9 But there is a tendency to conflate the estimated prevalence of asymptomatic infection among patients with confirmed infections, thought to range between 20% and 50%, with the estimated prevalence of asymptomatic infection in the general population, which appears to be closer to 1%\u20132% in most areas.8,10-12 These findings compel providers to want to test all patients and to use maximal precautions regardless of symptoms and epidemiological risk factors. Even negative tests are not trusted following reports that the sensitivity of a single nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test may be as low as 70% and that a nonnegligible number of confirmed cases initially tested negative.13,14 Indeed, the CDC recently updated their guidance to recommend that hospitals in areas with high community prevalence of COVID-19 consider using N95 respirators in all asymptomatic patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures regardless of SARS-CoV-2 testing results.15\n",

One of the most contentious issues is deciding which procedures are \u201caerosol generating\u201d and therefore warrant N95 respirators. Unfortunately, there are no universally accepted criteria. Intubation, bronchoscopy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, nebulization, and noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation have been associated with respiratory virus transmissions, but little or no compelling data have documented respiratory virus transmission for most other procedures.16 Nonetheless, an increasing number of professional societies are creating their own definitions of aerosol-generating procedures based on theoretical concerns rather than documented transmissions.17-20 These procedures now include endoscopies, laparoscopies, nasogastric tube placements, labor and delivery, and any other procedure that has the potential to induce coughing. However, coughing is a cardinal symptom of COVID-19 even in the absence of a procedure, so it is difficult to understand how a procedure that merely induces coughing is meaningfully different from routine care of a COVID-19 patient.",

We fear this will include N95 respirators, face-shields, gown, and gloves for all patient encounters regardless of symptoms, and likely even more PPE for symptomatic patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures. Symptomatic patients will be tested multiple times using PCRs followed by serological tests if PCR testing is negative. Furthermore, all patients will be tested for COVID-19 upon hospital admission and serially thereafter. Patients undergoing elective surgeries and procedures will also be tested for COVID-19 once if not twice, even if negative test results do not allay providers\u2019 desire to use full PPE including N95 respirators. To decrease the risk of healthcare exposures from staff, more hospitals will likely begin regularly screening providers with COVID-19 tests and checking serologies. The timetable for hospitals to reach this point will vary by access to resources, local competition, provider pressure, and local COVID-19 prevalence (and indeed, some hospitals in the hardest hit areas have already adopted many of these strategies), but it increasingly seems that this will be the end game for most hospitals around the country.",

We believe that several lines of evidence are needed to inform these strategies. First, we need better data on the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, in particular the degree to which infection is transmitted via the airborne route versus droplets and fomites during routine care. Second, a standardized and evidence-based list of aerosol-generating procedures must be defined, ideally based on studies documenting respiratory virus transmission rather than theoretical concerns alone. Third, we need more studies of the prevalence of positive tests in asymptomatic patients particularly in regions with high overall case rates. Ideally, these data will be gathered locally and repeatedly to allow providers and hospitals to titrate their infection control measures and PPE use for asymptomatic patients according to local risk. Fourth, a better understanding of the negative predictive value of both PCR and serological tests are needed to help optimize testing strategies. Fifth, studies should be conducted comparing the efficacy (or lack thereof) of N95 respirators compared to medical masks for preventing COVID-19 infections, similar to prior cluster randomized trials conducted for prevention of influenza in healthcare workers.23,24 Sixth, a better understanding of the significance of serological tests\u2014in particular the degree and duration for which IgG antibodies confer immunity\u2014may allow hospitals to strategically deploy healthcare workers to minimize risk as well as PPE use. Lastly, of course, the development and rapid deployment of an effective vaccine could completely change the infection control landscape. Until then, however, hospitals will continue to be driven by providers\u2019 requests, peer hospitals\u2019 actions, and professional societies\u2019 pressure on the relentless march toward universal SARS-CoV-2 testing, universal masking of providers and patients, and universal use of face shields and N95 respirators for all patient encounters.",
