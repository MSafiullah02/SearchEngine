Rapidly identifying and quarantining infected individuals is one of the most important strategies available to contain the virus. However, each diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 test costs 30-50 US dollars [1] . Therefore, testing every individual in a population regularly, as may be essential to eliminating the virus, is very expensive. The costs are unaffordable for most low-income countries with limited resources for massive SARS-CoV-2 testing. It is therefore important to ask: are there more efficient ways to find infected people?",

Dorfman's algorithm reduces the number of tests per person, required to find all infected individuals, to \u2248 2 \u221a p at low prevalence p (see Appendix A). We shall describe an algorithm which requires only \u2248 ep ln(1/p) tests per person at low p, substantially improving on Dorfman's. Our algorithm is largely parallel, so that finding an infected individual usually happens in a single step. There are algorithms which require fewer tests, such as binary searches. However, they are adaptive and hence serial. As the prevalence falls, the optimal group size N grows, and adaptive searches take longer and longer. During this time, the disease continues to spread. We detail below how, at low prevalence (see, e.g., Ref. [7] ), this effect disfavours adaptive searches. Among parallel algorithms, ours scales similarly to the best ones known in the literature (see Appendix B).",

As we shall see, the optimal group size N is chosen so that the first test, conducted on the whole group, is usually negative. Now consider the case where only one individual is infected. The idea behind our algorithm is geometrical: we pool subsamples, prior to testing, in the pattern suggested by a high-dimensional hypercube.

Altogether, there are DL slices, each consisting of N/L = L D\u22121 points. We combine the L D\u22121 subsamples corresponding to each slice. If there is just one infected individual, then one slice out of the L slices, taken in each of the D directions, will yield a positive result.

We now compare our search algorithm with those already considered, for diverse purposes, in computer science or mathematical statistics. Information theory sets a lower bound on the number of tests per person required to identify an infected individual (see Appendix B). At low p, this bound is \u2248 p log 2 (1/p). Binary searches approach this limit by performing an iterated series of tests (see, e.g, Refs. [9, 10] ). These algorithms require fewer tests than ours by a factor of e ln 2 \u2248 1.88. However, when considering a rapidly spreading infectious disease like COVID-19, saving time is important because infected individuals who are still at large can infect others. A parallel, or largely parallel, search such as ours reduces this risk. In contrast, binary searches are adaptive and must be performed serially. At low prevalence, the optimal group size N scales as 1/p .

A binary search takes log 2 N \u223c log 2 (1/p) steps to find an infected individual [9] . Each PCR test takes several hours, to which must be added any time taken for subsample sorting and selection. So, multiple of rounds of testing would consume significant time. During this period, the prevalence p of the virus grows exponentially. The doubling time for the virus is somewhat uncertain but it has been recently estimated, using data from China [3] , to be \u03c4 2 \u22482.4 days. If each PCR test takes \u03c4 days, the viral prevalence grows by \u223c (1/p) \u03c4 /\u03c4 2 during an adaptive search. It follows that, at fixed \u03c4 /\u03c4 2 , the adaptive algorithms do worse at low p. For example, if we assume that at most 3 rounds of adaptive PCR tests may be performed in a working day, then \u03c4 = 1/3 day. For prevalences p below (e ln 2) \u2212\u03c4 2 /\u03c4 \u2248 1 per cent, a parallel approach like ours is then preferred. Reducing the costs of staff and lab time also favours a largely parallel strategy.",

This should incentivize decision-makers to act firmly in the early phases of the pandemic. Although driving the prevalence down initially is costly, maintaining a low prevalence thereafter and, indeed, eliminating COVID-19 altogether, will become progressively more affordable. In a landmark paper in 1943, R. Dorfman considered the problem of searching for infected individuals by grouping (or pooling) samples. Consider a population of N individuals, broken up into k groups of N/k members each. If the probability that any individual is infected (the prevalence) is p, the probability that a group is free of infection is (1 \u2212 p) N/k . Conversely, the probability that at least one member is infected is p = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p) N/k . Dorfman's strategy was to test all groups, and then to test every member of every infected group. The expected number of tests is then",

One subtlety is that, at very low p, since N = \u03bb/p, for the relevant values of \u03bb the argument of the logarithm becomes very large, so its derivative with respect to \u03bb becomes suppressed with respect to its value. This effect means that, for extremely small p, the derivative of the corrections can compete with the derivative of the logarithm.

(iv) If m > 2, select a principal direction in which all three slices are positive. Taking one of these, run the hypercube algorithm again. If that slice contains one infected individual, it is immediately identified. If the slice contains 2 or 3 infected individuals, their coordinates are discovered in 1 or 2 additional hypercube runs.

The uncertainty in who is infected is associated with an entropy,where the sum is over all possible states and the p i are the corresponding probabilities. If a test outputs a zero or a one then for t tests the number of possible test outputs is 2 t and the corresponding information gained is at most t ln 2. In order to learn everything about the system, one requires an information gain of at least S, henceConsider a sample of size n, with k infected individuals chosen at random. The number of such states is n k . Therefore, from (B2), the minimum number of tests required is log 2 n k \u223c k log 2 (n/k) for k n. Assuming a binomial distribution with prevalence p, and replacing k with its expectation p n, we find the expected number of tests per person is \u223c p log 2 (1/p). Binary searches can approach this limit by performing an adaptive series of tests (see, e.g, Refs. [9, 10] ). However, the number of tests in each search scales as log 2 N \u223c log 2 (1/p) for the optimal value of N , at low p. In contrast, the most efficient known parallel searches, called \"noiseless, nonadaptive\" tests in Ref. [11] , require a factor of e ln 2 more tests (see their equations (2.8) and (2.10)), just as our algorithm does.",
