This includes stream gauges that telemeter the elevation of stream/river surface in a channel and the rate of water flow to a central computing station. The computed data from the telemetered sites plus the input of stream/river channel cross-sections data allow prediction of where flooding will be a problem, when the flooding will reach an area, and to what level out of a channel (magnitude) the flood is estimated to reach. This gives the populations at risk of the flooding early warnings (hours, days) and time to prepare for the floodwaters or to gather important documents and evacuate to safe higher ground.",

Flood control is achieved in several ways so that waters can be retained and released slowly after the threat has passed (dams), or kept from moving out of their natural channels (levees, dikes). In addition, existing channels can be modified so that they can carry greater volumes of water without overflowing their banks and move more quickly through flood zones (deepen, widen, straighten channels), and by adding a flood wall to retain waters that exceed volumes carried in the modified channels. Sandbagging around structures may keep floodwaters from invading them.",

In recent years, and perhaps as a result of global warming/climate change, the volume of water discharged into the river from melting snow and ice from mountain peaks has been reduced as the ice has receded and less snow has fallen. In addition, there have been periods of erratic rainfall and the wet season is wetter.

These are predictive observations that suggest the possibility of a landslide prone region. Landslides are a threat when water seeps into the hills adding water weight that increases the pull of gravity on the earth materials, increases groundwater (pore) pressure that pushes grains apart, and acts as a lubricant for subsurface earth materials. Other observations that alert citizens that there is a downslope movement of soil are cracks in the ground and trees that tilt back into a slope. A geologist\u2019s observations of scarps in a hilly area attests to it being landslide prone. Scarps are mini-cliffs often with exposed soil caused by a landslide but that may be hidden from the untrained eye by overgrowth. Tilt-meters (inclinometers) are electrical driven pieces of equipment that can be installed in slopes to telemeter movement or deformation data that suggests the possible onset of a landslide. A recent approach to identify the strong probability of a landslide and thus could serve as an early warning system that allows people to evacuate to safety uses fiber-optic strain sensors complemented by rainfall data [3]. These sensors render continuous monitoring in time and space. Fiber-optic sensors\nthat can detect displacement, groundwater pore pressure, displacement (slow slope slippage), ground vibrations, and temperature, are glued equally spaced to the surface of a PVC (flexible) pipe and embedded in shallow trenches in a soil. The pipe can bend or twist with pre-slope failure tensile strain (e.g., elastic, plastic, shear, viscous volumetric) registered as 3D deformation. The various sensors will register the location of the deformation on monitors at an off slope location.",

This can happen when toes of slopes that give stability to hills in landslide prone regions are cut away to establish a road. This disturbs a slope\u2019s equilibrium and is an example of bad land use planning that creates conditions that can lead to landslides. Similarly, landslides may be caused if the head of a slope at equilibrium between gravity stress trying to pull soils and rocks down and the strength of the mass resisting slope is weakened by overloading the head with housing and well-travelled roads. The added weight (stress) and vibrations from vehicular traffic can result in a slope failure. Also, sliding can be abetted by loss of anchoring vegetation especially where logging has been active.",

One is zoning that prevents habitation where conditions are conducive for landslips if a slope were to be loaded with destabilizing weight such as the earlier cited homes and well trafficked roads. Second, for existing habitation or planned habitation, geological engineering can diminish the threat of landslides. This is done by (1) redirecting rainwater or snowmelt so that it does note invade slopes at risk; (2) by installing retaining walls with perforations that allow in seeping water to exit a slope; and (3) by installing concrete caissons, a few feet in diameter down to base rock along the front of a vulnerable slope. These efforts are costly so that economic constraints prevent their general use. In areas of Japan where topography is hilly and where landslides threaten infrastructure including critical transportation systems, the Japanese government has invested in landslide prevention. They sealed hills with shotcrete so that rainwater or snowmelt can not seep into the hills and destabilize them with added weight and lubrication at earth material slide planes. Preparedness would require that earth moving equipment and search teams be available to rescue people who survived but are trapped by displaced earth materials.",

In addition to steep topography, the geological character of the rocks comprising a cliff, the climate, and sometimes vegetation are factors that influence the risk of a rockfall but do not predict when one may occur. Fractures and fissures in rocks can fill with water during a winter day and freeze at night causing ice wedging that weakens rocks against the pull of gravity.

Similarly, if extraction of groundwater from aquifer rock is replenished by groundwater recharge, any subsidence that has taken place should stop. Oil production at the Wilmington Field in southern California, USA, began in 1938 and caused a subsidence that by 1958 reached 9.5 m (31 ft) at Long beach Harbor and extended to parts of Los Angeles Harbor. The subsidence damaged oil wells, pipelines harbor infrastructure, railroad tracks, streets, and bridges and reversed the flow of sewers and storm drains. Repair cost more than U$S 100 million at that time. Brine re-injection was used to arrest the subsidence and there was stabilization and a rebound of 30 cm (12 in.) [4].",

First is the cost to repair the damage done to infrastructure and structures in the areas affected by subsidence. Second are the economic losses that can be incurred if a productive sector is slowed down by not being able to extract critical fluids from the subsurface without having to invest more funding to improve extraction by drilling wells deeper. This would likely mean an increase in the price of a commodity used to make or grow a product and hence be inflationary for the public. A case in point is the more than four year severe drought being suffered in 2015 in the Central Valley (especially the San Joaquin Valley) of California, USA where subsidence has been a recurring problem during past droughts as groundwater was extracted, but not excessively, from aquifers to make up for the shortage of surface water. However, excessive groundwater pumping during the existing extended drought, mainly by the agricultural sector, has lowered groundwater tables to 100 ft (~30 m) lower than recorded in the past. As a result some areas experienced a subsidence of up to two inches (5 cm) a month as fine-grained layers in the aquifer were depleted of their buoyancy pressure and compacted. If the compaction is tight enough, part of the storage capacity (porosity) and permeability (ability to transmit fluids) of an aquifer could be lost. The subsidence varies with location in the valley. One area subsided at 1/2 in. a month. The maximum subsidence was about a foot (12 in. or 30 cm) a month [5]. Another result of the over pumping is a reduction of fresh water pressure in the aquifer that could result in salt water intrusion where the aquifer extends to the marine continental shelf.",

Change in the fall (inclination) of sections of the aqueduct from subsidence and low spots on the system prevent the water from flowing as well as it did pre-subsidence and thus needs reworking. Changes in the fall of sewer lines have to be repaired to prevent sewage backup and its consequences from a reversal of slope. Similarly, water pipelines have to be reset to allow efficient flow of water. Some bridges have subsided to the degree that they are no longer above the water surface. Roads are ruptured and have to be repaired. Levees in place for flood control when the rains come have sunk and have to be raised. Building foundations sink as well and need correction. Very important in this agriculturally dependent valley and its towns has been the destruction of thousands of public and private well casings. California and the agriculture industry have the economic wherewithal to make the necessary repairs once the drought breaks. The Central Valley grows about 50 % of the vegetables and fruits sold in the United States.

This is an action that takes place most often where there is a relatively high water table in terrain underlain by limestone, a rock type that houses many famous cave systems worldwide. In this scenario, groundwater moving slowly through limestone continually during geologic time (millions of years) dissolves the limestone leaving voids in the subsurface. When these are large enough and the roof rock strength cannot resist the pull of gravity, the roof rock collapses into the subsurface cavity. The areas affected are generally small, rounded or oval shaped, and tens of meters or less across. Sinkholes have caused structural damage to buildings, swallowed homes and car dealerships, ruptured roads (pavements) including highways, and in rare cases have caused injury and death. Sinkholes have developed as well in terrain underlain by salt-rich (evaporite) strata that are dissolved by irregular groundwater flow. In some cases, water pipes underlying roadways have broken and the released water has washed out the earth materials around a ruptured waterlines creating open spaces in the subsurface into which earth/road materials have collapsed. Underground coal fires can create cavities into which the overlying rock and soil can subside and ultimately collapse.",

For example, a geologist will first assess the geology of the area under study (especially when underlain by limestone or dolostone), the topography, and determine the position of the water table that could cause dissolution of underlying rock. He/she will review the history of insurance claims against collapse situations in the area. In a surface analysis, the geologist will look for signs of potential surface movement that could portent sinkhole activity by examining building foundations in the neighborhood for visible cracks, especially arcuate ones, cracks in roads or sidewalk pavement, and depressions or low spots in the terrain as well as the presence of small ponds that could represent former sinkholes. This study will suggest the level of risk in an area but only an investigation of the subsurface conditions can give more accurate vulnerability information. This can be done using ground penetrating radar (GPR)\nthat takes a short time using modern equipment that digitizes data for ready presentation and interpretation [6]. In one Florida study, the GPR data for nine 60 m lines were generated in 2 h. Another option is to do a seismic study that will yield information as to the solid rock nature or void presence in the subsurface. Studies such as these, where collapse is an endemic problem, but on a larger, perhaps county scale, can result in sinkhole vulnerability maps that can guide land use planning for small scale evaluations of potential sites for buildings or infrastructure.

A study of an area in Louisiana, USA and noted that the ground shifted horizontally 10 in. (25 cm) in a section of the survey. A sinkhole opened up there a month later and the horizontal displacement observed was towards the center of the sinkhole [7]. Scientists believe that there is the potential to use this deformation as an early warning system in other sinkhole prone areas so that people can remediate the condition or evacuate buildings that might be at risk of a calamitous collapse. This is a step towards preparedness. However, they noted that not all sinkhole sites have surface shifting before a collapse, making necessary the previously cited methods to detect subsurface cavities that could become sinkholes.",

Ebola is transmissible by body fluid contact and this had to be learned by family members and others caring for infected individuals as a first phase in controlling and ultimately leaving a country Ebola free. The spread of this disease to other countries, regions, or around the world was limited by the general immobility of people from afflicted countries and controls at transportation centers and by immigration controls at adjacent countries for those from the disease ridden countries who were mobile and presented a transmission risk. As the disease progressed in the afflicted nations, help arrived rapidly from developed nations that had experience in disease control that experts applied on site and taught to health givers in spite of the fact that WHO delayed before putting out a public health emergency alert. Laboratories that had been researching vaccines against Ebola increased their efforts and laboratory testing on animals.

A November, 2015 report by a panel from the Harvard Global Health Institute and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine critiqued the WHO for not declaring a public emergency until 5 months after being informed of the Ebola outbreak by Guinea and Sierra Leone [10]. The Panel recommended several ways in which the WHO could improve its role in preparing for and dealing with an infectious disease crisis. Among the recommendations were the following: (1) the need to invest in developing a nation\u2019s core capacity, that is, its ability to detect, report, and respond rapidly to outbreaks; (2) the strengthening of incentives for early reporting of outbreaks and science-based justifications for trade and travel restrictions to prevent transmission of a disease; (3) the creation of a WHO Center with adequate capacity to respond quickly to a disease outbreak; (4) an assurance of access to the benefits of research that yield improved diagnostics, and the most effective medicines and vaccines; (5) information on best protocols to follow in treating an infectious disease and on cultural awareness and traditions to account for when dealing with families of the afflicted or dead; and (6) availability of funding to put these and other recommendations into practice [10].",

Given the ease of transmission, the mobility of disease carriers within a country or internationally, the populated venues where transmission through respiration can take place (e.g., airplanes, cruise ships, theaters, arenas, subways, malls), the answer is no for many less developed and developing countries that do not have a well functioning health infrastructure\u2026 not enough doctors, nurses, well equipped clinics, hospitals, laboratories, medicines, or vaccines. Thus, a virulent disease transmitted through the air could infect and kill millions of people before medical care to treat it or vaccines and medicines to cure it are found and tested so as to control and/or eliminate a killer virus. It is possible to minimize the spread of an easily transmittable infectious disease but this requires a major investment. A proactive action would be for the health capable and economically advantaged nations to work with less prepared ones to create a good healthcare infrastructure, a mission of the WHO that has been neglected [10]. This would include training personnel as deemed necessary, building clinics where hospital care may be lacking, setting up laboratories that can identify diseases at their onset rather than waiting for results from a central laboratory, and by educational programs for citizenry. Response team training in all countries is essential to initially deal with a disease. Obviously, there has to be open and clear lines of instant communication between health organizations locally, regionally, nationally, and internationally when disease surveillance detects an outbreak node of a known or unidentified infectious disease. This allows a global response to begin on how to cope with the outbreak of a deadly viral disease in order to minimize its spread and develop a treatment protocol.",

Stress levels heighten from the loss of or injury to family and friends and loss of home and possessions. The greater the loss, the higher the level of stress. Other factors that stress populations suffering through the immediate aftermath of a major hazard event include displacement, sense of vulnerability and insecurity, apparent slowness of assistance midst the chaos a hazard can cause, fear of what might come next, and physical exhaustion. There are ongoing discussions on coping with the stress of disaster [14, 15]. Post hazard stress arises from loss of employment and income, apparent slowness in recovery leading to societal normalcy, and reconstruction. In a latter section of this book, different classes of insurances are discussed that can, if purchased, mitigate economic stress from hazards losses. The number of people susceptible to hazard-caused stress and their resulting mental health problems will increase in the future because of population growth and increased population density in urban centers that have experienced recurring hazards. This is especially true for major cities (perhaps greater than one million inhabitants) and for mega-cities with more than ten million people.
